Empire Newsletter: How crypto can solve AI's centralization problem - Blockworks


Why AI needs crypto
Crypto is very good at one thing: getting humans to do one thing. This will become incredibly important in an AI world. 
Technology is deflationary and creates abundance, but it is also a centralizing force. Look at Google (owns 90% of search) and social (TikTok, Meta). 
Chris Dixon documents this phenomenon well in his latest book “Read Write Own.” Unlike internet protocols (TCP/IP, HTTPS, SMTP), internet service companies like Google and Meta have amassed monopoly-like market shares. These companies own your data and, after achieving scale, adopt monopoly-like practices to squash competition. Meta shut down their App Store, OpenAI did the same, and Google has crushed multiple calendar-app startups. 
In theory, you can use other social media platforms, but none achieve the same level of network effects as TikTok or Meta. 
Read more: AI has a monopoly on power and privacy. Blockchain fixes this.
The centralizing effect of technology may be even greater with AI. I recently came across Anthropic’s CEO interview on CNBC where he estimates “we’re going to see models trained in the next year are going to be about $1 billion…and then 2025, 2026, we’re going to go to $5 billion or $10 billion. And I think there’s a chance it may go beyond that to $100 billion.” Few companies will afford that. 
Perhaps more importantly, companies that own the data will have an edge to train models. A startup may be able to raise a couple billion, but they won’t be able to easily replicate clinical trial data or years of user behavior data.
The promise of technology is that it is democratizing and lowers the barriers for companies to reap the benefits. This narrative rings true with AI  — after all, companies will be able to embed LLMs and other forms of AI (robots, automation processes etc)  to unlock productivity gains. Like trickle-down economics, trickle-down tech will benefit many. But the centralizing effect of technology will likely be no different and perhaps even greater with AI. 
So where does crypto fit into all of this?
Crypto has proven to be very good at getting humans to do a specific action which benefits the overall network. From Bitcoin to DePIN, crypto networks are case studies on how to scale networks more efficiently by transferring the costs to do-it-yourself (DIY) participants incentivized to spend resources (time, hardware, compute) expecting to earn in return tokens which represent ownership in the network. 
The challenge is that bootstrapping and scaling the supply side of networks can be very capex-intensive in these networks. Historically, this has been one of the reasons why there is network centralization. You have 1-2 ride-sharing companies and social media platforms. But when you radically lower the financial burden to bootstrap a network from a company/protocol to participants, then you level the playing field. 
You can more easily overcome the cold-start problem networks face by attracting supply and demand because both sides are incentivized to earn tokens (i.e., ownership in the network).
Giving network participants a greater cut of revenue/profits will be the reason why crypto networks from DePIN to AI will emerge as leaders and will be able to displace incumbents. 
One area I see this already playing out is in training — specifically, reinforced learning from human feedback (RLHF). 
In short, AI models with human feedback are superior to AI models without it. The more RLHF you have, the better the model. Capturing human feedback can be very expensive. But again, crypto has proven to be good at getting people to do a specific action with token incentives, so we may be able to create systems that capture RLHF in greater scale and in a more cost-effective manner than traditional methods. 
Instead of having one company to raise a ton of VC money to fund RLHF, a network can finance this with clever cryptoeconomics.
Crypto may also be crucial to minimize data selection for training bias (data is open, accessible and immutable in blockchains) and platform risk. 
Look at Google’s Gemini as an example — one platform has many opinions on the data on which the models are trained. The bet is that companies/developers will want certainty that the models they are utilizing are as unbiased as possible and have cryptographic proofs that models are doing what they are being told.
The most exciting thing about this is that the impact crypto can have on AI is already being felt. 
AI will be explosive. Its effect will be felt by everyone, but incumbents may capture even more value. Crypto offers an interesting and viable solution to counteract the centralizing force of technology and restore the original principles of the internet. I see a world where crypto —  specifically, this idea of creating participatory networks — will become the de facto go-to-market mechanism for networks. 
Crypto is the extension pack of the internet.

Bitcoin’s price is up over 3% to $63,000 early Friday.

Not selling is still holding
BlackRock’s memecoin balance is piling up.
Nearly $200,000 in random tokens are parked in addresses linked to BlackRock’s onchain money market fund, BUIDL. New deposits come in every day.
To be clear, BlackRock is not buying memecoins, despite the spoofed Uniswap trades that suggest it had bought trillions of BOMEPEPE.
It’s long been tradition for memecoin holders, and maybe even the creators themselves, to direct funds to the wallets of popular figures. 
Read more from our opinion section: BlackRock clearly wants to take crypto seriously. Too bad it’s forever silly.
Think of it as part hat-tip, part marketing spend — the onchain equivalent of renting a billboard inside a blockchain explorer.
BUIDL’s onchain history has seen more than 500 transactions but only about two dozen appear to be actioned by BlackRock itself. 
BlackRock initially funded BUIDL with 1 ETH from Kraken and 200 USDC minted directly via Circle. The fund then sent small amounts of USDC between itself, in early-to-mid March, apparently to warm up, about a week before the fund was formally announced.
Since then, Larry Fink’s firm, the world’s largest asset manager, has been interacting with Ondo Finance, which has been acquiring BUIDL’s tokens as one of its reserve assets (there are currently 13 holders of BUIDL). 
All while almost 300 different tokens have flooded BUIDL’s addresses, not just on Ethereum, but on any EVM-compatible chain with an analogous wallet, including Binance Smart Chain, Polygon and Avalanche.
Most of the tokens sent to BlackRock to date are worthless. But there are some with active markets, which gives them real value, and not all are strictly memecoins. 
Caution is advised when looking into any of these tokens — their place in BlackRock’s wallet isn’t exactly an endorsement.
BlackRock has been forced to hold more than $60,000 worth of UBXS alongside its legitimate stablecoin balance. UBXS is pitched as a utility asset for tokenized real estate app Bixos. 
There’s also nearly $30,000 of ISP, which supposedly powers open-world, play-to-earn metaverse platform Ispoverse that can support virtual hackathons. 
Although, I’m not sure it really helps perception of those projects to be placed alongside tokens like FINKWIF, NOODS, PEEON and BOBO MUMU.
Still, BlackRock hasn’t sold any of the tokens playing stowaway in its Ethereum wallet. Does that count for anything? 
Probably not. Sad.
— David Canellis
The Works

Kraken is pushing harder for a dismissal in its SEC lawsuit, Bloomberg writes. 
Token projects are increasingly turning to online influencers for help, according to CoinDesk’s Danny Nelson.
Neel Somani, founder of Ethereum scaling startup Eclipse, says he is “reducing” his role amid sexual misconduct allegations made against him. 
Espresso and Polygon Labs are partnering on rollup interoperability.
US airlines are expanding their use of AI, according to the New York Times.

The Morning Riff
Pump.fun is exactly what Gary Gensler and the SEC are afraid of. 
It’s also one of those things that is so unique to crypto — mixing fun with the potential to profit. 
But it’s also risky, as Blockworks reporter Jack Kubinec pointed out in the Lightspeed newsletter yesterday. Folks who go to casinos are probably of the same mindset as a lot of folks on Pump.fun, and for them, the risk is worth the potential reward. 
For the SEC and Gensler, though, this is a scenario they claim they want to protect investors from. While Pump.fun says it prevents rug pulls or exit scams, it can’t stop shady people from doing shady stuff. 
So while the SEC continues its crusade against companies that have said they want to — or have tried to — come in and register, I’ll sit back and watch crypto’s latest venture play out.

Jupiter Aims To Launch Mobile App Launch By July - The Defiant

Jupiter now accounts for 50% of Solana’s computational load.Siong, the co-founder of Jupiter, Solana’s leading DEX aggregator, unveiled a target launch date for the protocol’s mobile app.Speaking during the Solana Crossroads 2024 conference, Siong revealed that the project is aiming to roll out its mobile app during “late May or early June.” Siong noted that a “test flight” version of the application is already “up and running,” with Jupiter currently in the process of submitting the mobile app to Apple for approval.The news comes as Jupiter is driving a dominant share of trading activity on Solana.Siong estimated that Jupiter accounts for roughly 50% of Solana’s computational load per block, and is receiving more than 250,000 requests from users per second.According to Jupiter Station, Jupiter hosted nearly 1.85 million transactions in the past 24 hours, equating to nearly $809 million in trade volume.The project also launched a perpetual contracts trading platform roughly seven months ago, which has since grown to capture a roughly 70% to 75% market share for perps trading on Solana.The Jupiter Perpetual Exchange currently boasts a total value locked (TVL) of $340.7 million and drove $424.5 million worth of volume in the past 24 hours, according to DeFi Llama.JUP rollercoasterJupiter also airdropped its JUP token to 955,000 early adopters in January, with the token debuting at a $900 million market cap, according to CoinGecko.Like many airdropped assets, JUP slumped during its first month of trade, falling 29% to post an all-time low of $0.47 two weeks after launching. The downward momentum was intensified by backlash from Jupiter’s community in response to Jupiter moving to sell 18.5% of JUP’s supply via its LFG Launchpad just a couple of days after the airdrop.However, JUP began to regain steam in late February, rallying to a record high of $1.75 in early April. The token has since pulled back by 36.6%, last changing hands for $1.11.JUP/USD. Source: CoinGecko.Last week, Jupiter integrated support for Clone Protocol, allowing users to trade assets from outside of the Solana ecosystem from the platform.

'Shiba Inu On Solana' Bonk In For An 'Explosive Rally,' Millionaire Trader Predicts - Benzinga

Crypto trader Unipics, also known as “Bonk Guy,” shared his bullish outlook on Bonk BONK/USD, forecasting an imminent explosive rally.What Happened: “Bonk guy” attributes BONK’s recent weakness, particularly on weekends, to the ongoing vesting of tokens to OpenBook users. Every Friday, 161 billion tokens, worth around $4 million, are released, creating a significant source of sell pressure. However, with less than two weeks remaining until the vesting period ends, the trader anticipates a shift in market dynamics.Despite the recent challenges, the trader highlights BONK’s impressive performance in 2023, noting that it was the best-performing meme coin of the year. In the past year, Bonk hit a peak of over $2 billion in market capitalization, despite many market participants believing it to be "dead."Also Read: Trader Who Made ‘Giga Wealth’ On Memes Reveals ‘Mememillions Playbook,’ Still Holds Most Of His DOGEWhy It Matters: “Bonk guy,” who gained notoriety for riding a trade from five to eight figures, emphasizes the inherent volatility of meme coins, stating that they can be "insanely volatile, both to the upside and downside." He predicts that when BONK rallies next, it will trigger a fear of missing out (FOMO) among investors, causing the token to "absolutely rip."The analysis highlights the significant impact that vesting periods and token releases can have on the price action of cryptocurrencies, particularly meme coins.The meme coin has witnessed a significant surge in its performance and strengthened its position in the top six of the meme coin table. It is currently valued at $1.6 billion, up 14.5% month-over-month, compared to Dogecoin’s 20% and Shiba Inu’s 15% drops, respectively.Price Action: At the time of writing, BONK was trading at $0.00002444, up 2.5% in the past 24 hours.What’s Next: The influence of Bitcoin as an institutional asset class is expected to be thoroughly explored at Benzinga’s upcoming Future of Digital Assets event on Nov. 19.Read Next: VanEck Meme Coin Index With DOGE And SHIB Would ‘Outperform 99% Of People If You Left It Alone,’ Says TraderThis content was partially produced with the help of AI tools and was reviewed and published by Benzinga editors.Image: Shutterstock

Crypto Clash: Kraken Fights SEC's Definition Of Securities


								Crypto exchange Kraken has intensified its fight against the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) by formally submitting a reply in support of its motion to dismiss the agency’s lawsuit. The filing, dated May 9, 2024, challenges the SEC’s claim that Kraken operated as an unregistered exchange dealing with securities, specifically “investment contracts.”
Led by Matthew C. Solomon from Cleary Gottlieb Steen & Hamilton LLP, Kraken’s legal team disputes the SEC’s allegations, asserting that no specific investment contracts traded, brokered, or settled on Kraken’s platform have been identified. They argue that crypto assets alone, which are the only products alleged to have been handled by Kraken, do not meet the definition of investment contracts under federal securities laws.
Kraken Fights For The Entire Crypto Industry
The filing emphasizes a critical flaw in the SEC’s approach, accusing the regulatory body of conflating primary offerings conducted outside of Kraken with secondary crypto market transactions on the platform. Kraken’s attorneys contend that the SEC’s approach ignores the distinct legal treatment required for primary and secondary market transactions under the Securities Act of 1933 and the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.

Kraken’s submission states, “The transactions alleged to have occurred on Kraken are blind bid/ask secondary market sales of digital assets… unaccompanied by any contractual terms or other obligations that may have existed at the initial offering.” This, they argue, could improperly extend the SEC’s regulatory reach to virtually any digital asset or commodity by asserting an associated “investment concept” or “ecosystem.”
Further challenging the SEC’s jurisdiction, Kraken’s lawyers invoke the major questions doctrine, arguing that the expansive interpretation of regulatory authority over crypto assets should be explicitly authorized by Congress, not determined through litigation. They maintain that the Howey Test’s criteria — a standard used to define what constitutes an investment contract — are not met, as there was no investment of money in a common enterprise with a reasonable expectation of profits predominantly from the efforts of others.
The SEC initially sued Kraken in November, after previously settling charges over Kraken’s staking services. In its opposition filed last month, the SEC defended its actions, stating, “it is simply not the case that this enforcement action exceeds the authority Congress granted the SEC.” The SEC argued that its enforcement aligns with the Howey test and its Congressional mandate, dismissing claims of overreach.

The court is scheduled to hear arguments on the motion on June 12, 2024. If Kraken’s motion to dismiss is granted by Judge William H. Orrick, it could set a significant legal precedent for the entire crypto industry, potentially limiting the SEC’s ability to regulate secondary market transactions of crypto assets under the current legislative framework.
At press time, Bitcoin traded at $63,237.

Analyst Says Dogecoin(DOGE) Is a 'Crapshoot,' Could These 3 Meme Coins Have Higher Returns? - Benzinga

Since its launch in 2013, DOGE has not done much to add value to the ecosystem. However, the token has seen some of the largest returns of any asset over the past decade. This feat makes little sense to those outside of the cryptocurrency community, but DOGE supporters believe that buying and HODLing their position is what has led to the gains. However, the euphoria of DOGE's success could come to an end, according to some analysts.Don't Miss:Pav Hundal is an analyst for Swyftx, an Australian cryptocurrency exchange. He noted that the future of DOGE "will depend on the decision-making of the millions of minnow investors who bought DOGE in 2021 and right now are sitting on paper losses." Additionally, Hundal noted that "it's a crapshoot. If most of these people decide to take quick profits during the cycle, you could start to see selling pressure ratchet up."Essentially, Hundal believes that the next small uptick in the price of DOGE will lead to a huge wave of selling that could potentially spell the end for the token. If this logic holds and DOGE could potentially lose its spot as the top memecoin, there are a few other tokens that could potentially be a better investment.Dogwifhat (WIF) is the next pick for a memecoin that could potentially outperform expectations. The token has only been around since December 2023 but has already cemented itself in the top 40 tokens by market cap. It has attracted significant attention, which could lead to gains if DOGE begins to fall.Trending: 1 in 4 Americans own a share of Bitcoin according to NASDAQ, how much would $10 get you today?Another choice is Shiba Inu (SHIB). This project is known as the "Dogecoin killer," as it is making moves to directly compete with and overtake DOGE. To do this, it has created a large ecosystem, complete with a decentralized exchange (DEX), NFT projects, a layer-2 blockchain, and a magazine. This focus on building out an ecosystem, along with its current community of investors could prove fruitful in light of a potential DOGE collapse.Lastly, if you are interested in politics or the upcoming election, MAGA Coin (TRUMP) could be a decent investment. The token has seen enormous gains since its launch in August 2023. It combines memecoins with politics to attract investors. With the election in November, the token could receive more and more attention, which could lead to gains. However, this token is likely the riskiest of the three due to its smaller market cap and the fact that Trump is a very controversial person. So, according to some, the end of DOGE's reign as the top memecoin could come very soon. If this is the case, many may start looking for the next memecoin to make them into a millionaire overnight. Read Next:

Kraken Fights Back in SEC Lawsuit: Is the SEC Overreaching? - DailyCoin


        
A major cryptocurrency exchange has found itself in a heated legal battle with the SEC.



The SEC has accused the exchange of operating as an unregistered securities market.



Kraken believes the SEC’s actions have set a dangerous precedent for future crypto regulation.
The legal battle between cryptocurrency exchange Kraken and the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) heats up as Kraken refutes the agency’s claims. The SEC lawsuit, filed last November, alleges Kraken operated as an unregistered securities exchange and made millions from unregistered securities.Kraken Challenges SEC’s Definition of SecuritiesKraken argues the SEC’s case lacks merit and misinterprets core legal concepts. Their response highlights the agency’s failure to precisely identify which crypto assets constitute securities on the exchange.
Furthermore, Kraken takes issue with the SEC’s use of broad terms like “investment concept” and “ecosystem” instead of established legal terms like “investment contract” and “enterprise.” This, according to Kraken, reflects a fundamental misunderstanding of the case’s legal framework.The SEC’s lawsuit isn’t the first hurdle Kraken has faced. Months prior, they settled charges related to their staking service. This latest lawsuit, however, has broader implications for the entire cryptocurrency industry.Kraken contends that the SEC’s case sets a “dangerous precedent” for the agency’s reach within the crypto sphere. In response to Kraken’s initial motion to dismiss, the SEC filed a lengthy opposition, defending its authority.Howey Test at Heart of Kraken’s DefenseThe crux of Kraken’s defense hinges on a different interpretation of investment contracts. They argue the SEC’s insistence on written contracts is misplaced, as agreements can be oral, expressed, or implied.
Additionally, Kraken references past SEC cases involving initial coin offerings (ICOs) to bolster their argument. These cases, Kraken argues, demonstrate a focus on contractual rights and obligations, a key factor in defining investment contracts under the Howey Test, the legal standard used to determine if an asset is a security.The Howey Test establishes a security based on specific criteria: investment of money in a common enterprise with the expectation of profits derived from the efforts of others.This legal battle unfolds amidst ongoing discussions in the U.S. Congress regarding crypto regulation. Further complicating the picture, eight state attorneys general have filed an amicus brief supporting Kraken’s position, suggesting the SEC may have overstepped its authority.On the Flipside
The amicus brief could be seen as an attempt to limit federal overreach, potentially creating a patchwork of state regulations for crypto.



Kraken’s prior settlement over staking could be used by the SEC to argue the exchange understands the regulatory landscape.
Why This MattersBy challenging the SEC’s definition of securities and their broad reach within crypto, Kraken’s defense could significantly impact how crypto assets are regulated. A win for Kraken could set a clearer standard for classifying cryptocurrencies, potentially reducing regulatory burdens for the industry and fostering innovation.Curious about the role of data in cryptocurrency ETFs?

TSM Stock Gains After Firm Reports 60% Increase in Y/Y Revenue - Tokenist


					
Neither the author, Tim Fries, nor this website, The Tokenist, provide financial advice. Please consult our website policy prior to making financial decisions.



Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (NYSE: TSM) has been experiencing significant stock price surge after reporting its latest earnings. The company’s strong earnings and revenue growth have contributed to the over 4% jump in US-listed shares of the firm today.



TSM Stock Up 78% Over the Past Year



At the time of writing, TSM’s stock price stands at $149.04, reflecting a recent increase of 4.38%. The company has delivered substantial returns to its investors, with a year-to-date return of 43.89% and a remarkable 78.43% increase over the past year. Looking at the long-term performance, TSM’s stock has skyrocketed by 293.58% in the last five years. The company’s market capitalization has reached an impressive $637.90 billion, and its trailing Price to Earnings (P/E) ratio is 27.56. TSM has reported a revenue of $2.25 trillion and a net income available to common stockholders of $857 billion, resulting in a profit margin of 38.16%. Analysts have provided various price targets for TSM, with a high estimate of $188.00 and a low of $150.00.





TSM Reports 60% y/y Revenue Surge Driven by AI Demand



TSM has been reporting strong financial results, driven by the increasing demand for advanced semiconductors used in artificial intelligence (AI) applications. In April, the company’s revenue surged by nearly 60% year-over-year, reaching approximately $7.2 billion. For the first quarter, TSM’s revenue increased by 13% compared to the same period last year, totaling $18.87 billion. The company anticipates continued growth, with a projected 27.6% increase in revenue for the second quarter.



TSM’s ongoing robust performance can be attributed to the sustained high demand for its cutting-edge semiconductor products. The company’s strategic expansions in the United States and Japan aim to mitigate risks associated with its production concentration in Taiwan, considering the geopolitical concerns surrounding the region. These expansions are expected to further strengthen TSM’s position in the global semiconductor market and help the company navigate potential challenges arising from geopolitical tensions.







Do you think TSM’s geopolitical risks are something investors should worry about, given its current place in the global semiconductor industry? Let us know in the comments below.

While working in venture capital, Tur was based out of Taiwan, getting a clear view of the Asia market, he said.He helped startup founders across various countries, including Indonesia, India, Thailand, Korea, and China.Through this work, he got to learn the advantages of each country and the specific issues each deals with.Notably, the data showed that “most of the growth in crypto has always come from these markets in Asia.”Most centralized exchanges that we know today and many of the projects were born out of Asia.However, what Tur and his colleagues found is that, centralized exchanges have been very good at targeting emerging market users.DeFi projects, on the other hand, have not.Cryptofolk in Asia is Very Different from Rest of the World
There are some key differences between Asia and other parts of the world, Tur argued.The first is the demographics. Asia has a much younger population, which is also growing massively in terms of purchasing power. They’re starting to have more disposable income for investing.Another notable factor is that Asia has many more risk-takers. They are more willing to try new things and adopt new technologies.“That makes a huge difference when it comes to the adoption of crypto overall,” Tur said.However, each country has its own very unique features as well.For example, South Korea and Japan are massive markets for crypto. People here are more willing to hold coins in the long term and are often passive investors.China, Hong Kong, and Taiwan are looking more towards derivatives and leverage trading. There are more risk-takers here.The Philippines, Indonesia, and Vietnam are also key markets where people initially started farming new coins. People here may have less disposable income but are still willing to invest and provide asymmetric bets in the ecosystem.Additionally, certain governments in Asia have been relatively crypto-friendly, which encouraged industry growth and crypto adoption.All this said, it is important to note that most of these users “are still very much set towards centralized exchanges.”Getting People Off Centralized Exchanges and Into DeFi
Millions of users are on the centralized exchanges, and only a few hundred thousand actively trade in DeFi, Tur remarked.Changing this will require many improvements across the entire user experience of DeFi.One key element is account obstruction. It will provide users with a conduit to replicate Web2 experiences but with Web3 benefits.There are many great design possibilities around account obstruction that should really simplify onboarding, Tur remarked.Another key element is localization. This includes providing products in local languages and adapting them to users’ needs in each particular area.Finally, DeFi has a developer-oriented culture. While this makes sense in the early stages of an industry, it’s time to switch to the user-centric approach.Therefore, it’s necessary to create simple, understandable, and engaging products that bring value to users. That way, new users will be coming to DeFi on their own.This is the part of the cycle we’re going to be facing in the next few years, Tur said.Even Losers Get Rewarded
There’s a need now for innovation that will drive users towards DeFi, away from centralized exchanges.An incremental infrastructure improvement would not be enough. What’s needed is innovation in the user experience.Most trading experiences in DeFi now are boring, Tur said. They’re just a trading terminal without a dynamic and engaging experience.Therefore, ZKX mission is to make trading social and gamified within DeFi, Tur remarked. This can incentivize users to start trading within DeFi.ZKX, for example, had 30-minute trading competitions with three leaderboard categories: volume, profit, and loss.This means that even the losses get some incentives because these traders also contribute to the health of the protocol, Tur said.It’s a balance the platform has been working to build: being a serious, scalable, reputable, and trustworthy platform within DeFi but still simple and fun.____That’s not all.In this interview, Tur also discussed:
his pre-crypto journey and Web2 background;
mining Bitcoin in 2014;
building geolocation and digital mapping services on the blockchain, now one of the use cases for DePIN;
why the team decided to build ZKX on Starknet;
ZKX 30-minute trading competitions;
perpetual swaps and futures, and how these differ from each other and other trading instruments;
creating user-centric platforms that cater to traders of all levels, thus incentivizing engagement while ensuring accessibility.

Hong Kong issuer seeks spot Bitcoin ETF for mainland China

The CEO of Harvest, the issuer of a spot Bitcoin (BTC) exchange-traded fund (ETF) in Hong Kong, is looking to make its Bitcoin ETF accessible to mainland Chinese investors.Harvest CEO and chief investment officer Han Tongli is considering options that would allow mainland China investors to purchase its Bitcoin and Ether (ETH) ETFs. That would be possible by offering its products through Hong Kong’s ETF Connect framework, The South China Morning Post reported on May 9.The ETF Connect was launched in 2022, and it was approved by the China Securities Regulatory Commission and the Securities and Futures Commission. The tool is designed to promote the interaction and integration of Hong Kong and mainland China, offer diverse asset allocation choices and promote liquidity.As long as “everything goes smooth and well” in the next two years, Harvest doesn’t rule out the opportunity of applying for its ETFs to be included in the ETF Connect, CEO Tongli said.Harvest CEO Han Tongli (center) speaks at Bitcoin Asia on May 9, 2024. Source: SCMPThe potential inclusion of Bitcoin and Ether ETFs in the ETF Connect program could be a massive bullish trigger on cryptocurrency markets, as China has a large investor pool. But it’s yet to be seen whether the Chinese government would accept such an opportunity for its citizens, as local authorities have maintained a very restrictive approach toward cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin for many years.According to SCMP, Hong Kong’s Bitcoin and Ether futures-based ETFs — launched in 2022 — have not been included in the Stock Connect.Related: Is China warming up to Bitcoin ETFs? BTC investor’s reply sparks curiosityHong Kong’s capability to provide mainland China investors with a Bitcoin ETF has been a hot issue even before the launch of Bitcoin and Ether ETFs in Hong Kong on April 30, 2024.Many industry analysts didn’t expect a lot of market action from the launch because the Hong Kong ETF market is significantly smaller than the one in the United States or mainland China.According to Bloomberg data, some Hong Kong-based subsidiaries of mainland China companies have 1,400% more assets in the mainland Chinese market than in the local one. According to some sources, all Hong Kong ETFs should account for 0.6% of the U.S. ETF market.Magazine: Binance hits back at WSJ, Hong Kong crypto ETF’s take ‘$50B equivalent’: Asia Express

Refund of $70M 'address poisoning' scam ongoing, over 50% returned | Protos


The victim of a $70 million ‘address poisoning’ scam is in the process of being refunded, following on-chain negotiations with the perpetrator.
At the time of writing, over half of the funds (14,500 ETH, worth $43.5M) have been returned to the victim’s Ethereum address.
Beginning at around 8AM UTC, almost exactly a week after the initial loss of 1155 WBTC, transactions of between 25 ETH ($75k) and 50 ETH ($150k) began to stream into the victims address. The transfers came directly from the hundreds of addresses into which the attacker had previously dispersed the stolen funds.

Address poisoning is a method scammers use to trick crypto users into sending funds to an address which appears almost identical to one they have interacted with previously.
As crypto security firm SlowMist’s report explains, the attack requires pre-emptively generating thousands of addresses, before monitoring blockchain transactions for potential targets. Scammers then send ‘dust’ transactions (of negligible value) from an address which has matching leading and trailing characters, in order to ‘poison’ the victim’s transfer history.

Once the trap is set, the attackers rely on the victim accidentally copy-pasting the malicious address from a wallet or block explorer, inadvertently sending funds directly to the scammer.

In this case, once the attack had proved a success, the resulting 1,155 WBTC were swapped to 22,955 ETH, before being layered into hundreds of further addresses.
The day after making their costly error, the victim sent a message to the scammer via Ethereum’s input data messaging system:
“You won bro.Keep 10% to yourself and get 90% back.Then we’ll forget about that.We both know that 7m will definetely make your life better, but 70m won’t let you sleep well.”
Read more: Here’s what on-chain messages reveal about the $200M Euler Finance hack
The victim kept up the pressure the following day, sending three more messages and setting a deadline for the ‘bounty’ offer.
In SlowMist’s report, published Wednesday, the firm identified previous attacks carried out by the perpetrator as well as an exchange address, OTC desks and IP addresses connected  to their activities (though, as SlowMist points out, these may be simply be VPN addresses). 
Yesterday, the scammer sent an on-chain message asking for the victims’s Telegram handle along with 50 ETH, seemingly a gesture of good faith. From there, negotiations went off-chain.
Earlier today, the refund process began. Over half of the stolen amount has so far arrived over the course of more than 200 transactions, following the victim’s confirmation of receipt of the first batch.

Bitcoin Exchange Kraken Applies to the Court to Reject the Cases Filed Against It by the SEC! Here's the Reason! - Bitcoin Sistemi


Kraken, a leading cryptocurrency exchange, has taken legal action to dismiss lawsuits filed against it by the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), citing concerns about potential repercussions for the broader US financial regulatory framework.
Kraken Wants SEC's Allegations Dismissed
This development comes before the trial, when Judge William H. Orrick is set to preside over the case on June 12 in the Northern District of California, according to court filings.


In documents filed with the court, Kraken claims that denying the SEC's allegations was necessary to avoid what it perceives as a “significant realignment” of the U.S. financial regulatory structure.

The lawsuit, filed by the SEC last November, alleges that Kraken is not registered as a broker, clearinghouse or exchange, and indicates that legal challenges remain after the exchange's previous agreement on the staking service.





Kraken's defense relies on the classification of cryptocurrencies as commodities rather than securities, arguing that the assets listed in the SEC's complaint fall into that category.
In response to Kraken's request to dismiss the case, the SEC filed a 39-page objection last month, asserting its authority to enforce registration requirements for securities brokers.


The SEC rejected Kraken's claim that its jurisdiction exceeded legislative limits, emphasizing that its actions were consistent with Congressional powers to enforce the Securities Act and the Exchange Act.

The Week in Polkadot: Monthly Active Accounts Hit All-Time High - Decrypt

We do the research, you get the alpha!Get exclusive reports and access to key insights on airdrops, NFTs, and more! Subscribe now to Alpha Reports and up your game!Go to Alpha ReportsWelcome to Decrypt’s Week in Polkadot, our regular round-up of the latest developments in the Polkadot ecosystem.The number of monthly active accounts on Polkadot reached an all-time high in April, the highest since the start of 2022 when parachains, one of the ecosystem’s key distinguishing factors, first launched.Meanwhile, ahead of the community vote on Polkadot’s JAM Upgrade being implemented, many parachains, including the smart contract platform Moonbeam, achieved near record highs in active users.You can find out a full breakdown of the statistics here.According to an analysis by blockchain research firm Messari, transactions on Polkadot also rose 48% in the last quarter. XCM messages—which Polkadot uses to communicate with blockchains which use other consensus mechanisms—were up 94% quarter-over-quarter and 314% over the past 6 months.Asynchronous Backing comes to Relay ChainAsynchronous Backing, a new approach to how parachain blocks are validated by the Relay Chain, has been enabled on Polkadot.The Web3 Foundation says that the new update will allow blocks to be produced faster, boost available block space, and enable higher utilization of parachain blocks. This could help use case applications across gaming and DeFi.Compared to traditional ‘Synchronous Backing,’ the new system may lower the risk of discarding potentially helpful block data.With Asynchronous Backing, multiple unincluded parablocks can now exist in the Relay Chain pipeline simultaneously.Parablocks are nuggets of transaction data which are sent from various parachains back to the Relay Chain for validation.In traditional synchronous systems, if a block is not added immediately, it is often discarded, which can waste the network’s computing power unnecessarily.StellaSwap gets new analytics dashboardStellaSwap, one of the most popular DEXs for Polkadot-based tokens, is now available on Dune Analytics.The new public dashboard will allow StellaSwap users to access key metrics about the peer-to-peer marketplace on Dune. These include daily volumes, pool breakdowns, swap volume, active accounts, and unique accounts.Stay on top of crypto news, get daily updates in your inbox.

EigenLayer’s $15B Token Launch Sparks Division for Excluding US, China - Coin Edition


							

The $15B valued DeFi EigenLayer launches its EIGEN token airdrop today. 



However, due to regulations, EigenLayer excluded users from the U.S. and China.



Analysts criticized the lack of transparency as early supporters are blocked from the airdrop.




EigenLayer, a $15 billion valued decentralized finance (DeFi) protocol, is stirring both excitement and controversy in the crypto scene with its upcoming token launch. The project is set to distribute its highly anticipated EIGEN token via an airdrop starting Friday. 



However, the excitement about the free token distribution is marred by controversy due to the exclusion of users from the U.S., China, and other regions. Eigen Labs, the brains behind EigenLayer, cited regulatory uncertainties in the restriction posed to users from the U.S. and China.



Expectedly, the decision has drawn criticism from within the crypto community. Kunal Goel, an analyst at Messari, noted that the promise of the EIGEN token airdrop has been the primary incentive for users to invest in the service. 



Given the new restriction, Goel lamented that many early supporters will be ineligible to claim their tokens. The restrictions even disqualify VPN users and residents of some other countries.









Similarly, Nick Cote from Secondlane expressed dissatisfaction with Eigen Labs’ lack of transparency about jurisdictional restrictions. “Issuers not being upfront with jurisdictional restrictions leaves a sour taste in people’s mouths,” Cote remarked.



Meanwhile, in a recent podcast, Robert Drost of the Eigen Foundation emphasized the importance of adhering to regulatory guidelines. 



After being criticized by the crypto community, EigenLayer revised its airdrop plans by announcing an additional allocation of 28 million EIGEN tokens. Notably, early this year, Eigen Labs secured approximately $165 million in funding from investors, including the prominent a16z (Andreessen Horowitz).



According to DeFiLlama, EigenLayer has attracted a staggering $15.01 billion in assets since its soft launch earlier in 2023. 



EigenLayer TVL | DeFiLlama



Furthermore, the project has surpassed other DeFi applications in popularity, partly affecting liquid staking platforms like Lido and Rocket Pool. These platforms have experienced a 27% drop in total value locked since March, with nearly 4% of all ETH now re-staked on EigenLayer.

Coingecko Research: Over 20% of Top Cryptos Are Low Float | Cryptopolitan

A shocking research analysis has been released by Coingecko indicating the little-known side of cryptocurrencies. The research findings identify a unique trend amongst newer cryptocurrencies, raising some eyebrows. The research reveals that nearly a quarter of the Top 300 cryptocurrencies in the market today are low float. Low Float Cryptos- Coingecko ResearchThe Coingecko research defines Low-float as a cryptocurrency with a market cap to full diluted valuation ratio below 0.5. High-float cryptocurrencies would then have a market cap to FDV ratio between 0.5 and 0.99, while a perfect market cap to FDV ratio of 1 represents fully diluted cryptocurrencies. Among the top 300 cryptos in the market, only 24.67% are fully diluted, while a huge chunk is high-float, accounting for 54%. The numbers start to get more interesting as you dive deeper into the analytics. The research reveals that out of the 64 low-float cryptos, 54 of them were launched within the last four years. High-float and Fully Diluted Market Cap CryptocurrenciesCoingecko’s research analytics disclosed that only 74 cryptocurrencies in the top 300 have a perfect market cap to FDV ratio, translating to 24.7%. The fully diluted tokens essentially have no further tokens lined up for release.Of the 74 fully diluted cryptocurrencies, 14 were Memecoins, showing the strong presence of Memecoins in the current crypto market.The high-float tokens account for the largest portion of the top 300 cryptocurrencies, with 54% of the market.  More than half of their total supply is already in circulation. It appears there’s a strong correlation between the age of the cryptocurrency and the market cap to FDV ratio. Mostly, older cryptocurrencies seem to have higher ratios. The research reveals the average market cap to FDV ratio of the top 300 cryptocurrencies to be 0.73, which looks like a healthy figure for the industry. CoinGecko’s Research MethodologyCoingecko’s research team excluded stablecoins and wrapped tokens in the study, and ranked cryptocurrencies by market cap. The final list was taken on May 8th. The study assumed tokens with no maximum supply had the same FDV as their market capitalization. The analytics reveal an interesting perspective on the current state of cryptocurrencies, exposing current trends and potential future trends within the crypto industry.

Harvest Global eyes mainland China for crypto ETF products | Cryptopolitan

Harvest Global Investments is eyeing an ambitious expansion into mainland China with its pioneering cryptocurrency ETFs, signaling a new era in investment opportunities bridging Hong Kong and the Chinese mainland.Harvest’s Strategic Vision for ETF ExpansionHarvest Global Investments, not just content with being one of the three issuers of Hong Kong’s first spot cryptocurrency ETFs, is plotting a future where mainland investors can directly access their Bitcoin and Ether products. This vision is articulated through their potential inclusion in the ETF Connect scheme.Launched in May 2022, this scheme allows mainland investors to engage with selected ETFs listed in Hong Kong, and is a component of the broader Stock Connect program that began back in 2014, initially linking the Hong Kong and Shanghai stock exchanges.Han Tongli, the CEO and chief investment officer of Harvest Global, conveyed on the sidelines of the Bitcoin Asia conference, the firm’s openness to applying for their ETFs, which invest directly in crypto tokens, to be part of this connect program.The caveat is, everything must proceed smoothly over the next two years. The integration of their crypto ETFs into this scheme could significantly elevate market confidence and introduce a vast new pool of investors to these emerging products.The Challenges and ProspectsDespite the potential for groundbreaking expansion, challenges loom large due to the Beijing authorities’ known reservations towards cryptocurrencies and financial innovation. Most commercial cryptocurrency activities are currently banned in mainland China, though the legality of trading and ownership by individuals still sparks debates.Nevertheless, Hong Kong’s crypto scene recently celebrated a milestone with the launch of its spot Bitcoin and Ether ETFs, the first in Asia. Despite their pioneering status, the launch was met with lukewarm trading volumes, starkly contrasting with the bustling ETF markets in the U.S.However, these products were touted for their unique approach, including in-kind subscriptions that allow purchasing ETFs directly with Bitcoin and Ether, with fund managers even waiving management fees temporarily to attract investors.The mixed reception to these ETFs highlights the hesitance and cautious approach many investors have towards Hong Kong’s commitment to becoming a regional crypto hub.During a panel at the Bitcoin Asia conference, Han expressed disappointment over the slow start but remains optimistic about the potential growth of the local market, stating that the Hong Kong market, which he views as more neutral with broader appeal in Asia, could eventually double the size of its American counterparts.As the city strives to establish a complete virtual asset ecosystem, Han foresees the local crypto ETFs flourishing to become the largest in trading volume in Hong Kong by year’s end. Harvest is also preparing to launch collateralized financial products based on these ETFs, further diversifying their offerings.The two-day Bitcoin Asia conference, which took place at the Kai Tak Cruise Terminal, highlighted these ETFs prominently. Legislative Council member Johnny Ng opened the event with enthusiastic remarks about the ETFs, calling them a major development in Hong Kong’s financial industry.Despite the second-largest first-day trading volume seen in these ETFs, with China Asset Management Company leading the pack, the journey ahead for Harvest Global and the broader ETF market in Hong Kong looks both promising and fraught with regulatory challenges.

‘Stand With Crypto’ Backs U.S. Politicians with Fundraiser Plan - DailyCoin


        
A U.S. crypto advocacy group has formed a political action committee.



The group aims to support crypto-friendly politicians.



Other crypto advocacy groups in the country have formed similar committees.
Coinbase’s digital asset advocacy group, Stand With Crypto, has revealed plans to raise money from its nearly half a million members in support of U.S.-based “crypto-friendly” politicians.Launched in August last year, the Stand with Crypto Alliance is a non-profit organization on a mission to champion clear, “common-sense’ regulation in the U.S. crypto industry. The group has 164,507 policymaker contacts and has donated over $86 million so far, raised from 448,317 crypto advocates.Rooting for Crypto-Friendly CandidatesOn March 10, Reuters reported that the advocacy group has formed a new Political Action Committee (PAC), whose aim is to support pro-crypto politicians in their pursuit of various positions in the House of Representatives and the Senate.
In addition to conducting a fundraiser for the politicians, the group made several direct endorsements, including Jim Justice, a Republican running for Senate in West Virginia, and Jim Banks, a Republican vying for Indiana’s Senate seat.Other endorsements from the group are Eddy Morales, a Democrat running to represent Oregon’s Third District; Troy Downing, a Republican running to represent Montana’s Second District; and Shomari Figures, a Democrat running to represent Alabama’s Second District.“The goal is to endorse candidates and support candidates that are protecting the rights of our advocates of Stand With Crypto throughout November.” The report quoted Nick Carr, chief strategist at Stand With Crypto.With the plan, the advocacy group joins other influential crypto-focused PACs in the U.S., such as Fairshake, Protect Progress, and Defend American Jobs, which have so far raised over $110 million in this election cycle, Reuters claimed.

Bots perform 90% of stablecoin transactions, Visa says

Photo: Dado Ruvic (Reuters)Nearly 90% of tracked stablecoin transactions are not human-involved. According to recent data published by Visa and blockchain data provider Allium, less than 10% of transactions are initiated by actual users, and most are done by bots. This means that only $149 billion out of the total of $2.2 trillion in stablecoin transactions recorded last month can be attributed to “organic” payments activity, per the analysis.Krispy Kreme's Q1 beat driven by heart donutsThe report cites May 5 as an example, when $51.6 billion worth of stablecoin transactions were processed, but only $4.6 billion was actual activity after removing inorganic transactions.Stablecoins are cryptocurrencies whose value is tied to that of another currency, or commodities like gold, or any financial instrument. With the new data dashboard, both companies are tracking transactions of major stablecoins, such as Tether, Circle’s USDC, Paxo’s USDP, and PayPal’s PYUSD. All these stablecoins are pegged to the U.S. dollar.Visa’s head of crypto, Cuy Sheffield, responded to a Coin Metrics chart that suggested stablecoins were catching up with established settlement networks. Sheffield said that transactions initiated by smart contracts, without human involvement, cannot be directly compared to traditional payment processor transactions.Stablecoins have been developed to address the high volatility associated with the most widely used cryptocurrencies. A currency must remain relatively stable to be used as a medium of exchange, thereby guaranteeing the parties involved that it will retain its purchasing power in the short term.For instance, Tether (USDT) is the top stablecoin that acts as a medium for investors to trade Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. Tether accounts for over 50% of the daily trading volume of Bitcoin and up to 70% of some other major cryptocurrencies.

The Cryptonomist

Binance and KuCoin have obtained registration from the anti-money laundering regulatory authority in India, marking a step forward for the credibility of cryptocurrencies. 
These two exchanges, among the nine that were banned in December, are the first offshore entities linked to cryptocurrencies to receive registration in India. 
The regulatory authority commented that these recordings give “a little more credibility to the system.” Let’s see all the details below. 

Anti-money laundering registration in India: Binance and KuCoin get the green light
Binance, the leading cryptocurrency exchange in the world, and its competitor KuCoin have become the first offshore entities related to cryptocurrencies to obtain approval from the Financial Intelligence Unit of India (FIU-IND), part of the Indian Ministry of Finance.
This happens months after both companies were banned for “operating illegally.” These two companies, along with Huobi, Kraken, Gate.io, Bittrex, Bitstamp, MEXC Global, and Bitfinex, had been excluded from India towards the end of last year.
The director of FIU-IND, Vivek Aggarwal, stated that the approval of Binance and KuCoin represents a positive signal for the credibility of cryptocurrencies in the country. 
Aggarwal also explained that the unit will establish a working group to review compliance guidelines on money laundering in the context of virtual digital asset services. 
He also emphasized that official recognition of the industry requires the support of the Indian parliament and government.
KuCoin was the first cryptocurrency exchange to pay a fine, paying 41,000 dollars, and has resumed its operations. On the other hand, Binance will have to attend a hearing with the FIU and pay a fine in order to resume its activities. 
According to the Economic Times, Binance may have to pay up to 2 million dollars. Vivek Aggarwal confirmed that Binance is registered, but the compliance process is not yet complete as the amount of the fine must be determined after the hearing.
Other entities like Kraken, Gemini, and Gate.io are in talks with the regulatory authority, while OKX and Bitstamp have submitted plans to exit the Indian market.
India now counts 48 cryptographic entities registered as reporting entities under the anti-money laundering law. 
The meeting with the press last Friday represented the first time that the FIU officially spoke about cryptocurrencies and follows a meeting between the FIU and the representatives of the 48 registered entities, also a novelty.
India’s ambiguity on crypto: from taxes to G20 global consensus
At the national level, India has maintained an ambiguous position on cryptocurrencies. 
In 2022, the high taxes imposed on digital assets, together with the crisis in the cryptocurrency markets, have pushed many Indian traders towards international exchanges. Damaging the local sector. 
However, trading volume has returned to Indian exchanges after the ban imposed on offshore entities.
During its presidency of the G20 in 2023, India pushed for a global consensus on the regulation of cryptocurrencies, managing to obtain the agreement of all members on the general guidelines. 
However, the country has been criticized for trying to obtain international consensus without having clear legislation on cryptocurrencies.
India has kept a cryptocurrency bill in cold storage since 2021 and indicated that it will decide its position in the coming months. 
A prominent legislator told CoinDesk that there probably won’t be any cryptocurrency bill before mid-2025.

Digital Currency Group Sees Revenue Rise Despite Grayscale Struggles - Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (BTC) Common Units of fractional undivided beneficial interest (ARCA:GBTC) - Benzinga

Digital Currency Group (DCG), the investment firm behind industry giant Grayscale, reported a strong first quarter with overall revenue climbing 11% to $229 million.What Happened: This positive performance comes despite ongoing challenges faced by Grayscale’s flagship product, the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust GBTC, Coindesk reported.“The first quarter of 2024 was marked by several exciting developments for our industry,” DCG said in a letter to shareholders, highlighting the approval of the long-awaited Bitcoin ETF and the surge in Bitcoin prices. “Against this backdrop, we are pleased to showcase a strong start to the year for DCG.”Grayscale Holds Steady Despite OutflowsGrayscale, a subsidiary of DCG, contributed $156 million to the company’s overall revenue. This figure remained relatively flat compared to the previous quarter, even amidst significant outflows from GBTC. The conversion of GBTC into a spot ETF in January opened the door for competition with lower fees, leading some investors to move their holdings elsewhere.“While Grayscale expected outflows alongside increased competition under the ETF wrapper, Q1 revenue attributable to GBTC nevertheless exceeded our expectations,” the company stated.Also Read: Bitcoin Spot ETFs Collect $11.29M Net Inflows On ThursdayThe Future Of GrayscaleOther DCG subsidiaries, however, painted a brighter picture. The cryptocurrency mining pool Foundry and the global investment platform Luno reported impressive revenue increases of 35% and 46%, respectively.The question remains: can Grayscale weather the storm? The company acknowledged the need to adjust its fees but has yet to implement those changes. To stay competitive, Grayscale has filed for a new Bitcoin ETF with a significantly lower fee structure, but its approval by the SEC is still pending.Looking Ahead: Benzinga’s Future Of Digital Assets EventThe future of Grayscale and the broader digital asset industry will undoubtedly be a hot topic at upcoming industry events. Benzinga’s  Future of Digital Assets conference, happening on Nov. 19, is one such platform where key players will gather to discuss the latest trends, regulations, and investment opportunities in the crypto space.Read Next: Joseph Lubin Accuses SEC Of Stifling Crypto Growth Amid Legal Showdown

Analyst Justin Bennett Says Bitcoin’s in a ‘Slow Bleed’ and on the Cusp of Plunging Further - Here Are His Targets - The Daily Hodl


								A widely followed crypto strategist believes Bitcoin (BTC) could suddenly plunge much lower.
In a new post, crypto analyst Justin Bennett tells his 111,300 followers on the social media platform X that if Bitcoin fails to hold $61,000 as support the crypto king could remain in a downtrend for a while.










However, he says that if Bitcoin can break through the $65,000 level on the monthly chart, the top digital asset by market cap would confirm a bullish trend.
“BTC looks pretty terrible at the moment. This slow bleed is not ideal for buying. We’ve seen this before, and it usually results in a cascade of long liquidations. Maybe this time is different. We’ll see. $61,000 is a must hold for bulls, $65,000 is monthly resistance.”

Next up, the analyst says that Ethereum (ETH) against Bitcoin (ETH/BTC) is likely heading lower after failing to hold a key support level.
“Speaking of slow bleed, ETH/BTC has broken its 2017 diagonal on the weekly and monthly charts. Most likely a move into those 3.8-4% highs from here.”
Source: Justin Bennett/X
ETH/BTC is trading for 0.048 BTC ($3,019) at time of writing, up slightly in the last 24 hours.
Lastly, Bennett warns that Ethereum may follow a similar bearish price pattern as in July 2023 if the top altcoin fails to reclaim the $3,150 level on its weekly chart.
“This slow bleed from ETH doesn’t look great. Ethereum needs to recover $3,150 this week, or things could get dicier than they are. If you think a simple trend line doesn’t matter, check out July 2023.”

Ethereum is trading for $3,017 at time of writing, up 1.5% in the last 24 hours.

Nvidia Earnings and OpenAI's Challenge Fuel AI Coins Surge


							

Bullish attitude dominates in the AI market, as seen by strong price increases for numerous AI currencies.



Semiconductor companies are driving AI coin rallies, with Nvidia’s earnings report and market optimism boosting the sector’s market cap by 10.4%.



OpenAI’s forthcoming search engine launch increases AI competition, signals innovation, and may raise investor confidence in projects involving AI.





Semiconductor businesses continue to fuel the artificial intelligence (AI) coin boom, boosted by Nvidia’s impending earnings report and a jump in AI market excitement. The AI market valuation, which is now $27.8 billion, has increased by 10.4% in the previous 24 hours.



Nvidia is anticipating release of its Q1 earnings statement on May 22 that may eventually favour the bullish trend of the AI market. Investors follow up the process, waiting for an upward trend in the blockchain-related equities, and the AI-based blockchain tokens will benefit from this.



In addition, a new stream on the path is also expected, which may boost the already bullish atmosphere around AI coins. As per sources, OpenAI, an AI research and deployment firm, has plans to release a search engine in the competition with Google on May 13. Consequently, the appearance of OpenAI in the field of Google competition harbors the possibility of a change in the search engine market.



The forthcoming introduction of OpenAI’s search engine is considered as an enormous advance in the AI commerce. As OpenAI expands into the field of AI-powered search, it not only increases competition but also represents the sector’s unwavering quest for innovation. This development is likely to boost investor confidence in AI-related ventures.



In the previous 24 hours, several AI currencies have seen huge price increases. Fetch.ai (FET) is currently at $2.34, with a market capitalization of $1.986B, representing an 8.84% growth in value. Render (RNDR) is up 11.83%, trading at $11.41, with a market capitalization of $4.435B. 



The Graph (GRT) has since increased by 18.51%, and is now trading at $0.311864 with a market capitalization of $2.957B. Furthermore, Bittensor (TAO) is today at $395.96, with a market capitalization of $2.668B, representing a 2.84% increase. 



Akash Network (AKT) has surged by 17.08%, priced at $5.73, with a market cap of $1.352B while SingularityNET (AGIX) has seen a 9.67% increase, trading at $0.980312, with a market cap of $1.256B.

Bitcoin Difficulty Sinks as Miners Mull Post-Halving Perks - DailyCoin


        
Bitcoin mining difficulty sees a significant percentage fall.



This suggests a consequential number of miners are leaving the network.



Runes and Ordinals activity has flatlined. 
The highly anticipated Bitcoin halving on April 19 ushered in a new era of scarcity for the network. By reducing the block reward from 6.25 to 3.125 BTC, the event made an already ruthlessly competitive mining landscape even more unforgiving. 
Miners were braced for tougher economics post-halving, but few could have predicted the current landscape. Three weeks out from the halving, evidence of miner capitulation has emerged as mining difficulty takes a significant dip.Bitcoin Miners Under PressureBitcoin mining difficulty fell by a significant 6% on May 10, dropping from 88.1 trillion hashes to 83.15 trillion hashes, per data from CoinWarz. This marked the largest percentage difficulty reduction since July 2021 when it plunged 28% to 14.36 trillion hashes. The mining difficulty metric automatically adjusts to account for changes in the total computing power of the BTC network.Bitcoin mining difficulty per CoinWarzBitcoin miners earn revenue from block rewards and transaction fees. After matching the target hash and successfully mining a new block, the miner receives the block reward in newly released BTC along with all fees paid by users to have their transactions included. With the halving cutting block rewards from 6.25 to 3.125 BTC, many assumed that increased transaction fees from Ordinals and the new Runes protocol would help offset the hit to block rewards. But that dynamic has yet to play out as daily mining revenue plummeted post-halving.Mining Revenue DownThe run-up to the halving saw daily mining revenue spike as high as $107.8 million, but the post-halving period has seen a sharp drop in revenue, sinking to $29.9 million as of May 9 to record a 29-week low, according to data from YCharts.Bitcoin daily mining revenue per YChartsThe severe drop in revenue underscored the squeeze on profitability that miners are facing in the aftermath of the halving event. Meanwhile, both Ordinals and Runes are currently failing to live up to the hype, subsequently adding to miners’ woes.Are Bitcoin Runes a Flop?The Runes protocol, which was created to bring meme coins to the base layer, was touted as the miners’ savior post-halving, as the expected surge in activity would drive up transaction fees. Yet shortly after their launch, on halving day, Dotta, the CEO of Forgotten Runes, conceded that the response had been lukewarm as the leading project “Satoshi Nakamoto” had less than 20,000 holders. Several weeks later, the situation for Runes has not improved. On-chain metrics showed a severe decrease in activity, falling from a peak of 23,061 on April 26 to just 43 by May 9, according to data from Dune. Similarly, fees earned from Runes fell from a peak of $321,263 on April 26 to just $719 on May 9.Runes activity per DuneAlthough Ordinals have had a head start on Runes, launching in January 2023, Ordinal activity has also fallen sharply since the halving, dropping to 15,333 on May 8, a fraction of what was seen at their November 2023 peak when daily inscriptions would number around the 480,000 mark, according to data from Dune. Daily fees generated by Ordinals came in at just 2.02 BTC on May 8.Ordinals activity per DuneWith Runes and Ordinals activity flatlining, Bitcoin miners are forced to fall back on standard transaction fees generated by users moving BTC.On the Flipside
BTC mining difficulty is a cumulative metric. Comparing a significant drop in 2021 (when the difficulty was around 20 trillion hashes) to a significant drop in 2024 is not a like-for-like comparison.



It would be unfair to call Runes a flop at this time, considering the protocol is just three weeks old.



Meme coin investing has developed an even worse reputation from the frequent rugs witnessed on other chains this cycle.
Why This MattersDeclining difficulty underscores Bitcoin miners’ challenges in the halving aftermath. As less profitable operations shut down, it paves the way for further consolidation of mining power among larger, more efficient players.Bitcoin miners are under pressure as daily revenue tanks:Bitcoin Mining Revenue Sinks Post-Halving: Are Miners Toast?Binance faces fresh allegations of market manipulation post-DoJ charges:Binance Whistleblower Alleges Profit Before User Protection

Coinbase’s Stand With Crypto launches political action committee

United States-based cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase’s project advocating for “common-sense” digital asset regulation has launched a political action committee (PAC).In a May 10 announcement on X, Coinbase’s Stand With Crypto project launched a PAC for roughly 450,000 members to contribute to candidates running in the 2024 U.S. elections. The initiative, launched by Coinbase in 2023, reported on its website that users had donated more than $86 million toward supporting pro-crypto initiatives in the country — it’s unclear how much, if any, these funds will go toward the PAC.“The goal is to endorse candidates and support candidates that are protecting the rights of our advocates of Stand With Crypto throughout November,” said Stand With Crypto Chief Strategist Nick Carr, according to a Reuters report.Source: Stand With CryptoSince its launch, the crypto advocacy group has hosted a forum for U.S. Presidential candidates — before Donald Trump was the presumptive Republican Party nominee — and campaigned for D.C. lawmakers to support crypto-friendly legislation. The project grades lawmakers running in 2024 on an A to F scale, with recommended candidates including Republican Bernie Moreno for Ohio’s Senate race and Democrat Shomari Figures for one of Alabama’s congressional seats.Election Day in the U.S. is roughly six months away, when voters will determine which political party controls the House of Representatives, the Senate, and the presidency. Crypto-focused PACs, including Fairshake and its affiliates, Defend American Jobs and Protect Progress, have raised more than $100 million to support candidates favoring digital asset policies. Related: Coinbase political initiative features US lawmaker who admitted to ethics violationsAmong the races with outspoken pro- and anti-crypto candidates includes the fight over the Massachusetts Senate seat currently held by Democrat Elizabeth Warren. Republican John Deaton, an attorney who has advocated for crypto users in several lawsuits, has pushed back against Senator Warren’s anti-crypto views while in office.“Eleven primary races that include crypto-backed candidates remain,” Rick Claypool, a researcher at Public Citizen, said in a May 6 X post. “Then it’s onto the general election, where narrow majorities mean super PAC spending can tip congressional control.”According to Federal Election Commission rules, individuals supporting a PAC are limited to donations of no more than $5,000, potentially giving Stand With Crypto up to $2.2 billion at its current membership. In contrast, Super PACs can accept unlimited contributions from corporations. Coinbase has donated millions to Fairshake and its affiliates.Magazine: Opinion: GOP crypto maxis almost as bad as Dems’ ‘anti-crypto army’

WIF's price - How long will this memecoin sustain its green streak? - AMBCrypto



WIF registered a massive surge in on-chain volume over the last few days
WIF’s social volume hiked too, despite the sentiment around the token falling

Dogwifhat [WIF] has been one of the market’s most popular memecoins over the last few months. As expected, this has translated into a hike in its volumes, with its network growing accordingly too.
Volumes on the rise
According to recent data, the on-chain volume on WIF grew significantly over the last 24 hours. This contributed to the memecoin surpassing other established networks in this domain.
Source: X
One of the reasons for this would be the ever-growing popularity of the WIF network. AMBCrypto’s examination of Santiment’s data revealed that the social volume around WIF has remained high over the past month. However, there was a trend observed that could impact WIF negatively in the social sphere.
Weighted sentiment, a metric used to determine the sentiment of the conversations being had on the social front for a token or a network, declined significantly over the past few days.
This meant that pessimism around WIF grew, affecting the token’s price negatively.
Source: Santiment
A look at the memecoin’s price
Since 01 April, after hitting the $4.857-level, the price of WIF declined significantly on the charts. Over this period, the price hit multiple lower lows and lower highs, establishing a bearish trend. However, the trend could reverse itself soon provided there is enough bullish momentum around WIF. The $3.502-level has been tested multiple times and has been weakened over the last week.
If this continues the price may be able to push past this resistance and aim for the $4.382-level in the future.
The CMF (Chaikin Money Flow) for WIF also fell significantly over the last few days. This indicated that the money flow for WIF had fallen materially.
However, the RSI (Relative Strength Index) for WIF sustained its uptrend, implying that the bullish momentum around WIF was relatively high.
Source: Trading View
Whales move in
Another factor that could affect WIF’s price would be whale behaviour. Based on lookonchain’s data, a whale recently invested 4.2 million USDC to purchase 1.4 million WIF tokens at a price of $2.99.
This whale, who has been trading WIF since early on, amassed a total profit exceeding $8 million from WIF transactions.

Shouldn't All These Crypto Lawyers Start Learning About Crypto?

Fortunately, as crypto-native associates become more senior, the dynamics within law firms are beginning to change. Truly adept "crypto lawyers" have emerged at many prestigious law firms, and there are lawyers at specialized boutiques who certainly know their stuff, but this phenomenon remains surprisingly rare. This shift is crucial, as lawyers who understand and can innovate within the framework of cryptocurrency law are critical for the industry's future.

Ethereum's Monetary Shift Post-Dencun: Insights from CryptoQuant | Cryptoglobe


                                
The Ethereum blockchain, a cornerstone of the decentralized finance (DeFi) ecosystem, has consistently grappled with scalability issues. Network congestion during periods of high activity leads to slow transaction times and exorbitant gas fees, hindering user experience and hindering the network’s ability to support a wider range of applications. The Dencun upgrade, deployed in March 2024, marked a significant step towards addressing these challenges, introducing novel concepts that lay the groundwork for a more scalable future for Ethereum.



Dencun, an amalgamation of the Cancun and Deneb upgrades, did not offer an immediate silver bullet solution. However, it represented a critical juncture in Ethereum’s development. The centerpiece of Dencun was the introduction of “proto-danksharding,” a concept that paves the way for future sharding implementation on the Ethereum network. Sharding essentially involves dividing the blockchain into partitions, or shards, each processing transactions independently. This parallel processing capability has the potential to significantly increase Ethereum’s transaction throughput. While Dencun itself does not implement sharding, it lays the technical foundation for its future integration.



While addressing long-term scalability was a core objective, Dencun’s impact on transaction fees in the immediate term was more nuanced. The upgrade did not directly reduce fees on the main Ethereum network. Instead, it focused on optimizing fees within Layer 2 networks. Layer 2 solutions operate on top of the Ethereum blockchain, bundling transactions together and processing them off-chain before transmitting them back to the mainnet. This approach helps alleviate congestion on the main Ethereum network and can potentially lower fees for users.



A key component of Dencun, EIP-4844, specifically reduced the cost for Layer 2 networks to submit their bundled transactions back to the main Ethereum blockchain. This improvement in Layer 2 efficiency has the potential to indirectly translate to lower fees for users who leverage these Layer 2 solutions. However, it is important to note that the realized fee reduction on Layer 2 networks may not be as significant as initial projections suggested, and the long-term impact on fees requires further observation.



The Dencun upgrade did have an unforeseen consequence. The success in lowering transaction fees also resulted in a decrease in the amount of ETH burned on the network. Previously, higher network activity corresponded to higher fees, and a portion of these fees were burned, leading to a deflationary effect on the total supply of ETH. This deflationary mechanism was one of the anticipated benefits of the Ethereum Merge, the transition from a proof-of-work to a proof-of-stake consensus mechanism. With a reduction in ETH burned and the natural increase in supply continuing, the total supply of ETH began to grow again at a faster rate compared to the period following the Merge. This shift has pushed ETH back towards an inflationary model.







            
            

            
            

            
            

        

The Dencun upgrade’s legacy is multifaceted. It demonstrably addressed scalability concerns and set the stage for a future Ethereum capable of handling a significantly higher transaction volume. However, the unintended consequence of potentially reversing ETH’s deflationary trend has ignited discussions about the future trajectory of Ethereum’s economic model.




VIDEO




The Dencun upgrade has prompted a fresh analysis from CryptoQuant, a respected South Korea-based blockchain analytics firm. This upgrade, according to CryptoQuant, may significantly alter Ethereum’s progression towards becoming an “ultra sound money” – a concept that denotes a currency that appreciates or maintains its value over time.



CryptoQuant explains that “ultra sound money” in the context of Ethereum refers to the blockchain’s potential to decrease its total ETH supply over time. They say this was being facilitated by strategic upgrades like EIP-1559 and The Merge, which introduced mechanisms to burn a portion of transaction fees. According to CryptoQuant, this feature was pivotal in reinforcing Ethereum’s deflationary economic model.



Post-Dencun upgrade, CryptoQuant notes a critical shift—there has been a decoupling of Ethereum’s transaction fees from network activity levels, which has effectively altered the ETH burn rate. While this has led to reduced transaction costs for users, CryptoQuant raises concerns that this adjustment challenges the deflationary mechanism previously set by The Merge. They emphasize that maintaining a deflationary supply now demands significantly higher network activity than before.



CryptoQuant articulates that the reduction in transaction fees, though beneficial for user adoption and network throughput, introduces inflationary pressures to the Ethereum ecosystem. They claim this shift could impact the long-term valuation of ETH, potentially affecting Ethereum’s attractiveness as a deflationary asset.

2 cryptocurrencies to reach $1 billion market cap in May


As May 2024 progresses, the cryptocurrency market is experiencing the ripple effects of the Bitcoin (BTC) halving event that took place in April—a key event often seen as a bullish catalyst for Bitcoin and the broader cryptocurrency landscape.
This positive sentiment is proving advantageous for several cryptocurrencies nearing significant market cap milestones, particularly the $1 billion mark. Despite the prevailing market trends, certain assets are showing strong potential for growth, supported by robust underlying fundamentals.
Building on this trend, Finbold has identified two cryptocurrencies poised to attract a substantial capital inflow in May 2024, potentially propelling them toward the $1 billion market cap milestone. Notably, these assets are already approaching this significant threshold.


Tezos (XTZ)
Tezos (XTZ), a blockchain platform known for its focus on security, decentralized governance, and scalability, is nearing a market cap of $910 million. Currently priced at $0.9277, marking a 4.50% increase over the last day, the ecosystem has shown notable activities.

Recently, the Tezos Foundation has partnered with Magic to enhance the onboarding process for decentralized applications (dApps). This will integrate Magic’s wallet solutions with the Tezos blockchain to improve user experiences, particularly by simplifying the processes for web3 applications.
Furthermore, Rarible, a key player in the digital marketplace space, is set to incorporate Tezos on its aggregated platform. This development underscores Tezos’ expanding influence and adoption in the NFT and broader digital asset markets.
Despite a challenging market environment, Tezos has shown resilience. According to CoinCodex, Tezos is expected to see a 6.54% price increase, potentially reaching around $1.020 by May 31. 
The Fear & Greed Index stands at 66, pointing to strong market interest in Tezos. Over the last 30 days, these indicators highlight its robust fundamentals and the strong support it continues to receive from its community and developers.
JasmyCoin (JASMY)
JasmyCoin (JASMY) , which integrates IoT and blockchain technologies to empower users with data sovereignty, is currently demonstrating promising growth with a market cap nearing $905 million and a price of $0.01836. 
JasmyCoin price and market cap. Source: CoinMarketCap
According to CoinCodex, the price of JasmyCoin is predicted to rise by 152% and reach $0.0474 by May 31. The technical indicators suggest a neutral current sentiment, while the Fear & Greed Index indicates a level of 66.
Both Tezos and JasmyCoin are aligned with broader market trends and are poised to benefit from any positive shifts in market sentiment.
These two cryptocurrencies are likely to attract increased investment if the cryptocurrency market regains its bullish momentum, pushing their market caps over the $1 billion threshold.

This Bull Run Might Skip Ethereum (ETH): Opinion


In an acerbic X post, Ethereum (ETH) veteran, prominent investor, podcaster and crypto educator Ryan Sean Adams describes two alternative midterm forecasts for Ether (ETH) as a crypto coin.Bearish: Inevitable puberty of Ethereum (ETH)In a 2024-2025 potential rally, Ethereum (ETH) might be overlooked by investors as it is going through the "awkward" phase of "puberty." It looks too slow and expensive compared to its own second-layer solutions of various types, Adams admits. While L2s are necessary for the scaling of such a blockchain and reflect the founder's vision of its progress, it has nothing to do with the interests of its most obvious investors.Meme coin champions and dApps users (including retroactive airdrop farmers) are too focused on alternative L2/L3 blockchains, while institutional "big money" is on its way to Bitcoin (BTC).The approval of Spot Ether ETFs in the U.S. might change the status quo but, as U.Today previously reported, analysts are skeptical of the possibility of this step in the coming months.As such, Ethereum (ETH) is getting through the challenges of its "puberty" while "toddler chains" are looking for shortcuts and, therefore, might look more attractive in the midterm.Bullish: Rock solid monetary economics for "chain of 1000 chains"At the same time, the arguments of Ethereum (ETH) optimists also look strong as of Q2, 2024. Ethereum (ETH) meets this cycle stronger than in 2020 with viable overhyped L2s and zkEVMs driving innovations and attracting value.With its "rock solid monetary economics" cemented by ERC 4337 implementation, it remains the only profitable blockchain, and its competitors are not even close to this status.Also, despite the growing audience of alternative blockchains, Ethereum (ETH) mainnet remains the root chain for 1,000 blockchains, Adams says.These two theses are just "two perspectives for ETH bulls," the author concludes.Ether (ETH) is changing hands at $2,925, being 3% down in the last 24 hours.

	The chart shows that the stock market has vigorously risen from the recent pullback.
	The chart shows that RSI reached oversold levels during the recent pullback and now has risen to touch the lower band of the overbought zone.  Historically, this setup leads to more stock market gains.
	The chart shows that the volume during the recent rise is not heavy.  This indicates lack of conviction.
	The chart shows that the stock market is now in the resistance zone.
	In The Arora Report analysis, stops of the short sellers are right above the resistance zone.  If the stock market rises further, Wall Street’s hunt and destroy algorithms will kick in, taking out the stops of short sellers and igniting a short squeeze. The result of such a scenario would be a new stock market high.  
	Yesterday in the Morning Capsule we shared with you:

Jobless claims came at 231K vs. 213K consensus. This indicates that the job market is beginning to slow.

	The bulls latched on to the rise in jobless claims and aggressively bought stocks. There is merit to this line of thinking because Powell is already itching to cut rates and rising layoffs will give him an excuse to cut rates.
	Prudent investors need to be somewhat careful as weekly jobless claims series is very volatile.
	For proper analysis at The Arora Report, in addition to the weekly data, we look at a four week moving average of initial jobless claims.  The four week moving average is now at 215K – up 2.26% from the prior week and down 10.14% from a year ago.  Considering the size of the U.S. economy, a rise of 2.26% over the prior week is hardly meaningful, but do not tell that to trigger happy stock market bulls.  Prudent investors should watch the trend over a period of several weeks, not just one week. Jobless claims is a leading indicator and carries heavy weight in The Arora Report adaptive ZYX Asset Allocation Model with inputs in ten categories. In plain English, adaptiveness means that the model changes itself with market conditions.  Please click here to see how this is achieved. One of the reasons behind The Arora Report’s unrivaled performance in both bull and bear markets is the adaptiveness of the model. Most models on Wall Street are static. They work for a while and then stop working when market conditions change.
	Adding to the optimism this morning is a report of rising revenues at the world’s largest chip manufacturer Taiwan Semiconductor Mfg. Co. Ltd. TSM. TSM is manufacturing a vast majority of the artificial intelligence chips, and the data shows sales are booming.  Here are the details:
	
		April revenues came at T$236.02B.  This is up 59.6% year-over-year and up 21% month-over-month.
		January - April revenue came at T$828.67B. This is 26% year-over-year.
	
	
	Data from TSM is bringing buying into artificial intelligence stocks such as NVIDIA Corp NVDA, Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. AMD, Micron Technology Inc MU, and Applied Materials, Inc. AMAT.
ChinaStocks in Hong Kong have reached a nine month high. There is China risk, but stocks in Hong Kong represent the best value in the whole world at this time. The ETF of choice is iShares China Large-Cap ETF FXI. As full disclosure, FXI is in The Arora Report's ZYX Emerging Model Portfolio.Magnificent Seven Money FlowsIn the early trade, money flows are positive in Apple Inc AAPL, Meta Platforms Inc META, NVDA, and Tesla Inc TSLA.In the early trade, money flows are neutral in Amazon.com, Inc.

Based on individual risk preference, consider a protection band consisting of cash or Treasury bills or short-term tactical trades as well as short to medium term hedges and short term hedges. This is a good way to protect yourself and participate in the upside at the same time.You can determine your protection bands by adding cash to hedges. The high band of the protection is appropriate for those who are older or conservative. The low band of the protection is appropriate for those who are younger or aggressive. If you do not hedge, the total cash level should be more than stated above but significantly less than cash plus hedges.A protection band of 0% would be very bullish and would indicate full investment with 0% in cash. A protection band of 100% would be very bearish and would indicate a need for aggressive protection with cash and hedges or aggressive short selling.It is worth reminding that you cannot take advantage of new upcoming opportunities if you are not holding enough cash. When adjusting hedge levels, consider adjusting partial stop quantities for stock positions (non ETF); consider using wider stops on remaining quantities and also allowing more room for high beta stocks.  High beta stocks are the ones that move more than the market.Traditional 60/40 PortfolioProbability based risk reward adjusted for inflation does not favor long duration strategic bond allocation at this time.Those who want to stick to traditional 60% allocation to stocks and 40% to bonds may consider focusing on only high quality bonds and bonds of seven year duration or less. Those willing to bring sophistication to their investing may consider using bond ETFs as tactical positions and not strategic positions at this time.The Arora Report is known for its accurate calls.

Tether (USDT) Warning from Deutsche Bank! - Bitcoin Sistemi


The largest stablecoin Tether (USDT) is the largest cryptocurrency after Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) with a market value of $110 billion.
While Tether is strengthening its position day by day, Deutsche Bank warned investors against all stabalecoins, including Tether.


Stating that they examined approximately 334 stablecoins in a recent report, Deutsche Bank analysts pointed out that only 14% of them have survived so far.

“Some stablecoins may survive, but most will likely fail.
The enduring success of stablecoins relies on reliability, reserve support and tight operational controls. But these qualities are currently missing from many major stablecoins.
So the 30 percent de-peg among some stablecoins is not surprising at all. “

Stating that all stablecoins are unstable due to lack of transparency and strong support, analysts also warned investors against the leading stablecoin Tether.





Pointing to Tether's track record regarding misleading statements regarding reserve stocks, analysts reminded that Tether received a total fine of $41 million from the CFTC.
Analysts also said that recently published reports stated that Tether (USDT) remains the stablecoin most used in criminal activities.


Deutsche Bank analysts recently stated that their criticism of all stablecoins, including Tether (USDT), stems from the collapse of Terraform Labs' algorithmic stablecoin TerraUSD (TUSD) in 2022 and the removal of at least 40 billion dollars from the market in a few days.

Solana’s SOL dipped by 4% to $147.BTC priceAmong the top 100 cryptocurrencies by market capitalization, the biggest losers are liquid staking leader Lido (LDO) and Bittensor (TAO), the decentralized AI project.

StaFi Adds Eigenlayer’s Liquid Restaking Token (LRT) To Its Liquid Staking As A Service (LSaaS) Stack



                    

StaFi, one of the leading staking infrastructure providers, announced support for EigenLayer’s Liquid Restaking Token (LRT), allowing users to participate in the restaking ecosystem. Users on StaFi can now rehypothecate their staked tokens to provide security to decentralized applications (DApps) that are required to build their trust and security – or their own actively validated services (AVS). 



Eigenlayer LRT is already supported on the LSaaS Stack App, while support for Karak and BounceBit LRT will be maintained. There are also plans to roll out support for BTC LRT in the future.




The latest integration follows the launch of StaFi’s liquid staking as a service (LSaaS )testnet – launched last month – and the publication of the StaFi 2.0 roadmap. The roadmap included plans to add the LRT stack to power new re-staking applications. EigenLayer also launched on mainnet in February this year allowing developers to leverage pooled security via restaking by extending the security of Ethereum to AVSs. 







The integration of the LRT stack will enable project teams and DApp developers to seamlessly deploy LRT on LSaaS, significantly enhancing the efficiency of LRT development and overall accessibility of restaking.



Terming the latest addition to LSaaS as a “major breakthrough for developers”, Liam Young, the founder of StaFi stated: 




“The integration of LRT into StaFi’s Liquid Staking as a Service is a major breakthrough for developers, who are now free to create restaking products that harness shared security across multiple chains. Up until now, building with LRT has been a complex task that entails significant lead time. StaFi’s LRT Stack will slash time to market while empowering builders to create novel solutions that draw upon the crypto economic guarantees that liquid staking permits.” 



EigenLayer is a protocol built on Ethereum that permits restaking to enhance overall security across the blockchain ecosystem. The platform introduces novel ideas such as staking and free market governance that create an optimized system of pooled security whereby the staked $ETH is repurposed to provide validation services to AVSs. 



Simply, EigenLayer repurposes currently staked ETH (or another token)  to provide validation services to AVSs via restaking. The staked ETH is repurposed to validate transactions to platforms built on Ethereum but cannot utilize the settlement layer of the blockchain. Crucially, stakers retain their staking rewards on Ethereum. 



The integrated LRT stack will support several functionalities such as restaking, unrestaking, and withdrawing tokens. Additionally, users will be able to mint and burn LRTs, join restaking pools and delegate and undelegate staking operators. 








To facilitate the LRT/ETH pair construction, AVS restaking rewards will be swapped for ETH in the market via swap. This will follow the launch of EigenLayer’s planned upgrade which will allow developers and  LRT operators to construct their LRT with the aforementioned functionalities swiftly.

Cardano's Bullish Hourly Golden Cross; Will ADA Rally?

Cardano (ADA) is currently showing signals of bullish potential as it posts a "golden cross" formation on its hourly charts. This development has sparked anticipation among traders and investors, prompting speculation about the potential trajectory of ADA's price in the near term.A golden cross occurs when a shorter-term moving average, typically the 50-hour moving average, crosses above a longer-term moving average, such as the 200-hour moving average, on a price chart. This crossover is interpreted by technical analysts as a bullish signal, suggesting a potential uptrend in the asset's price.In the case of Cardano, the recent bullish crossover on its hourly charts might suggest a shift in momentum toward the upside. This bullish formation reflects increasing buying pressure and suggests that ADA's price could be poised for significant upward movement in the coming days.ADA/USD Hourly Chart, Courtesy: TradingViewHowever, it is important to note that while golden crosses can provide valuable insights into market sentiment and potential price trends, they are not foolproof indicators and should be considered in conjunction with other technical and fundamental factors.ADA was up 0.59% in the last 24 hours at the time of writing to $0.4575, having pared its intraday gains. ADA fell drastically on its hourly chart, forming a giant red candlestick at press time. Weekly initial jobless claims rose to their highest level since August 2023, impacting the financial markets with the U.S. inflation data for April due next week. As Cardano's community eagerly awaits further developments on the market, all eyes are on the charts to see if ADA can capitalize on the bullish golden cross and sustain its upward momentum. A breakout above key resistance levels could potentially signal a new bullish phase for ADA, while failure to maintain momentum could result in selling pressure.In this regard, a break above $0.684 might kickstart a fresh uptrend for ADA's price; on the other hand, if selling persists, the $0.4 level may act as a formidable support.

XRP Price: 'Sleeping Giant' About to Awaken, Expert Predicts


According to Evai CEO Matthew Dixon, the upcoming consumer price index (CPI) report, which is set to be released on May 15, could end up awakening the "sleeping giant" that could propel the price of the XRP cryptocurrency much higher. A weaker-than-expected CPI reading is expected to be a major bullish catalyst for the token. At press time, XRP is changing hands at $0.5056 after peaking at $0.5217 earlier today. Dixon has predicted that the price of the Ripple-affiliated token could end up surpassing the $0.6 level later this month. The main U.S. stock indexes seem to be on track to record their eighth consecutive day in a row following some dovish statements made by Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell. As reported by U.Today, Powell dismissed the stagflation concerns that had plagued the markets in April, pushing the Bitcoin price to as low as the $56,000 level. Analysts expect a 0.3% CPI increase next Wednesday. However, a lower-than-expected reading will be a boon for risk assets, which include major altcoins such as XRP.As reported by U.Today, cryptocurrency bull Tom Lee recently predicted a dramatic inflation drop. The Fundstrat cofounder sees inflation declining substantially in the second half of the year. This, he believes, could eventually propel the Bitcoin price to $150,000 this year.  XRP has been severely underperforming Bitcoin this year despite Ripple's partial win in 2023. The lawsuit is finally approaching its much-anticipated conclusion, but it is not clear whether this will be a bullish catalyst for the token this year.

Shiba Doge Hybrid to Surge 8,000% as MEXC Listing Announced, While Shiba Inu and Dogecoin Struggle



                    

Shiba Doge Hybrid (SHIDOGE) could turn early investors into multi-millionaires if it becomes a mainstream coin, like Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE).



Shiba Doge Hybrid (SHIDOGE), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is poised to explode over 8,000% in price in the coming days.




This is because SHIDOGE has announced its first centralized exchange listing, which will be on MEXC.



This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up.



Currently, Shiba Doge Hybrid (SHIDOGE) can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jupiter and Raydium, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days.




Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Shiba Doge Hybrid (SHIDOGE) could become the next viral memecoin.



To buy Shiba Doge Hybrid on Raydium or Jupiter ahead of the MEXC listing, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for SHIDOGE by entering its contract address – 797CmcxqkLZaSjMd7MdyNZ9swuSzaGdYWkJ65jehiXWa – in the receiving field.



In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price.



If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner.




The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum.



This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like SHIDOGE.

Crypto Analyst Sets $10 Price Target For Cardano As Volume Jumps 90%


																The stars may be finally aligning for Cardano (ADA) and its holders, as the crypto token recently experienced a significant reversal and a jump in its trading volume. Interestingly, this development coincides with an ultra-bullish prediction that a crypto analyst made for the crypto token. 
Crypto Analyst Predicts Cardano To Rise To $9
Crypto analyst Altcoin Daily revealed in an X (formerly Twitter) post that $9 is their peak price target for Cardano in this bull run. The analyst joins other crypto analysts who have made ultra-bullish predictions for Cardano despite how low the crypto token is currently trading. Before now, Dan Gambardello, the founder of Crypto Capital Venture, had predicted that Cardano could rise to as high as $11 in this bull run.
Related Reading: CryptoQuant CEO Predicts Where Bitcoin Price Is Headed, Is $265,000 Too Ambitious?
Meanwhile, crypto expert Jason Appleton predicted that Cardano will rise to as high as $32 in this bull run. Specifically, he mentioned that this will happen at the peak of this market cycle. Altcoin Daily’s prediction comes amidst Cardano’s 90% jump in trading volume. This suggests that more investors are accumulating the crypto token ahead of this parabolic rise. 
Cardano’s price already reacted positively to this development, with the crypto token seeing a reversal from its downtrend. Crypto analyst Trend Rider suggested that this reversal might begin an upward trend for Cardano as he noted that the crypto token was currently holding its support level very well. 
The analyst also revealed that the bears were currently trying to push the crypto token further down, but he claimed that they would get tired once Cardano could hold this support for 1 to 2 more weeks. Once that happens, Carano will bounce from its current price level, Trend Rider remarked. 
Making A Bull Case For ADA
Crypto analyst Ali Martinez recently made a bullish case for Cardano. He mentioned in an X post that the crypto token seems ready for a parabolic bull run. Martinez alluded to Cardano’s historical trend and explained why the 50% price drop the crypto token experienced this past month might be a good buying opportunity. 
Martinez claimed that Cardano consolidated within a parallel channel in 2019, signaling an end to the bear market. Following that “stagnant phase,” ADA is said to have broken out of the channel with a 75% surge and then experienced a 56% correction, setting the stage for its 4,095% price gain in that bull run. 
Related Reading: Bitcoin Whales Lose Interest, Is This A Precursor For A Crash To $50,000?
Martinez further noted that a similar situation looks to be playing out again as Cardano has consolidated within a parallel channel, marking an end to the bear market. ADA then broke out of this channel with a 72% price surge following this period of stagnation. Now, Cardano has experienced a 50% price correction, just like in 2019, which Martinez remarked could be setting the stage for “an impressive bull run ahead.”

Robinhood CEO Says His Firm Met With the U.S. SEC 16 Times in ‘Good Faith’ Ahead of Crypto-Related Wells Notice - The Daily Hodl


								The CEO of popular retail trading platform Robinhood says his firm and the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) were engaged in discussions before the regulator issued a Wells Notice.
In a new interview on CNBC, Vlad Tenev says that Robinhood met with the SEC several times to address issues with existing securities laws and regulatory frameworks that do not account for crypto assets before the regulatory body gave any notice that it planned to take enforcement actions.










“We tried to create what’s called the special purpose broker-dealer for the purpose of transacting crypto assets. We actually came in good faith to meet with the SEC. I think we met with them 16 times and, unfortunately, that was not reciprocated.”
Tenev says the securities watchdog is not interested in pursuing discussions about the subject.
“It’s hard to impute the reasoning behind that, but they told us they did not want to keep meeting about it and they did not see a path toward it.”
He says the SEC has the power to address crypto restrictions but the regulator simply refuses to make changes.
“The SEC has the ability to change the rules to allow for brokers to accommodate crypto assets and they do not seem intent on doing that. Rather they are proceeding with regulation by enforcement and that is disappointing.”
Tenev previously said that Robinhood is prepared to contest the SEC’s charges in court if the legal action pushes through. He now explains why the trading platform is taking a stand against the regulator.
“I did not want to have to get into this situation but we have to defend ourselves and advocate for our customers. We do believe that crypto assets are becoming more and more important and it would not be acceptable for us to not have Americans have access to them.”

Trump holds on to crypto as his new campaign strategy against Biden

Recently, a political-crypto gathering of supporters took place at Mar-a-Lago, hosted by former President Donald Trump. The event was exclusive to traders who purchased over 47 of the Trump Digital Trading Cards “Mugshot Edition” NFTs, that were valued at $99 per card. After the dinner, Trump delivered a brief speech on crypto, which was later recorded and shared on X.Trump turns to crypto as a weapon against the Biden administrationDuring a gathering at Mar-a-Lago, Trump urged crypto supporters to cast their vote in his favor, citing the Biden administration’s stringent regulatory measures imposed on the industry.The Democrats are very much against it [crypto]. And I say this, a lot of people are very much for it … and I’m fine with it. I want to make sure it’s good and solid … but I’m good with it. If you like crypto in any form, and it comes in a lot of different forms, you better vote for Trump.
Donald TrumpThe change in Trump’s approach towards the crypto community is a significant shift from his previous criticisms, although it was somewhat was expected. Republicans have shown growing support for bitcoin and other digital assets in recent years, while some Democrats continue to debate whether to recognize the industry following a series of scandals.Trump’s endorsement is a significant development for crypto entities that have been actively lobbying in Washington and investing substantial amounts of money to shape the outcome of the 2024 elections.Trump also mentioned that NFTs have gained popularity once again, which was met with enthusiasm from his supporters.These statements indicate a significant shift in position since 2021 when Trump expressed concerns about the potential risks of crypto and stated that he was not supportive of it.Furthermore, this position is more assertive than his previous viewpoint. During a Fox News town hall in February 2024, Trump acknowledged the need for regulation. He stated that, “You probably have to do some regulation. But many people are embracing it. More and more I’m seeing people wanting to pay Bitcoin, and you’re seeing something that’s interesting, so I can live with it one way or the other.”Biden’s administration handle on cryptoOn the same day, Biden made it clear that he would veto a resolution aimed at repealing a Securities and Exchange Commission accounting policy.The SEC policy, known as Staff Accounting Bulletin No 121 or SAB 121, adds the costs for financial institutions that hold digital assets in custody. The tax proposal introduced by Biden has sparked controversy within the DeFi ecosystem. This is because it would impose a 30% excise tax on the electricity costs of BTC miners.“Gensler is very much against it,” Trump said on Wednesday regarding the administration’s current stand on crypto. “The Democrats are very much against it.”However, there are Democrats who support the proposed bill. On that note, 21 Democrats broke ranks with President Biden’s veto threat and sided with Republicans in voting for a resolution to overturn the SEC’s crypto guidance.It seems that memecoins are benefiting from the age-old adage that any kind of publicity is good publicity – especially the bad. Even the most insignificant form of publicity.The crypto token Jeo Boden (BODEN) experienced a significant surge of up to 25% on Wednesday. This increase in value came after former President Donald Trump responded to a question from one of his supporters regarding the token.After reaching its highest point at $0.42, BODEN experienced fluctuations and is currently trading at $0.28, representing a decrease of over 19%.The Trump campaign is currently not accepting crypto donations, but he mentioned at the impromptu gathering that he plans to do so.When asked about the possibility of accepting donations in crypto, the likely Republican nominee confidently assured, “If you can’t, I’ll make sure you can.”

Stocks Pause On Dismal Consumer Confidence; Yields, Dollar Rise As Inflation Expectations Kick Higher, Bitcoin Sinks: What's Driving Markets Friday? - Arista Networks (NYSE:ANET) - Benzinga

A worse-than-expected University of Michigan’s May consumer report halted stock gains on Friday, sparking worries about a potential decline in consumer health amid perceived rising price pressures.The report disclosed that both near-term and long-term inflation expectations have surged beyond projections this month, causing the broader consumer gauge to hit its lowest levels in six months.“If spending slows down and inflation increases, we'll get the opposite of the Goldilocks scenario that many were hoping for, and the Fed will be in an especially difficult position of choosing between accommodating a slowing economy and fighting increasing inflation expectations,” said Chris Zaccarelli, chief investment officer for Independent Advisor Alliance. Echoing this view, Jeffrey Roach, chief economist for LPL Financial, sees rising risks of stagflation, a concern that could unsettle markets. At 12:05 p.m. trading in New York, the S&P 500 was 0.1% lower, but it was firmly up by 1.6% for the week, poised to secure a third consecutive week of gains after three of losses.The Dow Jones Industrial Average was a tad higher, battling to secure the eight straight session of gains, the longest positive streak since December 2023.

Cardano (ADA) Eyes Crazy Anomaly with 4,000,000% Surge in Bulls Liquidations


In an unexpected turn of events within the crypto market, Cardano (ADA) has experienced an extraordinary surge in bullish liquidations, diverging significantly from the bearish ones. Over the course of just one hour, there has been a remarkable $320,670 liquidated from long positions, a figure that dwarfs the comparatively small $8.97 liquidated from short positions, resulting in an astonishing disparity of nearly 4,000,000%.Source: CoinGlassThe surge in bullish liquidations coincided with a 3% decline in Cardano's price within the same hour. One major contributing factor could be named recent negative macroeconomic indicators from the US economy. Among these indicators, the Michigan Consumer Sentiment Index dropped from 77.2 to 67.4, reflecting a decrease in consumer confidence. Additionally, consumer inflation expectations saw an uptick, with 1-year expectations rising from 3.2% to 3.5%, and 5-year expectations increasing from 3% to 3.1%.ADA to USD by CoinMarketCapThe Michigan Consumer Sentiment Index serves as a gauge of consumer sentiment regarding economic conditions, with lower values indicating reduced confidence, which can impact spending patterns. Meanwhile, the rise in inflation expectations suggests that consumers anticipate higher prices for goods and services in the future, potentially leading to changes in spending behavior and economic dynamics.This combination of economic factors may have influenced market sentiment, contributing to the surge in liquidations observed in Cardano trading. However, the fact that long liquidations exceeded shorts by 4,000,000% is obviously due to excessive greed reigning the market.

Anatoly Yakovenko Previews Solana Post-Firedancer - The Defiant

Solana’s co-founder says there the network faces an opportunity to emerge as the leading monolithic chain in web3.In a panel closing out the first day of the Solana Crossroads 2024 conference, Anatoly Yakovenko, the CEO of Solana Labs, said that Solana is poised to emerge as the leading web3 network.Yakovenko said Solana will have officially transcended its “mainnet beta” with the impending launch of Firedancer — the forthcoming Solana client from Jump Crypto. Firedancer offers an entirely new codebase intended to eliminate the risk posed by Solana’s currently lone client implementation, increase transaction throughput, and bolster the network’s efficiency.“Folks can stop calling it beta at any time, it's just my personal preference that we do that after Firedancer ships,” Yakovenko said. “You want different people to work on the same component so the probability of a bug being in both [clients] is virtually zero.”Yakovenko said that Jump has been “making a ton of progress” on Firedancer, adding that he expects there is a 50% chance Firedancer will be live on mainnet before the Solana Breakpoint conference in September.Jump Crypto first announced it was building Firedancer in August 2022. Jump said it would design the client to “drastically increas[e] Solana’s networking throughput, resiliency, and efficiency.”Despite Solana currently boasting an impressive throughput, the network struggled with frequent outages and perceptions of centralization in recent years.Memecoin stress-testingLooking ahead, Yakovenko predicts that Solana will grow to host more than $1 trillion worth of stablecoins within the next five years.He characterized the challenges as bottlenecks Solana has faced leading up to this point as “a blessing,” as memecoins, NFTs, and inscriptions have served to stress-test the network, rather than a massive stablecoin ecosystem.“We’re blessed to stress-test with memecoins, and not with $1 trillion worth of stablecoins,” Yakovenko said. “We’re lucky to find those bugs and fix them.”Yakovenko also reaffirmed Solana’s commitment to achieving scalability at Layer 1, as opposed to the "fragmented" Layer 2 ecosystem driving Ethereum’s scalability. He said Solana’s design is intended to facilitate future scalability gains through gains in hardware efficiency, noting the rapid pace of innovation in semiconductor manufacturing from the likes of Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company and Nvidia.“This is an opportunity for a single giant world computer that synchronizes at the speed of light, Yakovenko said.

Binance VIP trader profited by dumping play-to-earn token | Protos


A new investigation has revealed that Binance allegedly helped a secretive whale trader siphon money from the play-to-earn crypto industry. One of these so-called VIPs was DWF, afforded special attention by Binance. DWF allegedly bragged that it “successfully” tripled the trading volume of a token through an artificial, “believable trading pattern.”
Some investigators estimated that DWF manipulated the price of YGG and at least six other tokens on Binance through at least $300 million worth of wash trades last year.
Not too long ago, venture capitalists at Andreessen Horowitz (a16z) told the world a story about play-to-earn crypto. Web 3 and the metaverse would become so large and prosperous that they would spawn a new, sustainable industry for offshore labor. As the result of just one crypto game, a16z wrote, “Gaming was literally lifting an entire community out of poverty.”
In these venture capitalists’ imagined reality, wealthy Westerners would crave billions of dollars of in-game items like pets, outfits, weapons, or virtual real estate. They would pay low income workers to perform time-consuming in-game actions to earn those items on their behalf. 
Even more amazing, this type of activity would become so commonplace and lucrative for both groups that the wealthy class would self-organize into play-to-earn guilds in order to use the power of blockchain to govern, lend, and distribute their assets.
Cheerleading the play-to-earn crypto revolution that never happened
The game was Axie Infinity, which sold a massive collection of NFTs plus two fungible tokens, AXS and SLP. As a result of this proof-of-concept game, “many players in the Philippines were earning more than they had at their previous jobs,” the venture capitalists boasted.
To invest in this amazing future, a16z decided to invest millions into Axie Infinity’s game studio. (Initially it wanted to lead a $150 million round yet only closed a small fraction of that total.) It also poured $4.6 million (plus millions more in tokens) into an Axie Infinity play-to-earn guild, Yield Guild Games (YGG).
A16z wrote that YGG would provide ‘”unparalleled economic opportunities” and unlock a “largely untapped economic opportunity in emerging markets to provide jobs by building a virtual economy in the digital world.”

Today, the price of AXS is down 95% from its all-time high, SLP is down 99%, Axie NFTs are down 90% on average, and YGG is down 92%. DWF made millions by selling millions of YGG near the peak, according to Wall Street Journal’s investigation.
The real story of play-to-earn crypto, it seems, is the money that has already been made from selling a dream of the future that never transpired.

3 High-Growth Tech Stocks that Also Pay Dividends Now - Tokenist


					
Neither the author, Tim Fries, nor this website, The Tokenist, provide financial advice. Please consult our website policy prior to making financial decisions.



Investors are used to certain types of stocks to yield worthwhile dividends. These are typically real estate investment trusts (REITs), banks, payment processors, large utility or consumer staple companies. In contrast, high-growth companies like Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) tend to reinvest in the business.



Soon after Texas Instruments (NASDAQ: TXN), Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) experimented with dividends from 1987 to 1995, only to stop until reissuing in 2012. Although AAPL dividend yield is still low at 0.54%, the company uses a proxy shareholder return via record-breaking stock buybacks.



According to Morningstar, compared to the financial services sector, which comprised 43% of dividend growth in 2003, the tech sector only constituted 2.10%. By 2023, we are seeing much greater sector diversification, with financial firms making 23.57% while dividend-paying tech stocks increased to 9% share.



Meta Platforms (NASDAQ: META) and Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOGL) announced dividend payouts this year. This marks a wider tech industry shift to keep their stock momentum going by enticing a wider investor base to enroll.



Here are three established tech stocks that investors should consider for dividend payouts.



Qualcomm (NASDAQ: QCOM) – 1.77% dividend yield at $3.20 annual payout per share



Year-to-date, this chipmaker and holder of many licensed tech patents significantly outperformed AMD (NASDAQ: AMD) at 30% vs. 9.50% returns, respectively. While AMD started slipping in early March, QCOM stock gained 20% value in the last three months. 



At the present price level of $180.54, QCOM shares are 44% above the 52-week low of $101.47 per share. Qualcomm dominates the global smartphone application processor (AP) shipments even more so than Apple. As of Q4 2023, the company holds a 23% share, behind MediaTek’s 36% and ahead of Apple’s 20% share, per Counterpoint Research.



In the second half of 2024, Qualcomm is set to launch new Snapdragon 8S Gen3 and 7 Plus Gen 3 mobile platforms, harnessing AI power to the flagship smartphone sector. For Q2 2024, the company reported strong earnings. Net income increased 14% year-over-year with notable automotive division revenue growth of 35% to $603 million. 



Compared to net cash from operations of $4.5 billion in 2023, Qualcomm increased it to $6.5 billion. For Q3 FY24, the company set an outlook revenue of $8.8 – $9.6 billion range, from Q2’s $9.4 billion. Accordingly, Nasdaq’s forecast sees a modest average price target of $187.05 vs the current $180.54 per share.





Meta Platforms (NASDAQ: META) – 0.42% dividend yield at $2 annual payout per share



Declared the winner of Magnificent Seven earnings in February, Meta announced its first-ever quarterly dividend in Q4 2023 earnings, to be paid on March 26th, 2024. Like Apple, Meta used a dual approach to boosting shareholder returns, authorizing $50 billion worth of stock buybacks.



Year-to-date, META stock is up 36%. From its 52-week low of $235.33, its price is now $475.42. Mark Zuckerberg spread his company across multiple pies, effectively dominating the VR/AR sector with Oculus Quest headsets, while Meta’s metaverse division Reality Labs is yet to produce profits.



Nonetheless, Meta’s deep pockets from online advertising across social media platforms, significantly boosted with AI tools, give the company ample space for R&D to continue as a metaverse stock. For Q1 2024, Meta reported 27% year-over-year revenue growth to $36.4 billion, delivering a 117% increase in net income of $12.3 billion.



In other words, Meta occupies many attractive niches for investors—blue chip, growth tech, metaverse, and now dividend stock with generous stock buybacks to boot. Nasdaq’s average price target for META is $522.49 vs. the current $475.42 per share.







Salesforce (NASDAQ: CRM) – 0.58% dividend yield at $1.60 annual payout per share



Salesforce cornered the market on cloud-based customer relationship management (CRM) with an estimated 26.47% market share. For comparison, all other CRM platforms have under 6% shares, including Microsoft Dynamics CRM, which has 4.29%. 



These services are typically subscription-based, giving Salesforce a stable and predictable revenue stream. The company announced its first-ever dividend in February, with the payment date on April 11th, at a quarterly cash of $0.40 per share.



In February, Salesforce released its Q4 2024 (fiscal) earnings, showing 11% year-over-year revenue growth to $9.29 billion and full-year net income of $4.1 billion vs. $208 million the year prior. In addition to the new dividend inflow, Salesforce authorized a $10 billion share repurchase program, having returned $11.7 billion to shareholders since inception.



For full-year FY25 guidance, Salesforce gave 8% – 9% year-over-year revenue growth up to $38 billion. Year-to-date, CRM stock gained 7.4% value. Nasdaq’s average price target for CRM shares is now $339.32 vs the current $275.30 per share.

JUST IN: Wells Fargo, the Third Largest Bank in the US, Makes a Giant Bitcoin Push - Bitcoin Sistemi


Wells Fargo, the third-largest bank in the United States, disclosed its investment in spot Bitcoin ETFs in a recent filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).
The bank's investment portfolio now includes Grayscale's spot BTC ETF, ProShares Bitcoin Strategy futures ETF and Bitcoin Depot Inc. has shares.


Spot BTC ETFs have gained popularity among institutional investors as they provide exposure to Bitcoin's price movements without the need for direct ownership of the asset. This makes them a more regulated and safer investment vehicle for Bitcoin (BTC).

This development comes alongside a widespread trend towards institutional adoption of Bitcoin. Many major banks and financial institutions are exploring ways to include Bitcoin in their offerings and gain exposure to the asset.





Earlier this week, Susquehanna International Group, a global trading and technology firm, disclosed in an SEC filing that it holds $1.8 billion in spot BTC and other Bitcoin ETFs.
BTC Spot ETFs were launched on January 10 and have been on the agenda of the cryptocurrency market since then.

Bitcoin To $1.3M By 2028? Questionable, Says 10x Research - Benzinga

Bitcoin BTC/USD bulls hoping for a seven-figure price by 2028 may be disappointed, according to a new report by 10x Research. What Happened: The report, authored by Markus Thielen, questions the validity of the Stock-to-Flow (STF) model in predicting future Bitcoin prices.“The STF model predicted a price of $110,793 for Bitcoin in the last cycle, which clearly didn’t happen,” Thielen states in the report. “This casts doubt on its ability to accurately forecast future prices, particularly the ambitious $1.3 million projection for the current cycle.”STF Model Under ScrutinyThe STF model, often used by Bitcoin proponents, compares the current supply of an asset to its annual production rate.A higher ratio suggests greater scarcity, leading to a higher price. However, Thielen argues that the model doesn’t account for human behavior and changing market dynamics.“The model assumes that higher prices will not incentivize increased production,” Thielen explains. “While this might hold true for gold, Bitcoin mining can be readily adjusted based on profitability.”Diminishing Returns And Cycle AnalysisThe report also highlights a potential weakening in Bitcoin’s historical cycle pattern. 10x Research observed a diminishing upside projection in each cycle, suggesting a potential limit to future growth.“The low to high from the 2011 to 2013 cycle was a staggering 560x,” Thielen notes. “Following a pattern of dividing each cycle by roughly 5, our analysis projected a high of $70,000 for the current cycle, which aligns well with what we’ve seen so far.”Also Read: Digital Currency Group Sees Revenue Rise Despite Grayscale StrugglesFocus on Trading The CyclesWhile questioning the $1.3 million target, 10x Research emphasizes the importance of understanding cyclical trends.“Bitcoin has historically experienced significant price drops between bull cycles,” Thielen states. “Investors should consider trading these cycles rather than simply holding (HODLing) their assets.”The Road Ahead: Consolidation And Potential RallyThe report predicts a potential consolidation period for Bitcoin in the near future, with prices settling around $52,000-$55,000. However, they see an opportunity for a rally later in the year.“Market excitement surrounding a potential Trump win in the upcoming US election could drive Bitcoin back to $70,000 or higher,” Thielen suggests. “A volatile market environment presents the best opportunity for investors to leverage our insights.”Looking Ahead: Benzinga’s Future Of Digital AssetsThe future of Bitcoin price predictions and market behavior will undoubtedly be a hot topic at upcoming industry events. Benzinga’s Future of Digital Assets conference, happening on Nov. 19, is one such platform where leading analysts and investors will gather to discuss the latest trends and strategies.Read Next: SEC Accusations Misworded?

Crypto And Politics: Cardano Founder Says Don’t Vote This Presidential Candidate | Bitcoinist.com


								With the US presidential elections fast-approaching, industries such as cryptocurrency have been drawn into the discussion as to what it could mean for their future. Cardano founder Charles Hoskinson has also shared his insights on the elections, particularly on the candidates, about what a victory for each candidate would mean for the crypto industry and its future.
Cardano Founder Does Not Want President Joe Biden
President Joe Biden is currently running for a second term after emerging victorious in the 2020 presidential elections. However, this time around, the 46th president of the United States is not seeing as much support as he did back then.

Cardano founder Charles Hoskinson points out the fact that the Biden administration has been particularly bad for the crypto industry. In a broadcast on X (formerly Twitter) on Thursday, he revealed his disapproval of how the Biden administration has approached the crypto industry, accusing the president of trying to hurt the industry with every chance he got.
Given this, the Cardano founder is vehemently against President Joe Biden taking office for a second term. According to Hoskinson, “A vote for Biden is a vote against the American cryptocurrency industry.”Hoskinson’s comments come in light of the White House releasing a statement that said the incumbent president plans to disapprove legislation that would allow the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to prevent banks from holding crypto. But it seems this has come a little too late for crypto stakeholders.
While the Cardano founder does not outright endorse Former President Donald Trump, Biden’s fiercest rival, he does admit that things were much better for crypto under his administration.” The [Trump] administration had its issues but mostly ignored our industry,” Hoskinson said. “The Biden administration has engaged in a coordinated effort to kill crypto.”
Donald Trump Goes To Bat For Crypto
While President Joe Biden continues to skirt around the issue of laying out support for crypto, opposition Donald Trump has been guns out with his support for crypto. Earlier this week, Trump declared his support of the crypto industry. The former president has called on all crypto supporters to vote for him, saying, “If you’re in favor of crypto, you better vote for Trump.”

Interestingly, Trump’s support for the crypto industry did not just begin. The presidential candidate has been involved in the industry for a number of years now, even launching multiple non-fungible tokens (NFTs) collections called the “Trump Digital Trading Cards.”
These NFT collections were well-received by crypto investors, generating over 15,000 ETH in volume from OpenSea alone, with almost 14,000 unique holders. Donald Trump also holds a significant amount of Ethereum (ETH) as well as other altcoins sent to his wallet by the community.

Exclusive: PlayShutdown CEO Talks on Q4 Launch, $FUSE Token Airdrop, and Game Design | Cryptopolitan

PlayShutdown is one of those games set in the “dystopian universe” theme but brings a whole new visual style to the popular gaming trope. At its core, Shutdown is an action-packed ARPG shooter built on the impressive Unreal Engine 5. But with its unique blend of features comes a wave of questions.In this interview, we got Houston Song, CEO of PlayShutdown, to answer some questions about the game and lift the lid on the game’s design choices, full release date, and potential airdrop of its upcoming $FUSE token. Hello Houston. I read you are an early investor in DOGE and ETH and have been in gaming for 8 years. How did it all start, and is Shutdown your first gaming project? Yes, Doge was actually my first crypto that I bought back in 2014. Back then, it was the meme of the year and it had just launched. I actually found it on Reddit where people were just trading it through threads.I switched over to Ethereum in 2015 because it was a more serious project, and I believed that the vision of having a programmable blockchain made sense.Playshutdown CEO, Houston SongI met my game developer and co-founder, Adam, in 2018, when we discussed gaming and crypto. We decided to combine the two, and that’s how the studio started.Our first title was actually a pretty ambitious FPS called Dissolution, but unfortunately, the technology at the time (Ethereum) didn’t have the scalability we needed.The project Shutdown started in 2022, once we already had a fair bit of experience working together on games.Can you walk us through the core gameplay loop in Shutdown? How will players spend most of their time, and what keeps them engaged?This game is an action role-playing game (ARPG) similar to Diablo or Path of Exile. Players aim to craft unique “builds” by combining items to achieve varying levels of power. The game concentrates on player versus environment (PvE) gameplay and a complex item economy. With random number generator (RnG) elements, the game introduces Web2 players to Web3 concepts in an engaging and accessible way.All of the items (weapons, armor, accessories, & equipment) in ShutDown start off as database items like in any other game. The player can upgrade them by using other items or components. Once these items get to the endgame, players are given the option to mint them as NFTs. In the process of minting them on-chain, they’re granted unique traits and abilities that can be combined with other items in the build to create some pretty badass combinations, which players will need to beat later stages in the game that are quite difficult.It’s this process of figuring out the best build for your character and growing stronger that makes ShutDown exciting and fun to play. Some might argue that the “dystopian universe” and “AI” themes are overused tropes in gaming. How would you counter that?It’s all about execution.Shutdown brings a unique visual style to the trope that sets us apart. I think the most important thing is gameplay – we’re all gun enthusiasts in our office, so we’ve spent quite a bit of time making sure the guns feel unique and satisfying to use.We’ve got a very talented team of folks that work on Shutdown – our Art director, Wesley, is a living encyclopedia when it comes to sci-fi games and movies, with work experience in Netease and Ubisoft.We’re also working with a super talented concept artist, Frank Yang, who helped lead the design direction on some big sci-fi IPs like the TV show “The Expanse.”Shutdown is built with Unreal Engine. Can you elaborate on the game design and qualities that players may find interesting? We wanted to make the combat feel super smooth, with impactful gunplay that makes you feel satisfied every time you pull the trigger. We wanted to give the Mongrel (the main character) the feeling of being a badass super soldier who can fight through hordes of enemies.Shutdown is big on customization, so you can tailor your abilities and build to fit any playstyle you want. This flexibility keeps the gameplay fresh each time you approach the game. One of the things that keeps the game interesting is the RNG elements, which means every game session will feel different. This can range from how enemies spawn to the type of loot that you might find.We take advantage of Unreal Engine’s support for Physically-Based Rendering, which makes the characters and world come to life with super realistic lighting and textures. Visually, we wanted to present a gruesome dystopian sci-fi world that is a departure from the vibrant IPs that are more common in Play-to-Earn games.Don’t you think the cross-play between platforms will give PC players with better hardware an inherent advantage over mobile users?Yes, PC players will have a slight advantage over mobile users. We’ve done our best to mitigate this by simplifying the controls. It is not a PvP-focused game, so I think it will still enhance the player experience, as PC players will be able to play with their friends who don’t have gaming rigs.It is a strategic decision we made at the start of development to reduce the barrier to entry for players who can play Shutdown. The AI threat in the game is very difficult, so you’ll want to have a couple of battle buddies to help you complete missions.Shutdown launched open-beta in Q1 2024 with 3,700+ weekly active users. Which regions or player types stand out the most from your user base?We were surprised by how many players there were in LATAM. That region is definitely going to be the next big wave of adoption in both web2 and web3 games.There was also a surprising number of competitive players, indicating that we have plenty of room to increase the game’s difficulty.When do you anticipate a full release of the game?We’re aiming for a public release in Q4 2024. The game is seasonal, so we plan to have content refreshes every 3-4 months. The mobile version of the game will launch in Q2 of 2025.The native token $FUSE is set to launch on major exchanges in early Q3 2024. Can you tell us more about the $FUSE launch? Will there be an airdrop for early users? I can’t reveal too many details about the $FUSE launch other than that it will be huge!There will be an airdrop for players who hold our NFTs and have posted scores. That’s all I can say!How does the web3 aspect integrate with gameplay?In the game “Shutdown,” Web3 integration plays a crucial role by enhancing gameplay and providing unique value through two main elements: Tokens and NFTs.Tokens as Premium Currency:Tokens in “Shutdown” serve as a premium currency. This means they’re used for special transactions within the game, such as purchasing exclusive items, accessing unique game areas, or upgrading characters and equipment. This premium status of tokens often encourages players to engage more deeply with the game to earn or acquire these tokens, driving both the gameplay and economic aspects of the game.NFTs as End-Game Items:NFTs (Non-Fungible Tokens) are used to represent the most powerful items in the game, essentially the end-game loot. These items are not just valuable because of their rarity or power within the game but also because they can be traded or sold outside the game, potentially for real-world value. This aspect adds a layer of investment and strategy to playing the game as players aim to acquire, use, and potentially profit from these high-value items.Minting NFTs:The process of minting NFTs in “Shutdown” is gamified, making it an engaging part of the gameplay rather than just a transaction. When players mint an NFT, the stats and abilities of the item are generated randomly. This introduces elements of surprise and chance, which can be thrilling for players. Each NFT item is unique, enhancing its value and the personal connection players might feel toward their in-game assets.By integrating these Web3 elements, “Shutdown” offers a gaming experience where the digital assets players earn or create have real value, both within and potentially outside the game world, adding layers of strategy, investment, and engagement to the traditional gaming experience.The P2E market has seen boom-and-bust cycles. How is Shutdown any different?Just like any Play-to-Earn game out there, “Shutdown” rides the same rollercoaster of market ups and downs and changes in player interest, especially in the short term.At its heart, “Shutdown” is built for folks who are into traditional gaming. We’ve borrowed the best parts of classic web2 games—the kind of stuff that keeps players hooked. By focusing on these proven gameplay elements, we’re really aiming for the long haul, not just a flash in the pan. This strategy helps us smooth out the wild swings that can happen in the P2E market by keeping our eyes on solid game mechanics rather than just the hype around the game’s tokens.When it comes to developing “Shutdown,” we’re sticking to the playbook of tried-and-true gaming business tactics. That means strong development processes, smart ways to bring in new players, and ways to make money that keep the lights on for the long term. All this stuff is key to keeping the game stable and growing even when the P2E scene gets shaky.The real kicker is how we’ve integrated the game’s token right into the gameplay. It’s not just there for show; players actually need it to get ahead in the game, making it a crucial part of the whole experience. This setup means the token isn’t just something to trade—it’s something that adds real value to the game, which keeps players coming back. By making sure the token is something players really want and can use, we’re building a game that stands on its own, powered by real demand from real gameplay.What is the long-term vision for Playshutdown?The long-term vision for Playshutdown is to develop it into a comprehensive IP or universe, where we plan to release a variety of games across different genres and platforms. This strategic expansion includes the development of an FPS game that is currently underway.A key component of our vision involves the integration of tokens and NFTs, which will serve a pivotal role across all titles within the Shutdown ecosystem. These digital assets are designed to have cross-game utility, allowing players to leverage their investments and interactions in one game across others within the Shutdown portfolio. This approach not only enhances the user experience by adding value and continuity to their interactions but also fosters a more interconnected and dynamic gaming environment under the Shutdown brand.Last question. What’s your outlook for Web3 gaming in the next five years?In the next five years, Web3 gaming is probably going to shake things up quite a bit. We’re looking at two main types of games emerging: ones that double down on the whole Play-to-Earn (P2E) thing and others that aim to make it easier for regular gamers to get into Web3 stuff.“Shutdown” is ahead of the game here, already figuring out how to blend traditional gaming with Web3 to attract players from the Web2 world. This approach is not just about using cool new tech but making it super smooth for players to jump in.Also, there’s going to be a big push to get new players from places like Latin America and Africa. These regions are like hidden gems, loaded with potential gamers who haven’t been tapped into much yet.As these new markets open up, making games that everyone can actually play—no matter where they are or what tech they have—will be key. This could really change the kind of games that are made in the future.Lastly, the money side of P2E games is going to get more attention from regulators, especially in places like South Korea, where they are on top of their game with tech laws. As the blend of gaming and finance gets tighter, we’ll probably see more rules coming in to keep things fair and safe.

Crypto Expert Reveals How To Find 'High-Risk High Reward' Meme Coins - Benzinga

Pseudonymous crypto researcher CryptoKoryo, in his latest YouTube video, offered valuable insights and strategies for traders looking to trade meme coins.What Happened: The researcher highlights the potential of meme coins with stories of individuals turning $1,000 into a million dollars within a month. However, the reality is often different with many traders buying a meme coin thinking they are early but they land up at zero.He cited the real example of someone who bought $600 worth of Pepe on the first day it was tradable, sold the same day for a $60 profit, but could have made $9 million if they had held on.He recommends having a combination of two approaches for playing the game well:
Meme coins tend to perform best during specific periods, such as Q1 2024 and Q2 2023.

Wave one: Riskiest but offers the highest potential rewards, early buyers positioned to make substantial gains. (Examples: Popcat, Grok, BOME)



Wave two: More challenging, as traders must determine whether a meme coin will continue its upward trajectory or fade away. (Examples: Dogwifhat (CRYPTO: WIF), Pepe PEPE/USD, Bonk BONK/USD)



Wave three: Least risky, as the meme coin is already established. Potential returns are lower compared to earlier waves. (Examples: Dogecoin (CRYPTO: DOGE), Shiba Inu SHIB/USD)
He cautions investors/traders of influencers and "shillers" who may have their agendas, but not to ignore them entirely, as they can provide valuable information.Also Read: DOGE Is The ‘BTC Of Memes’ And These Two Meme Coins Are The ETH And A ‘Must Have,’ Trader ToutsWhy It Matters: CryptoKoryo notes that trading meme coins requires discipline, patience and a long-term perspective. "Don’t try to become rich overnight," he advises. "Try to focus on longevity as a trader and just becoming a bit better every time with every coin trade."In his meme coin narrative X post, the expert highlighted that the number of meme coins is too high and rising at a rapid pace, increasing supply, unlike in 2021 when demand exceeded supply.He notes two strategies: a fully on-chain approach wherein risk/reward is great but the win rate is low. Alternatively, waiting for a narrative to take over Crypto Twitter, thus increasing the win rate but giving up some of the risk/reward ratio.Kroyo opts for a combination of both approaches, as few of the thousand meme coins will be profitable. Compared to meme coins in 2021, Koryo thinks “It’s more like high-risk low-reward for most."What’s Next: The influence of Bitcoin as an institutional asset class is expected to be thoroughly explored at Benzinga’s upcoming Future of Digital Assets event on Nov. 19.Read Next: VanEck Meme Coin Index With DOGE And SHIB Would ‘Outperform 99% Of People If You Left It Alone,’ Says TraderThis content was partially produced with the help of AI tools and was reviewed and published by Benzinga editors.Image: Shutterstock

                        Hip Hop is back with a bang in 2024, as industry legends Kendrick Lamar and Drake duke it out for the crown in an increasingly hostile rap battle – and Solana meme coin markets haven’t missed a beat, with new OVHoe (BBL DRIZZY) token skyrocketing.This article will provide an analysis of BBL DRIZZY’s current price trends in the Solana meme coin market and look to see whether an innovative new meme coin, DOGEVERSE, represents a more promising investment opportunity at this time.BBL DRIZZY undertook an exceptional rally as retail investors flocked to the meme value surrounding Drake’s tumultuous exchange with Kendrick – which has so far seen Drizzy branded as a sexual predator, ‘deadbeat’ Dad, master manipulator, and target for physical shootings.BBL DRIZZY Price Analysis: As OVHOE Consolidates For Second Rally Leg – Is This Other Token Next to Pump?
As price action attempts to consolidate down at lower support, BBL DRIZZY is currently trading at a market price of $0.000709 (representing a 24-hour change of -31%).This comes after OVHOE undertook an exceptional Solana meme coin launch at 20:00 UTC on May 9, in a listing that gained instant traction with the price exploding a whopping +13,500% in the first 4 hours.Hitting an all-time high at $0.0034, the following hours have seen a major retracement move grip the chart – with price action so far down -78%.However, with consolidation now risking a second re-test of lower support at $0.0074, OVHOE is in a make-or-break position which could see the token sink-or-swim.Yet, there remain tangible reasons to be optimistic about BBL DRIZZY price action, with OVHOE’s market cap still alluring retail investors enamored by the Kendrick Lamar – Drake beef at $70k.Indeed, despite not being officially affiliated with the duo, there is potential that the release of further diss tracks could lead to bullish action returning to the coin.Although, as ever with meme coins, that is pure speculation.Meanwhile, an emerging crypto presale has unlocked viral success, having raised over $13M in a matter of weeks and there is still time to get involvedDiscover DOGEVERSE: Could Presales Offer Better Meme Coin Play?
While SOL presents a market-leading opportunity, the most significant gains are often found in presale investments, which allow investors to get in early and potentially secure the majority of a project’s growth. Just imagine investing in BBL DRIZZY before it hit the market and skyrocketed 30,000%.One such opportunity in the SOL ecosystem is the DOGEVERSE presale – which has unlocked viral success over the last month to hit $13M raised in the ongoing presale.Aiming to be the first multi-chain incarnation of DOGE, DOGEVERSE is positioned to grow rapidly as market participants race to grab a piece of the pie.DOGEVERSE is still raising funds at the presale stage and will start preparing for exchange listings very soon.Buy DOGEVERSE Here

Consolation Payment to the Victim Who Sent 71 Million Dollars of Bitcoin (BTC) to the Hacker with His Own Hands! - Bitcoin Sistemi

The most talked about hacking incident of recent times took place last week. In this incident, an investor was attacked by a hacker while trying to send Bitcoin to his own address, and he sent WBTC worth $71 million to the hacker with his own hands.
As a week passed after the hack, the hacker relented and made a consolation payment to the person whose WBTC he stole.


According to Lookonchain's post, the hacker made a refund and has returned a total of 4,676 Ethereum-ETH (worth $14.2 million) piece by piece so far.
https://twitter.com/lookonchain/status/1788857898086637909?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1788857898086637909%7Ctwgr%5Ed0d14b65b3594b595aa2eaf 5f7f7c0dcd7dd5f18%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fu.today%2Fhacker-makes- rare-move-to-refund-stolen-71-million-in-crypto





What Happened?
One person lost 1,155 Wrapped Bitcoin (WBTC), worth over $71 million, due to a phishing attack known as 'address poisoning'.
This person initially sent 0.05 ETH to an account he created. This person, who had no problems with this transaction, later sent WBTC worth 71 million. However, he sent it to the address created by the hacker, not to his own wallet.


Because when this person sent ETH for trial purposes, his address became visible in the transaction history. The hacker who followed this person created a similar address by making the letters at the beginning and end the same.
This person, who fell into the hacker's trap, sent all his WBTC to an address very similar to his own.





If this person had fully checked the entire address, perhaps they would not have lost their Bitcoins.

Donald Trump's Crypto Endorsement Lauded By Industry Figures Who Vow To 'Support President Trump' - Benzinga

Former U.S. President Donald Trump‘s recent endorsement of cryptocurrency has received a wave of support from prominent figures within the crypto community, signaling a significant shift in the political discourse surrounding digital assets.What Happened: During an event at Mar-a-Lago, Trump addressed enthusiasts and buyers of his NFT collection, underscoring his support for the industry and contrasting his stance with President Joe Biden's perceived cautious approach.Ryan Selkis, Founder and CEO of Messari, expressed his unexpected support online after sharing the stage with Trump, tweeting, "President Trump spoke very highly about crypto and then…invited me and @MihailoBjelic on stage to say a few words. Fight for crypto. Support President Trump."This public affirmation from Selkis highlighted the importance of Trump's backing in the crypto community’s ongoing battle for recognition and regulation.Adding to the conversation, a crypto trader known as Satoshi Flipper claimed that the entire American crypto community’s backing could spell trouble for Biden and the Democrats, asserting that their alienation of crypto supporters might cost them dearly in the upcoming elections. Ram Ahluwalia, CEO of Lumida Wealth, further emphasized the potential for digital assets to feature prominently in national debates, suggesting a shift towards more substantive political engagement with cryptocurrency.Also Read: Digital Currency Group Sees Revenue Rise Despite Grayscale StrugglesThe dialogue around Trump's endorsement was further fueled by a tweet from Autism Capital, who credited Vivek Ramaswamy with influencing Trump's positive stance on crypto. The tweet argued that supporting Trump could be seen as a moral responsibility for those in the crypto industry, emphasizing the entertainment and potential benefits of his approach to crypto regulation.Trump’s endorsement came during an event celebrating his “Mugshot Edition” NFTs, where he proudly claimed, “We made NFTs hot again,” and criticized the current administration’s handling of the crypto industry. His remarks underscored a significant pivot from his previous criticisms of Bitcoin and digital assets, marking a notable change in his views on the economic potential of cryptocurrencies.This enthusiastic response from the crypto community underlines the growing significance of digital assets in political campaigns and the broader conversation on economic innovation. What’s Next: As the debate continues, Benzinga's upcoming Future of Digital Assets event is set to be a crucial forum for discussing the evolving relationship between cryptocurrency and mainstream politics, further highlighting the impact of Trump's new stance on the future political landscape.Read Next: SEC Accusations Misworded?

Bullish divergence: Crypto market with potential reversal ahead


The cryptocurrency market is heating up after nearly two months of a downtrend as bullish divergences surge as signals of a possible reversal. Finbold has gathered data on May 10, identifying these signals to help crypto investors navigate these times.
Notably, TradingView‘s total crypto market cap index is now valued at $2.19 trillion, testing a short-term uptrend support. Since April 12, the index has traded below the 30-day exponential moving average (30-EMA), creating resistance at $2.285 trillion. A breakout from this level could propel the market to this year’s highs at $2.72 trillion.
Moreover, its downtrend has been since March 14 but could soon be challenged by growing momentum. The daily relative strength index (RSI) signals this possible reversal by breaking out from its downtrend in a bullish divergence.

Bullish divergence: Retail stops buying, whales accumulate
Looking at social indicators on Santiment, the social volume and dominance of the word “buy” have dropped to yearly lows. Under the proper conditions, this momentary lack of interest is usually associated with bottom formations.

Santiment‘s leading analyst, Brian Q, has reached a similar conclusion regarding the crowd’s “buy the dip” chants.

Additionally, another bullish divergence lies in Bitcoin’s (BTC) significant drop in social volume, while the leading cryptocurrency’s whales hold record percentages of the supply. As of this writing, BTC is trading at $60,550, testing key support at a solid range low.

From a world’s regulatory perspective, optimism is surging in India as it reopened its doors to offshore cryptocurrency exchanges like Binance and Kucoin. Conversely, a regulatory crackdown in the United States has led to the withdrawal of popular Bitcoin wallets.
Despite the aforementioned signals, cryptocurrencies remain a highly volatile asset class. Thus, investors must remain cautious while navigating these turbulent waters, looking ahead for fundamental demand and capital inflow as organic signals for long-term price appreciation and sustainability.

Price analysis 5/10: BTC, ETH, BNB, SOL, XRP, TON, DOGE, ADA, AVAX, SHIB

Bitcoin (BTC) continues searching for direction as the bears and the bulls battle it out for supremacy. Glassnode founders Jan Happel and Yana Allemann believe the price will resolve to the upside. They said in a X post that they expect Bitcoin to “BLOW higher.” The uncertainty about the next directional move has not stopped purchases by the whales. Market intelligence firm Santiment said in a X post that whale wallets holding between 1,000 and 10,000 Bitcoin acquired roughly $941 million worth of Bitcoin in a 24-hour period.Crypto market data daily view. Source: Coin360Bitcoin’s long-term investors do not seem to be worried about the range-bound price action in the near term. In a recent interview with journalist Mike Solana, Twitter co-founder Jack Dorsey said that Bitcoin could skyrocket to at least $1 million by 2030 and even surpass the level from that point onward.Could buyers continue to defend the support levels in Bitcoin and altcoins, or will the bears prevail? Let’s analyze the charts of the top 10 cryptocurrencies to find out.Bitcoin price analysisBitcoin bulls are trying to keep the price above the psychological support at $60,000 but are facing selling at the 20-day exponential moving average ($62,959).BTC/USDT daily chart. Source: TradingViewThe downsloping moving averages and the relative strength index (RSI) in the negative territory suggest that the bears have the upper hand. If the $59,650 support cracks, the BTC/USDT pair may plummet to the 61.8% Fibonacci retracement level of $54,298.This negative view will be invalidated in the near term if the price turns up and breaks above the 50-day simple moving average ($65,620). The pair could then accelerate toward the critical overhead resistance of $73,777.Ether price analysisEther (ETH) has been trading between the 20-day EMA ($3,087) and the horizontal support at $2,850 for several days.ETH/USDT daily chart. Source: TradingViewThe downsloping moving averages and the RSI in the negative territory indicate advantage to sellers. A break and close below $2,850 will signal the resumption of the downtrend. The ETH/USDT pair may collapse to the channel’s support line.The zone between the 20-day EMA and the resistance line is likely to act as a critical resistance. Buyers will have to shove the price above this zone to suggest a potential trend change. The pair may climb to $3,350.BNB price analysisBNB (BNB) rebounded off the moving averages on May 8, but the move lacked momentum, indicating hesitation to continue buying at higher levels.BNB/USDT daily chart. Source: TradingViewIf buyers propel the price above the downtrend line, it will increase the likelihood of a rally to the overhead resistance of $635. This is an important level to watch out for because a break above it could open the doors for a rally to $692.Meanwhile, the bears are likely to have other plans. They will try to tug the price below the moving averages. If they do that, the BNB/USDT pair may slump to $536 and then to the solid support at $495.Solana price analysisSolana (SOL) fell below the 20-day EMA ($146) on May 8, but the bears could not sustain the lower levels.SOL/USDT daily chart. Source: TradingViewSolid buying by the bulls pushed the price back above the 20-day EMA on May 9, but the SOL/USDT pair could not reach the $162 resistance. The flattish 20-day EMA and the RSI near the midpoint do not give a clear advantage either to the bulls or the bears.If the price turns up from the current level and breaks above $162, it will suggest that the bulls are back in the game. The pair may rise to $185 and later to $205. The critical support zone to watch on the downside is between $126 and $116.XRP price analysisXRP (XRP) has been trading between $0.46 and $0.57 for the past few days, indicating a balance between supply and demand.XRP/USDT daily chart. Source: TradingViewThe price slipped below the 20-day EMA ($0.52) on May 7, indicating that the bears are trying to take charge.

A strong bounce off $0.46 could extend the stay inside the range for a while longer.The bulls will have to push and maintain the price above $0.57 to suggest that the correction could be coming to an end.Toncoin price analysisToncoin (TON) rebounded off the moving averages on May 8 and cleared the hurdle at the 61.8% Fibonacci retracement level of $6.49 on May 10, signaling that the correction may be over.TON/USDT daily chart.

The TON/USDT pair will attempt a rally to $7.67.Conversely, if the price turns down sharply from the current level or the overhead resistance at $7.67, it will suggest that bears remain active at higher levels. That could result in the formation of a range between $4.72 and $7.67.Dogecoin price analysisThe bulls are trying to prevent Dogecoin (DOGE) from retesting the neckline of the large head-and-shoulders pattern.DOGE/USDT daily chart. Source: TradingViewBuyers will have to push the price above the 20-day EMA ($0.15) to clear the path for a rally to the 50-day SMA ($0.17). This is an essential level for the bears to defend because a break above it could start a rally to $0.21.Instead, if the price turns down from the current level or the 50-day SMA, it will suggest that the DOGE/USDT pair may spend some more time inside the range. The trend is likely to turn bearish if the price skids below $0.12.Related: Telegram-linked Toncoin soars 50% in May for these 3 reasonsCardano price analysisCardano (ADA) remains stuck between the 20-day EMA ($0.47) and the support line, indicating uncertainty among the bulls and the bears about the next directional move.ADA/USDT daily chart.

Source: TradingViewIt is difficult to predict the direction of breakout from a triangle with certainty. Hence, it is better to wait for the price to escape the triangle before taking a directional view. If the price plunges below the triangle, it will signal that the bears have overpowered the bulls. The SHIB/USDT pair may then descend to the 78.6% Fibonacci retracement level of $0.000017.On the contrary, if the price turns up and breaks above the 20-day EMA, it will suggest buying at lower levels. The pair may rally to the resistance line of the triangle.This article does not contain investment advice or recommendations.

‘This One Is Going To Be a Banger’: Low-Cap Altcoin Flashing Bullish Signal, According to Top Crypto Analyst - The Daily Hodl


								A widely followed cryptocurrency analyst and trader is turning bullish on a decentralized wireless network project.
The analyst pseudonymously known as Bluntz tells his 258,700 followers on the social media platform X that key indicators suggest Helium (HNT) is about to have a massive breakout.










Bluntz uses the Elliott Wave theory in his analysis, which attempts to forecast price movements based on crowd psychology that is manifested in waves. The Elliott Wave theory suggests that price impulses happen in five waves after three-wave “ABC” corrections.
“Since original post we did a nice five wave rise from the lows and now a clear three wave ABC right into the 0.618 [Fibonacci retracement level] here with a strong reaction from it. This one is going to be a banger in my opinion, liking the structure a lot while $3.40 holds.”
Source: Bluntz/X
Helium is trading for $4.63 at time of writing, up slightly in the past 24 hours.
Next up, the analyst thinks that Bitcoin (BTC) is on the verge of breaking out to new all-time highs (ATHs).
“BTC likely going to be a solid engulfing on the daily close [May 9th]. Looking like the next push up into ATHs has started in my opinion.”
Source: Bluntz/X
Looking at his chart, he suggests that Bitcoin is on the verge of breaking out of a falling wedge pattern and could soar to $84,000.
Bitcoin is trading for $60,829 at time of writing, down nearly 2% in the last 24 hours.
Lastly, the analyst suggests that smart contract platform NEAR Protocol (NEAR) will soar to $11, a nearly 50% gain from the current value.
“NEAR still one of my favorite picks at the moment and one of strongest uptrends of top 20 coins since the April capitulation lows.”
Source: Bluntz/X
Looking at his chart, the analyst suggests NEAR is printing a bullish pattern of higher low prices.
NEAR is trading for $7.34 at time of writing, up 1.6% in the last 24 hours.

SHIB Burns Shoot Up 5,803% After Cryptic Whale’s Contribution - DailyCoin


        
Daily burns skyrocketed by 5,803% after an anonymous whale burned 24M SHIB.



Shiba Inu (SHIB) entered a new support cluster around $0.000023 this Friday.



A $7 million gap between latest bids and sales puts extra pressure on SHIB.
The Shiba Inu community, popularly known as SHIB Army, was taken by surprise this Friday, witnessing a massive 5,803% surge in daily SHIB burns. According to the blockchain’s burning records, one particular transaction stands out from the crowd with a colossal 24,176,493 SHIB tokens blazed at once.
Converting to $565 at stamped transaction time, the transfer raised eyebrows among SHIB community members, who have been patiently waiting for Shiba Inu’s auto-burning mechanism on Shibarium Layer-2. Besides the hefty transaction, SHIB community members have burnt 26,430,838 SHIB coins over the past 24 hours.Moreover, the abnormally huge increase in Shiba Inu burning falls in line with SHIB’s price movement, as the popular canine coin recouped 4% of the gains lost during the week. The altruistic SHIB burn deed has pushed SHIB above the $0.000023 support levels, marking $0.000025 as the next target for the canine crypto.Good Samaritan’s Wallet Unveils Huge SHIB StashUpon further investigation by DailyCoin, the linked crypto wallet to the 26M SHIB burn transfer still holds a whopping 166,893,009,838.85 SHIB tokens, worth $3,903,591 as of press time. Moreover, Shiba Inu is the largest meme currency held in the wallet, according to Nansen’s crypto portfolio tracker.While 46% of the whale’s crypto wallet consists of USD Coin (USDC), it’s fair to say that the burning deed and the bullish price movement that followed for Shiba Inu has significantly boosted the percentage of custodians making a profit at this price range. With 59% of holders in the money, the range between $0.000023 to $0.000025 presents SHIB with a 13.36T support cluster, spread across 45.59K crypto addresses.Cumulatively, Shiba Inu’s sales over the past 24 hours have outweighed the SHIB bids by $7 million, signaling additional selling pressure in this range. While the 24-hour SHIB asks have risen by 9%, purchases have dropped by 5.6% during the same time period. As of press time, the #12-seated Shiba Inu (SHIB) is exchanging hands at $0.00002338, according to CoinGecko.On the Flipside
Shibarium L2 underwent a hard fork earlier this month, with SHIB army members expecting to see an auto-burning mechanism built into the Layer-2 chain.



While the auto-burning system is still being tested, SHIB Army members on social media argue that manually burning SHIB won’t have a stable effect on price.
Why This MattersShiba Inu’s community has been gradually growing throughout the years. Reducing SHIB’s huge supply via community burns has bore fruit in several pumps in the past.

World's Central Banks Buy $24,000,000,000 in Gold in Three Months, Setting New Record: Report - The Daily Hodl


								Central banks are in the midst of a gold buying spree, according to new numbers from the World Gold Council (WGC).
The organization says central banks added $24 billion of gold, weighing 290 tonnes, to their coffers in the first quarter of this year.










That’s the strongest level of net demand for any quarter on record, using data that dates back to the year 2000.
The WGC says China, Turkey, India and Kazakhstan are driving much of the demand for the precious metal.
“Many have attributed central banks’ ongoing voracious appetite for gold as a key driver of its recent performance in the face of seemingly challenging conditions: namely, higher yields and US dollar strength. And despite the high bar set in the last two years, the voracious buying has continued into 2024 in the face of the renewed gold price rally…
Not only is the long-standing trend in central bank gold buying firmly intact, it also continues to be dominated by banks from emerging markets. Ten central banks reported increased gold reserves (of a tonne or more) during Q1, all of whom have been active over recent quarters.
Source: Metals Focus, Refinitiv GFMS, World Gold Council
The WGC says the previous quarterly record for net demand was set in Q4 of last year, weighing in at 286 tonnes.
The group says more data is needed to determine whether gold’s recent rise in price will have an impact on central bank purchases moving forward.
“While the recent price rally may have impacted trade execution, for those central banks that manage their gold reserves more actively, we do not expect it will derail any strategic gold accumulation plans they may have.”
Gold has moved from around $2,000 at the start of this year to $2,347 at time of publishing.

Subscribe now to Alpha Reports and up your game!Go to Alpha ReportsNow that Bitcoin ETF hype has died off, the price trajectory of the leading crypto asset is back in the hands of the Federal Reserve, a new analysis suggests.In a Friday report, European digital asset manager CoinShares said Bitcoin’s price movements again appear driven by the broader interest rate conversation.“A closer examination of the last 40 trading days reveals an increased alignment with the interest rate expectations for June,” wrote CoinShares Head of Research James Butterfill. “A similar trend was observed in 2023.”According to CME Fedwatch, the market appears certain that interest rates will stay flat in June, only potentially dropping in Q4 of this year.Core PCE inflation—the Fed’s preferred inflation metric that excludes food and fuel—has proven much more sticky than expected over the last several months, remaining flat at 2.8% in March. Conversely, GDP growth figures have proven underwhelming, recording 1.6% in Q1 2024, as compared to 3.4% in the prior quarter.Data also shows that growth in the manufacturing and services sectors are contracting and stalling respectively.Such metrics fuel fears of stagflation, raising expectations that the central bank will keep rates higher for longer. In response, CoinShares explains, Bitcoin’s price fell below $57,000 leading into the Fed's next meeting on May 1.While the central bank maintained its policy rate above 5.25%, however, it also announced a “dovish surprise” with plans to taper its quantitative tightening (QT). This would mean reducing its balance sheet by $25 billion per month, rather than its prior $60 billion rate, slowing the rate at which it contracts the economy’s dollar supply.Theoretically, that’s good for Bitcoin and other risk assets, which have previously thrived in easy-money macro environments. Bitcoin’s price recovered above $60,000 shortly after the Fed’s announcement.“Keeping front-end rates elevated while simultaneously tapering QT can be likened to both applying the brakes to a car and accelerating at the same time,” Butterfill wrote. The U.S. Treasury, he added, may be reaching its limit in paying off its short-duration debt, leaving a shift in the Fed’s QT strategy as the only remaining option.Butterfill expects the Fed to cut rates later this year in response to weaker economic data, with the cut likely being “late, but greater than expected.”“With Bitcoin’s fixed supply and high immutability, when the Fed eventually cuts rates, it is probable that this tumultuous situation will support Bitcoin prices,” he added.Edited by Ryan Ozawa.Stay on top of crypto news, get daily updates in your inbox.

Whale On The Move: $18 Million Ethereum Withdrawal Triggers DeFi Frenzy


								The Ethereum (ETH) market is buzzing with activity after a whale (an investor with significant holdings) made a splash by withdrawing a whopping $18 million worth of ETH from Binance, a leading cryptocurrency exchange.

This move, meticulously tracked by blockchain analysis platform Lookonchain, has sent a positive vibe through the crypto community, hinting at a potential Ethereum bull run fueled by innovative DeFi (decentralized finance) strategies.
Whale Makes Waves With DeFi Power Play
The whale’s activity wasn’t just a simple withdrawal. It showcased a cunning DeFi maneuver designed to supercharge their Ethereum holdings. After acquiring a hefty 10,750 ETH on Binance, the whale converted it all to stETH, a special token representing staked Ethereum that earns interest. This stETH then became the key to unlocking even greater opportunities.


Aave To The Rescue: Borrowing To Buy More
The whale’s next move involved Aave, a popular DeFi lending platform. By depositing their stETH on Aave, the whale essentially collateralized their holdings. This allowed them to borrow a staggering $29 million worth of stablecoins – cryptocurrencies pegged to a stable asset like the US dollar.
With this newly acquired capital, the whale went on a buying spree, scooping up even more ETH.

Total crypto market cap currently at $2.2 trillion. Chart: TradingView
Leveraging DeFi: A Double-Edged Sword
This strategy, known as leveraging, allows investors to amplify their gains (or losses) by using borrowed funds. In this case, the whale is essentially betting on the future price of Ethereum.
If the price goes up, they can sell their newly acquired ETH for a profit, easily repaying the loan and pocketing the difference. However, if the price dips, they risk getting liquidated – a forced sale of their assets to cover the loan.

Ethereum As A Financial Powerhouse
The recent events surrounding Ethereum transcend mere price movements. They highlight the growing importance of DeFi in the cryptocurrency landscape. Platforms like Aave are empowering investors with sophisticated financial tools, blurring the lines between traditional finance and the decentralized world.
This, coupled with the strategic moves by major players like the whale, positions Ethereum not just as a speculative asset, but as a potential powerhouse in the evolving financial ecosystem.
Analyst Chimes In: Bullish On Ethereum’s Future
Meanwhile, prominent crypto analyst Crypto Tony recently shared his bullish stance on the coin. He advised his followers to hold onto their ETH, targeting a price point of $2,700. This bullish sentiment aligns perfectly with the whale’s actions, suggesting a growing consensus on Ethereum’s potential for significant price appreciation.

Learning From The Whales: Investors Take Note
For regular investors, the actions of these whales offer valuable insights. By closely monitoring on-chain transactions and staying updated on expert analysis, investors can gain a better understanding of market trends and potential investment strategies.
While blindly following the whales isn’t recommended, their maneuvers can provide valuable clues about where the market might be headed.

Marathon Digital Ramps Up Mining Capacity - Is A Turnaround in the Making? - Marathon Digital Holdings (NASDAQ:MARA) - Benzinga

B. Riley Securities analyst Lucas Pipes maintained Marathon Digital Holdings Inc MARA with a Neutral and lowered the price target from $19 to $18.Marathon Digital Holdings reported a first-quarter miss after excluding gains on digital assets and other non-recurring items. Adjusted EBITDA, excluding these items, came in at $51.1 million on Pipes’ estimates below his prior estimate of $83.5 million and consensus of $77.1 million. The company underperformed on elevated power and operating costs compared to Pipes’ estimates, while revenue was also lower than he had anticipated. So long as fully loaded production costs are above BTC prices, Pipes noted that the equity will likely continue to underperform its BTC benchmark, especially when investors have the alternative of holding liquid ETFs. He updated his estimates for the second quarter and 2024 adjusted EBITDA from $83.5 million to $68.0 million and from $363.1 million to $758.3 million, respectively.Needham analyst John Todaro reiterated Marathon Digital Holdings with a Hold.MARA reported results after the close Thursday, missing on top-line and adjusted EBITDA ex-BTC gains, Todaro said. The miss was primarily due to outages at Ellendale, but management estimates that around 60%- 65% of site capacity is currently online. He said G&A also increased sequentially, but management expects cash G&A to stay nearly flat for the remainder of fiscal 2024.  Marathon Digital Holdings reported revenue of $165 million, compared to Needham’s estimates of $175 million. The company also reported adjusted EBITDA ex-BTC gains of $40 million, compared to Needham estimates of $66 million.MARA increased its target from a previous range of 35 EH/s—37 EH/s to 50 EH/s by the end of fiscal 2024 and expects hosting to be gone by the third quarter of fiscal 2024.The analyst liked the improved costs for the remainder of fiscal 2024 as the company becomes more vertically integrated, with 54% of sites owned and operated by MARA. He increased his revenue estimates to reflect the increased hash rate coming online in fiscal 2024, but he also increased total network hash estimates, which partially offset. MARA stock gained 76% in the last 12 months. Investors can gain exposure to the stock via Global X Blockchain ETF BKCH and IShares Trust IShares Blockchain And Tech ETF IBLC.Price Action: MARA shares traded lower by 8.55% at $17.97 at the last check Friday.Image: Eivind Pedersen from Pixabay

                        Render Network’s RNDR token experienced a major price increase after Apple featured its Octane 3D rendering software during a May 7 iPad presentation. Apple Vice President of Platform Architecture Tim Millet delivered the unexpected exposure, sparking interest among investors and contributing to RNDR’s upward momentum.Why did Apple’s Mention Impact RNDR Price?
Apple’s brief mention of Octane 3D, lasting only a few seconds within a four-minute keynote, highlighted Octane’s capabilities and its integration with Apple products.The association with a tech giant like Apple instilled confidence in investors, leading them to speculate on the potential growth and adoption of Render Network’s technology. As a result, RNDR’s price surged by 11% immediately following the presentation and continued to climb in the subsequent days.Since May 8, RNDR has seen an overall 40% increase, reaching $11.54 on May 10, according to CoinMarketCap data. The surge outperformed Bitcoin price by a big margin, which experienced a more modest 6.9% gain during the same period.RNDR’s price growth is not an isolated incident; it reflects a broader trend within the artificial intelligence (AI) sector. Other AI-related tokens, including The Graph, Fetch.ai (FET), and SingularityNET (AGIX), have also witnessed major gains since May 6. The collective rise suggests growing investor confidence in the potential of AI technologies.Nvidia’s Upcoming Earnings Report and Market Expectations
The influence of major technology companies like Apple extends beyond individual endorsements. Industry leaders, such as Nvidia, play a crucial role in the development and adoption of AI hardware and software, shaping the market for tokens like RNDR.Market analysts are closely monitoring Nvidia, as its Q1 2024 earnings report, expected on May 22, could greatly influence the trajectory of AI-related tokens, including RNDR. Positive earnings and optimistic forecasts from Nvidia could further fuel investor interest and potentially drive further growth in the AI sector.

Donald Bitcoin (DONBTC) to Explode 11,000% Ahead of MEXC Listing, as Shiba Inu, Bonk and Dogecoin Lag



                    

Early investors in memecoins like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Bonk (BONK) and Dogecoin (DOGE) made astronomical returns, and Donald Bitcoin (DONBTC) presents a similar opportunity for a limited time.



Donald Bitcoin (DONBTC), a newly launched Solana memecoin, is poised to explode over 11,000% in a matter of days, as former Shiba Inu (SHIB), Bonk (BONK) and Dogecoin (DOGE) investors pour funds into this new token.




DONBTC will be listed on MEXC, one of the largest centralized exchanges in the world, within a few days – and this is a massively bullish development for the token, as millions of new investors will easily be able to buy Donald Bitcoin.



Currently, Donald Bitcoin can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jupiter and Raydium, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days.



To buy DONBTC on these platforms, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Donald Bitcoin by entering its contract address – 7nErZV74Y8L7zz1thKUczBniWMnLc74gQMdzbWnhr95e – in the receiving field.




DONBTC currently has a market cap of just under $15,000, meaning it has huge upside potential.



Early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and Bonk (BONK) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price.



If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner.

Tether Fires Back at Deutsche Bank's Bleak Stablecoin Outlook - DailyCoin


        
A major bank report has cast doubt on stablecoins, claiming that most will fail.



The report has highlighted a lack of transparency and vulnerability to speculation as key weaknesses in stablecoins.



Tether has hit back, calling the report baseless and lacking evidence.
The world’s largest stablecoin, Tether (USDT), is embroiled in a war of words with Deutsche Bank after the German banking giant issued a scathing report questioning the long-term viability of stablecoins in general and scrutinizing Tether’s solvency.Will Stablecoins Become Unstable?Deutsche Bank’s research, published earlier this week, casts a dark cloud over the future of stablecoins, a type of cryptocurrency pegged to a fiat currency like the U.S. dollar. The report, based on a historical analysis of 334 currency pegs since 1800, concludes that only 14% have managed to survive. 
Projecting this trend onto stablecoins, the bank’s analysts warn of “turbulence and de-pegging events” that could plague the asset class. “While some may survive,” the report states, “most will likely fail, particularly due to the lack of transparency in stablecoin operations and vulnerability to speculative sentiment.”The report further throws shade at Tether’s dominance in the stablecoin market, raising concerns about its solvency and its role as the underlying asset in many cryptocurrency derivatives contracts. Deutsche Bank warns of a “Tether peso moment”, a scenario where Tether loses its peg to the dollar, that could trigger significant losses for leveraged traders and destabilize the entire crypto ecosystem.Consumers Share Deutsche Bank’s CautionThe bank’s skepticism extends beyond Tether. The report highlights the inherent challenges of maintaining a stable peg in a volatile market like cryptocurrency, suggesting that “we will likely see much more instability in the years to come.”
Consumer sentiment appears to align with Deutsche Bank’s cautious outlook. A survey conducted by the bank in March across several major economies revealed that only 18% of respondents expect stablecoins to thrive, while 42% anticipate their decline.Tether, unsurprisingly, is not taking these criticisms lying down. The company has slammed Deutsche Bank’s research, calling it “lacking in clarity and substantial evidence.” Tether argues that the report relies on “vague assertions” rather than a rigorous analysis and fails to provide concrete data to support its claims of impending doom for stablecoins.On the Flipside
New stablecoin designs that address peg maintenance and volatility concerns could emerge, potentially rendering Deutsche Bank’s analysis outdated.



Tether refutes Deutsche Bank’s claims, highlighting its own success in maintaining its peg for over 8 years.
Why This MattersIf Deutsche Bank’s predictions hold weight, the future of stablecoins, a cornerstone of the crypto market for facilitating trades and reducing volatility, could be in jeopardy. A potential collapse of stablecoins would trigger a domino effect, causing significant losses for leveraged traders, destabilizing derivative markets, and eroding confidence in the entire cryptocurrency ecosystem.Crypto giant Tether is taking on Google in the tech world with a new phone!  This article dives into Tether’s plan to release a decentralized smartphone:Tether’s “Pear Phone” to Battle Google as Tech Giant StrugglesCurious about Tether’s recent profit boom?

                         With crypto having pulled back sharply in recent trade following US economic data that has reignited fears about stagflation, and in wake of hawkish commentary from Fed policymakers, traders are looking for altcoins with strong bullish momentum that might be the best crypto to buy now.And strong performing altcoins are difficult to find in Friday’s bearish market.Bitcoin (BTC) dipped back to the low $61,000s on Friday from earlier highs near $64,000.The latest US economic data saw US consumer sentiment slump to six months lows while inflation expectations spiked.Later, Fed policymakers pondered whether financial conditions in the US are tight enough to deal with stubbornly high inflation.As per CME, the money market implied likelihood of no Fed rate cuts by September jumped to 39% from 31%.Bitcoin and crypto generally tends to perform better in an environment of easing/easier financial conditions.It thus unsurprising that hawkish remarks from Fed officials, and data to back up a more hawkish Fed stance have weighed on crypto on Friday.There remains a lot of uncertainty regarding when the Fed will start interest rate cuts.This, combined with subsiding Bitcoin ETF demand and the typical summer/post-halving market lull, suggests the Bitcoin price could remain subdued.Spot Bitcoin ETF flows have slowed to a trickle, suggesting Bitcoin likely isn’t the best crypto to buy now for quick gains. Source: The BlockFew would be surprised to see Bitcoin slide back under $60,000 and retest recent lows.Most likely, it will continue to trade within its recent $56,000-$70,000ish ranges in the coming months.Traders hunting for the best crypto to buy now for quick gains need to be very selective when choosing altcoins.Best Crypto to Buy NowToncoin (TON)Despite the market’s broader bearishness, Toncoin (TON) is trading with strong momentum.It was last up 7.5% in the past 24 hours above $6.70, as per CoinMarketCap.Since its early May lows at $4.60, TON has rallied close to 50%.Powering the pump is optimism regarding the launch of the Telegram-based GameFi token Not Coin (TON) on the TON blockchain.Others also cited optimism about the launch of USDT on the blockchain. TON could imminently retest April’s highs near $7.70.As the blockchain garners rapid adoption, its market cap could soon blast beyond its current $23 billion.Toncoin could be one of the best cryptos to buy now.Render (RNDR)Render (RNDR) is another token bucking the market trend amid its own bullish narrative.The cryptocurrency was last trading near $11, up a stunning 60% from earlier monthly lows.Render is pumping since its protocol OctaneX was featured in a recent Apple keynote.Render remains a leader in the AI DePIN space and its market cap could go a lot higher than its current $4.25 billion. That’s why it could be the best crypto to buy now.Crypto Alternative to Consider – Mega Dice (DICE)
The above-mentioned altcoins could easily post 5x gains this crypto bull cycle.However, investors looking for even greater upside potential should check out presale investing.Web3 projects frequently sell their tokens at a big discount to early investors as they raise funds for development.If presale investors can find a good project that gains traction in the market, they can book exponential gains.One project that analysts at Cryptonews are a big fan of is Mega Dice Casino.This already well-established crypto casino has launched a presale of its utility token, DICE.DICE holders get big cashback benefits on their wagers and can generate passive income via DICE staking.The crypto casino is also running a $750,000 airdrop to reward early presale investors.The project has already raised $880,000, too. Potential investors may want to move quickly, as the DICE price will rise when the $1 million milestone is hit.Mega Dice is also running a referral scheme.Check Out Mega Dice Casino’s Presale

The decentralization dilemma: Sacrifices to be made on the way to freedom | Cryptopolitan

Decentralization is a hot topic in digital assets, often seen as a key to the future of crypto. Everyone’s talking about it like it’s a magical solution, but let’s get real—it’s as tricky as chasing a pot of gold at the end of a rainbow.Unpacking the Decentralization DreamDecentralization takes cues from the tech world, where it’s all about setting up efficient networks. But now, we’re applying this to money matters. Take Ethereum, for example. Joseph Lubin, one of the brains behind it, didn’t just want to create a new type of money. He wanted to change how we trust financial markets. He says Ethereum is all about cutting out the middleman as it grows up.This whole idea is to kick to the curb the usual suspects—banks, exchanges—you name it, and let a big group handle things like making decisions and keeping records. This group isn’t controlled by anyone and operates on open-source networks. This setup means they shouldn’t need to trust each other too much because there’s less juice in trying to game the system.But here’s the kicker: when big fails like FTX and Mt Gox go down, it’s a slap-in-the-face reminder of what happens when you put all your eggs in one basket. These are the kind of messes crypto wants to clean up.Now, if decentralization means one side gets more power, it’s a safe bet someone else is losing out. This trade-off got the Securities and Exchange Commission all up in arms last week. They’re eyeing Lubin’s group, Consensys, maybe hitting them with an action because they think the Metamask wallet smells like a broker-dealer, which Lubin finds downright laughable.Lubin’s take? The U.S. government loves playing big boss with banks worldwide. But he’s all about dodging these middlemen, giving folks direct control over their assets, and sparking all sorts of financial and tech innovations. Meanwhile, the SEC is probably sweating over the potential flood of capital and innovation heading toward Lubin’s ecosystem, worried it’ll turn the whole scene on its head.The Reality Check on DecentralizationDive deeper, and you hit a wall of reality. Decentralization isn’t just a tech play; it’s a major governance headache. Candace Kelly from the Stellar Development Foundation breaks it down: a decentralized world has layers, lots of them, with different players managing different bits from ensuring protocols work to handling the wallets where your digital bucks live.Kelly compares it to the internet—no one owns it, and that’s cool. It’s all about the power of open, public networks that are constantly looked after, unlike those stuffy private networks where some bigwig still calls the shots.Yuval Rooz from Digital Asset throws in another curveball. Regulators would freak if JPMorgan threw open its doors and let the whole internet peek at their client’s info. He thinks the future’s about public infrastructure that everyone can tap into, but where creators still get to play by the rules and decide what they’re putting out there.This blend of openness and regulation is starting to look a lot like those global financial markets trading in bonds or swaps, where deals aren’t hammered out on public exchanges but are still tied up with regulatory strings. These markets have been around forever without needing blockchain tech.Here’s the takeaway:- Crypto is going through growing pains, learning stuff the hard finance world already knows by heart. You can’t slap a “decentralized” label on everything. It’s tougher to spread governance than technology. And while dropping something on a blockchain is cool and all, it doesn’t magically make it decentralized. Just like the internet shows us, you can have decentralized services without needing a blockchain at all.So, what’s the endgame? Decentralization is more of a balancing act than a finish line. Some things will lean towards centralization, others won’t. But what’s clear is getting there is about making smart choices, not just chasing dreams.

Is Altcoin Season 'A Myth'? Researcher Sheds Light On Why 'The Days Of Easy Mode Are Over' - Benzinga

Crypto researcher Distilled Crypto challenged the notion of an "Altcoin Season" and explored the factors contributing to the lackluster performance of altcoins despite Bitcoin’s BTC/USD solid performance.What Happened: Distilled Crypto notes that while Bitcoin has reached $60,000, sentiment remains abysmal, and the anticipated altcoin season of 2021 has yet to materialize. He delves into the key differences in this cycle, highlighting Ethereum’s ETH/USD lag and the premature surge of other altcoin sectors. "While some sectors excel, there’s no widespread surge," the trader observes.Accessibility to Bitcoin has improved significantly, with ETFs and traditional brokers offering exposure without the need for complex wallet management. He argues that lack of awareness is not the primary issue hindering altcoin growth. "Bitcoin has been around for over 15 years and has seen many cycles,” he notes. “Its financial story, though solid, no longer grabs attention."Instead, Distilled Crypto attributes the altcoin market’s struggles to a supply and demand issue, stating, "The market lacks sufficient liquidity and retail interest. Demand for altcoins is very low, yet there’s an abundance of choices." The rapid increase in altcoins has diluted an already saturated market, making a widespread altcoin boom exceptionally difficult.Despite these challenges, Distilled Crypto believes that altcoins are not a lost cause but emphasizes that the game has changed. "The days of an ‘easy mode’ are over," he asserts. "If you can’t trade attention, you’ll likely get wrecked."For those not inclined to trade, Distilled Crypto suggests focusing on deep research and cherry-picking multi-cycle winners in institutionalized sectors and next-generation primitives.Also Read: With Altcoins At First Ever ‘Weekly Golden Cross’, This Prominent Trader Remains ‘Heavily Allocated’Why It Matters: Looking ahead, Distilled Crypto anticipates that attention and liquidity will continue to dominate the market in the short term. However, as regulations tighten and the altcoin market becomes oversaturated, a strategy focused on fundamentals could prevail. "Just be prepared—it might take longer than expected," the researcher cautions.Distilled Crypto’s analysis echoes the sentiments of another crypto researcher, Gideon, who warned earlier in May 2024 that retail investors are unlikely to drive the ongoing bull run. He pointed out that Bitcoin broke new all-time highs with the buying power of ETFs, not retail investors, and that retail interest and savings are currently low.What’s Next: The influence of Bitcoin as an institutional asset class is expected to be thoroughly explored at Benzinga’s upcoming Future of Digital Assets event on Nov. 19.Read Next: Is It Time For Altcoins To Shine?

The Most Important Developments in the Ripple v. SEC Trial: Two Week Recap


																TL;DR

The legal confrontation between Ripple and the SEC intensifies, with recent filings focusing on whether a key witness’s declaration is standard evidence or unsolicited expert testimony.
As both parties await a judicial ruling, speculations arise about a potential settlement this summer.


The SEC’s Actions
The legal case between Ripple and the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), which dates back to December 2020, has intensified in the past several weeks. One important reason for the numerous actions from both sides is the start of the trial process on April 23.
Shortly after that date, Judge Sarah Netburn entered a new scheduling order focused on the motion for remedies and entry of final judgment. 
On April 29, the regulator abided by the rules by filing its opposition to Ripple’s motion to strike new expert materials. The endeavor was centered on testimony from the key witness, Andrea Fox (known as the “Fox Declaration”).
Ripple previously argued that the declaration represents an unsolicited expert opinion, whereas the SEC described the process as “standard summary evidence in support of calculations for disgorgement.” 




“It’s not an expert report, does not rely on specialized experience, and does not render any opinions at all, let alone an “expert” one. Nor does it present the testimony of a percipient witness. Rather, it applies basic arithmetic to Ripple’s financial records to streamline the presentation of the evidence to Judge Torres… The court should deny Ripple’s motion,” the agency insisted. 
In addition, the Commission claimed that the “Fox Declaration” consists of data derived from documents generated by Ripple itself, including tax returns and financial statements, which can be useful for determining the lawsuit’s outcome.
Ripple Strikes Back
A few days later, the company filed a letter in further support of its initial request. It stated that the watchdog failed to show that the declaration is summary evidence rather than expert testimony:
“Fox is an expert because she purports to use technical or other specialized knowledge to help the trier of fact to understand the evidence or to determine a fact in issue. She does not merely apply basic arithmetic to Ripple’s financial records, as the SEC contends.”
Ripple went further, suggesting that even if Andrea Fox could be categorized as a summary witness, the Commission failed to disclose her before the end of the discovery process.
Other Developments and a Possible Settlement
Earlier this week, the SEC filed its remedies reply brief and supporting exhibits under seal. The redacted and public version of the information was presented a day later. 
According to American lawyer Jeremy Hogan, this action marked the end of the briefs phase. He claimed the regulator “went out with a whimper here,” adding that the legal battle has entered a stage with fewer developments, and both parties must wait for the judge’s ruling.
Hogan previously predicted that the lawsuit may officially be closed this summer following a $100 million settlement. This is far less than the $2 billion penalty sought by the SEC and much more than the $10 million Ripple agreed to pay.

Optimism surges as India reopens doors to offshore crypto exchanges


In a notable shift within its financial regulatory framework, India has reopened its doors to offshore cryptocurrency exchanges, with Binance and KuCoin leading the way to secure approvals from India’s Financial Intelligence Unit (FIU-IND). This development is poised to significantly alter the landscape for cryptocurrencies in India.
After a challenging period marked by bans due to alleged non-compliance with local laws, these major exchanges have now successfully navigated the regulatory hurdles, signaling a fresh start in a market valued at over $260 billion.
Binance and KuCoin’s re-entry into the Indian market comes after months of rigorous scrutiny and adjustments to meet the demands of Indian regulators. KuCoin has taken proactive steps by settling a $41,000 penalty, which has facilitated a swift resumption of its services. 


Binance, while currently registered, is still in the process of finalizing its compliance procedures, according to the sources.
Crypto context in India
These efforts reflect a broader trend of increasing regulatory oversight within India’s cryptocurrency sector. The FIU has registered a total of 48 crypto firms under the Prevention of Money Laundering Act, enhancing the legal framework governing digital assets in India. 
This includes a historic meeting with all registered entities, aimed at reinforcing compliance and cooperation between the crypto industry and regulatory bodies.
The backdrop to these developments includes a January ban on nine major offshore cryptocurrency platforms, such as Binance and KuCoin, which were blocked from operating in India due to compliance failures. 
Subsequently, their applications were removed from major app stores, significantly restricting access for Indian users. While some platforms, like Bitstamp and OKX, have ceased operations in India, others, including Gate.io and Kraken, are still negotiating their status with the FIU.
The future of crypto in India
The reopening of India’s market to these platforms is timely, as a recent report by Chainalysis ranks the Indian crypto market as the world’s second-largest, with an inflow of $260 billion in cryptocurrencies from July 2022 to June 2023. This robust market potential , coupled with renewed regulatory clarity , could set the stage for a thriving crypto economy in India.
The FIU’s willingness to engage in open dialogue and adapt regulatory measures reflects a forward-thinking approach to cryptocurrency regulation in India. This could potentially lead to increased investments and foster innovation in the sector, supporting growth in one of the world’s most vibrant digital asset markets.

Wells Fargo reports exposure to Grayscale and ProShares Bitcoin ETFs

Major United States-based financial services firm Wells Fargo has disclosed investments in Bitcoin (BTC) exchange-traded funds offered by Grayscale and ProShares.In a May 10 filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, Wells Fargo reported it held 37 shares of the ProShares Bitcoin Strategy ETF, which offers exposure to BTC futures, and 2,245 shares of Grayscale Bitcoin Trust, which was converted to an ETF. The firm also reported 52 shares in Bitcoin Depot, a crypto ATM provider.The total value of the three Bitcoin-related investments was $143,111, a significantly small holding for the major bank. Wells Fargo reported roughly $1.7 trillion in assets as of June 2023, making it the third-largest bank in the U.S. by holdings. The SEC added that observers should not assume that the information provided by the financial firm was “accurate and complete.”This is a developing story, and further information will be added as it becomes available.

Key Challenges in Securing Ethereum ETF Approval


The journey toward approving Ethereum (ETH) exchange-traded funds (ETFs) faces considerable hurdles despite its promise for the crypto market. 
The US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has shown a cautious approach, mirroring Bitcoin ETFs’ pathway before their eventual approval. Bundeep Singh Rangar, Founder and CEO of Fineqia, in an interview with BeInCrypto, highlighted the significant implications and challenges associated with Ethereum ETFs.
The Market Impact of an Ethereum ETF Approval 
The approval of Ethereum ETFs is expected to mirror the impact of Bitcoin ETFs, enhancing accessibility and legitimacy. 

“The introduction of Ethereum ETFs would enhance accessibility and legitimacy, attracting new investors seeking exposure to Ethereum without direct ownership,” Rangar noted. 

This could drive Ethereum’s price appreciation through increased demand and institutional participation. Moreover, Ethereum ETFs could boost adoption among traditional investors and integrate cryptocurrencies into mainstream portfolios, fostering broader market acceptance.

However, the SEC’s cautious approach reflects the regulatory challenges in the crypto market. 
Recently, the SEC delayed BlackRock’s application for an Ethereum ETF, seeking public input on concerns about fraud and manipulation. The regulatory agency has also questioned Ethereum’s classification following the transition to a Proof-of-Stake (PoS) consensus mechanism, which it argues could meet the Howey Test criteria for security.

“This approach reflects the SEC’s commitment to investor protection and market integrity, highlighting the need for robust safeguards against risks inherent in cryptocurrency markets,” Rangar remarked.


Critical factors influencing the SEC’s decision include addressing market manipulation, fraud, and investor protection concerns. The SEC’s deliberation signals a maturing regulatory environment for cryptocurrencies, balancing innovation with prudent oversight to mitigate potential risks. 
The Likelihood of Such an Approval Seems Slim
The successful launch of Bitcoin ETFs sets a positive precedent, yet ongoing concerns about market integrity remain a significant hurdle. Given Ethereum’s distinct characteristics, such as its consensus mechanism allowing for staking rewards, additional challenges must be addressed before receiving the SEC’s approval.


“The likelihood of approval hinges on demonstrating effective measures to mitigate these risks while showcasing market maturity and transparency,” Rangar explained. 

Still, market participants do not anticipate the approval of Ethereum ETFs in May. For instance, Bloomberg senior ETF analyst Eric Balchunas believes there is only a 25% chance that the SEC will approve this new financial product. Meanwhile, a wager on the decentralized betting platform Polymarket stands at just 9%.

These projections reflect the important considerations of Ethereum’s potential classification as a security. They further question many other digital assets utilizing PoS as their consensus mechanism. 

Interestingly, a Consensys spokesperson told BeInCrypto PoS does not affect Ethereum’s operations or non-security classification.


“If you look at director Hinman’s speech in 2018 when he said that Ethereum was not a security, he didn’t base that on PoW or PoS. The consensus mechanism is irrelevant,” the Consensys spokesperson said.

While Bitcoin’s consensus mechanism is nearly unique, the approval of spot Ethereum ETFs could pave the way for numerous other cryptocurrencies to be utilized as underlying assets in new financial products. Still, it is the SEC who will have the last word on this matter.

The Most Bizarre Moments In Crypto - The Defiant

There have been some oddball moments in our industry.The state of memecoins right now is: You log on to Twitter and see a teenager livestreaming his mother seductively dancing in front of the camera to pump a token dubbed $LIVEMOM.That happened not even a week ago. But that’s far from all.The term “meme” was coined by evolutionary biologist Richard Dawkins to define a unit of culture. Memecoins, in some ways, are the pinnacle of the concept, as they’re a unit of internet culture you can also own and trade.And with the arrival of platforms like pump.fun, anybody can push out these tokens in minutes. Combine the already irreverent nature of memes with the ability to permissionlessly create meme-related tokens, and pretty bizarre moments will inevitably follow.Here are some of the top crazy moments in memecoins.Doge Community Installs Dog StatueWho let the doge out?Fans of OG memecoin, Dogecoin, took their enthusiasm for the Kabosu dog to the next level and worked with authorities in Japan to erect a monument in tribute to their community’s canine idol.Located in the city of Sakura, Japan, the tribute shows a Kabosu dog lying on a sofa with its paws crossed, much like the Dogecoin image, accompanied by a trio of cats–likely a tribute to cat culture, which also pervades the digital world.Doge MonumentThe monument came to “furrition” last year on Nov. 2, when fans celebrated Doge’s birthday.DOGE Takes Over TwitterDoge, which was launched in 2013, has become a staple of the irreverence of the crypto community, gaining traction when renowned internet troll and billionaire Elon Musk began spreading the dog-inspired gospel.In an absurd yet entertaining turn of events, Musk purchased Twitter–renaming it to X–and briefly changed the classic blue bird logo to one depicting Doge. At one point, Musk’s Twitter bio said he was the former Dogecoin CEO.Musk has caught flak over his unwavering support of Doge, and he was sued in a class-action lawsuit for market manipulation – Musk’s tweets have pushed the price of Doge up more than once.Doge is now the 10-largest cryptocurrency with a market capitalization of $21 billion.Definitely not a number to bark at.Boden And PoliticiansWashington, D.C.’s political class has not been spared by Solana memecoin creators.And with 2024 being an election year, it seems political memecoins are in for a wild ride.One token that has far exceeded anybody’s expectations is Jeo Boden – a parody of the sitting U.S. President, Joe Biden."Boden the 46th pres of soluna. His jeb is te mäk three hundred trillion million billion dollars,” developers wrote on the token’s official website after its March 9 launch.Screenshot of BODEN websiteBoden has seen wild success. It briefly surpassed the $1 mark, although it has since dropped 70% to $0.30. The token’s market cap is still a whopping $212 million, down from its peak of $665 million.But Boden is only one of a plethora of politically charged tokens.One of the staunchest crypto adversaries, Senator Elizabeth Warren, saw her token launch under the ticker “Whoren,” as did famed political commentator Tucker Carlson with “tooker kurlson.” Former White House resident Donald Trump was also thrown into the mix with “doland tremp.”Other famous figures also got the memecoin treatment. “Olen Mosk” was spawned, as was “Drek” in a tip of the hat to musician Drake, and Mona – a meme rendering of the Mona Lisa.The list is endless.No Hands Rug PullThe most recent rug pull is straight out of a David Copperfield show.A man created a token called “No Hands No Rug” with the ticker $HANDS. He posed on camera with a sign under his chin that read, “I have no hands, I can’t do a rug pull.”'No Hands' Rug PullBut when the token peaked, he pulled his hands out from behind his back and sold 67 million HANDS for 7 SOL, pocketing $1,050.Most thought he had no hands, but in reality, he was packing one big ace up his sleeve.Degens Bet On Animal RacingAs the summer doldrums waged on, bored traders resorted to betting on animal races towards the end of July 2023.The most famous pastime for degenerate crypto gamblers was HamstersGG, where users could bet on the outcome of pre-recorded races between unfortunate rodents. Thousands of players took part in a game in which the winners split 95% of the wagered funds, with HamstersGG taking a 5% cut.As expected, degen crypto punters were inspired to create an entire category of animal racing tokens on CoinGecko. These included the Rabbits Club, Snails Race, and Rat Roulette, although at the time, HamstersGG – which was purportedly a rug pull – accounted for 85% of the sector’s market cap.Some were fast, while others were “wheel-y” slow.LIVEMOMHere’s a twisted take on some mother-son bonding.A teenager and his scantily-clad mother begged viewers on a livestream to buy their memecoin called LIVEMOM as she suggestively showed off her figure.Mother and child urged viewers to “run up” their token, promising degrading and perverted activities at different market cap milestones. These included eating dog food if the market cap reached $200,000 or the boy pouring milk on his mother’s breasts if it reached half a million.LIVEMOMThe top gag was shaving the boy’s head if degen traders pushed LIVEMOM’s market cap to $2 million market cap.However, the pair abruptly terminated the live stream, and the token subsequently crashed.Only two days after the LIVEMOM livestream, several copycats popped up, including LIVESIS.But this took it a step further than LIVEMOM.LIVESISAs the token tagged $100,000, the brother took his alleged sister’s bra off, played the crypto-classic tune, “Pump It Up,” and proceeded to dump his entire bag on screen.It all stays in the family, right?Racist Memecoins Darken The MoodMemecoin mania was well underway when some less savory tokens surfaced.Some of these included derogatory terms and symbols based on race and religion, as well as other hateful language, forcing the platform DEX Screener, a real-time DeFi token analytics platform, to review its token profile moderation policy.Racist tokens underscore a peculiar situation in the crypto ecosystem. On one hand, they shine a light on a dark underbelly, with people interested in creating and buying these types of tokens. Meanwhile, they show the permissionless nature of open blockchains and the fact that the technology enables the freedom to create anything a developer or user wants – for good or bad.DogWifHat Goes To VegasDogWifHat might be the darling memecoin of this cycle, characterized by a cute dog in an orange beanie.Its community is diehard. Fans raised a whopping $690,000 to put the meme on the famous Las Vegas sphere, a feat that still hasn’t come to fruition, however.DogWifHatBut it remains among the top 50 largest cryptocurrencies with a market cap of $3.5 billion — not bad for a token that didn’t exist a year ago and whose only utility is being meme-ably cute!Just more proof of the staying power of memes in crypto culture.Non-Memecoin BonusBizarre moments in crypto are not reserved for the memecoin sector. We have compiled a few of them here.J.K. Rowling Gets The Muggle Guide To BitcoinWingardium Bitcoinosa!Famed Harry Potter author J.K. Rowling caught the brunt of bitcoiners’ wrath in May 2020 when she posted on X, “I don’t understand Bitcoin. Please explain it to me.”Tweet from J.K. RowlingBig mistake.As expected, Bitcoiners descended on her like Voldemort’s Death Eaters, berating Rowling for not understanding it straight away.It wasn’t all bad, though.The account Bitcoin posted “Wizards still need to trust Gringotts Bank [in reference to the goblin-run financial institution that holds most of the wizarding world’s gold]. Bitcoin fixes this.”Other Bitcoiners got creative and created the “Muggle’s Guide to Bitcoin” in reference to non-wizarding people (dubbed muggles in the book series), weaving the wizarding world with Nakamoto’s creation.But the flood of responses became too overwhelming, and the author decided to drop out of the conversation with: “This started as a joke, but now I’m afraid I’ll never be able to log in to Twitter again without someone getting angry I don’t own Bitcoin. One day, you’ll see a wizened old woman in the street, trying to trade a Harry Potter book for a potato. Be kind. She did try to understand.”SBF Takes The Rich and Famous For a RideOne of Sam Bankman-Fried’s claims to fame is how he managed to entice celebrities far and wide.FTX imploded in late 2022, bringing the industry to its knees. But one overlooked scar that SBF left was on Hollywood movie stars, NBA athletes, and top-tier comedians.Just to name a few: Brazilian model Giselle Bündchen and her now ex-husband Tom Brady; actor Matt Damon; Golden State Warriors basketball player Steph Curry; and rappers Lil Yachty, Soulja Boy, Akon, Ne-Yo, and others are now associated with the failed exchange.One of the top moments was Larry David’s 2022 FTX commercial. The famed comedian and co-creator of the Seinfeld sitcom dressed up as several historical figures and criticized notable inventions in history.These included the wheel, lightbulb, dishwasher, moon landing, and FTX, and he claimed he was never wrong about them.It seems, however, he was very right on one of them.Comedians Roast Tom BradyEverybody knows that 7-time Super Bowl winner Tom Brady lost millions in the FTX collapse.Brady was reminded of his financial misfortune during a Netflix roast on May 5. The super athlete was burned by Kevin Hart and Nikki Glaser, among others.Kevin Hart opened the show with some friendly fire, asking, “Why didn’t we go to the Crypto.com Arena downtown? Well, the reason why we didn’t go there is because we didn’t want to remind Tom’s fans of how much money he owes them.”His comedic counterpart Nikki Glaser was up next and she didn’t hold back either, although Glaser took a larger shot at his teammate, and tight end Rob Gronkowski.“Tom also lost $30 million dollars in crypto,” she opened, asking, “Tom, how did you fall for that?” But her next punchline was a headshot to Gronk, when she said in a Tarzan accent imitating the tight end, “Me know that not real money.”Brady didn’t need to throw an interception for this to be a massive turnover.What’s Next, Degens?Irreverence is a feature, not a bug, in crypto.Degens take the time to troll, create a token about it, speculate, and set it free on the internet. They don’t spare politicians, famed authors, or cute furry animals.And the memecoin sector’s market capitalization proves it. It boasts a $53 billion market cap, and some of its top tokens – such as Dogecoin or Shiba Inu – land in the CoinGecko top 15.The proliferation of memecoins is set to continue, along with some of the absurd situations we have seen. When permissionless technology meets the internet culture, anything can happen.

$267,000,000,000 Bank To Abolish Cash, Warns Customers To Prepare for Massive Digital Overhaul - The Daily Hodl


								One of the largest banks in Australia is rolling out a plan to terminate cash and checking services.
In an update on its website, Macquarie Bank, which has $267 billion in assets, tells customers that a digital-centered banking experience will begin in November.










“In case you missed it, we’re phasing out our cash and cheque services for all products. To prepare for this change, you’ll need to start transacting digitally – a safe, quick, and more convenient way to bank. We’re removing our cash and cheque facilities in a phased approach.”
The bank says customers will no longer be able to access a list of over-the-counter services at Macquaries’ physical locations, nor deposit or collect checks or order new checkbooks.
“From Friday 1 November 2024
You won’t be able to:

write or deposit personal cheques
deposit or request bank cheques
deposit cash or cheques over the counter at NAB branches
make a super contribution or payment via cheque.

Please note any cheques received after Thursday 31 October 2024 will be returned to the sender.”
Once the changes are rolled out, Macquarie customers will only be able to access paper money using ATMs, with withdrawals capped at $2,000 AUD per day.
The move comes amid a broader shift away from cash across the country.
A total of 424 bank branches representing 11% of all banks in Australia were closed from June 2022 and June 2023, according to the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority (APRA)
At the same time, banks removed access to 718 ATMs.
Australians held a rally on April 2nd to protest the widespread closures and bring attention to the country’s move away from cash.

Ethereum transaction fees hit record low as Layer-2 networks siphon activity

The average transaction fee on Ethereum has reached record lows as more activity moves to the Layer-2 (L2) networks on the chain.According to Ultrasound.money data, the average gas has dropped to 4.81 Gwei — the lowest level since the network completed the Merge event in 2022.Market observers attributed this decline to increasing activity on L2 networks following the completion of the Dencun upgrade. The Dencun upgrade significantly reduced fees for L2 networks, making transacting on the base layer less attractive.Notably, the blockchain analytical platform IntoTheBlock reported:“An increasing number of transactions are now being settled on Ethereum Layer 2s. Last month, the three largest L2s hit a record 82% transaction share of all Ethereum transactions.”Ethereum Layer-2 Transaction Share. (Source: IntoTheBlock)Furthermore, the number of transactions on Arbitrum has seen strong growth, reaching over 2 million daily transactions on May 8 — a significant rise from the early March average of 1 million.L2beats data further indicates that Base and Arbitrum averaged 30 and 20 transactions per second, respectively, while Ethereum managed 13 transactions per second during the same period.ETH turns inflationaryMeanwhile, CryptoQuant analysis revealed that ETH has transitioned to an inflationary state post the Dencun upgrade, resulting in diminished gas fees and reducing its burn rate.In light of this development, the firm noted:“Since The Merge, Ethereum appeared to be on track with its ‘ultra-sound’ money narrative, showing a slight reduction in the total ETH supply. However, the post-Dencun upgrade challenges this by reducing transaction fees and the ETH burn rate, leading to an increase in supply.”Chart Showing Ethereum Ultra Sound Money Before and After Dencun Upgrade (Source: CryptoQuant)CryptoQuant further elaborated that the Dencun upgrade environment has presented a scenario where maintaining deflation would require a substantial increase in network activity, contrasting the current trend of low gas fees and reduced burn rates.Notably, UltraSound.Money data shows that the daily amount of ETH burned during the past day was 519 ETH, a record low for the network.

Monero's weekly hike - Mapping if LocalMonero's closure can stop its rally - AMBCrypto



Demand for XMR has spiked over the last few days
This happened despite the proposed plan to shut down LocalMonero

Monero’s native coin XMR appears poised to extend its seven-day rally, despite the negative sentiments around the closure of LocalMonero, a peer-to-peer (P2P) trading platform for the privacy coin.
On 7 May, LocalMonero announced that it has disabled all new sign-ups and advertisement postings for XMR on its platform. It added that on 14 May, it would disable new XMR trades, and by 7 November, its website would be taken down.
XMR looks the other way
At press time, the popular privacy coin was valued at $132.52, rallying by 8% in the last 7 days, according to CoinMarketCap. This, despite the fact that the broader market has remained largely circumspect over the past. 
An assessment of its price performance on the daily chart confirmed the possibility of an extended rally in the short term. For instance, at press time, the altcoin’s price lay above its 20-day small moving average (SMA). An asset’s 20-day SMA is a short-term moving average that reflects its average closing price over the past 20 days. 
When it is positioned below an asset’s price, it suggests that the short-term trend for the asset is upward. This is often viewed as a sign that buyers are in control of the market and that a sustained rally is possible. 
An asset’s 20-day SMA is a short-term moving average that reacts quickly to price changes. It reflects the average closing price of an asset over the past 20 days.

Furthermore, XMR’s rising momentum indicators signalled high buying momentum across the market. At press time, the coin’s Relative Strength Index (RSI) was 57.13, while its Money Flow Index (MFI) was 71.69.
At these values, these indicators suggested that market participants favoured XMR accumulation over its distribution.
Confirming an inflow of liquidity into the XMR market, its Chaikin Money Flow (CMF) had a reading of 0.14, at the time of writing. This indicator measures the flow of money into and out of an asset, with a positive CMF viewed as a sign of positive market strength.
Regarding XMR’s next price point, readings from its Fibonacci retracement revealed that if it successfully breaches the $134-price level, it would aim to exchange hands at $143 on the charts.

However, if this is invalidated and the bears exert pressure on the market, the altcoin’s price may fall below $125.

Crypto Exchanges Experience First Decline In Trading Volume In 7 Months: Implications Explored | Bitcoinist.com


								According to a recent Bloomberg report, trading volume on major cryptocurrency exchanges experienced a significant decline in April, marking the first drop in seven months. 
This decline coincided with a retreat in the price of Bitcoin, which had previously hit a record high of $73,700 on March 14th and then hit a monthly low of $59,000 in late April.
Trading Volume On Coinbase, Binance, And Kraken Tanks
Data from CCData, a renowned research firm, reveals that spot trading volume on centralized exchanges (CEXs) such as Coinbase Global, Binance, and Kraken decreased by 32.6% to $2 trillion last month. Additionally, derivatives trading volume experienced a decline of 26.1% to $4.57 trillion, marking the first decrease in seven months.

Earlier this year, trading volume surged following the introduction of 11 US spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) by the world’s largest asset managers. 
However, it slowed down due to tightening financial conditions in the United States, where the Federal Reserve (Fed) is grappling with the challenge of addressing persistent inflation. 
The anticipation of the Bitcoin Halving event on April 19, which reduced the supply of newly minted coins, had previously created excitement in the market, as Bitcoin had never reached its previous peak in previous bull cycles before the anticipated Halving event.
CME Group Records First Decline In Crypto Derivatives Volume 
Despite this troubling data ahead of several predictions of further price gains in the coming months for the largest cryptocurrencies on the market, Jacob Joseph, a research analyst at CCData, noted that the slowdown in trading activity on centralized exchanges following the Bitcoin Halving event is consistent with patterns observed in previous cycles. 
Moreover, the researcher highlights factors such as higher-than-expected Consumer Price Index (CPI) inflation data and escalating geopolitical tensions in the Middle East have introduced uncertainty and fear into the market. 
According to Joseph, these factors, combined with negative net flows from US spot Bitcoin ETFs, have contributed to a decline in the prices of major cryptocurrencies.
As trading volumes decreased, the spot market share of Binance, the world’s largest cryptocurrency exchange, dropped for the first time since September 2023. It declined by nearly 4% to 33.8%, reaching its lowest level since January, as reported by CCData.
Similarly, the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME) Group, a prominent derivatives exchange, experienced its first decline in crypto trading volume in seven months. In April, its derivatives trading volume fell by nearly 20% to $124 billion, according to CCData.
Despite the decline, Joseph emphasized that trading activity on centralized exchanges remains relatively high compared to volumes recorded in previous months. Although it has slowed down compared to the peak in March, the trading activity remains elevated.

Overall, this decrease in trading volume and market share highlights the impact of various factors on the cryptocurrency market, including the Bitcoin Halving event, inflation concerns, and geopolitical tensions. 
However, as Jacob Joseph noted, this decline is a consistent pattern and should not reflect any change in the prospects for further price increases in the market in the coming months.

Bitcoin Commencement Speaker Defends Ayahuasca-Fueled Speech, Praises Satoshi - Decrypt

The viral Ohio State University commencement speaker isn’t backing down, despite the negative attention his now-famous speech has received: Chris Pan believes in Bitcoin’s potential, he told Decrypt in an interview. And he thinks you should too.Why? Pan says that when his interest in Bitcoin was rekindled earlier this year, he was gripped by one key trend: The institutions are here.BlackRock and Fidelity piqued Pan’s interest in February as familiar Wall Street names pushed deeper into the esoteric market through spot Bitcoin ETFs, he told Decrypt. The development encouraged him to buy Bitcoin, and later include mention of it in his commencement speech.“I'm a Harvard MBA and former Facebook guy, so I understand adoption curves,” Pan said. “All of a sudden, I understood: Wow, we're ready to tip into the mainstream [...] This is Bitcoin’s IPO moment.”Graduating from OSU in 1999, Pan’s unorthodox commencement speech drew widespread attention this week—not only for its suggestion to consider investing in Bitcoin, but also for its musical numbers, magic trick, and ayahuasca-fueled origins. His controversial comments included calling Bitcoin “a very misunderstood asset class,” which provoked audience groans.Pan himself said he understood little about Bitcoin when he first heard of the asset in 2017. After purchasing a small amount in 2020, he then sold his BTC after a 20% dip, he said.“So embarrassing,” Pan recalled, adding that a steep drawdown had “freaked [him] out.”For years, the crypto-cognizant have keyed in on financial institutions as power players to watch. Not only could their steadily increasing involvement legitimize the digital assets space, but this year, asset managers’ products have been a main driver of Bitcoin’s year-to-date rally. From Pan’s point of view, it warranted an allocation of more than just “play money,” like before.“The ETFs, to me, offered convenience and a sense of security,” he said, noting that he need not worry about managing a digital wallet’s private keys with the product. “That was a sign that the asset class had matured enough for me to really get serious about it.”Before sharing his knowledge of Bitcoin with 60,000 Ohio State commencement attendees on Sunday, Pan said he sharpened his comments in conversations with family and friends. Within four weeks of rediscovering Bitcoin, that entailed talking with his brother, dad, cousins, and friends. He didn’t want them to miss out on Bitcoin, and believed that the asset could help them financially.It wasn’t until mid-March that Pan decided to include Bitcoin in his speech, he said. While emotional and spiritual health were always something always planned to touch on, he decided Bitcoin could be an example of why it’s beneficial to have an open mind.“I was like, ‘You know what? Let me just throw [it] in,” he said of Bitcoin’s inclusion. “It was just about financial health, of which Bitcoin was my example of something interesting to look at.”A social entrepreneur, musician, and inspirational speaker, one of Pan’s current endeavors involves a positive-affirmation jewelry business called MyIntent. In LinkedIn comments, responding to a psychedelics-centered post, several purported attendees said his speech on Sunday came across as him promoting his business, or an agenda.“All I said was: To be a great investor, you have to be open-minded and look for misunderstood opportunities,” he said. “Unfortunately, people just jump right to the conclusion.”Still, Pan believes that Bitcoin could solve real-world problems, such as addressing the scarcity of housing in the U.S. by providing real estate owners an alternative store of value.Drawing on his experience from the management consulting firm McKinsey & Company, Pan said he pieced together this new understanding of Bitcoin primarily through “YouTube University.”That included watching videos of Twitter founder and Block CEO Jack Dorsey talking about Bitcoin, as well as MicroStrategy executive founder and chairman Michael Saylor. One of Dorsey’s chats left a notable impression on Pan, he said, as it suggested that Bitcoin’s pseudonymous creator Satoshi Nakatomo was somewhat charitable.“Here's a trillion-dollar asset class where the founder disappeared after three years, and didn't want to come back and take credit for it,” Pan said. “I just thought that was like the coolest example of selflessness. And I think that's the most misunderstood part about Bitcoin.”Edited by Andrew HaywardStay on top of crypto news, get daily updates in your inbox.

White House Plans to Nominate CFTC Commissioner Johnson for Treasury Position


                        
                            White House Plans to Nominate CFTC Commissioner Johnson for Treasury Position

                        The White House is reportedly set to nominate Kristin Johnson, a commissioner at the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC), to fill a top role at the US Treasury Department overseeing banks, according to a May 9 report by Bloomberg.According to the report, Commissioner Johnson is endorsed to become the Assistant Secretary of the Treasury for Financial Institutions, with the announcement expected to be made public soon.CFTC Commissioner Expected to Coordinate with the US SEC
If confirmed, Johnson will lead financial policies on credit unions, insurance, and consumer protection. She will work closely with the Treasury Secretary and coordinate with federal regulators and banking agencies.The Assistant Secretary of the Treasury for Financial Institutions role has been vacant since Graham Steele’s departure in January 2024.So far, the news of a potential crossover for Johnson has sparked concerns regarding a conflict of interest in decision-making.Congressman Don Meuser expressed his non-approval of the switch in an X post on May 10.He argued that the commissioner’s imminent switch raises concerns about conflicting loyalties and interests for the official, which he believes could compromise the impartiality of the CFTC as an independent agency.Despite Meuser’s concerns, financial experts and observers are optimistic about Johnson’s confirmation, citing recent endorsements from influential figures such as Maxine Waters, the Congressional Black Caucus, and the top Democrat on the House Financial Services Committee.In a letter addressed to President Biden on May 2, Waters highlighted Johnson’s notable achievements and experience, endorsing her for the role.“In her role as a CFTC Commissioner, Commissioner Johnson has prioritized maintaining the integrity of our financial markets,” Congresswoman Waters stated. “She has pushed the Commission to adopt rigorous capital, collateral, and margin standards. Commissioner Johnson is also leading the CFTC’s work on artificial intelligence (AI) and encouraging the Commission to carefully evaluate whether existing regulation is fit-for-purpose or new regulation is required.”Waters, who recently expressed concerns about Meta’s crypto ventures, welcomes Johnson’s nomination. She believes her “person of color” status will ensure that the US Treasury Department’s leadership reflects diversity.Johnson’s tenure as a CFTC commissioner has been marked by her proactive stance, drawing major attention and acclaim. Last year, she presented a series of proposals to improve the CFTC’s oversight of crypto businesses.Notably, her plan includes empowering the regulator to scrutinize businesses seeking to acquire 10% or more of a CFTC-regulated exchange or clearinghouse. More recently, Johnson lauded the Binance settlement, which she described as a template for how crypto businesses should operate in the US.CFTC Commissioner Proposes New AI Recommendations
The report of Johnson’s nomination for the Treasury job follows the CFTC commissioner’s drive to address misuse and promote the regulation of artificial intelligence (AI).In a speech at the Sidley Austin and Rutgers Law School Fintech and Blockchain Symposium on May 3, Commissioner Johnson proposed measures such as heightened penalties to tackle AI’s role in financial markets, including decentralized finance (DeFi).The commissioner expressed concerns about AI in DeFi, highlighting how its integration into blockchain-based ecosystems could pose new challenges for supervision, compliance, risk management, and enforcement. She pointed out a key distinction with DeFi: its lack of a central authority, which sets it apart from traditional markets.Johnson also suggested the creation of an “AI Fraud Enforcement Task Force” comprising attorneys and investigators from various departments within the CFTC’s enforcement division and an inter-agency task force involving other regulators like the Federal Reserve and the Securities and Exchange Commission.

‘I’m Fine With It’: Donald Trump, a Former Digital Asset Skeptic, Continues To Court the Crypto Vote - The Daily Hodl


								Former US President Donald Trump is seeking the support of the crypto community to return to the White House.
In videos shared by crypto influencer Frank Degods on the social media platform X, Trump tells a group of supporters who bought his Mugshot Edition non-fungible tokens (NFTs) that he is accepting crypto donations for his campaign.










“Can we donate to the Trump campaign using crypto? I believe the answer is yes.” 
He also criticizes President Joe Biden and U.S. Securities Chairman Gary Gensler, saying they are against digital assets.
“[SEC Chair] Gensler is very much against it, the Democrats are very much against it.” 
Trump also says he does not have a problem with the current popularity of crypto as he woos digital asset supporters to vote for him in the upcoming November election.
“A lot of people are very much for it – probably a lot of people in this group and I’m fine with it. I want to make sure it’s good and solid and everything else, but I’m good with it. If you like crypto in any form, and it comes in a lot of different forms, if you’re in favor of crypto, you’d better vote for Trump.”
The former president used to be a crypto critic. In May 2018, while serving in the Oval Office, he reportedly directed then-Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin to “go after Bitcoin [for fraud].”
In a 2021 interview, Trump said that he was not invested in digital assets and that crypto might be fake.
“I like the currency of the United States. I think the others are potentially a disaster waiting to happen.”

Pepe Doge (PEPEDOGE) to Surge 7,600% After Solana Launch, Looks to Challenge Shiba Inu and Dogecoin



                    

Pepe Doge (PEPEDOGE) could become a viral memecoin, like Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE).



Pepe Doge (PEPEDOGE), a Solana memecoin that was launched today, is aiming to challenge other memecoin giants, such as Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE).




Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Pepe Doge presents a similar opportunity.



Pepe Doge has market cap below $15,000 at the moment, meaning that when it just reaches a modest market cap of $200,000-$500,000, early investors would generate returns of 2,000%-5,000% in a matter of days or hours.



The exciting memecoin is poised to rally 7,600% in the coming two days, and Pepe Doge could potentially reach a multi-million dollar market cap within a few weeks.




Currently, Pepe Doge can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jupiter and Raydium, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days.



To buy Pepe Doge on these platforms, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Pepe Doge by entering its contract address – 7s7VZhFWTez5ykSr214AxnqRTMdcKu5rd77YFAx2DGG1 – in the receiving field.



In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price.



If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner.




The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum.



This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like PEPEDOGE.

Stand With Crypto Unveils Political Action Committee (PAC) To Support Digital Asset-Friendly Candidates: Report - The Daily Hodl


								A nonprofit digital asset advocacy group backed by crypto exchange Coinbase is reportedly launching a Political Action Committee (PAC) to support crypto-friendly candidates.
According to a new report by Reuters, Stand With Crypto, a group with 440,000 members, is launching a PAC to support bipartisan politicians running for Senate or the House of Representatives.










Some of the candidates endorsed by the PAC include Jim Banks and Jim Justice, Republicans running for Senate positions in Indiana and West Virginia, respectively, and Shomari Figures and Eddy Morales, Democrats running for the House in Alabama and Oregon, respectively.
Also represented is Troy Downing, a Republican running to represent Montana’s Second District, according to the report.
As stated by Nick Carr, chief strategist at Stand With Crypto, to Reuters,
“The goal is to endorse candidates and support candidates that are protecting the rights of our advocates of Stand With Crypto throughout November.”
PACs differ from Super PACs because they cannot receive donations of unlimited size but are able to directly coordinate with the campaign.
In January, Stand With Crypto identified two politicians – Republican Senator Ted Cruz of Texas and Republican Senator Cynthia Lummis of Wyoming – as being lawmakers who are “strongly supportive” of crypto and gave them an A score.
Furthermore, the advocacy group identified two others – Democrat Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts and Democrat Senator Sherrod Brown of Ohio – as being “strongly against” virtual currencies, earning them an F score.

Kraken Challenges SEC's Case Accuracy in Ongoing Dispute


																Kraken and the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) remain embroiled in a dispute, as the crypto exchange filed a new document questioning the accuracy of the regulator’s case.
The development comes three months after Kraken filed a motion to dismiss the SEC’s lawsuit against it.
SEC’s Case Isn’t Worded Correctly
Kraken recently filed a response to the SEC’s April letter regarding the company’s motion to dismiss the case. In it, the exchange alleged that the securities regulator failed to identify any investment contracts that were traded, brokered, or settled on its platform.
The filing claims that the SEC used terms like “investment concept” and “ecosystem” instead of “investment contract” and “enterprise” in its argument.
The SEC had previously stated that “the words themselves do not delimit the security type because ‘the reach of the act does not stop with the obvious and commonplace,'” citing case law.
Kraken was accused of operating as an unregistered securities exchange, broker, dealer, and clearing agency by the SEC.




According to the regulator, Kraken unlawfully facilitated the trading of crypto asset securities since at least September 2018, generating hundreds of millions of dollars. The charges were similar to the ones leveled against Binance and Coinbase.
Kraken: SEC Overstepping Regulatory Authority
Following the accusations, the firm and its representatives denied the SEC’s claims, opting to contest the lawsuit in court.
In February, Kraken argued that the Commission was overstepping its regulatory authority in its motion seeking to dismiss the lawsuit. It also contested that cryptocurrencies, particularly those mentioned in the SEC’s complaint, should be treated as commodities rather than securities.
Later that same month, the Chamber of Digital Commerce (CDC) filed an amicus curiae to back Kraken’s motion, which said,
“The SEC does not allege fraud. The SEC does not allege consumer harm. The SEC’s sole claims are that Kraken has somehow operated in plain sight for almost a decade as an unregistered securities exchange, broker-dealer, and clearing agency, in violation of the Exchange Act.”

Bitcoin Plummets Toward $60k As Federal Reserve Considers Keeping Rates Elevated


																Bitcoin’s price fell 2.5% to $60,300 on Friday as Federal Reserve officials weighed their options for combatting stubborn price inflation in the United States.

Bitcoin traded for $63,400, at noon UTC on Friday, before plummeting below $61,000 over the next few hours.
According to Coinglass, the volatility triggered $175 million in liquidations over the past 24 hours. The single largest liquidation took place on a Binance BTC/USDT trade for $3.56 million.
Speaking at a Louisiana Bankers Association conference in New Orleans this week, Dallas Fed President Lorie Logan suggested it may be “too early to think about cutting rates,” according to Reuters.
“I need to see some of these uncertainties resolved about the path that we’re on, and we need to remain very flexible,” Logan said.
For the past few months, core PCE inflation – the Federal Reserve’s preferred inflation metric – has failed to make meaningful progress towards the central bank’s 2% target. What’s more, data on Friday showed a jolt to consumers’ inflation expectations, with year-ahead expectations rising to 3.5% next May.
During an interview with Reuters, Atlanta Fed President Raphael Bostic predicted that interest rates will still come down – but possibly only by 25 basis points before the end of the year.
“I still have that belief,” he said, noting that it is “going to take some time” before inflation finally falls.
Lower interest rates are perceived as a boon for Bitcoin and stocks, affording investors cheaper debt for buying up risk assets.

Curve DAO Defies $0.43 Resistance with 7-Day Green Streak - DailyCoin


        
The Curve DAO token has set sights on the path to recovery.



The token has mounted healthy gains over the past week.



Market analysts have charted a positive outlook for the altcoin market.  
The recent heightened volatility in the crypto market has taken its toll on various assets, with some experiencing gains while others face significant declines. Among those impacted negatively is Curve DAO (CRV), the native token of the Curve Finance DeFi protocol, which hit new lows following the April market crash due to its susceptibility to market trends.After a prolonged struggle to reverse its fortunes, the token has resurfaced with significant gains, signaling a path to recovery.CRV Uptick: Will It Hold?According to the CoinMarketCap data on Friday, May 10, Curve DAO’s value has experienced an upward momentum over the past week, currently trading at approximately $0.452. 
CRV’s current price marks a near 4% breakthrough from its $0.43 mark resistance, which it struggled at for over two weeks following its record-low plunge in April 2024. In addition, the native Curve Finance token has climbed 35% from its year-low price to reach $0.331. Despite this recent uptick, CRV remains substantially down from its year-high value of $0.863, raising concerns about its sustainability and the potential of reclaiming its previous gains.Curve DAO’s volatile performance mirrors the broader trend observed across the altcoin market.Altcoins’ Peak and Potholes: Where to Next?Over the past weeks, the majority of altcoins have struggled to uphold an upward momentum, with some assets pulling back substantially.
According to market analyst Rekt Capital, the initial excitement and increase in value seen in altcoins during the first quarter of the year has ended, resulting in the ongoing retrace witnessed across the market. The analysis stated that most assets began reaching their lowest point in early February, coinciding with the first quarter Bitcoin hype cycle.Rekt Capital further emphasized that if the same pattern repeats in the second quarter of the year, altcoins could reach their lowest point again as early as mid-May, citing the period between the end of May and early June as a more plausible timeframe.Offering a silver lining, the market analyst added that altcoins are expected to soon stabilize in prices, which could mark a turnaround in the ongoing downturn.Read more about the aftermath of Curve DAO’s crash to a new all-time low:Crypto Crash Puts Curve DAO CEO at Risk of Liquidation Altcoin SUI continues a downward market trend despite chain activity.

Cardano Price Prediction as Hoskinson Claims Biden is 'Killing Crypto' – Will ADA Fall to Zero? / Source: TradingView
                        The Cardano (ADA) price has reversed 4% lower on Friday, having once again found strong resistance at its 21DMA and amid comments from the crypto’s founder Charles Hoskinson that US President Joe Biden is trying to kill crypto.ADA was last changing hands around $0.445, with the 21DMA at $0.467 having blocked rallies for over a week.That’s a strong sign that bears remain in control of this market.As traders monitor the outlook for the Cardano price, they are also keeping comments from its founder on their radar.In a broadcast on X, Hoskinson made it clear to listeners that the Biden administration is trying to kill crypto.“This November, if you vote for J. Biden as a crypto holder, understand that this administration’s intention is to destroy the US crypto industry,” he noted.These claims are not without merit. Under Biden, the SEC has taken an aggressive regulation-by-enforcement approach to the crypto industry.The agency’s underlying assumption is that virtually all cryptos aside from Bitcoin are actually securities, bring them under its jurisdiction.ADA has been explicitly labeled as a security by the SEC, which weighed heavily on its price in 2023.The Biden administration has been accused of conducting “operation choke point 2.0” to debank crypto firms in the US.The SEC has also tried to stifle crypto via other means, including its SAB 121. The SAB 121 is being challenged by the US House, though Biden openly opposes these efforts.Cardano Price Prediction – Is ADA Going to Zero?
The near-term outlook for the Cardano (ADA) price is downbeat. The cryptocurrency has found strong resistance at its 21DMA going all the way back to late March.With the bears very much in control, a retest of recent lows around $0.40 looks likely.The Cardano price is threatening a bearish breakout as it finds resistance at its 21DMA. Source: TradingViewAnd the ADA price could go even lower. Adoption stories are keeping the prices of some of its rivals elevated, like Toncoin.But ADA lacks a strong adoption story, because its struggling to achieve any meaningful adoption.As per DeFi Llama, Cardano only has a TVL of around $350 million. That puts it 26th in the TVL rankings, behind little-known chains like Ultron, MultiverseX and Hyperliquid.That suggests its current market cap ranking of 10th could be an overvaluation.While ADA is unlikely to go to zero, its lack of adoption and lack of regulatory clarity could see it go much lower.Alternative to Consider – Investing in Presales
With the ADA outlook grim, investors will be looking for alternatives with a better chance of delivering short-term gains.An alternative high-risk, high-reward investment strategy worth considering is getting involved in crypto presales.Upcoming web3 protocols frequently sell their native tokens at an early-bird discount to fund development.If investors can reliably identify high-potential presales, they can make a great return.With so many presales vying for investor funds, knowing where to start can be daunting.Luckily, the team at Cryptonews compiled a list of what they deem to be the best crypto presales.See the 20 Crypto Presales

XRP investors are eagerly eyeing potential price movements amidst ongoing market fluctuations.

XRP price prediction
XRP is one of the top digital assets by market capitalization and it has been subject to moderate fluctuations in recent times.
Currently trading at $0.51, analysts foresee a potential rally if it manages to break the $0.57 level, with significant growth expected upon surpassing a major resistance at $0.67.
However, the ongoing legal battle between Ripple and the SEC remains a crucial factor influencing XRP’s valuation. Many industry participants anticipate a favourable outcome for Ripple, which could potentially propel XRP’s price to new heights.

With AI shaping the future of crypto through advanced fraud detection and risk management, and Telegram Trading Bot facilitating billions of dollars in trades, Bitbot is strategically positioned to capitalize on these trends.
Offering features like fast and reliable trading, secure hot project launches, and frictionless AI trading, Bitbot aims to provide traders with an unparalleled trading experience.
The platform also has a native cryptocurrency dubbed $BITBOT, which plays a crucial role in the platform’s ecosystem.
$BITBOT token holders enjoy privileges such as collecting 50% of bot trading fees, receiving a 50% share from token taxes, and gaining entry to private presales and select token deals. The token is currently in its 13th presale stage with the price set at $0.018, offering early bird investors an opportunity to jump in before the price rises to $0.0189 in the next presale stage.
Conclusion
As XRP enthusiasts monitor price movements and speculate on future trends, the emergence of Bitbot AI trading bot introduces a new paradigm in crypto trading.
With its advanced capabilities and user-centric approach, Bitbot aims to revolutionize the way investors engage with digital assets.

Eligible EigenLayer users for the phase one, season one distribution had been able to see their allocations in the claims portal for nearly two week but were unable to take custody of their tokens until today at 10 AM PST.
Many users had been understandably upset by EigenLayer’s claiming restrictions that prohibited access to residents of specific nations and VPN users, but methods to circumvent the frontend-imposed restriction have made the rounds on Crypto Twitter, highlighting the frivolity of EigenLayer’s ban in the first place and calling to light the unfortunate fact that US regulators will likely still try to establish jurisdiction against any token issuer conducting a permissionless airdrop.The initial outcry that the minimum EigenLayer allocation was insufficient to compensate for gas caused the EigenLayer Foundation to distribute an additional 100 EIGEN to all addresses that had interacted with the application prior to the April 29 “stakedrop” announcement.Despite EIGEN’s current $9 trading price on pre-market perpetual platforms like Aevo leaving this minimum allocation at a generous $900, holders will be unable to cash out as the EIGEN token is expected to be non-transferable until EigenLayer ships a mainnet complete with live actively validated services (AVSs) and operator slashing this September.
Until then, there is literally only one thing to do!After claiming their EIGEN, recipients can stake their allocation and delegate it to EigenDA, the proprietary EigenLayer data availability solution that leverages the network’s restaked capital to provide enhanced capital efficiency as opposed to competitors like Celestia.Users who had previously restaked ETH to an EigenDA operator will have their EIGEN automatically delegated to the same operator once staked, meanwhile, users who have not previously delegated to an EigenDA operator will have to undertake this action for themselves.While EigenDA will be the only AVS allowing users to restake EIGEN upon the feature’s launch, it is anticipated that additional services will soon opt in, enabling stakedrop recipients to generate returns from their allocations by positioning for additional airdrops from AVSs, even though they are unable to directly monetize the drop at this time.

Lightning Labs Is Bringing Stablecoins to the Bitcoin Blockchain: CEO - Decrypt

We do the research, you get the alpha!Get exclusive reports and access to key insights on airdrops, NFTs, and more! Subscribe now to Alpha Reports and up your game!Go to Alpha ReportsThe developer behind Bitcoin's Lightning Network has tested a protocol designed to enable stablecoins to be issued on the Bitcoin blockchain, its CEO said.Speaking at the Financial Times Crypto and Digital Assets Summit this week, Lightning Labs CEO Elizabeth Stark said that the developer had recently executed a test transaction on the Lightning Network with an asset created using the Taproot Assets protocol."We've released an early part of the code in October, and actually just on this past Thursday, demoed the first-ever transaction on Lightning of an asset," Stark said. "The idea is to have crypto dollars and stablecoins" on the Bitcoin blockchain, she explained."I really care deeply about solving real problems for real people, as opposed to meme coins or gambling," Stark said, adding that the ability to position stablecoins and other assets atop Bitcoin will "facilitate new use cases and bring more people on to the internet of money and digital assets."Stark also highlighted a post-halving wave of developer interest in Bitcoin, with "many builders coming back" to the blockchain. She pointed to developers building out decentralized finance (DeFi) on Bitcoin, as well as projects such as bitVM, which enables developers to build Turing-complete Bitcoin contracts.Eliminating the "idea of cross border"Lightning Labs' technology is designed "to eliminate the idea of cross border and just enable people to transact globally," Stark said."The concept of a cross-border payment is something that we hear about a lot," she added, before questioning "Why should we even call it ‘cross border’ anymore? We don't have cross-border emails, we don't have cross-border text messages.""I don't have to pay any fees to send an image to a friend across the world—value on the internet, and money, should function the same," she continued.Stark pointed to a recent IMF report which found that Bitcoin "has become an increasingly important channel to send remittances and evade capital controls in emerging markets."That finding, she said, was "not at all surprising to those of us who are on the ground who are working with developers and communities in these places." In markets subject to hyperinflation and authoritarian regimes, she said, "Bitcoin becomes an asset and a means of transacting when they don't have other options."Edited by Ryan Ozawa.Stay on top of crypto news, get daily updates in your inbox.

EigenLayer Airdrop Claims Go Live - The Defiant

The EIGEN token is not yet transferable but can be staked and delegated to EigenDA node operators.Ethereum restaking protocol EigenLayer has opened up airdrop claims for users that participated in its stakedrop.Eligible recipients can claim their EIGEN tokens here.EIGEN Airdrop ClaimIt appears that the project has dropped some of the geographical restrictions for the claim, although VPNs remain blocked.EigenLayer is DeFi’s third-largest protocol, with $14.4 billion in total value locked (TVL), according to DeFiLlama. It enables users to re-stake their Ether or liquid staking tokens (LSTs) to earn additional yield by securing third-party applications called Actively Validated Services (AVS).Once claimed, users can stake and delegate their tokens to a node operator for EigenDA, a data availability protocol that is the first AVS built atop EigenLayer. The project has previously stated that it aims to make EIGEN transferable by Sept. 30.

Dogecoin Gears Up For $0.20 Amid Rising Large Holder Netflow - DailyCoin


        
Whales continue withdrawing DOGE from Robinhood, DOGE fetches 2.5%.



On-chain metrics showcase a long-term holder resurgence for DOGE.



DOGE loses bearish constraints, but is yet to break the $0.15 resistance.
The top dog meme coin Dogecoin (DOGE) continues the uphill battle towards the long-term price target of $0.20, last seen on April 8, 2024. While the brutally bearish price trend over the past 30 days has sent DOGE back to $0.12 on May 1, 2024, DOGE managed to recoup some of the monthly losses this Friday, picking up 2.5% gains over the past 24 hours.More DOGE Gets Pulled Out Of RobinhoodThe bullish price trend switch for DOGE came after the continuation of whale withdrawals from Robinhood. The popular American crypto exchange is facing legal scrutiny from the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), which issued a Wells Notice to the company’s headquarters at Menlo Park, California. Two days after the Wells Notice issuance on May 4, 2024, one Dogecoin whale had transferred 164 million DOGE, equivalent to $25 million, out of the troubled Robinhood exchange. The whale outflows continued in smaller amounts as well, as Dogecoin’s trading volume topped $1 billion in a 24-hour timeframe on May 8, 2024.
Currently, Dogecoin’s trading volume in spot markets is back above $1 billion, while another crypto whale transferred a hefty 120,000,000 Dogecoins DOGE out of Robinhood, piling up to over $18 million at the current exchange rate. Conducted minutes after midnight on May 10, 2024, this transfer can be labeled as an accumulation move.After further investigation by DailyCoin, it was discovered that the receiving crypto wallet now holds a whopping 1,922,284,865 DOGE, summing up to $288.4 million, according to the wallet statement from Blockchair, a popular blockchain explorer.Dogecoin Thrives On Loyal Holder SupportMeanwhile, Dogecoin’s on-chain metrics are pointing to a positive shift among long-term investors, as the cryptocurrency wallets holding DOGE for over a year have substantially increased. While the long-term DOGE holder count has spiked by 26% since last month, there are now more long-term holders than cruisers, according to blockchain analytics firm IntoTheBlock.By definition, a crypto cruiser is someone who holds the cryptocurrency between 1 and 12 months, while a crypto trader is someone who trades cryptocurrency on a daily basis, therefore only crypto holders who sell during the first month qualify under that category. 
With both DOGE cruisers and daily traders dropping, it could be understood that Dogecoin’s holders are shifting from quick gain expectations to accumulating Dogecoin (DOGE) as a long-term investment solution. As of press time, DOGE is changing hands at $0.1477, sliding down from the daily heights of $0.1535 recorded minutes after midnight on May 10, 2024.On the Flipside
Dogecoin’s liquidations in derivatives markets have piled up to $2.94 million over the latest 24-hour period, despite a relatively narrow price range.
Why This MattersDogecoin’s holder base has continued to grow since 2021, despite the meme coin having significantly less publicity than during the 2021 crypto boom.Check out DailyCoin’s latest crypto stories:Biden Is “Destroying Crypto”: Cardano Founder Lambasts AdminBlast Initiates 15 Million Gold Points Distribution Event

Banking Giant Wells Fargo Reveals Investments in Bitcoin ETFs - Decrypt

We do the research, you get the alpha!Get exclusive reports and access to key insights on airdrops, NFTs, and more! Subscribe now to Alpha Reports and up your game!Go to Alpha ReportsAmerican banking giant Wells Fargo disclosed investments in multiple Bitcoin ETFs Friday, per a regulatory filing, making it the latest institution to get onboard with the crypto-based vehicles.Paperwork filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) shows that the bank has bought shares of Grayscale's GBTC spot Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF), and that it also has exposure to Bitcoin Depot Inc., a Bitcoin ATM provider.The document also shows that the bank has invested in ProShares Bitcoin Strategy ETF (BITO), which gives investors exposure to BTC futures—contracts that bet on the future price of the asset.But the exposure is small: The filing shows that Wells Fargo's investment in GBTC amounts to $141,817, while its ProShares investment is under $1,200. And the exposure to Bitcoin Depot stands at just $99.Back in February, a report claimed that Wells Fargo—along with Bank of America's Merrill division—was offering its wealth management clients exposure to Bitcoin ETFs via brokerage accounts.Wells Fargo has repeatedly talked about investment in digital assets, and back in 2019 piloted its own digital currency.The SEC in January approved 11 spot BTC ETFs, and since then, the products have been wildly successful, notching billions of dollars in inflows.Bitcoin's price has soared as ordinary investors have gotten involved in the space by buying shares that track the price of the biggest digital coin. In March, Bitcoin's price hit a new all-time high of $73,747.It has dropped steadily in recent weeks, however—now Bitcoin is trading at nearly $60,545 per coin, CoinGecko shows.Edited by Andrew HaywardStay on top of crypto news, get daily updates in your inbox.

                        The International Monetary Fund (IMF) recommended on May 10 that Nigeria regulate crypto trading platforms amid the African nation’s detainment of two Binance executives, according to a United Nations Thursday staff report.Nigeria Should Regulate Crypto Trading Platforms, IMF Report Says
“Staff recommends that global crypto trading platforms be registered or licensed in Nigeria and subject to the same regulatory requirements applicable to financial intermediaries following the principle of same activity, same risk, and same regulation,” the report read.Nigeria has been in a financial crisis in recent months, with its once-dominant economy expected to plummet to fourth place on the African continent.Despite the country’s inflation hitting a near 28-year high, the IMF report stated that the country’s currency is beginning to steady.“The naira depreciated sharply after the unification of the official foreign exchange windows in June 2023,” the IMF noted. “Following monetary policy tightening in February and March 2024 and a resumption of FX interventions, the naira has started to stabilize.”Binance Executives Detained Amid Nigerian Crypto Crackdown
Nigeria has been cracking down on digital assets recently. In the coming days, the country will ban peer-to-peer payment systems in hopes of preventing manipulation.Some government officials have shifted the blame for the naira’s weakening to cryptocurrencies, with Nigerian Central Bank Governor Olayemi Cardoso alleging in February that $26 billion worth of illicit funds shuffled through Binance Nigeria in 2023 alone. “We are concerned that certain practices that go on that indicate illicit flows through a number of these entities and suspicious flows at best,” Cardoso said. “In the case of Binance, $26 billion has passed through Binance Nigeria from sources and users we cannot adequately identify.”Concerns have swirled over the country’s arrest of two Binance executives, Nadeem Anjarwalla and Tigran Gambaryan, on money laundering and tax evasion charges in over the crypto exchange’s operations.Both Anjwarwalla and Gambaryan were in the country for policy meetings with regulators amidst tensions with the African nation.Earlier this week, Binance CEO Richard Teng claimed that “unknown persons” proposed a secret settlement between the crypto exchange’s employees and Nigerian officials “to make these issues go away.”Binance refused to engage in such a deal, leading to Anjarwalla and Gambaryan’s eventual capture. The two are due back in court for a hearing in Abuja on May 17.Despite questions over the legality of the Binance executives’ arrest, IMF’s latest staff report may signify a future increase in foreign crypto exchanges in Nigeria overall.

Was Sam Bankman-Fried Proven Right About FTX’s Solvency?

To make it brief, in the days leading up to FTX’s bankruptcy on Nov. 11, 2022, SBF was frantically trying to shore up a gigantic hole in his company’s balance sheet by raising funds basically from anyone he could. This reportedly includes everyone from Silicon Valley VCs, Saudi money men and even SBF’s archrival ex-CEO of Binance Changpeng Zhao (who reneged on a handshake buyout deal after reviewing the state of FTX’s finances, only speeding up the ongoing run on the exchange).

Ethereum Layer-2 Scaling Solution Arbitrum Flashes Potentially Bullish Indicator, According to Crypto Analyst - The Daily Hodl


								A widely followed crypto analyst says that Ethereum (ETH) layer-2 scaling solution Arbitrum (ARB) could be flashing a potentially bullish indicator.
In a new thread, crypto trader Ali Martinez tells his 61,900 followers on the social media platform X that ARB’s Tom DeMark (TD) Sequential Indicator has presented a buy signal on the asset’s weekly chart.










“It anticipates a one to four candlesticks rebound for ARB!”

Traders use the TD Sequential Indicator to predict potential trend reversals for tokens based on the closing prices of their 13 previous bars or candles.
ARB is trading at $1.04 at time of writing. The 47th-ranked crypto asset by market cap is up nearly 2% in the past 24 hours but down more than 30% in the past month.
Martinez also notes that Bitcoin (BTC) has been consolidating for 70 days.

The analyst says that Bitcoin’s Market Value to Realized Value (MVRV) 90-day ratio indicates the top crypto asset is still in a “prime buy zone” despite its price surge this week.
MVRV is the ratio of Bitcoin’s market capitalization relative to its realized capitalization (the value of all BTC at the price they were bought). It is used to assess whether the crypto asset is undervalued or overvalued.

Bitcoin's roadmap to $75K - Why this pattern is critical for BTC's price - AMBCrypto



BTC’s price has appreciated by over 6% as it approached $63k on the charts
Most metrics and indicators flashed green too

Bitcoin’s [BTC] price action once again turned volatile as it swiftly approached $63k on the charts. In the meantime, however, a pattern seemed to be forming on the cryptocurrency’s price chart – A sign that BTC’s price might hit $75k in the coming weeks. 
Bitcoin’s price action looks promising
According to CoinMarketCap, BTC has gained by more than 6% over the past week, with it appreciating by 3% in the last 24 hours alone. At the time of writing, BTC was trading at $62,998.95 with a market capitalization of over $1.24 trillion. 
Despite its fall from its ATH, however, most market analysts remain positive about the crypto’s price action. In fact, AMBCrypto had previously reported that Ki Young Ju, CEO of analytics firm CryptoQuant, claimed that Bitcoin’s network fundamentals could support a market valuation “three times its current size.” 
While BTC’s price action turned bullish, Titan of Cryptos, a popular crypto-analyst, pointed out in a tweet that an inverse head-and-shoulder pattern was forming on BTC’s price chart. As per the tweet, the pattern suggested that BTC’s price might soon cross its all-time high (ATH) and hit $75k in the coming weeks. 
However, the tweet also mentioned the adverse scenario. If everything doesn’t fall into place, then BTC might drop down to $56k again. Hence, it’s worth taking a closer look at the cryptocurrency’s state to see which outcome is more likely. 
What to expect from Bitcoin?
AMBCrypto’s analysis of CryptoQuant’s data revealed that Bitcoin’s exchange reserves have been dropping. This clearly meant that buying pressure was high, which can be inferred as a bullish signal. 
Its binary CDD suggested that long-term holders’ movements in the last 7 days were lower than average, meaning that they have a motive to hold their coins. On top of that, BTC’s NVT ratio dropped last week, meaning that it was undervalued. These metrics backed the possibility of BTC touching or going above its ATH.

However, its aSORP flashed opposing signals. 
At press time, BTC’s aSORP was red, indicating that more investors have been selling at a profit. In the middle of a bull market, this can indicate a market top. 
Source: CryptoQuant
To check whether the market has reached its top, AMBCrypto then analyzed BTC’s daily chart. As per our analysis, BTC was testing its 20-day exponential moving average (EMA) at the time. A successful breakout above it would ensure a sustained bull rally.

Its Money Flow Index (MFI) also registered a sharp uptick. 
On the contrary, the Chaikin Money Flow (CMF) looked bearish. This was a sign that BTC’s price might start to decline, which could push its value down to $56k on the charts.

Dogecoin Whales Shake The Market With 265 Million DOGE Buy, Can They Send It To $1? | Bitcoinist.com


								Dogecoin holders are accumulating DOGE tokens amidst the recent price dip from $0.1686 to $0.1423. DOGE recently went on a price surge to cross above the $0.168 price level on May 6 to push 5.21 million addresses into profitability. However, the cryptocurrency reversed and went on a little correction throughout May 7. According to on-chain data from Santiment, large DOGE holders capitalized on this drop and added around 265.86 million DOGE tokens to their wallets. 
Whales Accumulating DOGE
According to data from Santiment, an on-chain analytics platform, DOGE addresses holding between 100 million to 1 billion DOGE recently saw their cumulative holdings increase by 1% on May 7 to reach 21% of the total supply. Interestingly, the number of tokens held by this cohort of traders increased by 265.86 million DOGE, worth approximately $41.2 million. This increase, when compared to their holdings a day before, indicated a notable change from a previous 342 million DOGE outflow from large holders. 

Recent on-chain data suggests that this accumulation from exchanges is still ongoing. Interestingly, data from Whale Alerts indicated an example of an accumulation of 120 million DOGE tokens worth $18 million from crypto exchange Robinhood in the last few hours. This continued accumulation suggests that a few whales are still in bullish sentiment for DOGE and are positioning themselves for when their bullish outlook eventually materializes. 

Santiment
Why Does This Matter For Dogecoin?
Whale movement and sentiment are essential for any cryptocurrency, particularly for a meme token like Dogecoin, whose value is mostly driven by hype and market sentiment and not by a demand for its utility. These whales typically move the market, and an accumulation or selloff from a few large traders could change the sentiment of other investors. 
At the time of writing, DOGE is trading at $0.1516. The price correction between May 6 and May 9 seems to have ended after bouncing off at the $0.143 level. Currently, DOGE is up by 3% in the past 24 hours and 14% in the past seven days. Consequently, this shows that the accumulation may have contributed to a bullish effect on the price of DOGE.

On a larger timeframe, the $0.143 price level is a strong support level for DOGE. The recent bounce could be a starting point for the next leg up to new highs this month. A continued accumulation from the bulls could send the price of Dogecoin across resistances at $0.16 and $0.20. This, in turn, could lead to DOGE finally pumping above its current all-time high and eventually reaching $1. For this to happen, many bullish factors apart from accumulation need to be put in place. On the other hand, a bearish reversal could see DOGE falling to the next support at $0.13. 
According to Santiment, most of the attention surrounding meme coins is going into TRUMP, TURBO, PONKE, and MYRO.

Crypto Analyst Updates Outlook on Altcoins and the Potential of an Ethereum (ETH) ETF Approval This Month - The Daily Hodl


								A widely followed crypto analyst is suggesting that altcoins could be on the rise as hopes for an Ethereum (ETH) exchange-traded fund (ETF) approval this month from the U.S. Securities and Exchanges Commission (SEC) this month dwindle.
Crypto trader Michaël van de Poppe tells his 717,300 followers on the social media platform X that altcoins are waking up as Bitcoin (BTC) hovers near $61,000.










“Markets did bounce from the crucial area at $61,000 and Altcoins are waking up. 
It’s the final accumulation period before the big surge.”
BTC is worth $60,933 at time of writing, down 2% on the day.
Looking specifically at the altcoin Arbitrum (ARB), the analyst thinks the ETH layer-2 protocol is near the end of its full correction.
“This one has a full correction and is at the end stage of the correction.
Massive cascade in the past weeks, through which the markets often fill that wick in the weeks after.
In that regard, markets are close to the end of the correction.”
Source: Michaël van de Poppe/X
ARB is trading for $1.01 currently, down 2% on the day.
Van de Poppe also asserts that he doesn’t believe the SEC will approve an ETH ETF until at least July or August of this year.
“There won’t be an Ethereum ETF this month. 
It is likely to be a delay or extension of 60 days, during which July/August will be the big moment for the markets.
In terms of expectations?
The markets are bottoming in the next 1-2 weeks and rotate back up from that news.”
ETH is worth $2,914 at time of writing, down 5% on the week.

BREAKING: JPMorgan, Largest Bank in the US, Announces It Owns Bitcoin Spot ETF Holdings - Bitcoin Sistemi


JPMorgan, the largest US bank, owns approximately $1 million worth of Bitcoin Spot ETF shares, according to a filing with the SEC.
This statement comes despite the bank's CEO Jamie Dimon having previously expressed strong anti-Bitcoin views.


Dimon has expressed skepticism towards Bitcoin, going so far as to call it a “ponzi scheme” and “a scam with no future as a currency.” He has consistently advised investors to stay away from the volatile digital asset.
However, the latest statement shows a divergence between the CEO's personal views and the bank's investment strategies. JPMorgan Chase is an authorized participant in Blackrock's spot Bitcoin ETF, a stark contrast to Dimon's public stance on cryptocurrency.

Crypto Markets Drop on Disappointing U.S. Economic Data - The Defiant

Bitcoin plunged after lacklustre U.S. economic data and hawkish comments from Dallas Fed President Lori Logan.Crypto markets fell sharply on Friday morning, reversing an earlier rally that had propelled the world's largest cryptocurrency to as high as $64,212 this week.Bitcoin (BTC) is trading at $61,015 — down 2% in the last 24 hours. Ether (ETH) is down nearly 4%, with Dogecoin (DOGE) tumbling over 3.5%. Most digital assets in the CoinGecko top 100 posted losses.BTC PriceThe catalysts for the drop in crypto prices were disappointing U.S. economic data and hawkish remarks from Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas President Lori Logan.“It’s just too early to think about cutting rates,” Logan said on Friday at an event in New Orleans. “I need to see some of these uncertainties resolved about the path that we’re on and we need to remain very flexible to policy and continue to look at the data that’s coming in and watch how financial conditions are evolving.”Consumer sentiment data released Friday morning showed a significant increase in inflation expectations, dampening market enthusiasm. The preliminary May reading for the University of Michigan's consumer sentiment index was 67.4, falling well below the Dow Jones estimate of 76 and representing its lowest reading in six months.Since their July 2023 meeting, Fed officials have maintained the benchmark U.S. interest rate at a steady range of 5.25% to 5.5%.Token unlocks loomCrypto analytics firm 10x Research reported on Wednesday that over $2 billion worth of tokens will be added to circulation in the next two months.The report notes that $97 million of Aptos (APT), $79 million of Starkware (STRK), $94 million of Arbitrum (ARB), $330 million of Avalanche (AVAX), and nearly $1 billion of SUI (SUI), among others, are slated to be unlocked.“A rapid succession of nearly $2 billion of token unlocks during the next ten weeks could lower the market for altcoins," said 10x Research in a report seen by The Defiant.According to Michael Van de Poppe, CEO of MN Trading, Bitcoin is currently at its range low.“This is technically the area where you'd prefer to see it hold, so the upward momentum continues, and the range holds,” he said on X. “If this doesn't hold, then we might expect $52-55K as a potential low on this correction.”Grayscale Bitcoin Trust sees inflowsIn May, the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) saw inflows of $66.9 million, a change after experiencing continuous outflows totaling over $17.5 billion in the last 78 days following its Jan. 11 conversion into an ETF.Meanwhile, BlackRock's iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) has attracted the largest amount of capital, totaling nearly $15.5 billion to date.

                        Trading volume on major cryptocurrency exchanges has experienced a significant decline in April, coinciding with Bitcoin’s retreat from its all-time high.Spot trading volume on centralized exchanges like Coinbase Global, Binance, and Kraken dropped by 32.6% to $2 trillion last month, as reported by research firm CCData.Additionally, derivatives trading volume saw its first decrease in seven months, falling by 26.1% to $4.57 trillion.Trading Volume Declines Due to Tightening Financial Conditions
The surge in trading volume witnessed earlier in the year, following the introduction of US exchange-traded funds investing in Bitcoin, waned due to the tightening of financial conditions in the United States.The Federal Reserve’s efforts to address persistent inflation challenges contributed to this shift.Prior to the April 19 Bitcoin halving event, which reduced the supply of new coins by half, there was anticipation and excitement within the market.Jacob Joseph, a research analyst at CCData, told Bloomberg that the decline in trading activity on centralized exchanges after the Bitcoin halving event aligns with patterns observed in previous cycles.He further explained that the release of higher-than-expected Consumer Price Index (CPI) inflation data and escalating geopolitical tensions in the Middle East injected uncertainty and fear into the market.These factors and negative net flows from spot Bitcoin ETFs led to major crypto assets reaching their range lows.The decline in trading volumes also affected the spot market share of Binance, the world’s largest crypto exchange.For the first time since September 2023, Binance’s spot market share dropped by almost 4% to 33.8%, reaching its lowest level since January, according to CCData.The CME Group, a prominent derivatives marketplace, also experienced a decline in crypto trading volume for the first time in seven months.In April, its derivatives trading volume decreased by nearly 20% to $124 billion, as reported by CCData.Despite the decline, Jacob Joseph mentioned that trading activity on centralized exchanges, while slower compared to its peak in March, remains at an elevated level compared to previous months.CEX Trading Volume Triples in 2024
Centralized cryptocurrency exchanges (CEXs) like Binance experienced a large surge in trading volumes between October 2023 and March 2024, according to Bybit’s 2024 Institutional Industry Report released on April 18.Notably, OKX saw a 278% increase in 30-day volumes since October, followed closely by Binance, which saw a 239% surge.Bybit exchange also demonstrated impressive growth, adding 264% to its trading volumes during the same period.As confirmed by a spokesperson for Bybit, these exchanges have outpaced the industry’s average growth rate of 255%.The U.S.-based exchange Coinbase also witnessed growth, albeit slightly trailing behind with a 193% increase in trading volume.The CEX growth hasn’t surpassed the even more rapid expansion of decentralized exchanges (DEXs), however.Leading DEX Uniswap v3, for instance, saw a 320% increase in volumes during the same period, as highlighted in Bybit’s data.Uniswap has surpassed $2 trillion in lifetime trading volume.

Dogwifhat’s $5 Dream Inches Closer As Early WIF Whales Return - DailyCoin


        
An early bird investor who made $8M on dogwifhat comes back for more WIF.



dogwifhat fetches over $1.2B in daily trading volume on Derivatives markets.



Chart analyst examines the bullish pennant’s potential on WIF’s 4-hour charts.
Solana’s meme coin frenzy is unexpectedly returning after a period of calm. A change in large investor sentiment was spotted by LookOnChain, a popular crypto whale tracking agency that notified their X audience about an abnormally large acquisition of dogwifhat (WIF) in the early hours of Friday, May 10, 2024.
In further detail, one Solana (SOL) whale traded a whopping 4.2M of the popular stablecoin USD Coin (USDC) for 1.4M Dogwifhat (WIF) tokens at an average price of $2.99. Digging deeper into the relevant whale’s wallet, DailyCoin discovered that WIF is now the 2nd largest holding in the whale’s portfolio.Interestingly, Dogwifhat (WIF) stands out as the only meme coin in the whale’s crypto portfolio that is listed on centralized crypto exchanges (CEXs). In contrast to other holdings like GEN, Pepe On Fire and Boxxy Coin, WIF is the only major meme coin, currently boasting a global market capitalization of $3,168,454,299.A Bullish Pennant To Save WIF From The Bears?Following the gargantuan whale’s acquisition of 1.4M dogwifhat (WIF), crypto analysts believe this to be a sign of early investor return to Solana’s pink hat-wearing canine cryptocurrency. According to LookOnChain, the Solana whale has previously made a whopping $8 million profit from his early entrance into dogwifhat.Returning a colossal 206,014% profit since the meme coin’s inception 5 months ago, WIF surged all the way to $4.83 on March 31, 2024. However, this milestone has a bittersweet feeling among crypto investors on X, as many have drawn the $5 price target as a key milestone in dogwifhat’s long-term growth.Certainly, dogwifhat backtracked 33.6% from the all-time high, but today’s 12% upswing has brought in some fresh air for WIF holders. To illustrate, crypto analyst YG Crypto spotted a bullish pennant for dogwifhat (WIF) on the 4-hour technical charts. This pattern usually hints at a double-digit breakout, if WIF closes the day above the upper trendline, depicted in blue color.
In such a case, trader YG Crypto forecasts a 50% run for WIF, which could be sufficient to reach dogwifhat’s long-term price target of $5. After being rejected at the price range again in April, dogwifhat’s early investor support could serve as a game-changer for the emerging meme coin. As of press time, the #39 seated Dogwifhat is changing hands at $3.17, according to CoinGecko.On the Flipside
While dogwifhat (WIF) finished March 2024 as the third largest meme coin by global market cap, the competing meme coin Pepe (PEPE) soon outshined WIF due to deeper spot liquidity.



However, Dogwifhat managed to restore dominance in derivatives markets, as dogwifhat’s trading volume in futures spiked by 15% to claim above $1.24 billion in the latest 24-hour period.
Why This MattersAccording to Dune Analytics, the meme coin department has been outperforming other strong narrative crypto sectors like artificial intelligence (AI) and real-world assets (RWAs), yielding a 315% year-to-date profit growth.Read DailyCoin’s popular cryptocurrency news:Robinhood Sees Massive Dogecoin Outflows After Wells NoticeCrypto Mixers Facing the Blender as U.S. Amps up Enforcement

Millions In Dogecoin (DOGE) Pulled From Robinhood Following SEC Wells Notice ⋆ ZyCrypto

&nbsp

&nbsp
Tens of millions of dollars worth of the leading meme coin Dogecoin (DOGE) has exited Robinhood amid potential legal action from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) against the popular trading platform.



Robinhood Sees Massive DOGE Withdrawals 



Robinhood has seen a significant exodus of funds as users rush to pull their Dogecoin holdings from the platform.



According to X-based blockchain tracker bot Whale Alert, a whopping 120 million DOGE tokens — valued at an estimated $18.1 million based on the market price at the time — were transferred from Robinhood to an unknown wallet. 



The receiver of this massive transfer, identified only by the address “DDuXG,” is not new to crypto. DDuXG is a Dogecoin whale well-known for making huge moves in the market. Following the latest transaction, DDuXG’s wallet address now holds a staggering 1.92 billion DOGE, equivalent to $292.4 million.



Additionally, on-chain tracking platform Bitcoinsensus revealed on May 8 that 164 million DOGE worth $25 million was transferred out of Robinhood.

&nbsp



These significant withdrawals come in the wake of Robinhood’s legal drama with the SEC.



SEC Preparing To Sue Robinhood



As we reported previously, Robinhood, which only offers 15 cryptocurrencies, including DOGE, on its U.S. platform, received a Wells notice — a preliminary warning from the securities watchdog about potential enforcement action — on May 4.



Speaking recently on CNBC Last Call, Robinhood CEO Vlad Tenev said the SEC opted to pursue regulation by enforcement despite the stock trading platform meeting with the SEC 16 times “in good faith” in a bid to register as a special purpose broker-dealer supporting cryptocurrencies. 



The attack against Robinhood comes as the SEC has ramped up its regulatory warnings issued toward U.S.-based crypto companies, with the agency recently serving Ethereum development company Consensys and decentralized exchange (DEX) developer Uniswap Labs with Wells Notices. 



The lack of federal regulatory clarity has undoubtedly created an uneven playing field for crypto market participants, challenging regulatory compliance and hampering mainstream adoption. Yet, without a clear regulatory framework, regulators will likely continue to crack down on crypto firms in the coming months.

Pepe (PEPE) price prediction as a new challenger emerges - CoinJournal



                    

                    
Pepe (PEPE) defies volatility, bullish pennant forms, potential breakout predicted.

Pepe’s resilience challenged by Kangamoon’s innovative approach.

Recently, Pepe (PEPE) has been making waves with its resilient performance amidst market fluctuations. Despite its current price decline, market analysts have pointed to bullish Pepe price prediction.
However, a new challenger, Kangamoon, has entered the arena, aiming to disrupt the meme coin sector.
Let’s delve into the price predictions for Pepe and explore Kangamoon’s potential impact on the market.
Pepe (PEPE) price prediction: riding the bullish wave
Pepe (PEPE) has demonstrated remarkable resilience in the face of market volatility, defying expectations with its upward trajectory. Despite its low utility, Pepe has carved out a niche for itself, outperforming even established altcoins like Solana (SOL) and giant meme coins like Dogecoin (DOGE) and Shiba Inu (SHIB).
Recent analysis indicates a bullish pennant pattern formation, signalling a potential breakout above the $0.000009123 resistance level.
Technical indicators such as the Relative Strength Index (RSI) and Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) suggest a sustained bullish momentum, with a target set for a new all-time high (ATH) above $0.0000107.
In addition, investors are also eyeing a golden cross formation at $0.000006862, further fueling optimism for Pepe’s future.
A new meme coin challenging giants like Pepe
Enter Kangamoon (KANG), the latest entrant in the meme coin arena, poised to disrupt the status quo.
With its unique blend of SocialFi and Play-to-Earn elements, Kangamoon aims to create a vibrant community of meme enthusiasts while offering opportunities for users to interact, grow, and earn.
Integrating GameFi features, Kangamoon invites users to embark on quests, engage in epic battles, and earn $KANG tokens and exclusive rewards.
Boasting a presale event that has already raised over $6.5 million, Kangamoon is generating significant interest among investors. Interested investors can purchase Kangamoon’s native token $KANG at $0.025 per token with only 1.10% of the presale tokens sold.
As the project progresses through its roadmap, including the launch of its P2E arcade and merchandise website, Kangamoon presents a formidable challenge to established meme coins like Dogecoin (DOGE) and Shiba Inu (SHIB).
Conclusion
As Pepe (PEPE) charts its course amid market fluctuations, the emergence of Kangamoon (KANG) introduces a new dynamic to the meme coin landscape.
While Pepe’s price predictions point to a potential bullish rally, Kangamoon’s innovative approach to SocialFi and Play-to-Earn gaming presents a compelling alternative for investors and meme enthusiasts alike.
As both projects evolve and compete for dominance, the cryptocurrency community eagerly awaits the next chapter in this unfolding saga.

New Critical Binance Move by the US Department of Justice - Bitcoin Sistemi

The US Department of Justice has selected Forensic Risk Alliance (FRA), a consulting firm specializing in corruption and fraud investigations, as an outside observer for Binance. This decision comes after Binance, the world's largest cryptocurrency exchange, was found guilty of violating US anti-money laundering regulations and trade sanctions.
FRA was selected from several top contenders, including the elite Wall Street law firm Sullivan & Cromwell, which was initially chosen. The selection process was secret and the Justice Department refused to comment on the matter.


The appointment of an external monitor was a condition of the plea deal Binance struck in November. In addition, Binance agreed to pay a hefty $4.3 billion fine. Binance founder Changpeng Zhao also pleaded guilty and agreed to resign as CEO. Zhao was sentenced to four months in prison on April 30.
As the designated monitor, FRA will be responsible for ensuring Binance complies with the plea agreement. This will include gaining access to Binance's internal records, facilities, and employees to report to the government on the company's activities.






FRA previously advised Geneva-based commodities company Gunvor SA as it negotiated a $660 million settlement with the Department of Justice over foreign bribery charges.
Sullivan & Cromwell, a firm approached by many Wall Street banks and executives, was the frontrunner to monitor Binance. However, controversy surrounding the firm's work for Binance's former rival FTX caused the government to choose a different direction.


Sullivan & Cromwell served as one of the firms working for FTX before its bankruptcy in November 2022. Following the bankruptcy, he became FTX's primary outside counsel and billed approximately $170 million for efforts to recover funds for FTX's creditors.

Traders shift gears to back BTC ETFs after a failed Bitcoin halving - Join the bandwagon?

Crypto traders are currently backing Bitcoin ETFs after BTC halving expectations fell through. In April, the crypto market had a rather uneventful month after a strong surge in the first quarter, which propelled Bitcoin (BTC) to reach a record-breaking high of $73,750.In the last month, as of May 10, 2024, BTC experienced a decline currently trading slightly above $60K. This crash can also be attributed to the increase in geopolitical tensions and wars. With the decentralized nature of cryptocurrencies, responses to geopolitical events are swift, surpassing the speed of stock reactions.Bitcoin adoption takes a different pathCurrently, the value of Bitcoin (BTC) stands at $60,325.53, reflecting a 1.0% decrease compared to an hour ago and a 2.7% decrease since yesterday. The current value of BTC is 2.5% lower than its value a week ago.In addition, the current global crypto market cap stands at $2.35 trillion, with a decrease of 2.27% in the last 24 hours and a significant increase of 97.31% compared to one year ago. Currently, BTC’s market cap stands at $1.19 Trillion, indicating a Bitcoin dominance of 50.56%. Meanwhile, the market cap of Stablecoins stands at $161 Billion, representing a 6.82% share of the overall crypto market cap.The Bitcoin halving event takes place every four years. After the recent completion of Bitcoin’s April halving, there is a lot of speculation about the potential price increase for the crypto in the coming months. This is mainly due to the decreased supply of Bitcoins, which could lead to increased scarcity.Since the introduction of the first Bitcoin ETFs on Jan 11, the asset has experienced a remarkable surge of over 50%, reaching a new all-time high of nearly $74,000. The ETFs are a significant development in Bitcoin’s trajectory, providing a regulated and convenient avenue for both retail and institutional investors to enter the crypto market. This development not only improves liquidity, but also helps maintain price stability.BTC ETFs market performanceBitcoin is frequently praised as a safeguard against inflation. Bitcoin has a limited supply. This move stands in stark contrast to traditional fiat currencies, which are subject to unlimited issuance by central banks. Therefore, during periods of inflation, the worth of fiat currencies typically decreases. Meanwhile, certain market observers regard Bitcoin as a valuable asset that can safeguard wealth in the face of rampant inflation, thanks to its finite supply. It is important to mention that the crypto space is highly unpredictable.Bitcoin ETFs have experienced a decline in investor interest in recent weeks. In the last ten days, there has been a noticeable trend of U.S. Bitcoin ETFs experiencing a total outflow of $230 million, as indicated by the data. Market participants, including Schiff, a Bitcoin critic, have expressed concerns about the potential negative impact of this trend on the price.In line with the economist’s perspective, Bitcoin ETFs experienced their biggest one-day outflow on May 1, as a substantial amount of $563.7 million was withdrawn. During this period, there was a simultaneous decrease in Bitcoin’s price, falling by 5% from $63,000 to below $60,000.The initial enthusiasm surrounding the launch of Bitcoin ETFs, which attracted a large number of buyers, has now transformed into a significant pool of potential sellers, as per Schiff. This has heightened the risk of further price declines.In addition, several other ETFs, including Ark 21shares (ARKB), WisdomTree’s BTCO, and Franklin Templeton’s EZBC, also saw positive movements. ARKB experienced $4.4 million in inflows, while BTCO and EZBC recorded $2.2 million and $1.8 million, respectively.Based on data from Coinglass, the recent drop in prices can be partially attributed to the rise in crypto liquidations, which amounted to $145M.

Crypto Analyst Says XRP Price Can Break Out From Falling Pennant, But Can It Reach $1?


																The XRP price, like the rest of the crypto industry, continues to struggle against the bearish winds that have taken over. This has seen its price consistently decline in spite of bulls’ best efforts to prop it up. However, it seems all hope is not lost for the altcoin as expectations are that it will recover soon enough. More specifically, crypto analyst WalterMoon is particularly bullish on the XRP price, noting that it is possible that it will break out of its current pennant.
Analyzing The XRP Price Movement
To try and pinpoint where the XRP price is headed, the crypto analyst first analyzed the movement of the altcoin over the last few weeks. This analysis showed a consistent breakout trend, albeit short-lived, that suggests that the altcoin could be getting ready to mount another one soon.

	Related Reading



One of these breakout trends took place last month in May when the price had entered a failing channel. Eventually, the XRP price was able to muster enough momentum, even after breaking below its support line below $0.5 and then made a run for $0.52.
Again, this is seen later in the month when the price once again fell into a falling channel. This decline saw it fall below support. But like the previous time, it was able to move upward inside this falling channel and eventually broke out of the channel.

Source: Tradingview.com
This trend was recorded a number of times in the month of May, showing XRP’s strength in the market right now. However, the altcoin has fallen inside another falling channel once again, but can it maintain its breakout trend from last month?
Gathering Support Inside A Pennant
Crypto analyst WalterMoon has identified the XRP price inside a falling channel and as it continues to decline inside this pennant, the price has taken hit after hit. But given the performance from the last month, Moon believes there is still upside to come for XRP.

	Related Reading



According to the analyst, there is a possibility that the altcoin can exit its current pennant by bouncing off the support at $0.533. In this case, it could send the price as high as $0.54, like it did the previous times. “Now, I think that Ripple can bounce up from support line to $0.5330, thereby exiting from pennant,” the analyst said.
Despite the bullish outlook, WalterMoon’s target is still conservative for all intents and purposes. The target still remains above the $0.54 level, which, unfortunately, doesn’t show much expectation for the XRP price to cross $1.

DOJ rejects Sullivan & Cromwell, picks FRA for Binance's monitorship - Crypto Briefing




The US Department of Justice (DOJ) has chosen Forensic Risk Alliance (FRA) for Binance’s three-year monitorship over initial favorite Sullivan & Cromwell (S&C), BNB Bloomberg reported today.This is a requirement of Binance’s November plea deal for violating money-laundering regulations and trade sanctions. Binance also agreed to a $4.3 billion penalty, and CEO Changpeng Zhao stepped down and received a four-month prison sentence.FRA’s role will involve scrutinizing Binance’s internal operations to ensure compliance and reporting findings to the government. The firm has a history of similar assignments, including consultancy for Gunvor SA during its $660 million settlement with the DOJ.The selection of FRA over Sullivan & Cromwell, a prestigious Wall Street law firm, marks a shift from the expected outcome. The firm was initially considered for the role but ultimately rejected. This is likely due to their past work on FTX, Binance’s rival crypto exchange that went bankrupt in November 2022.Sullivan & Cromwell has come under fire from FTX investors for its involvement with the company. A group of FTX investors, who initiated a lawsuit against the firm in February, claimed the firm knowingly provided services or assistance that directly enabled or facilitated FTX’s fraudulent activities.This week, FTX unveiled a new plan to pay out at least 118% of recognized claims to 98% of its creditors. The reorganization plan, subject to approval by the Bankruptcy Court, faced pushback from Sunil Kavuri, who represents the largest group of FTX creditors. He argued that repayments should reflect the current market prices of assets, not their value at the time of FTX’s bankruptcy.Kavuri also cited S&C’s previous relationship with the exchange. He opposes the inclusion of an exculpation clause that would protect S&C from lawsuits related to misconduct.The DOJ’s choice of FRA for the Binance monitorship has been welcomed by those affected by the FTX collapse, with Kavuri stating, “Truth prevails.”However, the report noted that S&C might still be appointed as a monitor for Binance by the Treasury Department’s Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN).

Sam Bankman-Fried Still Claims He’s Innocent From Prison - DailyCoin


        
SBF was convicted of multiple fraud charges and sentenced to 25 years in prison.



Shares a dormitory with 35 other inmates and subsists on rice and beans.



Plans to appeal his conviction, asserting his innocence.
Sam Bankman-Fried (SBF), the former CEO of FTX, became one of crypto’s most influential players. At the height of his career, he managed one of the world’s largest crypto exchanges, wielding considerable influence and capital. However, the collapse of FTX in 2022 led to his arrest and subsequent conviction on multiple charges of fraud, resulting in a 25-year prison sentence. In a recent interview from prison, SBF shed light on his life in prison, his ongoing legal battle, and the events that led to FTX’s downfall.SBF Subsists on Prison Rice and Beans, Plays VideogamesCurrently detained at MDC Brooklyn where he serves his prison sentence, SBF shares a dormitory with 35 other inmates and survives primarily on rice and beans from the prison commissary. He has adjusted to prison life by watching movies, playing video games, and avoiding the prison’s poor-quality vegan entrees. 
While Sam Bankman-Fried claims to be managing well in prison, he acknowledges the difficulties of life at the Metropolitan Detention Center. The prison’s dormitory-style setup leaves little privacy, with prisoners often bartering for commodities like rice. Although he has regular access to his prescription medications and legal team, he remains unsure about his long-term placement. His family and legal advisors are concerned about his potential transfer to a federal penitentiary, which could subject him to a months-long journey across the U.S. on a prison bus.SBF Still Believes He Could Have Saved FTXIn the 75-minute prison interview, SBF reiterated that he didn’t commit any crimes, blaming FTX’s bankruptcy on a combination of market conditions and poor legal advice. 
He argued that the primary reason for the collapse was a liquidity crunch exacerbated by a bank run and the actions of competitors. He also said that he still believes that the company could have avoided bankruptcy if he was still in control. SBF also acknowledged mistakes in the management of Alameda Research. He claimed that he asked Caroline Ellison to lead Alameda after pressure from lawyers, who warned him about conflicts of interest in leading the two firms. For that reason, he regretted not finding a different executive for the role but maintained that he didn’t knowingly engage in fraudulent activities.SBF Still Plans to Appeal His SentenceThe former FTX CEO still believes he can challenge the sentence, which he argues was based on incomplete information and a rushed bankruptcy filing. He believes that Sullivan & Cromwell, FTX’s outside counsel, had undue influence over the proceedings and led prosecutors to target him unfairly. His conviction is currently under appeal, with his legal team preparing to file their brief in the coming months.Bankman-Fried was arrested on December 12, 2022, in the Bahamas and extradited to the United States to face charges of wire fraud, conspiracy, and other financial crimes. Following a highly publicized trial, he was sentenced to 25 years in prison in March 2024, after being found guilty of siphoning off customer funds to his trading firm, Alameda Research.On the Flipside
FTX is currently auctioning off its assets to repay creditors and users of the platform. This includes billions in Solana tokens, of which FTX was a major investor. 



Following the FTX collapse, SBF became one of the most hated people in crypto. His actions also resulted in regulatory pressures on the industry across the globe, as governments hastened to prevent a repeat of the collapse.

New Development in the SEC-Coinbase Case that Will Determine the Fate of Cryptocurrencies in the US - Bitcoin Sistemi


The US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) asked the court to reject cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase's appeal, stating that “there is no significant basis for disagreement.”
Coinbase last month filed a temporary appeal following a judge's decision to allow a lawsuit involving the SEC and Coinbase to proceed without dismissal.


The appeal was based on differing interpretations of the Howey Test, a 1946 U.S. Supreme Court case frequently used by the SEC to determine whether an asset qualifies as an investment contract and therefore a security.
Coinbase's dislike of the Howey Test and the current framework for securities regulation does not provide a compelling reason to prematurely approve an appeal in this case, the SEC said in a statement today. The SEC also stated that Coinbase's decision to regulate its business in ways that could make it costly to comply with existing laws and its desire to rewrite decades of established legal precedent to suit its policy goals and business needs are not valid grounds for an appeal.






The SEC also noted, however, that an appeal filed before a case is concluded is unlikely to be granted. The failure of the SEC's appeal in the case it filed against Ripple last year was also an indication of this.
In her decision to proceed with the case, Judge Katherine Polk Failla disagreed with Coinbase's argument that investment agreements need a formal contract. He noted that when a customer purchases a token from Coinbase, they are not just purchasing a token, they are also purchasing that “token's digital ecosystem.”


In order for Coinbase's appeal to proceed, Judge Failla must grant leave to appeal. If the appeal is allowed to proceed, the remainder of the case will be put on hold in the trial court and the exchange will then await a decision from the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit.

                        Bitcoin (BTC) is rapidly evolving. While the Bitcoin network has primarily been used for payment transactions, current activity appears to be resembling that of Ethereum during the height of decentralized application (Dapp) projects. The introduction of Bitcoin Runes and BRC-20 tokens  – which emerged during the time of the fourth Bitcoin halving event – has likely sparked the evolution of Bitcoin-native decentralized finance (DeFi).The Emergence of Bitcoin DeFi 
Rena Shah, VP of Products at Trust Machines – a team focused on growing the Bitcoin economy – told Cryptonews that two years ago, Bitcoin DeFi wasn’t a narrative the ecosystem was discussing. Yet Shah noted that the emergence of staking platforms and lending protocols across the Bitcoin network has created interest among investors in transitioning assets from a store of value to a source of value. “The desire to go from a passive to a productive Bitcoin asset is real in 2024,” she said. “We have been building towards this future because we can see that Bitcoin DeFi is appealing not just to retail investors but also to institutional investors.”Institutions Will Show Interest in Bitcoin DeFi
Data from DeFiLlama shows that Bitcoin’s total value locked (TVL) is roughly $1.2 billion. Yet, according to Shah, nearly $1 trillion in capital is locked on the Bitcoin blockchain.“Even the smallest percentages of capital becoming productive in DeFi will make huge waves in the Bitcoin ecosystem,” Shah pointed out. This, along with the recent approval of spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) in the United States, is increasing the potential for Bitcoin DeFi applications. In particular, this will likely appeal to institutions holding Bitcoin and retail investors. Tycho Onnasch, the co-founder of Zest Protocol, told Cryptonews that he believes BTC is a more institutional asset than the rest of crypto. “Hence, I expect institutions to play a larger part in using and bootstrapping Bitcoin DeFi,” said Onnasch. Bitcoin DeFi Applications For Institutions 
Although Bitcoin DeFi is still a relatively new concept, a number of projects seek to enable and advance the sector.For example, Onnasch explained that Zest Protocol is creating a lending protocol built specifically for Bitcoin. He mentioned that the goal behind the platform is to create a permissionless financial infrastructure for BTC lending markets.“Zest enables users to collateralize BTC to borrow other tokens such as stablecoins,” he said. “The platform also lets users earn yield on their BTC.” Indeed, the primary use case behind Bitcoin DeFi applications seems to be ensuring that Bitcoin becomes a more productive asset for investors.Dr. Chiente Hsu, Co-Founder of ALEX and XLink, told Cryptonews that Alex is a new finance layer for the Bitcoin network. “Our goal is to seamlessly integrate Bitcoin with layer-2 (L2) solutions and the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) world,” said Hsu. “This will allow us to expand the Bitcoin economy,” said Hsu.For instance, Hsu explained that investors can earn yield on their BTC by connecting a Bitcoin wallet to XLink. He noted that XLink is powered by ALEX’s automated market maker (AMM) and decentralized exchange (DEX). This will allow cross-chain swaps between Bitcoin L2s and the EVM world. “Bitcoin DeFi for institutions will be the pursuit of Bitcoin yield generating assets,” said Hsu. Hsu believes this will likely be the case due to the large amount of capital on the Bitcoin network.“There’s well over $1 trillion in Bitcoin capital that is ‘idle’ in the sense that its value rises and falls relative to the Bitcoin spot price,” he said. “But unlike Ethereum, Bitcoin can’t be natively locked to generate a yield. This is a solution that ALEX is actively pursuing, which will enable institutions that hold Bitcoin to earn yield through their Bitcoin capital.”Bitcoin DeFi Resembles Ethereum Counterparts
Another interesting point is that while Bitcoin DeFi is unique, applications tend to resemble DeFi projects on Ethereum (ETH). This is important to consider, as institutions have started to show interest in many current DeFi applications. Digital asset management firm Fireblocks recently found increased institutional DeFi activity on the Fireblocks platform. According to the firm, there was a 75% jump in the first quarter of 2024. Fireblocks reported that some of the most popular Dapps that institutional customers interact with across swapping, lending, staking, and bridging include Uniswap, Aave, Curve, 1inch, and Jupiter. Jeff Yin, CEO of Merlin Chain – a Bitcoin L2 facilitating fast, cost-effective transactions with support for BTC Dapps – told Cryptonews that DEXs, derivatives, and lending are all areas where BTC has learned extensively from ETH. He added that many new protocols are emerging. “For example, ‘Surf’ is a derivatives trading protocol that launched on Merlin Chain and now boasts a daily trading volume of over $10 million. These are similar to their Ethereum counterparts,” said Yin. Yin elaborated that a specific Bitcoin DeFi application would replicate one of the largest ETH DeFi protocols, Lido – which holds $28 billion and accounts for half of Ethereum’s DeFi TVL. “SolvBTC is currently developing an underlying BTC yield protocol,” said Yin. “Additionally, Unicross has implemented a Rune trading protocol on a BTC L2, allowing users to trade Layer 1 (L1) assets more cheaply on L2. These represent the more innovative aspects of the sector.” Bitcoin DeFi May Overtake Ethereum 
While Bitcoin DeFi may appear similar to Ethereum, Shah believes that decentralized finance using BTC may eventually surpass Ethereum. “Looking at DappRadar, Ethereum has over 600 active apps with varying volume and activity,” said Shah. “I have no reason to expect that Bitcoin DeFi cannot match Ethereum, and eventually flip it for Dapps in the ecosystem.”Certain solutions are also making it easier to bring Ethereum Dapps to Bitcoin. Zack Voell, Director of Marketing at Botanix Labs, told Cryptonews that Botanix had created a “Spiderchain” that easily enables DeFi on Bitcoin. “Spiderchain creates a fully EVM-equivalent environment for Dapps and smart contracts on Ethereum to be copy-pasted to run natively on Bitcoin,” said Voell. “Botanix Labs is building the Spiderchain to combine the two most Lindy technologies in crypto — the EVM and Bitcoin — instead of trying to reinvent a completely new protocol or virtual machine.”Challenges May Slow Adoption 
Although it’s too soon to determine the fate of Bitcoin DeFi, certain challenges may slow adoption. For instance, Yin pointed out that liquidity fragmentation often results from the difficulty of implementing DeFi on an L1 network. This, in turn, forces most activities to disperse across various L2 solutions, yet Yin noted that this may make it difficult to concentrate liquidity. “A potential solution could be to create omnichain liquidity, similar to the Stone protocol in the Ethereum ecosystem,” he said. “We look forward to future implementations like M-STONEBTC and Solv Protocol that could unify BTC L2 liquidity.”Additionally, Shah mentioned that Bitcoin’s challenge is keeping the base layer secure, stable, and untampered. “That is where scaling becomes paramount,” she said. “A healthy and diverse L2 ecosystem will be what ultimately drives Bitcoin DeFi, as a vertical, to succeed.”Shah added that programming environments on Bitcoin are inherently difficult since many developers from other ecosystems are less familiar with Bitcoin script. She noted that one way to combat this is to create WebAssembly (WASM) or different run-time environments like Rust, Solidity, and Cosmos with L2s. “This approach will likely help bring new developers into the ecosystem,” she remarked.

PEPE to hit new ATH? YES, but only if these conditions are met... - AMBCrypto



Memecoin’s price climbed by over 6% in the last 24 hours 
Technical indicators suggested a sustained bull rally may be possible

PEPE has showcased some impressive performance over the last few days, with the altcoin now steadily closing in on its all-time high. Does this mean the memecoin will soon breach its old ATH though? Well, let’s have a look at PEPE’s current state to see whether that’s a viable possibility. 
PEPE bulls are pushing hard
Investors enjoyed profits last week as PEPE’s price surged by more than 10%. In fact, according to CoinMarketCap, in the last 24 hours alone, the memecoin’s value appreciated by over 6.5%. 
And yet, bullish sentiment around the memecoin declined slightly – With the same evidenced by the drop in its weighted sentiment.
Source: Santiment
However, according to one analysis, the drop in investors’ confidence might not affect PEPE adversely yet. Plazma, a popular crypto-analyst, is of this view, with the analyst tweeting that the memecoin is set to test its ATH. 
To see whether that’s possible, AMBCrypto analyzed PEPE’s on-chain metrics. As per our analysis of Santiment’s data, PEPE’s MVRV ratio had a value of 16.26%. Whale activity around the memecoin was also high last week. 
Following a deeper look at the same, we found that the memecoin’s supply held by top addresses hiked too. This clearly meant that whales were buying PEPE – A sign that they expect the memecoin’s price to surge in the coming days. 
Source: Santiment
PEPE to hit new highs soon?
AMBCrypto then checked the memecoin’s daily chart to see how likely it is for the coin to touch its ATH again. 
The MACD projected a bullish advantage in the market, while the Relative Strength Index (RSI) was resting above neutral. Additionally, the Bollinger Bands implied that PEPE’s price was well above its 20-day Simple Moving Average (SMA), meaning a sustained rally would be possible. 
Source: TradingView
To see whether there were any other resistance zones before the ATH, we then took a look at Hyblock Capital’s data. We found that PEPE’s liquidation would rise sharply near the $0.00000928-mark. A rise in liquidations often results in price corrections. 
Therefore, it’ll be crucial for the memecoin to go above that level. A successful breakout above it would clear its path towards testing its ATH.

However, nothing can be said with certainty, as IntoTheBlock’s data revealed that only 1% of PEPE investors are out of money right now. This can motivate investors to sell their holdings. This can also increase selling pressure and in turn, put an end to the memecoin’s rally.

Crypto Nonprofit To Support Industry-Friendly Candidates


								The November US elections could become a major event for the crypto industry as the government’s crackdown on the sector has created an unclear and uncertain landscape for investors and businesses.
As such, voters and crucial figures are taking presidential and congressional candidates’ stances on the sector as a defining factor to consider. Recent reports revealed a nonprofit organization has launched a new Political Action Committee (PAC) to support industry-friendly politicians running for Congress.

Raising Funds For Pro-Crypto Candidates
On Friday, Reuters reported on Stand With Crypto’s newly launched project to raise money to endorse crypto-friendly politicians running for this November elections.
Stand With Crypto is an advocacy group started by Coinbase in 2023 and operates as a 501(c)(4) nonprofit, according to its website. The organization has nearly 450,000 members and “champions for clear, common-sense regulations for the crypto industry.”
Stand With Crypto’s PAC seeks to raise money for a bipartisan slate of candidates running in the House of Representatives and the Senate and put those who support cryptocurrencies and blockchain in office.
Nick Carr, the chief strategist of the nonprofit organization, told Reuters “The goal is to endorse candidates and support candidates that are protecting the rights of our advocates (…) throughout November.”
The PAC’s endorsements include Jim Banks, a Republican running for Senate in Indiana; Jim Justice, a Republican running for Senate in West Virginia; Troy Downing, a Republican running to represent Montana’s Second District; Shomari Figures, a Democrat running to represent Alabama’s Second District; and Eddy Morales, a Democrat running to represent Oregon’s Third District.
According to the news outlet, other crypto super PACs like Fairshake, Defend American Jobs and Protect Progress have raised more than $110 million during this election cycle. Supper PACs differentiate from Stand With Crypto’s PAC because they can receive unlimited-sized donations but can’t coordinate with campaigns directly.
A recent report by Public Citizen found that over half the money raised by most of these super PACs comes directly from corporate expenditures like Coinbase and Ripple Labs. The rest of the funds have been donations from billionaire executives and venture capitalists, including founders of VC firm Andreessen Horowitz, the Winklevoss twins, and Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong.
Industry’s Role In Politics
Super PACs like Defend American Jobs claim that the industry already plays a role in this election cycle. The organization felt victorious after four endorsed candidates won the Indiana primaries on Tuesday, including Jim Banks, and Mark Messmer, a Republican running to represent the state’s Eighth District.
However, the industry’s involvement in this electoral campaign has faced some scrutiny by US regulators. During FTX founder Sam Bankman-Fried trial, prosecutors alleged that SBF had used his customers’ funds to donate over $100 million to US political campaigns, which raised concerns.
Despite this, crucial figures in the industry continue to advocate for a clearer and more friendly regulatory framework in the country. The US House of Representatives recently passed a bill to the Senate to nullify some policies by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).
Ultimately, politicians have greatly criticized the SEC’s “overreaching” actions against the crypto industry. US Senator Cynthia Lummis and Chair of the Financial Services Committee Chairman Patrick McHenry have expressed their concerns about the regulator’s “unnecessary” crackdown on the sector on different occasions, calling for a better and less aggressive landscape in the US.

Change Of Heart: Crypto Scammer Returns $34.7 Million To Victim


																A week ago, a crypto whale fell victim to a scam that resulted in the loss of over $71 million. In the following days, the scammer moved the funds to veil them. But in a shocking turn of events, they returned the funds to the victim.

Address Poisoning Scam Snatches $71 Million
On May 3, whale 0x1E22…8FD5 lost 1,155 Wrapped Bitcoin (WBTC), worth around $71.31 million, after falling victim to an address poisoning scam. This scam, also known as address spoofing, consists of trying to trick users into sending funds to fraudulent lookalike accounts.


The “vanity addresses” are custom-made with specific characters that look like the intended recipient’s address. Scammers send transactions of no value, hoping the similarity between the addresses will fool the user under attack.
If successful, victims copy the fraudulent address from the previous transactions and accidentally send their assets to the scammers instead.
PeckShieldAlert reported that the phisher immediately swapped the stolen WBTC for 23,000 Ether (ETH) before transferring them to a different address. Throughout the following days, the scammer laundered the funds. Sending them to ten different addresses before distributing the tokens through over 100 other addresses.
This development painted a looming picture for the crypto whale. At this point, the funds appeared to be unrecoverable. One user called the massive number of transfers a “crypto musical chairs” game.
Others justified the scammer, claiming he had not stolen the funds, as “he just received them.” This stance disregards the transaction’s nature. The transfer occurs under the belief that funds are safely being transferred to the intended account and not a lookalike.
Moreover, the lookalike address is in the victim’s transaction history, clearly intended to deceive the user into receiving funds not meant for them.
Change Of Heart Or Scared Of The Crypto Community?
In a shocking turn of events, the scammer sent 51 ETH, worth around $153,000, back to the victim on Thursday. Alongside the funds, the phisher sent a message asking to contact the whale, seemingly looking to negotiate.
The reasons behind the sudden change of heart remain a mystery to the community. Many are jokingly theorizing why the scammer returned the funds. One X user playfully suggested that the phisher feared being investigated by crypto sleuth ZachXBT.
Others claimed that “even the scammer doesn’t want ETH,” referencing the criticism the second-largest cryptocurrency has faced after its performance during this cycle.
In the early hours of Friday, PeckShieldAlert revealed that 2,683.7 ETH, worth about $8 million, had already been transferred to the whale from nearly 50 different addresses. A couple of hours later, an update showcased that around 50% of the total funds had been returned, accounting for 11,446.87 ETH, or $34.7 million.

Retrieving all the assets might take time due to the large number of addresses holding the funds. At the time of writing, over $45 million worth of ETH has already been returned, and the transactions continue.

Crypto Biz: SEC targets Robinhood, Grayscale’s Ethereum ETFs, and more

Another Wells notice has hit the crypto industry as the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) intensifies its scrutiny, targeting Robinhood. The popular trading platform received the notice on May 4, signaling potential enforcement action over alleged securities violations related to cryptocurrency listings and custodian operations. Like other crypto firms that have received similar notices from the agency — including Coinbase, Kraken and Uniswap — Robinhood has promised to fight any SEC action while complaining about the lack of federal guidance. Meanwhile, Grayscale withdrew its application for an Ether (ETH) futures exchange-traded fund (ETF) just three weeks before the SEC is set to make a decision, and crypto exchange Coincheck is on its way to becoming a Nasdaq-listed company. Along with Robinhood’s Wells notice and Grayscale’s Ether ETF applications, this week’s Crypto Biz features Coincheck’s merger deal and Block’s billionaire debt offering. Robinhood crypto business slapped with SEC Wells noticeThe U.S. SEC issued a Wells notice to Robinhood on May 4, signaling potential enforcement action over alleged securities violations. According to a regulatory filing, the SEC has been investigating the platform’s cryptocurrency listings and custodian operations despite Robinhood’s attempts to comply with regulations — including avoiding the listing of certain tokens or providing crypto lending and staking services. Robinhood criticized a lack of regulatory clarity at the federal level, claiming that this complicates compliance and hinders broader crypto adoption. Grayscale withdraws its Ethereum futures ETF applicationGrayscale has withdrawn its 19b-4 application for an Ether futures ETF just three weeks before the SEC was scheduled to decide on it. The cryptocurrency asset manager filed a notice of withdrawal for the Grayscale Ethereum Futures Trust with the SEC on May 7. The Ether futures ETF was initially filed on Sept. 19, 2023, and if it were approved, it would have been listed on the New York Stock Exchange. Bloomberg analyst James Seyffart previously suggested that Grayscale intended to use the ETF as a “trojan horse” to pressure the SEC into approving its spot Ether ETF.Deadlines for the spot Ether ETF applications before the SEC.

According to a May 7 press release, the companies filed a Form F-4 registration statement with the U.S. SEC, marking a milestone in their two-year journey toward a public offering. Initially disclosed in March 2022, the proposed business combination aims to make Coincheck a publicly traded entity through a de-SPAC transaction with Thunder Bridge. Originally valued at $1.25 billion, the merger completion was delayed by the severe bear market and regulatory uncertainties following the collapse of FTX. The transaction is now expected to be completed in the second or third quarter of 2024.Jack Dorsey’s Block to raise $1.5 billion in senior notes offeringJack Dorsey’s fintech firm Block has announced a plan to raise at least $1.5 billion through a private offering of senior notes.

                        Bitcoin Price PredictionToday, Bitcoin is trading at $60,620, marking a 4% decrease over the last 24 hours. The cryptocurrency’s recent uplift is attributed to dovish economic data from the U.S., hinting at possible Federal Reserve rate cuts.This anticipation has weakened the dollar and, in turn, boosted Bitcoin’s value. Additionally, significant inflows of $11.54 million into Bitcoin ETFs, like Grayscale and Bitwise, along with Trump’s positive remarks on cryptocurrencies, have further fueled the upward movement.Rising US Jobless Claims Boost Crypto Market Amid Rate Cut Hopes
The latest US employment data reveals a slowing labour market, stirring optimism within the cryptocurrency sector. Recently, the US Bureau of Labor Statistics reported that initial jobless claims rose unexpectedly to 231,000 for the week ending May 3, significantly higher than the anticipated 210,000. This uptick suggests a softening job market, which might prompt the Federal Reserve to consider rate cuts sooner than anticipated—a scenario that typically benefits cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin. Investors are now keenly awaiting further economic reports, such as the Consumer Price Index (CPI) and Producer Price Index (PPI), to gauge future monetary policy directions. This expectation fosters a bullish outlook for cryptocurrencies.
Unexpected Rise: Jobless claims hit 231,000, hinting at a softening job market.

Jack Dorsey, the co-founder and former CEO of Twitter, has made a bold prediction that Bitcoin will reach at least $1 million by 2030. This forecast coincides with his recent departure from the decentralized platform BlueSky, motivated by shifts away from its original vision of true decentralization.Simultaneously, Dorsey’s fintech enterprise, Block, faces regulatory scrutiny, impacting its services like Square and Cash App. Despite these challenges, Bitcoin shows robustness in the market, maintaining a price of around $61,000. While Dorsey remains optimistic about Bitcoin’s potential, the ongoing regulatory pressures and market uncertainties continue to pose significant challenges.
Bold Prediction: Jack Dorsey foresees Bitcoin reaching $1 million by 2030.
Regulatory Scrutiny: Block, including Square and Cash App, under compliance review.
Today, Bitcoin is priced at $60,620, witnessing a decline of around 4% within the last 24 hours. Bitcoin price prediction seems bearish as BTC is holding below $60,975. Above this pivot, immediate resistance levels are observed at $63,400, followed by $65,050, and extending to $67,160, which may challenge further upward movements.Conversely, support levels are marked distinctly, beginning at $59,075 and subsequent support at $56,640 and $54,400.Bitcoin Price PredictionTechnical indicators reflect a cautious outlook; the Relative Strength Index (RSI) stands at 38, indicating a potential overselling scenario. The 50-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA) is positioned at $62,325, providing a reference point for current price actions.Bitcoin’s recent market behaviour shows a bearish engulfing pattern on the 4-hour chart, breaching the upward trendline at $60,975. This breakdown suggests potential downward pressure, targeting the immediate support level at $59,075.Conclusion: Bitcoin’s current market stance is bearish, below the $60,975 threshold. A decisive move above this level could, however, pivot towards a bullish trend.

Based on What Does the Bitcoin Price Go Up and Down? When Will It Rise? Analyst Reveals His Expectation - Bitcoin Sistemi

The direction of Bitcoin price is once again in the hands of the Federal Reserve, according to a new analysis. This comes after excitement around Bitcoin ETFs faded.
Bitcoin's price movements are being driven by broader conversations about interest rates, CoinShares, a European digital asset manager, said in a report published today.


“A closer examination of the last 40 trading days reveals increasing alignment with interest rate expectations for June,” wrote CoinShares Research Manager James Butterfill. He noted that a similar trend was observed in 2023.
According to CME Fedwatch, the market is confident that interest rates will remain stable in June, with a potential decline only in the 4th quarter of this year. Core Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) inflation, which excludes food and fuel, the Fed's preferred inflation measure, remained stubbornly flat at 2.8% in March, well above expectations.





On the other hand, GDP growth figures were disappointing, recorded at 1.6% in the first quarter of 2024, compared to 3.4% in the previous quarter.
The data also shows that growth in the manufacturing and service sectors contracted and stagnated, respectively. These measurements are fueling fears of stagflation and raising expectations that the Fed will keep interest rates higher for longer. In response, Bitcoin's price dropped below $57,000 heading into the Fed's next meeting on May 1, CoinShares explains.



However, the central bank also announced a “dovish surprise” with plans to reduce quantitative tightening (QT) while maintaining the policy rate above 5.25%. That means slowing the pace at which the economy shrinks its dollar supply by reducing its balance sheet by $25 billion a month instead of the previous rate of $60 billion.
In theory, this is good for Bitcoin and other risky assets that have previously thrived in easy-money macro environments, according to the analyst. Bitcoin's price rose above $60,000 shortly after the Fed's announcement.





“Tightening the QT while simultaneously keeping front-end rates high can be likened to both braking and accelerating a car,” Butterfill wrote. Butterfill added that the US Treasury may be reaching its limit in paying its short-term debts and that a change in the FED's QT strategy is the only remaining option.
Butterfill expects the Fed to cut interest rates later this year in response to weakening economic data, and that the cut will likely be “later but larger than expected.” The analyst said the following about BTC:

“Thanks to Bitcoin's fixed supply and high immutability, when the Fed eventually lowers interest rates, this turbulent situation is likely to support Bitcoin prices.”

SEC asks court to deny Coinbase’s motion for interlocutory appeal - Blockworks


The Securities and Exchange Commission asked a court to deny Coinbase’s motion for an interlocutory appeal on Friday. 
The regulatory agency and the crypto exchange have been locked in a legal battle for nearly a year after the agency charged Coinbase with operating as an unregistered exchange and alleged that its Staking program was violating securities laws.
“Interlocutory review is not warranted simply because Coinbase proposes a new legal test and disagrees with the Court’s rejection of that test, nor can it be supported by Coinbase’s desire for quicker appellate review of its invented test,” the SEC said in the filing. 
The SEC further argued that there’s no “substantial ground for difference of opinion,” because that would mean there is more than the obvious disagreement between the two parties. Coinbase, the SEC said, has yet to create “substantial doubt” about the court’s ruling.
“It is also possible that Coinbase simply does not like the answer provided for years now by the SEC and the courts, having decided to structure its business in ways that now may make it difficult or costly to comply with the securities framework put in place by Congress and the SEC over our capital markets for nearly a century,” the SEC wrote. 
Read more: Court largely rules against Coinbase’s dismissal efforts in SEC case
“But Coinbase’s desire to change the rules, to do so quickly, and to enlist the federal judiciary in this endeavor, supply no basis to certify an appeal,” the filing continued.
The SEC’s response comes after Coinbase filed for an interlocutory appeal last month. Coinbase wanted a higher court to review whether or not the SEC can apply Howey to crypto transactions. 
The company noted that the amount of differing opinions — from regulators to politicians on Capitol Hill — shows the “difficulty of the subject matter.”
Coinbase and the SEC have been engaged in multiple legal battles since last year after the SEC served the former with a Wells notice last March. Coinbase took to the courts afterward, asking for answers from the regulator. Then, in June, the SEC filed its suit. 
Last December, the SEC denied Coinbase’s rulemaking petition, which it filed in 2022. The petition asked the regulator to create rules for crypto and argued that the current securities laws don’t work for the blossoming industry. The SEC, notably, had made the opposite claim and it shows through its regulation-by-enforcement approach under Chair Gary Gensler. 
Read more: Coinbase says it will challenge SEC crypto rulemaking rejection
Coinbase, in a ruling last month, was mostly denied its motion to dismiss. However, the court found that the SEC’s claims against its wallet service — the SEC alleged that it acted as an unregistered broker by offering the service — were unfounded. 
“The factual allegations concerning Wallet are insufficient to support the plausible inference that Coinbase ‘engaged in the business of effecting transactions in securities for the account of others’ through its Wallet application,” Judge Katherine Polk Failla wrote.
Failla said that the SEC could move forward with its claims against the Staking service and Coinbase’s role as an unregistered exchange. The SEC, she said, “plausibly alleged” that Coinbase violated parts of the security act. 
The reasoning, she said, is because Coinbase’s “managerial effort” could meet Howey’s standards, which would make it a security offering.
Coinbase didn’t immediately return a request for comment.

Bitcoin's surge turns out to be short-lived - What to think | Cryptopolitan

The recent uptick in Bitcoin’s value proved fleeting, as a cocktail of economic factors and cautious statements from U.S. Federal Reserve officials drove the price down sharply in just a matter of hours. This sudden dip not only highlighted Bitcoin’s sensitivity to external economic indicators but also tempered the optimism that had recently buoyed the cryptocurrency market.Market Reactions to Economic IndicatorsFriday morning witnessed a significant decline in Bitcoin prices, plunging from a promising high of $63,500 to a lower stance at around $60,700. This drop coincided with the release of lackluster U.S. economic data and hawkish commentary from Dallas Fed President Lori Logan. The University of Michigan’s Consumer Sentiment Survey for May reported a stark decline to 67.4 from 77.2 the previous month, missing expectations by a wide margin and signaling growing consumer apprehension.Moreover, inflation expectations for the coming year edged up to 3.5% from 3.2%, contradicting forecasts and recent dismissive remarks regarding stagflation by Fed Chair Jerome Powell. This shift in sentiment is crucial as it reflects a growing concern among consumers about the potential for ongoing economic instability.The impact of these developments was felt not just in the cryptocurrency sphere but also saw the U.S. dollar and bond yields experience modest gains. Interestingly, while traditional stock markets showed little reaction, Bitcoin’s price trajectory starkly deviated, highlighting its volatile nature in response to macroeconomic shifts.Long-Term Outlook Amid Short-Term FluctuationsDespite the immediate setbacks, the broader outlook for Bitcoin by analysts remains tentatively optimistic, albeit cautious in the short term. The introduction of U.S. Bitcoin ETFs earlier in the year and the effects of the April 19 Bitcoin halving contributed to a major year-to-date increase of 48%. However, the second quarter painted a bleaker picture, with an 11% decline, a departure from its peak in March.Experts like H.C. Wainwright analyst Mike Colonnese have suggested that it might take several months for Bitcoin to revisit its recent highs. In the interim, the market may see further corrections, which are not uncommon even during bull cycles, with retracements between 25% and 30% considered normal. These corrections are viewed as temporary setbacks within the framework of a longer bullish trajectory.The potential for a downturn to the mid $50,000 range was noted, driven by persistent high inflation and slower economic growth. This outlook places a spotlight on the inherent risks and the necessity for investor patience and strategic flexibility in response to evolving market conditions.Bitcoin’s sensitivity to shifts in economic indicators and Federal Reserve policies highlights its unique position within financial markets. As it stands, Bitcoin continues to offer high beta exposure, making it a potent but risky asset for investors seeking to leverage its high volatility.In this current cycle, despite the recent price dips, the reduced supply from the halving and increased demand from new financial products like ETFs enhance Bitcoin’s supply-demand dynamics, potentially setting the stage for future value increases.

SEC's Gensler Under Fire as Emmer Launches Crypto Defense - DailyCoin


        
The U.S. crypto industry faces hostility under Gensler’s SEC.



Congressman Tom Emmer supported proposals to reform the agency.



Crypto regulation is a divisive issue.
The Securities Exchange Commission (SEC) under Gary Gensler has left little doubt about its intent to exercise control the U.S. crypto industry. The latest anti-crypto actions perpetrated by the agency include sending Robinhood a Wells Notice and objecting to Ripple’s stablecoin plans. 
Stepping in to bring the SEC to account, Congressman Tom Emmer has lent his support to a trio of bills aimed at reforming the SEC, stating the agency has wandered far off its path.SEC and Gensler PannedWading into the “war on crypto,” Emmer blasted the SEC under Gensler for straying from its core mission, announcing his co-sponsorship of three legislative proposals to bring reform and oversight to the agency. The bills, authored by Congresswoman Ann Wagner, aim to rein in the SEC’s overreach and lack of accountability.In unveiling the bills, Emmer accused the agency of abandoning its “statutory mission to protect investors, maintain fair, orderly, and efficient markets, and facilitate capital formation.” He insisted the reforms, if passed, would “force the SEC to get back on track” with its mandates.While some believe the solution for SEC hostility lies in “regulating the regulators,” the broader issue of crypto oversight remains a major partisan flashpoint in Congress.Crypto Remains DivisiveCrypto regulation remains a hugely divisive, partisan issue on Capitol Hill, making legislative proposals to reform the SEC’s oversight a highly contentious issue. Although presidential hopeful Donald Trump lent his support to the U.S. crypto industry recently, there are many Republicans, including Senator Mike Rounds, who strongly oppose digital assets, as well as supportive Democrats.
Nonetheless, Joe Biden’s veto of the recently passed H.J. Res. 109, which repealed an SEC policy preventing regulated entities from custodying crypto assets, demonstrated where the White House stands with cryptocurrency.With presidential backing under the current administration, the odds of SEC reform remain uncertain.  On the Flipside
Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong believes the path to correcting regulatory hostility lies in supporting pro-crypto politicians.



The feedback to Emmer‘s message was mixed, with some replies accusing the congressman of having vested interests.
Why This MattersEmmer is attempting to hold Gensler and the SEC accountable for overstepping its mandate at the expense of an emerging industry. Whether there is the political will to make this happen is another matter.The SEC pulled approval for Exodus’ stock listing at the last minute.SEC Scuppers Exodus’ Stock Debut in Sudden U-TurnBitcoin miners face short-term uncertainty as mining revenue plummets.Bitcoin Difficulty Sinks as Miners Mull Post-Halving Perks

Crypto exchanges Binance and KuCoin secure registration with India's FIU - CoinJournal



                    

                    
Binance and KuCoin has obtain FIU-IND approval, marking a milestone in Indian crypto regulation.
KuCoin pays $41,000 penalty as Binance awaits fine determination amid compliance proceedings.
The return of the exchanges to India signals the growing acceptance of cryptocurrencies in India’s regulatory framework.

In a significant development for the cryptocurrency industry In India, two major exchanges, Binance and KuCoin, have obtained registration approval from India’s Financial Intelligence Unit (FIU-IND), marking a pivotal moment in their journey toward regulatory compliance in the country.
This comes after months of negotiations and challenges following the ban of the two exchanges for alleged illegal operations.
Binance and Kucoin to re-enter India after ban
The path to registration was fraught with obstacles, as both Binance and KuCoin, along with several other offshore entities, faced a ban in December of the previous year for non-compliance with Indian regulations.
The ban, enforced by the Indian Finance Ministry, led to the blocking of URLs and mobile applications associated with these exchanges in January 2024. However, despite these setbacks, Binance and KuCoin emerged as the first offshore crypto-related entities to secure registration with the FIU-IND.
KuCoin took proactive steps by paying a penalty of $41,000, allowing it to resume operations in India swiftly. On the other hand, Binance’s compliance proceedings are still ongoing, with the exact penalty yet to be determined after a hearing with the FIU-IND. Reports suggest that Binance might face a fine of up to $2 million for non-compliance, highlighting the seriousness of regulatory infractions in the Indian crypto market.
Has India’s perception of crypto changed?
The approval of Binance and KuCoin signifies a shift in the perception of crypto exchanges in India and adds credibility to the regulatory framework governing the industry.
Vivek Aggarwal, the head of FIU-IND, emphasized the importance of these registrations in safeguarding the Indian economy against financial crimes. He stated that while the industry awaits parliamentary and governmental legitimacy, registered entities inherently possess a degree of credibility within the system.
India’s position on crypto has been somewhat ambiguous, with the imposition of stiff taxes and periodic crackdowns on offshore exchanges. However, the country’s push for global consensus on crypto regulation within the G20 framework reflects a proactive approach toward addressing regulatory challenges at the international level.
However, despite the challenges, India’s crypto industry continues to evolve, with efforts underway to foster a regulatory environment that balances innovation with financial security. The unveiling of a report titled “Virtual Digital Asset Service Providers: Road to Effective Compliance under PMLA” by the Bharat Web3 Association reflects a commitment to enhancing compliance standards in the crypto sector.
Moreover, the compliance efforts of crypto exchanges with Indian regulations have intensified, with platforms like Kraken, Gemini, and Gate.io initiating negotiations with regulators to address compliance issues. However, some exchanges, such as OKX and Bitstamp, have opted to exit the Indian market altogether in response to regulatory pressures.

Bitcoin (BTC) Price Is In a 'Bore to Death' Phase. When Will the BTC Rally Resume?

The current period resembles the action from April through September of 2023 when bitcoin was stuck in the $25,000-$30,000 range for an excruciating six months. Eventually, cryptocurrencies were able to sustain a multi-month rally, with BTC ultimately hitting an all-time high in March of this year.

"Base Season?" Coinbase L2 Earns Institutional Nod: Here's Why - DailyCoin


        
Coinbase-incubated Layer 2 Base has received recognition from Franklin Templeton.



The trillion-dollar asset manager has heralded the network’s strides in the SocialFi space.



The nod comes as the network records significant gains in several metrics outstripping market leaders Arbitrum and Optimism.
Base‘s notoriety is extending beyond degen circles.
In recent months, the Coinbase-incubated Ethereum Layer 2 has experienced a meteoric rise in several key metrics. This rise has now drawn the attention of $1.5 trillion asset manager Franklin Templeton. The firm has heralded the network’s potential, particularly in the SocialFi sector.A SocialFi HomerunIn a Thursday, May 9, report, Franklin Templeton asserted that Base “has hit a homerun” in SocialFi. The firm noted this while citing data that the Ethereum Layer 2 accounted for 46% of the SocialFi market share, outstripping close rivals Polygon and BNB.Base’s SocialFi landscape is dominated by Friend.Tech. The application, which allowed users to tokenize their social media accounts, was a hit sensation right out of the gate, gaining sign-ups from NBA stars and Y Combinator CEO Gary Tan. But, in recent months, the platform’s meteoric rise has taken a hit amid privacy, legal, security, and user experience concerns. Following a recent airdrop, however, the project appears to be experiencing a resurgence.Franklin Templeton tipped the combination of Base’s support of leading SocialFi applications and Coinbase’s partnership to see the network maintain a key position in the SocialFi and Ethereum Layer 2 space in general.
The recent Franklin Templeton nod comes as Base is beginning to outstrip other Layer 2 networks in several key metrics.Base Set to Sieze the Ethereum L2 Crown?On Thursday, May 9, crypto analytics platform IntoTheBlock shared data that showed that this week, Base had led the Ethereum Layer 2 ecosystem in several key metrics, including active addresses, daily transactions, and ETH inflows. According to the data, the network boasted 548,000 active addresses compared to Optimism‘s 534,000 and Arbitrum‘s 528,000. At the same time, the network also recorded 2.48 million transactions compared to the 1.97 million recorded by Arbitrum and the 550,000 recorded by Optimism. Base also saw the most ETH net inflows with 5.81K ETH, far more than the 2.73K ETH recorded by Arbitrum and the 1.46K ETH net inflows to Optimism.The recent strides come as the network has emerged as a favorite among investors following the Dencun upgrade.On the Flipside 
Coinbase maintains that Base will have no native token.



Base’s success has also attracted bad actors. According to a recent Scam Sniffer report, thefts on the network increased 145% month on month in April 2024.

JP Morgan, Wells Fargo latest major banks to disclose Bitcoin exposure via ETFs

JP Morgan and Wells Fargo are the latest major global banks to disclose exposure to Bitcoin via some of the spot BTC exchange-traded funds launched in January.The two lenders filed their 13F disclosures on May 10, revealing a modest investment in the Bitcoin ETFs.JP Morgan disclosed $731,246 of spot Bitcoin ETF investments in BlackRock’s IBIT,  Bitwise’s BITB,  Fidelity’s FBTC, and Grayscale’s GBTC. The majority of the amount — $477,425 — was invested in IBIT. Meanwhile, Wells Fargo reported a $141,817 investment in Grayscale’s GBTC during the first quarter.Earlier disclosures have revealed that both BNP Paribas and BNY Mellon have also invested amounts into the Bitcoin ETFs, signaling a growing trend among traditional financial institutions despite the modest exposures.Furthermore, other major banks, including Morgan Stanley and UBS, have indicated an intent to allow clients to invest in spot Bitcoin ETFs. However, the two lenders have yet to disclose direct exposure to Bitcoin as of press time.Industry experts, including BlackRock’s head of digital assets, believe that the trend of institutional flows into Bitcoin ETFs is only beginning with the volume expected to rise as more sophisticated money, like sovereign wealth funds, begin entering the sector.BlackRock 13FBlackRock disclosed a $6.6 million investment in its own IBIT fund in its 13F filing on May 10.The company’s strategy follows other spot Bitcoin ETF issuers that have similarly invested in their own funds. Ark Invest holds $206.4 million of its ARKB fund, while Van Eck holds $98,000 of its HODL fund.BlackRock’s latest investment comes alongside solid performance for BlackRock’s IBIT. The fund has the highest cumulative inflows of any spot Bitcoin ETF at $15,490 and is the second-largest spot Bitcoin ETF in terms of assets under management.BlackRock’s IBIT has also set a new record for reaching $10 billion in AUM. Bloomberg ETF analyst Eric Balchunas commented on the trend, noting:“The record speed for an ETF to reach $10b in assets was held by JEPQ who did it in 647 trading days … IBIT got there in 49 days, FBTC in 77 days.”TradFi entering BitcoinChicago-based hedge fund CTC Alternative Strategies reported a $27.7 million investment in IBIT on May 9.Other financial institutions and companies that recently disclosed investments in spot Bitcoin ETFs include Hightower Advisors, US Bancorp, SouthState, Susquehanna International Group, Burkett Financial Services, and Legacy Wealth Asset Management.The above companies are a few of the hundreds of other firms that have made similar disclosures in their 13F filings since spot Bitcoin ETFs went live in January.According to data from Fintel, over 240 firms have invested in IBIT, while over 130 companies have invested in FBTC. More than 467 firms have invested in Grayscale’s GBTC, which existed before its conversion to an ETF in January.Mentioned in this article

Jack Dorsey Predicts Bitcoin Boom to $1 Million by 2030: What's Driving His Bold Vision?


								Jack Dorsey, the former CEO of Twitter and a well-known figure in the tech and cryptocurrency sectors, recently shared his view that Bitcoin could reach $1 million by 2030.
His prediction is part of a broader bullish outlook on the pioneer cryptocurrency, suggesting that its value could continue to climb even after hitting this milestone.
Dorsey’s comments came during a detailed discussion about the future of digital currencies and his own experiences in the industry.

Dorsey’s Vision: Beyond Bitcoin’s Price
Dorsey’s enthusiasm for Bitcoin extends beyond its potential price appreciation. In the interview with Pirate Wires, he expressed a deep appreciation for the Bitcoin ecosystem, noting that it has been a significant source of learning for him.
According to Dorsey, the collaborative and open nature of the Bitcoin community means that efforts by any individual to improve the network or engage with it positively can lead to broader benefits for all participants. This aspect of Bitcoin, as much as its price potential seems to captivate him.
Dorsey particularly noted:
The most amazing thing about Bitcoin, apart from the founding story, is anyone who works on it, or gets paid in it, or buys it for themselves — everyone who puts any effort in to make it better — is making the entire ecosystem better, which makes the price go up.
In the same conversation where he discussed Bitcoin’s future, Dorsey also touched on his reasons for departing from BlueSky, the alternative social media platform he helped to co-found after leaving Twitter.
He criticized BlueSky for what he sees as its deviation from the original vision of decentralization, noting that the platform has started to mirror traditional corporate structures with its focus on venture capital and a formal board of directors.
This shift, according to Dorsey, contradicts the ethos of “decentralization and open-source protocols” that he aimed to champion. Dorsey’s critique extends to the broader tech industry’s approach to developing and managing digital platforms.
He believes that many of the mistakes made by Twitter are being repeated by BlueSky and others, particularly when it comes to governance and the balance between open protocols and corporate control.
His views highlight a tension within the tech world between the push for innovative, user-driven platforms and the pull of traditional business models.
Bitcoin Market Movements And Broader Predictions
While Dorsey has put forward a long-term view of BTC reaching $1 million, the crypto is currently trading above the $62,000 mark, showing a steady increase of 2.5% in the past 24 hours and 3.7% over the past week.
BTC price is moving sideways on the 4-hour chart. Source: BTC/USDT on TradingView.com
These movements are part of a wider trend that has seen various experts put forward optimistic forecasts for Bitcoin’s price trajectory.
For example, Tom Lee of Fundstrat has predicted that Bitcoin could rise to $150,000 by the end of the year, citing the launch of several spot Bitcoin ETFs as a key development that simplifies crypto investments for mainstream audiences.
Lee’s bullish stance is supported by his belief that the current crypto bull cycle is far from over, despite recent price dips and inflation concerns.

Further supporting this optimistic outlook, Standard Chartered’s research notes suggest that Bitcoin could reach $150,000, while Ethereum could hit $8,000 by the end of 2024. These projections reflect a growing consensus among financial analysts that major digital assets have substantial room to grow.

ARK Invest removes staking feature from its Ethereum spot ETF filing - Crypto Briefing




ARK Invest and 21Shares have amended their S-1 form for the proposed spot Ethereum exchange-traded fund (ETF) by removing the staking component, as shown by a filing dated May 10.In February, the two firms updated their filing with the option to stake Ethereum, in addition to cash-only redemption. Staking is considered a good way for fund managers to profit from the large amounts of crypto that ETFs can hold beyond just earning management fees.However, at the time, experts suggested that ARK Invest’s staking proposal for Ethereum was more of a “probe” to test the SEC’s response rather than a confident expectation that it would be approved by the securities agency.The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has indicated that staking could classify the asset as a security, which is undesirable for spot Ethereum ETFs. Last year, the SEC fined Kraken and demanded a halt to its staking services.Legendary trader Peter Brandt said in a recent post on X that the SEC is going to crack down on staking.The latest amendment to ARK Invest’s application fuels speculation about ongoing discussions between the SEC and spot Ethereum ETF applicants, suggesting that the applications are being modified to align with SEC preferences.The reasons for ARK Invest’s recent modification remain undisclosed, as no official statements have been made by the involved parties.Crypto analysts are marking May as a critical month for the future of these spot Ethereum ETFs. The SEC is expected to make a decision on VanEck’s filing on May 23. The general consensus among analysts is that the filing will likely be rejected.Earlier this week, Grayscale, the world’s leading digital asset manager, withdrew its Ethereum futures ETF application, potentially to avoid sole responsibility for legal challenges in case of a denial from the SEC.[Updated with ARK Invest’s filing in February, Kraken’s case, and Peter Brandt’s statement]

‘Sleeping Giant’ XRP About To Awaken - Why Ripple's XRP $5 Eruption Price Now Looks Nigh ⋆ ZyCrypto

&nbsp

&nbsp
Throughout 2024, Ripple’s XRP has lagged behind its top crypto rivals, registering around 4.5% year-to-date returns and failing to revisit its peak value set in January 2018. Contrarily, the wider cryptocurrency market has grown considerably, gaining circa 55% during the same timeframe.



The key reason behind XRP’s underperformance is the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission’s (SEC) pending case against Ripple. A court ruled last year that Ripple’s XRP sales to institutional customers constituted unlawful securities sales. The regulator has now requested a federal judge to impose a $2 billion penalty on the fintech startup.



However, according to Evai CEO Matthew Dixon, the tides could soon turn in favor of XRP. Dixon suggested that the forthcoming consumer price index (CPI) report for April, which is set to be released on May 15, could awaken the “sleeping giant” and drive the XRP price to new heights. He anticipates a weeker-than-expected CPI index to light a fire under the XRP bulls.



Economists estimate that the CPI rose 0.3% month-on-month in April ahead of the Wednesday report, which would cast doubt on hopes for a Federal Reserve rate cut this summer. Nevertheless, lower-than-expected numbers would benefit risk assets such as major altcoins like XRP.



XRP Set For Rapid Rally To New Highs?



Despite facing extreme sell-pressure over the last five years, XRP remains in a consolidation phase, with the XRPArmy attentively looking out for a huge breakout that could propel its price past the magical $5 milestone, setting a new record high.

Ripple and the SEC are currently in the lawsuit’s remedies stage. Ripple’s chief legal officer Stuart Alderoty recently indicated that the nearly 4-year long legal battle is almost coming to an end, as ZyCrypto reported.



As the crypto community eagerly awaits the outcome of the long-drawn-out suit, experts expect a final judgment around September. Meanwhile, Ripple is primed to launch XRPL enterprise solutions to the Japanese market via a strategic partnership with Tokyo-based consulting company HashKey DX.

Only a fool would vote on crypto alone - Blockworks


US presidential candidates on both sides of the two-party spectrum are taking advantage of the crypto industry.
You’ll notice how I didn’t say that crypto will be a hot button topic this election season, or that the crypto space will play any sort of role in shaping election discourse. 
No. It’s clear to me that some of the main players in this presidential race are planning to exploit the crypto world for money and votes — and those in crypto should stop playing along.
Why should favorable cryptocurrency legislation take precedence over all else? Perhaps you really believe that the financial system is broken, and that a path forward for cryptocurrency in the US is the best way to create a new, more egalitarian society that will allow all to flourish. 
But that’s not what I see. 
What I see is a small number of wealthy individuals, who made that wealth from cryptocurrency, looking for the government to let them continue growing that wealth unfettered.
Among diehard crypto evangelists right now, “voting for crypto” means voting Republican for president. According to this side of the debate, any other decision will virtually assure the death of the American crypto industry. 
This fear (true or not) has led some major personalities in Web3 to push crypto supporters into becoming single-issue voters. Their message is clear: Choose your 2024 candidates based solely on their cryptocurrency stance, or else.
In other words, Americans should prioritize their own selfish financial interests over broader societal and ethical concerns. When you promote the idea of voting for America’s crypto industry above all else, you’re deciding to ignore all of the other issues that are really at stake this election season — healthcare access, Social Security, gun legislation, women’s rights, LGBT issues, immigration, to name a few.  
I want to be clear — I do not care if you vote Republican, Democrat, or third-party, as long as you care about the issues at stake, and truly believe that the candidate in question is representative of your views. But voting for a candidate you would not otherwise support, simply because they favor the deregulation of a sector in which you hold a profit motive, is a compromise that you should not make.
Crypto isn’t political by accident
Cryptocurrency has undeniably (and perhaps unfortunately) become a partisan issue.
Blockchain technology, which underpins the entire crypto industry, is neither inherently good or bad. But it’s the actions of individuals and what they do with this technology that has drawn regulatory scrutiny over the years. This has transformed a neutral technology stack into a deeply partisan issue, with sharply divided views across party lines concerning its integration into the American financial system and beyond.
On the left side of the political spectrum — the same side already in favor of stricter financial regulations — politicians often place crypto against a global backdrop of scams, money laundering and market manipulation to strengthen their calls for oversight. Their tagline is to keep consumers safe.
Lawmakers on the right — who already favor less financial regulation as a rule — instead posit that intense crypto regulation will cripple innovation and impede technological advancement. They say that their aim is to keep American innovation moving forward at a brisk pace, far ahead of other countries like China. 
However, their supposed motivations are arguably applicable only during the election season. Because what all politicians actually want is your attention, your money, and ultimately your ballot. As with most issues, when the time comes, it is unlikely that much in the way of meaningful change will come from either side of the aisle. Instead, it will be the actions of the innovators within the crypto space that move the needle forward — which you would think that anyone who truly supports a limited government would appreciate.
The very idea that crypto needs to be “voted” into office has led to the platforming of some very unsavory people who really have nothing to do with crypto at all — besides a shared desire to solicit donations from this niche, newly rich subset of Americans.
Last year, Vivek Ramaswamy gave a fireside chat at Messari’s Mainnet last fall, promoting his presidential crypto plan a few months before he dropped out of the race. Consensus will have Robert F. Kennedy Jr. speak this year, announcing the news with a headline calling him a “pro-crypto presidential candidate.” I can think of a lot of other modifiers for RFK Jr. that are more headline-worthy than his stance on crypto. 
And most importantly, Crypto Twitter has, for the most part, widely embraced former President Donald Trump’s words of support for NFTs and crypto. And far be it for me to say whether that support is genuine, or more largely based on the fact that he’s made millions of dollars selling NFTs branded with his own image.
Backing these candidates simply because they seem to make positive noise about crypto isn’t taking back the power from Wall Street or helping make the world a more financially equitable place — it’s falling for empty campaign rhetoric. 
The idea that any presidential (or gubernatorial or senatorial) candidate is trying to win favor with the crypto crowd because they truly believe in crypto is laughable. These candidates are looking for crypto money, nothing more and nothing less. Those in crypto who support such candidates are either willing to pretend that these officials understand even the basic strokes of how crypto works under the hood (let alone its implications for the broader frameworks of finance and democracy), or they are willing to compromise their morals and ethics for the mere possibility of moon-making crypto legislation in the future.
As the one, big, obvious example: If you believe that Donald Trump will truly support the crypto industry, you have to be willing to overlook his judicially acknowledged sexual assault charges, overt institutional fraud and genuine attempts to overthrow American democracy when you cast your vote in November. 
Is cryptocurrency really that important to you?

Will Vitalik Buterin’s Gas Fee Proposal Make Ethereum More Like Solana? - Decrypt

Ethereum could use a much better system for charging transaction fees from its users, the network's chief architect Vitalik Buterin argued in a widely circulated essay published Thursday.Buterin's post, which laid out a path toward a more customized and equitable system, immediately garnered reactions from two principal groups: Ethereum users, who expressed their excitement at the prospect of lower fees on the network’s costly mainnet; and Solana users and developers, who noticed that Buterin's proposal sounded an awful lot like the Solana network's own fee model.“It’s certainly a Solana-esque approach,” Mert Mumtaz, a prominent Solana builder and the co-founder and CEO of infrastructure startup Helius Labs, told Decrypt.So just how similar is Buterin’s “multidimensional gas fees” proposal to Solana's "local fee markets"?Gas fees refer to the transaction costs that blockchain users pay to the network. This system is in many ways what gives tokens like Ethereum (ETH) and Solana (SOL) their value. You need ETH to pay gas if you want to do just about anything on the Ethereum network, just like you need SOL to do things on Solana. When there's a lot of activity on the network, gas fees go up. And when there's less activity, gas fees go down.In some ways, Solana's current gas fee structure and Vitalik's “multidimensional gas fees” proposal stem from the same philosophy: In the name of fairness, different types of on-chain transactions should cost different amounts, depending on demand. But in practice, leaders of both networks appear to have different ideas about how to implement such a philosophy—leading to a potentially significant difference in user experience.Solana currently operates on a “local fee markets” structure, wherein gas fees are calculated on a per-account basis, project by project. In this system, spikes in gas fees due to network congestion are effectively quarantined to specific projects.For example, a spike in gas fees induced by a hot Solana NFT mint should only impact users who are interacting with that project—users elsewhere across the entire Solana network should be unaffected. (There is currently some disagreement within the Solana community about whether local fee markets actually work as effectively as intended, in part due to the hyper-congestion that can occur in crowded mini-gas ecosystems.)But Solana’s setup makes a clear contrast to Ethereum—where demand for wildly popular NFTs has previously clogged the entire network, sending gas fees skyrocketing for everyone. The “multidimensional gas fees” concept proposed by Vitalik Buterin does seek to make Ethereum transaction costs more equitable. But it doesn't appear to outline a boutique system like Solana’s, in which every individual project on Ethereum would become its own siloed gas ecosystem. Instead, multidimensional gas on Ethereum would only distinguish between different macro categories of effort required to complete network transactions, Ethereum core developer Marius Van Der Wijden told Decrypt. For example, computation, storage, and calldata might fetch different premiums at a given moment, depending on demand. Different on-chain transactions consist of different ratios of those categories of computing. Per Buterin, Ethereum’s Dencun upgrade, which went live in March, constituted the debut of such a system by sending layer-2 data, the sort that comes from layer-2 networks like Arbitrum, to “blobs.” Blobs feature different prices and different limits than the rest of an Ethereum block. At a macro level, expanding multidimensional gas to differentiate between more computational categories might improve Ethereum’s efficiency, and in Buterin's view, significantly increase scalability of the network’s mainnet. But it likely wouldn't insulate Ethereum users from spikes in network volatility induced by trending projects—it’s not that boutique in design.So, all that is to say: Solana and Ethereum maximalists, fear not. There will still be plenty of differences to pick apart.Edited by Andrew HaywardStay on top of crypto news, get daily updates in your inbox.

                        Wells Fargo, the third largest bank in the United States, has invested in one of the country’s new Bitcoin ETF products.According to a 13F-HR form submitted on Friday, the bank held exposure worth $143 million across three different Bitcoin investment products as of March 31.Wells Fargo Buys Bitcoin
The vast majority of those funds were held with the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) – a Bitcoin spot ETF whose shares are designed to track Bitcoin’s spot price during traditional stock market hours. The fund directly backs its shares with a fixed amount of BTC, which gradually declines over time due to management fees.The other two Bitcoin-related investments include a $99,000 position in the Bitcoin ATM provider Bitcoin Depot and a $1.2 million position in the ProShares Bitcoin Strategy ETF (BITO), a Bitcoin futures ETF.The total position represents just a drop of Wells Fargo’s $603 billion in assets under management and has likely shrunk alongside Bitcoin’s price since the reporting period.Nevertheless, the crypto community has hailed the bank’s allocation as a massive step toward institutional Bitcoin adoption.Back in 2018, the same bank temporarily banned crypto credit card purchases, but its analysts came to recognize Bitcoin’s rapid adoption growth and price appreciation over the coming years.Why Choose Grayscale?
Wells Fargo began offering Bitcoin ETFs as an investment option in February for clients who specifically requested the product. Since launching in January, U.S. Bitcoin spot ETFs have absorbed $11.8 billion of net inflows.Other major financial institutions have also disclosed substantial allocations to Bitcoin ETFs in previous weeks. So far, the largest known owner of the products is Susquehanna International Group, an investment firm with $438 billion AUM holding $1.8 billion in Bitcoin ETFs.Interestingly, both Wells Fargo and Susquehanna invested most heavily into GBTC, which is the most expensive of all its competitors. The fund charges 1.5% per year in management fees, compared to a 0.3% management cost from most other rivals like BlackRock and Fidelity.Grayscale is currently the largest Bitcoin ETF thanks to its pre-ETF launch Bitcoin stack, but only by a thin margin. The fund has suffered nearly endless outflows since January 11.

MetalCoreâs CTO on how to make a Web3 game fun: âWe use what we understandâ - Crypto Briefing




Blockchain games dominated the first quarter, representing 30% of all on-chain activity in this period, according to the “State of the Dapp Industry Q1 2024” report by DappRadar. The report highlights that an average of 2.1 million wallets were active daily during Q1.This dominance in gaming activity on the blockchain could mean that analysts’ expectations about Web3 games focusing on entertainment this cycle are being fulfilled. MetalCore is a blockchain shooting game from this new batch of titles focused on entertaining gameplay, and it is finding success in its second closed beta testing.“[The number of players] It’s actually a lot more than we expected. We planned for a couple hundred, maybe 1,000 players. We’ve got close to 9,000 players and about 1,500 to 2,000 daily active users. And then at any given time, we have somewhere between 300 and 400 concurrent users, which is really good for a game that is not freely available, you still have to sign up on a waitlist and get keys,” shared Dan Nikolaides, CTO of MetalCore.The second closed beta test for MetalCore ends May 16th, after a two-week period used majorly to test game economy and check bugs, added Nikolaides. Since those testing periods are executed without the completed game, they are harder to retain players, which is why MetalCore’s team is surprised by the number of players dedicating up to 50 hours a week to the game.However, making a blockchain game fun is not an easy task, especially because most of the teams behind new Web3 titles are from the traditional gaming industry, and must get acclimated to new standards.“Web3 industry is really young still, so it’s hard to know what’s right. And that leads to changing directions, more so than we would do in Web2. Changing directions from a business perspective is not something that you typically would need to do in Web2. It is pretty much about thinking: well, this is going to be a premium game or a free-to-play game, or we’re going to sell it in bundles, or whatever it is going to do. Whatever the business plan is, that doesn’t require you to change your entire development process.”Yet, in Web3 there are more factors to consider, such as choosing a blockchain to deploy digital assets and deciding whether or not the game will have tokens. This drastically affects the technology stack used and what the team can do with digital assets, said MetalCore’s CTO.“Are we going to be able to upgrade them? Are they gonna have attributes that we can cheaply upgrade and can players level them up? Or is that gonna be too cost-prohibitive? That is just the simplest of things. Even from the business side, we have to question when we should launch from a market perspective. Like when is a good time to launch a token? Who should we partner with? All of these are very, very difficult decisions that we have to make besides just making the game, which definitely there was a learning curve there for us to figure all this out.”Scratching an ideaMetalCore is a multiplayer shooting game that reminds famous titles, such as Titanfall and Destiny. Players can go on missions, use different battle vehicles, and fight alien monsters. Nikolaides shared that the decision to create a multiplayer online game is tied to the “company DNA,” but it started outside the Web3.“We started this off actually as a VR game. So we made a VR game called World of Mechs for Quest 2 [VR goggles]. And that was really fun. Our founder has a long history of developing mech games. And once we did that, we had a really good foundation for fun mech combat. And we were like: ‘What if we took this and made a big PC game out of it?’ And at the time, we weren’t sure how to fund it. We weren’t sure how to make it happen.”Migrating to Web3 then made sense, as the team would be able to create a new blockchain title from scratch, instead of just trying to “slam a game into Web3.” After this decision, Nikolaides explains that making the game free-to-play was the next logical step, as the team didn’t want to gatekeep the game with costly NFTs, allowing players to build a community around it.“Gatekeeping games with NFTs is just not fun. The fun thing about games like this is when you can show off. If you have something really cool, naturally you want to show off to other people. But if you make a game where you have to buy a super expensive NFT just to play, there’s nobody to show off to. Nobody else is there to be like ‘oh my god, that’s so cool.’ So people generally, just the average person, really loves to feel they have achieved something.”Keep it simpleBesides the initial barrier of getting used to a new industry, Nikolaides shares additional challenges when creating a fun Web3 game, and how MetalCore’s team overcame them. “There are all the normal challenges that come with making a fun game even in Web 2, which is difficult by itself. Then there are additional challenges, which are the kind of economic challenges of designing a system that works in Web3.”MetalCore’s approach then was to keep “as close as possible to something they understood,” says Nikolaides. They already understood the idea of building a character, leveling it up, improving its load-outs, spending time, energy, resources, and money potentially upgrading it and making it “super bad-ass,” he adds.“And then we thought that with a free marketplace of NFTs, people would want to sell upgraded characters. And so we kind of designed our game around upgrading characters, right? This was very important for us, because instead of trying to do something very complicated, we kind of could take a lot of lessons that we learned in Web2, that we understood from designing game economies that involved upgrading characters, and then just kind of do it in such a way that it was Web3 friendly.”

WBTC address poisoner sends nearly all funds back to victim after negotiations

The address poisoning attacker who tricked a user into sending them 1,155 Wrapped Bitcoin (wBTC) (worth $68 million at the time) has returned nearly all of the funds stolen, blockchain data shows. The funds had been swapped for Ether (ETH) during the time period that they were held by the attacker, and the price of ETH had fallen. However, the attacker sent back approximately 22,960.07 ETH, worth $65.7 million, which represents over 96% of the US dollar value of the funds t originally stolen.Address poisoning victim’s wallet shows over 22,000 ETH held within it. Source: Etherscan.At 8:47 am UTC on May 10, multiple wallets began sending ETH to the account. The first transfer was for 29.999 ETH ($87,199 based on the ETH price at the time). Over the course of the next day, over 225 wallet transactions were made from various accounts to send ETH to the victim’s address. The value of each transaction ranged from 29 to 67 ETH.Accounts sending ETH to the victim’s address. Source: Etherscan.By the end of the series of transactions, the wallet had a balance of over 29,000 ETH. The transfers occurred after a series of messages had been exchanged between the victim and attacker. The victim had at first agreed to allow the attacker to keep 10% of the funds as a bounty. However, this deal appears to no longer be on the table, as the attacker has returned more than 90% at the time of publication.In a report attributed to blockchain security platform Match Systems and seen by Cointelegraph, the platform claimed to have discovered information that “strengthened” the victim’s negotiating position, implying that security experts were making progress towards identifying who the attacker was. According to the report, Match Systems “conducted a detailed analysis of the incident and identified several opportunities to strengthen the negotiating position for subsequent communication with the attacker.” As a result, “the hacker returned the entire stolen amount of 22,960 ETH to the victim.” The report stated that the victim “has no complaints against the attacker” at the moment.Cointelegraph reached out to Match Systems to confirm the report’s authenticity, but did not receive a response by the time of publication.Address poisoning attacks can cause substantial losses to crypto users. Experts suggest that they can be avoided by carefully inspecting the receiving address before each transaction is sent.Related: DEA gets duped: Agency loses $55K in address poisoning scam

&nbsp

&nbsp
A new player has entered the meme coin arena, making waves with a crazy purchase of over 350 billion PEPE tokens on the Binance exchange. This acquisition, worth an estimated $2.914 million, has ignited speculation and excitement in the crypto space, raising questions about PEPE’s future trajectory.



The transaction, reported by the analytics account @lookonchain on X, marks the emergence of a potential mega whale in the PEPE ecosystem. With such a substantial investment, this new player has positioned itself as a powerful force in the meme coin market. This event has also sparked speculation about their motivations and the potential impact on PEPE’s price movement.



Major Moves



Furthermore, PEPE’s ecosystem is becoming increasingly active. That’s because a significant volume of tokens is exchanged between anonymous wallets, and substantial transfers are made to wallets associated with major exchanges like Kraken. These movements suggest active trading and strategic positioning by investors.



Despite a minor decline following the initial surge, PEPE’s price remains relatively stable, currently trading at $0.000008326 per token at the time of writing. However, the entry of a new whale investor and the surge in trading activity raises the question: can this significant acquisition send the meme coin even higher?



What’s Next for PEPE?



The answer remains uncertain, as the crypto market is highly volatile and unpredictable. That’s especially true when talking about meme coins. While the influx of a large investor could potentially increase confidence and drive further price appreciation, it also introduces new dynamics and uncertainties into the market. Crypto enthusiasts will follow the situation closely in the coming days to see the impact of this acquisition on PEPE’s price dynamics.

&nbsp



In conclusion, a new crypto wallet on Binance purchased over 350 billion PEPE tokens, sparking excitement and speculation within the memecoin community. As the market awaits further developments, all eyes will be on PEPE to see if this significant transaction can propel the meme coin to new heights.

Here's Why Vitalik Buterin Endorsed Privacy Protocol Railgun


In a recent interview with BeInCrypto, Alan Scott, a researcher at Railgun, elaborated on the recent endorsement by Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin. 
This endorsement highlights the advancements and the unique privacy features that Railgun aims to bring to the decentralized finance (DeFi) sector.
DeFi Through Zero Knowledge Proof Tech
Railgun leverages zero-knowledge proofs (zk-SNARKs) to ensure user privacy while interacting with DeFi applications. 

“Zero-knowledge proofs allow users to prove a statement’s truth without revealing the actual information. In Railgun’s case, users can prove they own a specific balance of encrypted tokens in the Railgun smart contract, enabling privacy-preserving transactions,” Scott told BeInCrypto. 


The project stands out in the DeFi space with its ability to perform cross-contract calls privately. This innovation allows users to engage in various DeFi activities, such as swapping and farming, from a privacy-preserving externally owned account (EOA). “This feature is a huge advantage,” Scott noted, and “it’s encouraging to see recognition from one of the greatest minds in the space.”
Vitalik Buterin’s endorsement has invigorated the Railgun team, sparking new initiatives and driving execution. While new collaborations have not yet materialized, the endorsement boosts the project’s credibility and motivates contributors to enhance DeFi privacy solutions.

Railgun’s features include Private Proofs of Innocence, which help users demonstrate non-interaction with malicious actors on-chain. This technology ensures that users are not sharing a system with nefarious addresses. Additionally, Railgun integrates auditability features, such as a view-only private key, enabling users to reveal transaction graphs to third parties and integrate with tax software like Koinly.
Scott emphasized the importance of both technology and education in addressing privacy challenges. This approach pushed Railgun into developing comprehensive documentation and active community presence on platforms like Telegram and Discord.


“The best approach to these kinds of challenges is tech and education based. It’s about demonstrating from a technical standpoint not only how these tools work but also their practical effects,” Scott said. 

Privacy on the Blockchain Should Be Easy
Looking ahead, Railgun is set to introduce two major updates. The first is Version 3, which is a complete rework of the contracts to a modular architecture. It enables new private DeFi capabilities such as leverage and reducing gas costs by up to 50% for certain transactions. 
The second one is Railgun Connect, a universal privacy plugin for Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM). It allows users to use their private balance on most DeFi platforms without requiring integration. 

With these, the protocol aims to make private transactions as straightforward as public ones. Therefore, it ensures that DeFi users do not have to sacrifice privacy for self-custody and on-chain opportunities.

“The goal is to make private transactions as easy to use as public transactions such that all DeFi users can remain private with as much of the complexity abstracted away as possible. DeFi users shouldn’t be forced to choose between embracing self-custody and on-chain opportunities or giving up their valuable financial data,” Scott explained.

Collaboration within the privacy ecosystem is also a priority. Scott highlighted efforts by Ameen Solamani and initiatives like Web3Privacy.info, which compile research on privacy mechanisms. These collaborations aim to advance the understanding and implementation of privacy technologies in the DeFi space.

This commitment to innovation and privacy reflects why Vitalik Buterin’s endorsement is well-deserved, spotlighting Railgun’s potential to transform the DeFi sector.

JUST IN: A Glimmer of Hope for Ethereum Spot ETFs? SEC Gets the Change It Wanted - Bitcoin Sistemi


According to the hot development, Ark Invest has updated its application again by removing the staking part from the Ethereum Spot ETF application.
It was known that the SEC did not want the staking feature for spot ETFs, as it made the asset a security. Now the removal of this feature from the application has led to speculation that there are negotiations between Ethereum Spot ETF applicants and the SEC and that the applications are shaped according to the SEC's wishes.




However, the reason for this latest change is not known for certain and no statement has been released from the parties yet.






Cryptocurrency analysts point to May as a very important month for these ETFs. May 23 is particularly highlighted as an important date for VanEck's spot Ethereum ETF application deadline. So far, analysts are leaning towards the possibility that these ETFs will likely be rejected.
Grayscale, the world's largest digital asset provider, recently withdrew its own Ethereum futures ETF, thus avoiding shouldering the burden of litigation alone in the event of a rejection from the SEC.

EigenLayer Exclusive $15 Billion Token Launch: Who's In And Who's Out?


																The crypto world is currently abuzz with the launch of EigenLayer’s new token, EIGEN, which has quickly become one of the year’s most anticipated digital asset events.
According to Bloomberg, the project has attracted significant attention for its approach to decentralized finance (DeFi) and its “controversial” decision to exclude users from certain jurisdictions, including the US, China, and Canada, from participating in the token distribution.

EigenLayer Challenges And Opportunities in Token Distribution
EigenLayer, a DeFi protocol based in Seattle, has made waves in the industry by introducing a concept known as restaking. This method aims to increase rewards on the Ethereum blockchain by allowing users to deposit ETH to help operate the network.
According to data from DeFiLlama, since its debut in 2023, EigenLayer has attracted over $15 billion in assets, demonstrating the significant interest and potential of this new approach.

The launch of the EIGEN token is set to commence with an airdrop, a process where tokens are distributed to users based on certain criteria, including a points system that rewards early service adopters.
Kunal Goel, an analyst at Messari, noted that anticipating this airdrop was a “primary incentive” for users to place funds in EigenLayer’s service.
However, the excitement has been tempered by the fact that many participants who accumulated points are now barred from claiming their tokens due to using virtual private networks or residing in excluded countries.
Robert Drost, executive director at the Eigen Foundation, explained that the exclusions were a necessary step to adhere to regulatory guidelines, which are often unclear and challenging to navigate, noting:
It’s not possible to operate in the space without following regulatory guidelines and being responsible, and the challenging part is that there is not a lot of clarity.
This sentiment was echoed by Nick Cote, co-founder of Secondlane, who noted:
Issuers not being upfront with jurisdictional restrictions leaves a sour taste in people’s mouth when it comes time to receiving your rewards, and then you find out you’re disqualified for X, Y, Z reason.
Impact On The Broader DeFi Ecosystem
EigenLayer’s restaking service is not just a new feature in the Ethereum ecosystem; it represents a shift in how applications can leverage the deep pool of transaction validators that underpin Ethereum.
This service increases the yield from staking ETH – from a baseline of around 3% to higher rates, albeit with additional risks.

As a result, EigenLayer has risen to become the “second most popular DeFi application,” as reported by Bloomberg, partly at the expense of liquid staking protocols like Lido and Rocket Pool, which have seen significant outflows in recent months.

Ethereum's latest 'low' - How ETH's price action is affecting staking - AMBCrypto



The number of new ETH staked daily has dropped on the charts
This can be attributed to the altcoin’s meek price performance

The daily amount of new Ethereum [ETH] staked fell to a year-to-date (YTD) low on 6 May, according to Glassnode’s data. 
Information from the on-chain data provider revealed that the number of coins transferred to the staking deposit contract address on that day totalled 11,285 ETH (valued at approximately $34 million). This figure marked a 92% decline from the YTD peak of 192,008 ETH coins staked on 28 March.
Source: Glassnode
Assessed using a 30-day moving average, the amount of new ETH staked initiated its downtrend on 29 February, with the same since down by over 85%.
Fall in ETH’s price to be blamed?
The crash in the daily amount of new ETH staked can be attributed to the altcoin’s price action. In fact, according to CoinMarketCap’s data, ETH was valued at $3,033 at press time, having shed 14% of its value in just 30 days. 
When ETH holders “lock” up their coins, their rewards are typically paid out in ETH upon maturity or expiration of the staking period. Therefore, if ETH’s value declines, the dollar value of those rewards to which they are entitled also falls. 
For example, on the leading liquid staking platform Lido Finance [LDO], its staking Annual Percentage Rate (APR) has trended south since 19 April. With a reading of 2.9% at the time of writing, this has dropped by 19% since the aforementioned date, according to data from Dune Analytics.
Source: Dune Analytics
This can make staking a less attractive venture to new investors seeking returns.
Also, the coin’s short-term holders, known to be the major drivers of day-to-day price action, are often paper-handed. This means they are willing to sell at any sight of “trouble.” As such, they may be discouraged from staking their holdings if ETH’s price continues to drop, and they may opt to sell their coins instead.

Read Ethereum’s [ETH] Price Prediction 2024-25

Network validators are unmoved by low price action
Despite ETH’s current performance, voluntary exits by its network validators have continued to fall. According to Glassnode’s data, after rallying to a YTD peak of 2000 on 2 April, the daily count of validators that have left the network has dropped by 61%. 
Due to this, the number of active validators on the network has continued to surge. At press time, there were 994,000 active validators on the Ethereum network.

XRP Price Prediction: Crypto Pundit Predicts 46,900% Breakout To $246, Here’s How | Bitcoinist.com


								A crypto analyst has predicted a mega-bullish rally for the XRP price, the native token of the XRP Ledger (XRPL). Using trend lines, a technical analysis tool used to identify the direction in which a cryptocurrency’s price is moving, the analyst has projected a breakout to $250. 
Analyst Predicts XRP Is About To Go Parabolic
A crypto analyst identified as “The Block Bull,” on X (formerly Twitter) has shared a blueprint of XRP’s price action during this market cycle. The analyst has identified crucial junctures for XRP, including anticipated break-out points, interim peaks and the transition into a bear market as the market cycle completes. 

He has projected that XRP could rise to $250 during this bull cycle, potentially experiencing a 46,900% surge by year-end, with the momentum extending into 2025.
Sharing a chart depicting XRP’s price movements from 2015 to 2024, the crypto analyst noted several super cycles XRP had experienced. He revealed that XRP had witnessed a breakout in 2018, occurring 36 weeks after the Bitcoin halving and concluding after 77 weeks.
During the second Bitcoin halving in 2021, the crypto analyst revealed that XRP also underwent another breakout within 36 weeks, reaching an interim peak 48 weeks after Bitcoin halving. Based on this time analysis of the XRP price, The crypto pundit projects a parabolic surge in XRP’s price in the present market cycle, potentially leading to a breakout 36 weeks after the Bitcoin halving event on April 20, 2024.  
The Block Bull foresees the possibility of XRP experiencing a breakout akin to previous cycles, with a potential interim peak 48 weeks after the Bitcoin halving, specifically on March 24, 2025. Additionally, he suggests that XRP could transition into a bear market phase by October 2025, likely within the first or second week of the month. 
XRP Price Update
Currently, 20 days after the 2024 Bitcoin halving event, XRP’s price is trading at $0.51, marking a monthly price decrease of 15.90%, according to CoinMarketCap. The cryptocurrency has failed to witness a significant rally, despite the market’s overperformance at the beginning of the year. 
While The Block Bull has maintained an optimistic outlook for XRP’s price trajectory in the 2024 bull cycle, several community members hold divergent views. A crypto member who criticized the analyst’s ambitious price target, argues that a more conservative rise to $1 for XRP seems more plausible than a dramatic surge to $250 by the end of the year.

Others have outrightly dismissed the $250 price prediction, highlighting the prevailing pessimism within the broader crypto community concerning the XRP’s price fundamentals. Since the legal clash between Ripple and the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), the XRP price has declined significantly, struggling to regain its past momentum.
The cryptocurrency has also been consolidating around the $0.5 price point for months, disappointing most XRP investors and holders who hope for a potential price surge to new all-time highs.

‘Open-source’ CBDCs aren’t going to protect you from government

People are taking notice more each day that central bank digital currencies, or CBDCs, are not worth the risk. Yet, to combat these concerns, some policymakers have been increasingly looking toward open-source coding as a way to offer transparency and perhaps win the public’s trust. But make no mistake, while transparency is welcome, it’s no silver bullet.For those familiar with cryptocurrency, the concept of using open-source code needs no introduction. However, for those that might not be familiar, the concept simply refers to publicly publishing the source code behind a project instead of locking it away as confidential or a trade secret. For example, the code behind Bitcoin (BTC) is free and open for all to see. Making a project open source has many advantages. For instance, doing so opens the doors for external audits. After a careful review, someone may find a vulnerability that wasn’t apparent to the original designers. Or, perhaps more concerningly, someone may find something nefarious embedded deep within the project. Related: 3 trends to think about before Bitcoin's bull run resumesTurning back to the example of Bitcoin, having the code be freely available allows people to verify that the 21 million supply cap is more than just an advertising slogan — it’s embedded within the design. In effect, publishing the code behind a project helps people know who they can (or can’t) trust. Yet, open-source coding is no silver bullet — especially when it comes to the problems that plague CBDCs. Consider what happened in Brazil last year. Brazil’s central bank published the source code for its pilot CBDC and it took just four days for people to notice that the CBDC had tools for surveillance and control embedded within its code. Were this the case with a decentralized cryptocurrency, people could carve out a new path and fork the chain, or simply not use it. But what recourse is there for CBDC users when a CBDC is the epitome of centralized money under government control? People could speak out, but central banks are often steered by unelected officials who do not answer to the public. People could choose an alternative money, but governments often try to stomp out currency competition. So while the transparency is helpful for understanding how the system works, it does little by itself to help citizens who want to change the system.Shifting the focus slightly, the U.S. code offers an illustrative example. Anyone can crack open the U.S. code, look to title 12, chapter 35, section 3413 and section 3414 to see there are 20 different exceptions that allow the government to effectively ignore your right to financial privacy. This transparency is certainly helpful for understanding how the government maintains such an expansive financial surveillance system, but transparency alone is not enough to fix the problem. Another example of why open-source code is not a silver bullet for fixing CBDCs can be seen in Norway where the Norwegian central bank also published the code behind its CBDC project. Yet here the problem is slightly different — it demonstrates that what is open source today may not be open source tomorrow. When dealing with a centralized entity like a national government, that decision can come quickly and without consulting the public. Norway’s central bank acknowledged this point quite explicitly by noting that its current focus in no way represents a long-standing commitment to open-source code.As a final example, the experience in the United States also demonstrates that previous statements do not represent a future commitment to open-source technology. The Federal Reserve has conducted CBDC research and pilots for years. However, one notable project was the collaboration with MIT. Referred to as “Project Hamilton,” this project led to the creation of an open-source CBDC model. Yet, nothing binds the Federal Reserve to the results of Project Hamilton or any open-source model. In fact, the Federal Reserve seems to have all but abandoned the project. Related: Jerome Powell’s pivot heralds a boring summer for BitcoinWe are still seeing the very early stages of CBDC development, but these examples are telling. Policymakers should be commended for embracing transparency, but the public shouldn’t be fooled into thinking that transparency is a panacea that fixes all of the problems posed by a CBDC. Although the use of open-source technology has been one of the cornerstones of cryptocurrency development, people should not lose sight that decentralized cryptocurrency also gives people the power to act on that information. And it is that condition that has created a revolution in the way people think about money and finance. There is no way a CBDC can replicate that benefit. The problems here extend far beyond the often-obfuscated conduct of central banks and go right to the core question of how much power a government should have . Fundamentally, the problem with CBDCs is that they risk centralizing money more than ever before, so much so that it risks giving the government virtually unlimited power over citizens’ economic choices.

Cardano ($ADA) Price Could Surge Over 1,500% in Near Future, Analyst Says | Cryptoglobe


                                
A popular cryptocurrency analyst known as Javon Marks on the microblogging platform X (formerly known as Twitter), has recently suggested that the price of the native token of smart contract platform Cardano ($ADA) could surge over 1.500% in the near future.



In a post shared with their nearly 40.000 followers, the analyst noted that the price of Ada has showed “major progress since breaking the resisting trend” surging more than 200$ toward “its first target at $2.7709,” with a recent pullback potentially “streghtening them for even more climbing.”



The analyst added that if the breakout holds ADA could see a potential further upside of over 460% to reach its target. Adding that based on historical data it could go much higher, pointing to the $7.8 mark as a possibility. That mark would represent a rise of over 1.500% for the cryptocurrency.







Another cryptocurrency analyst, known as Trend Rider on the microblogging platform, said that the price of ADA is holding onto its support level and if it manages to do so over the next one to two weeks, bears will get tired and the cryptocurrency’s price could bounce.







            
            

            
            

            
            

        

Cardano’s native token Ada is at the time of writing trading at $0.45 after losing over 2% of its value over the last 24-hour period and more than 23% over the last 30 days amid a wider cryptocurrency market correction.



Nevertheless the Cardano community has kept on building, with the number of its Plutus V2 smart contract growing by over 1,000 in a single month even as the cryptocurrency market corrected.



The number of smart contracts on Cardano surpassed 1,000 back in January 2022 after the price of ADA exploded with the rollout of the widely anticipated Alonzo hard fork, which brought smart contracts into the network, allowing it to compete with other blockchains such as the BNB Chain ($BNB), Ethereum ($ETH), and Solana ($SOL).

Shiba Doge Hybrid (SHIDOGE) Will Surge 8,000% as MEXC Listing Announced, as Shiba Inu and Dogecoin Struggle



                    

Shiba Doge Hybrid (SHIDOGE) could turn early investors into multi-millionaires if it becomes a mainstream coin, like Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE).



Shiba Doge Hybrid (SHIDOGE), a new Solana memecoin that was launched this week, is poised to explode over 8,000% in price in the coming days.




This is because SHIDOGE has announced its first centralized exchange listing, which will be on MEXC.



This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up.



Currently, Shiba Doge Hybrid (SHIDOGE) can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jupiter and Raydium, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days.




Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Shiba Doge Hybrid (SHIDOGE) could become the next viral memecoin.



To buy Shiba Doge Hybrid on Raydium or Jupiter ahead of the MEXC listing, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for SHIDOGE by entering its contract address – 797CmcxqkLZaSjMd7MdyNZ9swuSzaGdYWkJ65jehiXWa – in the receiving field.



In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price.



If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner.




The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum.



This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like SHIDOGE.

Will OpenAI Let ChatGPT Make Porn? AI Maker Says It Depends - Decrypt

Leading AI developer OpenAI riled up the tech world and the mainstream press alike on Thursday when it introduced a new model specification that many interpreted to mean that its wildly popular generative AI tools would be allowed to generate not-safe-for-work adult content.“We believe developers and users should have the flexibility to use our services as they see fit, so long as they comply with our usage policies,” OpenAI wrote. “We're exploring whether we can responsibly provide the ability to generate NSFW content in age-appropriate contexts through the API and ChatGPT.”In its announcement, OpenAI also reiterated that its current policy prevents ChatGPT from serving up NSFW content, described as content that would not be appropriate in "a conversation in a professional setting, like erotica, extreme gore, slurs, and unsolicited profanity."Nonetheless, the idea that OpenAI was contemplating lifting restrictions on the creation of pornography raised eyebrows. In retrospect, an Open AI product lead tells Decrypt, the company could have better explained what it was “exploring.”“I think what I would love to do—based on the feedback and the reaction, in the next version we share—is be more precise about what some people's definition of NSFW content and the taxonomy here," OpenAI product lead for model behavior Joanna Jang said, noting that NSFW could mean anything from written profanity to AI-generated deepfake images.As for what specific material would be allowed under a more permissive stance, Jang told NPR that it “depends on your definition of porn.”She stressed that deepfakes are absolutely off the table."Following applicable laws and protecting people's privacy, we thought that would cover it—but we should be clear that we are not in it for creating AI deepfakes or AI porn," Jang told Decrypt. "That is just not something that we even should have the time or bandwidth to be prioritizing when there are more important problems to be solved.”In addition to blocking NSFW content and ensuring legal compliance, the OpenAI model specification includes several other rules that ChatGPT is designed to follow, including not providing hazardous information, respecting creators and their rights, and protecting people’s privacy.Currently, OpenAI’s ChatGPT Plus—which includes Dall-E 3 for images and GPT-4 for text—will not allow users to generate overtly sexual or gory images or text. When asked to do so, ChatGPT will respond that the request violates its terms of service. As a result, Jang points out that the web is rife with complaints from OpenAI users that the company is censoring them."There's a lot of criticism of censorship and what have you, and a lot of that discussion is conflating—to no one's fault—what is OpenAI's policy versus what is actually not our policy,” Jang said. “Are these models behaving that way, even though it goes against the guidelines?"As Jang explained, OpenAI published the spec to lay out ideal model behaviors, focusing on legal compliance and avoiding NSFW content while embracing transparency.“We want to bring more nuance to this discussion because right now—before the model spec—it was, ‘Should AI crate porn or not?’” Jang said. “And I'm hoping that through the model spec, we can actually have these conversations.”Again, this is why I wish I had actually put down [a framework] so that we could have kickstarted this conversation even a day earlier,” she added.For mental health experts, the prospect of popular AI platforms moving into the realm of pornography and adult content is troubling.“In the field of sex and porn addiction, with AI-generated pornography, we are starting to see an increase in addictive behaviors,” Brandon Simpson, a behavioral health specialist at the Men’s Health Foundation, told Decrypt. “Since AI-generated pornography creates the unique and ever-growing intensity needed to fulfill a dopamine response, people are diving in and replacing it with human interactions, which leads to levels of social anxiety, performance anxiety, and a variety of other sexual-related dysfunctions.”Even with guardrails put in place by OpenAI and other major generative AI platforms from Google and Meta, there is strong demand for AI-generated porn, and myriad ways to harness the technology to depict an unsuspecting victim—or generate child sexual abuse material (CSAM)."The spec is only part of our story for how to build and deploy AI responsibly,” an OpenAI representative later told Decrypt. ”It's complemented by our usage policies, how we expect people to use the API and ChatGPT”—ultimately intended to demonstrate transparency and “to start a public conversation about how it could be changed and improved.”OpenAI has invested heavily in improving the privacy and security of its suite of AI tools, including hiring cybersecurity red teams to find vulnerabilities on its platforms. In February, OpenAI and Microsoft announced a joint operation blocking Chinese and North Korean hackers from using ChatGPT, and OpenAI joined with Google and Meta last month in a pledge to prioritize child safety in the development of its AI models.Edited by Ryan Ozawa.Stay on top of crypto news, get daily updates in your inbox.

Zombie Coin to Surge 8,000% After Solana Launch, as it Looks to Challenge Shiba Inu and Dogecoin



                    

Zombie Coin (ZOMCOIN) could become a viral memecoin, like Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE).



Zombie Coin (ZOMCOIN), a Solana memecoin that was launched this week, is aiming to challenge other memecoin giants, such as Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE).




Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Zombie Coin presents a similar opportunity.



Zombie Coin has a market cap below $15,000 at the moment, meaning that when it just reaches a modest market cap of $200,000-$500,000, early investors would generate returns of 2,000%-5,000% in a matter of days or hours.



The exciting memecoin is poised to rally 8,000% in the coming two days, and Zombie Coin could potentially reach a multi-million dollar market cap within a few weeks.




Currently, Zombie Coin can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jupiter and Raydium, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days.



To buy Zombie Coin on these platforms, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Zombie Coin by entering its contract address – FbkoYsCAPbcyJkSoqXTxDKKoGQrYoqgtdLf9GBEqy2vr – in the receiving field.



In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price.



If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner.




The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum.



This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like ZOMCOIN.

Notcoin (NOT) Rides Wave of Excitement as Major Crypto Exchanges Prepare Listings Amid Surging Interest



                    

Notcoin (NOT), a play-to-earn game with an associated token that operates within the Telegram app, is currently making waves on social media platform X. 



This surge in popularity comes as major cryptocurrency exchanges gear up to list the NOT token.




ByBit, a cryptocurrency exchange, officially announced the listing of Notcoin on its platform on May 9, commencing with the immediate availability of deposits. 



Trading and withdrawals for NOT are scheduled to begin on May 16 and May 17, respectively. 



ByBit has clarified that these transactions will be conducted through The Open Network (TON) and its automated trading tool.




Simultaneously, the Binance exchange launched NOT in its launch pool on May 9 and plans to start spot trading of Notcoin on May 16. 



In line with this, Telegram’s third-party custodial crypto wallet, Wallet, will also incorporate NOT into its offerings starting May 16.



Adding to the excitement, the OKX exchange has announced its plan to include Notcoin in its Jumpstart Mining event on May 13. 



This event will allow Toncoin (TON) holders to stake their coins and earn rewards in NOT.




The anticipation surrounding NOT has been mounting on social media, with over 35,000 posts tagged with “#Notcoin” on X at the time of writing.

Introduced in January 2024, Notcoin presents itself as a free play-to-earn game on Telegram. Users can earn the NOT token by simply engaging with the game’s coin icons. 



The token, based on the TON blockchain, was developed by Sasha Plotvinov and his team, Open Builders, who also created the game. 



The game quickly became a sensation on Telegram, attracting millions of players even before its token was available for trading on exchanges like Binance.



Sasha Plotvinov explained the token’s unique position in the market, stating, “Notcoin — or ‘not a coin until it is’ — has solved the issue of attracting Telegram users to crypto,” noting the app’s user base grew to about 30 million in just a few months post-launch.



The official Notcoin Community channel on Telegram now boasts over six million subscribers, and the Notcoin bot reports a player count of 648,015 who have not previously owned any cryptocurrencies.



As for the token’s future, the Notcoin team has expressed uncertainty about its post-listing price but confirmed that the mining phase has been completed.



These developments occur as the TON ecosystem itself is gaining traction. 



Just a day before the ByBit listing, Pantera Capital revealed that its investment in TON was its “largest investment ever,” coinciding with a substantial price increase in Toncoin, which jumped from approximately $5.5 to almost $7 in a week, now trading at $6.88, marking a 27% rise.

VELO, the XRP of Southeast Asia, Skyrockets 358%


VELO has emerged as the latest sensation in the crypto market, earning the moniker “the XRP of Southeast Asia.” 
Over the past six weeks, this crypto has experienced a staggering 358% surge in value, capturing the attention of traders worldwide.
VELO Surged 358% in 6 Weeks
Velo Labs developed VELO, designed to enable digital credit issuance and borderless asset transfers for businesses. The protocol uses smart contracts to facilitate transactions. It provides a secure and transparent way to transfer value across borders.
Much like XRP, which aims to improve the efficiency of cross-border payments, it focuses on enhancing financial infrastructures and enabling seamless remittances. However, what sets VELO apart is its incorporation of smart contracts, a feature that the XRP blockchain currently lacks.

These set of features have allowed VELO to reach a market bottom of $0.0088 within the last 30 days. The token is now up by a remarkable 225.51%. This significant positive gain over the last month contrasts with the current market situation. Indeed, most cryptos continue to shoulder double-digit percentage losses amid the latest bearish downturn.
According to market intelligence platform Santiment, VELO’s trading volume has increased 30% over the past day, climbing to $0.029. Such price performance reflects the growing interest among investors.


“Genuinely, I see only one direction this will go in over the next couple weeks. As a worst case scenario, $0.015 level would need to hold if we get a huge retracement. But for now, VELO showing strength,” a crypto community memeber said.

Several factors have contributed to VELO’s popularity surge. The project has built its ecosystem and formed strategic partnerships. Notable partners include iRemit, Visa, and Lightnet. These collaborations have expanded VELO’s regional reach and demonstrated its potential to enhance cross-border payments and digital finance solutions.

FIT21 Clear For Vote? Revolutionary Crypto Bill Moves to House - DailyCoin


        
The United States House Financial Services Committee is considering voting on FIT21. 



FIT21 could make a big difference in how crypto is regulated, giving much-needed clarity to the industry. 



However, recent interventions by the White House against pro-crypto legislation dampen hopes.
The US crypto industry still finds itself tangled in a convoluted maze of regulatory uncertainty. Despite repeated pleas for clarity, regulators continue to maintain the status quo, running a rampant campaign against crypto companies and driving them away. In a bid to stem the exodus of talent and companies from the country, lawmakers took a decisive step in the summer of 2023 by voting in favor of the Financial Innovation and Technology for the 21st Century Act (FIT21), a crypto bill promising to provide much-needed clarity to regulators and investors. 
After much delay, the crypto bill is finally set to advance to the House floor, marking a pivotal moment for the US crypto industry. Revolutionary Crypto Bill Makes It to the HouseLawmakers with the United States House Financial Services Committee announced on May 10 that they are gearing up for a full floor vote of the FIT21 act. House Financial Services Committee Chair Patrick McHenry suggested that the bill might be up for a vote “later this month” after much consideration in the House Committee on Rules. The FIT21 bill, passed out of committee in July 2023, seeks to clarify how digital assets are regulated by clearly defining the roles of both the US CFTC and the SEC. It is the first time the committee has marked up crypto-specific legislation, with lawmakers highlighting that these bills are necessary to prevent the U.S. from falling behind other countries in regulating crypto. 
“After tirelessly working across the aisle and across the nation over the past year to craft a clear, pragmatic regulatory framework for digital assets, I am proud that this landmark legislation is coming to the House Floor,” said Representative French Hill. “As the collapse of FTX demonstrated, we need strong consumer protections and a functional regulatory framework to ensure the rapidly growing digital asset ecosystem is safe for investors and consumers while securing America as a leader for blockchain innovation.”The act, if passed, could make a big difference in how crypto is regulated, giving much-needed clarity to the industry. However, the impending vote is just one layer of its concerns.A Challenging Course Awaits For FIT21The House is the starting line for the FIT21 act, with a challenging obstacle course waiting ahead. If it manages to clear the House, the bill would need to pass the Senate and then be signed into law by President Joe Biden. However, given the White House’s staunch anti-crypto campaign, hopes remain low. Earlier this week, the US House of Representatives passed a groundbreaking resolution to overturn the SEC’s crypto accounting guidance, which had barred banks from handling crypto customers. However, before Congress could celebrate, US President Joe Biden vowed to stay the course with his anti-crypto stance, pledging to veto any pro-crypto legislation.President Biden claimed that overturning the SEC’s SAB121 act would jeopardize the regulator’s mission to safeguard investors in crypto markets and the broader financial system. Still, despite the looming hurdles for the bill, it is a critical and historic step toward establishing a regulatory framework for digital assets in the US.On The Flipside
Crypto exchange Coinbase’s Stand With Crypto initiative, a political action committee, looks to support pro-crypto candidates in 2024. 



Former President Donald Trump recently rubber-stamped crypto assets, claiming a vote for him for a vote for crypto. 
Why This MattersThe crypto industry has ballooned into an elephant in the room that regulators can no longer overlook. Despite purported efforts by US regulators to rein it in, the industry only grows stronger, attracting institutional and retail interest. FIT21 represents a major leap forward for the industry, offering the potential for much-needed clarity and paving the way for a healthier ecosystem.Is President Biden’s administration destroying crypto?Biden Is “Destroying Crypto”: Cardano Founder Lambasts AdminRead more about FTX’s new Chapter 11 plan:FTX Pens Plan Promising 118% Cash Back to Creditors

Why ShapeShift Founder Erik Voorhees Is Pivoting to a Privacy-Centric AI Startup - Decrypt

Cryptocurrency exchange ShapeShift founder Erik Voorhees announced on Friday the public launch of his latest venture, Venice AI, a privacy-focused generative AI chatbot.Privacy is a critical concern for the cryptocurrency space and among artificial intelligence users—a crucial factor in the creation of Venice AI, he said.“I saw where AI is going, which is to be captured by large tech companies that are in bed with the government,” Voorhees told Decrypt. “And that really worried me, and I see how powerful AI is, how consequential it can be—an amazing realm of new technologies.”Large tech companies are often under the thumb of government and act as gatekeepers to AI, Voorhees lamented, something that could lead us into a dystopian world.“The antidote to that is open-source decentralization,” Voorhees said. “Not giving monopoly power over this stuff to anyone.”Acknowledging the important work done by OpenAI, Anthropic, and Google in pushing the field of generative AI forward, Voorhees said consumers should still have the choice to use open-source AI.“I don't want that to be the only option; I don't want the only option to be closed source, proprietary, centralized, censored, permissioned,” he said. “So, alternatives need to exist.”Voorhees launched the ShapeShift cryptocurrency exchange in 2014. In July 2021, the exchange said it would transition to an open-source decentralized exchange (DEX), with control of the exchange transferring from Voorhees to the ShapeShift DAO.ShapeShift announced in March that it would shut down after becoming embroiled in a battle with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. The exchange agreed to pay a $275,000 fine and abide by a cease-and-desist order to settle allegations that the exchange allowed users to trade digital assets without registering as a broker or exchange with the agency.In the intervening three years, Voorhees said he had turned his attention to building a permissionless, decentralized AI model.Venice AI does not store user data and can’t see user conversations, Voorhees said, explaining that Venice AI sends users’ text input through an encrypted proxy server to a decentralized GPU that runs the AI model, which then sends the answer back.“The whole point of that is for security,” Voorhees said.“[The GPU] does see the plain text of the specific prompt, but it doesn't see all your other conversations, and Venice doesn't see your conversations, and none of it is tied to your identity,” he said.Voorhees acknowledged that the system does not provide perfect privacy—it is not completely anonymous and zero knowledge, but expressed the view that Venice AI’s model is “substantially better” than the status quo, where conversations are sent to and stored by a centralized company.“They see all of it, and they have it all forever, and they tie it to your identity,” Voorhees said.AI developers like Microsoft, Google, Anthropic, OpenAI, and Meta have worked strenuously to improve public and policymaker perceptions of the generative AI industry. Several of the top AI firms have signed onto government, and non-profit initiatives and pledges to develop “responsible AI.”These services ostensibly allow users to delete their chat history, but Voorhees says it's naive to assume the data is gone forever.“Once a company has your information, you can never trust it’s gone, ever,” he said, noting that some government regulations require companies to retain customer information. “People should assume that everything they write to OpenAI is going to them and that they have it forever.”“The only way to resolve that is by using a service where the information does not go to a central repository at all in the first place,” Voorhees added. “That's what we tried to build.”On the Venice AI’s platform, chat history is stored locally in the user’s browser and can be deleted, whether the user creates an account or not. Customers can set up an account with an Apple ID, Gmail, Email, Discord, or by connecting a MetaMask wallet.There are advantages to creating a Venice AI account, however, including higher message limits, modifying prompts, and earning points—although points don't currently serve any function apart from making it easier to track usage. Users looking for more even features can also pay for a Venice Pro account, currently priced at $49 annually.Venice Pro provides unlimited text prompts, removes watermarks from generated images and document uploads, and allows users to “turn off Safe Mode for unhindered image generation.”Despite the MetaMask account integration, Voorhees noted that users cannot yet subscribe to Venice Pro with digital currencies—but said it is “coming soon.” Meanwhile, because it is built atop the Morpheus Network, the company is rewarding holders of the Morpheus token.”If you have one Morpheus token in your wallet, you get a free pro account indefinitely,” he said. “You don't even have to pay, you just hold one Morpheus token and you automatically have the Pro account as long as that token is in your wallet.”As they do with any tool, cybercriminals persistently develop ways to circumvent the guardrails built into AI tools to harness them to commit crimes, whether via using obscure languages or creating illicit clones of popular AI models. However, according to Voorhees, interacting with a language calculator is never illegal.“If you were to go on Google and search for ‘how do I make a bomb?’ you can go find that information—it's not illegal to go find that information, and I don't think it's unethical to find that information,” he said. “What is illegal and unethical is if you build a bomb to hurt people, but that has nothing to do with Google.“That's a separate action that the user is taking. so Venice in particular, or AI is generally, I think a similar principle applies,” he said.Generative AI models like OpenAI’s ChatGPT have also come under increased scrutiny over how AI models are trained, where the data is stored, and privacy concerns. Venice AI collects limited information, like how the product is used—creating new chats, for example—but its website says the platform cannot see or store “any data about the text or image prompts shared between you and the AI models.”For its text generation, Venice uses the Llama 3 large language model, which was developed by Facebook parent company Meta. Customers can also switch between two Llama 3 versions: Nous H2P and Dolphin 2.9.In a Twitter Spaces after the launch of Venice AI, Voorhees praised the work Mark Zuckerberg and Meta have done in generative AI, including making the powerful LLM open source.“Meta deserves tremendous credit for essentially spending hundreds of millions of dollars to train a cutting-edge model and just releasing it for free to the world,” he said.Venice also allows users to generate images using open-source models Playground v2.5, Stable Diffusion XL 1.0, and Segmind Stable Diffusion 1B.When asked if Venice AI would use services from OpenAI or Anthropic, Voorhees’ response was an emphatic no.“We will never provide Claude LLM and never provide OpenAI's service,” he said. “We're not a wrapper for centralized services, we are a way to access open-source models explicitly and only.”With Venice AI built atop the decentralized Morpheus network that powers open-source smart agents, Voorhees acknowledged that there are concerns about Venice AI’s performance. It's something they're focused on, he explained.“If we want to bring private, uncensored AI to people, it has to be roughly as performant as centralized companies,” Voorhees said. “Because if it's not, people are going to prefer the convenience of the central company.”Edited by Ryan Ozawa.Stay on top of crypto news, get daily updates in your inbox.

Top Crypto Exchange Binance To Roll Out Support for New Altcoin Connected to Telegram Game - The Daily Hodl


								Top global crypto exchange Binance plans to launch trading support for a new altcoin connected to a viral game on the encrypted messaging platform Telegram.
Binance plans to roll out support for NOT, a community token for the popular Telegram-based tap-to-earn mining game Notcoin, via its Launchpool platform, which lets users stake coins to farm new assets.










Between May 13th and 16th, Binance users can stake BNB, the crypto exchange platform’s native asset, as well as the stablecoin First Digital USD (FDUSD) into separate pools to farm NOT tokens.
The exchange then plans to list the asset on May 16th. Binance will attach a seed tag to NOT, which the exchange applies to lower-liquidity projects that may exhibit higher volatility compared to other listed tokens.
Binance requires users who own assets with seed tags to pass quizzes every 90 days to ensure they’re aware of the risks before trading the tokens.
Other major crypto exchanges have also announced support for NOT, including Bitfinex, OKX and Bybit.
The token is issued on the The Open Network (TON) blockchain, which was initially developed by Telegram. The messaging platform parted ways with the chain in 2020 following a legal battle with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).
The Open Network, an open-source community of developers, took over management of the technology that year.TON, however, can still be sent by Telegram’s 700 million users within the platform without entering long wallet addresses.

JPMorgan Chase Suffers Data Breach Affecting Personal Information of 451,809 Customers - The Daily Hodl


								JPMorgan Chase says it has discovered a data breach affecting the personal information of nearly half a million customers.
New filings with the Office of the Maine Attorney General show the banking giant recently found a software issue that’s been active since August 26th, 2021.










The bug allowed unauthorized access to retirement plan records of 451,809 customers, which contain names, addresses, Social Security numbers and bank account numbers.
JPMorgan says it now fixed the issue, which erroneously gave full access to several “authorized system users” who were employed by JPMorgan customers or their agents.
The bank says it has no indication that the personal information has been misused, and it’s offering two years of free credit monitoring through Experian to affected customers.
This isn’t the first time JPMorgan Chase has discovered a crack in its security infrastructure.
In 2014, the bank reported one the largest data breaches in history in a cyberattack that affected the accounts of 76 million households and seven million small businesses.
As the New York Times reported, JPMorgan’s security team had failed to add two-factor authentication to one of its network servers, which led to the theft of customers’ email addresses, home addresses and phone numbers. The bank said there’s no evidence that account information was leaked in the hack.

DOJ Chooses Binance Monitor: What It Means for the Exchange - DailyCoin


        
The DOJ has reportedly appointed a monitor for Binance.



Despite previous speculation, the federal agency has not gone with the FTX-linked Sullivan & Cromwell.



The compliance monitorship is likely to have significant impacts on Binance’s operations.
Nearly six months later, Binance, the world’s largest crypto exchange, continues to feel the ripple effects of its $4 billion settlement with the DOJ, and it will likely continue to do so for years to come.As part of the historic November 2023 deal, the firm agreed to three years of supervision under a compliance monitorship arrangement to make sure it does not violate U.S. money laundering rules again. Per a recent report, the DOJ has now decided on the crypto exchange’s supervisor.
Could the DOJ-appointed monitor clip Binance’s wings, or will it be a chance to mend fences with regulators?DOJ Taps FRA Over Sullivan & Cromwell On Friday, May 10, Bloomberg reported that the DOJ has chosen the London-headquartered Forensic Risk Alliance (FRA) as Binance’s compliance monitor, citing anonymous sources familiar with the matter.The decision represents a shift from previous reports suggesting that prominent Wall Street law firm Sullivan & Cromwell were the favorites for the sought-after role. According to Bloomberg, the shift comes as the law firm remains embroiled in controversy over ties to FTX before the exchange’s bankruptcy. FTX creditors have called out the firm for failing to detect the fraud carried out by the defunct crypto exchange’s executives. Meanwhile, Forensic Risk Alliance, a firm founded in 1999 by a team of forensic accountants, data analysts, and former investment bankers, is no stranger to working with the DOJ as compliance monitors. The firm handled the Volkswagen emissions scandal from 2017 to 2020 and the Teva Pharmaceuticals bribery case from 2017 to 2020, among others.
So, what does the DOJ decision mean for Binance?A Significant Change in Pace The DOJ decision means that Binance is about to be faced with increased oversight which could likely slow the pace of its operations. During the three-year period, the exchange will have all its internal policies and agreements reviewed by the monitor to ensure high compliance standards.At the same time, Binance would have to divert significant resources and funds to effectively work with the FRA. As the subject of the monitorship, Binance will have to cover the FRA’s bills, which could run up to millions of dollars. But it is not all bad. By implementing stricter compliance standards, Binance may be able to smooth its relationship with regulators in several jurisdictions where it has faced trouble and eventually expand its global footprint as a result.DailyCoin could not reach the DOJ for comment at the time of publication.On the Flipside 
It is unclear when FRA will start its Binance monitorship.



Binance faces a separate five-year monitorship arrangement under its agreement with the U.S. Treasury. Sullivan & Cromwell is still seen as the leading contender for this bid.
Why This MattersThe DOJ monitorship arrangement could significantly impact how Binance operates. On the one hand, it is likely to slow down its operations and potentially spark a corporate overhaul. On the other hand, it could see the exchange mend relations with regulators around the world, allowing it to confidently expand its global footprint.Read this for more about the Binance monitorship:Will Binance Get FTX Bankruptcy Firm as DOJ Watchdog?See why Franklin Templeton appears bullish on Coinbase’s Base:“Base Season?” Coinbase L2 Earns Institutional Nod: Here’s Why

Mark Cuban advocates for CFTC to regulate 'all crypto' ahead of US election day

Billionaire investor Mark Cuban has pushed for the Commodities Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) to take charge of regulating “all crypto,” along with a final plea to the U.S. Congress to offer clarity for the crypto industry before the 2024 presidential election.Cuban believes that such clarity could potentially help secure another presidential term for Joe Biden. “You could solve this problem for Biden by passing legislation that defines registration that is specific to the crypto industry just as other industries have registration that is defined for them,” Cuban declared to his 8.8 million followers in a May 10 post on X.He further claimed that if Biden isn’t reelected for another presidential term, the SEC and its Chair Gary Gensler, known for their tough anti-stance against crypto, may be held responsible, as crypto voters "will be heard this election."“If Joe Biden loses, there is a good chance you will be able to thank Gary Gensler and the New York SEC,” he added, before suggesting the “better option” of assigning “all crypto to be regulated by the CFTC.”“Crypto is a mainstay with younger and independent voters. Gensler HAS NOT PROTECTED A SINGLE INVESTOR AGAINST FRAUD.”Cuban echoed the argument that has been heard by other leaders in the crypto community in recent times that Gensler has made it “nearly impossible” for legitimate crypto companies to operate within the U.S. due to his enforcement-focused regulatory approach.46 enforcement actions were taken against crypto firms alone in 2023, according to litigation consulting firm Cornerstone Research data.


Meanwhile, CFTC Chair Rostin Behnam believes there is going to be another cycle of enforcement actions within the crypto industry in the next 6 to 18 months.The United States election is set to happen on November 5 and crypto seems to be a key issue for many voters within the country.Related: House votes to nullify SEC’s anti-crypto banking guidance SAB 121On May 7, Cointelegraph reported that in an online poll conducted in April with 1,201 registered voters, more than two-thirds of those surveyed somewhat or strongly agreed that “crypto is for people like them, and more equitable than the financial system.” The Biden administration has faced numerous controversies from the crypto community in recent months.Most recently, Cardano founder Charles Hoskinson claimed it was “unambiguously clear” the Biden administration is trying its best to “destroy the American cryptocurrency industry.”This comes after Biden claimed that his administration plans to veto a joint resolution to overturn SEC guidelines that discourage banks from holding crypto assets in custody.Magazine: How to stop the artificial intelligence apocalypse: David Brin, Uplift author

Banking Giant Wells Fargo Holds Spot Bitcoin ETF on Behalf of Clients, According To New SEC Filing - The Daily Hodl


								US banking giant Wells Fargo is now holding a spot Bitcoin ETF on behalf of its clients, according to a new filing with the SEC.
The bank’s Form F13 filing, which requires institutional investment managers to disclose their holdings, says Wells Fargo is holding 2,245 shares of the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC), which was converted to an ETF in January.










The total value of those shares is $121,207 at time of publishing – a sliver of the firm’s approximately $2 trillion in assets under management.
But the revelation is significant given the resistance that banks have historically shown toward customers who want exposure to the digital asset industry.
This week, the US House of Representatives passed a bill that would overturn SEC guidelines that disincentivize banks from holding crypto by requiring them to list the assets as liabilities on their balance sheets.
The bill passed with 207 votes from Republicans and 21 votes from Democrats, passing 228 votes to 182.
Republican Representative Mike Flood, who drafted the resolution, said it’s designed to “ensure consumers are protected by removing roadblocks that prevent highly regulated banks from acting as custodians of digital assets.”
The Biden Administration has vowed to veto the law if it passes the Senate, saying it could “inappropriately constrain the SEC’s ability to ensure appropriate guardrails and address future issues related to crypto-assets including financial stability.”

What Are Crypto Trading Bots and How to Use Them? | Cryptoglobe


                                
AI and machine learning advancements have greatly enhanced trading bots, enabling them to navigate complex market dynamics and predict trends more accurately. The crypto market’s volatility and profit potential have surged demand for bots, which execute trades faster than humans. 



Crypto bots have become more sophisticated and competitive as demand for cryptocurrency assets soars. With the increased demand, platforms have begun to offer even pre-built, easy-to-set-up bots that cater to varied trading styles, preferences, and necessities.



This article will guide you on everything you need to know about crypto trading bots, including how they work, how to set up or install a pre-built bot, the pros and cons, and much more.



Without further ado, let’s get to it.



How do Crypto Trading Bots Work?



Artificial Intelligence (AI) is the backbone behind crypto trading bots. They use AI to:



Analyze market data and trends and adjust positions based on market conditionsDetect trading signalsManage portfoliosExecute trades based on predetermined criteria or patternsAnd much more



By harnessing AI and machine learning technologies, these bots can process extensive data from diverse sources like social media, news platforms, and cryptocurrency markets to forecast price movements accurately and execute trades accordingly.



In summary, crypto trading bots can make a trader’s life easier by offering several key



functionalities, such as portfolio management, algorithmic order execution, and leveraging insights from market analysis to inform trading decisions.



It’s also worth pointing out some cryptocurrency trading bots are built-in on cryptocurrency exchanges. These are often less advanced systems that allow traders to dollar-cost average (DCA) into a position, automatically buy a token whenever a price drops to specific levels, or bots that trade on grids.



Installing and Using Crypto Trading Bots



Crypto trading bots can be built from scratch using reputable companies’ Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) or bought and installed without too many technical hurdles.



Either way, the integration of AI makes crypto trading bots a valuable resource for traders; they can operate round the clock in a market that never sleeps, execute trades at speeds surpassing human capabilities, and make rational decisions without emotional biases.



Using Pre-Built Crypto Trading Bots



If building your trading bot seems daunting, you can opt for a pre-built solution:



Sign Up: Register for a reputable trading bot platform that offers pre-built bots tailored to different trading strategies.



Set Up the Bot: Follow the platform’s instructions to configure your bot according to your preferred trading strategy. Customize parameters such as trading pairs, risk management settings, and trade execution rules.



Connect Your Exchange Accounts: Link your bot to your exchange accounts by entering the API keys with the appropriate permissions. This will allow the bot to execute trades on your behalf.



Launch and Monitor: Once your bot is configured, launch it and closely monitor its performance, especially during the initial stages. Be prepared to adjust your strategy based on real-time market data and bot performance metrics.



Before choosing a crypto bot, it’s advisable to search for reputable platforms and keep your API keys confidential to protect your assets from potential threats. Always DYOR —do your own research.



Building Your Own Crypto Trading Bot



With the right tools and strategies in place, a well-designed trading bot can help you navigate the complexities of cryptocurrency trading and achieve your investment objectives. To build your crypto trading bot, follow these steps:



Choose a Programming Language: Select a language like Python, JavaScript, or C++ with robust APIs and market data processing libraries.



Integrate Crypto Exchanges: Create exchange accounts, obtain API keys, and enable your bot to interact with exchange APIs for trading.



Define Bot’s Architecture: Plan how your bot will interact with APIs, process data, and execute trades, considering factors like latency and security.



Select a Trading Strategy: Align your bot with a strategy such as arbitrage or trend following, determining its logic and algorithms.



Write and Test the Bot: Code your bot according to your chosen strategy and thoroughly test it using historical data for backtesting.



Connect to an Exchange: Use obtained API keys to set up a connection with your chosen exchange, ensuring necessary permissions.



Deploy the Bot: Launch your bot for trading, closely monitoring its performance and adjusting strategies as needed.



Optimize and Maintain: Regularly optimize your bot with current market data, adjusting strategies and updating software to ensure security and performance.

However, there are risks and limitations associated with these bots. Technical complexity may pose challenges, particularly for beginners.



Security risks exist due to direct asset access, potentially leading to scams or fund losses from malicious codes. Additionally, the volatile nature of cryptocurrency markets necessitates frequent strategy adjustments, and the effectiveness of a bot depends on its programming.

Mastercard Partners with Top U.S. Banks to Explore Blockchain for Streamlined Banking Settlements



                    

Mastercard has partnered with leading U.S. banks such as Citigroup, Visa, and JPMorgan to explore distributed ledger technology for banking settlements through tokenization. 



This initiative, dubbed the Regulated Settlement Network (RSN), aims to unify the settlement processes of diverse financial assets like Treasurys and investment-grade debt on a single platform.




By tokenizing these assets, RSN intends to streamline settlements on a shared ledger, enhancing efficiency across the system.



The testing phase, which follows a 12-week pilot that began in late 2022, originally concentrated on managing cross-border and domestic dollar transactions between banks. 



The current focus has shifted to simulating settlements in U.S. dollars, looking to optimize the efficiency of cross-border transactions while minimizing risks like fraud and errors.

Mastercard’s Raj Dhamodharan emphasized the potential of this technology, stating, “application of shared ledger technology to dollar settlements could unlock the next generation of market infrastructures — where programmable settlements are 24/7 and frictionless.”



As part of the ongoing proof-of-concept trials, the RSN has welcomed new participants, including the USDF Consortium directly, and Tassat Group as a contributor. 



Consulting firm Deloitte has also joined to provide advisory services, with the Securities Industry and Financial Markets Association serving as the program manager.




In total, ten major banking institutions are involved in this pioneering effort, including Citi, JPMorgan, Mastercard, Swift, TD Bank N.A., U.S. Bank, USDF, Wells Fargo, Visa, and Zions Bancorp. 



Additionally, six other entities such as the MITRE Corporation, BNY Mellon, Broadridge, the DTCC, ISDA, and Tassat Group will contribute their specialized knowledge to the project, aiming to reshape how financial transactions and settlements are conducted in the banking sector.

Bitcoin’s big change: Miner volume share drops post-halving and that means... - AMBCrypto



The volume of Bitcoins contributed by miners has dropped since 19 April
This has fueled the low rate at which new Bitcoins are created and entered into circulation

The share of Bitcoin’s [BTC] volume contributed to by the miners on its network has declined steadily since the last halving event, according to IntoTheBlock’s latest finding.  
Bitcoin’s last halving event occurred on 19 April. Aiming to reduce the amount of BTC in circulation, the event halved miner rewards from 6.25 BTC to 3.125 BTC.


 
Due to the reduction in the total amount of coins received by miners on the Bitcoin network, their share of the coin’s total volume often craters after a halving event. 
IntoTheBlock noted further that the decline in BTC miner rewards has also slowed the rate at which new BTCs are added to the coin’s total supply. In fact. the on-chain data provider found that the prevailing inflation rate was around 1.66% on the charts. 
Mining activity on the Bitcoin network
Since the halving event, BTC’s Miner Supply Ratio has dropped slightly, according to CryptoQuant’s data. This metric measures the proportion of new coins added to BTC’s total supply by miners.
When it declines in this manner, the share of new coins being added to BTC’s total supply by miners on the network falls. At press time, the value of this metric was 0.09, having fallen by 0.1% since 19 April.
Source: CryptoQuant
Furthermore, there has been a minor decline in BTC Miner Reserves since the conclusion of the halving event. With a figure of 1.8 million BTC at press time, this has fallen by 0.11% since 19 April.
This metric measures the amount of coins held in affiliated miners’ wallets. Its value indicates the reserves that miners are yet to sell.

Read Bitcoin’s [BTC] Price Prediction 2024-25

This is evidence of the fact that although some miners on the network have sold some off their coin holdings to book profits after the halving event, there has not been any significant selling activity. 
This was confirmed by the drop in the coin’s Miner to Exchange Flow. Assessed using a seven-day moving average, this has cratered by 76% since the last halving event. 
Source: CryptoQuant
Finally, the Miner to Exchange Flow metric measures the amount of BTC flowing from miners to exchanges. When this metric declines, it means that miners are selling fewer coins. 
The decline noted in BTC’s Miner to Exchange Flow revealed that the miners on the coin’s network have continued to maintain a bullish outlook, despite its recent price performance.

Bitcoin Down 20% From March But Glassnode Analysts Are Very Bullish: Here's Why


																Bitcoin might have posted the deepest correction since the FTX crash in November 2022, dipping over 20% from its all-time high of around $74,000. However, Glassnode analysts, while sharing their preview on X, remain cautiously optimistic.

Bitcoin Drops 20% From March High, But Glassnode Is Bullish
Glassnode notes that the Bitcoin “macro uptrend still appears to be one of the more resilient in history” and that though corrections have been made, they are relatively shallow. With this position, the blockchain analytics platform confirms that the coin has improved with liquidity rising, reducing volatility.

Following the correction from March 2023 highs, Bitcoin has struggled to maintain the uptrend. So far, BTC has support at around $60,000, but a key reaction level to watch is $56,500 on the lower side. On the flip side, if prices recover, breaking above $66,000, BTC might rally, even breaching $72,000 and later $74,000.

However, for bulls to find support and prices to rally, triggers would be from fundamental factors. Though price action structure might offer support, price catalysts are, as history shows, related to market events. 
As Glassnode observes, the robust macro trend, bullish for Bitcoin, has tapered volatility, helping maintain the uptrend. The increasingly shallow corrections, as the blockchain analytics platform notes, point to a more mature market backed by more institutions.
Whales Accumulating As Institutions Eye BTC
Confidence remains high. On-chain data reveals that one whale has taken advantage of the relatively low prices and the correction to stack coins. 
In the last week, the whale bought over 100 BTC, pushing the amount of coins bought this month to over 7,257 BTC. This aggressive accumulation suggests that the whale, even at the current multi-year high, Bitcoin could be undervalued.

There could be more Bitcoin tailwinds incoming. For instance, this week, former United States president Donald Trump started accepting crypto donations in the ongoing campaign. This shift of stance has been bullish since Trump dismissed Bitcoin earlier. 
While this happens, European regulators appear open to approving Bitcoin as an investable asset within Undertakings for Collective Investment in Transferable Securities (UCITS) funds. If this goes through, it could unlock more billions into Bitcoin from European institutions. 
This move is massive, considering that banking giants like Morgan Stanley and BNP Paribas are already exploring ways for their clients to invest in BTC.

From a macro level, the rising M2 money supply in the United States amid concerns from the United States Federal Reserve that inflation is high might further buoy Bitcoin demand. BTC, like gold, is considered a safe haven, a hedge against inflation since its supply is designed to be deflationary.

BlockFi Announces Complete Website Shutdown, Selects Major Exchange For Fund Withdrawals | Bitcoinist.com


								BlockFi, a centralized crypto lender, recently shut down its web platform and selected Coinbase as its distribution partner for customer fund withdrawals. The move comes as BlockFi aims to ensure a swift transition for eligible customers following the closure of its platform.
BlockFi Selects Coinbase As Exclusive Partner
According to the company’s press release on the matter, eligible BlockFi clients will have the option to access their crypto withdrawals via Coinbase after the withdrawal request deadline of April 28, 2024. 

Crypto-eligible customers who missed the withdrawal deadline or did not complete an identity verification request by Friday, May 10, will have their assets made available for withdrawal in kind if they create or already have an open and approved Coinbase account. If clients choose not to create an approved Coinbase account, their in-kind distribution may be liquidated to cash as planned.
It should be noted that the crypto lender will exclusively collaborate with Coinbase for crypto distributions and advises clients to remain cautious of potential scams from unauthorized third parties targeting BlockFi clients.
Furthermore, the BlockFi web platform will be permanently shut down in May 2024. The exact date will be communicated separately to clients in the upcoming weeks. 
To ensure the preservation of their transaction history, tax forms, and other important data, BlockFi encourages all clients to download the required information from the platform before the shutdown date. 
Distributions Underway For Wallet Holders
BlockFi’s decision to shut down its web platform follows its filing for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in the US District of New Jersey. The company faced challenges due to the collapse of the Three Arrows Capital (3AC) hedge fund, which impacted its operations. 
However, BlockFi has been actively working to recover funds from FTX and other counterparties, including reaching an agreement with the bankrupt crypto exchange and Alameda Research estates to settle substantial claims.

According to the crypto lender’s founder Zac Prince, BlockFi’s focus remains on recovering as much value as possible for its clients despite the bankruptcy proceedings. 
Prince suggests that distributions have already occurred for BlockFi wallet account holders, with interest account clients expected to receive distributions once funds are recovered from the FTX estate. 
With the ongoing estate distributions and positive trends in FTX estate recoveries, the lender’s founder has expressed a sense of closure and is ready to embark on new professional endeavors. 
Having kept a significant amount of personal crypto at the company, Prince states that he relinquished recovery rights to increase the recovery pool for clients and has committed to providing ongoing unpaid cooperation to support the BlockFi estate.

Ethereum Is Down 30% From 2024 Highs: Why Is This Analyst Super Bullish?


								While Ethereum struggles to regain the Q1 2024 momentum, currently tethered close to the psychological $3,000 level, one trader remains bullish. 
Taking to X, the analyst posts several reasons to negate concerns by skeptics even with the coin trading 30% from March 2024 highs when prices broke above $4,000. By this take, doubts about future gains could be unfounded as they paint an overly pessimistic outlook for the second most valuable cryptocurrency. 
Ethereum Is Under Pressure: Here’s Why
Ethereum is in a bearish breakout formation at press time following sharp losses in mid-April. Although there are hints of strength, the rejection from $2,800 wasn’t enough to assuage fears. 
Ethereum trending sideways on the daily chart | Source: ETHUSDT on Binance, TradingView
As prices range within a $500 zone capped at $2,800 and $3,300, bulls have a chance, though sellers could also press lower, continuing the losses of April.
There are multiple reasons to support the bearish forecast. Some investors, the analyst observes, are still hesitant to get exposure to ETH because of Bitcoin and its swelling layer-2 ecosystems. 

The launch of the Runes Protocol saw activity flow to Bitcoin, pushing transaction fees on the world’s most valuable network. Trading fees have fallen, as seen on YCharts on May 10.

Beyond this, there are concerns that the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) might classify ETH as a security, leading to stricter regulations. Moreover, Solana, a modern high-throughput blockchain, is seen as a stiff competitor considering its surge in activity, mostly from meme coin projects. 
Analyst: Here’s Why ETH Will Rise
Though the threat from Solana and other low-fee and scalable platforms, on top of the United States SEC concerns, is real, the analyst is upbeat. Explaining in a bid to dismantle cause for worry, the analyst dismisses the Bitcoin layer-2 ecosystem as “trash.” Though popular, the analyst thinks it will always be inferior to Ethereum’s in functionality and practicality. 
Beyond this, the analyst adds that though the United States SEC threat exists, it’s unlikely to be successful. Even if it is, powerful political and economic forces like Wall Street will continue to support Ethereum’s growth. 
Thus far, Wall Street players like BlackRock have expressed interest in issuing spot Ethereum exchange-traded funds (ETFs), which has boosted confidence.

Moreover, the analyst downplayed Solana’s strengths, suggesting its scalability and growth might be exaggerated. 
Specifically, the analyst noted the existence of equally superior layer-2 scaling solutions for the Ethereum-like Base. From a security perspective, Solana also has limited client diversity, negatively impacting the network reliability.

Turbo crypto price prediction - Key levels to watch after its 40% hike - AMBCrypto



TURBO rallied by over 40% on Thursday against an overall choppy market 
Market sentiment was positive, but can it drive bulls further? 

Most memecoins decoupled from the broader market and rallied on Thursday. Jumping on the trend, Turbo Crypto, an AI-inspired and frog-themed meme, also surged by over 40% and broke above its recent price consolidation range. 
However, the bullish momentum had tapered off at the time of writing. So, what are the key levels to consider next? 
Turbo crypto price prediction: What are the next targets to watch?
Source: TURBO/USDT on TradingView
A Fibonacci retracement tool was placed between the January lows of $0.0002129 and 2024 highs of $0.001488. The Fib tool revealed that TURBO was range-bound between the 61.8% – 78.6% placeholders of mid-April and early May. 
The memecoin broke above the range during Thursday’s rally, effectively flipping the market structure to bullish. However, despite a slight tapering of upswing momentum at press time, bulls still had the market leverage. 
The RSI (Relative Strength Index) was above average, indicating that buying pressure was still strong. On the contrary, the fluctuating CMF (Chaikin Money Flow) could derail a stronger and sustained upside move because of muted capital inflows. 
Sidelined bulls could wait for a retest on the 50% or 61.8% Fib levels for re-entry positions, with bullish targets at 38.6% or 23.6% Fib levels based on risk profile. 
However, a drop back to the previous range, especially below the blue 50-EMA (Exponential Moving Average), could embolden sellers. 
Turbo price prediction: A liquidity grab in play?
Source: Coinglass
Coinglass’s data showed considerable liquidity on both price extremes. The liquidity map tracks the stop losses of most leveraged traders, and price action tends to move towards these levels to “grab liquidity” before stabilizing. 
If the typical liquidity grab plays out, TURBO could hunt for liquidity near $0.00085 before fishing for more at $0.001 and $0.00115. These levels coincided with the 50% and 23.6% Fib placeholders on the price charts.

These readings mean that $0.00085 could be crucial support, while $0.0011 would be a key bullish target in case of a rebound. The positive weighted sentiment value supported the aforementioned scenario, since more market participants were bullish on the memecoin.

Ethereum Gas Fees Plunge To Lowest Since 2020: Is This The End Of High Costs?


								In a significant development for Ethereum, the average gas fee on the network has dropped to 6.8 Gwei, marking the lowest level since January 2020, as shown by YCharts.
This decrease in gas fees has made all on-chain operations, including asset swaps, cross-chain bridging, and non-fungible token (NFT) minting, considerably more affordable for users.
Ethereum Average Gas Price. | Source: YCharts
Dencun Upgrade Lowers Ethereum Fees
The plunge in transaction fees has impacted several operations on the Ethereum network. For instance, according to data from Etherscan, asset swaps can now be executed for just $7.32, bridging at $2.35, and borrowing at $6.21, while NFT minting is priced at roughly $12.37.

This reduction in fees follows the post-Dencun upgrade, which introduced blobs and optimized network usage. This upgrade sparked curiosity among developers about the potential increase in gas prices should market activity surge.
The Dencun upgrade has notably decoupled Ethereum’s transaction fees from network activity, maintaining low fees even during periods of high usage.
This change benefits users and adjusts the deflationary mechanism set by previous upgrades like EIP-1559 and The Merge.
With this new fee structure, the anticipated pressure from ETH’s burning mechanism has lessened, indicating a shift towards a more inflationary trend in the short term, as lower transaction fees mean less ETH is burned.
Impact on Ethereum’s Market Dynamics And Future Projections
Martin Koppelmann, the co-founder of GnosisDAO, highlighted the current fee dynamics on Ethereum, questioning whether the low base fee and unexplored price discovery of blob fees are the new normal or if the network will experience spikes to over 100 Gwei again.

This uncertainty underscores the challenges in predicting network demand and its implications on fees. Meanwhile, Ultrasoundmoney’s data shows a significant decrease in the burn rate of ETH, with only 521.02 ETH burned in the past day, further evidence of the softened deflationary impact post-Dencun.

The broader market reactions to these developments are mixed. ETH’s price has shown volatility, with an early increase of about 2% to a high of $3,058, followed by a downturn to $2,920, marking a 16% decline over the past 30 days.

As noted by crypto analyst Shin Forex, this price behavior is partly influenced by liquidity dynamics. His ETH/BTC chart analysis suggests that liquidity is moving towards Bitcoin rather than altcoins like Ethereum, leading to a potential decrease in investor interest in Ethereum.

The analyst also observed that the ETH/BTC pair has broken below its support level of 0.05, a pattern that historically precedes a price crash. He predicts Ethereum could spiral to around $2,500 if the ETH/BTC pair falls below 0.04.

Toncoin surges by +17% - Is it time for TON holders to cash out? - AMBCrypto



TON’s price surged significantly over the last 24 hours
Activity on the network grew, while the revenue generated by the protocol fell

Toncoin [TON] turned out to be one of the underdogs of the crypto-market. In fact, over the last few months, TON has outperformed a lot of crypto-assets across various sectors.
TON’s latest rally
Over the last 24 hours, for instance, the price of TON has surged by 17.74%. The price of TON had previously projected a bearish pattern since 11 April. However, the latest hike in its price has been significant enough for a possible trend reversal. The CMF (Chaikin Money Flow) soared over the last few days, indicating that the money was flowing into TON.
On the contrary, the RSI (Relative Strength Index) for TON climbed well above neutral – A sign that it may be in an overbought position and its price could see a slight correction in the future.
Source: Trading View
This can be attributed to, in part, the launch of Notcoin, a community token that onboarded users into web3 through a tap-to-earn mining mechanic.
Despite the surge in price, however, there remain a few issues that are plaguing the token. The network growth for TON, for example, fell significantly over the last few days. This suggested that new addresses have been losing interest in the TON token.
Moreover, the velocity around the TON token also fell – Evidence of the frequency with which TON was being traded having declined.

These factors could prove to be detrimental for TON in the long run and could hinder the altcoin’s ability to rally going forward.

Looking at the data
Furthermore, the MVRV ratio for TON also hiked, indicating that addresses are getting profitable. This incentivizes addresses to sell their holdings which could result in TON’s price being affected negatively.
However, the Long/Short ratio for TON also climbed during this period, implying a hike in the number of long-term holders of TON. Here, it’s worth noting that long-term holders are less likely to sell their holdings and respond impulsively to market fluctuations.
Source: Santiment
In terms of overall activity too, the protocol did well.
Daily active users on the network surged from 175,000 to 270,000 over the last few weeks. Surprisingly though, the revenue generated by the network fell significantly during this period.

Banking Giant JPMorgan Chase Holds $760,000 in Spot Bitcoin ETFs: New SEC Filing - The Daily Hodl


								The biggest bank in the US, JPMorgan Chase, says it now holds about $760,000 in spot Bitcoin ETFs on behalf of its clients.
In a new Form F13 filing, which requires institutional investment managers to disclose their holdings, JPMorgan says the exposure is spread across BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT), the ProShares Bitcoin Strategy ETF (BITO), Fidelity’s Wise Origin Bitcoin Fund (FBTC), the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) and the Bitwise Bitcoin ETF.










The revelation follows a similar filing from rival Wells Fargo, which says it holds 2,245 shares of the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) worth $121,207 at time of publishing.
JPMorgan is also one of the authorized participants powering BlackRock’s Bitcoin ETF, facilitating flows in and out of the fund.
Despite Bitcoin’s sudden adoption on Wall Street, JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon continues to be one of the loudest critics against BTC.
Dimon recently called Bitcoin a pet rock used only by criminals and speculators. When asked if the new ETFs changed his thinking, Dimon told CNBC it was the last time he would comment on the leading crypto asset.
“I don’t care. So just please stop talking about this shit… This is the last time I’m ever going to state my opinion.”

Bitcoin ETFs Soar As 3rd Largest US Bank Reveals Ownership In New Filing | Bitcoinist.com


								In a notable development highlighting the increasing interest of traditional financial institutions in Bitcoin (BTC), Wells Fargo, the third-largest bank in the United States, has revealed its exposure to spot Bitcoin ETFs. 
The US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) approved the regulated index funds in January, allowing institutions like Wells Fargo to invest in the largest cryptocurrency in the market. 
This move signifies a significant entry into the Bitcoin market for the bank, as spot Bitcoin ETFs provide a regulated investment vehicle for institutional investors seeking exposure to Bitcoin’s price movements without directly owning the asset.
Wells Fargo And BNY Mellon Invest In Bitcoin ETFs
According to a recent filing, Wells Fargo holds positions in various spot Bitcoin ETFs. The bank has invested in Grayscale’s spot Bitcoin ETF, the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC), ProShares Bitcoin Strategy futures ETF, and shares in Bitcoin Depot Inc. 

Wells Fargo’s disclosure follows a growing trend among major banks and traditional asset managers investing in spot Bitcoin ETFs. As reported by Bitcoinist, the Bank of New York Mellon Corporation (BNY Mellon), one of the oldest and largest banks in the US, has also revealed its investments in Bitcoin ETFs managed by BlackRock and Grayscale. 
BNY Mellon’s engagement with Grayscale involved purchasing shares of Grayscale’s Bitcoin Trust, while its involvement with BlackRock’s IShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) included acquiring shares of the ETF. These investments, though symbolic in size, highlight the bank’s recognition of Bitcoin’s potential as an asset class.
BlackRock And Fidelity Surpass $10B In Assets In Record Time
The rapid growth and adoption of Bitcoin ETFs are notable. Bloomberg ETF expert Eric Balchunas pointed out that before the introduction of Bitcoin ETFs, the record for an ETF to reach $10 billion in assets was held by the JPMorgan Nasdaq Equity Premium ETF (JEPQ), which took nearly three years. 
However, BlackRock’s IBIT achieved this milestone in 49 days, while Fidelity’s FBTC ETF accomplished it in 77 days. These ETFs have also demonstrated strong trading volume and inflows, indicating the growing interest and demand for Bitcoin investment products.

In sum, Wells Fargo’s disclosure of exposure to spot Bitcoin ETFs highlights the increasing involvement of traditional banks in the cryptocurrency market. As more institutions recognize the potential of Bitcoin and seek regulated investment vehicles, spot Bitcoin ETFs have emerged as an attractive option.

Currently, the largest cryptocurrency in the market, Bitcoin, is trading near the critical resistance level of $61,000, which holds significant importance for the potential growth of BTC.
However, recent market movements have resulted in Bitcoin retracing its gains from the weekend, with a 1.2% price decrease observed over the past seven days. This decline has impacted the cryptocurrency’s short-term performance.

Ethereum's short-term outlook - How high or low will ETH's price go now? - AMBCrypto



Legendary trader Peter Brandt believes Ethereum’s price chart is ‘intriguing’
Ethereum’s price showed signs of recovery, with an increase in new addresses

Ethereum has so far exhibited a volatile mix of price movements, initially dipping below the $3,000-threshold in recent days before rallying above it once again. 
This price behavior has caught the attention of traders and investors alike, with the asset appreciating by a 1.4% in the early hours of Friday. This recovery signifies a pivotal moment for Ethereum as it strives to maintain its momentum above this key price level.
Analyzing Ethereum’s chart patterns and broader market sentiment
Amidst these fluctuations, Peter Brandt, a seasoned trader with decades of experience in the financial markets, took to the social media platform X to express his views on Ethereum’s current price chart, which he described as “intriguing.” His analysis has sparked a wide array of discussions among the trading community.
Brandt’s examination of Ethereum’s price chart revealed two potential patterns – A flag and a channel. Initially, he interpreted the formation as a flag, which is typically seen as a continuation pattern that appears during brief pauses in dynamic market trends. 
However, upon further analysis, Brandt suggested that the pattern might better resemble a channel. 
Source: X
This structure is defined by two parallel, sloping lines, with the price testing each boundary at least twice. Despite the ambiguity in defining the exact pattern, Brandt highlighted the potential for a breakout in either direction, indicating a neutral position towards the immediate future of Ethereum’s price movements.
This neutrality is mirrored in the broader market sentiment. 
For instance, data from Santiment indicated that the sentiment towards top cryptocurrency assets remains “negative,” a trend that has been persistent since the Bitcoin halving took place on 19 April. This episode failed to catalyze a significant increase in market caps across the sector. 
Source: Santiment
This overarching mood suggests that while immediate gains are possible, the market remains cautious about the longer-term prospects.
Signs of recovery and technical outlook
Despite the prevailing bearish sentiment, however, there are signs of potential recovery on the horizon. 
According to Glassnode data, the number of new Ethereum addresses has surged, climbing above 160,000 from its lows below 100,000 earlier in January. 
Source: Glassnode
This uptick in new addresses could be a bullish signal for Ethereum, indicating greater interest and potential investment in the asset, despite its recent struggles.
From a technical perspective, the daily chart for Ethereum still highlighted a bearish trend at press time, with sustained breaks of structure to the downside. However, a closer look at the 4-hour chart revealed that Ethereum could see short-term upward movement. This potential hike could be a strategic move by the market to take out liquidity at higher levels, before continuing the prevailing downtrend.
Source: ETH/USDT, TradingView
Additional analysis from AMBCrypto supported this view, noting increased volatility in Ethereum’s price movements, as indicated by the Bollinger Bands. 
Finally, the Relative Strength Index (RSI) had a reading of 40, reinforcing the strong bearish sentiments in the market.

Phishing Group Returns Stolen Crypto Worth $66.88M to Victim, Collects Bounty! - Coincu



	

Key Points:




Phishing group returns 22,960 ETH ($66.88M) after stealing 1155 WBTC. 



Victim’s 10% bounty incentivizes return of all phished assets. 



Collaboration and swift action lead to successful recovery, highlighting cybersecurity resilience in crypto.




The phishing group responsible for the theft of 1155 Wrapped Bitcoin (WBTC) has made amends by returning all 22,960 Ethereum (ETH) worth approximately $66.88 million to the victim’s address. 





This marks the completion of the restitution process, with all phished assets now safely back in the hands of the rightful owner.



The phishing incident had initially sent shockwaves through the cryptocurrency community, as hackers managed to infiltrate hundreds of addresses and siphon off substantial sums of digital assets. However, the victim, whose identity remains undisclosed, took swift action and engaged with the perpetrators to negotiate the return of the stolen funds.



The resolution of this high-profile cybercrime is attributed to the collaborative efforts between the victim and the phishing group. The decision to return the stolen assets reflects a rare instance of cooperation between cybercriminals and their victims in the cryptocurrency realm.

Victim Recovers 22,960 ETH After WBTC Theft





In a show of goodwill, the victim had earlier announced a 10% bounty for the safe return of the stolen funds. This incentive likely played a pivotal role in incentivizing the phishing group to initiate the restitution process and fulfill their promise to return the pilfered assets.



The successful recovery of the stolen cryptocurrency underscores the importance of prompt action and effective communication in responding to cybersecurity threats within the digital asset space. By engaging with the perpetrators and offering a tangible incentive for cooperation, the victim was able to achieve a favorable outcome and reclaim their lost assets.



While the incident serves as a reminder of the persistent risks associated with online fraud and cyberattacks, it also highlights the potential for constructive resolutions through dialogue and negotiation. As the cryptocurrency ecosystem continues to evolve, proactive measures and collaboration between stakeholders remain essential in mitigating security vulnerabilities and safeguarding against malicious actors.

You’re Wrong About Economics and Why You Should Learn To Love Bitcoin - The Daily Hodl


								
 
You see them on television, in magazines, quoted in the world’s largest newspaper, front and center at bookstores. They’re the economists. The experts.
You trust them. Yet, they are very often wrong, which means everything you know might be, too.
In very recent history, Treasury secretary Janet Yellen and Federal Reserve chair Jerome Powell called inflation ‘transitory.’
Of living American Nobel economists, 16 of 36 stated that “whatever upwards pressure on prices all this new money (i.e., government stimulus) might bring, there was no threat of inflation.”
All were wrong.
Keynesian economics – long meant to be taught in the classroom – has proven over the course of the 20th and 21st centuries to be no more than superstition.
Keynesian championed the idea that you can ‘spend your way out of a recession.’
As we’re seeing today, and as economists such as Ludwig von Mises and Milton Friedman pointed out, government spending and racking up debt eventually leads to inflation, which hurts the poor.
Once the inflation turns to hyperinflation, governments love to institute capital controls – a favorite in the government’s toolkit when currencies begin to collapse.
That means, generally, citizens cannot trade across borders nor use foreign currencies within the country.
Capital controls exist all over the world. Thus, you can’t trade the currency across borders. This is not a sound approach to money.
No wonder the world’s first perfect money – Bitcoin – didn’t come out of academia but rather under mysterious and captivating circumstances, thanks to the genius of Satoshi Nakamoto.










The world needs sound money
More than 100 years ago, during a 1912 testimony in front of Congress, the so-called robber baron JP Morgan said, “Gold is money – everything else is credit.”
Money being a bearer instrument and credit an IOU from a counterparty, which may or may not be honored.
The US Dollar had been pegged to gold until 1973 when Nixon closed the gold window.
According to Mr. Morgan’s view, the world has been operating on credit for 50 years. The dollars in your bank account aren’t backed by gold, after all.
They’re backed by the ‘full faith and credit’ of the US government.
As the Treasury makes clear, Federal Reserve notes are not redeemable in gold, silver or any other commodity and receive no backing by anything.
Redeemable notes into gold ended in 1933 and silver in 1968. The notes have no value for themselves but for what they will buy.
In another sense, because they are legal tender, Federal Reserve notes are ‘backed’ by all the goods and services in the economy.
In order to create money, the Federal Reserve prints money – in other words, it creates credit or debt.
At the top of the dollar bill, it reads, ‘Federal Reserve note.’ The definition of the word ‘note’ is “a written promise to pay a debt.”
From the ashes of the failed fiat and credit experiments, a new paradigm will emerge where, as Michael Saylor notes, Bitcoin is thought of as money and everything else as credit, including CBDCs (Central Bank Digital Currencies).
This is especially true in a climate where individuals and corporations no longer trust in banks and fiat currencies.
The world has long needed sound money, and that sound money needs to work across time and space.
Bitcoin has proven capable of doing so, especially at the layer-two level, perhaps best exemplified by the Lightning Network.
At present, 450 Bitcoins are produced every day. The miners generally have to sell them to cover electricity and to service debt.
If the organic demand is in excess of $12.5 million a day, supply then becomes constrained.
Bitcoin is energy
Economists view money as mediums of exchange, unit of account and stores of value.
What if they got that wrong, too? Perhaps more so than any of the three, money is a form of energy.
When an individual puts energy into earning money and then stores it in an asset that bleeds value over the decades, that individual is leaking energy spent in the past.
Inflation renders his or her economic life on this earth shorter.
More Bitcoins cannot be suddenly printed, thereby rendering everyone’s savings worthless.
For that reason, Bitcoin is hope for a future teeming with freedom, sovereignty, truth and integrity.
Bitcoin takes money out of the realm of deception and into the realm of possibility.

Chainalysis Establishes New Regional Headquarters in Dubai, Expanding Crypto Analytics Across EMEA



                    

Chainalysis, a leader in blockchain data and analytics, recently moved its regional headquarters to Dubai, fostering a deep collaboration with local government authorities. 



On May 8, the company announced that Dubai would now serve as the hub for its operations across Southern Europe, the Middle East, Central Asia, and Africa.




The company’s decision was influenced by a series of strategic partnerships and initiatives that underscore the region’s growing significance in the global cryptocurrency landscape. 



Notably, Chainalysis has been actively consulting with local stakeholders, offering insights on regulatory frameworks to spur innovation within the cryptocurrency sector.



A significant aspect of their involvement includes collaborating with the United Arab Emirates’ Ministry of Artificial Intelligence, Digital Economy and Remote Work Applications. 




Together, they have established an excellence center dedicated to enhancing government employees’ understanding and skills in blockchain technology.



Additionally, Chainalysis has entered into a memorandum of understanding with Emirates NBD on May 6. 



This partnership is designed to support the bank’s Digital Asset Lab program, marking a significant commitment by one of the region’s banking leaders to explore the potentials of digital assets.

Michael Gronager, CEO of Chainalysis, remarked on the proactive approach of the UAE government towards cryptocurrency regulation and innovation. 



He stated, “The true potential and value of cryptocurrencies lies in their ability to transfer value, and we’re seeing an upward trend of overall transfer activity… the UAE is strongly positioned to lead innovation with novel use cases that deliver tangible value to consumers and businesses.”



The strategic location of the new headquarters in Dubai positions Chainalysis to better support emerging markets like India, Africa, and Central Asia. 



Nicola Buonanno, the firm’s Vice President of Southern EMEA, emphasized the UAE market’s pivotal moment, noting that large institutional transfers now dominate the country’s cryptocurrency transactions.



This expansion reflects a broader trend of crypto and Web3-related enterprises gravitating towards Dubai. 



The city’s favorable regulatory environment continues to attract a spectrum of firms, further establishing its status as a technopolis within the Middle East. 



This movement includes significant licenses and approvals, such as Binance receiving a cryptocurrency exchange license on April 18, and QCP Capital’s recent regulatory approval in Abu Dhabi on May 7.

Mark Cuban Blasts SEC Chair Gensler’s Hostile Crypto Probe - DailyCoin


        
Mark Cuban isn’t satisfied with how the SEC has dealt with crypto. 



The billionaire claims the SEC is killing crypto companies. 



Cuban asserted that crypto votes will be pivotal in the November elections. 
There is no denying that US regulators are actively campaigning against the crypto industry, especially after the CFTC recently warned of more enforcement actions to come in the next few months.As the US crypto industry now braces for impact, influential figures like billionaire Mark Cuban are sounding the alarm about the nation’s increasingly adversarial stance, worrying it could derail the crypto ecosystem and tarnish America’s standing in the world. SEC is Killing Crypto Companies, Mark Cuban“If Joe Biden loses, there is a good chance you will be able to thank Gary Gensler and the SEC,”  Mark Cuban asserted in his latest social media response to former President Donald Trump’s open embrace of crypto as part of his presidential campaign. 
The entrepreneur highlighted that crypto has become a mainstay with younger and independent voters; however, SEC Chair Gary Gensler is suffocating the industry with his probe. "All he has done is make it nearly impossible for legitimate crypto companies to operate, killing who knows how many businesses and ruining who knows how many entrepreneurs." Cuban added. Sending a stark warning to Congress, Cuban highlighted that crypto voters would play a pivotal role in the November elections, adding they will be “heard this election.” The Shark Tank investor suggested that President Biden could salvage his dwindling popularity by passing legislation that brings much-needed regulatory clarity to the industry or by designating all digital assets under the jurisdiction of the US Commodity Futures Trading Commission.
However, given the White House’s staunch anti-crypto stance, prospects for President Biden embracing the asset appear increasingly bleak.Will President Biden Warm Up to Crypto?President Biden has made one thing clear in recent years: his distaste for crypto. From dismissing its value to outright vowing to veto any legislation in its favor, his administration hasn’t pulled any punches.President Biden’s anti-crypto sentiment was glaringly evident when the US House of Representatives passed a groundbreaking resolution to overturn the SEC’s crypto accounting guidance, which had barred banks from handling crypto customers. However, before Congress could break out the champagne, President Joe Biden vowed to stay the course with his anti-crypto stance and veto the resolution. Such instances, coupled with the SEC’s aggressive pursuit of crypto enforcement actions, have prompted crypto voters to distance themselves from President Biden. A January 2024 poll revealed that 51% of crypto voters would vote for Trump, with only 41% favoring Biden—a statistic that seems fitting given the former President’s open embrace of cryptocurrencies.At a recent Gala Dinner, President Trump reiterated his pro-crypto stance, promising to prevent an exodus of crypto companies and boldly declaring that a vote for him is a vote for crypto. With only months until the elections, President Trump’s pro-crypto campaign could bear fruit for him as Bitcoin and the overall market shake with excitement. On the Flipside
Crypto policy is not a concern for most voting Americans, as just 17% have invested in digital assets.



Donald Trump’s campaign recently declared its willingness to accept cryptocurrency donations.



A US House Committee is currently considering voting for the FIT21 act, a crypto bill seeking to provide much-needed clarity to the industry.
Why This MattersMark Cuban’s concerns hold weight, particularly given the investor exodus and brain drain caused by the SEC’s stringent regulation. Crypto has become a crucial talking point for voters, and any party—be it Democrat or Republican—that champions the cause stands to gain popularity and potentially secure the elections.What is FIT21?FIT21 Clear For Vote?

Federal Reserve Governor Predicts No Interest Rate Cuts in 2024 Despite Inflation - Coincu



	

Key Points:




Federal Reserve Governor predicts no interest rate cuts in 2024 due to persistent inflation. 



Atlanta Fed President suggests potential rate cuts, despite uncertainty and slow inflation decline.



Diverging viewpoints highlight Fed’s cautious approach amidst economic complexities.




Federal Reserve Governor Michelle Bowman has expressed her stance on interest rates, indicating that she does not foresee any cuts in 2024. 





This assertion comes amidst concerns over persistent inflation witnessed during the initial months of the year.



Bowman’s perspective sheds light on the cautious approach the Fed is adopting in response to the current economic landscape. With inflation showing signs of stubbornness, the Fed seems inclined to maintain its current stance rather than risk exacerbating price pressures through rate cuts.



However, Atlanta Fed President Bostic presents a contrasting viewpoint. Despite acknowledging the ongoing inflationary pressures, Bostic suggests that interest rate cuts might still be on the table for 2024. He emphasizes the uncertainty surrounding the timing and magnitude of potential policy adjustments, indicating a willingness to act if economic conditions warrant it.

Atlanta Fed President Signals Possible Rate Cuts Despite Uncertainty





The divergence in opinions between Bowman and Bostic underscores the complexities facing the Federal Reserve as it navigates monetary policy in a dynamic economic environment. While Bowman prioritizes stability and cautious optimism in the face of inflationary challenges, Bostic advocates for flexibility and readiness to respond to evolving circumstances.



The potential for interest rate cuts, as hinted by Bostic, introduces a level of uncertainty into the market. Investors and businesses alike will be closely monitoring Federal Reserve announcements and economic indicators for clues regarding future policy decisions.



The Fed‘s dual mandate of promoting maximum employment and maintaining price stability requires a delicate balancing act, particularly in the current climate of inflationary pressures and economic uncertainty. As the year progresses, market participants will eagerly await further insights from Fed officials and economic data releases to gauge the trajectory of monetary policy and its implications for the broader economy.

Zombie Coin to Explode 8,000% After Solana Launch, as it Looks to Challenge Shiba Inu and Dogecoin



                    

Zombie Coin (ZOMCOIN) could become a viral memecoin, like Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE).



Zombie Coin (ZOMCOIN), a Solana memecoin that was launched this week, is aiming to challenge other memecoin giants, such as Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE).




Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Zombie Coin presents a similar opportunity.



Zombie Coin has a market cap below $15,000 at the moment, meaning that when it just reaches a modest market cap of $200,000-$500,000, early investors would generate returns of 2,000%-5,000% in a matter of days or hours.



The exciting memecoin is poised to rally 8,000% in the coming two days, and Zombie Coin could potentially reach a multi-million dollar market cap within a few weeks.




Currently, Zombie Coin can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jupiter and Raydium, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days.



To buy Zombie Coin on these platforms, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Zombie Coin by entering its contract address – FbkoYsCAPbcyJkSoqXTxDKKoGQrYoqgtdLf9GBEqy2vr – in the receiving field.



In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price.



If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner.




The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum.



This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like ZOMCOIN.

Bitcoin spot ETFs - Not the catalyst most thought it would be in 2024? - AMBCrypto



Grayscale’s Bitcoin ETF recorded a negative outflow of over $43M, triggering outflows for the other products
However, Bitcoin’s market wasn’t particularly affected by it

It has been a slow month for U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs, once lauded as the big catalyst for a 2024 bull run that might see Bitcoin climbing to as high as $100,000. In fact, just yesterday, the products saw about $11.3 million in outflows, triggered by Grayscale.
Change in investor sentiment?
Data from Coinglass revealed an unsettling trend for Grayscale’s GBTC, which continued to bleed with $43.4 million fleeing the fund. Despite this exodus, GBTC had a brief moment of respite last Friday, with a surprising $60 million pouring in, hinting at its still potent market presence.
Conversely, optimism seemed to sparkle for BlackRock’s IBIT Bitcoin ETF, which welcomed an impressive $14.2 million. This rebound paints a picture of growing investor trust in this particular Bitcoin ETF. Fidelity’s Wise Bitcoin ETF wasn’t left behind either, enjoying a $2.7 million boost.
Bitwise’s BITB ETF also caught the investor’s eye, pulling in $6.8 million and standing out as Thursday’s favorite with $11.5 million in inflows, while its peers lagged behind. Meanwhile, Ark 21shares (ARKB) ETF caught a $4.4 million wave of support on the same day. WisdomTree’s BTCO and Franklin Templeton’s EZBC Bitcoin ETFs saw more modest gains, with inflows of $2.2 million and $1.8 million, respectively.
Source: Coinglass
It was a quieter day for ETFs from Hashdex, VanEck, Valkyrie, and Invesco Galaxy, which recorded no new flows, highlighting a possible disinterest in these Bitcoin ETF products among institutional investors.
Since their inception, these funds have collectively seen an influx of $12.1 billion, with giants like BlackRock’s iShares and Fidelity’s investments capturing the lion’s share. Despite similar performance across the board, with returns hovering around 28%, investor reactions have varied significantly.
The big loser? Grayscale. The fund has witnessed a staggering $17.2 billion withdrawal since its conversion. Even after slashing its fees, Grayscale’s charges remain significantly higher than its competitors, who mostly hover around a 0.20%-0.25% expense ratio. 
Meanwhile, Coinglass revealed that Grayscale still holds nearly 293 BTCs, which are worth $18.4 million.
Source: Coinglass
The outflows in crypto ETF products isn’t isolated to just the United States alone. 
In fact, data showed that Hong Kong’s spot Bitcoin ETFs have seen outflows of over $5.5 million in the past 24 hours, indicating a general loss of interest in the products.
Source: Coinglass
What about BTC?
Amid this, Bitcoin has managed to hold its ground. At press time, the king of cryptos was still managing to hover above $63,000, with a hike of 4% in the last 24 hours. Also, the community is currently 78% bullish on BTC, according to data from CoinGecko.
The Bitcoin halving didn’t yield the results many of us were hoping for and since then, all the top ten cryptocurrencies have been seeing mostly bullish sentiments by investors and sometimes, even traders.
However, with doubts peaking, the ongoing exit of smaller investors might ironically clear the stage for Bitcoin and its fellow cryptos to stage a comeback as summer approaches, hinting at a potential reset in the volatile cycles of the crypto-market.

SEC insists that Coinbase 'just does not like the answer'

The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has opposed cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase's request for an interlocutory appeal concerning a “controlling question” in the ongoing lawsuit, alleging that Coinbase is seeking to manipulate the interpretation of the question itself.“Coinbase’s attempts to manipulate the question for appeal to shoehorn it into a certifiable question under 28 U.S.C. § 1292(b) are self-defeating,” the SEC declared in a May 10 filing with the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York.The SEC further reiterated that Coinbase "does not like" the Howey Test — the agency's standard for determining what is a security — and the current framework for securities regulation, choosing to set up its business in ways that might be expensive to follow existing laws."Coinbase just does not like the answer. Having made the weather, Coinbase cannot now complain that it is raining."It comes after Coinbase filed an interlocutory appeal on April 12 arguing that an investment contract cannot exist without a post-sale obligation. As the SEC disagrees with this, Coinbase allege that whether or not it does so is a controlling question — a key legal issue that can strongly influence the outcome of the case.However, the SEC argued that Coinbase is only claiming this to be a controlling question as the exchange can't provide a clear explanation of what constitutes an "contractual undertaking.""Coinbase remains unable to advance a single, coherent version of this theory, which it now claims presents a controlling question," the SEC asserted.Court filing with the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York. Source: Court ListenerBut the SEC argued that in eighty years, no court has ever demanded "contractual undertakings" after a sale.“Interlocutory review is not warranted simply because Coinbase proposes a new legal test and disagrees with the Court’s rejection of that test,” the SEC noted.“But Coinbase’s decision to do so, and its desire to rewrite settled, decades- old legal precedent to fit its own policy goals and business needs provides no compelling reason to prematurely certify an appeal in this case,” it added.Related: Coinbase faces new lawsuit over alleged investor deceptionThe SEC sued Coinbase in June 2023, saying the crypto exchange violated federal securities laws by listing 13 tokens it alleged were securities.Coinbase argued that the transactions on its exchange shouldn't be considered securities, claiming it falls outside of SEC regulations. However, the SEC holds the opposite opinion.“At least some of the transactions on Coinbase’s platform and through related services constitute ‘investment contracts,’ which the federal securities laws have long recognized as securities,” the SEC stated in March 27 court documents.Magazine: How to stop the artificial intelligence apocalypse: David Brin, Uplift author

Crypto Supporter Mark Cuban Challenges SEC On Crypto In 2024 Election - Coincu



	

Key Points:




Crypto supporter Mark Cuban warns of crypto’s significance in the 2024 election and condemns SEC Chair Gary Gensler’s regulatory approach.



A poll reveals that most crypto voters support Trump over Biden, despite concerns about Biden’s anti-crypto sentiment and SEC enforcement actions.




Crypto supporter Mark Cuban has fired back at former 2024 Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump over his recent embrace of cryptocurrencies, predicting their pivotal role in the upcoming 2024 election.





Crypto Supporter Mark Cuban Challenges SEC Ahead of 2024 Election



Cuban took to social media to voice concerns about the nation’s increasingly hostile attitude toward the crypto industry, cautioning that it could jeopardize both the sector’s growth and America’s global reputation.



Accusing Securities and Exchange Commission Chairman Gary Gensler of neglecting investor protection and hindering legitimate crypto businesses, Cuban warned Congress of the impending influence of crypto voters in the next election cycle. A January poll indicated that 51% of cryptocurrency voters are in favor of Trump as a presidential candidate, although opinions on congressional races vary.



Crypto supporter Mark Cuban echoed sentiments expressed by other crypto leaders, criticizing Gensler’s regulatory approach for stifling innovation and driving legitimate companies out of the U.S. market. He urged Congress to intervene, proposing that the Commodities Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) take the reins in regulating all crypto activities to provide much-needed clarity and support for the industry.




Cuban Urges Congressional Action for Crypto Clarity



Meanwhile, Trump announced his willingness to accept cryptocurrency donations for his campaign, while memecoins inspired by him and President Biden saw a surge in value on May 9.



President Biden’s recent resistance to crypto-friendly measures, including his veto of a resolution overturning SEC crypto accounting guidance, has further alienated crypto voters. The rift is evident in polling data, with a majority of crypto voters leaning toward Trump, aligning with his pro-crypto stance.

Crypto Trader Turns $6,500 into $5.6 Million with Astounding 85,000% Gain | Cryptoglobe


                                
A cryptocurrency trader has managed to score an 85.000% gain trading a little-known cryptocurrency using two wallets. Effectively turning $6.500 into $5.6 million while doing so, significantly outperforming the wider cryptocurrency market.



According to data from on-chain analytics firm Lookonchain, the cryptocurrency trader with the Ethereum Name Service domain “waxl.eth,” has managed to score their 870x gain after spending $6,500 to buy 2.08 million worth of $TRUMP tokens using two wallets.



The trader sold 1.24 million TRUMP tokens for $902,000, having around 832,000 tokens left after their sale, with these being wroth around $4.7 million. The trader, according to Lookonchain, also made more than $1.23 million on $BASEDAI.



The blockchain analysis service noted that the trader spent $4,000 to buy 249,000 $BASEDAI tokens, and sold 19,500 of those for $137,000 after its price exploded while still keeping 238,000 worth over $1.1 million in their wallet.







As CryptoGlobe reported, recent trading activity suggests that memecoin traders are currently betting on cryptocurrencies referring Presidential candidate Donald Trump, with significant whale transactions pointing to that shift over tokens referring to current US President Joe Biden.







            
            

            
            

            
            

        

The change came after Trump endorsed the cryptocurrency space. Which some see as push for cryptocurrency businesses to relocated to the United States, after he emphasized the need for a regulatory environment encouraging the growth ad stabilization of the cryptocurrency market.



According to on-chain analysis service Lookonchain, a notable transaction involved the sale of 49,253 “Jeo Boden” ($BODEN) tokens and the purchase of 50,797 “Doland Tremp” ($TREMP) tokens.



This activity might indicate that crypto traders, or ‘whales,’ are speculating on a rising favorability towards Trump-related digital assets compared to those associated with Biden.



These trades also come after Trump recently suggested President biden “doesn’t even know” what cryptocurrency is, and suggested that cryptocurrency advocates should vote for him instead, implying further support for the space.

JPMorgan Chase Bitcoin ETF Investment Reported With $760,000 - Coincu



	

Key Points:




JPMorgan Chase, the largest US bank, discloses exposure to spot Bitcoin ETFs in an SEC filing totaling around $760,000.



Despite CEO Jamie Dimon’s past skepticism, the move marks JPMorgan’s entry into the cryptocurrency market.



The JPMorgan Chase Bitcoin ETF investment aligns with a broader trend of traditional financial institutions embracing cryptocurrency.




JPMorgan Chase, the largest bank in the United States, has unveiled its exposure to spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) in a recent filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).





JPMorgan Chase Bitcoin ETF Investment Revealed



The filing, submitted on May 10, reveals that JPMorgan Chase Bitcoin ETF investments were provided by industry giants such as Grayscale, ProShares, Bitwise, BlackRock, and Fidelity.



According to the SEC document, JPMorgan’s holdings include ProShares Bitcoin Strategy ETF (BITO), BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust Fund (IBIT), Fidelity’s Wise Origin Bitcoin Fund (FBTC), shares of Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC), and shares of Bitwise Bitcoin ETF, totaling approximately $760,000 in value.



While the disclosed amount may seem modest compared to other institutional investments in Bitcoin, it signifies JPMorgan’s entrance into the cryptocurrency market, a move that contradicts CEO Jamie Dimon‘s public skepticism toward Bitcoin.




Moreover, JPMorgan also reported holdings in Bitcoin Depot, a Bitcoin ATM provider valued at approximately $47,000 for 25,021 shares. These disclosures indicate the bank’s growing involvement in the cryptocurrency space.



Traditional Banks Embrace Cryptocurrency Investments



The news of JPMorgan Chase Bitcoin ETF investment comes amid increasing interest from traditional financial institutions in cryptocurrency. Wells Fargo, the third-largest bank in the US, also revealed its exposure to Grayscale and ProShares Bitcoin ETFs on the same day.



As spot Bitcoin ETFs gain traction in the finance sector since their approval earlier this year, institutions like JPMorgan and Wells Fargo are positioning themselves to capitalize on the growing popularity of digital assets. However, observers are cautioned not to assume the accuracy and completeness of the information provided by these financial firms, as noted by the SEC.

Analysts Predict June Could Mark Local Bottom for Altcoins, Signaling Potential Bull Cycle Start



                    

In the article about the cryptocurrency market, it’s noted that while Bitcoin remains separate from these predictions, the broader altcoin market might be approaching a pivotal moment. 



According to experts, altcoins are expected to find their local bottom in June, potentially marking the beginning of a new bull cycle for these cryptocurrencies.




The analyst Rekt Capital shared insights on X on May 8, stating, “Altcoins are following the plan perfectly. Altcoins bottomed in early February. Altcoins sold off around the BTC Halving. 



“Altcoins to bottom early summer.” 



This timing coincides with historical trends in the altcoin market, which often sees shifts around these periods.




Despite a rough past month where altcoin market cap (excluding the top ten cryptocurrencies) plummeted over 21% to $265 billion, there is a broader perspective to consider. 



Year-to-date, the altcoin market cap has increased by more than 24%, and over the past year, it has surged over 167%.



The correlation between altcoin sentiment and Bitcoin prices is significant, as highlighted by blockchain adviser Alex Onufriychuk from Qubic Labs Accelerator. 



He told Cointelegraph, “There is a possibility that they could find their local bottom by June due to the lack of sufficient new liquidity from Bitcoin ETFs in the U.S. and Hong Kong. 




This indicates that the consolidation period may be prolonged.”

Aurelie Barthere, a principal research analyst at Nansen, pointed out that the behavior of Bitcoin is crucial for altcoins to thrive. 



“Altcoins are high beta crypto, they are successful when the sentiment is very bullish. Since mid-March, the sentiment among crypto investors is less exuberant. 



As BTC price consolidates around the 20-day exponential moving average, there is more volatility in alts. 



We need a break above and a clear resumption of BTC uptrend for alts to outperform.”



Furthermore, Alex Onufriychuk added, “Even if altcoins find their local bottom around June, it does not necessarily mean that a bull run will start. 



For a significant turnaround, more fundamental changes are required, such as increased retail and institutional investment and favorable regulatory developments, given the scarcity of new liquidity and heavy reliance on institutional reinvestment into newer projects.”



In addition, the broader economic environment might influence altcoin markets. 



For instance, the M2 money supply turned positive year-over-year for the first time since November 2023, suggesting that investors may begin seeking hedges against inflation or alternative investments, potentially benefiting altcoins and memecoins and marking the onset of “altszn.”

Coinbase's Appeal Request Now Opposed by SEC - Coincu



	

Key Points:




The SEC rejected Coinbase’s appeal request regarding applying traditional securities rules to cryptocurrencies.



The dispute centers on whether cryptocurrencies meet the Howey Test for securities, with the SEC suing Coinbase for listing tokens without regulatory approval.



Coinbase’s attempts to challenge SEC regulations face hurdles as the court finds their arguments lacking.




The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has firmly rebuffed cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase’s plea for an interlocutory appeal regarding the application of traditional securities regulations to digital assets.





SEC Rejects Coinbase’s Appeal Request on Cryptocurrency Regulation



Coinbase’s appeal request to the court, seeking a review of whether conventional securities rules, notably the Howey Test, are pertinent to cryptocurrencies, was dismissed by the SEC. The regulatory body contended that Coinbase’s aim was to manipulate the interpretation of the issue itself.



The crux of the matter lies in the SEC’s accusation that Coinbase functions as an unregistered broker, exchange, and clearinghouse in the U.S., particularly concerning the trading of certain cryptocurrencies considered securities under the Howey Test. 



The SEC initiated legal action against Coinbase in June 2023, asserting that the exchange violated federal securities laws by listing 13 tokens deemed securities without regulatory approval.




Coinbase Faces Regulatory Hurdles in SEC Dispute



While Coinbase argues that its transactions should not be classified as securities and fall outside SEC regulations, the regulatory authority maintains the contrary stance. However, Coinbase’s appeal request has been thwarted as the court found their arguments lacking in consistency and failed to demonstrate the existence of decisive issues.



The ongoing legal battle underscores the broader regulatory uncertainty surrounding the cryptocurrency industry and the applicability of traditional securities laws to digital assets. With Coinbase’s intermediate appeal motion pending a ruling from the presiding judge, the outcome could have significant implications for the regulatory landscape governing cryptocurrencies in the U.S.

SEC’s Policies Will Not Protect Investors from Fraud: Mark Cuban


							

Mark Cuban criticizes the SEC and its Chair, Gary Gensler, for their stringent regulatory policies.



Cuban asserts that Gensler hasn’t introduced any law that could protect investors from fraud.



The television person requests Congress for regulatory clarity and suggests CFTC take over control of the market regulation.




In response to Republican Presidential candidate Donald Trump’s public embrace of cryptocurrencies, American television personality Mark Cuban spotlighted the necessity of clear crypto regulations. Cuban criticized the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and Chair Gary Gensler for their stringent and non-comprehensive regulatory policies.







Cuban pointed out that cryptocurrencies have become a “mainstay with younger and independent voters.” However, he added that the SEC hasn’t introduced any policies that could protect investors from fraud. Further slamming Gensler, Cuban asserted,




“All he has done is make it nearly impossible for legitimate crypto companies to operate, killing who knows how many businesses and ruining who knows how many entrepreneurs.”




Recently, Trump promised the crypto investors a “good and solid” crypto industry, arguing that Biden doesn’t even know what crypto is. Criticizing the SEC and the Democrats for their alleged anti-crypto stance, Trump assured that he wouldn’t use regulatory power to crush the industry.









In his X post, Cuban requested Congress to bring regulatory clarity to the industry before the 2024 Presidential election. Believing that such a move could secure another Presidential term for Biden, he stated, “You could solve this problem for Biden by passing legislation that defines registration that is specific to the crypto industry just as other industries have registration that is defined for them.”



Moreover, as a final solution to the regulatory challenges in the crypto market, Cuban suggested the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) take control of the industry. He asserted, “They [CFTC] actually know what they are doing.”

Ark 21Shares Ethereum ETF Now Drop Staking ETH Proposal - Coincu



	

Key Points:




ARK 21Shares Ethereum ETF is based on this, excluding proof of stake due to SEC concerns about its classification as a security.



Analysts downgrade SEC approval chances from 70% to 25%, citing regulatory uncertainties surrounding Ethereum and staking.




In a recent development concerning the proposed Ethereum exchange-traded fund (ETF) by ARK Invest and 21Shares, the companies have made amendments to exclude proof of stake from the fund. The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) raised concerns regarding staking, considering it a security, prompting the revision.

Ark 21Shares Ethereum ETF Proposal Amended: PoS Exclusion Raises Regulatory Concerns



Initially, ARK Invest and 21Shares had included staking options for ARK 21Shares Ethereum ETF in their filing documents, but the latest amendment removed this feature. Analysts have adjusted their outlook on SEC approval, with one lowering the chance from 70% to 25%.



The SEC’s stance on staking, considering it a security, has dimmed the prospects of spot Ethereum ETF approval. SEC Chairman Gary Gensler‘s inclination to classify ETH as a security adds further uncertainty. Notably, the deadline for SEC ruling on the Ethereum ETF proposals is May 23, but industry experts anticipate rejection.




The ARK 21Shares Ethereum ETF, filed in September 2023, aims to provide investors direct access to ether on the Cboe BZX Exchange, utilizing the CME CF Ether-Dollar Reference Rate. 21Shares functions as the trust sponsor, with Delaware Trust Company as trustee and Coinbase Custody Trust Company as the ether custodian. ARK Investment Management supervises the fund.



Industry Experts Predict SEC Rejection for Ethereum ETF Proposals



Despite the revised documents hinting at discussions between the SEC and ETF applicants, the reasons for changes remain undisclosed. The revised approach underscores a strategic adjustment to enhance SEC compliance.



While ARK Invest and 21Shares have not commented on the amendments, the evolving regulatory landscape around Ethereum and staking presents challenges for ETF approval, dampening earlier optimism among industry observers.

Trader Who Nailed 2022 Bitcoin Meltdown Says Ethereum Rival With ‘Strong Fundamentals’ Could Surge by up to 170% - The Daily Hodl


								A widely followed cryptocurrency trader who accurately predicted Bitcoin’s (BTC) collapse to under $30,000 in 2022 is naming a blue-chip altcoin that he thinks possesses big upside potential.
The trader pseudonymously known as Capo tells his 841,700 followers on the social media platform X that if Polkadot (DOT) manages to stay above a key support level at $6, the Ethereum (ETH) competitor could skyrocket as much as 172% from its current levels.










“DOT.
Currently at major support again, after being rejected from resistance. If this support holds, we should see a move up to the same resistance ($10 to $11) and if this level is broken, then it should reach $15 to $17.”
Source: Capo/X
Polkadot is trading at $6.25 at time of writing.
According to Capo, his bullish thesis for Polkadot is bolstered by the crypto project’s progress.
“Some strong fundamentals for Polkadot:
– Polkadot 2.0
– Parachains
– Polkadot gaming (migration of Mythical Games)
– AI (artificial intelligence) integrations like Phala Network (PHA).”
Polkadot 2.0 refers to the key changes the network has introduced to enhance functionality and efficiency. Phala Network (PHA) is an artificial intelligence co-processor for blockchains.
Meanwhile, web3 gaming developer Mythical Games announced plans to pivot from Ethereum to Polkadot months ago.
Turning to Bitcoin, Capo says that the flagship crypto asset is at an “interesting support zone” where it could form the base for an upside move.
“There is strong demand at $59,000 to $61,000 and indicators look mostly bullish, so a bounce is likely. If BTC breaks the $65,000 resistance, I’d be looking for $68,000 to $69,000 as the first target, and $74,000 to $75,000 as the second target.”

How soon can AVAX reach $100? Decoding the altcoin's rise - AMBCrypto



Data from the derivatives market showed that shorts dominated the positions.
A golden cross on the daily chart suggested an increase to $60 in the near term.

Avalanche’s [AVAX] price increased to $35.77 has once again sparked speculation that the token could hit $100. This recent rise was a 4.30% 24-hour jump.
However, it was still not close to the $61.90 ceiling that the cryptocurrency reached in March.
Despite that, some key indicators suggested that the token might continue its upward run. Firstly, AMBCrypto considered the Funding Rate.
Funding Rate is the cost of holding an open position in the derivatives market. A positive reading of the Funding Rate implies that longs are paying shorts to keep their positions open.
Traders to lose, AVAX to gain
In this case, most bets tilt toward the bullish side. However, negative funding suggests that most traders placed bearish predictions with shorts paying longs.
For context, a long is a trader expecting the price of an asset to increase. On the other hand, a short is one predicting a price decline while hoping to profit from it.
At press time, the aggregated Funding Rate on exchanges was -0.001%.  The negative funding while AVAX’s price increases imply that shorts are aggressive.
Source: Santiment
However, they are not being rewarded for their positions. Furthermore, the price increase suggested that spot buyers are on the aggressive end, and this could be bullish for AVAX.
Should the metric remain this way, then the price of the cryptocurrency might attempt to surpass $40 in the short term. From the daily chart, the Money Flow Index (MFI) reading increased.
The MFI shows if capital is flowing into a cryptocurrency or not. If the MFI sustains the increase, and trader do not take their liquidity out of AVAX, then the price might continue to increase.
$100 is coming but not now
AMBCrypto also noticed a support at $32.77, indicating the bulls formed a support and were defending it. On the broader outlook, the 50 EMA (blue) had crossed over the 200 EMA (yellow).
This crossover is termed a golden cross, suggesting that the mid to long-term outlook for AVAX was bullish. With this trend, the price of the token might key into the $60 resistance in the mid-term.
Source: TradingView
Further, AVAX bulls might try to push the price toward the three-digit level. But this might only become plausible in some months, not in a few weeks.
In terms of Open Interest (OI), Coinglass data showed that there was a slight increase. This increase implied that traders have begun to increase more positions to make gains from the price action.
Source: Coinglass

If the OI continues to increase alongside the price action, AVAX’s price might hit a weekly high before this weekend comes to a close.
So, the $100 prediction remains an option for the token. But this could later on in the year or next.

Coinbase’s Motion For Interlocutory Appeal Should Be Rejected, SEC Argues | Bitcoinist.com


								The United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has responded to Coinbase’s recent motion, as the legal battle between the regulator and the prominent cryptocurrency exchange heats up. The US-based exchange filed an interlocutory appeal in April after a judge denied its request for case dismissal.
In June 2023, the SEC sued Coinbase, the largest crypto exchange by trading volume in the United States, for operating as an unregistered securities exchange, broker, and clearing agency. In the latest development, the SEC has asked the court not to allow the exchange to appeal.
No Substantial Ground For Difference In Opinion: SEC
On Friday, May 10, the Securities and Exchange Commission submitted its response to Coinbase’s recent interlocutory appeal. The US financial regulator argued that the exchange’s motion should be denied irrespective of “which version of the question for certification Coinbase proposes.”

In its motion for an interlocutory appeal, the exchange claimed that there is a “substantial ground for difference in opinion” about the application of the Howey Test, which is used to determine if an asset qualifies as an investment contract and security. The SEC addressed this in its filing, saying:
More broadly, it is clear that Coinbase does not like Howey and the current framework for securities regulation, having decided to arrange its business affairs in ways that may make it costly to comply with existing law. But Coinbase’s decision to do so, and its desire to rewrite settled, decades old legal precedent to fit its own policy goals and business needs provides no compelling reason to prematurely certify an appeal in this case.
Judge Katherine Polk Failla, who denied Coinbase’s motion to dismiss the SEC’s charges, will have to rule on the motion for interlocutory appeal. If she approves the request, then the exchange will be able to send the motion to the US Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit.
“Let’s Have An Honest Conversation” – Coinbase CLO Responds
Paul Grewal, Coinbase’s chief legal officer (CLO), took to the X platform to tackle the SEC’s response to the interlocutory appeal motion. Grewal called out the regulatory agency for contradicting its legal arguments in similar cases.


Specifically, the CLO highlighted the differences in the SEC’s argument in a similar appeal in its case against Ripple. Grewal added: 
Let’s at least have an honest conversation. Forget about a split across agencies, circuits and elsewhere. There’s not even a consensus about Howey and digital assets among the district judges in the same courthouse at Foley Square.

While this latest motion and a potential interlocutory appeal might prove pivotal in this legal showdown, it remains to be seen how this case will play out. Moreover, the US SEC and Coinbase have other ongoing court battles, most notably the exchange’s lawsuit against the commission for failing to provide regulatory clarity.

Shiba Doge Hybrid Will Surge 8,000% Ahead of MEXC Listing, as Shiba Inu and Dogecoin Struggle



                    

Shiba Doge Hybrid (SHIDOGE) could turn early investors into multi-millionaires if it becomes a mainstream coin, like Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE).



Shiba Doge Hybrid (SHIDOGE), a new Solana memecoin that was launched this week, is poised to explode over 8,000% in price in the coming days.




This is because SHIDOGE has announced its first centralized exchange listing, which will be on MEXC.



This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up.



Currently, Shiba Doge Hybrid (SHIDOGE) can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jupiter and Raydium, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days.




Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Shiba Doge Hybrid (SHIDOGE) could become the next viral memecoin.



To buy Shiba Doge Hybrid on Raydium or Jupiter ahead of the MEXC listing, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for SHIDOGE by entering its contract address – 797CmcxqkLZaSjMd7MdyNZ9swuSzaGdYWkJ65jehiXWa – in the receiving field.



In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price.



If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner.




The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum.



This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like SHIDOGE.

Ethereum Gas Fees Hit Lowest In Four Years


							

Ethereum’s average gas price hit 6 Gwei, its lowest since January 2020.



Martin Köppelmann questioned the sustainability of this trend.



The decline in gas fees is attributed to the Cancun-Deneb upgrade and reduced on-chain activity.




Ethereum network witnessed a significant decline in its intraday average gas price, plunging to 6 Gwei. According to Etherscan metrics, this figure marks its lowest point since January 2020. On the other hand, this drop in gas fees translates into remarkably affordable on-chain operations for Ethereum users. 



Co-founder of Gnosis, Martin Köppelmann, commented on the development, questioning the ongoing trend. “Ethereum base fee is at record lows. The blob fee still has not even entered price discovery (with a very short exception) and thus is at absolutely 0.



Is this the new normal or will we see periods of +100 GWEI again and by what demand will they be driven?” Köppelmann stated.



Recent observations attribute the decline in gas fees to the combined effects of the Cancun-Deneb upgrade and a downturn in on-chain activity within the Ethereum network. 



With the cryptocurrency markets experiencing relative calm and an overall modest uptick, various usage metrics have decreased accordingly. Meanwhile, reports indicate that Ethereum’s supply has even relinquished its deflationary status, which these factors have influenced.









As a result of these developments, users can now execute asset swaps on Ethereum for a mere $5 commission. At the same time, cross-chain bridging services are available at a nominal $2 fee. Furthermore, the minting of non-fungible tokens (NFTs) on Ethereum comes at an accessible cost of $9.



The USD gas fees recorded today are the lowest observed in the past six months, with the last comparable instance recorded in November 2023. Alongside this, the cost of Ethereum transactions decreased by 93%, from $30 to $2, per insights from BitInfoCharts.



On May 9th, Vitalik Buterin, Ethereum’s founder, proposed substantially upgrading the platform’s gas mechanism. This upgrade unveils the concept of multi-dimensional gas and provides Ethereum with enhanced flexibility in managing various resources.



The proposal is also predicted to improve Ethereum’s throughput capabilities without compromising safety. This suggested enhancement signifies the evolution of the Ethereum ecosystem and its increasing utilization.

FIT21 Bill Advances: Congress Moves Closer to Clarifying Crypto Regulations

United States House Financial Services Committee will push a major legislative move toward the Financial Innovation and Technology to the 21st Century Act, known as the FIT21, which will be debated on the floor session. This law is designed to make it clearer what role the two U. S.  bodies, the CFTC and the SEC, have in the regulation of digital assets, especially the way they provide guidance that applies to digital assets.  It has been in the making since July 2023.  Overview of FIT21 bill The FIT21 bill, which was mainly championed by Congressman Patrick McHenry and French Hill from the House Financial Services Committee, is being proposed to set up a crypto strategy between the relevant US agencies. The main duties of this reform are to increase the CFTC’s jurisdictional scope in order to gather together cryptocurrency products and make more precise the SEC’s jurisdiction over numerous cryptocurrency-related matters. This move is concurrent with a growing need for the regulatory supervision of the digital asset world which is not only swiftly developing but expanding. Passing the FT21 bill to full floor level, voting shows the Bank of Congress that they can work together to find the regulate the sources of digital assets’ confusion. Crypto bipartisan bill.  Republican and Democratic politicians have remained strong supporters of the measure, which underscores the need for consumer protection and market certainty as the crypto ecosystem continues developing. Nevertheless, priority on the House’s side can’t be guaranteed as the bill must pass the other chamber and then be approved by President Joe Biden to take effect. Crypto industry embraces regulatory progress  While industry players found the attempts towards regulatory clarity very good, now they can plan more effectively and decide how to integrate the technology into their businesses. Sheila Warren, the Chief Executive of the Crypto Council for Innovation, observes that though some cracks are seen in the FIT21, it represents a significant step towards coming up with an established federal framework for digital assets. This notable announcement by one of the leading players in the crypto industry epitomizes the increasing awareness and shared understanding of the need for clarity in regulatory practices to spur innovation while ensuring safeguards for investors’ welfare in the space. Political sphere on crypto regulations  Digital assets regulation, which has been the main theme of the United States’ elections during its middle period, is of great importance. Those candidates who are running for reelection thus lately turned more towards substantial policy changes in terms of regulatory framework intervention to tackle the problems such as consumer protection, financial stability, and national security with cryptocurrencies in mind. Speaking of emphasis, one would not overlook Coinbase’s political action committee, Stance With Crypto, in this regard, which is part and parcel of this platform with the aim of creating an atmosphere conducive to candidates that favor pro-crypto politics. With incumbent Congressman Patrick McHenry, who has won two years’ time of his position, making the decision not to pursue a third term, this adds an advantage, a mystery, or even a value to the unknown surrounding cryptocurrency´s regulation of the institutional environment. McHenry, who over his time has always displayed crypto-oriented legislative activities and hence a commitment to nonpartisan regulation, must go on to provide those changes that will further prompt an environment in regulators that is inclusive and collaborative.

Binance to be under FRA surveillance for next 3 years: Report

The United States Department of Justice (DOJ) has reportedly appointed international consultancy firm Forensic Risk Alliance (FRA) to ensure cryptocurrency exchange Binance complies with regulatory requirements over the next three years, according to sources familiar with the matter.Appointing a third-party firm to monitor the exchange’s compliance over the next three years was a key requirement of Binance's plea deal in November 2023, where it pleaded guilty to money laundering and other federal charges, along with a $4.3 billion fine.FRA will have access to internal records, premises, and employees to provide the DOJ with updates on the company's activities, according to a May 10 Bloomberg report.Law firm Sullivan and Cromwell were reportedly initially first in line for the contract, but the firm's prior work for rival crypto exchange FTX before its bankruptcy led the DOJ to appoint FRA instead.On Feb 17, Cointelegraph reported that FTX creditors alleged that Sullivan & Cromwell, actively participated in the “FTX Group’s multibillion dollar fraud.”“S&C knew of FTX US and FTX Trading Ltd.’s omissions, untruthful and fraudulent conduct, and misappropriation of Class Members’ funds,” the creditors stated in a court filing as part of the class-action lawsuit.


However, there's reportedly an expectation that Sullivan & Cromwell will be selected for a separate five-year monitoring role for Binance, representing the Treasury Department's Financial Crimes Enforcement Network.Related: Binance obtains FIU approval for India returnThe reported appointment comes only weeks after Binance former CEO Changpeng "CZ" Zhao was sentenced to prison.On April 30, Zhao was sentenced to four months in prison for failing to maintain an effective Anti-Money Laundering program at the crypto exchange.Although prosecutors initially sought a three-year prison term, Judge Jones decided on a shorter sentence, claiming that there was no evidence Zhao was directly informed of specific illegal activities at Binance.Magazine: Binance hits back at WSJ, Hong Kong crypto ETF’s take ‘$50B equivalent’: Asia Express

Introduction to the crypto exchange Bybit: here's what you need to know

Bybit is a cryptocurrency exchange founded in 2018 that has quickly established itself as one of the leading players in the crypto derivatives market. 
Specialized in futures contracts with financial leverage, Bybit combines advanced technology, an intuitive user interface, and a strong commitment to security to attract both experienced traders and beginners.

The history of the crypto exchange Bybit
Bybit is a cryptocurrency exchange founded in March 2018 by Ben Zhou. The platform was designed with the goal of providing a safe, transparent, and efficient trading environment, particularly focused on cryptocurrency derivatives such as futures contracts.
Before founding Bybit, Ben Zhou had gained extensive experience in the financial sector as an executive at XM, one of the most well-known forex brokers in the world. 
This background has helped shape a solid foundation for Bybit, which since its inception has aimed to stand out in the increasingly crowded market of cryptocurrencies exchanges.
Bybit was launched at a time when the cryptocurrency market was still trying to recover after the boom and subsequent crash of 2017. 
Despite this challenging context, Bybit has quickly gained popularity and trust thanks to its user-friendly platform, transaction speed, and innovative approach to system security and stability. 
These factors have made Bybit particularly attractive to crypto derivatives traders, who require platforms capable of handling high volumes of transactions quickly and reliably.
One of the distinctive aspects of Bybit compared to other cryptocurrency exchanges is its focus on derivative products such as perpetual contracts, which do not have an expiration date and allow traders to speculate on the future price of cryptocurrencies with significant financial leverage. 
This feature has attracted a large number of experienced traders, who can take advantage of the volatility of the cryptocurrency market to potentially achieve high returns. 
Bybit is based in Singapore, a financial hub that has adopted a relatively open and regulated approach to the cryptocurrency sector, further contributing to the growth and success of the exchange in the global context.
How Bybit works
Derivatives Trading
Bybit mainly focuses on trading perpetual futures contracts, which are similar to traditional futures contracts but without an expiration date. This allows traders to hold a position indefinitely. The platform offers leverage of up to 100x, allowing traders to amplify their potential profits.

The Bybit interface is designed to be intuitive and easy to use, with detailed charts and technical analysis tools provided by TradingView. Users can customize the dashboard layout to suit their preferences, enhancing the trading experience. Additionally, Bybit offers a mobile app that allows trading on the go with the same ease as the desktop platform.

Disadvantages of Bybit
Complexity for Beginners: Despite an intuitive interface, trading derivatives with high leverage can be complex and risky for newcomers.
Regulation and Accessibility: Due to strict financial regulations, Bybit is not available in some countries, including the United States, which limits access for a significant portion of potential users.
Liquidation Risk: The use of high financial leverage can lead to rapid margin calls or liquidations, especially in a volatile market like cryptocurrencies.
Concentration on Derivatives: Bybit mainly focuses on derivative products, which can be a disadvantage for those who prefer spot trading or other forms of crypto investments.
Conclusions
In conclusion, Bybit has established itself as one of the leading cryptocurrency exchanges in the derivatives trading sector, standing out for its reliability, innovation, and customer orientation.

TON: What is The Open Network's crypto?

In the last few months there is a crypto that has entered the top 10 of those with the highest capitalization: TON by The Open Network.
TON has a very curious story behind it, and above all it is a very interesting crypto project.

The story of TON: the crypto of The Open Network
It all started in 2018, when Telegram launched its own ICO (Initial Coin Offer).
Telegram has long been the second largest messaging app in the world after WhatsApp, and has been looking for its own business model for some time. 
In 2018, he decided to start his own crypto project, based on the GRAM token. 
However, that ICO had many issues, especially with the US authorities, so much so that two years later Telegram was fined by the SEC for 18.5 million dollars.
The accusation was that of offering the public an unregistered security.
Telegram was then forced to close its crypto project, but since in those two years they had already made giant strides from a technical point of view, they decided not to abandon it completely. 
In addition to the GRAM token, which never landed on the markets, they had developed the TON blockchain, an acronym that at the time stood for Telegram Open Network.
Toncoin ($TON)
In reality, Telegram did not completely abandon the TON project, but transformed it into a decentralized project, renamed the blockchain The Open Network (keeping the acronym TON), and created the cryptocurrency Toncoin. 
And so in 2020 The Open Network project and the Toncoin cryptocurrency were born, which landed on the crypto markets the following year. 
The GRAM token no longer exists, but the Telegram Open Network has transformed into today’s TON.
Toncoin, which has the ticker TON, is the native cryptocurrency of The Open Network, and over time has shown very interesting market performance. 
Currently it is in eighth place overall for market capitalization, ahead of Dogecoin, Cardano, Shiba Inu, Avalanche, Tron, Polkadot, and others. However, if stablecoins are excluded, it would be in sixth place, with 24 billion dollars which is not far from XRP. For now, Solana and BNB are still significantly distant. 
TON: The blockchain crypto trend of The Open Network
Initially, in August 2021, the price was below 0.8$, but since the last major speculative bubble was underway, in November it exceeded 4.5$, with an immediate gain of 460% in less than three months. 
During the bear-market of 2022, however, the price dropped, ending up returning to those $0.8 from which it had started. 
At that point, one could have also believed that that performance was just a bubble, so much so that a year later the price was still only slightly above $1. 
However, things started to change between September and October 2023, just before the last bull run began. 
The fact is that since Telegram officially abandoned the Telegram Open Network project, it was not clear if it had a role in the new project The Open Network, even though the latter seemed to actually continue the previous one, as revealed by the acronym kept identical. 
As soon as Telegram made it clear that it also supported the new TON project, things changed. 
The performance of the last months
 In September of last year, the price had already risen to $2.4, but had closed the year at $2.2, still far from the $4.5 of November 2021. 
Everything changed when in recent months Telegram announced not only the integration of TON into its official wallet, but also a real marketing campaign in favor of this cryptocurrency. 
It should not be forgotten that Telegram has 900 million active users worldwide every month, more than the total number of cryptocurrency investors. 
Starting from the end of February, a new bullrun of TON has begun, bringing the price first to 4.3$, then surpassing 4.5$ establishing a new all-time high, and then reaching 7.6$ in April. 
Since then, it has only lost 9%, also because after returning to $4.6 at the beginning of May, in the last seven days it has recorded a significant +33%.
In other words, it doesn’t seem like the one in 2024 was a bubble similar to the one at the end of 2021, although a new return to $4.5 is always possible. 
However, a lot will also depend on the general trend of the crypto markets, because in case of a new bull run it is easy to imagine that TON will follow the other cryptos, but in case of a new retracement TON will hardly remain unaffected. 
What is TON
Technically, The Open Network is a crypto platform based on its own blockchain. 
The technological peculiarity of this decentralized blockchain is the ability to approve a very high number of transactions per second, with very low fees. 
On TONscan.org it can be read that the TON blockchain already hosts more than half a billion transactions, despite being launched only four years ago. For example, the Bitcoin blockchain was launched fifteen years ago and hosts about one billion transactions.
The average cost of a single transaction is around 0.005 TON, which is 3.5 cents in dollars. 
Although there are other chains that are able to allow transactions at even lower costs, 0.035$ is close to Solana’s 0.020$ and less than Ethereum’s 0.750$. Ethereum.
What TON aims for is to ensure extreme speed in transactions without congesting the network. 
However, its real strength lies in having Telegram behind it, and since TON is able to support many low-cost transactions, Telegram’s support could really prove to be very effective in the long run. 
Moreover, with the powerful promotional campaign launched by Telegram last month, it is possible that many people will become aware of TON and may also want to start using this network, especially now that it also supports USDT.
Finally, the Launchpool of Binance could also play a role, which announced the listing of Notcoin (NOT). NOT is a token on TON, although for now Binance has not yet listed TON.

The hunt against sybils: LayerZero completes the first snapshot of its crypto airdrop and invites the community to come together for on-chain malicious activities

The famous LayerZero interoperability project is about to change the landscape of crypto airdrops once and for all, after the latest message launched to the community.
The first of the snapshots to determine which users will have the opportunity to claim the ZRO token has already been carried out by the project team, but some individuals may lose eligibility if classified as sybil.
In this first phase LayerZero, in an attempt to decentralize its network as much as possible and release a fair token distribution, invited members of its community to come forward in case they had maliciously managed sybil wallet clusters.
For those who self-report, the project offers 15% of the total airdrop allocation.
Risk everything or settle for less? 
Let’s see everything in detail below.

LayerZero crypto airdrop: first official snapshot completed
On May 2nd, LayerZero publishes on its profile X one of the most anticipated announcements by the crypto airdrop farming community: the first snapshot, which will determine which users will be eligible for the launch of the governance token ZRO, was taken on May 1st, 2024 at 11:59:59 PM UTC.

In this first phase, almost 6 million different cryptographic addresses have been revealed that have interacted at least once with one of the various interoperability protocols that leverage LayerZero technology since its launch in March 2022.
Altogether over 50 different chains have been reached, including L1, L2, and various “exotic” networks reaching billion-dollar volumes.
According to the data reported by Dune Analytics, cross-chain bridge activities on LayerZero have significantly intensified since March 2024, reaching a peak of approximately 250,000 daily transactions. 
Overall, more than 6 million transactions have been made thanks to the omnichain communication protocol, although the data could be significantly larger because this dashboard only takes into account the most well-known chains.

In the coming days, more information will be published regarding the date when it will be possible to check the airdrop and make the claim of rewards in the form of the ZRO crypto.
Now for LayerZero the main challenge is to define criteria that could potentially exclude a good portion of sybil users who have farmed with hundreds of wallets and at the same time offer a fair token distribution within the community.
We still don’t know when the airdrop will actually be launched, but it could really be very soon.
Many brokers are including ZRO in their pre-market exchanges, suggesting that an official listing is just around the corner.
Meanwhile you can consult this “wallet checker“, and check the metrics related to your address with data on transactions made, days of activity, exchange volumes, networks used, and much more.
It’s a hunt against the sybils: LayerZero agrees on a minimum allocation of the airdrop for those who register
Immediately after announcing the first snapshot for the ZRO crypto airdrop, LayerZero has published more information regarding the means by which their team intends to exclude the sybil users.
We remind you that sybils represent individuals (or groups) who, in order to obtain the largest share of an airdrop, use an ecosystem in an unethical manner by carrying out operations with dozens if not hundreds of different wallets.
Given the large participation of Sybil in the LayerZero airdrop, the project team has decided to undertake a modus operandi that is still completely unexplored in the crypto world.
For the first time in history, this category is formally invited to organize itself (by filling out a specific form) indicating the addresses with which farming was carried out, with an incentive of 15%  compared to the original airdrop quota.
At this point, Sybil only have two options:
delivering to LayerZero and receiving a 15% reward compared to what they would have earned from legitimate users
do not surrender and hope that the subsequent on-chain cluster analyses carried out by LayerZero do not identify the addresses in question. If they are identified, they will not receive any reward.

The farmers community was shocked by the announcement: many users asked for explanations to Bryan Pellegrino, CEO of the project, wondering how an ordinary user can know if their activities fall below the sybil threshold or not.
With an emblematic tweet, Pellegrino partially silenced the complaints of users (probably the sybils themselves), publicly declaring that:
“if you think you are a sybil, you are probably a sybil”
On a more technical level, we can define sybil as all those addresses that are closely connected (funded by the same wallet, with a similar activity) to dozens, hundreds, or thousands of other accounts.
Also included in this category are all those who have exchanged trivial amounts like 0.01 dollars and have made “bridge ofNFTwithout value” on sybil farming applications like Merkly, L2Pass, L2Marathon etc.

At this point, however, many have complained that Merkly represents the second most used dapp under LayerZero technology, and it seems unfair to exclude all those who have interacted with the application.
Actually, as communicated by the LayerZero team itself, using Merkly does not automatically mark the address as sybil as long as other protocols have also been used.
Instead of using only and exclusively the dapp in question, it will most likely label you as incorrect users, and therefore you will be excluded from the airdrop.

Snitch Hunting: LayerZero’s next strategic move
As communicated in the anti-sybil report, once the incentive campaign for all those who join the LayerZero team is completed, there will be an intermediate phase in which the project team will release its list of users who will be excluded from the airdrop.
Starting from May 18th, the sybil report will be conducted in collaboration with on-chain analysis experts Nansen and Chaos Labs.
The study will consider the quality of transactions made by each address in the community with specific evaluation criteria, aiming to detect suspicious activities and exclude wallet clusters that appear to be linked to the same person or funded by the same entity.

At the end of the report publication, there will be the final phase of identifying the sybils, also heavily criticized by some representatives of the crypto world.
Basically the entire community will be invited to “be the spy” and report to LayerZero a list of individuals attributable to sybil through a bounty program.
The addresses provided by the user (after confirmation by the team) will be removed from the list of eligible users, and the spies will receive a 10% share of the sybil airdrop.
Some have ironically described this practice as “Snitch Hunting“, indicating how it could create bad blood within the community.
By doing so, there is a risk of generating tensions and widespread discontent, especially considering that many will go as far as to report anyone in front of them in order to receive a larger allocation from the airdrop.
Anyway, it is still early to evaluate whether this move by the LayerZero team will bear fruit and manage to exclude a wide range of dishonest users from the airdrop.

Donald Bitcoin (DONBTC) to Rally 11,000% Ahead of MEXC Listing, as Shiba Inu, Bonk and Dogecoin Lag



                    

Early investors in memecoins like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Bonk (BONK) and Dogecoin (DOGE) made astronomical returns, and Donald Bitcoin (DONBTC) presents a similar opportunity for a limited time.



Donald Bitcoin (DONBTC), a newly launched Solana memecoin, is poised to explode over 11,000% in a matter of days, as former Shiba Inu (SHIB), Bonk (BONK) and Dogecoin (DOGE) investors pour funds into this new token.




DONBTC will be listed on MEXC, one of the largest centralized exchanges in the world, within a few days – and this is a massively bullish development for the token, as millions of new investors will easily be able to buy Donald Bitcoin.



Currently, Donald Bitcoin can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jupiter and Raydium, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days.



To buy DONBTC on these platforms, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Donald Bitcoin by entering its contract address – 7nErZV74Y8L7zz1thKUczBniWMnLc74gQMdzbWnhr95e – in the receiving field.




DONBTC currently has a market cap of just under $15,000, meaning it has huge upside potential.



Early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and Bonk (BONK) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price.



If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner.

Feds Governor Foresees Continued Pause With Interest Rate Cuts in 2024


							

Michelle Bowman doesn’t expect the Fed to cut interest rates in 2024.



Bowman thinks the Fed cutting interest rates in 2024 will be “inappropriate.”



The Governor urged the Fed to proceed “carefully and deliberately” with its 2% inflation goal.




According to reports, Federal Reserve Governor Michelle Bowman said she doesn’t expect the Fed to cut interest rates in 2024. Bowman cited persistent inflation in the first several months of the year as the main reason she does not see cutting interest rates as an appropriate move by America’s apex bank.



Bowman’s comments came during an interview after her speech to bankers at a recent event in Texas, where she urged the central bank to proceed “carefully and deliberately” as policymakers move toward the Fed’s 2% inflation goal.



Meanwhile, Atlanta Fed President Raphael Bostic believes the Fed could still cut rates before the end of 2024. Despite his belief, he remained uncertain when and by how much the Fed would implement the policy easing. Bostic was also unsure about how inflation would decline in the future.



Bostic highlighted that most firms think that pricing power is at or near its limit and that wage growth is returning to its pre-pandemic levels. He also thinks optimistic disinflation will continue, even though the Fed may not achieve its target of 2% inflation until next year or early 2026.









Furthermore, Bostic focused on getting the timing right with easing rather than the extent of potential rate cuts this year. The banking chief further noted that job growth needs to slow to be consistent with the Fed’s 2% inflation goal, even though it may not lead to unemployment spikes. 



Amid the banking chiefs’ outlook, signals from the FOMC suggest an impending delay in the easing of monetary policy due to disappointing first-quarter inflation data. According to Fed Chairman Jerome Powell, the policymaker does not expect it would be appropriate to reduce the target range for the federal funds rate until it has gained greater confidence that inflation is moving sustainably toward 2%.

How can crypto companies leverage AI to create strategies?

How can crypto (and non-crypto) companies leverage Artificial Intelligence (AI) to create the best strategies? The Forbes Business Council has published 20 ideas, including the one from Gracy Chen, Managing Director of Bitget. Here are the details.

Crypto companies and AI to create sustainable and effective content strategies
In a discussion of the Forbes Business Council on how to leverage Artificial Intelligence (AI) to build sustainable content strategies, the idea of Gracy Chen from Bitget also emerged. 
And in fact, the Managing Director of the crypto-exchange stated that the integration of AI can simplify operations, accelerate processes, and free up more space for employee creativity. 
Basically, Chen’s idea is to leverage AI to simplify and automate operations, focusing on the heavier analytical work, so that the team can concentrate on innovation. 
Among the other 20 ideas emerged from the Forbes Business Council, the use of AI can be used by crypto (and non-crypto) companies “to create drafts to submit to team members for correction” or “to analyze data to obtain more personalized content”.
Others like Armand Peri from New Age have talked about AI “to identify audience behaviors and trends,” while James Mull from the Mull Group sees Artificial Intelligence as useful “to discover new opportunities.”
Gracy Chen from Bitget and the Forbes Business Council
It was October 2023, when the managing director of Bitget’s crypto-exchange, Gracy Chen, was appointed member of the Forbes Business Council.
This makes Chen part of the established leaders who gather on the platform to discuss and share best practices. 
Members of the Forbes Business Council are hand-selected and participate in discussions on contemporary issues concerning various industries and the global economic landscape.
Not by chance, the current topic of the forum has been dedicated to the innovation of AI and how to exploit it in the field of creating sustainable content.
Anyway, Chen’s appointment to this Council recognizes her as a leader and underscores her commitment and that of Bitget in shaping the future of cryptocurrencies. 
The price of AI and Big Data crypto
Looking at the prices of AI and Big Data category tokens, it seems that in the last week there is a positive trend.
And indeed, for the first three of this ranking, it seems that the price is definitely in bullish. 
On Friday, May 10th, the price of Near Protocol (NEAR) is up by +21% compared to seven days ago and is worth 7.49$. Following that, there is Render (RNDR), up by +45%, with the current price of 11.16$ and The Graph (GRT) up by +22%, with the current price of 0.30$.
Even in terms of market capitalization, these 3 AI and Big Data cryptos seem to climb the overall crypto ranking. 
NEAR is also in 17th place with over 8 billion dollars in market cap, RNDR is in 24th place with over 4.3 billion dollars in market cap, and finally, GRT is in 40th place with 2.9 billion dollars in market cap.

Santiment Names Two Newly Trending Altcoins: One Is Considered Similar to XRP - Bitcoin Sistemi


Cryptocurrency analysis company Santiment found in its statement that two altcoins exhibited remarkable behavior.
According to analysts, Velo (VELO) has recently begun to attract attention among cryptocurrency traders and has begun to be called the “XRP of Southeast Asia”.


Analysts added that the VELO price has increased by 358% in the last 6 weeks. Santiment said that the UMA altcoin has also seen a huge uptick in user interest, rising more than 50% in the last 36 hours.

However, it is worth remembering that some of the high interest in VELO is due to negative sensitivity. However, when the data is examined, it is observed that positive sensitivity is higher than negative sensitivity. On the UMA side, although there was negative sensitivity, it was observed that the positive sensitivity was higher.

U.S. Regulators Increase Scrutiny on Crypto Firms Amid Rising Market Manipulation Concerns



                    

The crypto industry has experienced significant growth due to the influx of new investors, enhancing adoption but also increasing scrutiny from regulators. 



The industry now faces increased attention from regulatory bodies concerned with market manipulation, investor protection, and potential illicit uses of cryptocurrency.




The United States Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) has indicated a rise in enforcement actions within the next six months to two years. 



During the 27th Annual Milken Institute Global Conference on May 6, CFTC Chair Rostin Behnam highlighted concerns about potential crypto-centered scams and frauds due to the surge in cryptocurrency prices and the participation of inexperienced retail investors. 



Behnam expressed, “We’re going to probably see in the next 6 to 18 months, or 6 to 24 months, another cycle of enforcement actions because of this cycle of asset appreciation and interest by retail investors.”




In 2023, both the CFTC and the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) increased their enforcement actions, with the SEC tripling its number of administrative proceedings and initiating 46 enforcement actions, imposing $281 million in fines for settlements. 



These enforcement actions have targeted a range of crypto firms, with notable actions against large platforms like Kraken, Binance, and Coinbase.



The SEC has focused particularly on firms with broker-dealer business models. Patrick Gruhn, a former partner at Crypto Lawyers, emphasized the SEC’s strategy, stating, “The SEC targets business models and firms that, from a high-level perspective, compete with traditional finance, e.g., broker-dealers.

If a project or company allows people to speculate on the price of crypto assets or generate interest-like payments, such a firm or project team is at risk, whether it considers itself decentralized or not.”



There is also a significant focus on privacy and mixer tools, with actions against services like Tornado Cash and the privacy-focused Samurai wallet. 



This has sparked a mix of reactions in the crypto community, with many opposing the targeting of service creators who believe they are engaging in legal activities.



The lack of a unified regulatory framework in the U.S. has led to a complex environment for crypto firms, influencing how new and existing companies navigate the market. 



As noted by Keith Blackman of the Bracewell law firm, the absence of clear regulations increases the need for companies to invest heavily in legal and compliance services, potentially stifling innovation and deterring new market entrants.



Despite regulatory challenges, the crypto market continues to attract interest from traditional finance, with new investment products like spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds and the growing political influence of crypto holders.

Bitcoin Rebounds to $63,000 Amidst Surging Liquidity Over $100 Million



                    

Bitcoin saw a rebound to $63,000 on May 10, amidst a notable increase in overhead liquidity, which exceeded $100 million. 



Data from Cointelegraph Markets Pro and TradingView indicated a spike in BTC/USD to local highs of $63,876 on Bitstamp, followed by a period of consolidation.




This price action marked an improvement following lows below $61,000, a decline that continued despite positive unemployment data from the United States suggesting economic resilience. 



Material Indicators, a trading resource, highlighted a substantial increase in ask liquidity just above the spot price. 



Specifically, liquidity was reported to be over $100 million between the $63,000 and $65,000 range on the same day, according to their FireCharts tool.




Material Indicators’ co-founder, Keith Alan, provided further insights into the market’s dynamics. 



He noted, “Historically, the side with the highest concentration of liquidity wins these intra-trend battles,” indicating a potential for continued upward momentum if these liquidity levels maintained.



Alan also detailed potential support levels that could come into play if Bitcoin were to decline again. 



He pointed to the historical consolidation range of $58,000 to $60,000 as initial targets.

“Order book data in FireCharts shows that there isn’t currently a lot of bid liquidity at $60k, but there is more at $58k. If price holds there, it would create a higher low which is what bulls want to see,” he explained.



The significance of the 21-week simple moving average (SMA), currently at $56,127, was also underscored by Alan. 



He highlighted the $52,000 level as a critical point if the SMA support failed, which could signify a 30% correction from the all-time high. 



Observations indicated that much of the bid liquidity that had been forming support had moved up to $58,000, suggesting a possible shift in market sentiment.



In terms of market sentiment and its influence on Bitcoin’s price movements, Alan concluded, “Of course, nothing changes sentiment like price movement so, if bears manage to push price below $58k we will either see sentiment strengthen in the $50k – $52k range or start shifting towards the mid $40s.”



Meanwhile, Rekt Capital, a popular trader and analyst, commented on the lack of major upheaval in the market despite the previous week’s downside wick. 



He stated, “Bitcoin is still simply holding the Range Low as support,” referring to the stabilization following the block subsidy halving in April, which he previously suggested hadn’t fundamentally altered market behavior.

The SEC Files To Stop Coinbase’s Attempt to Ask a Howey Test Question


							

The SEC has moved to stop Coinbase’s appeal to the court in the ongoing litigation.



Coinbase applied for permission to ask the Second Circuit Court of Appeals if the Howey Test should apply to digital assets.



Coinbase accused the SEC of creating a “new legal test” that would fit cryptocurrencies into existing securities.




The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has moved to stop Coinbase’s appeal to the court in the ongoing litigation. The crypto exchange reportedly applied for permission to ask the Second Circuit Court of Appeals if the Howey Test should apply to digital assets.



To stop Coinbase’s appeal, the SEC filed on Friday that the crypto exchange has not successfully argued that the appeal is needed. However, the Howey Test question stems from the SEC’s accusation that Coinbase operates as an unregistered broker, exchange, and clearinghouse in the U.S.



Meanwhile, the SEC’s stand revolves around some cryptocurrencies being securities. Under such conditions, the affected cryptos would meet the Howey Test, requiring Coinbase to get the SEC’s approval before making them available for customers to trade.



According to the filing by Coinbase, the SEC is attempting to create a “new legal test” that would fit cryptocurrencies into existing securities precedent already resisted by a district judge. However, the SEC argued that the crypto exchange “remains unable to advance a single coherent version of this theory, which it now claims presents a controlling question.” The SEC highlighted that Coinbase has not proved that there was a “controlling question” in its original filing.









Furthermore, the SEC noted a disjointed argument in Coinbase’s filing, citing the crypto exchange’s claim of focusing on a specific legal question about “contractual obligations.” According to the SEC, Coinbase’s argument about the application of Howey to crypto is an entirely different question altogether.



Despite the SEC countermotion to Coinbase’s request to appeal, the final decision lies with Judge Katherine Polk Failla, who is overseeing the case between both parties. If Failla sides with Coinbase, the crypto exchange will proceed to send the motion to the appeals court.

Can Pepe Surge 51% Following Crypto Whales' Accumulation?


Major crypto whales have capitalized on the current market downturn. They have acquired substantial amounts of the meme coin Pepe (PEPE), with transactions totaling approximately $5.56 million. 
This activity coincides with a general decline in the crypto market.
Is Pepe Poised to Surge 51%?
Spot On Chain, an on-chain analysis platform, detailed that a prominent crypto whale, identified by the wallet address 0xa14, has been particularly active. 
This investor withdrew 350.2 billion PEPE, valued at $2.93 million, from the crypto exchange Binance. This transaction marks the investor’s fourth in an ongoing series, bringing their total estimated profit from this trade to $1.63 million, a 15% increase.

Furthermore, since March 14, 2024, this whale has withdrawn 1.449 trillion PEPE from Binance at an average price of $0.000007496, with total spending estimated at $10.86 million. Subsequently, deposits back into Binance amounted to 789.26 billion PEPE, acquired at an average price of $0.000008542, totaling $6.74 million. Currently, the investor holds 660 billion PEPE, valued at approximately $5.74 million.

“Previously, the whale had earned an estimated cumulative profit of $955,000 (+33.6%) from all 3 previous PEPE trading cycles. He has a win rate of 100%,” Spot On Chain mentioned. 

Other significant traders have also been accumulating PEPE. According to Lookonchain, another investor, identified as 0xa4F, purchased 123.66 billion PEPE at $0.00000881, amounting to $1.09 million in USDC. 

Similarly, wallet address 0x895 withdrew 101 billion PEPE, worth about $885,000, from Binance. Meanwhile, 0x24E3 invested $661,000 USDC to buy 74.5 billion PEPE at a rate of $0.000008873.
These acquisitions occurred as Bitcoin experienced a notable dip, dropping nearly 5% from $63,400 to $60,180 last Friday. Despite the broader market’s struggles, PEPE has shown resilience and a quick recovery, currently up nearly 7% from Friday’s low.
Additionally, PEPE’s recovery was supported on May 3 when it broke out from an inverse head and shoulders chart pattern, a bullish chart pattern. On May 8, the meme coin retested the neckline of this pattern at $0.00000785 and experienced an 11% bounce.

Market analysis suggests that based on the current chart pattern, PEPE could potentially surge up to $0.00001330, representing a 51% increase from its current market price.

However, investors should closely monitor significant resistance at $0.00000890. A daily closing below $0.00000785 would invalidate this bullish trend, potentially signaling declines.

Bitcoin Rise Inevitable, Analyst Pinpoints $150,000 Price Target
In a series of X posts on Friday, Titan of Crypto shared some interesting bullish predictions on the Bitcoin market. Firstly, the analyst noted that amidst BTC’s price decline, the token’s price pattern on the daily timeframe had formed a bullish signal.
Titan of Crypto referred to this signal as the bullish engulfing candle which occurs when a larger bullish candle completely emerges from the previous smaller bearish candle, thus indicating a potential reversal from a downtrend to an uptrend.
Following these observations, the analyst also predicted Bitcoin to soon experience a massive post-halving price gain. Titan of Crypto described this forecast as “inevitable” citing data from Bitcoin’s price history.
The crypto analyst said: 
To understand the present you have to search in the past. And what the past is telling us is there is no occurrence of #BTC  not having a rally after the halving.
Titan of Crypto also acknowledged that short-term price movements may be “confusing” however he expects BTC to maintain an upward trajectory in the long room. Based on previous post-halving rallies, Titan of Crypto predicts Bitcoin to trade at $150,000 in 2025.

BTC Close To Bottom Price As Dip Buy Interest Drops
In other news, blockchain analytics website Santiment also predicts the recent downturn in Bitcoin’s price could soon end stating the token is near a “bottom” i.e. the lowest point in a market fall at which price stops falling and starts rising exponentially.
Interestingly, this prediction by Santiment is based on a decline in the dip-buying activity of Bitcoin investors. The analytics platform reports that the trading interest in Bitcoin following its most recent decline on Friday is far below levels associated with previous price falls.
At the time of writing, Bitcoin continues to trade around $60,968, with an overall price loss of 3.26% in the last week. On the monthly chart, the digital coin also remains in the red zone, reflecting a decline of $13.64%. However, Bitcoin’s daily trading volume remains positive by 9.73% and $27.88 billion.

During the recent episode of Chris Vasquez’s Worldclass podcast, Ripple boss Brad Garlinghouse revealed the biggest achievement of the company gained in the course of opposing the Security and Exchange Commission of the US in court.He also touched on other issues and shared the key secret to hiring A+ talents for Ripple. Ripple's big high during SEC suitBrad Garlinghouse, who joined Ripple on the position of the chief executive officer after working as a CEO in several large Web2 companies and after being a top executive in Yahoo, took part in the recent episode of the Worldcall podcast. Before accepting an offer from Chris Larsen to take over as a Ripple CEO in 2015, Garlinghouse turned down a job offer from Uber, since he thought that working for Uber would not bring any radical changes into his life.One of the key things he shared with the host Chris Vasquez was the biggest high achieved by Ripple during the lawsuit of the SEC against Ripple Labs that has been running for the past four years.Garlinghouse shared that when Ripple got sued, dark times started for the company. However, with the victory scored last year, when the federal judge Analisa Torres ruled that XRP sales on secondary markets do not qualify as security sales, Ripple CEO said that they “won all the things we cared about, and not just for Ripple but for the industry, that was a big high.”The US government is after Tether, Garlinghouse says Garlinghouse also revealed that he loves to get the best talents to join Ripple. A+ talents, he said want to leave a dent in the universe that money is not enough to motivate them here. Therefore, his secret here is to hire failed entrepreneurs for these high level positions.During this conversation, Garlinghouse also expressed a view that the US government is going after Tether. He strongly believes in that, adding that he sees Tether and its USDT stablecoin as a very important part of the ecosystem.

FIT21 Is A U.S. Regulatory Framework For Digital Assets


                                FIT21, a New Era in the U.S. Regulatory Framework for Digital Assets                                What’s the NewsThe Financial Innovation and Technology for the 21st Century Act or FIT21 has unfolded in the committee after which it may be subjected to a full plenary vote in the House of Representatives in the United States.  Through July 2023 act passed, U. S. officials give authority to the United States Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) and Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and supervise the impact of digital currencies in the country.On May 10, House Financial Services Committee Chair Patrick McHenry revealed that the FIT21 bill could go for a vote of the full chamber around May mid-November, presupposing that the Rules Committee won't veto the plan at this stage. As Representative French Hill pointed out, a well-controlled regulatory environment is of deep importance to ensure investors' safety while fostering the non-failure growth of blockchain technology.According to the Republican lawmakers, the FIT21 should be a role delineation of SEC's regulator function for the cryptocurrencies and the CFTC indeed could have more influence over the commodities with digital features. The House passed a resolution to modify the SEC accounting rule that was perceived harmful to banks by a bipartisan vote that followed this proclamation. However, the matter is uncertain until today concerning FIT21 passing the vote successfully. Even though Representative McHenry lauded both parties for their effort in moving the proposal toward completion, legislation is yet to be passed, and the president’s signature, and approval of the Senate, are still required before the act can be finalized.Sheila Warren, the CEO of the Crypto Council for Innovation remarked, that FIT21 represents a leap forward towards the formation of a federal digital assets regulatory framework in the United States. The stakeholders will now have an opportunity to study the latest wording of the bill that was changed since their first markups in July.Impact of FIT21The arrival of rules for digital assets called FIT21 by the United States has been agreed to be a significant step in developing a comprehensive framework. The bill's contents deal with the concerns that were raised by events of a somewhat recent nature like the collapse of FTX and provide a way to put in place protections for consumers more than that, there is much-needed clarification of the regulatory institutions. It should be noted that FIT21 seeks to strengthen regulatory agencies such as the SEC and CFTC with all-embracing oversight and management functions of the digital asset markets to regain investor trust and option blockchain innovation. However, the bill still needs more votes in the Senate and the House for it to become law which will complicate its approval.ConclusionCoin Gabbar reflects, that by campaigning on digital asset regulation and supervision, legislators are expressing their increased attention to this issue as the United States argument positions itself for the election season. One example of the initiative is Coinbase's Stand With Cryptocurrency PAC which is aimed at raising the level of awareness of cryptocurrencies among politicians. Hence, the actors think that the introduction of FIT21 would be a significant milestone toward developing such regulation and determining the US crypto market fate.Also Read:  What’s Cooking In South Korea’s “Bitcoin Meal Boxes”?

This Chainlink Competitor Could Explode by up to 230% From Current Level, Says Arthur Hayes-Linked Crypto Fund - The Daily Hodl


								Maelstrom Fund, an early-stage crypto investment fund operated by Arthur Hayes’ family office, is expressing bullish sentiment on a relatively new blockchain oracle digital asset.
The early-stage fund says that Chainlink (LINK) rival Flare (FLR) is “likely undervalued” currently.










“Chainlink’s early mover advantage has given it a sizable head start, with countless projects having already integrated with its services. However, as Flare gains traction, it has the potential to quickly catch up to Chainlink.”
“To better illustrate Flare’s potential,” Maelstrom Fund says that the fully diluted valuation of FLR is currently about 23% of Chainlink’s even though the upstart has less than 10% of the project integrations that the Ethereum (ETH)-based Chainlink already boasts.
The Arthur Hayes-linked fund says that, unlike other oracle providers including the Solana (SOL)-based Pyth Network (PYTH), Flare “can also build its own native ecosystem.”
According to Maelstrom Fund, if Flare reaches 50% of Chainlink’s fully diluted valuation, the FLR token could go up by approximately 2.2x. If Flare reaches 75% of Chainlink’s fully diluted valuation, FLR could soar by 3.3x, says the Arthur Hayes-linked crypto fund.
“While Chainlink is clearly the market leader, its latency and applicability to high-throughput use cases leaves much to be desired. Pyth’s focus on financial institutions, on the other hand, brings a unique dimension to the oracle space, but leaves much on the table in terms of general applicability across use cases. Flare’s approach of combining the above with features of an L1 (layer-1) gives it a unique positioning worth watching.”

                        Ethereum restaking protocol EigenLayer has initiated its token-claim process, commonly referred to as an “airdrop,” for Season 1, Phase 1 rewards.According to a recent blog post by the protocol’s development team, users who are eligible for the new EIGEN token can now acquire it through the claims process after a few weeks of anticipation.However, it’s important to note that EIGEN tokens are currently nontransferable, meaning users cannot sell or trade them.EIGEN Token to Become Transferable in Future
The blog post further mentioned that the EIGEN token will become transferable once the development team implements new features in the upcoming months.The tentative target date for these implementations is set for September 30.It’s crucial for users to claim their tokens before the claim process closes on September 7, as any unclaimed tokens after that date will not be distributed.According to EigenLayer’s documentation, the EIGEN token is not available for users in over 30 jurisdictions, including the United States, Russia, China, and Canada.Additionally, most VPN server addresses are prohibited from being used for token claims.The current claims process has unlocked 6.05% of the total supply of EIGEN tokens, and an additional 0.7% will be unlocked in mid-June during “Phase 2.”At that time, users of applications such as Kelp, Pendle, Equilibrium, and similar apps will be eligible to claim their tokens.The ongoing airdrop primarily caters to users who restaked Ether or its liquid staking derivatives on EigenLayer before March 15.Users who hold liquid restaking tokens (LRTs) can also claim their rewards now, as long as their activities do not fall under “Phase 2.”Additionally, users who restaked on EigenLayer between March 15 and April 29 are eligible to claim 100 bonus tokens immediately, with the majority of their claims becoming available in mid-June alongside other Phase 2 participants.The EIGEN airdrop has sparked controversy within the decentralized finance (DeFi) community. Leandro Schlottchauer, co-founder of Kuyen Labs, stated that it might be one of the last “life-changing airdrops.”Conversely, many EigenLayer users have criticized the airdrop for its ban on VPN servers, the distribution of nontransferable tokens, and its perceived short snapshot period.LayerZero Labs to Exclude Sybil Farmers From Airdrop
As airdrop season rages on, LayerZero Labs, a renowned cross-chain interoperability protocol, has vowed to tackle the issue of sybil farmers ahead of its highly anticipated airdrop.The project has stated that it will conduct an internal investigation to identify and exclude sybil farmers from receiving allocations in its future token generation event.Additionally, the project plans to launch a reward program, offering a 10% bonus of the intended token allocation to bounty hunters who identify additional sybil users.LayerZero Labs recently completed the first snapshot for its highly anticipated airdrop.In December, the project announced its plans to distribute tokens to early adopters in the first half of 2024.

DogWifHat (WIF) — Hilarious Pup in a Pink Cap Gains Popularity and Emerges as One of the Leading Meme Coins in the Market
Launched in late 2023, Dogwifhat (WIF) is a meme coin on the Solana blockchain, featuring a Shiba Inu dog wearing a pink knitted cap. Avoiding the big visions and interesting websites typical of meme coins, WIF chooses its straightforward identity, billing itself as “literally just a dog wif a hat.”
Despite its simple concept and lack of innovative features, WIF has defied expectations. Starting at just 7 cents early in 2024, the token quickly picked up steam. By February’s end, it broke the $1 mark, and by the end of March, it peaked at $4.85—an astonishing 7,000% increase in under three months.
WIF’s market cap followed this path, hitting over $1 billion by mid-March and reaching a peak of $4.75 billion. This phenomenal growth turned what began as a playful meme into one of the crypto market’s major players by 2024.
Final Thoughts
The market has finally emerged from the red, with many popular altcoins gradually recovering their losses.
Now, with another bull run on the horizon, investors are seeking the next meme coin poised to skyrocket and deliver significant profits.
Many industry experts suggest that these five meme coins are prime candidates for investment in May 2024.
Given that most of these tokens are still in the presale phase, there remains an opportunity to secure them at reasonable prices before they explode.

The Crypto Industry Will Win The SEC in the Long Run - Ripple CEO


							

Brad Garlinghouse believes the crypto industry will win the fight against the SEC.



According to Garlinhouse, the best technologies always win in the long run.



The SEC is currently entangled in several disagreements with crypto establishments.




Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse believes the crypto industry will win the fight against the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). In a recently uploaded video, Garlinghouse noted that the best technologies always win in the long run.







According to the Ripple CEO, the SEC’s efforts to curtail crypto activities will fail in the long run. He noted that what the SEC is doing in its fight against crypto is nothing compared to the industry’s continued multi-decade growth.



Furthermore, Garlinghouse highlighted his optimism about the future of crypto, noting that all the current happenings will look pale with the industry’s development twenty years from now. He believes users will measure the crypto market in many trillions in the future, noting that it is an industry that will change how transactions work. According to the Ripple Chief, cryptocurrencies reduce friction and cost, making things more efficient.



The SEC’s fight against the crypto industry remains a significant occurrence surrounding the sector. The commission’s legal battle with Ripple represents one of many lawsuits and regulation attempts the SEC is pursuing.









Many users believe the commission’s legal battle with Ripple is nearing a conclusive end, following recent filings by both parties. However, Garlinghouse’s position is that no matter the outcome of current events, the crypto industry will naturally overcome the challenges and thrive above all obstacles.



Apart from Ripple, the SEC is entangled in other disagreements with crypto establishments, including top crypto exchanges like Binance, Coinbase, and Kraken. Earlier this week, Kraken filed a motion asking the court to dismiss the SEC’s case against it, citing inappropriate wording in the latter’s submission.

Bill for Cryptocurrency Regulation in Turkey to be Submitted to Parliament this Week - Here are the Details - Bitcoin Sistemi


With the regulation on crypto assets that it will submit to the Parliament this week, the AK Party aims to include the platforms where crypto assets are traded within the scope of the Capital Markets Board (CMB) regulation and supervision. With the work carried out under the chairmanship of AK Party Group Chairman Abdullah Güler, the preparations on the bill containing regulations regarding crypto assets were completed. The proposal is planned to be submitted to the Speaker of the Turkish Grand National Assembly within the week.
The new proposal aims to reduce the risks of parties transacting with crypto assets in Turkey, similar to international practices. The regulation, which will define crypto assets in a broad sense, aims to license the platforms on which they are traded by the CMB and to include them within the scope of CMB regulation and control.


The proposal will include the storage of cash and crypto assets held on behalf of customers on the platforms, the relations between platforms and customers, and the sanctions and penalties to be applied. The criteria regarding the operating principles of the platforms will be determined by the secondary regulation.

The bill will include provisions authorizing the CMB to authorize people who develop block-chain and similar technologies to sell or distribute crypto assets whose value cannot be separated from these technologies and to impose a permit requirement. The regulation aims to involve the Scientific and Technological Research Council of Turkey (TÜBİTAK) in this process, thus encouraging the development of software architecture and related technological tools for creating block-chain.





With the enactment of the regulation on crypto assets and the start of licensing of crypto asset service providers, it is envisaged that the criticisms brought within the scope of the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) technical standard No. 15 will be eliminated and Turkey will leave the “partially compliant” category.

What is cryptocurrency insurance, and how does it work?

                            Cryptocurrency insurance, explained                                        Cryptocurrency insurance acts as a safety net for various stakeholders in the digital asset market, including individuals, companies and institutional investors.The purpose of cryptocurrency insurance, also known as digital asset insurance or crypto coverage, is to reduce the risks involved in trading, storing or possessing cryptocurrencies and other digital assets. Individuals, companies and institutional investors are financially protected against losses brought on by a variety of incidents, such as theft, hacking, fraud, operational mistakes and legal actions, with cryptocurrency insurance.Traditional insurance solutions frequently fall short of providing adequate coverage given the particular risks connected with cryptocurrencies, such as scams and regulatory difficulties. By providing specialized solutions made especially for the ecosystem of digital assets, cryptocurrency insurance fills this gap.                                                                    How does cryptocurrency insurance work?                                        Cryptocurrency insurance mechanics involve evaluating the risk profile of the insured party, tailoring plans to their needs, underwriting to assess insurability and assisting in processing claims.An evaluation of the risk profile of the insured party is the first stage in cryptocurrency insurance mechanics. The value of retained digital assets, security measures put in place, trading activity and regulatory compliance are just a few of the factors that insurers consider. Insurers tailor plans based on this evaluation to the insured’s particular requirements and risk tolerance. After that, premiums are computed using multiple factors, including market conditions, past data on breaches, asset valuations, coverage limits and security measures.When establishing the terms and conditions of coverage and evaluating whether a risk is insurable, underwriting is essential. Crypto insurance underwriters conduct due diligence to assess the insurability of the risk and set terms and conditions for coverage. This involves analyzing the security infrastructure, operational protocols, regulatory compliance and financial stability of the insured party.When a covered loss or incident occurs, the insured notifies the insurer of the claim and provides supporting documents and evidence. The insurer assists the insured in overcoming the financial impact of the loss by paying the agreed-upon amount after verification.                                                                    Types of cryptocurrency insurance coverage                                        Cryptocurrency insurance offers various types of coverage tailored to address specific risks — e.g., theft, fraud, bankruptcy, etc. — faced by stakeholders in the digital asset ecosystem. Some common types of crypto insurance coverage include:Crypto theft insuranceCryptocurrency theft insurance offers protection against the loss of digital assets due to hacking, illegal access, phishing scams or other malevolent acts.Crypto custody insurance Crypto custody insurance offers protection against theft, bankruptcy and operational errors for assets kept in the care of third-party service providers, including exchanges, wallets and custodial platforms.Cybersecurity insurance for cryptocurrencyFinancial protection against losses arising from theft, hacking or cybersecurity breaches involving users’ digital assets is provided by cybersecurity insurance for cryptocurrencies. It can compensate for expenses associated with misplaced funds, investigations, efforts to retrieve them and any legal obligations. For people and companies with sizable cryptocurrency assets, this specialist insurance is crucial. Policies can differ, so it’s important to thoroughly consider your options for coverage.Insurance for cryptocurrency exchanges and digital asset holdersInsurance coverage against financial losses brought on by theft, fraud, hacking, disruptions to operations and legal liabilities specific to cryptocurrency exchanges helps protect digital asset holders.Additionally, these are insurance solutions tailored to protect blockchain-based assets, smart contracts, decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols and tokenized assets against various risks.Custodial insurance for digital assetsThis protects institutional investors and asset managers against the loss, theft or mishandling of crypto assets under their custody.                                                                    Key considerations for cryptocurrency insurance policies                                        Stakeholders should carefully consider the essential criteria listed in the “Key considerations for cryptocurrency insurance policies” section before choosing a cryptocurrency insurance policy. These factors ensure that their digital assets are adequately covered and protected by the selected policy. It places emphasis on determining the maximum amount of coverage, comprehending exclusions and limitations, complying with security specifications set by the insurers, analyzing premium costs, getting acquainted with the claims procedure, and choosing reliable insurers with a track record in the cryptocurrency insurance market. These actions are essential for reducing potential risks connected with cryptocurrency ownership and trading and for helping users make well-informed decisions. Furthermore, preserving eligibility and enhancing overall security necessitate conforming to strict security criteria enforced by insurers, such as putting in place strong security measures and following industry best practices. Optimizing the cost-effectiveness of the insurance investment is made possible by assessing how affordable premiums are in relation to the amount of protection provided. Comprehending the claims procedure, which encompasses the necessary documents and dispute resolution processes, promotes effective correspondence with insurance providers and ensures prompt claim settlement.                                                                    Traditional insurance vs. cryptocurrency insurance                                        While traditional insurance policies may offer some degree of coverage for digital assets, they often fall short of addressing the unique risks and complexities of the cryptocurrency ecosystem. Conventional or traditional insurance offers less transparency and a slower resolution since it relies on intermediaries like established companies, centralized governance and third-party custody. On the other hand, cryptocurrency insurance provides great transparency and expedited settlement times, frequently within minutes or hours, through the use of user-controlled wallets, blockchain technology and decentralized governance.Here’s a comparison between traditional insurance and cryptocurrency insurance:                                                                    Strategies to protect against cryptocurrency insurance fraud                                        Protecting against crypto insurance fraud in the context of blockchain requires a multipronged strategy. Performing thorough due diligence on insurers is crucial and should involve evaluating their financial stability, adherence to regulations, past claims experience and their reputation in the industry. Strong security protocols must also be put in place to protect digital assets. Identifying and neutralizing possible threats entail using encryption mechanisms, using multisignature wallets, using cold storage systems and continuously monitoring transactions and network activity.Creating and putting into practice thorough risk management protocols is also essential. The protocols ought to cover the recognition, evaluation and alleviation of risks related to cybersecurity, operational hazards and compliance that are inherent in the blockchain environment. An integral part of this strategy is the regular auditing and evaluation of security controls as well as compliance with industry standards and regulations.In addition, it is crucial to carefully examine insurance plans’ terms, conditions, exclusions and coverage limits to make sure they are in line with stakeholders’ financial goals and risk management strategies. Hiring impartial outside specialists, like cybersecurity companies, forensic auditors and attorneys, can offer important confirmation and insights into insurance coverage, security measures and adherence to industry norms.

SEC Says Ripple Victory Ruling for XRP Holds No Weight for Other Cases


							

SEC questions the legal influence of Ripple’s favorable ruling in its argument against Coinbase’s appeal.



The regulator claimed Ripple’s non-security status for XRP sales remains unendorsed by other courts.



A legal expert confirms Ripple’s ruling could be an isolated win in the industry.




The U.S. SEC has thrown shade on the decision of Judge Analisa Torres in the Ripple lawsuit, saying “no court has followed the ruling.” This critique was part of the SEC’s argument against Coinbase’s request for an interlocutory appeal. 



For context, in the SEC vs Ripple case, Judge Torres ruled in July 2023 that programmatic sales of XRP tokens through exchanges did not constitute securities offerings, thus not violating securities laws. This ruling affirmed that XRP is not a security, and token sales on exchanges do not constitute investment contracts.



However, the SEC’s recent complaint against Coinbase alleges that the cryptocurrency exchange has been acting as an unregistered intermediary for “crypto asset securities.” The SEC believes that the digital assets listed on Coinbase’s platform are securities, and sales through the platform are investment contracts. This view directly conflicts with Judge Torres’s ruling that tokens like XRP sold on exchanges are not securities.









Now, in their latest filing against Coinbase’s appeal, the SEC remarked that “no court has followed Ripple.” The argument implies that other courts have not echoed the legal reasoning or precedent established in the Ripple case and thus cannot apply in Coinbase’s case. 



This statement suggests that the SEC views the Ripple decision as an outlier, potentially lacking in legal influence or validity.



Reacting to the development, pro-XRP lawyer Bill Morgan suggested that if other courts do not adopt the SEC vs. Ripple case ruling and the SEC wins its other major crypto lawsuits, Ripple’s victory regarding programmatic sales would stand in isolation. 







Essentially, it would mean that Ripple could continue its programmatic sales unregistered. However, the ruling may not necessarily serve as a legal precedent for other entities in the crypto industry.

XRP set to rally as investors gear up for CPI data release

Technologists, investors, and owners of XRP eagerly look forward to the Consumer Price Index (CPI) data release, as the announcement could cause a potential rally for the price of XRP CPI data publication day draws near According to Matthew Dixon, the CEO of Evai, a crypto rating platform, a scooping drop in CPI may be the push needed to facilitate a significant positive climb in the price of XRP. Many market makers, participants, and even crypto sphere casual observers are waiting for the publication of the consumer price index (CPI) the data for which will be moved on May 17th.  Thus the economic indicator is a subject of speculation concerning its potential intrusion into different types of assets including cryptocurrencies. Among many analysts, including Dixon, the fact that a weak CPI number (latest CPI data) can potentially trigger an XRP price rally is a major factor that drives some market participants as well. Dixon’s bullish case for XRP is grounded on the unparalleled potential of digital assets, which present an innovative way to secure a decentralized financial system and support the accelerated development of smart contracts. He has mentioned that XRP is going to be a sleeping giant and soon it, is, going to, awaken. He said that if the surprising dip from CPI was less than expected, this could be the catalyst for XRP to reach new highs. The Federal Reserve is driven by this statement because the Fed takes a snapshot of the American inflation data.  If the data is then reflected to be rising, the Fed may think of a rate cut. Market trends and possible consequencesDixon’s bullish case is founded on the inverted link between interest rates and asset prices, which exists between the traditional markets and the digital currencies as well. If the Fed’s monetary stance tends to support the low interest rates approach due to a loss in momentum of inflation, investors could invest in speculative investments such as cryptocurrencies since they offer higher returns than low-risk assets. Hence, XRP, being known for its potential to assist with international transfers, would likely have more people acquiring it and, in return, push its price upwards.  Despite Dixon’s prediction having drawn recognition from crypto community members, some industry veterans are skeptical and still treat the cryptocurrency market as a speculative trading instrument. Nonetheless, the idea of a ripe XRPdrop has interested enthusiasts in investors while they are watching for the total value of the Consumer Price Index Data Release to be made public.

Bitcoin Crashes Below $61K as Altcoins Take Massive Beating (Weekend Watch)


																The past 24 hours haven’t treated the cryptocurrency market well, with most coins trading well in the red.
Bitcoin plummeted below $61K, while the majority of altcoins are also charting considerable losses. Let’s have a closer look.
Bitcoin Price Crashes Suddenly
BTC was trading relatively flat throughout the week, failing to break out in either direction and maintaining its stance at around $63K.
This all changed yesterday when the cryptocurrency took a massive hit and plunged rather suddenly toward $60K.
Source: CoinGecko
The volatility induced over $200 million worth of liquidated positions over the past 24 hours and seemed to have been triggered by a statement from a representative of the US Federal Reserve.


Thanks for subscribing, you will get your first report in the next hours!


Speaking at a conference in New Orleans, the President of the Dallas Fed – Lorie Logan – suggested that it may be “too early to think about rate cuts.”
I need to see some of these uncertainties resolved about the path that we’re on, and we need to remain very flexible.
The market didn’t take this well, and all the charts are painted in red.
Altcoins Bleed Out Heavily
Trading at $60,800 at the time of this writing, BTC’s price is down 3.5% in the past 24 hours.
If that sounds bad, don’t look at the following heatmap.
Source: Quantify Crypto
ETH lost 4.1%, SOL is down 6%, and DOT crashed by almost 6% as well – similar to a lot of other coins such as BCH, AVAX, and UNI.
Although prices have stabilized throughout the past few hours, market analysts are monitoring the action closely to determine whether the bears are done or if another assault is inbound.
Theta Network (THETA), alongside THORChain (RUNE) are the coins that lost the most during the past 24 hours, down 10.8% and 9.2%, respectively.
On the other hand, Cheelee (CHEEL) and Akash Network (AKT) were able to curb the damage, increasing by around 3% throughout the same period.

How Will November's US Presidential Election Affect Bitcoin and Cryptocurrencies? Bullish or Bearish? - Bitcoin Sistemi

QCP Capital, a leading cryptocurrency analysis firm, recently discussed the potential impact of the upcoming US elections on Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. The firm stated that historically markets have shown an upward trend towards elections.
However, according to analysts, this year's elections may experience a unique dynamic due to the increasing interest in cryptocurrencies among voters.


Former President Donald Trump is making moves towards the crypto community, which could influence his rival Joe Biden to take a similar stance. Trump's appeal to crypto enthusiasts marks a significant shift from his first term, when he was more critical of the industry. Trump's direct embrace of cryptocurrencies is seen as a turning point for the industry, which has lobbied heavily in Washington and invested heavily to influence the outcome of the 2024 elections.
At an event where he introduced his own non-fungible token (NFT), Trump urged crypto supporters to vote for him, citing regulatory crackdowns on the industry under the Biden administration. “They are against cryptocurrencies,” he said, referring to the Democrats' approach to cryptocurrencies.






The Republican party has become increasingly friendly towards Bitcoin and other digital assets in recent years. By contrast, key Democrats are divided on whether to legitimize the industry after a series of scandals.
“President Trump's statements signal a shift in the importance of digital assets this election cycle,” said Kristin Smith, CEO of the Blockchain Association, a top crypto industry lobby group.


The firm also stated that markets will likely continue to price in rate cuts unless the FED explicitly rejects rate cuts or gives hints of rate hikes. This could have significant impacts on the crypto market, which is often influenced by broader economic trends.

Whales Accumulate Nearly $1 Billion Worth of Bitcoin in Just 1 Day Despite Price Drops ⋆ ZyCrypto

&nbsp

&nbsp
In a surprising turn of events during the recent price correction, Bitcoin whales have demonstrated a strong vote of confidence in the leading cryptocurrency by accumulating nearly $1 billion worth of BTC within a mere 24-hour period. This massive accumulation, totaling 15,121 BTC, marks the highest level of whale activity in two weeks and suggests a significant shift in market sentiment.



Bitcoin’s Movements and Impact of Whale Activity



Bitcoin’s price has been more volatile than usual in recent weeks. It’s been ranging from $60,000 to $64,000, and whales have taken the opportunity to increase their holdings. This accumulation wave follows after selling and profit-taking activities from investors, which shows conviction even at higher prices.



Santiment, a leading blockchain analytics platform, views this move as a clear signal of whales’ confidence in Bitcoin as an asset. Moreover, industry experts cite this surge in accumulation as the beginning of a re-accumulation phase, potentially paving the way for a bullish reversal soon.



Increased Bullish Sentiment



The timing of this accumulation is interesting because inflows into the Bitcoin network have been steadily increasing. About a week ago, Bitcoin Whales acquired a staggering 47,000 BTC in a single day, valued at almost $3 billion. This influx of capital into the market led CryptoQuant CEO Ki Young Ju to suggest that this may start a new chapter for Bitcoin.



Further reinforcing the bullish sentiment, prominent Bitcoin analyst Willy Woo recently observed renewed interest from BTC investors. While he mentioned that it may take some time to confirm this trend reversal, the underlying data suggests a growing appetite for Bitcoin among institutional players.

&nbsp



Reduced Selling Pressure



Additionally, on-chain metrics looked at by analysts from Bitfinex show a potential weakening of selling pressure for Bitcoin. This, coupled with positive flows in the U.S. spot Bitcoin ETF market, further highlights the growing conviction in Bitcoin’s long-term potential.



The recent whale accumulation of nearly $1 billion worth of Bitcoin in just one day is a clear bullish signal for the crypto market as a whole. Despite short-term price fluctuations, institutional and large-scale investors remain certain in their belief in Bitcoin’s value proposition. As the market enters a re-accumulation phase, all eyes are on Bitcoin’s trajectory, with many anticipating its next move.

What is BounceBit: Liquid Restaking on Bitcoin


																The concept of liquid restaking, a topic that has gained significant popularity in recent quarters, offers users the exciting possibility to extract additional value from their staked tokens.
Predominantly, however, this has been applied throughout a variety of Ethereum-based applications.
BounceBit, on the other hand, is delivering a BTC restaking infrastructure designed to provide a foundational layer for various restaking products.
In the following guide, we take a closer look at how BounceBit works, the tokenomics behind its native cryptocurrency, and more. Let’s dive in.
Quick Navigation

What is Liquid Restaking?
Before we explain what BounceBit does, it’s important to understand the concept of liquid restaking that we mentioned above.
You might be familiar with liquid staking protocols and their liquid staking tokens (LSTs). It’s a mechanism that came to prominence with protocols like Lido. Users are able to stake their ETH into Lido (or other protocols) and receive a synthetic representation of this ETH. This is a new token that’s supposed to be pegged to the value of ETH 1:1. They could then use this synthetic ETH to carry out various operations with other protocols that support it.
Liquid restaking, on the other hand, is a process aimed at increasing the economic security of external systems. In essence, you can take your synthetic ETH (your LST) and restake it, receiving another token called a liquid restaking token.
As mentioned above, most of the LRT protocols are increasingly focused on Ethereum because of its Proof of Stake architecture.
BounceBit, on the other hand, is building a BTC restaking infrastructure that’s designed to provide a layer for restaking products on the Bitcoin network.
How do they do it? Well, let’s find out.

What is BounceBit?
In a bid to reimagine Bitcoin’s value, BounceBit proposes an infrastructure designed based on the conviction that Bitcoin should be predominantly asset-driven at the infrastructure level.
BounceBit differentiates itself as a Proof of Stake layer one ecosystem where validators are required to stake BTC and the native BounceBit token. This establishes a dual-token security system that’s aimed at strengthening the network itself but also at improving the intrinsic value of Bitcoin by providing its holders with an active role in validating the BounceBit network.
The goal is to provide a symbiotic relationship between BounceBit’s native token and BTC in an attempt to create a versatile and resilient network.
BounceBit also leverages interoperability with other networks that are EVM-compatible, incorporating staked assets such as BTCB on the “Build ‘N’ Build” (BNB) Chain and Wrapped Bitcoin (WBTC).
Now, it’s worth noting that when t comes to generating yield on BTC – there is a very unique challenge that’s inherently different from yield-generation protocols associated with Ethereum. The Bitcoin protocols can’t yield returns when the BTC is held within multi-signature wallets. This is what BounceBit confronts by integrating a centralized finance (CeFi) approach, taking advantage of Mainnet Digital’s custody services, as well as Ceffu’s MirrorX technology stack.
This essentially allows Bitcoin to maintain its presence on-chain, while also engaging in trading activities on centralized exchanges.
What Problems Does BounceBit Solve?

Tackling Lack of Transparency

Those who were around in 2022 remember the transparency issues that plagued the industry through the likes of Celsius and others.
BounceBit incorporates on-chain proof-of-reserve (PoR), while also maintaining transparent activities in a bid to restore the trust and deliver a secure platform that allows BTC holders to earn interest.

Undoutedbly, BTC holders face the challenge of their assets being underutilized. BounceBit seeks to tackle this challenge by providing them with a means of actively engaging their assets in the thriving sectors of decentralized finance and NFTs.

Improving Bitcoin Utility by Enabling Additional Use Cases

By extension of the above, BounceBit also commits to expanding the overall utility of BTC and Bitcon’s network as a whole. The goal is to broaden the scope of opportunities for BTC holders and leverage the cryptocurrency as a major asset.

Unifying BTC Across Chains

BounceBit identifies the absence of a smart contract platform within Bitcoin’s ecosystem as limiting the overall development of dApps and works to provide one.

Understanding BounceBit’s Infrastructure
BounceBit is building a network that leverages the well-known Proof-of-Stake (PoS) consensus algorithm to rethink conventional staking models that focus on a single token. They call this approach Dual-Token Proof of Stake (PoS).

In light of the above, it’s worth explaining that the protocol’s architecture incorporates a number of node operators. These can be selected as validators. These are parties that have to stake BB (the native token of BounceBit) and/or BBTC (staked BTC on the BounceBit chain). Their job is to record and verify the transactions on the network and as a reward – they receive transaction fees. As it’s a hybrid model, validators can choose to accept BBTC and/or BB tokens.
The purpose of accepting BTC, albeit staked, in the consensus mechanism, is to bootstrap the protocol with the deep liquidity that Bitcoin’s network has to offer, while also taking advantage of its relatively lower volatility.


Sustainable Validator Economics


In a bid to balance the requirements for operating the network, BounceBit empowers its validators to charge a commission on the staking rewards. This is an approach that attempts to ensure that validators are compensated appropriately for the important role that they play in maintaining the robustness and functionality of the network.

BounceBit’s chain is fully compatible with both the Ethereum Virtual Machine and with Solidity. The latter is the programming language that’s predominantly used to create smart contracts for Ethereum. This ensures that the migration for developers would be seamless while also leveraging the proven security and abundant ecosystem of Ethereum.


BounceClub: For Owners and Members


The BounceClub takes inspiration from Apple Inc.’s strive for innovation. It is an on-chain Web3 world where users are empowered to customize, launch, and engage with various dApps.
For BounceClub Owners -> If you meet the criteria to own a BounceClub, you will be able to select desired protocols from the BounceBit App Store and customize the space seamlessly and in a very user-friendly way. There’s a complete guide on it that you can find here.
For BounceClub Members -> Say you’re not interested in operating a BounceClub, you can still browse the various clubs that are created by other users and engage in different Web3 activities. You would only need to get your wallet connected.

The main purpose of the BTC bridge within BounceBit’s ecosystem is to provide a secure way of transferring BTC between Bitcoin’s network and other EVM Chains, including BounceBit.
It is a critical component of the functionality and the completion of BounceBit’s vision and purpose.
It’s important to note that network validators are responsible for maintaining the security of the bridge. Each validator also operates a bridge node. They contribute to the signing of cross-chain messages, taking the multi-signature approach multiple steps further. You can find out more about the BounceBit BTC bridge here.
The Liquid Staking Tokens
BounceBit has a native liquid staking smart contract. If users opt-in to stake their BB or BTC, they will receive an LST (liquid staking token). These are:

stBB – derived from staking BB
stBBTC – derived from staking BBTC (BTC staked on BounceBit)

These can be later restaked to Shared Security Clients with the aims of aggregating security and unlocking liquidity of staked assets. LSTs can be redeemed here by simply unstaking. Following the redemption request, users have to wait for 24 hours before they can claim.
BounceBit Economy: Everything You Need to Know About BB Tokenomics
First things first, BounceBit’s economy is primarily composed of three types of actors, all of which are relatively self-explanatory:

Users
BB Holders
Node operators

BB is the native token that powers the BounceBit platform. The total supply is capped at 2.1 billion (paying homage to the number of 21 million – Bitcoin’s capped supply.)
BB tokens can be used in multiple ways, so we will list a few of them:

Use BB to take part in the on-chain governance process
Stake BB to participate in the PoS Dual-token mechanism (read above)
BB is paid out as a reward for validators who secure the network
It’s the denomination of gas fees on the network

Here’s what the token release schedule looks like:

This is the BB token distribution:
Testnet & TVL Incentive: 4%
Investors: 21%
Team: 10%
Advisors: 5%
Binance Megadrop: 8%
Market Making: 3%
BounceClub & Ecosystem Reserve: 14%
Staking Reward & Delegation Program: 35%

The Binance Megadrop: Step by Step Guide
As you can see, the Binance Megadrop has 8% of the total supply reserved for it. It is a new token launch platform that’s designed to integrate Binance’s Simple Earn and the Web3 Wallet of the company.
It aims to provide users with early access to certain Web3 projects well before they are listed on the exchange.
The following is a step-by-step guide on how to participate in the Binance Megadrop for BounceBit.
There are two ways to participate, and both require a Binance account.
You can register one using this link and also earn a $600 welcome bonus as an exclusive deal for CryptoPotato readers!
Now that your account is ready, the first thing you can do is navigate to the Megadrop section and lock your BNB to earn scores. From there, you can subscribe to your BNB and lock it for a certain period of time, thus earning a score.

As you can see, the longer the subscription period, the higher the multiplier is.
The next thing you can do is complete Web3 quests. To do so, you will need the Binance Web3 Wallet. You can create one from your Binance mobile application. Navigate to your “wallets” tab at the bottom and then tap on the “Web3” at the top.

From here, simply follow the instructions, and your Web3 wallet will be generated. Now that your wallet is complete, navigate back to the Megadrop section and hit the “Start Quest” at the bottom – you will have to stake with BounceBit.
From there on, you can follow the instructions, which will guide you toward quest completion.
The total score you receive will be a combination of your Locked BNB score, your Web3 quest multiplier, and will also add your Web3 quest bonus. So the formula looks like this:
Total Score = (Locked BNB Score * Web3 Quest Multiplier) + Web3 Quest Bonus.
If you fail to finish all the quests, you will receive a multiplier of just 1.

MarginFi To Launch Solana LST-Backed Decentralized Stablecoin This Month - The Defiant

MarginFi said XBY will be the first major decentralized stablecoin on Solana.MarginFi, the sixth-largest DeFi protocol on Solana by TVL, announced it expects to launch XBY, its yield-accruing decentralized stablecoin, this month.Speaking during the Solana Crossroads 2024 conference, MacBrennan Peet, the co-founder of MarginFi, said his team is in the process of wrapping up the second audit for XBY and aims to launch the stablecoin before June.Peet said XBY will be entirely collateralized by SOL-based liquid staking protocols (LSTs), providing Solana with a decentralized stablecoin that can offset the network’s reliance on USDC, the second-largest centralized stablecoin.“Solana DeFi as a whole right now is completely reliant on USDC,” Peet said. "If USDC depegged like it did a year ago and stayed depegged, Solana DeFi would be in a really rough spot — USDC underlines all major trading pairs."He added that the project has already secured roughly $12 million in initially committed liquidity, and hopes to attract more than $100 million before launching.The news of XBY’s impending launch comes one month after MarginFi’s co-founder and CEO, Edgar Pavlovsky, abruptly resigned from the project. The move appeared to result from an apparent disagreement over whether the project should launch a governance token despite early users already accruing points — which typically qualify holders for future airdrops.Many MarginFi users rushed to remove their assets from the protocol in response to Pavlovsky stepping down, with more than $300 million or close to half of MarginFi’s TVL leaving the protocol over just a few days.However, Peet said Pavlosky’s exit was not due to differences over whether the project would launch a token, instead attributing the decision to the stress demands placed on Pavlovsky as CEO.“There wasn’t really any disagreements over a token,” Peet said. “It’s really stressful — this is a 24/7 job, there’s no weekends in building an on-chain finance protocol.”Peet also confirmed that MarginFi will launch a governance token in the future and is quietly working on building out its governance token."MarginFi is designed to be decentralized, to have a token,” Peet said. “The Margin Foundation isn’t as interested in putting out a token just for the sake of putting out a token. We’re interested in having a token where it means something and where it has embedded real governance weight."Peet added that the heavy withdrawals comprised robust “stress-testing” for MarginFi, with the protocol continuing to operate smoothly despite the heavy withdrawals.XBY stablecoinXBY will comprise a rebasing stablecoin, meaning users’ balances will increase as yield is accrued to the token.XBY yields will initially come from the staking rewards generated from the token’s LST collateral, with holders also set to earn MarginFi lending yields at a later date. Peet noted that MarginFi users have already deposited “hundreds of millions of dollars in LSTs” onto the protocol that can be used as collateral for XBY minting from the moment the protocol is live.Peet said that “major protocols and DEXes” within Solana’s DeFi ecosystem plan to support XBY, providing additional opportunities for users to generate yield.Peet acknowledged that XBY’s market cap will be constrained by the capitalization of SOL-based LSTs, adding that MarginFi intends to expand its supported collateral in the future.“We’re very focused on starting with LSTs, but that doesn’t mean doesn’t mean we can’t expand outside of that,” Peet said. “There's a lot of other options outside of USDT or USDC, for example, in terms of forms of collateral.”Peet also revealed that MarginFI plans to launch the first “integrated stableswap” feature following XBY’s deployment. The product will allow users to trade between stablecoins using the existing liquidity deposited in MarginFi, meaning users will simultaneously earn lending yields and swap fees.

How Solana dApps can help SOL in Q2 2024 - AMBCrypto



Solana ecosystem witnessed an uptick in activity and development activity.
Interest in Solana’s DeFi and NFTs declined.

Solana [SOL] attracted large amounts of activity on its network due to the recent popularity of its meme coins.
However, it’s not just the meme coins that have been attracting users to the Solana network – dApps on the Solana network have also played a crucial part.
Taking a look at Solana’s ecosystem
Popular dApps such as Wormhole, Jupiter and Pyth network have managed to gain a large number of active addresses over the past few weeks.
Development Activity on these dApps also grew, which suggested that the new updates and upgrades might be on the way. These new developments could help attract even more users to the network.
Source: Santiment
Over the past few weeks, the number of daily transactions occurring on the Solana network had grown from 20 million to 30 million.
However, the number of daily active addresses on the network had remained the same.
This indicated that the high number of transactions on the network were not being driven by new addresses but the same old ones.
Source: Artemis
Some challenges ahead
In the DeFi sector, the Solana network faced some problems. The DEX (Decentralized Exchange) volumes on the network fell significantly over the last few days. Coupled with that, the TVL (Total Value Locked) began to stagnate.
Source: Artemis
Solana was also observed to be seeing a decline in interest in its NFT sector. AMBCrypto’s analysis of Solana Floor’s data indicated that the total floor value of Solana NFTs had fallen significantly over the last few days.
The volume of NFTs being sold on the Solana network had also declined during this period.
Source: SolanaFloor
These factors could impact the Solana ecosystem negatively and prove to be a hindrance in the growth of the ecosystem, going forward.

Read Solana’s [SOL] Price Prediction 2024-25

A waning interest in Solana’s ecosystem may have adverse impacts on the price of the SOL token as well. At press time, SOL was trading at $146.24 and its price had declined by 4.84% in the last 24 hours. 
The volume at which SOL was trading at had also fallen by 9.53% during this period.

Tron DeFi On Fire: Ecosystem Surges Past $21 Billion Milestone


								The Tron decentralized finance (DeFi) space is on fire, exceeding a staggering $21.7 billion in total value locked (TVL), according to recent reports. This surge signifies a robust and flourishing DeFi ecosystem on the Tron blockchain. However, investors should be aware of a potential short-term dip in the price of Tron’s native token, TRX.

Tron DeFi: A Haven For Crypto Investors
The TVL metric serves as a crucial indicator of DeFi activity, reflecting the total value of crypto assets deposited within DeFi protocols. Tron’s surpassing of the $21.7 billion mark signifies a significant influx of user funds and a growing appetite for Tron-based DeFi offerings.
This positive trend is further amplified by the success of leading projects like Just Cryptos, boasting a TVL of $7.1 billion, and JustLend DAO, a lending and staking platform with a TVL of $6.4 billion. Both protocols have witnessed impressive growth in recent times, highlighting the vibrancy of Tron’s DeFi landscape.


Beyond The Headlines: A Stellar Q1 For Tron
Tron’s success story extends beyond its thriving DeFi ecosystem. Recent data from Messari reveals a stellar first quarter of 2024 for the network. Tron witnessed positive growth across various key metrics, including market cap, revenue generation, and user base.

TXR is now trading at $0.12. Chart: TradingView
Notably, Tron’s Q1 revenue reached a record-breaking $128 million, solidifying its position among the top revenue-generating blockchain networks. Furthermore, March saw a significant surge in daily active addresses (DAAs) on the Tron network, surpassing a remarkable 2 million mark.
This surge in user activity underscores the network’s growing popularity and user adoption. Additionally, Tron celebrated a significant milestone by exceeding 200 million total accounts, signifying a continuously expanding user base.
Short-Term Jitters In TRX Price
While Tron’s DeFi and overall network performance paint a rosy picture, investors should be mindful of a potential short-term price dip in TRX. Over the past 24 hours, the price of TRX has experienced a slight decline of 1%.

Over the past week, TRX has demonstrated resilience with a 1.32% increase, even outperforming the global cryptocurrency market.
The Road Ahead
Tron’s DeFi ecosystem is experiencing phenomenal growth, attracting significant user investment and fostering a thriving community. The network’s overall performance in Q1 2024 was impressive, with positive growth across multiple metrics. However, investors should be aware of a potential short-term price dip in TRX, as suggested by technical indicators.

Avalanche (AVAX) Price Dips As Market Turbulence Persists


																AVAX is the native utility token of the Avalanche blockchain. The token is currently ranked 12th by market cap, with a total supply of 440,043,419 AVAX and a total trading volume of over $396,250,098 in the last 24 hours. Since its recent pullback at $36.15, AVAX has continued to move downward.
Currently, the general cryptocurrency market is bearish. This has led to the price of AVAX dropping below the 100-day Simple Moving Average (SMA) and the price might continue to drop in the next couple of days. As of the time of writing, the price of AVAX was trading around $33.52 and about 0.22% down in the last 24 hours.
Technical Indicators Point Toward A Sustained Downtrend For AVAX
To figure out where the AVAX price might be headed next, the following indicators can be used to examine the chart.
4-Day MACD: A technical look at the MACD indicator from the 4-hour timeframe, the MACD histograms are trending below the zero line, and both the MACD line and the Signal line crossed each other while trending below the MACD zero line, indicating a continuous movement on the downside. This can be seen in the below image.

4-Day RSI: The formation of the Relative Strength Index (RSI) in the above image also suggests a downward continuation movement as the RSI signal line is seen to have moved above the 50% level and then dropped below it. This suggests that sellers are still very much active in the market therefore overpowering the strength of buyers.
Alligator Indicator: A look at the alligator indicator from the 4-hour time frame shows that AVAX is trading below the alligator lines as the alligator lip and teeth have both successfully crossed above the alligator jaw. It can also be seen that the price tried to move above the alligator lines but failed to do so, suggesting that the price might continue to move in its downward direction.

The Coin Could Form A New Low
Conclusively, from the previous downward movement, AVAX has formed two resistance levels of $39.94 and $36.15 and a support level of $30.34. Currently, AVAX is moving toward this support level and if it breaks above this level, the price might drop even further to create a new low. 
On the contrary, if the price fails to break above this support, it will reverse and start an upward movement toward its previous resistance level of $36.15. Should AVAX manage to break above this resistance level, the price might move further to test the $39.94 resistance level.

Ethereum ETFs: Here Are All the Applications Awaiting SEC Approval - Decrypt

We do the research, you get the alpha!Get exclusive reports and access to key insights on airdrops, NFTs, and more! Subscribe now to Alpha Reports and up your game!Go to Alpha ReportsFollowing the historic approval of 11 spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds in January, industry observers are now wondering when the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) could give the green light to an Ethereum equivalent. For those who don’t know, an exchange-traded fund (ETF) is a popular investment vehicle that trades on a stock exchange. It allows investors to buy shares that track the price of an underlying asset—which could be anything from gold and foreign currencies to crypto and tech stocks. If approved, a spot Ethereum ETF—just like a Bitcoin one—would mean a fund manager would take care of buying and storing the ETH digital coins, and invite people to buy shares that track their value. This would give people exposure to the second biggest cryptocurrency by market cap. Several prestigious financial firms have filed S-1 forms with the SEC. In short, companies file such forms to alert the regulator that they plan to offer securities to the public, and to provide a detailed breakdown of their business. Here are the filings currently sitting on the SEC’s desk awaiting approval. The SEC decision deadline for the proposed products varies from end of May to early August.BlackRockBlackRock, the world’s biggest asset manager, filed an S-1 form for its proposed iShares Ethereum Trust back in November. The SEC delayed making a decision on the fund manager’s potential product earlier this year and now has until August 7. The firm’s CEO, Larry Fink, is seemingly enthusiastic about the cryptocurrency and its network, and has said that there is “value in having an Ethereum ETF.” He has also talked about “tokenization” being inevitable. GrayscaleCrypto asset manager Grayscale is awaiting an answer from the SEC after filing a proposal in October to convert its Grayscale Ethereum Trust into a spot Ethereum ETF. The current trust right now operates like a closed-end fund; the idea is that as an ETF, it would be easier for investors to redeem shares. Its Bitcoin Trust converted into an ETF in January, so there’s already precedent for how such a crypto vehicle can transition over to a spot ETF.Grayscale is a big part of the reason why Bitcoin ETFs are trading in the U.S. right now. In a landmark moment for the crypto industry last year, a judge sided with the firm in a lawsuit, agreeing with the firm that Wall Street’s biggest regulator lacked a coherent explanation for denying its proposed conversion to a Bitcoin ETF after years of denials.The ruling paved the way for the SEC to give the green light to spot Bitcoin ETFs. Despite this, the SEC doesn’t appear to be in a hurry to say yes to the latest approval—it pushed back on giving a decision in January. The regulator now has until June 18 to say yes or no. And just last month, the firm filed for a “mini” Ethereum Trust as well. The idea with the fund is that it would have lower fees for shareholders. Ark Invest/21SharesCathie Wood’s heavyweight tech investment management firm, ARK Invest, filed a proposal with the SEC for an Ethereum ETF back in September. The ETF is in partnership with crypto ETF issuer 21Shares and names Coinbase, America’s biggest digital asset exchange, as its custodian—meaning that the recognized company would hold and store the ETH in the product. The decision deadline for the product is May 24. FidelityFinancial services giant Fidelity made it clear that it wanted to drop an Ethereum ETF back in November when Cboe—the exchange where the product would trade—filed a 19b-4 on behalf of the firm. Then, in March, the massive firm filed its S-1 with the SEC for its Fidelity Ethereum Fund. The SEC will make a decision on the product on August 3. VanEckAsset manager VanEck was the first fund manager to file a proposal for an Ethereum ETF with the SEC back in 2021. It later that year withdrew its proposal and has since filed again. The firm’s Bitcoin ETF has been a successful product, and VanEck even waived its fees to better compete with the other funds on the market. On May 23, the SEC is due to give a decision on the product. HashdexThe Nasdaq in September filed a proposal on behalf of Brazilian fund manager Hashdex for its Hashdex Nasdaq Ethereum ETF. Hashdex has several crypto ETFs already trading in Brazil. In the U.S., its Hashdex Bitcoin ETF was given the green light by the SEC in January but isn’t yet trading on a stock exchange. It said in March that it would convert its Bitcoin futures ETF into the spot ETF at a later date. The SEC will give a decision on May 30. Franklin TempletonWall Street giant Franklin Templeton entered the race in February when it filed a proposal with the SEC. Its filing for the proposed Franklin Ethereum Trust mentions staking, the process of locking up digital coins or tokens to keep a blockchain ticking along. Its proposal says that it “may, from time to time, stake a portion of the Fund’s assets through one or more trusted staking providers.” The SEC will make a decision on the product on June 11.Invesco/Galaxy DigitalAsset management giant Invesco submitted a proposal with Mike Novogratz’s Galaxy Digital for an ETH ETF back in September. The S-1 form mentions that Invesco would be the sponsor for the product, while Galaxy Digital would work as its “execution agent”—selling ETH to pay the Invesco Galaxy Ethereum ETF’s expenses. The SEC will approve, deny, or delay the product on July 7.BitwiseDigital asset investment firm Bitwise filed its S-1 form with the SEC to offer a spot Ethereum ETF back in March. Like Franklin Templeton’s filing, Bitwise also mentions staking, noting that its Bitwise Ethereum Trust may stake a portion of the fund's assets through trusted staking providers to earn additional rewards. Matt Hougan, Chief Investment Officer at Bitwise, has said that he expects ETH ETFs to launch in December—and predicted they would be more successful if approved later in the year anyway. Edited by Andrew HaywardStay on top of crypto news, get daily updates in your inbox.

Like Bitcoin Founder Satoshi, Pi Creator Turns Into Myste...


                                Pi's Creator Nicolas Kokkalis Missing for an Extended Period                                Before the Pi Network Mainnet goes live people on social media platforms have invented trends that taking place. Before the network goes live, miners mine massive amounts of Pi coins hoping to make money by selling their tokens. Thus, the trend carries on and the Pi team ensures that the network and Pi Coin are being informed regularly about these activities. However, something about Pi is different. The founder of Pi Network, Dr. Nicolas Kokkalis has allegedly been absent from the company for a lengthy period and has recently resigned. Plenty have commented on the fact that Dr. Nicolas Kokkalis's absence now has become a significant mystery. People on social media develop their hypothesis which they spread on the internet. Nicolas Kokkalis's Mystery is creating RumorsSome people even guess if Nicolas Kokkalis is still alive or dead. Many individuals debated the validity of the Pi Network, once the contents of this software were publicized. Some people are asking for the verification of the Pi Network while others don't trust it and this has led to the concerns being raised in the social media circles. So far, the Pi Network team has not made any of this supposed story about Dr. Nicolas Kokkalis official but remained silent on the matter.This situation has given the owners of Pi another reason to live in fear. Nevertheless, one of his old comments has shown up in the media, giving the perception of sensational news.  This could be an attempt to get people to discover his trustworthiness. Yet, the chief question concerning the reason for the founder's disappearance is implied by him.Pi Creator's story Sounds similar to the Bitcoin Founder's Story                  The question of why Dr. Nicolas Kokkalis, the founder of Pi, has gone missing makes us think of the Satoshi Nakamoto story—the one about the person who invented Bitcoin. After the charity of 2008, the Bitcoin white paper was released in 2008, thus one year later in 2009, Bitcoin was distributed. In 2010, Bitcoin held the spotlight of mainstream media as the general public started to recognize and utilize it. Finally, in 2012 or so, a looming silence replaced Satoshi Nakamoto’s name and he stated that he would be concentrating on other things. Now, after almost a decade, no one has seen or heard of Satoshi Nakamoto, and he is still a mystery. This is the case with the disappearance of Nicolas Kokkalis, the founder of Pi Network, who adopted such a mysterious move as the toll of his protagonist's fictional character.Some think that maybe it is just a mere coincidence, instead of it being something more. It implies that maybe he is also working on some sort of marketing or preparations for the launching of the Pi Network on June 28th. Inviting clarification here may be on the wise, Wait till Pi Network begins to serve. This way, people will be able to learn the main idea and fat consistencies faster.Also Read: U.S. Contemplates Digital Asset Oversight Through FIT21

Crypto Analyst Says These Memecoins Could Be the ‘Largest Narrative’ Amid the November US Elections - The Daily Hodl


								A widely followed crypto trader says that the build-up to the US presidential election in November could send two memecoins soaring.
Pseudonymous crypto analyst Altcoin Sherpa tells his 216,000 followers on the social media platform X that meme tokens MAGA (TRUMP) and Jeo Boden (BODEN) could outperform due to election year excitement.










TRUMP is inspired by former president Donald Trump, who is running for president again. BODEN is inspired by US President Joe Biden, who is running for re-election against Trump and refers to a misspelling of his name.
“Current meme strategy for me: concentration in one sector, USA politics. I own TRUMP and I want to buy BODEN. Should be the largest narrative when the election stuff really gets going later this year. Trump is going to constantly be in the news and doing his normal antics.” 
Meanwhile, blockchain analytics platform Santiment is noticing an apparent correlation between the two memecoins’ price action and the behavior of the two candidates.
“Much of the attribution to these latest memecoin rises are going to Donald Trump and his pro-crypto endorsements. As shown, mentions of Trump soared near the cryptocurrency local bottom, along with Biden, who traders fear anti-crypto policies.”
Source: Santiment/X
TRUMP is trading for $5.40 at time of writing, down more than 7% in the last 24 hours. BODEN is trading for $0.303 at time of writing, a fractional decrease on the day.

Ethereum's Price Impending Drop to $2500


The crypto market has recently witnessed a downturn, marked by significant price drops in major assets like Ethereum and Bitcoin.
Particularly, Ethereum (ETH) seems to be grappling with pronounced bearish trends, leading many crypto analysts to predict further declines for the second-largest crypto by market capitalization.
Ethereum Risks Falling to $2500
According to a recent investor advisory by crypto research firm 10X Research, Ethereum’s potential descent to $2500 is a concern due to its weakened fundamentals. They noted Ethereum’s inconsistent performance in the current market cycle, a departure from its role as a catalyst for bullish runs in previous cycles.
The firm emphasized Ethereum’s impact on Bitcoin’s growth in this cycle, highlighting a strong correlation between the two, with an R-square of 95%. Ethereum’s declining fundamentals are seen as a hurdle to widespread fiat inflow into the crypto ecosystem, thereby impeding Bitcoin’s rise.


“Ethereum: the No.2 token in the world continues to disappoint both from the fundamental and technical perspectives. The below Daily Chart looks particularly weak to me. If 2950 breaks, we will easily see 2500-2600 range in a crash,” Daniel Yan, the Founder and CIO at Kryptanium Capital said.

Meanwhile, the poor price forecast may stem from reduced network activity on the mainnet, leading to record-low average transaction fees. According to blockchain analytical platform IntoTheBlock, an increasing number of transactions are now settled on Ethereum Layer 2s, with the three largest L2s accounting for a record 82% transaction share of all Ethereum transactions last month.

This coincides with developments concerning spot Ether exchange-traded fund (ETF) applications. On May 10, Ark 21 Shares revised their spot Ethereum ETF proposal, dropping staking plans. 
Bloomberg ETF analyst Eric Balchunas suggested that the alteration might aim to refine application documents based on SEC feedback, though there have been no comments on the application.

“While it may seem like this is them getting their docs in shape based on SEC comments (which would be good news) there hasn’t been any comments. So its prob either a Hail Mary or maybe trying to give SEC one less thing to use in their rejection. Not sure (yet),” Balchunas said.

Despite this, the amendment seems to have increased the likelihood of spot Ethereum ETF approval on Polymarket, an on-chain predictions protocol. Data on the site indicated that the approval chances nearly doubled to 14% as of May 10 following the applicants’ move.
Nevertheless, expectations for approval remain subdued due to the SEC’s reserved stance on Ethereum ETF applications.

Short squeeze alert for the week: Two cryptocurrencies with potential to skyrocket


Cryptocurrency short-sellers have benefited in the last two months amid a short-term downtrend for the crypto market since March. Conversely, Finbold has spotted two cryptocurrencies signaling potential short squeezes and price surges for next week.
In this context, bullish diverges appeared in the price charts and among notable technical indicators, signaling a trend reversal. This fuels the usual short-squeeze alerts: negative funding rates, short-position volume increases, and leverage liquidations accumulation at higher levels.
Moreover, a rising optimism in India with reopened doors for offshore crypto exchanges validates the market potential for the following weeks from a regulatory and fundamental perspective.


As a result, cryptocurrencies that hold significant imbalances in the derivatives market could be the first to skyrocket.
Short squeeze alert for Avalanche (AVAX)
Avalanche (AVAX) is one of the likely cryptocurrencies to suffer a short squeeze next week, potentially sending its price skyrocketing. In particular, considering a relevant weekly open interest for short positions among cryptocurrency traders.
This has increased the negative funding rates for AVAX, with short-sellers paying a 5.8% APR to long-position traders. Finbold retrieved this data from CoinGlass on May 11, alongside other relevant indicators.
Funding Rate Heatmap: AVAX. Source: CoingGlass
Notably, Avalanche’s 1-month liquidation heatmap shows a critical liquidity pool at $40 per token, which could become a short-squeeze target. A rally to this level would reward AVAX traders with over 17% quick gains from current prices at $34.

Bitcoin Cash (BCH) price skyrocketing potential
Similarly, Bitcoin Cash (BCH) has a notable negative funding rate of 10.06%, with the 10th highest open interest in the market.
Funding Rate Heatmap: BCH. Source: CoingGlass
Meanwhile, BCH could go as high as $625 after hitting the previous liquidation target of $500 in two short-squeeze events. This would result in gains from 16% to 45%, considering Bitcoin Cash currently trades at $430.

However, other factors could prevent the forecasted trend reversal and short squeezes for AVAX, BCH, or other cryptocurrencies. Traders must remain cautious while opening leveraged positions and speculating in this volatile landscape.

Here’s Why US Election Will Determine Future of Ethereum ETFs


							

Analysts argue that Ethereum spot ETFs may be delayed until the end of 2025. 



They cite the SEC’s lack of engagement and ETH’s uncertain regulatory standing.



However, Donald Trump becoming president could be a game-changer given his pro-crypto stance.




The fate of Ethereum spot exchange-traded funds (ETFs) in the United States appears to hang on the outcome of the upcoming presidential election. This outlook comes as expectations grow that the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) will deny current applications for Ethereum spot ETFs on May 23. 



Experts such as Bloomberg Intelligence analyst Eric Balchunas have voiced pessimistic views about ETH ETF approvals this month, citing SEC’s lack of engagement with issuers and Ethereum’s uncertain regulatory standing.



Moreover, they argued that the SEC’s ongoing investigation into the Ethereum Foundation further bolsters the skepticism. Balchunas believes that the approval of spot Ethereum ETFs may be delayed until at least the end of 2025. 



Upon denial this month, prospective issuers, such as BlackRock, Fidelity, and Ark Invest, are left with two tough choices: to follow in Grayscale’s footsteps and sue the SEC over the rejection or to wait and refile later.



Meanwhile, the U.S. election could be a game-changer, with the potential return of Donald Trump to the presidency. During an interview with CNBC in March, Trump asserted that his administration will allow Americans to pay for goods with Bitcoin. Additionally, Trump promised his government would not crack down on cryptocurrency.



Given Trump’s pro-crypto stance, Balchunas remarked, “If there’s a new president, you file again. Maybe you get approved. Or you sue. Either way, that will take a whole other year to play out.” Essentially, the upcoming election presents a critical juncture for the future of Ethereum ETFs.



Regarding taking legal action, despite Grayscale’s successful lawsuit against the SEC for Bitcoin spot ETFs, a similar legal battle for Ethereum ETFs seems unlikely. Grayscale has already faced over $12 billion in outflows after converting its Bitcoin trust into an ETF. 









As a result, the firm may not be eager to engage in another costly legal confrontation. Besides, other issuers are hesitant to antagonize the SEC, with the Bloomberg analyst stating, “None of these other firms want to piss off the SEC. Nobody else will step up.” 



With Trump as president, the crypto community expects that he would appoint a more favorable SEC chairman than Gary Gensler. If a new SEC chair is appointed by mid-2025 and filings are promptly resubmitted, the approval process could extend to December 2025.

Interpol Nigeria boosts cybersecurity with virtual asset training

The Nigerian Interpol, cybersecurity experts, and other members of the local intelligence community met to brainstorm ways to tackle the rising waves of cybercrime in the country.The brainstorming, which took place in the nation’s capital, Abuja, under the training platform organized by A&D Forensics in partnership with the Africa Stablecoin Consortium, was said to have been designed to position the Nigerian Interpol on how to mitigate crimes involving virtual assets, particularly stablecoins.According to blockchain specialist Chioma Onyekelu, the training session aimed to empower Interpol agents with the skills to leverage blockchain intelligence and analysis in tracing and prosecuting cybercriminals involved in cryptocurrency transactions, specifically those using Bitcoin and stablecoins.Source: Africa Stablecoin ConsortiumOnyekelu stated that cybercrime has evolved beyond traditional fiat currency, with criminals now exploiting virtual assets to commit various cyber offenses. As Nigeria’s Interpol receives cybercrime requests from international partners, it is crucial to enhance their capabilities through targeted training sessions. Given Nigeria’s growing involvement with virtual asset exchanges, Onyekelu explained that the training will enable officers to effectively address cybercrimes involving virtual assets, particularly stablecoins.Adedeji Owonibi, Senior Partner at A&D Forensics, told the press that the training was imperative due to the rising cybercrime trends in the country. He pointed out that, “A significant gap exists between the evolving cybercrimes and the capabilities of law enforcement agencies in Nigeria. As responsible corporate citizens, we recognized the need to bridge this gap and support our law enforcement agencies in staying updated and effectively combating cybercrimes.”Regarding the controversies generated by the recent introduction of the cybersecurity Levy, Owonibi argued that while cybersecurity may be controversial, the government has the authority to make decisions on matters that impact national security, emphasizing the importance of prioritizing the nation’s security interests.Related: Ghana’s crypto stamps honor king’s Silver JubileeOn Monday, the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) mandated banks and other payment service providers to begin deducting 0.5% of the total value of electronic transactions and remit to the National Cybersecurity Fund to be managed by the Office of the National Security Adviser (ONSA).Nigeria’s Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) is cracking down on cryptocurrency, banning peer-to-peer exchanges that use the naira, signaling a significant regulatory shift.The International Monetary Fund (IMF) recently recommended that Nigeria embrace crypto adoption through licensing global cryptocurrency exchanges as a part of its economic reformation measures.Magazine: What do crypto market makers actually do?

Led by Bitcoin, Ethereum, here's why the crypto market is down today - AMBCrypto



The crypto market is down today due to a significant correction phase.
Bitcoin struggles around the $56,000 support level, with technical indicators suggesting a potential reversal.

Checking the crypto market today, you will see nothing but red. The entire market seems to have tumbled, with Bitcoin [BTC] and Ethereum [ETH] taking most hits, dropping far below their critical support levels.
Bullish sentiments in the community seem to be almost completely gone. Once again, investors are panicking, possibly at the edge of giving up. So, what is going on? Why is the crypto market down now?
2024 is generally expected to be a highly bullish year for the markets. And it has. But we are currently dealing with a strong case of the corrections. 
Data from Coinglass shows us that both tokens have seen more inflows than outflows in the past twenty-four hours. Also, liquidations are relatively low.
On the 10th of May, titans of the U.S. banking sector, JPMorgan and Wells Fargo, made headlines with their disclosures of holding spot Bitcoin ETFs. 
Yet, this revelation has barely made a ripple in the overall market dynamics. Bitcoin, for one, seems stuck in a prolonged correction cycle, stubbornly testing investor patience.
Source: Coinglass
Why is the crypto market flailing?
The immediate support level for BTC now is somewhere around $56,000, for traders. Breakout is still imminent, as is widely expected by the community.
 Data from TradingView tells us that this is where fear and optimism collide, where traders hover between hope for a breakout and dread of further decline.
Bitcoin is retesting its former all-time high resistance levels, now as new support zones. 
This activity shows a typical case of RSI Bullish Divergence on the 4-hour chart, hinting that the downtrend’s momentum is losing steam and might soon reverse. 
Yet, the currency is still navigating through the perilous falling wedge pattern—a technical indicator suggesting that while the end of the tunnel may be near, the road remains filled with fear and uncertainty.
The community’s consensus leans towards an eventual breakout, which could catapult Bitcoin’s value to new heights, potentially reaching as high as $78,000 in the bullish surges to come. 
Source: TradingView
As for Ethereum, its current trajectory is slightly different from Bitcoin’s. The Ethereum derivatives market is showing signs of increased activity and investor interest, according to Glassnode. 
Open Interest has surged by 50%, indicating a strong engagement with Ethereum’s financial products.
However, despite these positive indicators in derivatives, Ethereum’s performance relative to Bitcoin this cycle is much slower. 
The lag in speculative interest, particularly from the Short-Term Holder group, is a cautious approach among these investors. 
Meanwhile, Long-Term Holders seem to remain on the sidelines, eyeing more lucrative opportunities for profit-taking in future rallies. 
Source: Glassnode
At press time, Ethereum was worth $2,897.

Read Bitcoin’s [BTC] Price Prediction 2024-25

Even as it battles through the current market downturn, the growing interest in its derivatives suggests that these holders may soon see the favorable conditions they are waiting for.
All in all, the reason for the retreat is that the market is still consolidating, and experts expect a breakout regardless. Investors are advised not to give up. 2024 is still crypto’s year.

PEPE Coin Gains Momentum, Eyes Continued Growth | Bitcoinist.com


								Despite the current downturn of the crypto market, PEPE coin has been one of the tokens that is still holding strong as its price is still trading above the 100-day Simple Moving Average (SMA) and the trendline.
The token whose total liquidity is valued at over $38 million and a 24-hour trading volume of over $4.9 million once dropped below the moving average, touched the trendline, and is currently trending above the moving average once again.
As of the time of writing, PEPE is still trending above both the 100-day SMA and the trendline. The price is currently trading at $0.00000872, indicating about 3.57% increase in the last 24 hours.
Technical Indicators Reveal Signs Of Continued Upward Movement For PEPE
4-hour RSI Indicator: Looking at the Relative Strength Index (RSI) indicator from the 4-hour timeframe, it can be observed that the RSI line is trending above the 50 level. This indicates the price is still bullish at the moment. Also, there is a divergence between the price action and the RSI line as indicated by the red lines in the image, which suggests a future potential drop in price.

4-hour MACD: Looking at the formation of the MACD indicator from the 4-hour timeframe in the above image, we can also see that both the MACD line and the signal line crossed above the MACD zero line suggesting a continuation of the uptrend. On the other hand, the MACD histogram is already trending above the MACD zero line, suggesting that the price of PEPE is still bullish.
4-hour Alligator: A look at the alligator indicator from the 4-hour time frame shows that the price of PEPE is trading above the alligator lines as the alligator lip and teeth are both above the alligator jaw. It can also be observed that the price dropped below the alligator line and then moved above the lines again, suggesting that the price might continue to move in the upward direction.

Final Note
Currently, the price of PEPE is moving toward the resistance level of $0.00000916 and if it manages to break past this level, it might move further up to retest its all-time high.
On the contrary, if the price fails to break above this resistance level, it will start to move downward toward its previous support level of $0.00000756. And if it breaks below the support level, it might even move further towards the $0.00000591 support level.

Here's why you should closely watch these 2 cryptocurrencies in May


In the short term, the cryptocurrency market is experiencing a prevalent trend of trading in the red zone following the Bitcoin (BTC) halving. Bitcoin, in particular, is at the forefront of uncertainty as it struggles to maintain its price above $60,000.
As May progresses, attention is directed towards whether historical post-halving patterns will manifest. Amidst this uncertainty, Finbold has identified two cryptocurrencies worth monitoring for their potential to stand out.
XRP
In May, XRP investors are closely monitoring the ongoing Ripple and Securities Exchange Commission (SEC) case, which is nearing its conclusion. XRP stakeholders anticipate that the case’s resolution will trigger a rally in the token, which has been labeled a “crypto zombie” due to its lack of significant movement.


In the latest development, the SEC filed its final reply in the lawsuit’s remedies stage, disputing Ripple’s assertion of non-recklessness and contesting “widespread uncertainty” regarding XRP’s legal status. Despite the court’s prior dismissal of Ripple’s “fair notice” defense, XRP’s value declined.
The SEC continues to question whether Ripple may engage in similar actions in the future despite no rule violations since the 2020 XRP lawsuit began. Additionally, the SEC rejected Ripple Labs’ $10 million settlement offer for allegedly selling XRP to institutional investors, insisting on a $2 billion penalty and deeming Ripple’s offer insufficient.
Positive developments favoring Ripple could potentially boost XRP, targeting a rally towards $1, with market attention focused on the token’s ability to maintain strength above the $0.50 support level. 
According to Evai CEO Matthew Dixon, the upcoming Consumer Price Index (CPI) report, scheduled for release on May 15, could awaken XRP, which he described as a “sleeping giant.” Dixon believes a weaker-than-expected CPI reading could be a bullish catalyst, potentially propelling XRP above the $0.60 mark.

Furthermore, market participants will closely monitor Ripple XRP token unlocks, which could impact the token’s valuation.
By press time, XRP was trading at $0.50, experiencing a 24-hour loss of over 2%. On the weekly chart, XRP has declined by over 6%.

Toncoin (TON)
Despite prevailing bearish market sentiments, Telegram-linked Toncoin (TON) stands out as one of the cryptocurrencies exhibiting significant gains. Recent data from Santiment revealed that Toncoin has achieved the fastest network growth among leading cryptocurrencies over the past six months.
During this period, the network saw a more than doubling of non-zero wallets to 16.8k. In contrast, major cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum (ETH) experienced growth rates of 10% and 11%, respectively.
Cryptocurrencies wallet balances. Source: Santiment
In the short term, TON is trading in a bullish zone, attracting investor attention for May as it seeks to sustain its gains. Notably, TON’s recent upward momentum can be attributed to the increasing popularity of the Telegram game community token, Notcoin (NOT).
The integration of Notcoin into top crypto exchanges like Binance has bolstered its visibility among crypto investors.
Toncoin may continue to rally as May progresses, fueled by growing interest in the Notcoin listing. Many platforms require investors to stake their TON tokens to acquire Notcoin.
At the time of reporting, Toncoin was trading at $6.69, marking a nearly 17% increase over the past seven days.

However, it’s essential to note that these highlighted cryptocurrencies remain susceptible to overall market sentiment despite these positive fundamentals.

Gensler Devil (GENDEV) to Surge 8,000% After Solana Launch, Looks to Challenge Shiba Inu and Dogecoin



                    

Gensler Devil (GENDEV) could become a viral memecoin, like Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE).



Gensler Devil (GENDEV), a Solana memecoin that was launched today, is aiming to challenge other memecoin giants, such as Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE).




Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Gensler Devil presents a similar opportunity.



Gensler Devil has a market cap below $14,000 at the moment, meaning that when it just reaches a modest market cap of $200,000-$500,000, early investors would generate returns of 2,000%-5,000% in a matter of days or hours.



The exciting memecoin is poised to rally 5,300% in the coming two days, and Gensler Devil could potentially reach a multi-million dollar market cap within a few weeks.




Currently, Gensler Devil can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jupiter and Raydium, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days.



To buy Gensler Devil on these platforms, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Gensler Devil by entering its contract address – GwoY3GpqrSmws6QW88CyDaJkkTNfrQLGN2zZ1rSbJ6z9 – in the receiving field.



In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price.



If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner.




The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum.



This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like GENDEV.

FTX's Bear Refunds | Bankless


1️⃣ FTX's Bear Market Claim RecoveryIn an unexpected turn, claims from the FTX bankruptcy have surged above 100 cents on the dollar, according to a draft recovery plan estimating most creditors could see a recovery rate of 118%. In tandem, claim buying — where people’s claims are sold on secondary markets — continues to increase over concerns about tax implications and the ability to cash USD checks. As a result, FTX claims now trade between 101% and 112% — a seller’s market. Of course, these percentages still aren't making claimants jump for joy; remember claims have been sized against Bitcoin’s price as of Dec. 2022, when the asset was priced at around $16k ☠️2️⃣ Bitcoin Continues to StumbleDespite a solid start to the week, Bitcoin erased the gains that brought it to a high of $63.5K. Friday morning, It fell sharply to trade at~$60K following disappointing U.S. economic data, hawkish comments about inflation and monetary policy, and >$56M of liquidations in the previous 24 hours. The University of Michigan's Consumer Sentiment Survey, indicating a drop in consumer confidence, did not help. Next Wednesday, May 15th, April’s Consumer Price Index data will be released, most likely impacting Bitcoin’s price — hopefully to the upside. 3️⃣ Trump's Crypto Embrace, Biden's VetoCrypto found a spotlight moment in the Presidential campaign, this time with Trump. During the former president’s NFT trading card event, he stated he was “fine with crypto” — sending TREMP on Solana and TRUMP on Ethereum soaring 187% and 43%, respectively, over the next 24 hours. Trump's comments offered a stark contrast to President Biden's recent action of a veto on legislation easing capital requirements for banks handling crypto. This stance by Trump has ignited discussions within crypto, where many see his potential re-election as a positive shift for the industry.4️⃣ Nigeria Detaining Binance ExecThis week, Binance CEO Richard Teng called for the release of Tigran Gambaryan, a Binance executive detained in Nigeria for over two months. In a statement, he explained that Gambaryan was one of two detained executives, though the other executive managed to escape the country. The detentions occurred during a regulatory discussion, sparking international concern about the treatment of foreign business representatives. Additionally, the Nigerian government's recent decision to ban crypto trading in the local currency, which they believe harms the Naira, has increased tensions. Added to this are claims from Binance of ransom requests from Nigeria, alleging they asked for $150M in crypto for the release of Gambaryan.5️⃣ Robinhood Hit with Wells NoticeThe SEC's weaponization of Wells Notices continues; this week, they hit Robinhood over its crypto division. In response, Dan Gallagher, Robinhood's Chief Legal, Compliance, and Corporate Affairs Officer, expressed disappointment over the SEC's approach, emphasizing the company's position that the listed assets do not classify as securities. Gallagher also stated that the company had met with the SEC over a dozen times to try to register as a Special Assets Broker, although the SEC did not reciprocate the efforts and cut the process short. This latest announcement follows other Wells Notices sent to Uniswap and MetaMask over the past few months.

Dogecoin’s ‘golden cross’ could spark a 100% price rally for DOGE


Dogecoin (DOGE), the leading meme cryptocurrency by market capitalization, is signaling a possible bullish trend with the emergence of a “golden cross” pattern in its technical charts.
This pattern previously foreshadowed a significant price rally in early 2021. Currently priced at $0.1438, DOGE has declined by 4.70% over the past day but has shown robust year-to-date (YTD) growth of 60.32%, significantly outpacing Bitcoin (BTC), which has seen a YTD increase of 43.565%.
The 50-week simple moving average (SMA) of Dogecoin’s spot price is trending upwards and is projected to surpass the 200-week SMA soon, potentially forming a “golden cross”.


This bullish technical pattern, which hasn’t occurred since early 2021, previously preceded a significant price rally where Dogecoin soared to its all-time high of over $0.73, following a nearly 8,000% increase.
A golden cross suggests that new buyers are gaining ground more quickly than long-term holders, marking a potential shift from a bearish to a bullish market phase.

The path to this upcoming golden cross began when Dogecoin broke above its 200-week SMA in March with a dramatic 70% price increase in just one week, revitalizing the long-term moving average. This forthcoming golden cross would be the first in over three years.
However, the last golden cross in 2021 led to significant volatility, resulting in a massive surge followed by a 90% decline, with prices eventually stabilizing between $0.05 and $0.10 from May 2022 to February 2024. 
This highlights the volatile nature of cryptocurrency investments, especially in meme tokens like DOGE, which are highly susceptible to market sentiment and speculative trading.
Current market conditions and analyst perspectives 
Unlike the favorable macroeconomic conditions of 2021, today’s financial environment presents higher interest rates and increased geopolitical tensions, which might affect speculative investments differently.

Renowned crypto analyst, World Of Charts, suggests that despite these challenges, Dogecoin is approaching a critical descending trendline, with a potential breakout that could trigger a 100% surge in its price, aiming for a target of approximately $0.29.
This optimistic forecast aligns with momentum traders who regard moving average crossovers as pivotal indicators. As Dogecoin’s 50-week SMA continues to rise, it signals potential opportunities for those seeking short-term gains.
While the impending golden cross offers a hopeful outlook for Dogecoin, the volatile history following such events advises caution. 
Investors are advised not to rely solely on technical indicators but to also consider the broader economic conditions and personal risk tolerance. A balanced investment strategy is crucial, acknowledging both the potential upsides and downsides. 
Dogecoin’s journey toward another golden cross could indeed ‘kick-off’ another 100% rally, as suggested by World Of Charts. 
However, given the speculative nature of the market, participants should approach with caution, keeping in mind that past performance is not indicative of future results.

Introducing DAO Staking Pool v2: Enhanced Features and Migration Guide 🚀 - zkSwap Finance


                




We’re thrilled to announce the launch of DAO Staking Pool v2, an upgrade that brings significant improvements and added flexibility to our staking platform. Here’s a closer look at what’s new and how you can seamlessly migrate to this enhanced version.



Round 1 Datetime: Monday, May 13th, 2024, 14:00 UTC – Thursday, May 16th, 2024, 14:00 UTC.Who: Current yZF HoldersWhere: https://zkswap.finance/earn/staking



✨ Notes:



1. There will be 5 migration rounds, each lasting 3 days. There will be a one-day interval between rounds to prepare for the next round.



2. After Round 1, the ZF rewards for the current DAO Staking Pool (v1) will cease, and the new DAO Staking Pool (v2) will receive these rewards (5% max supply of ZF over 3 years). DAO Staking Pool (v2) still maintain a 1% unstaking fee distributed to other stakers in the new pool.



3. Users who stake yZF (v1) into the migration pool will receive the new yZF auto airdropped to their wallet within a maximum of 6 hours after the migration pool ends.



4. During the migration period, your Boost will remain the same as if you still hold your yZF, thanks to the temporary myZFi1 token. However, you won’t be able to swap with zero fee using Paymaster until you receive the new yZF.



✨ What’s New in DAO Staking Pool v2:



1. Flexible Unstake Fee Allocation: One of the key enhancements in DAO Staking Pool v2 is the introduction of a more flexible policy regarding the unstake fee. While DAO v1 implemented a fixed 1% unstake fee distributed to other stakers, v2 allows for this fee to be allocated to various destinations such as other stakers, a burn address, or the treasury.



2. Burning Mechanisms: The flexibility in the unstake fee allocation opens up possibilities for implementing burning mechanisms for our native $ZF token, enhancing its utility and value.



3. Precise Unstake Fee Setting: Unlike its predecessor, DAO Staking Pool v2 enables the setting of unstake fees with greater precision, allowing for percentages with more digits. For example, users can now set an unstake fee of 0.12345%, providing finer control over fee structures.



4. Enhanced User Experience: With DAO Staking Pool v2, users gain visibility into both their original staking amount of ZF tokens and their earnings. This transparency improves the staking experience, empowering users with a clearer understanding of their investment performance.



5. Heightened Security: While DAO Staking Pool v1 was already secure, v2 raises the bar even further, ensuring that your assets are safeguarded with the highest standards of security protocols.



✨ How to Migrate to DAO Staking Pool v2:



We’ve made the migration process as smooth as possible, offering two options for users:



Option 1: Users can migrate to DAO Staking Pool v2 without paying the 1% unstake fee.



1. Stake current yZF (v1) into the Migration Pool.2. Wait a maximum of 6 hours after the pool ends.3. New yZF (v2) will be auto airdropped to your wallet.



The following outlines the reality of what will happen, encompassing both team and user activities:1. Stake your current yZF (v1) tokens into the migration pool and receive an equivalent amount of myZFi1 tokens (1:1 ratio), which serve as temporary placeholders during the migration period.2. At the end of the migration period (typically 3 days), our team will withdraw the yZF tokens staked by users from the Migration Pool.3. We’ll swiftly set the penalty fee for the DAO Staking Pool v1 to 0.4. Exchange yZF for ZF tokens (unstake) from the DAO Staking Pool v1.5. Deposit ZF tokens into the new DAO Staking Pool v2 and receive the equivalent new YZF (v2) tokens.6. Airdrop the new yZF (v2) tokens back to users based on the amount of myZFi1 tokens they possess.



Option 2: Alternatively, users can1. Unstake from DAO Staking Pool v1 themselves, paying the 1% unstake fee.2. Stake into DAO Staking Pool v2.



Don’t miss out on the enhanced features and benefits of DAO Staking Pool v2. We recommend choosing Option 1 and joining us in this exciting new phase of the DAO Staking Pool. Happy staking!🌟

Justin Sun Received Millions of Dollars in Airdrops from This Altcoin - Here's the Hard-to-Believe Number - Bitcoin Sistemi


An interesting development took place in one of the wallets of Tron founder Justin Sun, one of the most controversial figures in the cryptocurrency world.
2.08 million EIGEN tokens were airdropped to the “Justin Sun 4” wallet, one of the wallets tagged as belonging to Justin Sun, minutes ago today.


According to the data, Justin Sun was the second wallet that staked the most Ethereum on EigenLayer. Sun staked 104,000 ETH directly to EigenLayer and 58,000 ETH through Puffer before March.

However, in the current situation, although the EIGEN tokens in question have been airdropped, their transferability feature has not been opened yet. However, on some pre-launch markets, EIGEN tokens are trading at $7.84 at the time of writing. This shows that Justin Sun was paid approximately $16 million thanks to his stakes. Sun had staked a total of $470 million of ETH to EigenLayer.





Officials said that these tokens will become transferable at a date to be determined later. The Eigen Foundation said in a Telegram message that they are targeting September 30.

Win 100 $SAND From The Sandbox Featured Experiences of the Week | Cryptopolitan

The Sandbox is offering players a chance to win 100 $SAND everyday by participating in one of its four featured experiences of the week: Shadowscape, Octodefense, RapidRumble, and Cyclades.The Sandbox Experiences of the WeekIn case you’re not aware, The Sandbox Game Maker lets creators develop and share unique experiences with other players without the need to write any code. Let’s take a look at what each of these experiences offer.1. Shadowscape Shadowscape in The Sandbox (Source: Shadowscape Experience)The concept of this 2-10 players experience is simple. You have to stay in the light in order to stay alive. You can use lanterns to carry the light, and build campfires with it. Also, you can also help your friends by sharing the torchlights, and build paths using plans. However, what adds excitement to it is that the torches burn out fast. Hence, you need to be fast and creative to survive.2. OctoDefenseOctoDefense in The Sandbox (Source: OctoDefense Experience)OctoDefense is reminiscent of classic tower defense games, where you shoot down enemies to prevent them from reaching the tower. The concept here is somewhat similar. You’re defending zombies from reaching the center, from 8 different directions – hence the term “OctoDefense”.You can shoot projectiles to stop them from reaching the center using the number keys from 1 to 8. However, if the zombies reach the center, you’ll lose 1 life and 2 points. And once you’re out of lives, you lose the game.3. Rapid RumbleRapid Rumble in The Sandbox (Source: Rabid Rumble Experience)Rapid Rumble in The Sandbox simply requires you to be among the fastest and most agile people in the Metaverse. It pits you against other players in a competitive racing environment with 1 – 10 players. All you need to do is run, jump, and clear the obstacles as fast as you can.4. Cyclades In Cyclades, you set about a fast-paced scavenger hunt and gather gems featuring pop culture icons like deadmau5, Paris Hilton, Rabbids, and of course, Snoop Dogg, while facing exciting challenges and twists along the way. The goal is to collect these gems as fast as possible, as you’re racing against the time and other fellow collectors.

Pepe Doge Will Rally 7,600% After Solana Launch, Looks to Challenge Shiba Inu and Dogecoin



                    

Pepe Doge (PEPEDOGE) could become a viral memecoin, like Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE).



Pepe Doge (PEPEDOGE), a Solana memecoin that was launched today, is aiming to challenge other memecoin giants, such as Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE).




Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Pepe Doge presents a similar opportunity.



Pepe Doge has market cap below $15,000 at the moment, meaning that when it just reaches a modest market cap of $200,000-$500,000, early investors would generate returns of 2,000%-5,000% in a matter of days or hours.



The exciting memecoin is poised to rally 7,600% in the coming two days, and Pepe Doge could potentially reach a multi-million dollar market cap within a few weeks.




Currently, Pepe Doge can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jupiter and Raydium, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days.



To buy Pepe Doge on these platforms, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Pepe Doge by entering its contract address – 7s7VZhFWTez5ykSr214AxnqRTMdcKu5rd77YFAx2DGG1 – in the receiving field.



In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price.



If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner.




The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum.



This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like PEPEDOGE.

Dogecoin price prediction: Is DOGE at risk of falling below $0.128? - AMBCrypto



Dogecoin was down by more than 7% in the last seven days. 
Technical indicators and metrics looked pretty bearish. 

Dogecoin [DOGE] bears stepped up their game as the world’s largest meme coin’s daily chart turned red.
 Concerns for the meme coin were far from over, as a bearish pattern emerged on its price chart, which could cause trouble in the near future. 
Dogecoin’s bearish move
According to CoinMarketCap, DOGE’s price had dropped by more than 7% in the last week. In fact, in the last 24 hours alone, the meme coin’s price declined by 5.5%. 
At the time of writing, the meme coin was trading at $0.1433 with a market capitalization of over $20.6 billion. While the price dropped, it continued to move in a bearish pattern.
 AMBCrypto’s look at DOGE’s chart revealed a bearish descending triangle pattern.
Source: TradingView
DOGE’s price entered this pattern in April and had tried to break above the upper trendline a couple of times.
 Unfortunately, it got rejected, which increased the chances of a southward bearish breakout if its price drops below $0.128. A few of the metrics also supported this outcome. 
For instance, DOGE’s velocity had dropped, meaning that the meme coin was used less often in transactions within a set timeframe. Its MVRV ratio was also in the negative zone. 
Additionally, DOGE did not witness an influx of new investors of late as its total amount of holders’ chart remained flat. 
Source: Santiment
DOGE’s Social Dominance plummeted last week, suggesting a drop in its popularity. Moreover, bearish sentiment remained dominant in the market, which was evident from its low Weighted Sentiment.

Dogecoin price prediction 
To see whether a bearish breakout is inevitable, AMBCrypto analyzed DOGE’s market indicators. We found that DOGE’s price remained under its 20-day Simple Moving Average (SMA), as per the Bollinger Bands.
 Its Relative Strength Index (RSI) was resting under the neutral mark at press time. The meme coin’s Chaikin Money Flow (CMF) also registered a downtick, further hinting at a continued price decline. 
Source: TradingView
AMBCrypto then checked Hyblock Capital’s data to find out whether there were any other support levels before $0.128 from which DOGE could rebound. 
Our analysis found that DOGE had strong supports near $0.143 and $0.139 marks. 

Read Dogecoin’s [DOGE] Price Prediction 2024-2025 

Going further south, DOGE also has support near $0.13. If the coin manages to change the trend after hitting any of these levels, then its value might touch $0.146 soon.
 However, if a bearish breakout takes place under $0.128, then Dogecoin might shed the majority of its March gains.

How is the US Inflation Situation Doing, Which is Critical for Cryptocurrencies? - Bitcoin Sistemi

Consumer confidence in the United States has taken a hit as inflation expectations rise despite strong economic indicators, according to a survey released Friday.
The University of Michigan Consumer Survey revealed that the sentiment index for May recorded a significant decline, falling from 77.2 in April to 67.4. This figure falls short of the Dow Jones consensus estimate of 76, indicating a 12.7% monthly decline. But it still represents a 14.2% year-over-year increase.


In addition to the pessimistic sentiment measure, inflation expectations rose for both one- and five-year periods. The one-year outlook rose 0.3 points from a month ago to 3.5%, reaching its highest level since November. Similarly, the five-year outlook rose slightly by 0.1 points to 3.1%, reversing the downward trend in recent months and reaching the highest level in November.
Survey director Joanne Hsu noted that consumers now acknowledge negative trends on several fronts. “They expressed concerns that inflation, unemployment and interest rates may move in a negative direction next year,” Hsu said.





Other indexes in the survey also reported significant declines: The current conditions index fell more than 10 points to 68.8, while the expectations measure fell 9.5 points to 66.5. Although both indexes were higher than a year ago, they were down more than 12% on a monthly basis.
This report comes amid a strong stock market rally and fuel prices falling slightly, though still at high levels. Although jobless claims last week reached their highest level since late August, most labor market indicators remain strong.


Paul Ashworth, Chief North American Economist at Capital Economics, expressed concern about the significant decline in confidence. “The magnitude of the decline in confidence is significant and cannot be satisfactorily explained by geopolitical factors or the stock market sell-off in mid-April,” Ashworth wrote.

Inflation data pose a significant challenge for policymakers as the Fed considers the near-term path of monetary policy. Jeffrey Roach, Chief Economist at LPL Financial, warned: “Uncertainty about inflation could weigh on consumer spending in the coming months. The Fed is on a difficult path to balance both its price stability and growth mandates.”





FED officials said at their meeting last week that they needed “more confidence” that inflation was “sustainably” returning to their 2% target before cutting interest rates. Policymakers see expectations as key to containing inflation, and the outlook from the Michigan survey has risen in consecutive months after falling significantly between November and March of this year.
Market pricing points to a strong expectation that the Fed will begin reducing the key borrowing rate in September, which it has held at its highest level in more than 20 years since July 2023. However, the outlook varies, although FED Chairman Jerome Powell stated in the post-meeting press conference that the central bank's next move will not be an interest rate increase.
The next important data point for inflation will come on Wednesday when the U.S. Labor Department releases its April consumer price index report. Most Wall Street economists expect the report to show a slight moderation in price pressures, but the widely followed CPI index was running at 3.5% annually in March, well above the Fed's target.

Ethereum Competitor NEAR Protocol Looks ‘Extremely Bullish,’ Says Analyst Jamie Coutts - Here Are His Targets - The Daily Hodl


								Real Vision crypto analyst Jamie Coutts says that key indicators for one Ethereum (ETH) competitor are flashing bullish.
The former Bloomberg analyst tells his 14,100 followers on the social media platform X that NEAR Protocol (NEAR) could soar more than 47% from its current value.










“Absolute price momentum: has been consolidating since March. The technical pattern looks extremely bullish if it breaks this resistance around $7.60 which is where a cluster of volume has traded these past months. This is a high conviction set up if it breaks the pattern neckline, producing a target above $10.50 (+30%).”
Source: Jamie Coutts/X
Looking at his chart, the analyst suggests NEAR is printing an inverse head and shoulders pattern (I-HNS). An I-HNS is a bullish technical formation with the right shoulder suggesting bulls are willing to accumulate the asset without waiting for the price to drop to its previous low.
The analyst also predicts that NEAR’s bullish trend against Bitcoin (NEAR/BTC) and Solana (NEAR/SOL) will continue.
“Relative price momentum: NEAR versus SOL and BTC are positive and ready to break higher.”
Source: Jamie Coutts/X
According to the analyst, NEAR is also experiencing huge daily active user (DAU) growth on the network compared to other smart contract platforms, which is another bullish signal.
“Absolute active user momentum: NEAR’s Daily active users have grown from 50,000 to 1.76 million in the past year. Ex-NEAR that number has grown from 5.4 million to 8.75 million.”
Source: Jamie Coutts/X
He says the user growth rate far exceeds the combined growth rate of the other layer-1 and layer-2 projects.
“Relative active user momentum: that’s growth of 33x vs 0.6x for the rest of the L1/L2 ecosystem.”
Source: Jamie Coutts/X
NEAR is trading for $7.14 at time of writing, down 3.6% in the last 24 hours.

Dashboard | Bankless



Dear Bankless Nation, The most technologically-savvy analytical tools in traditional industries has its limits.Why? For the simple reason that data is proprietary.Whether it’s a dataset from a Wall Street quarterly report, or data you extracted from Facebook — it’s data the company wants to reveal.That puts a ceiling on how in-depth the analysis can get.But in web3, virtually all of the data is publicly viewable.On-chain sleuthing is an actual thing anyone can do.Evidence?Every time there’s industry drama, dozens of anonymous analysts on Crypto Twitter leaping ahead of each other to offer their post-mortem.And you can too.Today, William shows us 5 must-have web3 analytical tools you can use to upgrade your game today.- Bankless teamEthereum and other top smart contract blockchains are teeming with data.If you can parse that data well in real-time, there’s plenty of alpha — and even job opportunities — to unlock.Accordingly, this Bankless tactic will walk you through the best resources you can use to level up your crypto analytics skills.Goal: Learn about top crypto analytics toolsSkill: BeginnerEffort: 1 hour to get startedROI: Knowing the best ways to “read” blockchainsA “blockchain data flow” output I created with Stable DiffusionWhy crypto analytics?I first discovered crypto in the spring of 2017.I studied as much about the space as I could that summer, and then that fall I landed my first gig in the field.It was a crypto news writing job at a small-time outlet, CryptoAnalyst.The catch? I still didn’t know much about crypto, and the blockchain analytics sector was very primitive and sparse at the time.I’ve stuck around the ecosystem ever since, and over the past few years one thing has particularly stuck out to me, which is how crypto analytics plays have surged, both in quantity and quality, in recent times.That’s good news for all of us, because knowledge is power.Or rather in crypto, knowledge is power and money.That maxim was as true in 2017 during the ICO ERC20 token boom as it is today in 2022 amid the Cambrian explosion of DeFi and NFTs.But again, one of the biggest differences between then and now has been the surge in quality contemporary crypto analytics tools that have made it exponentially easier to come by actionable web3 knowledge.Interested in making the most of these advancements and leveling up your crypto research game like never before? Then it’s time to double down on the best analytics tools around.Let’s explore 5 platforms you can use to step up your crypto research today. ⬇️⬇️⬇️⬇️⬇️Via CoinGeckoA few years back, it seemed like everyone used CoinMarketCap to check crypto prices, market caps, volume, etc.Then Binance acquired CoinMarketCap in April 2022, which many felt the platform had been “captured.”The community started looking for alternatives. The platform that saw the most success in recent years has been CoinGecko, who quietly out-built its competitor during the bear market, and is now currently the world’s largest independent crypto data aggregator.What I like most about CoinGecko besides its independence is that it feels like the platform is always ahead of the curve.Whenever I want to check the price action or trade volume of some new obscure coin, CoinGecko seems to always have the basic data on that token ahead of everyone else.Part of the reason for this impressive responsiveness?CoinGecko’s reach is downright massive — the platform currently tracks key stats for over 13,000 different crypto assets across over 600 crypto exchanges!Via GeckoTerminalSo if you’re looking to track crypto trends in real-time for the biggest projects and for categories like New Coins and Big Gainers & Losers, CoinGecko is as solid as solid gets.But that’s not all — the project’s also recently launched GeckoTerminal.GeckoTerminal is a DEX aggregator.Remember how I said CoinGecko’s reach is massive?The same is true for GeckoTerminal — if there’s a token you want to trade, whether it’s on an Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) chain or a non-EVM chain, GeckoTerminal likely has the charts and the pools you’re looking to directly analyze!Via DeFiLlamaAs a DeFi power user, DeFiLlama is a treat to use.Why?Because DeFiLlama accurately and quickly tracks total value locked (TVL) data and volume data across +150 chains and tons of different protocols, meaning the platform is a fantastic way to “see the cryptoeconomy from above” at any given time, so to speak.However, DeFiLlama is so much more than a plain DeFi stats hub.The project also provides real-time yield metrics, stablecoin charts, liquidation activities, airdrop opportunities, hack info, and beyond.In other words once you go ‘Llama, you never go back’. 🦙

Over the past couple of weeks, Reddit NFTs have popped off.Yet a few weeks ago I didn’t know anything about them at all!When I saw activity around these digital collectibles starting to surge, I knew I needed to write a Metaversal post to explain the basics of what was going on, so I did.Where’d did I go to catch myself up before teaching others?The answer is Dune Analytics.Dune Analytics is a platform that lets anyone create crypto analytics dashboards anyone else can review using SQL.For example, I researched my Reddit NFTs post mentioned above using an analytics dashboard created by Dune user petertherock, and it covered everything I needed, like number of NFT holders, sales volume, and more.The cool thing about Dune is that it covers these sorts of stats for DeFi and NFT projects alike across a variety of chains, like Ethereum, Arbitrum, Optimism, Polygon, and beyond.I recommend Dune as an important part of any on-chain analysts info diet accordingly.

If someone gave me a challenge to make $1 million in the cryptoeconomy in one year’s time with the stipulation that I only use one tool, that tool would be Nansen.That $1M mark is an arbitrary number in a hypothetical example, but the results Nansen can help you achieve are very real.I noted as much in one of my June 2022 Metaversal posts, Free-to-Mint NFTs, where I detailed a personal anecdote of how I used Nansen’s Mint Master tracker to mint WAGDIE NFTs before their floor prices initially exploded.At the time, I said:“I found WAGDIE via Mint Master by noticing on Friday that nearly 40 ‘Smart Minters’ had participated in the project’s mint. I was then able to accumulate a few before the project exploded, and now the floor price at the time of this post’s writing is 1.5 ETH each, so my subscription’s been covered multiple times over at this point.Of course, it’s not that every mint will be a win, but Nansen makes it simpler to surface signals in real time.”Via NansenThat’s still true today.It won’t lead you to constant wins, but it will help you surface notable “1 in 100” or “1 in 1,000” plays in real-time in ways that other projects can’t.For instance, Nansen provides the following awesome services:Wallet Profiler — metrics on any wallet addressHot Contracts — a dashboard for tracking trending smart contractsDeFi Paradise — a complete overview of the DeFi economyNFT Paradise — a complete marketview of the NFT economy, including trending collections and new mintsSmart Money — a dashboard for tracking the activities of prolific crypto and NFT tradersToken God Mode — a one-stop search engine for all the main info around a token, e.g. volume, transactions activity, etc.Via Token TerminalToken Terminal is one of my favorite crypto analytics platforms because it arguably has the best fee and revenue stats around for both blockchains and protocols.Want to know just how profitable a given crypto project is at any given time?Token Terminal has you covered, whether you’re researching projects across a certain vertical — e.g. lending markets — or across entire chains.Becoming A Better Crypto AnalystIf you learn how to navigate the 5 crypto analytics projects listed above, you will become a better crypto analyst than most everyone else right now.The good news is that these platforms make navigating key blockchain data simple, so it doesn’t take a particularly specialized knowledge base to get adept at them.Explore and use the projects, and who knows?You might just start pulling out on-chain victories that you didn’t know were previously possible!Action steps🔭 Check out the best crypto analytics tools:  CoinGecko + GeckoTerminal  DeFiLlama  Dune Analytics  Nansen  Token Terminal

Crypto's Red Relapse | Bankless


Trending down. Crypto assets shook the downturn and managed to eke out a green candle last week, but are at risk of relapsing into the all too familiar red pattern that has afflicted price since April. What happened this week in markets, and where is the outsized upside? With BTC yet again pressed against the bottom of its local range and funding rates remaining at relatively healthy levels, bulls can get comfortable entries here if markets are to maintain their uptrend, but should remain cognizant that a break of $60k support will extend the downside.Source: TradingViewWhile gains made by the total crypto market lagged behind those of BTC last week, Bitcoin dominance fell slightly this week, which can clearly be observed through strength from a smattering alts amid the broader down week.Two of the leading projects enabling decentralized compute sharing, Akash and Render Network, managed to decouple themselves from Nvidia’s performance this week, ranking among the best performing coins despite relatively flat performance from the AI heavyweight.Additionally, The Open Network (TON), a blockchain originally created by popular messaging application Telegram, was a top performer, rallying over 22% off crypto fund Pantera’s May 8 announcement that it had made the token its largest investment ever.
Unfortunately for Ethereans, their chosen asset sat out on the altcoin rally this week, with the token not only plunging over 10% from its weekly high in dollar terms but also losing relative strength in the ETH/BTC ratio.News that ARK Invest had removed staking from its pending spot ETH ETF application – a feature not considered in the approval process for spot BTC ETFs and one whose inclusion could derail an application’s approval – caused the odds of approval to surge to 18% on Polymarket.Although some traders interpreted the move as an indication that approval for non-staking applications may be imminent, it seems participants in more liquid markets continue to brace for denial, considering the relatively unchanged nature of the ETH/BTC ratio following the news and the continued slide of the pair ahead of the SEC’s first final decision deadline on May 23.

Even if this weekend's solar storm destroyed civilization, Bitcoin would survive

The sun can produce massive flares of particles and radiation that can have a significant impact on Earth. Scientists have studied these flares for 150 years, focusing on what’s considered the largest such event of all time: the Carrington Event of 1859, named after British astronomer Richard Carrington.The sun erupted and pumped enough energy into our planet’s magnetic field to ignite a massive geomagnetic storm and auroral display. Telegraph lines burst into flames, and the event was reported globally. Back then, electronic systems were not the center of daily life. Today, a Carrington-sized event could completely alter the complexion of daily life.Mississippi State University professor David Wallace wrote on Astronomy.com the potential ramifications could be disastrous:“It is only a matter of time before Earth is hit by another geomagnetic storm. A Carrington Event-size storm would be extremely damaging to the electrical and communication systems worldwide with outages lasting into the weeks. If the storm is the size of the Miyake Event, the results would be catastrophic for the world with potential outages lasting months if not longer.”That time could be this weekend. A huge solar storm is barrelling into Earth, bringing the threat of possible disruptions to satellites and power grids. As the world faces a “severe” geomagnetic storm, according to NOAA’s Space Weather Prediction Center, infrastructure operators are on edge due to the possible fallout of the solar event, which has significant implications for the crypto industry.As the first of six solar waves hit, the Earth was already experiencing a G4 electromagnetic storm–the highest in 19 years. The present storm affecting electronics, etc. would not be entirely unprecedented, as geomagnetic storms rated as “extreme” led to blackouts in Sweden and damaged power transformers in South Africa in October 2003.Scientists warn that these events happen at higher frequencies than believed and could be catastrophic. For instance, tree rings studied by scientists revealed two solar solid proton events that happened in 7176 and 5259 BCE, which were not previously known.Solar storms of increasing frequency have implications for the electronics on which crypto depends. Geomagnetic storms can disrupt satellite communications and power grids. Solar flares and coronal mass ejections (CMEs) could damage computer hardware. These sudden bursts of energy can release radiation across the electromagnetic spectrum, including X-rays and ultraviolet light.The high-energy particles induce electric currents in the components of a computer, possibly causing damage or data corruption. The Central processing unit (CPU), random access memory (RAM), and hard disk drives are most at risk due to their electromagnetic interference, possibly causing them to malfunction or fail altogether. Electromagnetic radiation can disrupt the communication between hardware components, leading to system crashes or errors.At the very least, disturbances can cause crypto exchanges and wallet downtime. Even a little bit of downtime could lead to significant financial losses for market participants. Multi-signature wallets and strict authentication protocols can also protect companies against disruptions caused by space weather.With that said, sufficiently decentralized blockchains–like the Bitcoin blockchain–would persist.Bitcoin has been broadcast over radio and MESH networks, though the use of its blockchain would be very slow. Even Lightning payments have been sent over the radio.CMEs would, in the worst-case scenario, take out electronics on the side of the planet facing the sun at the time of the explosion. That part of the planet, however, would face some serious setbacks. Power lines, consumer electronics, and medical devices would all be rendered useless.Solar storms with the potential to disrupt life on Earth make a great case for a decentralized financial system. A blockchain would carry on with blocks being produced and transactions validated by all the nodes that happened to be on the dark side of the earth when the solar storm hit.Crypto’s decentralized nature would prove superior to the mainstream banking system’s centralized structure. The internet was designed in a distributed fashion with enough redundancy so as to survive a nuclear attack. Bitcoin, for instance, has thousands of Bitcoin nodes, which means it’s actually more likely to survive a catastrophic event than a financial system based on centralized data servers. If even one node survives, the entire system can be reconstituted from that seed.

JPMorgan’s Onyx to industrialize blockchain PoCs from Project Guardian

Wall Street giants are looking at how to industrialize proofs-of-concept developed within the blockchain experiment Project Guardian. According to Stephanie Lok, product manager of JPMorgan’s blockchain platform Onyx, one of the company’s “very big focus area” is turning the learnings of the pilot program with the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) into products. Lok shared these details during the TokenizeThis event in Miami on May 10:“We want to see how we can take it forward. Investment fund tokenization is where we’re really focusing a lot of our time. [...] That’s a very big focus area: how can we kind of productionize, industrialize what we built out as a proof-of-concept?”Another traditional firm “really focusing on the blockchain-enabled finance migration” is the asset manager WisdomTree. Speaking at the event, Maredith Hannon, head of business development for WisdomTree, said the company is targeting portfolio personalization in addition to blending portfolios with checking accounts. “Think about if you could do 10,001 different variations of different types of allocations, different types of risk profiles,” said Hannon about the potential benefits of real-world asset tokenization for investors’ portfolios. Related: Tokenization to unlock interoperability across payments, investmentsTokenizeThis 2024. Source: Sam Bourgi/CointelegraphAlso tied to tokenization, WisdomTree is exploring how to offer different on-chain services under the same interface for its clients. According to Hannon, the bank is working on an application that will integrate a range of financial services, including tokenized portfolios and regular banking services. Hannon noted:“It’s just enabling those to be on-chain. Deliver that end value of being able to use your money more effectively. Being able to be in the market, in a money market fund earning 5% versus earning pretty much nothing in your checking account. That’s really the ethos that we’re going after here. And we think that from a distribution perspective, that’s a huge need in the market and a problem to solve.”WisdomTree is one of the asset managers behind Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETF). The Project Guardian is an initiative that explores the feasibility of decentralized finance (DeFi) applications and asset tokenization in wholesale funding markets. Launched in May 2022, its primary focus is on developing open and interoperable networks, institutional-grade DeFi protocols, asset tokenization, and trusted infrastructure. Project Guardian’s main participants include JPMorgan, DBS Bank, SBI Digital Asset Holdings, and WisdomTree. Magazine: Memecoins: Betrayal of crypto’s ideals… or its true purpose?

Crypto Hiring: Monad is using its $225M haul to load up on talent - Blockworks


A month ago, Monad raised $225 million on the promise of a high-throughput Ethereum-compatible layer-1 blockchain. It’s now putting those funds to use on the hiring front.
Kevin Canlas announced he joined the protocol as a senior designer. Canlas has previous experience in similar roles at the NFT collection Isekai Meta and smart contract security firm Cyfrin. 
At Monad, Canlas will be “leading internal designs and helping startups build on the Monad ecosystem,” he said on X.

Also this week, SungMo Park joined Monad as its APAC lead and head of Korea. Park previously served as head of business for Asia Pacific and for Korea during a nearly two year stint at Polygon Labs.
Park also becomes Monad’s first hire in the APAC region, he said on X.

Monad isn’t done hiring yet either. Charlie Noyes, of lead Monad investor Paradigm, advertised an open role for a senior crypto economics researcher at the protocol. Monad currently lists twelve job openings in total, mostly in its engineering department. 
Mini-Q&A: What crypto firms are looking for
Blockworks spoke with Stephen Moskowitz, founder and managing partner of Web3 recruiting firm Pyxis, about his recent observations on the crypto labor market. 
Keep reading for excerpts from Blockworks’ interview with Moskowitz, edited for brevity and clarity.
_________________________________________________________________________________________
Blockworks: What sorts of roles are most in-demand at the moment?
Moskowitz: Almost every single company in crypto right now is trying to hire either a head of marketing or a [chief marketing officer], and there’s a huge supply-demand imbalance there. There’s just a lack of crypto-native marketing talent. 
What I am seeing happen is that there’s a lot of title inflation in crypto, so people can go out with a head of marketing title, and they end up hiring someone that is coming from maybe a marketing manager or marketing lead type of role, or maybe they’ve got a couple of years of experience, and those people also might be more crypto-native, like someone coming out of school who spent a couple years in marketing. 
I think that those people are gonna be the next crop that kind of rises up as opposed to very senior Web2 people moving into Web3. Maybe at the CMO level that might happen if they don’t need someone quite as native, but if they want somebody who’s tweeting and more like an [individual contributor]-level role, I think that it’s gonna have to be the junior talent that steps up into these more senior titles because there just aren’t enough of these people that exist. 
Other notable hiring news

Wyatt Lonergan, the head of Circle Ventures, departed the firm.
Polygon Labs head of DeFi Jack Melnick announced he’s left the company.
Elisha Aswani left a growth role at Binance.
