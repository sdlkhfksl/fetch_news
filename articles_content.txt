Rwandan central bank proceeds with ambitious retail CBDC project

The National Bank of Rwanda (BNR) has opened up its just completed feasibility study on a retail central bank digital currency (CBDC) to public comment. The BNR is considering a national digital currency that incorporates the latest innovations in the technology and is highly tailored to local conditions.A retail CBDC would advance Rwanda’s cashless economy national initiative and increase the resilience of the financial system, which is still subject to frequent power outages, the BNR found. The central bank expects to spend $35 million on printing and maintaining its cash supply in the next five years, despite its cashless goal. The BNR is proposing an interest-free, intermediated CBDC with interoperability with all the country’s existing payment systems and potentially other CBDCs. after the appropriate amendments to the country’s Central Bank Act are made. It recommended a token-based, rather than account-based, model with open programmability and smart contracts.Tokenization would allow digital cash to be transferred offline using Bluetooth or Near Field Communication (NFC) technology and would not require a smartphone. This is in contrast to current electronic payment options.Programmability would be a mixed blessing, the study noted:“The advantages of open programmability, which facilitates value-added innovative products and services, are expected to outweigh the arguments of privacy and security.” The BNR foresaw no more than “partial pseudo-anonymity” for the CBDC. Related: BIS issues comprehensive paper on offline CBDC paymentsPayment service providers currently make up less than 0.9% of the Rwandan financial sector. The sector is challenged by low financial literacy, high remittance costs and a large informal economy, among other things. The BNR noted that reducing the amount of cash in circulation could formalize more of the economy.The study recommended the imposition of user fees and holding limits, without sorting out details. Public acceptance of a CBDC was also left an open question.Source: Central Bank of RwandaThe BNR favored a distributed database model over a distributed ledger for increased reliability. Its analysis used the World Economic Forum’s CBDC Policy-Maker Toolkit.Tokenized wholesale CBDC projects have been undertaken by Mastercard and Ripple, as well as the European Central Bank and the Bank for International Settlements’ new Project Agora. Tokenization in a retail CBDC may be an innovation. Offline CBDC transfers is also a subject of current research.

Revolut Expands Offering To 40 Million Users, Introduces Crypto Exchange Services | Bitcoinist.com


								In a significant move into the digital asset space, British banking app Revolut has unveiled Revolut X, a dedicated crypto trading platform for UK retail customers. 
According to a Fortune Magazine report, the launch of the new platform signifies Revolut’s commitment to the crypto industry and positions the company to compete with major players like Coinbase and Binance. 
Revolut Continues Crypto Push With New Platform
Interestingly, with a user base of over 40 million, Revolut is one of the world’s largest fintech companies. The new platform will reportedly enable traders to buy and sell over 100 tokens, with fees ranging from zero to 0.09%. 
This announcement follows the launch of Revolut Ramp in March. Through a partnership with MetaMask, Revolut Ramp allows investors to purchase crypto directly within their wallets.

Leonid Bashlykov, the head of crypto exchange products at Revolut, emphasized the company’s goal of empowering customers to grow their wealth, whether in fiat or crypto. 
The profitability of the UK-based fintech company has been closely associated with the crypto market. During the previous bull run, the company achieved profitability for the first time in 2021. The high margins of crypto trading are expected to contribute significantly to Revolut’s profitability in the future.
Contrasting Retreat From US Market
Revolut’s foray into the UK crypto market coincides with recent regulations introduced by the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA), the country’s regulatory agency. 
These regulations include mandatory “24-hour cooling-off” periods that require investors to wait a full day before completing crypto transactions. While these barriers present challenges for smaller or offshore companies, they are manageable for established players like Revolut, according to Boaz Sobrado, a London fintech analyst. Sobrado explained:
These barriers to entry are unsurmountable for smaller or offshore companies, but achievable for companies like Revolut and Kraken. This means there are less competitors around, and hence a larger opportunity.
The firm’s renewed focus on crypto also reflects the positive outlook of the broader market. Since the approval of 11 spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) in the US on January 11, which have accumulated over $53 billion in assets, Bitcoin’s price has risen by over 40%. 
Moreover, the entry of financial giants like BlackRock and Fidelity into the crypto space has accelerated market growth by expanding access to a broader pool of investors compared to previous cycles.

It is worth noting that the launch of the crypto exchange services in the UK contrasts with the company’s retreat from the US market. 
In August 2023, Revolut discontinued its crypto trading services for US customers, citing an unclear regulatory landscape and uncertain market conditions. However, this decision only affected a small portion, approximately 1%, of its user base.

Ethena's Bullish Pump | Bankless


Exchange Integrations. Many crypto tokens are finding themselves in the red, but Ethena’s ENA has managed to defy the trend, up nearly 10% to start the week! What is causing ENA’s outperformance, and is the catalyst sustainable? The ENA/BTC pair established its local bottom this Sunday, the same day Ethena’s Head of Growth tweeted this upcoming week would be big.Traders front-running the announcement sent ENA rallying against both BTC and the dollar throughout Monday before the token ripped higher early Tuesday morning to hit $1 for the first time in May on the news that its USDe synthetic dollar will be integrated with Bybit, the fourth-largest exchange by futures trading volumes in the month of April.
The partnership will enable spot USDe trading pairs and allow Bybit users to post USDe as perpetuals trading collateral, enabling them to access greater capital efficiency by offsetting a large portion of their funding payments. Additionally, users will be able to supercharge yields by supplying USDe to Bybit earn products.Should Bybit’s implementation of USDe prove to be a differentiating competitive advantage for traders, it is likely that additional exchanges will embed the synthetic dollar within their own products, providing massive tailwinds for USDe adoption and positioning it to finally compete in the big kids pool with USDT and USDC.
For Ethena to succeed, the demand for long leverage must remain high to keep funding rates elevated, as this is the source from which the Project generates the majority of its yield. Alternatively, compression in funding rates decreases the returns holders can earn, and Ethena incurs a loss when rates go negative.While high bull market-driven funding rates were supportive for USDe adoption in early 2024, the token’s supply has been down-only since April 13 when crypto markets slipped into a downtrend.Continued compression in funding rate markets is beginning to suggest that the mania is over for the moment, and although USDe exchange integrations can help bolster demand for the token, they will be unable to save the product should returns drift further downwards.Will BTC Follow TradFi Gains? on BanklessBTC could be headed for new ATHs if it can build off of TradFi’s rally.

The FCC’s Net Neutrality Ruling Is Good News for Web3 Startups

This principle has made possible a long list of home-grown internet applications that live at the endpoints and run on the network. Many, like YouTube and Netflix, or Zoom and Facetime, are core components of American (and global) social and work life. Without net neutrality regulations, network providers could have stopped Zoom or Facetime from ever coming into being, favor their own services over any potential new entrants, and pick and choose who they compete with, if you can even call that competition.

                        Football superstar Christiano Ronaldo was denied on May 4 his motion to dismiss a $1 billion class action lawsuit concerning his promotion of non-fungible tokens (NFTs) on Binance.According to Newsweek, Judge Roy Altman issued his ruling, stating, “We deny without prejudice the Defendant’s 29 motion to dismiss.”
Ronaldo Stuck With $1 Billion Lawsuit
“Accordingly, we direct the Clerk of Court to close and stay this case until we have adjudicated the pending motions to compel arbitration in the related action,” the judge added. Arbitration is a private form of dispute resolution in which a final decision on the case is left to a neutral, mutually accepted third party rather than going to court.Investors sued Ronaldo in November 2023, one year after the athlete launched an NFT collection called “CR7” in November 2022 in collaboration with Binance.The collection’s name represents Ronaldo’s Initials and shirt number, which he often uses to brand his products. It features digital collectibles of himself and moments from his sports career and purports to stand for “innovation, artistry, and the unparalleled thrill of fan engagement,” according to Binance’s website.Prosecutors alleged last year that his promotion of those NFTs was “deceptive and unlawful,” however, leading them to costly and unsafe investment decisions. Since early 2022, Ethereum-based NFT mints and trading volume have dropped alongside floor prices.
Ronaldo’s Promotions For Binance
Some of Ronaldo’s promotional activities included posts on his Instagram account, including one in March where he played foosball with another athlete sponsored by the exchange.“Had an amazing time with @binance, creating the next level of fan experience,” he wrote in January. “Thanks to my ForeverCR7 NFT collection, I got to meet and train with the holders of my rarest NFTs.”In the November lawsuit, plaintiffs asserted that Binance had only reached the heights of its “fraud” thanks to its sale of unregistered securities, which was enabled and bolstered by numerous celebrities like Ronaldo. Binance is currently fighting U.S. regulators in court as to whether the NFTs and tokens on its platform constitute investment contracts under U.S. securities law.Plaintiffs argued that Ronaldo’s promotional efforts sent Google searches for the keyword “Binance” up 500% upon his announcement of his partnership with the exchange. His premium NFTs sold out within one week of launch.

SHIB Scores New Listing, Prompting 5% Surge in Fresh Wallets - DailyCoin


        
The Swiss-headquartered institutional crypto exchange Nexo listed Shiba Inu.



Nexo’s representatives recognized SHIB as a symbol of communal strength.



SHIB’s new registered wallets grow further, totaling 1.31M active addresses.
Shiba Inu (SHIB) received a substantial adoption boost on May 7, as institutional crypto heavyweight Nexo affirmed the meme coin’s listing on their all-in-one platform. 
Nexo, the renowned digital assets institution, posted a backstory of the iconic Shiba Inu mascot and SHIB’s emergence over the years. Back in 2021, CEO Antoni Trenchev labeled SHIB an “inside joke,” elaborating that “as it goes viral, the number of people in on the joke can go into millions, pushing the valuations out of this universe.”Since then, SHIB’s status has improved, bringing a new set of features directed at the growing Shiba Inu community, popularly known as the SHIB Army. In recent years, SHIB developers launched the Layer-2 blockchain Shibarium, a digital identity mechanism slated to introduce the community to Top-Level Domains (TLDs) and other perks.SHIB’s Bullish Wave Picked Up by New HoldersAs Nexo mentioned in their introductory tweet, Shiba Inu’s decentralized crypto exchange (DEX) ShibaSwap was the first step in providing real utility to the Shiba Inu community.Shiba Inu’s collectible card game Shiba Eternity quickly topped other popular games like Uno and Solitaire on the App Store and Google Play during their initial release in 2022. Alongside a base of dedicated veteran supporters, SHIB is enjoying a renaissance in new wallets, according to the latest on-chain data by IntoTheBlock.With a 5.07% hike in newly registered wallets and a 6.15% upswing in active crypto wallets, SHIB’s price performance since last week has also borne fruit in 6.6% gains. However, the upward trajectory depends on various macroeconomic factors, Shiba Inu burning efforts, and new projects being brought onto Shibarium’s Layer-2 chain.On the Flipside
An evolving feud between community members on X has sparked controversy among the SHIB Army. Shibburn’s official burn tracker’s official X handle posted allegations that Shytoshi Kusama and the developer team have “no control or say in the SHIB token,” even though both parties agree that SHIB is decentralized.
Why This MattersShiba Inu’s popularity has grown over the years to the point that SHIB Army is arguably the largest meme coin community in the cryptosphere.

Ethereum Is No Longer ‘Ultrasound Money’ After Dencun Upgrade: Analysts - Decrypt

We do the research, you get the alpha!Get exclusive reports and access to key insights on airdrops, NFTs, and more! Subscribe now to Alpha Reports and up your game!Go to Alpha ReportsEthereum’s latest upgrade may have worked a bit too well, bringing unwelcome consequences for long-term Ethereum (ETH) investors.As advertised, the Dencun hard fork slashed transaction fees by over 90% on multiple Ethereum layer-2 networks shortly after going live on March 13. the median Ethereum transaction fee today is up to four times lower than before Dencun when comparing periods of similar network activity, according to market intelligence platform CryptoQuant.With users paying less in fees, however, the Ethereum network is now burning the circulating ETH supply at its slowest rate since the Merge in September 2022. In fact, the burn rate is now so low that ETH has returned to being an inflationary currency, regularly issuing more units than are burned in a given period.“We conclude that, at the current rate of network activity, Ethereum will not be deflationary again, and the narrative of ‘ultrasound’ money has probably died or would need much higher network activity to come back to life,” CryptoQuant analysts in a weekly research report on Wednesday.“Ultrasound money” became a popular nickname for Ethereum after the Merge, which changed the consensus mechanism for the second largest cryptocurrency by market cap from proof of work to proof of stake. The upgrade also cut the issuance rate of new ETH by 90%, bringing it below the amount that the network burned through fees.Ethereum faithful eagerly used that fact to needle Bitcoiners, who have proudly championed Bitcoin (BTC) as “sound money” thanks to its fixed supply of 21 million coins. Theoretically, Ether was now superior “ultrasound money” with an actively decreasing supply, making it a better long-term store of value.But with ETH’s inflation rate back above zero, that argument is gone—and a revival in network activity may still fail to bring it back. As CryptoQuant noted, fees burned on Ethereum were positively correlated with network activity up until Dencun, after which they fell like a rock.According to the open-source dashboard ultrasound.money, Ether’s current inflation rate is 0.559% per year—still higher than Bitcoin’s 0.835% rate following last month’s halving.Edited by Ryan Ozawa.Stay on top of crypto news, get daily updates in your inbox.

Grayscale's Ether Futures ETF Application Pulled, Reason Not Disclosed


																A proposal to list and trade shares of prominent asset manager Grayscale’s Ether futures exchange-traded fund (ETF) has been withdrawn, as per a new document filed on Tuesday.
The filing by the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) revealed that the application for the Grayscale Ethereum Futures Trust ETF, filed by NYSE Arca, Inc. in September last year, was withdrawn on May 3.
Previously, the agency had delayed consideration of Grayscale’s ether futures ETF, with the most recent postponement occurring in March.
However, the SEC had approved a batch of ether futures ETFs in October 2023, including those from ProShares, VanEck, and Bitwise.
Bloomberg ETF analyst James Seyffart was the first to point out the development. Initially, Seyffart believed that Grayscale had a strategic plan to use its ether futures ETF to influence the securities regulator into approving its spot ETH ETF.




He found it puzzling that Grayscale withdrew its application, particularly with the SEC scheduled to decide on at least one spot ether ETF application on May 23, just over two weeks away.
Seyffart, along with fellow analyst Eric Balchunas, had previously estimated a 25% chance of approval for spot ether ETFs in May, a decrease from 70% in January.
Even with Grayscale’s withdrawal, Seyffart now sees the company as having no alternatives if the SEC doesn’t approve its spot ether ETF.
“If you don’t want to piss off the SEC. Withdrawing and re-filing is less work for the SEC. But at same time it means there’s no way for Grayscale or anyone to sue now.”
However, comments from SEC Chair Gary Gensler in a May 7 CNBC interview suggest that the SEC is still deliberating on spot Ether ETF applications.

White Pepe (WHPEPE) Will Surge 6,900% as MEXC Listing Announced, While Shiba Inu and Dogecoin Struggle



                    

White Pepe (WHPEPE) could turn early investors into multi-millionaires if it becomes a mainstream coin, like Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE).



White Pepe (WHPEPE), a new Solana memecoin that was launched this week, is poised to explode over 6,900% in price in the coming days.




This is because WHPEPE has announced its first centralized exchange listing, which will be on MEXC.



This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up.



Currently, White Pepe can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jupiter and Raydium, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days.




Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and White Pepe could become the next viral memecoin.



To buy White Pepe on Raydium or Jupiter ahead of the MEXC listing, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for White Pepe by entering its contract address – 58kSp6Sn8P42EdRDgud75YcvkRLnCpMxPb7MqCRHkUeG – in the receiving field.



In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price.



If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner.




The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum.



This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like WHPEPE.

UK's FCA Seeks Balanced Crypto Regulation by Merging TradFi and DeFi Approaches



                    

The UK’s Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) aims to strike a balance in regulating cryptocurrencies by merging the best elements of traditional finance (TradFi) and decentralized finance (DeFi). 



This approach is to ensure neither over-regulation nor under-regulation disrupts the growing crypto market. 




Matthew Long, the FCA’s director of payments and digital assets, emphasizes the necessity of this strategy for effective regulation during his speech at the FT Crypto and Digital Assets Summit on May 8.



Long stated, “What we’re trying to do is take the best of traditional finance and understand the nuance of the system that we’ve got.” 



He elaborates that the regulatory framework should mirror the existing structures in traditional finance but adapt to the unique challenges of cryptocurrencies. 




This includes recognizing the global nature of the crypto market which necessitates a responsive regulatory approach.



“The simplest and most straightforward answer is that they [FCA] are trying to take the best of traditional finance, so it’s the same risk, same regulation and not reinvent the wheel,” Long noted, adding: “But we must and we absolutely must respond to the differences in cross border globalization otherwise. So to be frank, it’s a bit of both.”

During his discussion, Long pointed out that some regulatory aspects previously considered straightforward by the FCA turned out to be complex, and vice versa, indicating a learning curve in adapting regulatory measures to crypto-specific issues.




Moreover, Long highlighted the existence of risks in both centralized (CeFi) and decentralized finance sectors, stressing that tools for combating issues like money laundering in CeFi could be tailored for the crypto environment. 



This is part of a broader FCA initiative to foster a “cleaner, safer, and better” crypto market.



The UK’s increasing involvement in the cryptocurrency space is evidenced by the FCA’s recent activities. Since 2020, the authority has approved 38 out of 300 applications from crypto firms, reflecting its proactive stance in regulating the sector. 



Additionally, the FCA has enhanced its capabilities in monitoring and preventing market abuse and illegal crypto advertising. 



This underscores the UK’s commitment to establishing a regulated yet thriving crypto economy.

And the SEC didn't consult with the banking regulators about it, Flood pointed out, arguing that Gensler "doesn't have any business in the banking world."

Cryptocurrency Billionaire Andrei Grachev Rumored to Buy This Altcoin - Bitcoin Sistemi


Andrei Grachev, founder and CEO of controversial market-making firm DWF Labs, may be about to buy a hefty chunk of the altcoin, according to information provided by cryptocurrency data provider Spot on Chain.
According to the data, 0x3a2, a cryptocurrency wallet that previously sold Prom (PROM) to Grachev, purchased another 112 thousand PROM, equivalent to $1.12 million, through Binance. According to the data, this purchase was made at an average price of $9.95.


According to Spot on Chain, this wallet was previously used to purchase 52,900 PROMs via Binance in December 2023, paying a total of 257 thousand dollars with an average price of $ 4.86. The 0x3a2 wallet then used the 0x3d1 wallet as an intermediary to sell the purchased PROM tokens to Grachev for 500 thousand USDT.

The trade in question took place in February this year and 49,965 PROM units were purchased by Grachev. At that time, with this purchase, the price of the token increased by approximately 75%.





At the time of writing this article, PROM price is trading at $9.81, with a 2.29% decrease in the last 24 hours.

President Biden says he would veto resolution countermanding SEC crypto rule

United States President Joe Biden’s office has issued a statement informing lawmakers and the public that his administration plans to veto a joint resolution affecting crypto policy at the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) if it comes to his desk.In a May 8 statement, the White House said it “strongly opposes” members of the House of Representatives seeking to pass a joint resolution it claims would disrupt the SEC’s efforts “to protect investors in crypto-asset markets and to safeguard the broader financial system.” H.J.Res. 109, introduced in the House in February, would overturn the SEC’s Staff Accounting Bulletin (SAB) No. 121, which requires banks to keep customers’ digital assets on its balance sheets, with capital maintained against them.“SAB 121 was issued in response to demonstrated technological, legal, and regulatory risks that have caused substantial losses to consumers,” said the Biden administration. “By virtue of invoking the Congressional Review Act, it could also inappropriately constrain the SEC’s ability to ensure appropriate guardrails and address future issues related to crypto-assets including financial stability. Limiting the SEC’s ability to maintain a comprehensive and effective financial regulatory framework for crypto-assets would introduce substantial financial instability and market uncertainty.”Source: White HouseDemocratic and Republican leaders from the House Financial Services Committee took to the House floor on May 8 to express their views on the resolution. Representative Patrick Henry, a Republican, urged lawmakers to support H.J.Res. 109, claiming that SAB 121 allowed the SEC “to dictate how financial institutions and firms safeguard Americans’ digital assets.”“If you want Americans to be able to engage with digital assets safely and securely, banks — which are some of the most regulated businesses in our country — are probably the best way,” said Representative McHenry.Related: Big banks are nudging the SEC for a slice of sweet Bitcoin ETF actionRepresentative Maxine Waters, a Democrat and ranking member of the House committee, opposed the joint resolution, claiming that the SEC accounting rule allowed for greater transparency in the digital asset space. She reiterated claims in the SEC guidance that the rule was intended to address “unique risks and uncertainties” associated with cryptocurrencies and called McHenry’s efforts “harmful” and “partisan.”“This kind of transparency helps prevent the kind of fraud and mishandling of crypto assets that led to the collapse of major crypto companies like FTX,” said Representative Waters. After consideration in the House in which H.J.Res. 109 appeared to pass by a voice vote, Representative McHenry called for a count of the yeas and nays. The House chair postponed proceedings on the resolution “until a time to be announced.” Under the U.S. Constitution, the House could override President Biden’s veto with a two-thirds majority vote. Magazine: US enforcement agencies are turning up the heat on crypto-related crime

11 Crypto ICOs That Can Mint Millionaires in Q3 2024



                    

The entire crypto community has anticipated the year 2024 for a long time. This anticipation resulted from perks attached to the year—Bull run, BTC halving, ICOs, etc.



Whenever the bull run starts, tons of novel projects kick, as they want to be a part of the ecosystem’s success. The majority of them launch their ICOs just so that they can onboard investors early, who will, in return, enjoy the benefits after the project launches.




These ICOs allow investors to buy a project token at a meager price compared to the launch price. After launch, some ICOs will enable investors to access all their funds. In contrast, others give a certain percentage upon launch, provide some months for cliffing, and then the remaining is shared in percentage over a period of months stated in their tokenomics.



Irrespective of the strategy used, the goal is to see all projects succeed. Nonetheless, as much as there are many good players, bad players also show forth their ugly heads. They present a false project, over-promise their investor to gather funds, and run away with the money overnight. This indicates that it is essential to research before jumping on any ICO to ensure investment is done at the right place.



In this article, we’ll consider the top 11 ICOs that can mint millionaires in Q3. From the product these projects offer to their roadmap and industry partnership, it has been established that these are vital factors to consider before making a decision.

Solana Slerf (SOLSLERF) Will Explode 9,000%, as it Looks to Challenge Shiba Inu and Dogecoin



                    

Solana Slerf (SOLSLERF) could become a viral memecoin, like Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE).



Solana Slerf (SOLSLERF), a Solana memecoin that was launched this week, is aiming to challenge other memecoin giants, such as Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE).




Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Solana Slerf presents a similar opportunity.



Solana Slerf has market cap below $10,000 at the moment, meaning that when it just reaches a modest market cap of $200,000-$500,000, early investors would generate returns of 2,000%-5,000% in a matter of days or hours.



The exciting memecoin is poised to rally 9,000% in the coming two days, and Solana Slerf could potentially reach a multi-million dollar market cap within a few weeks.




Currently, Solana Slerf can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jupiter and Raydium, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days.



To buy Solana Slerf on these platforms, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Solana Slerf by entering its contract address – D2R7sKwPNpWGtEfMJiLVe5G2ZJbExnk98PEft2dhyCrL – in the receiving field.



In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price.



If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner.




The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum.



This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like SOLSLERF.

Solana Surge: Here’s Why This Analyst Is Predicting A Rise To $360


                            Recently, a popular crypto trader and YouTuber has predicted a substantial surge in Solana price, forecasting it could reach as high as $360 soon.
This prediction is underpinned by a technical pattern on Solana’s chart—a bullish signal suggesting a potential reversal from bearish to bullish momentum.

Technical Insights Into SOL Potential $360 Rise
According to the trader, CryptoJack on X,  SOL has developed a “rounding bottom pattern” over an extended period, indicating it is on the brink of a significant breakout.
Notably, the ’rounding bottom’ pattern, characterized by a gradual decline followed by a stabilizing trend and an upward breakout, is a classic bullish indicator in technical analysis.
CryptoJack’s analysis points out that Solana is setting up for a significant uptick, aiming for a price target double its current value of approximately $146.

Not only does CryptoJack see a bright future for Solana, but other analysts, such as Altcoin Sherpa, also maintain a bullish stance, with projections of the token potentially surpassing $500 this year.
This would represent a 300% increase from its current level, adding to the 589% growth it has already achieved year-to-date.
Solana Challenges Ethereum
While Solana has shown notable growth, some of its key metrics are also beginning to keep up the pace. Dan Smith, a senior research analyst at Blockworks, suggests that Solana could soon surpass Ethereum regarding transaction fees and capture Maximal Extractable Value (MEV).
Smith’s analysis of X highlights that Solana’s total economic value is nearing Ethereum’s, indicating its increasing relevance in the blockchain space.

Despite this competition, Ethereum maintains a significant lead in daily transaction fees and total value locked (TVL). In the last 24 hours, Ethereum generated over $2.75 million in fees, compared to Solana’s $1.49 million.

Moreover, according to data from DeFillama, Ethereum’s TVL of over $53 billion dwarfs Solana’s $3.96 billion, representing just about 7.2% of Ethereum’s scale.

Meanwhile, Ethereum does not come close to Solana in terms of market performance. Solana has seen quite outstanding growth in the past year, surging by over 500%. On the other hand, Ethereum has only seen a 66% surge over the same period.

XRP Price To Reach $1.68? Here’s What Will Drive It | Bitcoinist.com


								Crypto analyst Jonathan Carter has predicted that the XRP price could rise to $1.68. The analyst, however, noted what needs to happen before the crypto token can attain such heights. 
How XRP Price Will Rise To $1.68
Carter noted in an X (formerly Twitter) post that the XRP price was “bouncing from the lower trendline of a symmetrical triangle on the weekly chart.” He claimed that a successful breakout above the triangle would signal a bullish outlook for the crypto token, with $0.93 and $1.68 mi-term targets if this happens.

Like the broader crypto market, XRP is also experiencing a downtrend, and Carter’s prediction undoubtedly offers hope that the crypto token will soon see a trend reversal. Crypto analyst XRP Captain also seems to hold this belief, as he recently shared an X post in which he stated that an XRP breakout was on the horizon.
Like Jonathan Carter, XRP Captain highlighted a symmetrical triangle on XRP’s chart. However, XRP Captain seemed to have a much higher price target for XRP, with the analyst hinting that XRP could rise above $2.6. Meanwhile, crypto analyst Jaydee agreed with this prediction and replied to XRP Captain’s post, stating, “It’s coming! Glad we loaded up heavily at 0.44 and 0.50! Zero emotions!”
Jaydee had earlier made a prediction of his own, stating that XRP will make “life-changing gains for the 5% (smart money) once we bounce off the 7-year trendline.” In the accompanying chart he shared, the analyst highlighted a hidden bullish divergence that had formed for the crypto token.
XRP’s Road To Double Digits
Crypto analyst Egrag Crypto recently predicted that the XRP price could rise to double digits soon. He claims that there is “a mini pump to $1.5 and major pump to $5.89 in the cards.” According to him, this macro pump could be so parabolic that it will cause XRP’s price to soar above double digits.

Analyzing the charts, Egrag noted two ways XRP’s parabolic rise could happen. He claims that if XRP’s price action follows the white triangle, the crypto token will break out to the upside, possibly rising to $1.5 during this rally. He added that this will begin a “significant macro breakout” that coincides around Fib 0.786.
Meanwhile, XRP moving along the blue triangle could propel the crypto token to $5.89, coinciding around Fib 1.618, Egrag remarked.
According to data from CoinMarketCap, XRP is trading at around $0.51 at the time of writing, down over 2% in the last 24 hours.

Tether Boosts Investment in Eastern Europe, Partners with Georgian Crypto Payment Provider CityPay.io



                    

Stablecoin powerhouse Tether is boosting its investments in Eastern Europe’s cryptocurrency scene through additional funding for the Georgia-based crypto payment provider CityPay.io. 



This development was formally announced on May 8, marking a significant step in CityPay.io’s growth and operational scale.




Tether’s investment into CityPay.io isn’t the company’s first; it follows a prior investment made in 2023 when Tether became one of the first stablecoin firms to back the payment platform. 



This platform enables users to use cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin to pay for services at various locations, including Wendy’s and Radisson Hotels.



The latest round of investment aims to enhance CityPay.io’s penetration into the Eastern European markets, with a particular focus on countries like Georgia, Armenia, Azerbaijan, Kazakhstan, and Uzbekistan. 



As of May 2024, CityPay.io has established over 600 service points in Georgia alone. 



The company has ambitious plans to broaden its services to include e-wallet and card solutions within the next two years and is aiming to set up more than 500,000 cryptocurrency payment points across the planned expansion areas.



“Our previous collaboration with CityPay.io yielded exciting results in expanding convenient cryptocurrency use across Georgia,” said Paolo Ardoino, CEO of Tether, emphasizing the positive outcomes of their initial partnership. 



He further stated, “With this second investment, we aim to build on those results and drive the adoption of cutting-edge technologies that disrupt traditional payment systems.”

CityPay.io also marked a significant step towards integrating Tether as a payment option on the Polygon network in October 2023. 




Additionally, meetings with governmental bodies in Georgia were conducted by CEO Ardoino in September 2023 to discuss expansion plans.



Moreover, Tether has been actively collaborating with the Georgian government since signing a memorandum of understanding in June 2023. 



This agreement focuses on developing Bitcoin and peer-to-peer payment infrastructures within Georgia, signaling a robust governmental support for cryptocurrency initiatives.



Georgia’s emergence as a crypto-friendly hub is evident with its welcoming of major cryptocurrency firms like Binance and hosting a significant number of Bitcoin ATMs. 



CoinATMRadar indicates that Tbilisi, the capital of Georgia, alone hosts 132 Bitcoin ATMs, highlighting the country’s advanced cryptocurrency infrastructure and its global aspirations in the digital finance arena.

Core Scientific sees revenue surge in 1Q24 after emerging from bankruptcy

Bitcoin miner firm Core Scientific posted improved financial results for the first quarter since emerging from bankruptcy. The company reported a total revenue of $179.3 million, marking an increase of $58.6 million over the same period in 2023.Net income for the quarter reached $210.7 million, an increase from the net loss of $0.4 million reported for the first quarter of 2023. This rise in net income was primarily driven by gains from obligations totaling $143.8 million and a decrease in Chapter 11 financing expenses, said the company.Revenue from digital asset mining reached $150 million, while hosting revenue contributed $29.3 million, according to Core Scientific. Digital asset mining revenue in excess of mining costs stood at $68.4 million, reflecting a 46% gross margin — compared to $25.4 million and a 26% gross margin in the same period of the previous year. The overall revenue from mining increased due to higher Bitcoin prices and Core’s mining capacity. According to the company, mining revenue was driven by a 134% increase in the price of Bitcoin and a 20% increase in the company’s self-mining hash rate, which offset a 34% reduction in the amount of Bitcoin received due to a 73% rise in the global hash rate.Hosting revenue in excess of hosting costs was $9.3 million, representing a 32% gross margin, compared to $6.4 million and a 28% gross margin in the first quarter of the previous year. The higher hosting revenue was primarily attributed to onboarding new digital asset mining clients, which drove a $6.7 million increase in hosting revenue. Operating expenses for the quarter totaled $16.9 million, down from $24.2 million in the same period last year. “We now believe our infrastructure is well positioned to take advantage of the enormous demand for power and infrastructure required for high-performance computing, and we see this as the next major growth opportunity for our business,” said Core Scientific’s CEO Adam Sullivan during an earnings call. During the fiscal first quarter of 2024, Core Scientific produced 2,825 self-mined Bitcoin, reportedly more than any other publicly listed miner in North America. The company owns approximately 745 megawatts of infrastructure that generated a total hash rate of 25.5 EH/s, comprising 19.3 EH/s from self-mining and 6.2 EH/s from hosting operations during the quarter.Core Scientific mined a total of 2,825 Bitcoin in 1Q24. Source: Core ScientificFollowing the Bitcoin halving event — which cuts miners’ revenue by half — Core is planning strategic mining equipment purchases at lower prices. According to Sullivan:“We are waiting to make countercyclical miner purchases to take advantage of improved pricing. After the recent halving, we are already seeing that dynamic take shape, with post-purchase pricing lower than pre-purchase.”Core Scientific received court approval to emerge from bankruptcy and relist its shares on the Nasdaq on Jan. 16, putting an end to a 13-month restructuring process.

US House of Representatives Meets to Abolish Important Crypto-Hostile Rule Critical to the Fate of Cryptocurrencies - Here are the Details - Bitcoin Sistemi

In a recent development, the US House of Representatives engaged in an hour-long debate on House Joint Resolution 109. The decision aims to rescind the Securities and Exchange Commission's (SEC) Accounting Bulletin Statement (SAB) 121, a rule with significant implications for the banking and cryptocurrency industries.
SAB 121 requires banks to disclose all cryptocurrency holdings, keep customer cryptocurrency assets on their balance sheets, and maintain an offset obligation. In other words, for every dollar of cryptocurrency held in escrow, the bank must hold an equivalent amount.


Originally adopted as guidance, SAB 121 was later adopted as a rule by the Government Accountability Office (GAO). This decision sparked controversy among banking regulators, including Federal Reserve Chairman Jay Powell, who has a different approach to crypto custody.
In response to GAO's decision, a Joint Resolution bill was introduced by Senator Cynthia Lummis, Representative Mike Flood, and Representative Wiley Nickel to repeal SAB 121.





Democrats, led by Maxine Waters, have advocated keeping the disclosure rules in SAB 121 but introducing a separate bill to change how cryptocurrency custody transactions work. They believe that repealing SAB 121 would weaken the SEC's authority and ability to issue new guidance on cryptocurrency in the future.

Maxine Waters announced that President Biden had conveyed his intention to veto the Joint Resolution if it reached his desk and emphasized the administration's commitment to keeping SAB 121 in place.


Despite opposition from the majority of Democrats on the House Financial Services Committee, Republicans argued that without changing the rule, the US risks smuggling cryptocurrencies overseas. They believe that decisions on such matters should be left not to the SEC, but to prudential banking regulators such as the FED, FDIC (Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation), and OCC (Office of the Comptroller of the Currency).
Representatives Flood and Nickel expressed concerns about the risk of centralization of Bitcoin, the asset that backs Bitcoin ETFs. They pointed out that large companies such as BlackRock, Fidelity and Bitwise cannot hold custody with banks, which leads to high centralization in Coinbase.





While the discussions continue, all eyes are on the vote to be held this weekend. While the resolution is likely to pass on a bipartisan basis in the House, it is expected to face challenges in the Senate. Moreover, the White House has signaled its intention to veto any attempt to overturn SAB 121.

With various cryptocurrencies exhibiting significant movements, Ethereum Classic, Tron and Kaspa have recently sparked investor interest due to their price action and recent developments, leading some analysts to tout them as the best crypto to buy now.
                        As blue-chip cryptocurrencies trade with a bearish bias on Wednesday, Bitcoin (BTC) is sliding back to $ 62,000 after it found resistance at its 50DMA earlier this week. With a stagnant market outlook for larger cap coins, traders are parsing through the altcoins markets to look for the best crypto to buy today that might deliver a quick upside.At current levels around $62,500, Bitcoin is down close to 5% from its Monday high of $65,500.The cryptocurrency is still up over 10% compared to last week’s lows, however.Short-term macro headwinds eased last week following weaker-than-expected US jobs data, easing fears about an overly hawkish Fed.Spot Bitcoin ETF inflows also returned, though they have since petered out once again.The near-term Bitcoin price outlook looks very much tilted to consolidation within recent ranges.With Fed rate cuts still some way off and ETF flows not providing much momentum, Bitcoin lacks short-term price narratives.Consolidation in the coming months would fit Bitcoin’s typical 4-6 months post-halving and summer seasonality.That said, Bitcoin’s long-term outlook is as strong as ever.The blockchain’s hash rate, or computing power, has strengthened four-fold since Bitcoin was at its current price level in 2021.If Bitcoin can nudge back above its 50DMA in the coming weeks, that could be a buy signal, according to an analysis by Bitcoin Archive, which calls it a “mega-bullish” occasion.With Bitcoin on course to challenge $100,000 this year or next, it’s potentially the best crypto to buy today.But for investors looking for a bigger upside than Bitcoin’s potential 2x, altcoins might be more attractive.Here are some of Wednesday’s top-performing altcoins that might be the best crypto to buy today.
Best Crypto to Buy TodayEthereum Classic (ETC)
Ethereum Classic (ETC), the token of the original, non-forked Ethereum blockchain, is outperforming its sister on Wednesday.It was last up 5% in 24 hours, as per CoinMarketCap, and trading near $28.ETC broke below its 2024 uptrend last month. But after briefly reaching as lows as $23, it is mounting a comeback.If it can break to the north of the $28-29 resistance area, where its 50DMA also resides, that could signal that the bulls have regained control.As hype and FOMO in the market build and investors become more irrational, ETC could reclaim these peaks, making it a good candidate for the best crypto to buy now. Source: TradingViewEthereum Classic is a highly speculative play. It doesn’t have a fraction of the adoption of Ethereum.

Crypto Alternatives to Consider
While the above coins offer the potential to return up to 5x this bull market, many investors will be hunting even stronger near-term gains.These investors can consider an alternative high-risk, high-reward investment strategy – getting involved in crypto presales.A presale is when an upcoming web3 protocol sells its native token at an early-bird discount to fund development.Presales are risky, as projects can fail to deliver. But if they deliver, the upside can be huge – 100x or more.If investors can reliably identify high-potential presales, they can make a great return.With so many presales vying for investor funds, knowing where to start can be daunting.That’s why the team at Cryptonews.com has compiled a list of what they deem to be the best crypto presales.See the 20 Crypto Presales

SEC Wants More Than Just a 'Slap On the Wrist' Against Ripple - Decrypt

The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission says that the penalty that Ripple is willing to pay after a long drawn out legal battle would be a “slap on the wrist that neither punishes nor deters” wrongdoing.The regulator argued in a Tuesday filing that its initial $2 billion demand would be more appropriate than the nearly $10 million fine Ripple proposed last month. The SEC said that Ripple’s offer would not deter other cryptocurrency businesses from violating Section 5 of the Securities Act, which requires issuers to file a registration statement when publicly offering securities.“Given the nearly $1 billion Ripple gained violating Section 5 [and] the multi-billion-dollar business it built selling XRP—accounting for the value of Ripple’s massive XRP holdings and its cash on hand—the ‘low’ penalty Ripple demands would be a ‘slap on the wrist’ that neither punishes nor deters,” the filing said. “To the contrary, it would encourage other crypto asset issuers to violate Section 5 by making it a remarkably lucrative endeavor, and thus deprive investors the disclosures Congress mandates, as a mere ‘cost of doing business,’” it continued.Ripple’s chief legal officer Stuart Alderoty on Tuesday slammed the regulator in a post on Twitter. “More of the same from the SEC—failing to faithfully apply the law and trying to pull the wool over the Judge’s eyes,” he wrote. Ripple—whose founders were behind the seventh biggest cryptocurrency XRP—has been locked in a legal battle with the SEC for years. Back in 2020, the regulator hit the fintech company with a $1.3 billion lawsuit, alleging that it sold unregistered securities in the form of XRP.But last year, Ripple scored a partial court win against the SEC when a judge ruled that programmatic sales of XRP to retail investors did not qualify as securities.The ruling sent shockwaves through the industry—particularly as Wall Street’s biggest regulator faces ongoing criticism from politicians and the crypto industry for cracking down unfairly on the digital asset industry. However, the judge also said that $728 million worth of contracts for institutional sales did constitute unregistered securities sales. The SEC is seeking a $2 billion fine for that violation as a result.Edited by Ryan Ozawa.Stay on top of crypto news, get daily updates in your inbox.

Nigeria claims Binance's bribery allegations are 'blackmail'

The Nigerian government has refuted bribery allegations made by crypto exchange Binance, which were described as baseless and an attempt to distract from the company’s legal challenges in the country, according to a press statement released on May 8.Binance CEO Richard Teng recently alleged that Nigerian officials demanded $150 million in crypto to settle an ongoing criminal investigation against the company.However, Rabiu Ibrahim, Special Assistant to the Minister of Information and National Orientation, dismissed the allegations as “diversionary tactics” and “blackmail.”Serious offensesThe Nigerian government said Binance is being probed for serious offenses, including money laundering, terrorism financing, and manipulating foreign exchange through illegal trading.It further highlighted that another Binance executive escaped custody and is now considered a fugitive with an international arrest warrant issued by Interpol.The government reiterated its commitment to following lawful processes and urged Binance to respect judicial proceedings rather than engaging in public relations maneuvers.The statement concluded by emphasizing that the Nigerian government will not succumb to any form of blackmail from any entity, whether local or foreign.Execs arrestedAmid the bribery allegations, Teng has also called attention to the detention of Tigran Gambaryan, a US citizen and Binance’s head of financial crime compliance, who was apprehended upon his arrival in Abuja on Feb. 26.Teng condemned Gambaryan’s detention as a tactic to control Binance, stating that the executive was in Nigeria as a “functional expert” rather than a negotiator or decision-maker.This controversy arises as Nigeria intensifies its regulatory measures against crypto trading to protect its currency, the Naira, from manipulation.Over recent months, the Nigerian government has directed telecommunications providers to restrict local crypto users’ access to trading platforms such as Binance and OctaFX. Additionally, authorities have accused the crypto exchange Binance of enabling trades worth billions, further exacerbating the strain on the Naira.The Nigerian Securities and Exchange Commission also recently announced plans to remove the Naira from peer-to-peer trading platforms as part of a broader crackdown on crypto trading, which has been blamed for adding volatility to the foreign exchange market.Mentioned in this article

                        As Shiba Inu (SHIB) threatens a bearish breakout of a key technical pattern, investors are moving their attention to a new ICO as they target 1000% returns that they are unlikely to get with SHIB.SHIB has formed a pennant structure in the past two months as it continued to consolidate below its 2024 highs.Though pennant structures can break in either a bullish or bearish direction, SHIB risks seem tilted towards fresh downside.That’s because SHIB has found strong resistance twice in the last few weeks at its 50DMA.That suggests that the bears remain in control of this market.If SHIB does break below its current pennant structure, as well as below its 100DMA, sell pressure could surge.The first bearish target would be the support zone at $0.000018. The next target would be the late 2024 highs and early 2023 highs in the $0.000015-16 area.Shiba Inu Investors Move to New ICO, Targeting 1000% Returns / Source: TradingViewWith SHIB likely to drop in the near term, investors are looking for alternatives that might offer quick upside.One new ICO called 5thScape has caught the attention of analysts at Cryptonews.
5thScape – Is This New ICO 2024’s Best Opportunity?
Exciting new ICO 5thScape has been generating a lot of hype recently.5thScape is a first-of-its-kind crypto-powered VR/AR project. The project is developing its own VR/AR headset and VR/AR ecosystem, the economics of which will be powered by the blockchain.And the exciting new ICO’s surging presale suggests investors are betting it will become a market leader. 5thScape has already raised north of $5.8 million.Its token 5SCAPE is currently priced at $0.00327, a steep discount from its planned launch price of $0.1. That means investors who get involved now can lock in potential gains of 200%.Given its total token supply of 5.21 billion, investors who get in now are essentially buying into the project at a market cap of $17 million.But if 5thScape starts to gain traction as a market leader, it could easily become a $100+ million market cap coin.To kick start its web3 push, 5thScape is busily building a VR MMA game called MMA Cage Conquest.There is every possibility that presale investors could lock in 1,000% gains.$5SCAPE token can be bought today with ETH, MATIC, USDT, BNB, or card.80% of the total token supply is available for purchase in the presale.Buy 5SCAPE HereHere’s why 5SCAPE is one of popular crypto presale analyst Clinix Crypto’s top picks for 2024.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p_GdTI2qdfA

Optimism will roll out new features to support layer 3 on Superchain - Crypto Briefing




Optimism is set to release two new features to facilitate the integration of layer 3 (L3) builders into its Superchain network. The upcoming features, custom gas tokens, and Plasma Mode, are designed to streamline the onboarding process for L3s utilizing the OP Stack and to foster a collaborative environment within the Optimism ecosystem.According to Optimism’s blog post, projects looking to build an L3 solution can use their existing layer 2 (L2) token for gas fees. Optimism expects this feature to simplify the transition for communities from L2 to L3 and reduce onboarding costs for new users.“- rather than needing to onramp by performing an expensive L1 transaction depositing gas tokens into the L2, on-ramping to an L3 can be as simple as performing a cheap L2 deposit transaction into the L3,” Optimism stated.The deployment of custom gas tokens is in the final stages and is expected to be available soon, the team noted.With Plasma Mode, Optimism wants to offer an alternative data availability (DA) layer option, which is essential for developers looking to launch cost-effective chains.By only requiring transactions to be submitted to L2 rather than the Ethereum Mainnet, the costs associated with data commitments and output roots are significantly reduced. This reduction in fixed overhead costs makes L3s a more accessible option for deployment on the OP Stack.“Low overhead costs give L3 teams an even more accessible option for deploying on the OP Stack.” Optimism added.The team claims that the recent launch of Redstone, the first OP Stack Chain with Plasma Mode, exemplifies the potential of this feature to enable high-throughput applications without the need for new programming languages. Optimism continues to develop Plasma Mode to integrate multiple DA layers and anticipates that L3s will extensively experiment with this feature.Optimism’s vision for Superchain is to create a chain network that shares an open-source tech stack and contributes revenue to the Optimism Collective. L3s are now invited to join this expanding network, with the promise of access to a broad network of builders, eligibility for various funding opportunities, and the ability to shape the future of scalability within the Superchain ecosystem.The latest developments are part of Optimism’s ongoing effort to meet the growing demand for flexible and customizable technology within the Optimism ecosystem. They also demonstrate the company’s commitment to making blockchain technology more accessible to a wider range of developers and consumers.“As the Optimism ecosystem grows, so does the demand for flexible, customizable tech. Scalability is about making blockchain technology more accessible to more builders and consumers. If developers can build scalable applications, they can reach more users without excessively increasing their costs or needing to multiply their resources,” Optimism stated.

Bitcoin Price Prediction as $1B Liquidity Fund Launched for Hong Kong Crypto ETFs - Will Asia Lead the Next Bull Market?


Bitcoin Price Prediction

Bitcoin’s pivot point is set at $62,500, which Bitcoin has recently undercut, suggesting a bearish bitcoin price prediction. Immediate support at $59,164 provides the next threshold that could see significant buying interest if tested. Further supports are placed at $56,677 and $54,336, levels that might come into play if the downtrend continues.
On the resistance side, Bitcoin faces several barriers. The immediate resistance is at $64,564, beyond which the next levels are $67,084 and $69,356. These figures represent critical points that Bitcoin would need to surpass to confirm any potential bullish reversal.
Bitcoin Price Prediction – Source: Tradingview
Technical indicators offer additional insights into Bitcoin’s market position. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) is currently at 63, indicating a slightly bullish momentum, although it’s nearing overbought territory.
The 50-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA), at approximately $62,585, aligns closely with the pivot point, reinforcing it as a significant resistance level. The EMA’s position above the current price suggests that we could see continued resistance around this area.
Conclusion: The current market setup for BTC/USD shows a bearish trend below the $62,500 pivot point. Should prices continue to hover below this mark, it might catalyze further drops towards the $59,164 support or lower. Conversely, a break above the pivot could signal a shift to a more bullish outlook, potentially driving prices towards higher resistance levels at $64,564 and beyond.

3 trends to think about before crypto's bull run resumes

Cryptocurrency’s next bull run has already begun. One of the most significant differences compared to past cycles lies in the type of new investors entering the market. Bitcoin (BTC) exchange-traded funds (ETFs) effectively opened the door for wider participation by making it easier to get a piece of the action, and Ethereum (ETH) ETFs are widely expected to arrive soon.Newcomers may have some difficulty understanding crypto, but there is a worthwhile framework to be considered in light of their first investments.Beginners often start by investing in the big names like Bitcoin and Ethereum. For the most part, you can invest in Bitcoin and wait at least six months before checking its price to see if it's grown enough to sell. But for those with only a few thousand dollars to invest, investing in Bitcoin isn’t going to make you a millionaire. The near to mid-term growth potential is 2-3 times its current value.Related: The Runes protocol will ignite a new season for Bitcoin after the halvingExperienced players understand that they need to check the latest trends. If done right, investing in a dozen small projects could really pay off. Assets that proved popular in the previous bull run, like new layer-1 protocols and lending platforms, might offer a chance to grow your investment by five to 10 times.However, risk and return are two sides of the same coin. How much one is willing to gain or lose in crypto really boils down to the time, resources, and energy one is ready to put into studying the market. That’s where the beauty of crypto lies: for those willing to learn, it's perfectly accessible.There are three narratives that the average new user without any impressive experience behind him comprehend and qualifiedly believe. The key is to figure out the story behind each product. Innovation stands at the forefront of this space because people in crypto are innovative and constantly looking for something new. I see three such trends for the bull run.Will Bitcoin really peak at the end of 2025? Source: XFirst is the marriage of artificial intelligence and blockchain technology. A large number of projects are now trying to innovate at the intersection of blockchain and AI. While it's not guaranteed that these efforts will have fruitful outcomes, the narrative itself is strong. This trend, riding the wave of both blockchain's potential and AI's cutting-edge advancements, could capture the imagination of investors and enthusiasts alike. I’m following RitualNet and Morpheus.The second trend delves into more fundamental aspects related to the tokenization of real assets or the tokenization of debt. In a traditional market, the debt market is larger than the stock market. Yet, in the crypto realm, there is currently no debt market. Stablecoin can be considered its starting point, since companies issue stablecoin in exchange for real dollars and then themselves buy short-term U.S. bonds. However, the concept of corporate debt remains untouched within crypto. Therefore, everything related to debt tokenization has enormous potential. PV01 and Ondo Finance are two projects in this area.Related: Solana illustrates the dark side of monolithic blockchainsThe third trend focuses on enhancing blockchain technology itself — improving its efficiency, increasing throughput, and lowering operational costs. It uses new tech like parallel Ethereum Virtual Machines (EVMs) to process many things at once, speeding up transactions. Likewise, zero-knowledge (ZK) proofs keep things private but simple, making the whole system work smoother and cost less. Sei and Monad are projects to watch in this area.But how can we use these narratives to delve into the product? Imagine an investor who studies a product. He is interested, maybe even excited about a project. Every time he encounters something incomprehensible in the document, he highlights it in red. Then he looks at the whole description and sees that there is too much red in the document: there is too much he does not understand about the product description. And he doesn't invest. This is a straightforward strategy: if an investment is too complex to understand, it might not be the right one. This approach emphasizes the need for clarity. So, when you're thinking about investing in a trend, remember that the big funds have probably already made a move. If there is some kind of noticeable narrative, then they will most likely have already invested in it. This is a good reminder to stay informed - understanding that, in the world of investment, it’s the giants who often lead the game.Ruslan Fakhrutdinov is the CEO and founder of X10, a self-custodial crypto exchange based in London.

FTX Pens Plan Promising 118% Cash Back to Creditors - DailyCoin


        
FTX has unearthed billions of dollars to pay back customers. 



The exchange’s bankruptcy estate has proposed a new Chapter plan. 



FTX claimants could receive more than what they are owed. 
FTX’s wild goose chase with its creditors is finally drawing to a close as the now-defunct crypto exchange appears more confident in filling SBF’s $10 billion hole. In a surprising and positive development for claimants, the exchange’s bankruptcy estate has now devised a plan that would pay creditors more than they’re owed– in cash.FTX Unearths Billions to Pay Back CustomersFailed crypto exchange FTX has found billions of dollars more than required to cover the losses users incurred during the SBF-led fiasco in November 2022. Surprisingly, the exchange is set to fully reimburse users plus interest—a rare sight in US bankruptcy proceedings. 
“In any bankruptcy, this is just an unbelievable result,” said FTX CEO John Ray.FTX’s newfound confidence stems from its recent efforts to liquidate assets, including its mountain loads of Solana, shares in successful startups like Anthropic, and its extensive list of illicitly acquired estates. With as much as $16.3 billion in cash at its disposal for distribution, 50% more than it owes, FTX appears well-equipped to settle its debts, totaling around $11 billion to two million customers and other creditors.The exchange’s bankruptcy estate is now confident in reimbursing 98% of its creditors for 118% in claims– in cash. FTX Proposes New Chapter 11 PlanOn Tuesday evening, FTX announced an amended Chapter 11 plan to pay claimants more than they’re owed. 
Announcing the new proposal, FTX’s CEO shared, “We are pleased to be in a position to propose a Chapter 11 plan that contemplates the return of 100% of bankruptcy claim amounts plus interest for non-governmental creditors.”Creditors with allowed claims below $50,000 will be eligible for the 118% compensation pending court approval, as outlined in the plan. According to a recent court filing, FTX’s proposal is slated to distribute the claims within 60 days of court approval.FTX’s new restructuring plan aims for a “centralized distribution” among its customers, regardless of where their assets are located. The plan also seeks to leave no crumbs for shareholders. Court documents detailed that although all debts will be paid in full, plus interest, nothing will be left for equity holders.This is primarily because US regulators and the IRS are bidding their time and waiting for FTX to repay its customers. Once the debts are cleared, regulators will likely wipe out shareholders’ claims.FTX’s major equity holders include Sequoia Capital, Thoma Bravo, Singapore’s Temasek Holdings Pte and the Ontario Teachers Pension Plan, according to a court filing last year. The defunct exchange’s resurgence comes on the heels of the crypto market’s rebound from the bear market.FTX’s Bittersweet Conundrum Bitcoin at press time hovered above $60,000, reaching a new all-time high earlier this year, while Solana, a significant part of FTX’s holdings, comfortably sits above $140 and has climbed up to the top five rankings as one of the year’s top performers.The market’s resurgence has been a boon for FTX, especially considering the uncertainty surrounding the bankruptcy estate’s ability to repay customers, with initial projections suggesting only a 90% reimbursement.While FTX appears now more confident, the market’s recent performance presents a dilemma. The total crypto market cap has surged by 210% since November 2022. However, FTX’s restructuring plan will compensate victims based on the cash value of digital assets held on the exchange on November 11, 2022, the date of the bankruptcy—ignoring the accumulated gains over the past two years. FTX customers could potentially miss out on billions in gains due to the structure of the Chapter 11 plan. Although many users have contested the proposal, arguing it was unfair due to the crypto market healing, FTX attorney Andy Dietderich asserted that US bankruptcy was ‘very clear,’ stating:"I have no wiggle room on that. The Bankruptcy Code says what it says, and I am obligated to follow it."Still, given the market volatility, it is a positive development that claimants are at least receiving compensation. The recent market conditions could not have been accurately predicted when the Chapter 11 plan was proposed.On the FlipsideWhy This MattersFTX’s collapse had a very lasting impact on the crypto landscape. However, the new plan signals a positive development for the industry and the affected users. It brings them closer to receiving the compensation they were owed, even though they were given little hope earlier last year.Will Cardano and Bitcoin Cash collaborate?Cardano’s Hoskinson Gauges Bitcoin Cash Integration With PollBTC-e founder bites the dust for laundering billions:BTC-e Founder Admits $9B Money Laundering Conspiracy Charge.

House votes to nullify SEC’s anti-crypto banking guidance SAB 121

The United States House of Representatives has voted to pass a bill that overturns controversial Securities and Exchange Commission guidance preventing banks from owning crypto. President Joe Biden, however, previously warned earlier in the day that he would veto the new bill if it were to make it to his desk. On May 8, the House voted to pass a bipartisan bill dubbed H.J. Res 109 which overturns the SEC’s Special Accounting Bulletin (SAB 121) that requires banks to hold their customers’ crypto assets on their balance sheets — which is not the case for traditional assets such as securities. Republican Congressman Mike Flood — the lawmaker who introduced the resolution — said SAB 121 was unfair for banks looking to custody crypto, as custodial assets are “always considered off-balance sheet."Notably, 21 Democrats voted in favor of the bill — which combined with the unanimous 207 votes from Republicans — saw the bill pass 228 votes to 182. Source: Caitlin Long/XDespite the bill being passed through the House of Representatives, President Joe Biden stated he will veto the new bill.In a May 8 statement, the White House said it “strongly opposes” members of the House of Representatives looking to overturn SAB 121, claiming it would disrupt the SEC’s efforts “to protect investors in crypto-asset markets and to safeguard the broader financial system.”Limiting the SEC’s ability to maintain a comprehensive and effective financial regulatory framework for crypto-assets would introduce substantial financial instability and market uncertainty.Source: White HouseIntroduced by the SEC in March 2022, SAB 121 outlines the regulator’s accounting guidelines for institutions looking to custody crypto assets. Notably, SAB 121 virtually prevents banks from custodying crypto assets on behalf of clients.U.S. lawmakers including SEC Commissioner Hester Peirce have argued SAB 121 jeopardizes the willingness of regulated banks to act as crypto custodians and treats crypto holdings differently than other assets."By overturning SAB 121, the bipartisan resolution ensures consumers are protected by removing roadblocks that prevent highly regulated financial institutions and firms from acting as custodians of digital assets," wrote the House Financial Services Committee (HSFC) in a May 8 statement. “Staff Accounting Bulletin 121 is one of the most glaring examples of the regulatory overreach that has defined Gary Gensler’s tenure at the SEC,” said HSFC Chairman Patrick McHenry.This is a developing story, and further information will be added as it becomes available.

AI Tokens Take The Baton From Memecoins To Lead A Market Resurgence ⋆ ZyCrypto

&nbsp

&nbsp
After last week’s bloodbath, cryptocurrency prices began climbing northwards again, this time on the backs of projects linked to artificial intelligence (AI).



The price resurgence sees AI-themed tokens record the largest gains over one week, with leading tokens easily racking double digits. AI-based RNDR spiked by over 40% on the seven-day charts to be the biggest gainer among the top 100 cryptocurrencies by market capitalization.



Placed side by side with other niches, other AI-themed tokens were no match for the broader market. Fetch.ai (FET) climbed by 23% in a week to erase previous losses, while Bittensor (TAO) and SingularityNet (AGIX) basked in double-digit gains as well.



For comparison, Bitcoin could only manage a sub-4% gain over the same period, while Ethereum (ETH) and Cardano (ADA) barely recorded gains of 1%.



A bird’ s-eye view of the broader financial markets offers some insights into the AI-backed resurgence of cryptocurrencies. Following the upcoming release of company financials, experts predict AI chip manufacturer Nvidia will post impressive results for Q1, with one analyst eyeing earnings of $5.49 per share.

“There is a strong buzz around Nvidia’s impending earnings,” said one analyst. “AI coins will keep having cyclical runs as they are directly correlated with the whole AI-side development happening around us.”



The AI ecosystem has been buzzing with activity since the tail end of 2022, accentuated by the launch of several AI models by leading industry players. OpenAI, Google, Microsoft, and Anthropic have emerged as frontrunners for the space while others are turning to blockchain for their AI offerings.



A cross-section of analysts expect the AI craze to continue for the foreseeable future, buoyed by the injection of fresh capital into the design and commercial rollout of powerful AI models.



“OpenAI will launch a new model in the coming months, better hardware will be developed, and more funds will be injected into the space,” said DYOR founder Hitesh Malviya. “We are in an AI super cycle right now.”



Memecoins may be running out of steam



In Q1, memecoins hogged the spotlight with impressive returns for investors but recent on-chain data points to a flippening. While Dogecoin (DOGE) appears headed to 20% gains over the course of a week, other memecoins have not had a rosy climb in recent days.



Shiba Inu (SHIB) is down nearly 4% over the last 24 hours while Pepe (PEPE) suffered a 6.19% slip in the same time frame. Solana-based dogwifhat (WIF) appears to be the biggest loser with losses cantering toward 12% over the last day with analysts opining that investors may be paying close attention to the utility of tokens.

Biden Vows to Kill Bill to Retract SEC Crypto Banking Policy - Decrypt

Just as the U.S. House of Representatives approved a resolution demanding that the Securities and Exchange Commission roll back its anti-crypto banking policies, the White House preemptively declared that it will be vetoed if passed.The resolution to overturn a 2022 SEC bulletin passed with bipartisan support, 228-182, on Wednesday, earning praise from crypto advocates within and outside Capitol Hill.”With the disapproval resolution, the House is taking a stand to ensure that such significant changes go through the proper public rulemaking process,” said Amanda Russo, director of communications of the Crypto Council for Innovation, in a statement shared with Decrypt. ”This is vital for maintaining a competitive and innovative financial landscape.”The impact of the vote was blunted, however, by a statement issued by the Biden administration hours before.“The administration strongly opposes passage of H.J. Res. 109, which would disrupt the SEC's work to protect investors in crypto-asset markets and to safeguard the broader financial system,” it read. “Limiting the SEC’s ability to maintain a comprehensive and effective financial regulatory framework for crypto-assets would introduce substantial financial instability and market uncertainty.”If the resolution made it to President Joe Biden's desk, the statement concluded, he would veto it.The focus of the dispute is a normally uncontroversial Staff Accounting Bulletin (SAB) issued in April 2022. “The obligations associated with these arrangements involve unique risks and uncertainties not present in arrangements to safeguard assets that are not crypto-assets, including technological, legal, and regulatory risks and uncertainties,” the bulletin read.“Traditionally, staff accounting bulletins are not designed to enact sweeping policy changes—they are meant to clarify existing rules,” Russo said. “SAB 121, however, acts as a new rule, impacting core aspects of the financial and digital asset industries.”Rep. Mike Flood (R-Nebraska) introduced a resolution in the House condemning SAB 121, while a companion resolution was introduced in the Senate.“It is unfortunate that the SEC would attempt to circumvent the rulemaking process while falsely claiming that SAB 121 is simply non-binding staff-level guidance,” Flood said on Monday.Longtime SEC critic Rep. Tom Emmer expressed strong support for the House resolution today.This resolution is an essential effort to protect consumers and foster innovation in digital assets markets,” he said. “It's also critical to stop the SEC's regulatory power grabs.”“SAB 121 introduces more unnecessary and avoidable concentration risk into the digital asset ecosystem, making our markets less fair, less orderly, and less efficient,” Emmer had said earlier this week, adding on Twitter that SEC chair Gary Gensler is violating his agency's statutory mission.Stay on top of crypto news, get daily updates in your inbox.

UK Moves to Regulate Staking and Stablecoins


The UK is on the brink of passing significant regulations concerning staking and stablecoins, aiming to cement its position as a global hub for cryptocurrency. 
This legislative push is being spearheaded by Economic Secretary Bim Afolami, who recently emphasized the urgency and priority of these regulations at the Financial Times Crypto and Digital Asset Summit.
UK’s Staking and Stablecoin Regulations 
Afolami expressed confidence in the government’s ability to implement the necessary legislation around these key areas of the crypto market. 

Stablecoins offer a semblance of stability that is not commonly found in the volatile crypto market. Additionally, staking provides a mechanism for cryptocurrency holders to earn rewards by participating in network operations. 

“What I’m very confident we’ll be able to achieve is the secondary legislation around staking and stablecoins. Those two things are absolute priorities in the coming weeks and months,” Afolami said.


The Conservative Party, currently holding the reins of the government, is keen on these regulatory advancements. Despite recent electoral setbacks where they witnessed seat losses to the Labour Party, the Conservatives are pushing forward with their crypto regulatory agenda.

Still, the political climate has uncertainties. The recent shift in local power dynamics could influence the legislative process, especially with the general elections looming. The need to act worsens due to these political pressures and the global financial impact on the UK’s regulatory stance.
As Afolami noted, the imminent regulations enhance market stability and provide clear, structured guidelines that could attract more business to the UK’s crypto sector. This move will reinforce and bolster investor confidence by ensuring a secure, transparent, and stable regulatory environment.

XRP on the Verge of Breakout? Analyst Points to Key Pattern to Suggest Surge of Over 200% | Cryptoglobe


                                
The price of XRP, the native token of the XRP Ledger, has been on a turbulent journey in recent years. After a meteoric rise to nearly $2 in April 2021, XRP has been in a slump, leaving investors questioning its potential for recovery as it’s now trading at $0.52 while BTC is at $62,000. However, a recent analysis by market analyst Jonathan Carter suggests that XRP might be on the cusp of a significant upswing.



The cryptocurrency strategist shared his analysis on the microblogging platform X (formerly known as Twitter), pointing to a symmetrical triangle on the cryptocurrency’s weekly chart, from which XRP could soon break out of.



The price of XRP has been trapped within this triangle for several years, reflecting a potential tug-of-war between buyers and sellers. A successful breakout, Carter said, would see XRP move upward significantly.







A recent price dip in April, mirroring a broader market correction, saw XRP retest the lower boundary of the symmetrical triangle. In technical analysis, such a retest is often viewed as a potential precursor to a breakout, where the price decisively breaches one of the trendlines, and the rest was interpreted as a potential signal for a breakout.







            
            

            
            

            
            

        

Should a breakout from the symmetrical triangle materialize, Carter projects an initial surge towards $0.93, a level XRP briefly touched in July 2023 following a positive development in the ongoing legal battle with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). 



However, Carter believes XRP will surpass this resistance level and reach a more ambitious mid-term target of $1.68, representing a staggering increase of over 200% from its current price level.



XRPUSD Chart via TradingView



Despite the bullish analysis,  the cryptocurrency market remains inherently volatile, and unforeseen events can significantly impact price movements. Additionally, the lingering SEC lawsuit, which centers around XRP’s classification as a security, continues to cloud the token’s future.



A negative outcome in the lawsuit could dampen investor sentiment and derail any potential price surge. Nevertheless, other analysts remain bullish, with Egrag Crypto recently saying a potential surge to the $4 mark is “feasible.”

Ethereum (ETH) on Verge of Fall, XRP Death Cross Solidifies, Solana (SOL) Breakout Could Be Fake

Ethereum is currently on the edge of a significant price drop. As of the latest charts, Ethereum is trading close to the $3,000 mark, a critical psychological barrier. This precarious position signals a potential fall toward $2,950, an event watched closely by market observers.The trading volume, while subsiding, hints that this potential dip could be temporary. However, the stability of Ethereum's price largely hinges on its ability to maintain support at $2,961. The fall below this level would cause a more pronounced drop to around $2,780. This scenario is not just a minor fluctuation; it points to larger issues at play within the Ethereum trading environment. ETH/USD Chart by TradingViewThe overall situation on the Ethereum chart does not inspire much confidence at the moment. One of the more concerning signs is the possible convergence of moving averages. This event typically indicates upcoming volatility, suggesting that the market could be gearing up for significant price movements. Such volatility can sometimes lead to a bullish breakthrough, although in the current climate, such an outcome is not guaranteed.XRP faced deathXRP is currently facing a "death cross." This occurs when the shorter-term 50-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA) crosses below the longer-term 200-day EMA, a classic bearish indicator in trading circles. For XRP, this pattern is not just a theoretical concern but a visible sign on the charts, indicating that the downtrend could intensify.The formation of the death cross on XRP's chart suggests that the current downtrend could worsen. There is a looming possibility that XRP could fall toward $0.50, or potentially even lower. This technical setup is crucial for traders as it often precedes further declines in price, reflecting bearish sentiment among investors.However, it is not all doom and gloom. There is a notable trendline support around the $0.51 mark. If this support holds, it could prevent further immediate losses and offer some respite to holders. But with current trading volumes remaining low, the downward pressure on XRP's price remains a concern. Low volume often means less market activity, which can make the price more susceptible to sharp moves on relatively small trades.Looking ahead, traders and investors will be keenly watching for a potential reversal of this trend. A "golden cross," which occurs when the 50-day EMA crosses above the 200-day EMA, would be a bullish signal and could indicate that the value of XRP is set to increase. Such a cross is renowned for signaling the start of a significant upward rally in asset values.Solana's fakeoutSOL appeared poised for gains, but its failure to breach the 50-day Exponential Moving Average and subsequent reversal has raised suspicions of a false breakout.Typically, a genuine breakout is supported by strong trading volume and a decisive crossing of key technical levels such as moving averages. For Solana, however, the volume has been on the decline, contradicting the initial upward price movement. This lack of volume support is a red flag, suggesting that the breakout might not have the momentum to sustain itself.Adding to the concerns is SOL's inability to hold above the $150 price level. It quickly reversed back toward lower prices, indicating that the market might not be ready for a sustained upward trend. This behavior is often indicative of a "fakeout," where the price briefly breaks out of a key resistance or support level only to revert back into its previous range.The convergence of moving averages could potentially introduce some volatility, offering a glimmer of hope for an uptick. However, current market conditions do not favor a robust recovery. Solana has recently dipped below the trendline that previously acted as resistance, and it now faces a critical support level at $140, which aligns with the 100-day EMA.For any significant recovery to appear on the chart, it would require a broader market rally, which seems unlikely at the moment. The overall crypto market is experiencing a correction, and without a positive shift in sentiment and market dynamics, Solana's chances of a strong rebound are close to nonexistent.

Robinhood Q1 crypto trading surges 224% - SEC action ‘disappointing’

Robinhood CEO Vladimir Tenev described the recent Securities and Exchange Commission Wells notice as a “disappointing development” during a Q1 earnings call, as the firm posted a 224% increase in crypto trading volumes in the quarter to $36 billion. Robinhood’s crypto-related services contributed to nearly 40% of its transaction-based revenue of $329 million, helping the firm record its second straight profitable quarter with a net income of $157 million.But the strong quarter earnings results come in light of a Wells notice handed to the firm by the United States securities regulator last week, which targets Robinhood’s crypto listings and custodian operations.Tenev said the news was a “disappointing development.” Its chief financial officer, Jason Warnick, stressed the firm has adopted a conservative approach toward its coin listings and services and holds its crypto business to the same legal and compliance standards as its brokerage business.“So it’s disappointing to see more regulation by enforcement here.”The Robinhood executives however stressed that customer accounts aren't impacted by the development."We're going to defend the firm and continue to advocate for our customers," Tenev added.Aside from the dilemma, Robinhood’s first quarter performance surpassed industry expectations, with its reported revenue of $618 million beating a $534.5 million estimate by investment research firm Zacks by 15.6%.Robinhood shares rallied as high as 7.3% to $19.15 in after-hours trading but has since cooled off to $18.55, according to Google Finance.HOOD’s change in share price on May 8.

Ethereum-Based Altcoin Leads Real-World Assets Sector in Development Activity, According to Santiment - The Daily Hodl


								Blockchain analytics platform Santiment says one Ethereum (ETH)-based altcoin project is leading in the real-world asset (RWA) sector based on development activity.
Santiment says that blockchain oracle Chainlink (LINK) is seeing the greatest amount of daily activity on the development hosting platform GitHub.










LINK Is seeing more than two times the amount of development activity compared to the second most active blockchain project, Synthetix (SNX), a decentralized finance (DeFi) crypto that allows synthetic asset creation on Ethereum.
 “Here are crypto’s top real-world assets by development. This list is compiled by counting any non-redundant GitHub activity, and averaging this daily activity over the past 30 days. Chainlink currently produces 2.49x more daily activity than the next most active project, Synthetix, in the RWA sector.”
Santiment’s ranking list is as follows: 1. Chainlink 2. Synthetix.io 3. Centrifuge (CFG) 4. Dusk (DUSK) 5. Oraichain (ORAI) 6. Creditcoin (CTC) 7. IX Swap (IXS) 8. Maker (MKR) 9. Polymesh Network (POLYX) 10. Reserve Rights (RSR).

Santiment also says that the native asset of decentralized oracle protocol Tellor (TRB) is outperforming most other digital assets so far this month.
“Tellor is one of the top performing assets thus far in May, exactly doubling in market cap since the calendar month turned. Whale transactions and address activity have both seen sudden spikes, which are suggesting potential TRB profit takes.”

Tellor is trading for $111.64 at time of writing, up 16% in the last 24 hours.

JPMorgan Onyx CEO Criticizes Public Blockchains for Large Transactions



                    

In a recent discussion at the BIS Innovation Summit on May 7, JPMorgan‘s Onyx blockchain-based payment platform CEO, Umar Farooq, highlighted the inadequacies of public blockchains for managing large transactions. 



He stated, “I think you almost need something like [a Unified Ledger]. I mean, it’s actually almost a necessity because if you look at […] public blockchain ledgers, they are not fit for purpose for large transactions today.”




Farooq’s comments were in response to the Unified Ledger, a concept introduced by the Bank of International Settlements (BIS) aimed at facilitating central bank money flows, tokenized deposits, and digital assets on its network.



He elaborated on the risks associated with public blockchains, pointing out the lack of accountability in cases where substantial transactions fail. 



“Who do I sue? […] You need to get somewhere where people can do trusted transactions between financial institutions with some sort of accountability in the system,” Farooq emphasized.




Despite criticizing public blockchains, Farooq leads a platform that operates as a private, permissioned version of Ethereum, the second-largest public blockchain. 



This private chain variant allows for transaction reversals, differentiating it significantly from its public counterparts.



Additionally, Farooq critiqued the incentive structures of cryptocurrencies on public blockchains, which he believes are designed to increase user numbers and thus the price of the coins.

He suggested that blockchains should evolve to be seen more as a public good rather than mechanisms for financial gain: “We need to get to an evolution point where the technology starts to be seen as a public good versus as a means to enrich.”



In contrast to JPMorgan’s preference for private blockchain solutions, other traditional financial institutions seem to favor public blockchains for asset tokenization. 



Celisa Morin, former vice president of platform distribution at Grayscale, indicated that entities like BlackRock are increasingly interested in public blockchains for these purposes. 



Morin stated, “I think we see a preference for private chains with JPMorgan’s Onyx. But I do think that this was the narrative a few years back. Now, I think it’s very much the public blockchains.”



Highlighting the growth of public blockchain utilization, BlackRock’s $100 million tokenized “BUIDL” fund, launched on the Ethereum network on March 18, now holds over $382 million, making it the world’s largest tokenization fund, according to Dune data.

Twitter Touts ’Seamless‘ Blocking of Child Abuse Content as Elon Musk Faces Increased EU Scrutiny - Decrypt

Social media giant Twitter says a new system to prevent the spread of child sexual abuse material (CSAM) on its platform was “deployed seamlessly,” testing technology developed by the non-profit group Thorn.The Twitter Safety account announced on Tuesday that it participated in a beta test of the group's AI-powered Safer solution to proactively detect, delete, and report text-based material containing child sexual exploitation.“Through our ongoing partnership with Thorn, we’re doing more to create a safe platform,” the Twitter Safety account wrote. “This work builds on our relentless efforts to combat child sexual exploitation online, with the specific goal of expanding our capabilities in fighting high-harm content where a child is at imminent risk.”“This self-hosted solution was deployed seamlessly into our detection mechanisms, allowing us to hone in on high-risk accounts,” it continued.Launched in 2012 by actors Demi Moore and Ashton Kutcher, Thorn develops tools and resources focused on defending children from sexual abuse and exploitation. In April, Google, Meta, and OpenAI signed onto a pledge issued by Thorn and fellow non-profit organization All Tech is Human, vowing to enforce guardrails around their AI models.“We’ve learned a lot from our beta testing,” Thorn's VP of data science Rebecca Portnoff, told Decrypt. “While we knew going in that child sexual abuse manifests in all types of content, including text, we saw concretely in this beta testing how machine learning/AI for text can have real-life impact at scale.”As Portnoff explained, the Safer AI model comprises a language model trained on child safety-related texts and a classification system that generates multi-label predictions for text sequences. Prediction scores range from 0 to 1, indicating the model's confidence in the text's relevance to various child safety categories.While Portnoff could not disclose which other social media platforms were participating in the beta test of the Safer suite of products, she said the response from other companies has been positive.“Some partners shared that the model is particularly useful for identifying harmful child sexual abuse activity, prioritizing reported messages, and supporting investigations of known bad actors,” Portnoff said.Due to the proliferation of generative AI tools since the launch of ChatGPT in 2022, internet watchdog groups like the UK-based Internet Watch Foundation have sounded the alarm about a flood of AI-generated child pornography circulating on dark web forums, saying the illicit material could overwhelm the internet.The announcement by the Twitter Safety team came hours before the European Union demanded that the company explain reports of “decreasing content moderation resources.”The latest transparency report that Twitter submitted to EU regulators said Elon Musk’s cost-cutting measures have reduced the size of the platform’s content moderation team by almost 20% since October 2023, and cut the number of languages monitored from 11 to 7.“The commission is also seeking further details on the risk assessments and mitigation measures linked to the impact of generative AI tools on electoral processes, dissemination of illegal content, and protection of fundamental rights,” the demand adds.The EU opened formal proceedings against Twitter in December 2023 over concerns that the company violated the Digital Services Act across several areas, including risk management, content moderation, “dark patterns,” and data access for researchers.The commission said Twitter must provide the requested information by May 17, and address additional questions by May 27.Edited by Ryan Ozawa.Stay on top of crypto news, get daily updates in your inbox.

Trump Says He's ‘Good’ With Crypto, Trashes Biden Meme Coin BODEN - Decrypt

US Presidential candidate Donald Trump came out in support of cryptocurrency during a special event for Trump NFT holders at his Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida late Wednesday.The embattled former U.S. President and 2024 hopeful lamented that crypto companies are fleeing America. “Crypto is moving out of the U.S. because of hostility towards crypto,” Trump said. “We’ll stop it because I don’t want that—if we’re going to embrace it, we have to let them be here.”Taking questions from the crypto-savvy crowd, Trump said he would welcome campaign donations in Bitcoin and other tokens.Trump’s shifting views toward digital assets comes as analysts suggested on Tuesday that his winning the U.S. Presidential election in November would be good for Bitcoin. And he went after the incumbent, claiming Pres. Joe Biden is ignorant about crypto.“Biden doesn’t know,” Trump told the crowd, also taking aim at the chair of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).“[Gary] Gensler is very much against it, the Democrats are very much against it,” Trump said. “But I’m good with it.”Ron Hammond, government relations director at the Blockchain Association, drew a link between the Mar-a-Lago event and the passage of a resolution in the U.S. House condemning the SEC's policy on crypto banking.“I didn't think crypto would be an election issue, but today's polar opposite statements proved that,” he tweeted. “Twenty one Democrats today voted against their own party realizing the trend: it's a losing issue to be in the anti-crypto army.”In April, prices for Solana-based meme coins featuring caricatures of Trump and Biden surged, according to blockchain data from DexScreener. At one point, “Jeo Boden” and “Doland Tremp” had a market capitalization of $473 million and $83 million, respectively.Hearing that a token that pokes fun of Joe Biden was worth $240 million, Trump said: “That's a lot of money for a coin, I don't like that investment."Tonight's event was billed as an “extraordinary dinner held at the President's home in Palm Beach, Florida,” a perk of buying a Trump NFT.“President Donald Trump will host an extraordinary evening for some very special Trump Trading Card holders,” the official website touted. “Dubbed the Winter White House, you'll enjoy a once-in-a-lifetime experience at the president's historic residence and exclusive members only club.”Edited by Ryan Ozawa.Stay on top of crypto news, get daily updates in your inbox.

Neuralink Patient's Implants Slipped Out, But He Still Set a Brain Control Record - Decrypt

There was good news and bad news out of brain-computer interface company Neuralink, as the neurotechnology firm—co-founded by Elon Musk—marked 100 days since human tests began on its technology. Specifically, tests with one human subject: Noland Arbaugh, a quadriplegic man from Arizona.Arbaugh had the company's first-generation N1 Link device surgically implanted in January, and was able to go home the next day. Extensive testing followed, but the company reported in a progress update today that some of the ultra-thin electrodes inserted into his brain ”retracted,” reducing the amount of information—measured in bits-per-second (BPS)—being transmitted.“In response to this change, we modified the recording algorithm to be more sensitive to neural population signals, improved the techniques to translate these signals into cursor movements, and enhanced the user interface,” Neuralink wrote. “These refinements produced a rapid and sustained improvement in BPS that has now superseded Noland’s initial performance.”The intracortical implant consists of 1,024 electrodes in 64 flexible leads, or “threads,” each thinner than a human hair.Despite the setback, Neuralink said Arbauch has since been able to set a new brain control world record.Arbaugh achieved human brain-computer interface (BCI) cursor control of 4.6 BPS, the company said, which surpassed the best results previously documented by researchers. He went on to achieve 8.0 BPS, and is currently trying to beat a Neuralink engineer’s score using a mouse of 10 BPS, the company said.Neuralink began working with Arbaugh after receiving the green light for human testing from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration in September. In its Wednesday update,tThe company outlined various ways the implant allowed the patient to interact with computers.“In the weeks since his surgery, Noland has used the Link to control his laptop from various positions, including while lying down in bed,” Neuralink said. “He plays online computer games with friends (Chess, Civilization VI), browses the internet, live streams, and uses other applications on his MacBook, all by controlling a cursor with his mind.”Arbaugh also used the link to play Mario Kart on a Nintendo Switch, something he hasn't been able to do since his spinal cord injury. But it wasn't all fun and games.“Noland contributes to research sessions for up to 8 hours per day,” the company noted. “On weekends, personal use and recreation can exceed 10 hours per day, [andrecently, he used the device for a total of 69 hours in a single week: 35 hours of structured sessions and an additional 34 hours of personal use.”Arbaugh said that he has come to find the N1 Link superior to the way he used to control a cursor on a computer screen, which Neuralink described as “a mouth-held tablet stylus (mouth stick) that had to be put in place by a caregiver.”“I thought that the mouth stick was a lot better than BCI a month ago,” Arbaugh said in the update. “When we compared them, I saw that BCI was just as good if not better, and it's still improving—the games I can play now are leaps and bounds better than previous ones.”“I’m beating my friends in games that, as a quadriplegic, I should not be beating them in,” he added.Last week, Arbaugh hosted a livestream on Twitter where he demonstrated Neuralink technology in action.“I think it should give a lot of people a lot of hope for what this thing can do for them, first and foremost their gaming experience, but then that'll translate into so much more—and I think that's awesome,” Arbaugh said.Edited by Ryan Ozawa.Stay on top of crypto news, get daily updates in your inbox.

Render Soars 50% In 1 Week: Whales Accumulating As Apple Jumps In


                            Render is on the move. Price statistics show that the coin is on an uptrend, rising by 50% in the last week due to surging trading volume. 
The uptick is primarily due to increased whale interest, which appears to be accumulating, moving RNDR from exchanges. At the same time, bulls are finding tailwinds following Apple’s decision to leverage Render in its Octane X rendering software.
Whales Accumulating RNDR, Token Moved From Binance
Lookonchain data on May 8 shows that the RNDR leg up follows massive token withdrawals from Binance, one of the leading crypto exchanges. The analytics provider notes that one address, 0x15CF, withdrew 748,898 RNDR tokens (worth approximately $5.3 million) from Binance between April 30 and May. 
Of note, Lookonchain analysts note, is that the address boasts of a remarkable track record with RNDR. The whale has profited on RNDR in six out of seven trades, raking over $3.5 million in profits.

Besides this, other withdrawals include 364,586 RNDR (worth over $3.68 million) by 0x1Cb7, who has previously made $480,000 on RNDR. Additionally, another transfer of 181,922 RNDR ( worth over $1.81 million) by 0xCA9C from Binance.

Usually, transfers from centralized exchanges to external, non-custodial protocols or wallets are seen as bullish. This is because on Binance, for instance, RNDR or any other token holder can swap the token for another or cash, essentially liquidating and increasing supply. 
This is harder on non-custodial protocols because liquidity is challenging due to the absence of other crypto or fiat ramps.
Apple Integration Boosts Demand
RNDR prices also rose following news that Apple would feature Render Network in its Octane X software. Octane X is a GPU renderer for macOS users. In a keynote, Apple said this software will empower artists with high rendering capabilities.
Most importantly for RNDR holders, Apple content creators will leverage Render’s decentralized computing power whenever they need to process complex scenes and high-definition animations. By tapping into Render, artists will benefit from faster rendering times and lower costs typically incurred when producing high-quality videos or 3D modeling.

On Apple’s side, integrating Render and easing activity on its iCloud services helps reduce server workload, boosting efficiency. Additionally, analysts said developers might gain access to Render via Apple’s developer tools. Subsequently, they can create more demanding models or files without expensive hardware.

At spot rates, RNDR prices are firm, extending gains. It is up 50% from May lows as bulls target March highs of $13.

Ethena Partners With Bybit, Is This An "Attack" On USDT And USDC?


								In a post on X, one analyst now claims traditional fiat-backed stablecoins like USDT and USDC should prepare for a “major” attack due to the increasing popularity of Ethena’s USDe. The warning follows Ethena and USDe’s integration with Bybit, a crypto exchange allowing perpetual trading.
Ethena Partners With ByBit
USDe is not fiat-backed like other popular stablecoins. Instead, it is a “synthetic dollar” backed by diverse assets, mainly staked ETH derivatives and short positions posted on centralized exchanges like Binance.

Announcing the partnership, Ethena, the issuer of USDe, took to X to celebrate the deal and its potential to transform the crypto trading scene. The platform said traders could earn a yield on USDe, which can be used as collateral for futures trading. 
Additionally, Ethena noted that users can use their stablecoin in spot trading pairs like Bitcoin and Ethereum without paying fees.
Will This Reduce USDT’s Dominance?
However, while the partnership is bullish for ENA, the native token of the Ethena platform, and could drive demand for USDe, one analyst is doubtful. The observer said the deal constitutes a “direct” attack on the more dominant stablecoins, USDT and USDC, which traders widely use in almost all crypto perpetual trading platforms.
The analyst pointed out offers Ethena dangles via the Bybit integration that could entice traders away from USDT and USDC. For one, traders earning nothing whenever they trade perpetually will receive a yield. 
This yield, in turn, will be used to negate funding fees if they choose USDe over USDT or USDC as their margin. Given the high double-digit yield currently standing at 15%, the decision to dish out “free money” for holding USDe, as expected, would impact the dominance of USDT and USDC. 
Even so, there are questions about the high yields, with some saying the model is unsustainable. Critics add that the $10 million Reserve Fund placed as a safety net won’t be enough to prevent a depeg when yields fall.

Currently, USDT is the third most valuable cryptocurrency after Bitcoin and Ethereum. When writing, it had a market cap of over $111 billion. As crypto finds adoption and prices recover from the recent plunge, the stablecoin will likely cement its position in the leaderboard.

On the other hand, USDe has a TVL of over $2.5 billion. From Ethena’s homepage, there are over 175,000 holders.

Bitcoin vs Ethereum: How they have fared since January's ETF approval - AMBCrypto



Ethereum has recorded low capital inflows since January compared to Bitcoin.
ETH’s long-term holders continue to wait for a new all-time high.

Leading altcoin Ethereum [ETH] has underperformed compared to Bitcoin [BTC] since January, Glassnode found in a new report. 
According to the on-chain data provider, while BTC, aided in part by the US spot exchange-traded funds (ETF), has seen significant capital inflows since the beginning of the year, ETH has recorded a decline in trading activity. 
ETH remains in BTC’s shadows
Following the approval of spot Bitcoin ETFs on the 10th of January, Glassnode data shows a significant divergence in Net Unrealized Profit/Loss (NUPL) between BTC and ETH. 
In its report, the on-chain analytics firm noted that this suggests that BTC’s investors have captured a larger share of profits compared to their ETH counterparts since then.
The NUPL metric determines whether an asset’s holders are experiencing unrealized gains or losses. It compares the average purchase price of all tokens held by investors to the current market price. 
If the market price is higher, there is a net-unrealized profit, while if it is lower, there is a net-unrealized loss.
According to Glassnode, a significant threshold for the NUPL is when the value exceeds 0.5. This is because it signals that an asset’s unrealized profit is greater than 50% of its total market capitalization.
Glassnode said,
“Amidst the hype and market rally surrounding (the) approval of the spot Bitcoin ETFs, the unrealized profit of Bitcoin holders expanded considerably faster than that of Ethereum investors. As a result, the Bitcoin NUPL metric crossed 0.5 and entered the euphoria phase three months before than equivalent metric for Ethereum.” 
Source: Glassnode
Further, ETH has yet to see a strong inflow of new capital as BTC has since spot ETFs became tradeable in the US. 
Glassnode assessed the Short-Term Holders’ Realized Cap for both coins and found that ETH’s remains low.
 This suggests reduced activity from the coin’s short-term investors, whose actions are known to significantly influence an asset’s price performance. 
The report further stated,
“In many ways, this lack of new capital inflows is a reflection of the under-performance of ETH relative to BTC. This is likely in part due to the attention and access brought about by the spot Bitcoin ETFs.” 
On why this might be happening, Glassnode added:
“The market is still awaiting the SEC’s decision for approval of a suite of ETH ETFs expected towards the end of May.”

Due to the difference in the performance of the coins, BTC and ETH’s long-term holders (LTHs) have adopted different strategies. 
While BTC’s LTHs have let go of some of their holdings to book profits following the coin’s rally to a new all-time high, ETH’s LTHs –
 “Appear to still be waiting for better profit-taking opportunities.”

FTX Announces Full Customer Reimbursements, But The Real Winners May Surprise You | Bitcoinist.com


								In a surprising turn of events, bankrupt cryptocurrency exchange FTX recently announced a new repayment plan to reimburse creditors and customers in full. The plan also includes a substantial compensation offer to account for the time value of their investments. 
While customers initially expected to be the primary beneficiaries, the biggest winners in this repayment plan are not the customers themselves but rather bankruptcy traders.
Full Refunds Offered By FTX 
As reported by Bitcoinist, FTX’s reorganization plan, filed with the United States Bankruptcy Court of Delaware, outlines the allocation of funds to customers affected by the exchange’s fraudulent scheme. 

The plan involves a centralized distribution of all the company’s assets from its collapse in November 2022 to its creditors and customers. FTX has disclosed various settlements with primary economic stakeholders, some pending finalization and court approval. 
Notably, a key settlement involves resolving the $24 billion in claims filed by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS), with FTX agreeing to a $200 million cash payment and a $685 million subordinate claim.
Elevating Bankruptcy Traders To Winners
Contrary to expectations, the true beneficiaries of the repayment plan are bankruptcy traders who swiftly moved to purchase claims at a fraction of their value before FTX officially filed for bankruptcy. 
These hedge funds and individual investors have seen the bid price of claims rise from 10% to 101%, demonstrating their shrewdness in seizing this opportunity.
According to Fortune Magazine, hedge funds specializing in distressed debt, such as Attestor, Baupost, and Farallon, have emerged as frontrunners in reaping substantial returns from FTX’s assets. 
These funds, which acquired claims worth “hundreds of millions of dollars,” stand to make significant profits. Other notable beneficiaries include Louis d’Origny, the founder of claims buying platform FTX Creditor, who is set to profit over $25 million from personal investments.
However, while the repayment plan has yielded impressive gains for some, not all claimants are satisfied. Some investors argue that the present-day value of their crypto tokens should be honored, expressing concerns over how assets were sold. 
Arush Sehgal, an investor and former member of the FTX unsecured creditors’ committee, criticizes the estate’s selling practices and claims that damage done by the current administrator exceeds the original crime committed by former CEO Sam Bankman-Fried.

The failed co-founder and CEO of the exchange Bankman-Fried was sentenced to 25 years in prison for defrauding customers and is currently being held at the Metropolitan Detention Center in Brooklyn.

FTT is trading at $2.015, up more than 25% in the last 24 hours alone, fueled by the repayment announcement.

From $30 to $147,000: How a Trader Scored a Stunning 4,906x Gain With Memecoins | Cryptoglobe


                                
A cryptocurrency trader has managed to win a “lottery ticket” by scoring a 4,906x gain on their small cryptocurrency investment to make a life-changing sum with just $30 to start,  turning the funds into a whopping $147,000.



According to on-chain analysis service Lookonchain, the cryptocurrency trader struck an incredibly lucky streak by adopting a high-risk, high-reward strategy involving meme coins, a sub-sector of the crypto market known for its extreme volatility, and small bets worth fractions of one Solana (SOL) token.



The trader diversified their investments in these memecoins as if they were buying lottery tickets for 0.1, 0.2, or 0.3 SOL into each memecoin, and caught their winning “lottery ticket” with $AGORA, buying up tokens with $30 and then selling 2 million of them for $100,000.



The trader also managed to acquire 959,000 $MILK tokens worth $47,000 that they haven’t sold yet. In total, the trader’s initial $30 investment has ballooned to a staggering $147,000, representing a return of 4,906 times their investment.







This windfall highlights the potential for explosive growth within the memecoin market, but also underscores the inherent risks involved. The vast majority of meme coins experience significant price fluctuations and ultimately fizzle out, leaving investors with nothing.







            
            

            
            

            
            

        

Notably, Solana whales have been buying up memecoins amid a recent cryptocurrency market downturn that has seen the prices of these assets plunge.



According to data shared by on-chain analysis service Lookonchain, these Solana whales actively started accumulating memecoins as prices started dropping, with two major whales accumulating memecoins including Sloth-theme coin Slerf ($SLERF), Pepe-themed Book of Meme ($BOME,) and Jode Biden-based Jeo Boden ($BODEN).



The whales accumulated these tokens from popular cryptocurrency exchanges including KuCoin and Binance, with one whale moving 31,916 SOL worth over 44.5 million from KuCoin to spend nearly $300,000 on BODEN.



Another whale moved $2.25 million off of leading cryptocurrency exchange Biden, and then used up $1.12 million to buy SLERF, and $660,000 to buy BOME.

Bitcoin Bears Keeps Pushing, Why BTC Could Turn Bearish Below $60K?


                            Bitcoin price extended losses and traded below the $62,500 zone. BTC is showing bearish signs and might turn bearish if it settles below $60,000.

Bitcoin followed a bearish path and traded below $62,500.
The price is trading below $63,000 and the 100 hourly Simple moving average.
There is a connecting bearish trend line forming with resistance at $62,000 on the hourly chart of the BTC/USD pair (data feed from Kraken).
The pair could extend losses and revisit the $60,000 support zone in the near term.

Bitcoin Price Extends Decline
Bitcoin price struggled to stay above the $63,500 zone and extended losses. There was a move below the $63,000 and $62,500 levels. The bears even pushed it below $61,200.
A low was formed at $60,888 and the price is now consolidating losses. If there is a recovery wave, the price might struggle to clear the $62,000 resistance or the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the recent decline from the $65,500 swing high to the $60,888 low.
There is also a connecting bearish trend line forming with resistance at $62,000 on the hourly chart of the BTC/USD pair. Bitcoin is now trading below $63,000 and the 100 hourly Simple moving average.
Immediate resistance is near the $61,800 level. The first major resistance could be $62,000. The next key resistance could be $63,200 and the 100 hourly Simple moving average. It is close to the 50% Fib retracement level of the recent decline from the $65,500 swing high to the $60,888 low.

The main hurdle is now at $63,800. A clear move above the $63,800 resistance might send the price higher. The next resistance now sits at $64,450. If there is a close above the $64,450 resistance zone, the price could continue to move up. In the stated case, the price could rise toward $65,500.
More Downsides In BTC?
If Bitcoin fails to climb above the $62,000 resistance zone, it could continue to move down. Immediate support on the downside is near the $60,850 level.
The first major support is $60,000. If there is a close below $60,000, the price could start to drop toward $58,000. Any more losses might send the price toward the $56,500 support zone in the near term.
Technical indicators:
Hourly MACD – The MACD is now gaining pace in the bearish zone.
Hourly RSI (Relative Strength Index) – The RSI for BTC/USD is now below the 50 level.

Bitcoin Whale Warning: BTC Appetites Shrink as Accumulation Dwindles, Data Shows | Cryptoglobe


                                
Major cryptocurrency whales are still buying the recent Bitcoin (BTC) price dip, but a recent report suggests that their conviction to the crypto market’s continued bull run may be dwindling.



According to data from analytics firm IntoTheBlock, there has been a potential shift in the behavior of major Bitcoin investors, often referred to as “whales,”  which have historically been quick to capitalize on price dips, accumulating BTC during periods of weakness.



IntoTheBlock’s analysis raises concerns about waning enthusiasm among these large investors, with its data indicating a decline in flows from wallets holding over 1,000 BTC, a metric that tracks the movement of Bitcoin in and out of these whale wallets.



This decline comes after a period of significant accumulation earlier this year, particularly during market pullbacks, with IntoTheBlock noting that while there’s a spike in whale accumulating after every price drop, each of these spikes “is smaller than the last.”







The firm’s analysis raises the question of whether whales have less appetite to buy the dip, after the flagship cryptocurrency’s latest halving event failed to materially help the price surge and as inflows to spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) started slowing.



Bitcoin is at the time of writing trading at $62,600 after moving up around 3% over the past week, but after losing nearly 10% over the last 30-day period, after a bull run that saw its price hit a new all-time high of around $73,500 after the launch of spot ETFs in the US.







            
            

            
            

            
            

        

While the halving failed to so far help BTC’s price move up, Coinbase shared on the microblogging platform X (formerly known as Twitter) that historical data shows the price of Bitcoin “is range bound for the first few months after the halving before price action increases significantly.”







The data shows that Bitcoin is currently following its historical patterns and could still move up significantly in the near future as the lower incoming supply starts impacting the market.



As CryptoGlobe reported BNP Paribas, the second-largest bank in Europe whose asset management arm has over $600 billion in assets under management, has gained exposure to the flagship cryptocurrency via a spot exchange-traded fund.



Large institutional investors managing over $100 million in assets have to, every quarter, disclose their holdings via 13F filings and after the successful launch of spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds in the U.S., these filings have been closely watched by industry sleuths.



While previous filings for the first quarter of 2024 showcased purchases by asset managers, family offices, and several smaller banks, BNP Paribas’ involvement marks a turning point even though the bank allocated a miniscule part of its holdings to the flagship cryptocurrency, acquiring around $40,000 worth of it.

Nigeria Refutes Binance's Bribery Allegations, Calls Them 'Diversionary Tactics' | Bitcoinist.com


								Nigeria has rejected bribery allegations made by Binance, the world’s largest cryptocurrency exchange, labeling them as a “tactic to divert” attention from the exchange’s activities. 
The statement comes in response to a blog post by Binance’s newly appointed CEO, Richard Teng, who claimed that the Nigerian government demanded a $150 million cryptocurrency payment to settle an ongoing criminal investigation.
Nigerian Government Slams Binance’s Bribery Claims
According to Bloomberg, Nigerian Ministry of Information spokesman Rabiu Ibrahim dismissed Teng’s bribery allegations as baseless and lacking substance. 
Ibrahim stated that the Binance CEO’s claim was a mere diversionary tactic aimed at shifting focus away from the cryptocurrency exchange’s activities. The Nigerian government firmly denies involvement in any bribery attempts.

According to Teng’s blog post, Binance attended a meeting with Nigerian officials in January, during which criminal allegations were raised against the company. 
Teng claimed that as Binance staff left the meeting, they were approached by unknown individuals who demanded a significant cryptocurrency payment within 48 hours to settle the allegations. 
The blog post also mentioned that Gambaryan and his colleague returned to Nigeria in February at the authorities’ invitation but were subsequently arrested.
While one employee has managed to escape in recent months, Tigran Gambaryan remains in custody. He faces charges of tax evasion, currency speculation, and money laundering. His trial is scheduled to commence later this month.
Nigeria Intensifies Scrutiny Of Cryptocurrencies
The Nigerian government dismisses Binance’s bribery claims as part of the company’s “orchestrated international campaign” to undermine Nigeria’s reputation. 
The government also accuses Binance of resorting to fictional claims and mudslinging media campaigns to clear its name amidst criminal prosecutions in multiple countries, including the United States.
It is worth noting that Nigeria has been scrutinizing the role of cryptocurrencies in the depreciation of the local currency, the naira. The government attributes part of the currency’s decline to foreign exchange control adjustments and increased volatility. 
To address concerns, the Securities and Exchange Commission banned person-to-person cryptocurrency trading in the naira and indicated that new regulations would be implemented to govern the sector.

In addition to the issues in Nigeria, Binance founder Changpeng Zhao was recently sentenced to four months in prison in the US for failures that allowed cybercriminals and terrorist groups to trade freely on the platform. The exchange also agreed to pay $4.3 billion to resolve allegations raised by US authorities.
Binance has not yet responded to the Nigerian government’s accusations and denials. It remains to be seen how the exchange will address the situation or provide any further clarification regarding the allegations.

XRP price's potential 650x surge - Examining if $20 is altcoin's next target - AMBCrypto



XRP would hit the $20 mark by 2026 amidst ongoing legal issues with the SEC.
Analysis suggested continued downward price pressure, which metrics show increased interest.

Ripple [XRP], a leading cryptocurrency, has faced significant challenges due to an ongoing lawsuit with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. 
So far, the asset has experienced a drastic 84.7% decline from its all-time high of $3.40 in 2018 and has yet to recover a fraction of its peak value.
This consistent drop in price has extended: Over the past 30 days, XRP’s value has dropped nearly 20%.
 Although there was a minor uptick last week, the cryptocurrency has started to lose those gains, currently showing a 2.3% decrease over the past 24 hours. 
However, despite the bearish pressure, an analyst has predicted that XRP has a bright future.
A bullish case for XRP
Armando Pantoja, a noted crypto analyst, remains optimistic about XRP’s potential, estimating its value to reach between $8 and $20 by 2026.
 This projection implies a dramatic increase of up to 3,557.6% from its current levels.
 Pantoja cites reasons why this surge could be possible, citing the 2017 bull run, where XRP surged over 650 times to its peak, as a “Historical Precedent Powerhouse” for such growth.
Institutional adoption is a strong driver for XRP’s future price. So far, Ripple, the company behind XRP, has seen significant integration into major financial institutions like Bank of America and Royal Bank of Canada. 
Additionally, Ripple’s recent partnership with HashKey DX to introduce XRP Ledger-based solutions in Japan, and collaboration with SBI Ripple Asia, could propel XRP’s price upward.
Despite these adoptions, movement is still being made to accelerate further adoptions. 
For instance, RippleX, Ripple’s development arm, has introduced important upgrades to the XRP Ledger (XRPL), such as the XLS-68d specification. 
This enhancement allows platforms to cover transaction fees for others without distributing free XRP, simplifying the onboarding process. 
These developments are vital for broadening XRP’s appeal and utility in the digital economy.
In addition to institutional adoption, Pantoja highlights the influence of market trends and the increasing utility of financial services. 
He forecasts that XRP will soon achieve legal clarity and see a significant expansion in partnerships.
Regarding the legal developments with Ripple and the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), tensions escalated in March when the SEC sought a substantial $2 billion fine against Ripple for purported violations related to institutional sales of XRP. 
Ripple has refuted these allegations, with Chief Legal Officer Stuart Alderoty presenting the firm’s detailed rebuttal last week. 
Ripple’s defense challenges the SEC’s assertions and suggests a much lower fine, ideally below $10 million.
Reports have it that the US SEC has filed its final reply to the fine opposition, however, the documents are under seal and yet to be inaccessible to the public.
As the lawsuit approaches its concluding stages, the crypto community is keenly watching to see the outcome and whether XRP can surpass its previous highs and potentially soar into double digits.
XRP’s possible short-term move
Meanwhile, Technical analysis indicates that XRP may continue to face downward pressure in the near term.
 The asset has consistently broken its structure on the daily and 4-hour charts, recently capturing liquidity and now targeting the swing low near $0.48.
Source: TradingView
 
This bearish short-term outlook is reinforced by a recent report from AMBCrypto, which noted that the Chaikin Money Flow for XRP was at zero, indicating no significant inflow of capital into the market.

Realistic or not, here’s XRP’s market cap in BTC terms

However, despite these bearish indicators, data from Santiment shows an increase in metrics such as social dominance, total holders, and active addresses for XRP. 
This suggests that many in the community remain optimistic and confident about the asset’s future.

Crypto degens ‘hungry’ for next big SocialFi breakthrough - K33 Research

Crypto users are clamoring to find the next big thing in the Social Finance (SocialFi) sector, according to analysts from K33 Research — who see it a growing corner of crypto despite being plagued by “perverse incentives.”In a May 8 research report, K33 DeFi analyst David Zimmerman wrote that following a recent Firend.tech airdrop, crypto users are already looking to a new SocialFi app called Fantasy Top – built on Ethereum layer-2 network Blast — as the next potential opportunity.Fantasy Top is a SocialFi game allowing users to buy and sell virtual trading cards of crypto-affiliated X accounts and use them to compete in tournaments. These tournaments are paying users for their activity on the platform in ETH, a reward token on Blast called GOLD, native “fan points” and additional packs of trading cards. As of the time of publication, a starting pack of trading cards on Fantasy will set users back around 0.39 ETH — $1,200 at current prices. Trading card starter packs are going for a call $1193. Source: Fantasy TopZimmerman noted that while SocialFi activity may prove profitable for some and that Fantasy Top may even yield a novel product that could be “fun to use” — the SocialFi sector is still prone to a fundamental problem that arises from “perverse incentives.”“Narratives are often flooded with cash grabs, and SocialFi is no different.”“Influencers are directly incentivized to shill the platform as ‘heroes’ earn a 1.5% fee of the trading volume for their card on top of 10% of the pack sales. In addition, they will earn BLAST GOLD and “FAN points,” added Zimmerman. Despite there being several high profile launches of new layer-2 networks on Ethereum, Blast has “managed to hold on to relevancy” as users aggressively farm the Blast airdrop program.He added that the platform’s TVL remains high in USD terms despite the price of Ether (ETH) falling 17% in April.Blast TVL has held steady despite falling ETH prices. Source: K33 ResearchFriend.tech’s long-awaited airdrop went live on May 3 and was promptly met with an outcry of criticism from users which cited several technical difficulties that prevented them from accessing and subsequently selling their tokens as the airdrop occurred. Related: TikTok parent company explores on-chain possibilities for Web3 gamingThis outrage was amplified further when several large accounts on Friend.tech managed to sell outsized sums of the FRIEND token before many users could even access it, something that occurred as the price of the native token fell roughly 90% from a peak price of roughly $28 to a price of $1.93 at the time of publication. Source: Luke MartinOutside of Friend.tech and Fantasy Top, Zimmerman added that a lesser-known streaming and gaming platform called Sanko GameCorp — which offers a gaming platform called Sanko Dream Machine and a Twitch-like streaming service called SankoTV — is also picking up steam among crypto native users. “Sanko GameCorp was a fairly launched project and it is about to spin up its own L3. If we continue to see a backlash against VCs and insiders as we did with Eigenlayer, this could become a major playground for (anti-VC) memecoin madness,” he said.

Emergency ‘wall of liquidity’ to prop up Yen bullish for Bitcoin: Swan

A declining Japanese yen may end up a “disaster” for United States treasuries, which in turn, could be a boon to Bitcoin (BTC) as investors flock to alternative stores of value, according to an executive from Swan Bitcoin. At the time of publication, 1 JPY is the equivalent to 0.0064 USD, losing 2.39% strength over the past 30 days, as per Google Finance data.“This spells disaster for Japan and the U.S. potentially, as Japan is the largest holder of U.S. treasuries, only 4% of its forex reserves are in gold, the rest are almost exclusively in U.S. treasuries,” Swan Bitcoin head of business Dante Cook explained in a May 8 episode of Bitcoin Daily.Cook believes that unless the U.S. government intervenes with swaplines — which is an agreement between two central banks to exchange currencies — or backdoor liquidity, Japan will be forced to sell its U.S. treasuries, in order “to prop up its currency.”He argues that the sell-off might create uncertainty in traditional securities and lead to a "massive wall of liquidity" entering the market which could benefit Bitcoin, as investors seek safer, alternative stores of value.He explained that Bitcoin is already receiving a “wave of liquidity” from institutional investors since the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) approved 11 spot Bitcoin ETFs in January.Dante Cook speaking on the latest episode of Swan Bitcoin's Bitcoin Daily. Source: Swan BitcoinSince its launch, the 11 spot Bitcoin ETFs have seen total net inflows of $11.78 billion, as per Farside data. Bitcoin is currently trading at $61,399, up 6.29% over the past week, according to CoinMarketCap data.Cook further argued that the current state of uncertainty in the traditional financial markets would lead to more people looking beyond Bitcoin and investing in riskier crypto altcoins.“Because the money is broken, more and more people are turning to gambling,” he claimed.Related: World’s largest pension fund explores diversifying into BitcoinOn top of this, Cook pointed to VanEck, a spot Bitcoin ETF issuer, which hasn’t been performing “great in the ETF race” but recently announced its MarketVector MEMECOIN index.“It’s kind of shocking that an institution would offer this to retail clients, but I guess it’s not at the same time,” he added, reiterating the uncertainty in traditional financial markets.The MEMECOIN index includes Dogecoin (DOGE) at 30%, Shiba Inu (SHIB) at 28%, PEPE (PEPE) at 14%, Dogwifhat (WIF) at 13%, Floki (FLOKI) at 7%, and Bonk (BONK) at 6%.Magazine: Buy altcoins now, but sell before ‘mid-2025’: Charles Edwards, X Hall of FlameThis article does not contain investment advice or recommendations.

Robinhood's $618 Million Revenue Surpasses Q1 Forecasts


Robinhood Markets Inc. showcased a resilient performance in the first quarter of 2024. It has transitioned from a significant loss last year to posting its second consecutive quarterly profit.
The company announced on Wednesday that its net income reached $157 million. This achievement marks a stark turnaround from a net loss of $511 million in the same quarter the previous year.
Robinhood’s Performance in Q1 Exceeded Expectations
In its latest quarterly report, Robinhood announced a 40% increase in net revenues, reaching $618 million. Transaction-based revenues increased by 59%, with crypto transactions playing a big part. Specifically, revenue from crypto transactions surged by 232%, amounting to $126 million.
Additionally, Robinhood reported a substantial increase in crypto assets under custody, which stood at $26 billion by the end of March. This represents a 78% rise from the end of 2023.

Robinhood also achieved all-time highs in both net deposits and Gold subscribers. Furthermore, the quarter saw Robinhood making significant strides in user engagement and product offerings. Jason Warnick, Robinhood’s Chief Financial Officer (CFO), expressed satisfaction with the results.

“We delivered significant revenue growth and margin expansion in Q1 as we remain focused on driving another year of profitable growth in 2024,” Warnick stated.

The results significantly exceeded Wall Street expectations. The earnings per share were 18 cents, far above the anticipated 6 cents. Meanwhile, the net revenue surpassed forecasts of $549 million.

Following the company’s growth and strong financial performance, Robinhood (HOOD) shares experienced a surge. During after-hours trading, the shares advanced by 6.3%, reaching $19.01.

However, Robinhood now faces increased scrutiny from the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). The SEC recently issued a Wells notice for potential violations concerning Robinhood’s crypto practices.

The concerns involve the platform’s crypto listings, custody, and operational procedures. This could result in various enforcement actions.
Robinhood’s Chief Executive Officer, Vlad Tenev, expressed frustration over the SEC’s actions on his X (Twitter) account. Tenev criticized the regulatory body for what he considers an excessive and damaging focus on crypto. He articulated a strong commitment to defending Robinhood’s business.

“While we strive to maintain positive and productive relationships with our regulators, if necessary we will use our resources to contest this matter in the courts, with the intent of both defending our crypto business and establishing regulatory clarity in the United States for the benefit of our customers,” Tenev affirmed.

This tension between Robinhood and the SEC is part of a broader regulatory tightening across the crypto sector. SEC Chairman – Gary Gensler has made clear his aim to enforce stringent regulations to safeguard investors and ensure comprehensive disclosures by crypto platforms. 
With the industry facing potential regulatory adjustments, the outcomes could significantly influence both Robinhood’s operations and the wider market environment.

Why Account Abstraction Is the Key Technology for the Future of Web 3.0 and GameFi UX - The Daily Hodl


								
 
The UX problem in Web 3.0 and GameFi has no one-size-fits-all solution. It is a sophisticated and interconnected issue – otherwise, we would have seen it solved many years ago.
Indeed, Ethereum has done a great job in lowering its transaction fees and increasing throughput. Similarly, layer-two solutions introduced greater and cheaper scalability to the system.
The UX, however, is still a tough entry barrier, and several unexpectedly popular DApps (decentralized applications) can still impose a huge workload on crypto networks.
The past years brought little change – now is the right time to focus on the overall UX improvement, and new blockchain technologies like ‘account abstraction’ can help.
Account abstraction – the Ethereum UX revolution
Imagine an average user attracted to a new viral DApp. They excitedly download the app to try the latest trend. Oh, they can’t do it just yet – they need a wallet first.
They may have heard about MetaMask, so that’s the low-hanging fruit.
Now, the wallet is there, but the majority of users have some sort of an upfront cost – this is simply their business model, an initial investment.
After all, isn’t our user used to small in-app purchases virtually everywhere else?
Still, you can’t buy tokens directly in a wallet, so most of the time they’ll head straight to whatever centralized exchange is the most popular in their region.
They fill in their passport info, residency address and a utility bill to prove it, and tax ID number, and submit a photo – hold on, the resolution is too low. And this one is too oversaturated. And this is way too shadowy.
Nice! It should only take the exchange’s KYC (know your customer) team a day or two to verify their identity. ‘The photo doesn’t match the photo on your passport.’ They have to resubmit.
Anticipation breeds appetite, and our user happily logs into the app, connects the wallet, and attempts to make their first balance refill – only to find out that the wanted token’s protocol is not supported by the exchange they’ve chosen.
They need to get used to this feeling – in the unlikely situation that such a user returns to the app, they will have to keep track of gas quotes, Ethereum balance for gas fees, native token balance for in-app payments and a stablecoin account to hedge their earnings against market volatility.
Oh, and don’t forget to store the seed phrase – otherwise, all the funds would be irrecoverably lost.?? This is simply not tolerable in 2024.
Now, we have the technology that could mitigate many of these hurdles – account abstraction.
In technical terms, account abstraction decouples the wallet from the private key, allowing customers to effectively use smart contracts as their accounts.
In practice, however, this translates to a revolution in the UX of DApps. Firstly, arbitrary verification allows users to set up an account via Google, Apple or other well-known methods.
Secondly, account abstraction facilitates sponsored transactions, providing users with the opportunity to pay gas fees in any ERC-20 token or automatically link them to their fiat cards – no longer restricting users from maintaining a sufficient Ethereum (ETH) balance just for transactions to get through.
Account abstraction also enables trusted session functionality for GameFi projects, meaning that it wouldn’t need to approve each in-game purchase during the play session.
A smart contract wallet could approve certain transactions during the play session – or by any other parameters, like a fixed time, value, etc. – thus not tearing up the in-game user experience and keeping it safe.
As such, a trusted session will not be permanent.?? Ultimately, with account abstraction, an interested gamer would download the game from the App Store, log in via Apple credentials and begin to play.
Simple GameFi – just like that.
Layer-three solutions and the key to zero gas
Onboarding and wallet creation are not the only UX roadblocks for GameFi. A significant portion of challenges is caused by the gas concept itself.
One can even observe the correlation between GameFi activity and the spikes in gas fees.
Even if the fees are reasonably low, the very concept of paying an unpredictable extra amount is a major psychological deterrent.
A potential way out is layer-three zero-gas solutions.
Layer-three solutions are flexible application-specific blockchains that are built atop existing layer-two Ethereum projects.
Following the principle of Ethereum vertical scaling, layer-three introduces even greater throughput and even lower gas fees.
In fact, by combining it with the sponsored transactions feature of account abstraction, project owners can fully pay for their users’ commissions, enabling the first true free-to-play, play-to-earn experience.
Alternatively, developers can support different approaches towards paying gas fees – for instance, with cheap tradable in-game items or covering all users’ gas fees as part of a premium gaming account or through in-game rewards, like those found in battle pass models or special events.
Overall, such zero-gas solutions will create a smoother gaming process, making Web 3.0 gaming indistinguishable from the Web 2.0 experience.
No more annoying monetary roadblocks – just you and the game.
A technology-level enabler of UX excellence
The UX problem in Web 3.0 and GameFi is a really sophisticated one. Had it been simple, it would have been resolved long ago.
As the industry acknowledged the importance of UX, many roadblocks were gradually smoothened.
Still, only with the combination of new blockchain technologies like account abstraction and layer-three do I see a new-level enabler for Web 3.0 and GameFi UX to finally become as convenient as Web 3.0.
With most in-app actions processed off-chain, the main chain will benefit from reduced network loads and greater maximum throughput.
At the same time, zero-gas solutions and account abstraction will reduce unnecessary onboarding and in-app interaction steps, creating the most seamless experience for the user.
By the end of 2024, we may witness the emergence of a new generation of GameFi apps – distributed via popular app stores, linked to your preferred credentials, zero gas and with fiat withdrawals.
Just like the good old Web 2.0 gaming – but with data ownership that pays.

Optimism to roll out new Superchain features for layer-3 devs

Ethereum scaling solution provider Optimism is looking to take its blockchain throughput a step further by onboarding layer-3 applications on top of the OP Stack.On May 8, the Optimism team said that they were welcoming layer-3s to the Superchain where they can build on the OP Stack and share revenue with the Optimism Collective.The OP Stack is the open standard codebase that powers development on Superchain, but it “isn’t limited to L2 chain deployers and app builders,” said the team before adding “it can also be leveraged by an ecosystem of L3s.”Optimism Superchain is a network of layer-2 chains, known as OP Chains, which share security, communication layers, and open-source technology.Layer-3s will have access to benefits like eligibility for retro funding, airdrops, and developer grant programs, but may have limitations on certain features like interoperability, it noted. Layer-3 protocols are built on top of layer-2s to host application-specific decentralized applications, providing enhanced solutions for scaling, performance, interoperability, customization, and costs.Blockchain layers. Source: CoinGeckoThere are two key features coming to the OP Stack to support L3 builders — custom gas tokens, and “Plasma Mode.” Custom gas tokens, a highly requested feature in the final stages of development, allow developers to use a layer-2 token as the native gas token for a layer-3 protocol. This lowers onboarding costs as there is no need to perform costly transactions bringing gas tokens from L1 to L2, and then onto L3. Plasma Mode is an alternative to the data availability layer which can reduce the fixed overhead cost of operating an L3 compared to an L2. Data availability refers to the ability of network participants to access and verify the data stored on the blockchain.Related: Polygon’s ZK-rollup Ethereum scaler Miden hits testnetThe goal is to make the Optimism Superchain more accessible to developers by offering layer-3 features and functionality. However, not all are convinced that L3 is the way forward for Ethereum scaling. In April, Polygon CEO Marc Boiron argued that layer-3 networks were not necessary and could increase security risks to Ethereum by capturing value from the network. On May 9, Boiron reiterated his stance claiming that “L3s are worse than L2s,” before adding: “L2s allow you to settle back to Ethereum frequently and quickly. L3s do not. They always need to pass through their L2 overlords.” Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin commented on L3s in late 2022 stating that they will serve a different purpose to scaling by providing “customized functionality.” Rollup-based Optimism, or OP Mainnet, is the second largest layer-2 network with a total value locked of $6.76 billion giving it a market share of around 18%, according to L2beat.

                        An illegal XRP exchange operator has been sentenced to jail for eight years in South Korea after duping investors out of almost $3.4 million.The unnamed operator stole almost $2 million of the total from one individual, prosecutors explained in a trial at the Seoul High Court.
Illegal XRP Exchange Told Customers it Had a Deal With Ripple
The court upheld the verdict of a Seoul District Court. This court earlier sentenced the operator to 12 years in jail, Namdo Ilbo reported.However, the High Court judge ruled that the operator had taken steps to compensate one of their victims, and so reduced the sentence accordingly.The operator can now accept the verdict or appeal the judgment at the Supreme Court.The South Korean Supreme Court. (Source Pectus Solentis {Balibandi}[CC-BY-SA-2.0-kr])The High Court heard that the accused became the CEO of a “domestic cryptocurrency exchange” in 2015.The exchange “advertised” that it had “signed a formal supply agreement with” the XRP token issuer Ripple and Ripple Labs.The court heard that an individual referred to as B (for legal reasons) sent the exchange fiat worth around $2 million in 2015.The CEO told B they could pay 20% less than the market rate for the coins. However, the CEO convinced B to keep the coins on the exchange’s platform.XRP prices over the past seven days. (Source: CoinMarketCap)In 2017, the exchange told B that he could boost his XRP 2.35 million holdings to 3 million in three months. B was told they could do so by lending the coins to another victim (C).The coins were worth around $700,000 at the time, the media outlet reported.
More Victims Fell Victim to Fraud
The CEO also duped another investor, named D by the court. The operator, prosecution officials explained, duped D into handing over XRP coins in a loan deal.But instead of paying back this loan, the CEO traded D’s XRP for Bitcoin. He then sent the BTC to a wallet registered in his son’s name.The court said that some of the victims had “suffered enormous damage through no fault of their own.”Police were unable to recover most of the lost coins and fiat.CEO ‘Skipped Bail Before Re-arrest’
Witnesses also testified that the CEO had tried to convince them to make “false statements” absolving him of guilt.The CEO then tried to escape justice by “requesting a postponement of the sentencing date” and “asking for time to compensate for the damage.”When judges granted his requests, he took the opportunity to skip bail and go into hiding, before he was eventually rearrested two years later.In sentencing, the presiding High Court judge said:
“The defended has shown no signs of remorse. He has also shown serious disregard for the law, so he needs to be punished severely.”In February 2023, the CEO of a fake crypto bank was given a 10-year jail term after cheating thousands of South Korean investors out of a total of $181 million.In January 2023, the Supreme Court sent the head of V Global, another fake crypto exchange that also defrauded thousands of investors, to prison for 25 years.The head of another crypto exchange, Bitsonic, was jailed for seven years for price manipulation in February this year.

More than $20 million worth of bridged Ether (ETH) has been mysteriously returned to blockchain-based gambling project ZKasino wallet — almost three weeks after users accused platform founders of an exit scam. On May 9, an X feed set up to recover funds from the ZKasino exit scam reported that almost $21 million worth of wstETH (wrapped Lido staking ETH) had returned to the project’s multisignature wallet — prompting some to believe investors may soon be getting their funds back as originally promised. “One of the three scammers just sent the funds back to the original multi-sig wallet address,” the $JAIL feed said providing proof of the transfers with Etherscan. The 6,021 wstETH moved equates to around two-thirds of the amount that went missing in the heist, prompting the question “Could they be preparing to refund the victims?”Source: $JAILZKasino launched on April 20 offering an airdrop in its native token ZKAS to those that bridged ETH to the platform, promising to return the ETH. However, the gambling project instead moved around $33 million worth of users’ bridged Ethereum to the staking protocol Lido Finance, instead of returning the funds to users as originally promised.This led to accusations of an exit scam or rug pull as more than 10,000 people had bridged assets based on pledges made by the protocol that they claim was later broken. On April 29, Dutch authorities arrested a 26-year-old man suspected of being involved in the alleged ZKasino scam.Authorities seized around $12.2 million worth of cryptocurrencies, real estate, and luxury cars from the suspect at the time. Source: ShockSome in the crypto community speculated the arrested suspect could be the project founder going under the pseudonym “Derivatives Monke” who was doxxed as Elham Nourzai by blockchain sleuths. On May 8, Cointelegraph reported that the Binance on-chain investigations team played a key role in leading law enforcement to the arrest of the suspect.Binance also assisted by freezing millions of dollars worth of stolen crypto after receiving a seizure warrant from authorities against the attacker’s accounts.Despite the arrest, illicit funds continue moving on-chain, indicating other potential attackers may remain at large. However, the latest movement of funds back to the project’s multisig has renewed hope for victims.

White Pepe (WHPEPE) Will Surge 6,800% as MEXC Listing Announced, While Shiba Inu and Dogecoin Struggle



                    

White Pepe (WHPEPE) could turn early investors into multi-millionaires if it becomes a mainstream coin, like Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE).



White Pepe (WHPEPE), a new Solana memecoin that was launched this week, is poised to explode over 6,800% in price in the coming days.




This is because WHPEPE has announced its first centralized exchange listing, which will be on MEXC.



This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up.



Currently, White Pepe can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jupiter and Raydium, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days.




Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and White Pepe could become the next viral memecoin.



To buy White Pepe on Raydium or Jupiter ahead of the MEXC listing, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for White Pepe by entering its contract address – 58kSp6Sn8P42EdRDgud75YcvkRLnCpMxPb7MqCRHkUeG – in the receiving field.



In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price.



If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner.




The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum.



This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like WHPEPE.

                        Donald Trump, former US President and current presidential candidate, on Wednesday hosted a special event at his Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida for NFT owners, where he voiced his support for crypto.The presumptive Republican presidential candidate held the event for fans who purchased at least 47 of his NFTs, each costing $99.During a Q&A session, he agreed with a participant who said many cryptocurrency businesses are leaving the country “because of the hostility.” He likely pointed to the Securities and Exchange Commission’s recent enforcement actions against crypto companies, including industry leaders Binance and Coinbase, for allegedly offering unregistered securities.“Well, we’ll stop it because I don’t want that,” he said. “If we’re going to embrace it, we have to let them be.”Trump Questions Biden’s Understanding of Crypto
He also took a jab at incumbent president Joe Biden, suggesting he doesn’t understand cryptocurrency at all. He further criticized the Democrats, claiming they strongly oppose crypto.“I’m fine with it. I want to make sure it’s good and solid and everything else, but I’m good with it,” he added. “And if you like crypto in any form — it comes in a lot of different forms — if you’re in favour of crypto, you better vote for Trump.”Meanwhile, the government, under current president Biden, wants stricter rules for the industry.
StanChart Predicts Trump Win Could Boost Cryptocurrency Market
Earlier, Donald Trump was an outspoken critic of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, repeatedly voicing concerns about the assets. In July 2019, he showed his disapproval, calling them “not money” and criticizing their volatility and lack of underlying value. He further argued that these assets can be used for illegal activities like drug trafficking.Despite this, the leading Republican candidate has touted a pro-crypto stance during his election campaign. In January, he pledged to prevent establishing a Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC) if elected President in November, citing a desire to safeguard Americans from government overreach.“Such a currency would give the federal government absolute control over your money. They could take your money, and you wouldn’t even know it was gone,” he said.This week, StanChart analyst Geoff Kendrick suggested that cryptocurrencies could benefit from a second term for Trump. He argued that under a renewed Trump administration, there could be a generally favorable impact due to a more supportive regulatory climate.

3 memorable moments from Donald Trump’s ‘Mugshot’ NFT event

Former United States President Donald Trump made more than a few memorable quotes as he hosted a gaggle of nonfungible token (NFT) enthusiasts at his Florida home on Wednesday. Other than vowing to keep crypto entrepreneurs in the United States, Trump also took partial credit for making “NFTs hot again” thanks to his sizeable collection and even dissed a political rival’s inspired memecoin — inadvertently causing its price to surge. Countless clips of his most memorable lines surfaced on X on May 8, including: On crypto: “I’m good with it”One of the first clips to make the rounds on social media included Trump vowing to provide a better regulatory environment for crypto businesses and entrepreneurs by removing the “hostility” toward crypto — which he suggests is brought about by the Biden administration and the Securities and Exchange Commission.


“Gensler is very much against it. The Democrats are very much against it [but] I’m fine with it, I want to make sure it’s good and solid and everything else, but I’m good with it.”When asked what he would do to remove that hostility and keep innovators in the United States by NFT enthusiast “Malcolm,” Trump responded:“We’ll stop it because I don’t want that, I don’t want that. If we’re going to embrace it we have to let them be here.”On NFTs: “We made NFTs hot again”Trump also claimed that his Mugshot NFTs and other collections “made NFTs hot again” at a time when the NFT market seemingly lost its steam — which received an uproar of cheer from attendees.Most attendees had to purchase one of Trump’s Mugshots NFTs for $4,653 or more to be invited to the dinner event.Source: Donald TrumpTrump NFT Cards, POTUS and Melania Trump’s 1776 collection are among the other digital art collectibles linked to Donald Trump’s name.On BODEN: “That’s a lotta money for a coin”To no one’s surprise, Trump isn’t a fan of the Joe Biden-linked Jeo Boden (BODEN) meme coin, which currently boasts a market capitalization of over $260 million.“That’s a lotta, money for a coin, I don’t like that investment,” he said.BODEN spiked more than 10% shortly after his comments were shared on X.But another meme coin based loosely on Trump,Donald Tremp (TREMP), took the cake, skyrocketing nearly 110% over the same timeframe.The multibillionaire also poked fun at his political rival in a separate comment, mockingly suggesting he “has no idea” what crypto is.“If you’re in favor of crypto, you better vote for Trump.”


Trump previously referred to Bitcoin (BTC) as a scam in 2021 but has begun to embrace it and the broader industry in recent months. However, he still has a strong preference for maintaining the U.S. dollar’s dominance under the traditional banking system. Trump also recently said he would never allow for the creation of a central bank digital currency under his watch.Related: Former US President Donald Trump launches ‘MugShot’-themed NFT dropThe mugshot NFT came about after Trump surrendered himself to authorities in Georgia in August, 2023, where he was indicted on charges related to attempts to overturn the 2020 election.He must attend his criminal trial for falsifying business documents for a $130,000 payment to adult film star Stormy Daniels — separate from the charges he faces in Georgia, Florida and the District of Columbia. Trump has been in a New York courtroom on trial days since jury selection started on April 15. However, the court is not in session on Wednesdays, so he took the opportunity to fly down to his Florida residence on May 8 to host the event.Magazine: What do crypto market makers actually do?

Biden Administration Warns Against Overturning SEC Crypto Rule


The US House of Representatives has taken a significant step toward reshaping the regulation of digital assets by passing Representative Mike Flood’s bipartisan resolution, H.J.Res. 109, on May 8. This resolution seeks to overturn the Securities and Exchange Commission’s (SEC) Staff Accounting Bulletin (SAB) 121, which has been a point of contention within the financial and crypto communities.
Advocates for the bill argue that the SEC’s rule burdens financial institutions. They say it makes serving as custodians of digital assets too expensive.
Legislative Support vs. Presidential Veto: The Battle Over SAB 121
Under SAB 121, issued in March 2022, financial institutions must include customers’ digital assets on their balance sheets. Critics argue this accounting requirement causes significant operational and financial challenges. These challenges affect firms that custody cryptocurrencies and other digital assets.
By overturning SAB 121, supporters of H.J.Res. 109 believe it will remove regulatory barriers. This, in turn, will facilitate safer and more efficient digital asset transactions through regulated banks and financial institutions. Congressman Patrick McHenry highlighted the practical implications of SAB 121.

“If you want American assets to be protected, they should be held in custody, not on the bank’s balance sheet. […] And finally, if you want to send a message that rogue regulators cannot circumvent Congress in our well-established rule-making process, vote yes,” Congressman McHenry said.

The resolution has garnered support from various sectors of the industry and legislators who believe that the SEC’s rule represents an overreach of regulatory powers. This sentiment is echoed by House Majority Whip Tom Emmer, who emphasized the nonpartisan nature of digital asset innovation.

“We must work that way in Congress to ensure the digital asset ecosystem can thrive here in the United States,” Emmer affirmed.

However, the opposition to this resolution comes from the highest levels of government, including the President Joe Biden administration. They argue that overturning SAB 121 would weaken the SEC’s ability to protect investors and the broader financial system from the risks associated with crypto assets.

“Limiting the SEC’s ability to maintain a comprehensive and effective financial regulatory framework for crypto-assets would introduce substantial financial instability and market uncertainty. If the President were presented with H.J. Res. 109, he would veto it,” The White House stated.

Lawmakers Critique SEC’s Crypto Crackdown
Criticism of the SEC’s recent actions extends to its handling of major crypto platforms. For instance, the SEC’s issuance of Wells Notices to platforms like Robinhood has been portrayed by some lawmakers as an overextension of its regulatory mandate. US Representative John Rose argued that such actions exceed the SEC’s role to maintain orderly markets and protect investors.


“The SEC exceeded its mandate to protect investors and maintain fair, orderly markets by issuing a Wells Notice to Robinhood, a precursor to enforcement action. I’m proud to help lead the effort to provide clarity by passing the FIT for the 21st Century Act so that rogue regulators like Gary Gensler can focus on their mandate to protect investors and not disrupt innovation,” Congressman Rose said.

SEC Chairman Gary Gensler defended his strict regulatory approach in a CNBC interview. He aims to bring the crypto sector under tighter control.
Gensler spoke about the SEC’s oversight of a $110 trillion capital market. He views cryptocurrencies as prone to scams and fraud.
However, Gensler was reluctant to question whether Ethereum (ETH) is a commodity or security. Instead, he focuses on the lack of necessary investor disclosures and criticizes intermediaries’ practices in the centralized crypto markets.

SEC Commissioner Mark Uyeda critiqued this stance. FOX journalist Eleanor Terrett reported that Uyeda emphasized the need for a regulatory framework that accommodates innovation.

“While the easiest regulatory response to crypto and digital asset innovation is to use bad actors as an excuse to ‘shut it all down’, regulators should be creating a pathway to compliance for legitimate efforts. The SEC has yet to develop that pathway,” Uyeda explained.

As H.J.Res. 109 moves to the Senate, the implications of its potential approval loom large over the regulatory environment of digital assets. This highlights the ongoing debate between regulation and innovation in the crypto sector.

Coincheck's Nasdaq Listing Set for Completion Between Q2 and Q3 - Coin Edition


							

Coincheck plans to merge with Thunder Bridge Capital Partners IV, Inc. (THCP).



The merger, pending regulatory approvals, is expected to finalize in Q3-Q4 2024.



Despite a 2023 setback delaying its listing, Coincheck pursues global expansion via this strategic merger with THCP.




Japan-based cryptocurrency exchange Coincheck is teaming up with Thunder Bridge Capital Partners IV, Inc. (THCP), a Special Purpose Acquisition Company (SPAC) listed on Nasdaq. This proposed merger will see Coincheck listed as a publicly traded entity on the Nasdaq Global Select Market under the “CNCK” ticker.



In a recent statement, THCP confirmed that it had tendered a registration statement to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) for the partnership with Coincheck. The filling, put forward by Coincheck Group B.V., covers the business details and timeframe for completion.



In the meantime, Coincheck’s collaboration with SPAC is set to be finalized between Q3 and Q4 of 2024. The proposed merger is subject to regulatory approvals and other closing clauses. 



Once finalized, Coincheck Group B.V. will be renamed Coincheck Group N.V. This will make the company a publicly traded holding company headquartered in the Netherlands, with Coincheck operating as its wholly-owned subsidiary.









Coincheck is a digital exchange platform boasting a market share of over 1.98 million accounts. At the same time, Thunder Bridge Capital Partners IV is an SPAC specializing in mergers and acquisitions within the financial sector. As such, this initiative signals Coincheck’s goal of expanding its global presence and tapping into the Nasdaq market.



In 2023, Coincheck saw a setback when its parent company, Monex Group, announced a one-year postponement in its public listing. Initially billed for completion by July 2, 2023, the anticipated union was rescheduled to July 2, 2024.



This pause was verified by Monex Group in June 2023, which confirmed an amendment to the SPAC’s certificate of incorporation during a shareholders’ meeting. Even though the reasons for the delay were undisclosed, opinions arose regarding potential hurdles in securing shareholder endorsement. This pause was the second instance Coincheck’s Nasdaq listing was postponed.

                        Democratic representatives have introduced the US Blockchain Integrity Act to tighten regulations in the cryptocurrency sphere. The act aims to crack down on cryptocurrency mixers, often utilized for illicit financial activities. Led by Sean Casten and supported by fellow Democrats, the proposed bill seeks to enact a two-year ban on cryptocurrency mixers.US Lawmakers Look to Ban Crypto MixersA crypto mixer serves as a pool, enabling users to generate new addresses and withdraw funds without disclosing the connection between the depositor and withdrawal addresses. This opacity poses a significant challenge for law enforcement agencies, hindering efforts to track fund origins and destinations and creating an avenue for unlawful activities.The proposed legislation aims to disrupt the flow of illicit funds and promote transparency by prohibiting financial institutions, cryptocurrency exchanges, and registered money service businesses from accepting funds processed through a mixer. Violations of this ban would incur civil penalties of up to $100,000, serving as a deterrent against facilitating mixer-related transactions.Additionally, the bill mandates that the Treasury Department compile a comprehensive report during the ban period evaluating various aspects of mixer transactions, including involvement in illicit finance, legitimate use cases, law enforcement capabilities, and regulatory approaches in other jurisdictions. Cryptocurrency mixers have emerged as a focal point due to their role in obscuring transaction trails and enabling user anonymity, prompting alarm among law enforcement agencies regarding their exploitation by criminals for money laundering and terrorist financing.However, the proposed ban faces political challenges, particularly within the Republican-majority House, where its passage remains uncertain. While Democrats advocate for the initiative as a necessary measure to combat illicit finance, Republicans express concerns about stifling innovation and the need for balanced regulatory oversight.Beyond legislative efforts, US authorities have previously taken action against cryptocurrency mixers, exemplified by the Treasury’s targeting of mixer service Tornado Cash and legal actions against mixer developers for money laundering and sanctions violations.Moreover, lawmakers have raised apprehensions regarding offshore-issued stablecoins like Tether, citing potential links to illicit finance. Stablecoins pegged to fiat currencies and have gained traction for facilitating transactions within the cryptocurrency ecosystem, prompting scrutiny over issuer transparency and regulatory oversight.
Crypto Mixer As a Safe Tool For Bad ActorsThe Poloniex hacker, notorious for the exchange’s security breach last year, recently funneled $3.4 million worth of Ethereum through the Tornado Cash mixer to launder the stolen funds. A report from blockchain intelligence firm Chainalysis reveals a surge in the popularity of crypto mixers in 2022, with these services receiving more cryptocurrency than ever before. According to the report, illicit addresses accounted for 23% of the funds sent to mixers in 2023, a significant increase from 12% in 2021. The rise in mixer usage is attributed to a doubling of the share of funds deemed illicit, which now represents the main driver for the uptick in mixer activity.

Trump Champions Crypto: 'I'm Good With It, Vote For Me'


								On late Wednesday, Donald Trump, the former President and Republican frontrunner, declared his support for cryptocurrencies. This announcement came during a notable gathering at his Mar-a-Lago resort in Palm Beach, Florida, dubbed the Trump Cards NFT Gala, attended by supporters who are holders of NFTs depicting Trump’s name and likeness.
During the event, Trump criticized the Biden administration’s stance on digital assets. Mimicking a conversation, he said, “If you ask Biden, sir, are you for or against crypto? What’s that? What? Get me off the stage. Now, he has no idea. But look, [he’s] very much against it. The Democrats are very much against it.”
He then aligned himself with the pro-crypto sentiment evident among the attendees, “And I say this, a lot of people are very much for it. Probably a lot of the people in this group. And I’m fine with it. I want to make sure it’s good and solid and everything else. But I’m good with it. And if you want, if you like crypto in any form, and it comes in a lot of different forms, if you’re in favor of crypto, you better vote for me.”



Trump further lamented the exodus of digital asset companies from the United States, attributing this trend to an unfriendly regulatory environment fostered by the current government. “Crypto is moving out of the US because of hostility towards crypto,” he claimed, promising to reverse this trend by creating a more welcoming regulatory framework for blockchain and digital currencies.


At the event, Trump also openly welcomed campaign donations in Bitcoin and other digital assets, signaling a major pivot in his acceptance and understanding of digital assets. When asked, “Can we donate using crypto?” Trump responded, “If you can’t, I’ll make sure you can.” This move could attract significant support from younger, tech-savvy voters who view them as a cornerstone of future financial systems.
Crypto Is A Key Issue In The 2024 US Election
Industry reactions to Trump’s statements were immediate and pointed. Ron Hammond, the government relations director at the Blockchain Association, noted the political divide, highlighting the day’s events on X: “I didn’t think crypto would be an election issue, but today’s polar opposite statements proved that. Twenty-one Democrats today voted against their own party realizing the trend: it’s a losing issue to be in the anti-army.”
Further emphasizing the community’s reaction, Dennis Porter, CEO and founder of Satoshi Act, commented via X: “Trump just said he is pro-Bitcoin/crypto. Biden (so far) squarely opposed to Bitcoin/crypto. The wildest part: I’ve been hearing rumblings that Biden may pivot on the issue.”

This sentiment reflects broader concerns about the US falling behind in the global race to embrace and regulate digital currencies. A recent poll conducted by DCG and The Harris Poll on May 7 revealed that in key battleground states, one in five voters considers Bitcoin and digital assets a significant issue for the 2024 election.
The survey underscored a significant lack of trust in current elected officials’ understanding of technologies like digital assets, with four out of five respondents expressing a desire for lawmakers to have a better grasp of the technology before attempting to regulate it.
“Half of voters (48%) distrust candidates interfering with crypto. A third (30%) are more likely to support pro-crypto politicians, and a quarter (25%) feel more trusting towards those enthusiastic about digital currencies,” DCG revealed via X.
As the 2024 Presidential race heats up, Trump’s clear pivot to pro-crypto policies could not only sway single-issue voters but also redefine Republican strategies on technology and economic innovation. With this stance, Trump is positioning himself at the forefront of what may become a central issue in the upcoming US election.
At press time, BTC traded at $61,421.

Nigeria Pushes Back Against Binance, Rejects CEO’s Bribe Claim


                        
                            Nigeria Pushes Back Against Binance, Claims CEO’s Bribe Allegation ‘Lacks Any Iota of Substance’

                        Nigeria has fired back at Binance Holdings’ bribe accusation, claiming it’s a distraction to shift focus away from the exchange’s actions.The statement on Wednesday followed Binance CEO Richard Teng’s blog post, where he accused a Nigerian government official of pressuring crypto representatives to accept a secret agreement. This agreement would supposedly settle claims the Nigerian government has against the exchange.“Teng made false allegations of bribery against unidentified Nigerian government officials who he claimed demanded $150m in cryptocurrency payments to resolve the ongoing criminal investigation against the company,” the Ministry of Information spokesman Rabiu Ibrahim said.He added that the Binance CEO’s claim “lacks any iota of substance.” He also described it as a “diversionary tactic and an attempted act of blackmail.”The exchange “will not clear its name in Nigeria by resorting to fictional claims and mudslinging media campaigns,” he added. “The only way to resolve its issues will be by submitting itself to unobstructed investigation and judicial due process.”Binance didn’t return Cryptonews’ request for comment by press time.
Binance Employees Allegedly Threatened, Offered Secret Deal
According to Teng, Nigeria’s House Committee on Financial Crimes (HCFC) threatened to arrest Binance employees and bar them from leaving the country.After leaving the HCFC meeting, unidentified individuals reportedly approached Binance employees, offering to resolve the situation through a secret payment. The New York Times reported this $150m “settlement” originated within the Nigerian government.
Detained Execs, Blocked Access
The conflict began on Feb. 26 when executives Tigran Gambaryan and Nadeem Anjarwalla traveled to Abuja to address the Binance-Nigerian government dispute. However, Gambaryan and Anjarwalla were detained in Nigeria for two weeks in March without justification and later faced money laundering and tax evasion charges.Anjarwalla escaped soon after, but was recaptured in Kenya, nearly 3,000 miles away, in late April.Nigeria’s government had ordered the country’s telecoms to block access to Binance and other cryptocurrency exchanges. They justified this action by citing concerns about the devaluation of the Nigerian currency, the naira, and alleged involvement of the exchanges in illegal money transfers.Reports indicate Nigeria’s government is angry about capital flowing out of the country due to the crypto exchange. This has worsened the African nation’s financial problems.

Trump Promises a Good Crypto Future, Seeks Crypto Enthusiasts’ Support


							

Donald Trump urges crypto enthusiasts to vote for him, assuring a good and solid crypto industry.



The former President criticizes President Joe Biden, claiming he stands against crypto even if he doesn’t know what it is.



Trump asserts that the Democrats and SEC Chair Gary Gensler are also against the crypto space.




In a recent development, former US President Donald Trump has reignited optimism in the future of crypto in the United States if he is elected in the upcoming Presidential Election. Trump highlighted the significance of regulatory clarity in the nation to promote the flourishing of the crypto industry.



The former President accused the current President, Joe Biden, and his administration of their anti-crypto stance and skepticism towards cryptocurrencies. He asserted that Biden is fighting against an entity that he doesn’t understand. He stated,




 “Biden doesn’t even know what if you ask Biden. ‘Sir, are you for or against crypto?” What’s that? What? Get me off the stage’… He has no idea, but…very much against it.”




Further, Trump directed his stark criticism towards Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) Chair Gary Gensler and the Democrats, claiming that their moves are anti-crypto. Trump assured of a potential “good and solid” crypto industry and urged the crypto enthusiasts to vote for him.










 “The Democrats are very much against it. And I say this, a lot of people are very much for it. Probably, a lot of people in this group. And I am fine with it. I want to make sure it’s good and solid and everything else. I’,m good with it…If you like crypto, in any form, and it comes in a lot of different forms. If you favor crypto, you better vote for Trump.”




Previously, Trump promised that if he becomes the next US President, he would not use regulatory authority to crack down on Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. He also discussed the recently launched expensive Trump-branded sneakers, adding, “I noticed that so many of them were paid for with this new currency.”

Top Analyst Predicts Massive Drop for Solana-Based Memecoin That’s Exploded Over 42x in Four Months - The Daily Hodl


								A widely followed crypto analyst and trader is expressing bearish sentiment on a top-50 memecoin by market cap.
The analyst pseudonymously known as Bluntz tells his 258,100 followers on the social media platform X that dogwifhat (WIF), which is built on the Solana (SOL) blockchain, could drop by around 66% from the current level.










According to Bluntz, who regularly applies the Elliott Wave theory in his technical analysis, WIF is likely in the process of completing a corrective three-pattern wave. According to the Elliott Wave theory, the main trend of the price of an asset moves in a five-wave pattern while a correction occurs in a three-wave pattern.
Based on the pseudonymous analyst’s chart, it appears that WIF could bottom out at around the $1 price before resuming an upward trend to new all-time highs.
Source: Bluntz/X
WIF, which is currently the 43rd-largest crypto asset by market capitalization, is trading at $2.94 at time of writing. The Solana-based memecoin reached a low of $0.069 on January 10, a gain of 42.61x in four months.
Besides Bluntz, the analyst pseudonymously known as Credible Crypto also says that he expects WIF, as well as other memecoins, to fall. According to Credible Crypto, WIF could drop by around 47% from the current level.
“If you still haven’t taken a look and/or refused to open your mind to the possibly of a sub $2 WIF and major drops across the board for Dogecoin (DOGE) and other memes, it’s not too late.”

Dogecoin's road ahead: Can DOGE's price hit $0.25 in May? - AMBCrypto



Dogecoin saw negative sentiment but steady social media engagements.
Liquidity clusters could be key for a DOGE reversal.

Dogecoin [DOGE] faced rejection from the local resistance zone at $0.165. This level was also the high of a range the meme coin traded within in April.
Since the high of Monday the 6th of May, DOGE has registered losses of 12%.
A recent AMBCrypto report noted that a large chunk of Dogecoin holders were still in profit. The retracement in recent weeks was deep, undoing all the gains made in the latter half of March.
Yet, the selling pressure from these holders was not as heavy as feared.
Does this mean investors are confident that Dogecoin would outperform the market?

To answer this question, AMBCrypto analyzed the social metrics from Santiment.
Investor confidence did not look hefty. It has been negative since April as prices took a turn below $0.2, turning the level to resistance.
The social dominance saw spikes, but the social volume did not change much. This too does not show bullishness but suggests that Dogecoin’s social media mentions have at least been consistent.

Looking at the on-chain metrics, we see that the daily active addresses have fallen dramatically from the February highs. It has been consistently low in the past six weeks.
This was a sign that unique addresses were not involved in transactions, which pointed toward lowered demand.
The transaction volume was relatively consistent in the first half of April. Since then, it too saw a dramatic decrease toward the end of the month.
It has recovered somewhat over the past ten days, which was encouraging, but not necessarily bullish for the token.
The dormant circulation saw a large spike on the 26th of April.
It indicated a large amount of tokens were transferred, likely for selling. Since then, the metric has been quiet, signaling muted selling pressure.
Analysis of the liquidity chart pointed to the next direction for DOGE

The cumulative liquidation levels delta was highly negative. This showed that short liquidations outweighed long liquidations by a considerable amount.
In turn, we can expect prices to climb higher to wipe out these liquidations.

This might come after the nearest pockets of liquidity at $0.147 and $0.144 are taken out.
Hence, scalp traders would want to see a move into this $0.144 liquidity cluster followed by a bullish short-term reversal toward $0.155-$0.16.

US Presidential Candidate Donald Trump Promises "Full Support" for Cryptocurrencies! - Bitcoin Sistemi

Former US President Donald Trump, who is a candidate again in the 2024 US Presidential elections, continues to come to the fore with his positive statements about Bitcoin (BTC) and cryptocurrencies.
At this point, in his previous statements, he stated that he accepted the popularity of Bitcoin and announced his support for the cryptocurrency industry.



Finally, Trump reiterated his support for the cryptocurrency industry and announced that he would accept cryptocurrency donations in his election campaign.
Meeting with investors who bought NFTs, Trump said:






“You cannot donate cryptocurrency during the election campaign, but I will change this. I will make cryptocurrency donations possible.
Can we donate to the Trump campaign using crypto? “I believe the answer to the question is yes.”

“Joe Biden Doesn't Know What Cryptocurrency is!”
Donald Trump, who also criticized his rival in the presidential elections, Joe Biden, said that Biden does not even know what cryptocurrency is.

“He doesn't even know what cryptocurrency is.
“If you love crypto in any way and support crypto, you better vote for Trump.”

Trump, who also criticized Biden and the administration's anti-cryptocurrency attitude, added that he would not allow the cryptocurrency industry to leave the United States. Promising to do his best to keep the crypto industry in the USA, Trump said: “If the cryptocurrency industry is leaving the USA due to the hostility of Biden and his administration, we will stop it. Because we do not want this. If we are going to adopt crypto, we must allow them to be in the USA.” said.


Trump's latest statements regarding BTC show that he has backtracked on his previous statements in 2021, in which he called Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies a “scam” competing against the dollar.

CryptoPunks led the market despite a 25% sales drop from the day prior. Its US$1.7 million daily sales volume also led the market on Tuesday, according to CryptoSlam data.



CryptoPunks’ two-day dominance was not able to keep Ethereum, its host chain, at the top of the blockchain rankings for NFT sales. Bitcoin collections collectively achieved US$6.68 million in sales on Wednesday, edging out Ethereum’s US$6.04 million.

	
	
	
	


The second-highest performing collection of the day was DMarket, with a daily sales volume of US$725,058, involving a staggering 4,147 unique buyers and 3,569 sellers across 31,734 transactions. 



DMarket is a NFT collection that represents in-game items for the Mythos chain.



NodeMonkes on Bitcoin claimed the third spot with a daily sales volume of US$717,301.84, engaging 37 unique buyers and 35 sellers in 38 transactions. This is a slight decrease from the US$750,024.31 generated the day before. The collection’s all-time sales now stand at US$214.35 million, reflecting a strong market position.



NodeMonkes is the all-time leading collection on the Bitcoin network, with US$214.5 million in sales. It is now about US$1 million away from overtaking CyberKongz, an Ethereum-based collection that currently holds the 26th spot on the all-time sales chart.

	
	
	

	


Other notable collections that made Wednesday’s top 10 sales list include the $PMPS BRC-20 NFTs, which saw a daily sales volume of US$634,465, and Mad Lads, which generated US$518,697 in sales. 



Both collections experienced fluctuations in their daily performance, with $PMPS BRC-20 NFTs witnessing an increase in transactions from the previous day, while Mad Lads saw a decrease in sales from US$800,760.



Solana Monkey Business, Bored Ape Yacht Club, Mutant Ape Yacht Club, DogeZuki Collection, and Guild of Guardians Avatars also featured in the day’s top-performing NFT collections

Solana drops 5% on new FTX plan, quick rebound to wipe $125M shorts

Solana dropped 5% in a day amid further FTX sell-off concerns, and current trader positions suggest $125 million is in jeopardy if it were to bounce back as it has in recent times. The price decline comes alongside a 40% decrease in open interest (OI) of Solana’s (SOL) over the last 30 days, down to $1.78 billion on May 9, according to CoinGlass data.The steep decline in OI typically signals that traders are uncertain about the cryptocurrency and are not confident in taking positions on the asset’s price.However, Solana has a recent knack for recovering quickly from its dips, which, as of now, could jeopardize over a hundred million dollars in short positions.Over the past 30 days, Solana has seen periods where its price has dipped and recovered 5% within 24 hours.On April 19, Solana saw a similar 5% decrease before quickly recovering to $157 within hours, just ahead of the Bitcoin halving on April 20.Similarly, if Solana’s price rises 5% to regain its May 7 price of $157, $125 million in short positions will be liquidated.Solana has a significant amount of short positions at risk if it rebounds back to $157. Source: CoinGlassJust days before Solana dipped on May 7, pseudonymous crypto trader CryptoAce told his 13,400 followers on X that Solana’s price was “inside the resistance box” and accurately predicted that a rejection would lead to a drop toward the $142.50 level.However, Solana’s most recent fall may be attributed to FTX announcing on the same day that it had adequate funds to repay victims of the exchange’s collapse once it sold off its assets — a large portion of those being Solana.Related: Solana-to-Bitcoin cross-chain bridge aims for Q3 2024 launchThis comes alongside a drop in the overall cryptocurrency market sentiment, as the Fear and Greed Index score fell by 13 points over the past 24 hours, dipping to a score of 54 on May 9.However, new findings in the ongoing competition between Solana and Ethereum may have also impacted its price in the short term.On May 8, Cointelegraph reported on claims that the Solana network could be on track to overtake the Ethereum network in transaction fees, which could be a positive news indicator that Solana needs for a price spike.On May 7, Solana’s total economic value of $2.8 million was close to Ethereum’s $3.1 million total economic value.Magazine: What do crypto market makers actually do?

                        2024 US Presidential hopeful Donald Trump isn’t much interested in “Jeo Boden (BODEN)” memecoin, a joke crypto token mimicking the current President Joe Biden.Former President Trump, answering to his fan questions, mocked the memecoin after hearing that the token reached $240 million market-cap.“That’s a lot of money for a coin, I don’t like that investment,” he noted.His remarks came during a special Trump NFT event for holders held at his Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida on Wednesday.Last month, Solana-based memecoins representing caricatures of Biden and Trump, posted massive gains, according to blockchain data from DexScreener.Crypto tokens referring to a misspelling of both the candidates – “Jeo Boden” and “Doland Tremp” – went head-to-head with trading. At a point, “Jeo Boden” and “Doland Tremp” saw market capitalization of $473 million and $83 million, respectively.Memecoins have received popularity on the Solana blockchain in recent times, thanks to its speed and low transaction costs. SOL-based memecoins have a combined market capitalization of $7.31 billion at press time, per CoinGecko data.The embattled former leader is also open to crypto donations for campaign. When asked by the mob, “Can we donate using crypto?” Trump noted, “If you can’t, I’ll make sure you can.”Boden memecoin Jumps 25%
Following Trump’s remarks, Boden memecoin saw a 25% raise in its price on Wednesday. After peaking $0.43, the price quickly fell to $0.366. The token is still up 15% and is trading at the same price at the time of writing.As their names suggests, memecoins are crypto tokens inspired by internet memes and jokes, along with public figures. These tokens mainly get value from linking with events of popular people. These coins are also highly volatile and tend to rapidly lose value after its launch.Recently, a trader pseudonymous to Crypto Dog predicted that the memecoin Jeo Boden is on the cusp of breaking out after a period of consolidation. The memecoin has witnessed a remarkable twenty-fold surge since the beginning of March.

Bitcoin at $61K: Are investors losing interest? THIS is a worrying sign - AMBCrypto



Bitcoin’s price fell as the rate of accumulation across all cohorts slowed down.
Addresses were largely unprofitable and had low incentives to sell their holdings.

Bitcoin [BTC] fell towards the $61,000 mark at press time, causing a surge in skepticism amongst holders and traders alike.
Accumulation on a hold
One of the reasons for the same would be the declining accumulation for BTC observed across the board. This trend began in May, which coincided with a local price bottom for Bitcoin.
Over the past 30 days, all cohorts combined have added roughly 10,000 Bitcoin to their holdings. This paled in comparison to the 19,000 new Bitcoins that were created in that same period.
It was the smaller investors, often referred to as shrimps, who were leading the accumulation effort.
Source: X
The decline in accumulation of BTC may result in price declines at worst and price stagnation at best.
If addresses continue to HODL their BTC, despite market fluctuations, the price of BTC could remain the same and may not see red for the foreseeable future.
What will holders do?
One of the things that would dictate the behavior of these holders would be their profitability. AMBCrypto’s analysis of Santiment’s data revealed that the MVRV ratio for BTC had remained in the red.
This indicated that most BTC addresses were holding their coins at a loss. Most addresses would be willing to wait before their BTC turns profitable before selling their holdings.
Another key factor that will play a role in determining the behavior of holders would be the Long/Short ratio. Over the past month, the Long/Short ratio for BTC had fallen significantly.
A waning Long/Short ratio indicated that short-term holders were slowly starting to outnumber long-term holders at the time of writing.

Read Bitcoin’s [BTC] Price Prediction 2024-25

These short-term holders are much more likely to panic sell their holdings at times of market uncertainty and may add to the selling pressure faced by BTC.
Source: Santiment
At the time of writing, BTC was trading at $61,533.04 and its price had fallen by 1.50% in the last 24 hours. Moreover, its trading volume had declined by 1.77%.

Listing of Exodus Exchange Postponed Until SEC Review


							

The listing of crypto exchange Exodus has been postponed.



The listing process will resume once the SEC completes the firm’s review.



The trading of the exchange’s Class A common stock was scheduled for May 9.




Exodus Movement, Inc. announced today that the NYSE American has postponed the listing of its shares until the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) completes its review of Exodus’ registration statement, which became effective on April 28, 2024. 



Initially, the NYSE American had approved Exodus’ Class A common stock for listing, with trading set to start on May 9, 2024.



The delay in listing comes as a surprise to Exodus, which had been transparent and responsive throughout the process. CEO JP Richardson expressed optimism that the SEC would adhere to the law and resolve the matter promptly. Until then, Exodus’ Common Stock will continue trading on the OTC Markets’ OTCQX exchange under the symbol “EXOD.”



Richardson reassured current stockholders that no action is required on their part. He emphasized that despite the setback, Exodus remains committed to providing excellent service and value to its customers and shareholders.



The decision to postpone the listing raises questions about the reasons behind the delay and the potential impact on Exodus’ future plans. However, the company remains hopeful that it will eventually be listed on a national securities exchange once the SEC completes its review.









Exodus, a leading provider of cryptocurrency wallets and digital asset management tools, seeks to expand its presence in the blockchain industry. The delay in its listing does not diminish its achievements or its commitment to delivering top-notch services to its users, stated the release.



As per the release, the delay was unexpected. However, Exodus remains confident in its ability to navigate regulatory processes and emerge stronger. The company’s determination to uphold transparency and compliance reflects its long-term vision for success in the cryptocurrency market.

Crypto Privacy Services are on the Decline with LocalMonero Closing | Coin Insider


Key Takeaways:Regulatory pressure: Increased regulatory scrutiny of cryptocurrency exchanges and services, particularly those focusing on privacy, has made it challenging for platforms like LocalMonero to operate. Compliance with stringent regulations often requires significant resources, which smaller platforms may need help allocating.Centralisation risks: The closure of LocalMonero underscores the risks associated with centralised platforms in the cryptocurrency space. Centralised exchanges and services are vulnerable to regulatory actions, hacking, and other operational risks. As a result, users seeking privacy may turn to decentralised alternatives to mitigate these risks.Privacy concerns: The decline of LocalMonero also raises concerns about privacy in cryptocurrency transactions. While some users prioritise privacy features, others may be deterred by the risks associated with using platforms like LocalMonero. This tension between privacy and compliance will likely shape the regulatory landscape for cryptocurrency services.In a recent blow to the crypto community, LocalMonero, a prominent peer-to-peer exchange platform facilitating Monero transactions, has announced its closure. The platform stated that all new signups and advertisement postings for Monero trades were disabled. The report suggested that the platform will disable the trading of the privacy-focused crypto asset on May 14 2024.As regulatory pressures mount and mainstream platforms eschew anonymity features, users seeking privacy-centric solutions find themselves with dwindling options. The firm noted, “A combination of internal and external factors but did not reveal the specific reasons for its closure… The website will be taken down, and users will be advised to reclaim any funds from their wallet before that date; otherwise, they may be considered abandoned.” The P2P Monero trading platform suggested that the Monero ecosystem has matured significantly. Regulatory Headwinds and Compliance ChallengesIn part, LocalMonero’sLocalMonero’s closure can be attributed to the increasingly stringent regulatory environment surrounding cryptocurrencies. Governments worldwide are cracking down on anonymity features, viewing them as facilitators of illicit activities such as money laundering and terrorism financing. Compliance with Know Your Customer (KYC) and Anti-Money Laundering (AML) regulations has become a non-negotiable requirement for crypto businesses, imposing significant operational burdens. Navigating these compliance challenges likely became unsustainable for LocalMonero.Faced with the prospect of regulatory scrutiny and potential legal liabilities, the decision to shut down may have seemed inevitable. According to some, the move has been seen as another blow to privacy coins and protocols following Kraken’s termination support for Monero, its customers based in Ireland and Belgium in April, and recent legal action against Tornado Cash. In a post on X Privacy Advocate, Seth mentioned it was a sad day. Seth said, “LocalMonero has been a cornerstone of the no-KYC Monero ecosystem, and there is no direct fiat to the XMR alternative today.”  Seth highlighted that although the platform did not provide a reason for users to speculate.Mainstream Adoption and the Erosion of PrivacyThe rise of mainstream crypto exchanges, characterised by platforms like Coinbase and Binance, has marginalised privacy-oriented services like LocalMonero. These mainstream exchanges prioritise compliance and user identification, aligning themselves closely with traditional financial institutions. While this approach fosters broader adoption and institutional investment, it comes at the expense of privacy. Moreover, regulatory pressures have compelled major exchanges to delist privacy coins like Monero, citing concerns about their anonymity features. This increases the challenges faced by privacy-conscious users, pushing them towards niche platforms that regulators increasingly target. The erosion of privacy within the crypto ecosystem reflects broader societal trends towards increased surveillance and data collection. As governments and corporations tighten their grip on personal information, the demand for privacy-enhancing technologies becomes more pronounced. Despite the setbacks experienced by LocalMonero and other privacy-focused projects, the quest for financial privacy remains alive within the crypto community. Innovations such as zero-knowledge proofs and decentralised exchanges offer promising avenues for preserving anonymity without sacrificing compliance. Projects like Tornado Cash and Wasabi Wallet are pioneering privacy solutions for Ethereum (ETH) and Bitcoin (BTC), respectively, demonstrating that privacy and transparency coexist within the blockchain ecosystem. Achieving widespread adoption of privacy-enhancing technologies requires a concerted effort from developers, regulators, and users alike. Regulatory frameworks must balance combating illicit activities and preserving individual privacy rights. Likewise, developers must prioritise usability and accessibility to ensure privacy solutions are not confined to the tech-savvy elite.

Analyst Explains Declining Japanese Yen Could Be Bullish for Bitcoin, Here's How | Coinspeaker



Amid the uncertainty in the traditional market, and the condition of broken money, people are more like to move towards Bitcoin and other crypto altcoins, says analyst. 

The global macro developments have sent jitters across the broader cryptocurrency market leading to increased volatility. In an interesting analysis, a Swan Bitcoin executive stated that a declining Japanese Yen could be a boon for Bitcoin, even if it ends up as a “disaster” for US Treasuries.
Over the last 30 days, the Japanese Yen has lost 2.9% of its value with 1JPY currently having a value of 0.0064 USD. In an episode of Bitcoin Daily on Wednesday, May 8, Swan Bitcoin head of business Dante Cook explained:




“This spells disaster for Japan and the US potentially, as Japan is the largest holder of US treasuries, only 4% of its forex reserves are in gold, the rest are almost exclusively in US Treasuries.”
Cook stated that Japan has no option but to sell its US Treasury holdings in order to “prop up its currency” unless the US government comes up with backdoor liquidity or with a swap line agreement for the two central banks to exchange the currencies.
He suggests that the sell-off could trigger uncertainty in traditional securities, potentially paving the way for a significant influx of liquidity into the market. This surge in liquidity might favor Bitcoin as investors explore safer, alternative stores of value.
Bitcoin has already been enjoying a massive liquidity influx from institutional investors ever since the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) gave the nod for the trading of 11 spot Bitcoin ETFs in the country.
According to Farside data, the 11 spot Bitcoin ETFs have collectively experienced total net inflows amounting to $11.78 billion since their inception. Presently, Bitcoin is trading at $61,680, marking a 7.45% increase over the past week.
Investing in Bitcoin and Altcoins
Cook added that the current uncertainty in the traditional financial market could push more and more people toward using Bitcoin as well as investing in other riskier crypto altcoins. “Since the money is broken, more and more people are turning to gambling,” he claimed.
Additionally, Cook highlighted VanEck, a spot Bitcoin ETF provider, noting its relatively lackluster performance in the ETF competition but its recent introduction of the MarketVector MEMECOIN index.
“It’s somewhat surprising that an institution would provide this to retail customers, yet not entirely unexpected,” he remarked, emphasizing the ongoing uncertainty within traditional financial markets.

Flying Pepe (FLYPEPE) to Surge 6,400% Ahead of MEXC Listing, While Bonk and Dogecoin Struggle



                    

Flying Pepe (FLYPEPE) could turn early investors into multi-millionaires if it becomes a mainstream coin, like Bonk (BONK) and Dogecoin (DOGE).



Flying Pepe (FLYPEPE), a new Solana memecoin that was launched this week, is poised to explode over 6,400% in price in the coming days.




This is because FLYPEPE has announced its first centralized exchange listing, which will be on MEXC.



This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up.



Currently, Flying Pepe can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jupiter and Raydium, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days.




Early investors in BONK and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Flying Pepe could become the next viral memecoin.



To buy Flying Pepe on Raydium or Jupiter ahead of the MEXC listing, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Flying Pepe by entering its contract address – 65orYrJbQxa5BZUWyeCsDtJC7JZg8zQYcvRZpvnnd5eq – in the receiving field.



In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Bonk (BONK) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price.



If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner.




The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Bonk (BONK), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum.



This is why many BONK, DOGE, and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like FLYPEPE.

Over $20M in bridged Ether returned to ZKasino wallet - Crypto Briefing




In a surprising turn of events, more than $20 million worth of bridged Ether has been mysteriously returned to the multisignature wallet of blockchain-based gambling project ZKasino, nearly three weeks after users accused the platform’s founders of orchestrating an exit scam.On May 9, an X feed dedicated to recovering funds from the ZKasino exit scam reported that almost $21 million worth of wstETH (wrapped Lido staking ETH) had been transferred back to the project’s multisignature wallet. This development has led some to believe that investors may soon receive their funds as originally promised by the project.The returned 6,021 wstETH equates to approximately two-thirds of the amount that went missing during the alleged heist, prompting speculation about whether the scammers are preparing to refund the victims. ZKasino had launched on April 20, offering an airdrop in its native token ZKAS to users who bridged ETH to the platform, with the promise of returning the ETH.However, instead of honoring this commitment, the gambling project moved around $33 million worth of users’ bridged Ethereum to the staking protocol Lido Finance.The incident led to accusations of an exit scam or rug pull, as more than 10,000 people had bridged assets based on the protocol’s pledges, which they claim were later broken. On April 29, Dutch authorities arrested a 26-year-old man suspected of being involved in the alleged ZKasino scam, seizing around $12.2 million worth of cryptocurrencies, real estate, and luxury cars from the suspect.Despite the arrest, illicit funds continue to move on-chain, suggesting that other potential attackers may remain at large. However, the recent movement of funds back to the project’s multisig wallet has renewed hope for the victims.According to figures from onchain intelligence firm CertiK, April saw $25.7 million worth of crypto lost to scams and hacks, not including the ZKasino incident. This is the lowest historical figure since 2021, when the firm began tracking the data.

Unpacking XRP's Potential 650x Surge And What It Means


                            Ripples of uncertainty continue to surround XRP, the cryptocurrency created by Ripple Labs. Once a high-flyer, XRP has seen its price plummet amidst a protracted legal battle with the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). But even as dark clouds loom, some analysts see a silver lining, predicting a future surge for the digital asset.

A Legal Tug-of-War Dampens XRP Price
The SEC lawsuit, filed in December 2020, alleges that the altcoin is an unregistered security. This classification, if upheld, could severely restrict XRP’s trading and dampen its value. The legal wrangling has taken its toll, with its price dropping a staggering 85% from its 2018 peak of $3.41. The recent months haven’t offered much respite, with XRP experiencing a near 18% decline in the last month alone.
Technical Indicators Flash Red In The Short Term
Technical analysis, a method used to predict price movements based on historical data, paints a concerning picture for XRP in the immediate future. Analysts point to recent price chart breakdowns, suggesting continued downward pressure.

A Bullish Case For XRP
Despite the current headwinds, some analysts remain optimistic about the coin’s long-term prospects. Armando Pantoja, a well-respected crypto analyst, believes XRP has the potential to reach between $8 and $20 by 2026. This would represent a phenomenal increase of up to 3,558% from its current price.

Pantoja bases his bullish prediction on several factors. He points to XRP’s historical performance, highlighting its meteoric rise in 2017, where it surged over 650 times to its peak. This, according to Pantoja, serves as a precedent for future growth.
Institutional Adoption
Another factor fueling optimism is Ripple’s growing list of partnerships with established financial institutions. Integration with giants like Bank of America and Royal Bank of Canada could significantly boost the altcoin’s value by increasing its utility and mainstream adoption. Recent collaborations with HashKey DX and SBI Ripple Asia further bolster the case for institutional acceptance, potentially propelling XRP’s price upwards.

XRP market cap currently at $28.7 billion. Chart: TradingView.com
Upgrades To The XRP Ledger
Ripple hasn’t been sitting idle either. Through its development arm, RippleX, the company has introduced key upgrades to the XRP Ledger (XRPL), the technology that underpins XRP. Notably, the XLS-68d specification allows platforms to cover transaction fees for users without distributing free coins. This simplifies the onboarding process and could attract new users to the XRP ecosystem.
Market Trends And Community Optimism
Pantoja also emphasizes broader market trends that could benefit XRP. The increasing demand for efficient financial services could create a perfect storm for XRP’s adoption. Additionally, Pantoja anticipates a legal victory for Ripple, paving the way for further partnerships and market expansion.

The XRP community itself seems to echo this optimism. Social media engagement surrounding the altcoin has spiked, and the number of total holders and active addresses continues to rise. This suggests that despite the current challenges, many investors remain confident in XRP’s long-term potential.

Floki, A Crypto Named After Elon Musk's Dog, Becomes Title Sponsor For An International Sports Tournament: What You Need To Know - Benzinga

Floki FLOKI/USD was trading in the green at the time of writing, going against the broader meme market trend which saw powerhouses like Dogecoin DOGE/USD and Shiba Inu SHIB/USD shed value in the last 24 hours. A new sports partnership might be fueling the surge. What Happened: The dog-themed project announced getting chosen as the title sponsor of the upcoming 3-match Cricket Men's series between Ireland and Pakistan beginning Friday.  The strategic tie-up reflected the project's growing mainstream penetration, especially in the sporting landscape. “It is with great enthusiasm that we at FLOKI step into a partnership with Irish cricket, an arena where the sport’s heart beats as fervently as our dedication to being a cryptocurrency for all," Floki's media representative said. As part of the deal, the logos of FLOKi, the utility token of the ecosystem, and its sister project TokenFi's TOKEN TOKEN/USD will be placed on ground perimeter boards, sightscreens, boundary ropes, and logo mats. Floki expected the brand’s exposure to reach 80 million global viewers. Why It Matters: This was not the first time Floki pursued partnerships in Cricket–a sport hugely popular in Asia, Australia, and the U.K. In November 2023, Floki announced a brand sponsorship deal with two franchise teams playing the Indian Legends League tournament. These endeavors signified a dedicated push by cryptocurrency projects to boost brand awareness and adoption among sports enthusiasts. Named after Tesla and Space X CEO Elon Musk's Shiba Inu dog, Floki has tried to rise above the narrow contours of meme coins, looking for ways to add utility to its token. It has an operational staking service, allowing users to deposit their FLOKI tokens and earn yields. About $409 million in FLOKIs was locked as of this writing, according to the official staking portal. It also launched an asset tokenization platform, TokenFi to grab a slice of the growing real-world tokenization industryPrice Action: FLOKI was trading at $0.0001767 at the time of publication, rising 2.84% in the last 24 hours, according to Benzinga Pro. It has jumped more than 400% on an annual basisRead Next: This Ethereum Killer Is Defying Gravity Amid Downturn In Major Crypto Prices — Are We Getting Ready For A ‘Parabolic Bull Run?’

Trump's Latest Campaign Strategy: Open to Crypto Donations


Former US President Donald Trump has announced that his presidential campaign will now accept cryptocurrency donations. Trump made the announcement during a special event for holders of his “Mugshot Edition” non-fungible tokens (NFTs) at his Mar-a-Lago residence in Florida.
Trump’s move highlights his ongoing engagement with cutting-edge technology and digital assets. In a broader context, this also marks a significant shift in political fundraising strategies and aligns with growing digital trends.
From NFTs to Crypto: Trump’s Digital Campaign Trail
The revelation came through a short video released by Frank DeGods, co-founder of the DeGods and y00ts projects. In the video, Trump confidently responds to a question about crypto donations.

“If you can’t, I’ll make sure you can. Can we donate to the Trump campaign using crypto? I believe the answer is yes,” Trump answered.

Although this bold declaration has spread across various social media platforms, especially X (formerly Twitter), it still awaits more details from Trump’s campaign staff.
Continuing his dialogue on the subject, Trump addressed concerns about the US regulatory environment. Some believe this environment is driving crypto entrepreneurs offshore.
When Malcolm, Chief of Staff at De Labs (DeGods and y00ts parent company), questioned how he plans to handle the exodus of American crypto players, Trump labeled the current regulatory measures as “hostility.” He also promised a more welcoming approach.


“We’ll stop it because I don’t want that. If we’re going to embrace it, we have to let them [crypto industry players] be here,” Trump asserted.

Post-announcement, meme coins linked to political figures experienced a surge in their market value. These include Doland Tremp (TREMP) and Jeo Boden (BODEN). TREMP notably rose from 0.0017 Solana (SOL) to 0.0047 SOL (approximately from $0.24 to $0.67) before settling at 0.0041 SOL (~$0.59).

Trump’s move to host this dinner garnered attention from many, particularly after a legal testimony on Tuesday. Trump even told reporters he wanted to campaign instead of being tied up in a courtroom. However, it seems that the dinner announcement was not made public and was circulated to certain invitees.
In a broader context, Trump’s positive stance on cryptocurrency suggests his potential presidency could foster a more favorable regulatory climate for cryptocurrencies in the US. Market analysts speculate this could invite more global investment in digital currencies, possibly enhancing their value and prominence.

Boom di acquisti di crypto in Brasile

According to what was revealed a few days ago by a Brazilian economic newspaper (Valor Economico), there has been a real boom in crypto purchases in Brazil.
The newspaper quotes an official report from the Brazilian central bank (Banco Central do Brasil, BCB) that collected data from 2023 and the first quarter of 2024 regarding exports and imports. 

The boom of crypto purchases in Brazil in 2023/2024
Within the category of imports, in the BCB report, there is a subcategory dedicated to crypto assets. 
In fact, the cryptocurrencies purchased by Brazilians on foreign exchanges are considered imports in all respects, as they constitute outflows of money from Brazil to abroad.
Valor Economico reports that, according to what was stated in the central bank’s report, in 2023 cryptocurrency imports in Brazil reached a total value of $12.3 billion, and in the first three months of 2024 they have increased even more. 
Indeed, in the 12 months ended in March, they rose to 14.8 billion dollars, with an increase of 20%. 
The absolute monthly record was recorded in the month of March, when Bitcoin reached a new all-time high value: 1.75 billion dollars of crypto imports in Brazil in just one month.
Although these numbers may not seem particularly high when compared to the $60 billion daily trading volumes worldwide, it is important to remember that Brazil is not among the wealthiest countries in the world. 
The situation in Brazil
Although the country has about 220 million inhabitants, which places it in seventh place in the world in terms of population, its GDP per capita is only in 58th place in the world. 
As a whole, Brazil produces more GDP than Canada, Russia, or Australia, but these are all countries with much fewer inhabitants. 
In other words, Brazil is in the top 10 of the largest countries in the world by GDP mainly due to its large population. 
Considering instead the GDP per capita, it turns out to be worse off than Turkmenistan, Montenegro, and Argentina, and much worse off, for example, than Mexico or Bulgaria. 
In other words, on average, Brazilians are not rich at all, so it is likely that they do not have many funds to invest in financial markets. 
As for their currency, the Brazilian Real, its value has remained fairly stable since the beginning of the pandemic in 2020 until today. 
Even inflation in Brazil is only slightly elevated, with a 3.9% in March that is almost in line with that of more advanced economies. 
So at an economic-financial level, there don’t seem to be any particular reasons that could push Brazilians to turn to crypto markets. 
The issue of recent crypto purchases in Brazil
Moreover, the sensational data from March 2024, regarding crypto imports in Brazil, turned out to be even 118% higher than that of March 2023, so it was a real boom, driven by the crypto bull run. 
At this point, one might think that the underlying reason could be FOMO, namely the search for quick and easy gains in the short term driven by the enthusiasm of the bull run. 
Valor Economico reports that there are economists who believe that the fact that Brazilians have purchased more cryptocurrencies is due to the fact that they have paid more attention to the good performance of Bitcoin and have tried to take advantage of it. 
According to the chief strategist of Warren Investimentos, Sérgio Goldenstein, this volume of cryptocurrency imports is not negligible at all, and indeed should be considered a very significant number for Brazil, which weighs on the trade balance with foreign countries.
In total, in March 2024, Brazil imported goods from abroad for a total value of 20.5 billion, so the 1.75 billion dollars of crypto imports actually had a significant weight. 
The volumes exported were instead almost 28 billion dollars, moreover significantly higher compared to February, so the crypto import actually did not put the country’s trade balance in crisis. 
The possible solution
However, the real problem could lie in the eventual solution adopted by the Brazilian government to contain or try to reduce these outflows of capital abroad. 
If on one hand the optimal solution could be to favor national exchanges and miners, it is more likely instead that any initiative could go in the direction of greater control of exported capital. 
So it can be imagined that the government may want to impose limitations, in order to contain or reduce the sending of capital to foreign exchanges to purchase cryptocurrencies. 
However, we must also take into account two other factors. 
The first is that the boom may have stopped for now, since from March the price of BTC and the crypto markets as a whole have stopped growing. However, nothing excludes the possibility that they may start growing again, perhaps in the second half of the year. 
The second is that, on the contrary, if overall Brazilian crypto trading were to produce profits, the exported capital could potentially return in the near future, theoretically even in greater quantities. 
In this second case, however, it must be remembered that generally retail investors and speculators often lose, so the capital returns generated from any gains could be much less than those spent on purchasing cryptocurrencies. 
At this point, it is reasonable to expect sooner or later some sort of crackdown by the Brazilian government on foreign crypto exchanges.

April Crypto Trading Volume Drops for First Time in Seven Months to $6.58T

“This decline followed unexpected macroeconomic data, an escalation in the geopolitical crisis in the Middle East, and negative net flows from U.S. spot bitcoin ETFs, leading to major crypto assets retracing the gains they made in March,” CCData said in a report shared with CoinDesk.

Ethereum ETF: Grayscale Boss Optimistic Ahead of Major SEC Decision


Grayscale CEO Michael Sonnenshein is reportedly "optimistic" about Ethereum ETF approval prospects. The head of the latest cryptocurrency asset manager expects the agency to do "the right thing."As reported by U.Today, Grayscale recently withdrew its Ethereum futures ETF application after it was delayed in November. According to ETF analyst James Seyffart, it was a Trojan horse filing that was meant to get a 19b-4 order from the SEC.However, according to multiple analysts, Grayscale's withdrawal likely means that it is not going to pursue another lawsuit against the SEC. Last August, Grayscale scored a massive victory against the agency, which eventually paved the way for the approval of a slew of Bitcoin ETFs in January.Grayscale's GBTC recently recorded its first days of inflows after months of non-stop bleeding. Despite the success of Bitcoin ETFs, the consensus appears to be that the SEC will shoot down several Ethereum ETF applications this March based on the complete lack of engagement with ETF issuers.  Recently, key Ethereum backer Consensys, which is helmed by Ethereum co-founder Joseph Lubin, took the SEC to court over its attempt to label the leading altcoin as a security. In late April, Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs started trading in Hong Kong, but their debut was rather underwhelming.

Qubic is Unleashing the Power of Mining to Solve Real-World AI Problems - A Deep Dive | Cryptopolitan

Traditional Proof-of-Work tokenomics have demonstrably shown that the strong incentives generated by mining activity have successfully attracted massive investments in hardware and technological infrastructure, leading to a significant increase in computational power. Given the current challenge of dominating AI R&D, which is heavily reliant on computational power and hardware aggregation, Qubic’s protocol offers an elegant solution. It proposes to repurpose the massive investments in hardware, time, and energy currently used by mining in networks like Bitcoin, towards dominating the AI market.Users will be able to use a distributed supercomputer to run complex simulations, train & test machine learning models. This approach targets leading firms like Meta, Google, Microsoft, and Apple, with the potential to disrupt the current AI status quo, towards more fair, transparent & secure systems that could benefit us all. Qubic’s Useful Proof of Work Solves Real-World Problems Using AIProof of work is a consensus mechanism that powers commonly known blockchains like Bitcoin. Ethereum also used the same mechanism until 15th September, 2022, after which it moved to Proof of Stake.But let’s stick to Proof of Work for a moment. This consensus mechanism is based on an effort and reward system. In that sense, it relies on a competitive process in which miners use computational power to solve complex puzzles and validate blocks. Doing so gives them a reward, and it is commonly referred to as mining. However, it uses massive amounts of energy due to high computational requirements, and is considered unsustainable in the long-term.Qubic brings a rather useful PoW mechanism in which complex mathematical puzzles are replaced by AI training tasks. Validators aka Computors on the network are backed by AI miners and they help research new paradigms for training AI models.This can potentially consume less energy per computational unit. That is because AI training can possibly run on normal hardware and does not necessarily require massive rigs. The term useful here means that all the computational power that goes wasted in traditional Proof of Work can now be utilized to research Artificially General Intelligence that can potentially resolve real-world problems in the future. At the same time, the AI training maintains the decentralization of the network as every AI miner competes to solve the training tasks. Reducing Execution Times of Smart Contracts to Mere SecondsWe know that traditionally, smart contracts are written in programming languages like Solidity and Vyper, and get executed on virtual machines. For example, Ethereum smart contracts get executed on EVM (Ethereum Virtual Machine). But one of the biggest disadvantages of virtual machines is that execution of smart contracts can be slow. Of course, one can optimize the code and achieve better execution times. But regardless of that, there’s a limit to how fast the code can execute. Qubic takes a different approach to enhance the speed of smart contracts. Its smart contracts are written in C++ instead. They’re fast, and turing-complete. This binary approach helps reduce the execution times of smart contracts to mere seconds by allowing more efficient utilization of computing power. Feeless TransactionsHigh transaction fees is another major hurdle that prevents people from using cryptocurrencies for everyday transactions. Let’s look at the average transaction fee on Ethereum. Average transaction fee on Ethereum (Source: TheBlock)From being sub 1 cent in July 2017, the fee went up to $53 in November 2021. Since then, it hasn’t been less than a dollar. Of course, we have other chains like Solana and Matic that have low transaction fees and higher speeds. Still, it is rare to come across a network promising feeless transfers. But Qubic features feeless transfers and sets itself apart. The commission size for executing smart contracts is set by the Computors in Qubic’s system based on votes by Quorum. After that, it is burned to regulate deflation and inflation. What is Aigarth? Features of Qubic’s AigarthAigarth is Qubic´s spearhead. All the information received from hundreds of thousands of miners & oracles bringing real world data on the Qubic network feeds Qubic´s collective intelligence platform, setting the base for a future Artificial General Intelligence. In order to use this collective intelligence, the Aigarth end users need to pay with QUBIC, which will afterwards get burned, triggering a deflationary process in the ecosystemTokenomics ModelQubic employs a unique tokenomics model. Its ecosystem is driven by QUBIC, which is not only a monetary unit in the traditional sense, but can also be seen as computational energy units. These units get consumed (aka burned) for certain activities such as executing smart contracts. While they have monetary value, they are not directly paid to the miners in this system. Once burned, the QUBIC units get entirely removed from the supply.1 trillion QUBIC units get generated in every epoch spanning 1 week. These are distributed among the fixed 676 network validators, called Computors, on the network one week later. This means that the max number of QUBIC that a Computor can possibly receive as revenue is 1.479 billion. Every epoch has 676 spots available for validators, and each week the validators are chosen based on competition. In each epoch, 226 spots can be replaced, and a validator’s spot is determined based on the score of mining solutions. In theory each spot in the network can become a mining pool. To be considered, the validator needs to participate in a qualifying round spanning one week, in which no QUBIC units get generated. However, that is only applicable if all Computors are operating at maximum efficiency. In real scenarios, not all Computors will be fully efficient and the inefficient ones will receive less QUBIC per epoch. Any remaining QUBIC units will get assigned to the Arbitrator.The Arbitrator has a set of duties to perform, including resolving disputes, and publishing the list of Computors in every epoch. On the other hand, Computors ensure that the consensus is reached and execute smart contracts. At the same time, they also vote by Quorum to decide the commission size for running a smart contract. Again, this commission is not an income for the Computors, instead it gets burned to adjust the deflation/inflation in the ecosystem. Use Cases of Qubic Qubic’s potential goes beyond decentralization, enabling a future with powerful, accessible, and secure Artificial Intelligence (AI). This revolutionary technology has the potential to transform various sectors. For instance, it can help develop hyper-personalized healthcare treatments, drugs, or devices that improve our well-being and reduce any risks. Imagine creating a customized educational system for any type of student, adaptable in real-time to the development of each and every one of their abilities. Similarly, imagine developing new materials with never-before-seen properties that allow us to catapult the development of different fields such as clean energy production, aerospace development, or new materials for medical use. We are only at the tip of the iceberg of the development that we will experience during the next decade.How to Mine QUBIC? You can mine QUBIC in two main ways. Either mine them independently using the computational power of your mining hardware (solo-mining), or join a mining pool. Mining independently can be daunting for new users, or those who have limited computational resources. Joining a pool, on the other hand, can be more efficient. Pool mining is analogous to partnering up with a team to finish the tasks quickly and efficiently, and collectively enjoy the rewards. To join Qubic’s mining pool, you can visit Discord and choose between different mining pools. QUBIC mining hardware requirements Training AI models or even contributing to it as part of a pool is not an easy feat. It requires computational power. Hence, the key is to have powerful GPUs, AVX512 compatible CPUs with high core counts and capabilities for multithreading, high RAM speed, and efficient read/write throughput of the storage media.Where to purchase $QUBIC?Alternatively, even if you are not a miner you can still own $QUBIC. You can now purchase $QUBIC and trade it on the following two exchanges: Initially thought of in 2012, Qubic is a brainchild of Sergey Ivancheglo, also known as Come-From-Beyond in the crypto community. He is also the creator and co-creator of NXT and IOTA. The mainnet has been live since April 2022 and has gathered over 88,000 loyal community members with 500,000 miners on the network. Perhaps the most interesting thing about its launch was that it was fully fair without any VC money or premine.You can learn more about Qubic by following its team and community on X (formerly twitter):

The XRP Ledger is undergoing considerable volatility due to the shakeup of the market. This volatility is partly driven by the news regarding Ripple's plans to introduce a stablecoin. This proposed stablecoin has sparked debates and discussions because it has been labeled as an "unregistered crypto asset" by some regulatory bodies. The controversy arises from ongoing regulatory challenges that Ripple has faced, which have historically impacted XRP's performance and set the overall mood for the asset.XRP/USDT Chart by TradingViewAnother technical aspect is the formation of a symmetrical triangle on the XRP price chart. This pattern is indicative of a period where the asset's price is consolidating, and it typically precedes a significant breakout in either direction. The converging trend lines point to an upcoming volatility surge, making it a critical watch point for traders who anticipate major price movements soon.Moreover, the Exponential Moving Averages for XRP have converged significantly, suggesting that the market is in a state of uncertainty, with traders and algorithms poised for any signs of a definitive trend. This technical setup creates some issues for them, contributing further to the ongoing discussions about XRP.In addition to XRP, Monero is also receiving an unusual amount of attention. The privacy-focused cryptocurrency has been in the spotlight due to the LocalMonero shutdown, which was the biggest P2P trading platform for XMR.Intensified crackdowns on privacy coins like Monero, which are often associated with concerns about illicit activities due to their anonymity-enhancing features, create issues for centralized institutions, which are aiming for limitations of that kind of functionality. Regulatory pressure is increasing.

SEC delays crypto wallet provider Exodus' NYSE American listing amid ongoing scrutiny

Crypto wallet provider Exodus said the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) made a “surprising last-minute decision” that delayed its planned listing on the NYSE American Stock Exchange, according to a May 9 statement.NYSE said the SEC halted the listing because the financial regulator’s staff are still reviewing Exodus’s registration statement.Exodus added:“We’re hopeful the SEC will act in good faith, and Exodus will be welcomed to the NYSE in a timely manner. Crypto’s potential is undeniable…”Earlier in the week, Exodus revealed that its shares would be uplisted from the OTCQX to NYSE American by May 9. At the time, CEO JP Richardson said the move would “create greater long-term value for our stockholders by increasing our presence within the investor community and, in turn, increase liquidity.”However, with the SEC’s delaying the uplisting, Exodus said it might reconsider listing on a national securities exchange later. Nonetheless, its shares, with the ticker EXOD, would continue to trade on OTCQX.Richardson said:“While we are surprised and confused by this last-minute decision, we remain hopeful that the SEC will follow through on its commitment to treat us as the law intends. Exodus has been fully transparent and responsive throughout this process and we expect a swift resolution in this matter.”Meanwhile, recent unaudited reports on Exodus’ first-quarter earnings revealed a substantial 118% year-on-year revenue growth, totaling around $29.1 million. The firm said it has approximately 1.69 million active users.SEC’s crypto reluctanceIn recent years, the SEC, under Gary Gensler‘s leadership, has taken an aggressive stance toward the emerging crypto industry. Gensler’s tenure has been marked by a focus on integrating crypto into the SEC’s regulatory framework, using the Howey test to classify digital assets as securities.However, critics argue against the SEC’s heavy-handed enforcement tactics, urging Congress to provide clear legislative guidance instead. Unfortunately, the pace of legislative action in this realm has been slow, exacerbating the industry’s uncertainty.Mentioned in this article

Trump vows to end hostility toward crypto and promote supportive environment for businesses in the US - Crypto Briefing




Donald Trump has pledged to end hostility toward crypto and keep crypto businesses in the US. His declaration was made at the Trump Cards NFT Gala, an exclusive event for holders of his NFTs, on May 8.“If crypto is moving out of the US because of hostility toward crypto… well, we’ll stop it. We don’t want that,” Trump asserted. “If we’re going to embrace it, we have to let them be here.”He further expressed his campaign’s openness to accepting crypto donations.“If you can’t, I’ll make sure you can,” he assured. “Can we donate to the Trump campaign using crypto? I believe the answer is yes.”In addition, Trump criticized the current administration, suggesting that President Biden lacks an understanding of crypto, and positioned himself as the pro-crypto candidate. He also took a jab at SEC Chairman Gensler, labeling him and the Democrats as anti-crypto.The event, held at the Mar-a-Lago resort in Palm Beach, Florida, required attendees to own at least 47 of Trump’s NFTs. For the first time, presidential candidate Donald Trump has publicly supported not just Bitcoin, but the broader crypto market as well. This marks a significant shift from his previously anti-crypto stance.Trump kept his anti-crypto stance for quite a long time, but he has recently shown a shift in his stance. He said in an interview with Fox News that as more people want to pay in Bitcoin, he can live with it by any means. He also voiced opposition to the issuance of a central bank digital currency (CBDC).According to Standard Chartered, Bitcoin could benefit from a Trump re-election. The bank suggests a Trump election victory potentially creates a more crypto-friendly regulatory landscape.The Biden administration announced yesterday its intention to veto H.J. Res. 109, a resolution aimed at overturning the SEC’s Staff Accounting Bulletin 121 (SAB 121). The administration’s stance is that repealing SAB 121 would undermine the SEC’s ability to protect investors and could lead to financial instability.The regulation is seen as discriminatory against crypto assets and has been criticized for deterring banks from engaging in crypto storage.On May 8, the US House of Representatives passed Representative Mike Flood’s (NE-01) bipartisan H.J.Res. 109, which aims to overturn the SEC’s SAB 121.

                        Core Scientific announced its financial results for the first quarter of 2024, highlighting a significant recovery with a net income of $211 million.According to its latest press release, Core Scientific’s performance this quarter marked a notable improvement from the previous year’s figures. The company attributed this turnaround to an increase in revenue generated from both Bitcoin mining and hosting services.
Core Scientific’s Strong Performance in Q1
Core Scientific reported a substantial rise in net income, achieving $210.7 million, compared to a net loss of $0.4 million in the same period last year. It produced an adjusted EBITDA of $88 million.The company mined 2,825 bitcoins during the quarter, leveraging expanded mining capacity and operational efficiencies to boost production.This increase in mining capability contributed significantly to the revenue, which totaled $179.3 million, marking a 49% rise from the previous year’s first quarter. The revenue from bitcoin mining alone accounted for $150 million, supplemented by $29 million from hosting services.The release stated that Core Scientific self-mined more Bitcoin than any other publicly listed miner in North America during Q1.Additionally, the company owns and manages approximately 745 megawatts of infrastructure, making it the largest owned infrastructure footprint among publicly listed miners in the region.
CEO Adam Sullivan Comments on Report
Core Scientific previously secured a contract with CoreWeave to provide high-performance compute hosting at a new 16-megawatt data center in Austin, which was completed and delivered more than 30 days ahead of schedule.“We delivered outstanding results in the first quarter…strengthening our balance sheet by paying down debt and improving our cash position, and improving our fleet efficiency with the deployment of new generation miners,” said Core Scientific CEO Adam Sullivan.“By taking full advantage of favorable market fundamentals and by focusing on productivity and efficiency, we generated strong financial performance that demonstrates our ability to create value for our shareholders,” stated Sullivan.

Donald Trump's Comments on Crypto Cause Massive Pumps in These Meme Coins


																TL;DR

Donald Trump now endorses cryptocurrencies, reversing his previous skepticism and promoting himself as the pro-crypto candidate in contrast to Joe Biden, who he claims opposes the industry.
The meme coin BODEN, linked to Joe Biden, rose 40% in value, while MAGA, associated with Trump’s slogan, surged by 60%.


BODEN and MAGA Flash Green
The elections for America’s next president are just a few months away, and the main candidates have already started firing shots at each other. The latest confrontation was caused by the Republican nominee – Donald Trump.
Interestingly, he touched upon cryptocurrencies, claiming that his opponent – Joe Biden – and the people from his cabinet are against the industry. On the contrary, Trump assured he is the right choice for those in favor of the asset class:
“I’m fine with it. I want to make sure it’s good and solid and everything else. But I’m good with it. And if you like crypto in any form (and it comes in many different forms), if you are in favor of crypto, you better vote for Trump.”
The billionaire was also asked about his opinion on a meme coin, BODEN, whose market capitalization reached $250 million and depicts president Joe Biden. Trump said “that’s a lot of money for a coin,” adding he does not fancy such investment.
Despite his negative opinion, BODEN’s price soared substantially in the past few hours. It spiked by 40%, climbing to as high as $0.42 before retracing to the current level of $0.35 (per CoinGecko’s data).

The meme coin with a ticker MAGA (standing for the political slogan popularized by Trump – “Make America Great Again”) has exploded even more impressively. Its price briefly crossed the $7 mark, representing a 60% surge.

Trump’s U-Turn
It is worth mentioning that Donald Trump has not been that supportive of the cryptocurrency sector back in the day. A few years ago, he called Bitcoin (BTC) “a scam,” adding that he didn’t like it because “it’s another currency competing against the dollar.” He started softening his tone earlier this year, stating he can “live” with the digital asset:
“You probably have to do some regulation, as you know. But many people are embracing it, and more and more, I’m seeing people wanting to pay “bitcoin,” and you’re seeing something that’s interesting. So, I can live with it one way or the other. 
Trump also jumped on the NFT bandwagon, releasing a collection of digital art depicting him in a superhero style. As CryptoPotato reported, the value of the non-fungible tokens jumped significantly following the American’s arrest in April last year and his interview with Tucker Carlson a few months later.

South Korean convenience store sells Bitcoin-themed ‘meal boxes’

South Korean convenience store chain Emart24 revealed a new partnership with local cryptocurrency exchange Bithumb to introduce a new Bitcoin “meal box” available for purchase in-store. On May 9, Emart24 and Bithumb said there will be approximately 30,000 of the meal boxes, which will be available by the end of the month. Each box will sell at 5,900 Korean won ($4.30). According to reports from local media, a representative from Bithumb said that customers could receive 10,000 won worth of Bitcoin (BTC) if they download the exchange’s app and enter the number of the coupon found in each meal box. Additionally, Bithumb is offering 20,000 won worth of Bitcoin for customers who create a Bitcoin account with the NH Nonghyup bank. The spokesperson said that customers who already have an account must connect it to Bithumb to receive the additional Bitcoin. Bithumb is one of South Korea’s leading cryptocurrency exchanges. It is a member of the Digital Asset Exchange Association (DAXA), along with Upbit, Coinone, Korbit and Gopax. It also announced plans to become the first crypto exchange listed on the South Korean stock market, though its plans for an initial public offering have been delayed. This Bitcoin meal box development follows continued hype over the cryptocurrency after the long-awaited halving event, which took place on April 20. Related: South Korean lawmakers traded almost $100 million of crypto in 3 yearsThe cryptocurrency hit a new all-time high in March, almost passing $74,000. Analysts are concluding that the current dip in price comes as Bitcoin bulls suffer “boredom” post-halving. Bitcoin gained momentum after the United States greenlit its first Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) on Jan. 10. In South Korea, on May 7, news broke that the newly elected democratic party is promising to allow Bitcoin ETFs and that the party would be making the request after the opening of the National Assembly in June.However, over the last few years, regulations in South Korea have been keeping a closer watch on the crypto space. In 2024, legislators introduced tougher sentences for crypto-related crimes, along with new guidelines for cryptocurrency exchanges. In late 2023, financial regulators in South Korea began asking crypto users in the country to report any unlicensed exchanges offering services in the region.

Solana Slerf (SOLSLERF) to Explode 9,000%, as it Looks to Take on Shiba Inu and Dogecoin



                    

Solana Slerf (SOLSLERF) could become a viral memecoin, like Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE).



Solana Slerf (SOLSLERF), a Solana memecoin that was launched this week, is aiming to challenge other memecoin giants, such as Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE).




Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Solana Slerf presents a similar opportunity.



Solana Slerf has market cap below $10,000 at the moment, meaning that when it just reaches a modest market cap of $200,000-$500,000, early investors would generate returns of 2,000%-5,000% in a matter of days or hours.



The exciting memecoin is poised to rally 9,000% in the coming two days, and Solana Slerf could potentially reach a multi-million dollar market cap within a few weeks.




Currently, Solana Slerf can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jupiter and Raydium, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days.



To buy Solana Slerf on these platforms, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Solana Slerf by entering its contract address – D2R7sKwPNpWGtEfMJiLVe5G2ZJbExnk98PEft2dhyCrL – in the receiving field.



In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price.



If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner.




The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum.



This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like SOLSLERF.

Not Every FTX Customer Is Happy To Be Reimbursed: Here's Why - Benzinga

Bankrupt cryptocurrency exchange FTX’s recent announcement of reimbursing its customers in full with interest has drawn mixed reactions.What Happened: CNBC reported Mackenzie Sigalos pointed out that while FTX plans to pay back its customers, many are unhappy due to the freezing of the value of their crypto assets back in November 2022, during the bear market.During CNBC’s “Last Call” on Wednesday, Sigalos pointed out that customers will be reimbursed based on the value of their assets at the time of the bankruptcy, not their current value.“Bitcoin was trading at $17,043 on the day the FTX filed for bankruptcy. If you own just one Bitcoin BTC/USD that day, under this proposed bankruptcy plan, you would get 118% of that back, that is 20K [$20,000]. And today, bitcoin is trading at $62,000. That’s a big difference,” she explained.See Also: ‘Dogecoin Killer’ Shiba Inu Burn Rate Spikes 800%, Crypto Market Rallies As Sentiment Soars And More: ThiWhy It Matters: FTX, the cryptocurrency exchange that filed for bankruptcy in November 2022, has managed to accumulate a substantial cash reserve, allowing it to fully reimburse its customers. The company, now under the leadership of CEO John Ray, is set to distribute as much as $16.3 billion in cash among its creditors, which amounts to about $5.3 billion more than what is owed.Earlier, FTX’s founder, Sam Bankman-Fried, reached a tentative agreement with a group of defrauded customers. The agreement, pending judicial approval, stipulates that the plaintiffs will withdraw their class action lawsuit against Bankman-Fried, who in return will aid their ongoing legal actions against various celebrity endorsers of the now-defunct cryptocurrency exchange.Price Action: On Thursday, Bitcoin was trading 1.76% lower at $61,295.70 at the time of writing, according to Benzinga Pro.Read Next: Bitcoin, Ethereum, Dogecoin Trade Sideways, Trader Asks: ‘Does It Matter If You Buy Bitcoin At $62,000 Or $58,000’?Photo by Sergei Elagin on Shutterstock

Octane: the new blockchain framework for Arbitrum and Celestia

Yesterday, Omni Network presented to its audience the new high-performance modular blockchain implementation Octane, capable of connecting the EVM world with CometBFT.
The new framework can be used to create layer-1 networks and decentralized sequencers for layer-2 with extremely high transaction throughput, offering excellent integration opportunities with the Arbitrum, Celestia, and EigenLayer ecosystems.
Let’s see all the details below

Omni Network introduces Octane and solves the problem of combining EVM and CometBFT
Omni Network, a well-known project that aims to unify the various Ethereum layer-2 solutions, introduced a major technological innovation yesterday that could greatly improve the user experience and simplify the lives of developers in the blockchain field.
This is the modular implementation Octane, which is nothing more than a framework capable of being integrated with Arbitrum, Celestia, and Eigenlayer given its extensive connectivity capabilities.
Octane essentially aims to connect the standard EVM with other blockchain applications, breaking down the barrier that separates the possibility of integrating multiple software of different natures. 
Any developer will be able to take advantage of this open source implementation to create a custom and high-performance blockchain infrastructure, highly integrated with the external world.

In particular, Octane solves one of the biggest unresolved issues in the blockchain sector, namely the connection between EVM consensus engines and CometBFT (formerly Tendermint). 
Let’s talk about two inherently incompatible and technologically different components: the first is characterized by advanced development tools and strong network effects while the second provides blockchain with fast and low-latency purposes supporting the Cosmos ecosystem.
Thanks to its modular design, Octane, in addition to offering potential opportunities in the niches of Arbitrum and Celestia, can technically combine any consensus engine to meet specific needs. 
Until now, the task of integrating EVM-CometBFT was reserved for Ethermint, a standard that still presents scalability and blockchain maintenance issues.
 The main innovations of Octane are based on the Ethereum Engine API and CosmosABCI 2.0, where the Engine API separates the execution environment from the consensus engine, preventing transactions from interfering with the blockchain consensus.
ABCI 2.0 integrates the engine’s API providing a programmable interface for high-performance consensus engines like CometBFT, offering the end user an easy and immediate solution for the development of decentralized applications.
From a consensus perspective, Octane has been specifically designed to support CometBFT, but it also works with other consensus engines that implement ABCI 2.0,

Octane simplifies EVM integration with blockchain applications: opportunities for Celestia, Arbitrum, Monad, and EigenLayer
The maximum connectivity of EVM blockchain applications introduced with the modular Octane framework also brings technical capabilities above average with sub-second purposes, RPC query latencies up to 5 milliseconds and an extremely high transaction throughput.
This potentially allows the development of any kind of high-performance blockchain application on CometBFT and other EVM environments, unlocking the true potential of the cryptographic sector.
In this sense, the new implementation of Omni Network finds several opportunities for integration with the Arbitrum, Celestia, EigenLayer ecosystems, and many others
Peter Haymond, Senior Partnerships Manager at Offchain Labs (the organization behind Arbitrum) used the following words to describe the benefits brought by Octane:
“With the proliferation of Arbitrum Orbit chains, Omni’s Octane brings us one step closer to fulfilling their mission of uniting all rollups and creating a smoother and more integrated Ethereum experience for end users.”
Octane can be used both to develop layer-1 networks with optimized performance, or to implement decentralized sequencers in layer-2 networks, maintaining the typical speed of centralized counterparts.
Indeed, it works with any EVM client, and can also be used to optimize implementations on the new Monad blockchain or on Movement.
In addition, it can be connected to data availability networks (DA), such as Celestia or EigenDA (AVS by EigenLayer), thanks to low-cost blockchain expertise.
Regarding the introduction of Octane, Nima Vaziri from Eigen Labs commented in a press release:
“The implementation of Octane EVM can be used both to create new high-performance chain AVS protected by restaking, and for rollups with decentralized sequencers using EigenDA to achieve fast confirmations and high throughput. We are excited to see the proliferation of tools in the Eigen ecosystem that will help accelerate open innovation.”
The only requirement to take advantage of the opportunities brought by Octane is the “Open Interoperability Requirement” which requires projects to establish and maintain an IBC connection to the Omni network within 90 days of production implementation.
It is possible that the Omni team will also add IBC connections and other networks in the future so that the framework can prevent liquidity fragmentation on-chain and connect most cryptographic ecosystems.
Even Tyler Tarsi, CTO of Omni Labs, has publicly spoken to comment on this huge success by his team:
“The high-performance architecture of Octane has only been made possible in the last six months thanks to recent advancements in ABCI++ and the Ethereum Engine API. It has unlocked a completely new class of performance that no previous generation EVM implementation was able to achieve. This was crucial in creating the Omni Network itself and we are proud to see so many teams interested in using Octane in their own stacks.”

R. Kiyosaki warns the dollar ‘is screwed up’ and ‘it’s going to get worse'


Although he openly admitted he didn’t know much about Bitcoin (BTC), famous investor and author of the bestselling personal finance book ‘Rich Dad Poor Dad’ Robert Kiyosaki has been a fan of the maiden cryptocurrency and has recently bought some of the largest altcoin, Ethereum (ETH), as well.
As it happens, Kiyosaki was discussing gold, silver, and Bitcoin as investments, as well as the declining value of the United States dollar (USD), with his guest Andy Schectman, the CEO of Miles Franklin Precious Metals, in the latest episode of ‘The Rich Dad Channel’ podcast premiered on May 8.
According to the finance educator, the declining dollar is the main reason to accumulate these alternative investments, especially considering his view that the already dire situation was only going to get worse and that schools, in his opinion, are not very good at teaching financial literacy:



“It’s a reason to buy gold, silver, Bitcoin, and all this because our currency is screwed up now, it’s going to get worse because our debt keeps going up. (…) The reason we buy gold, silver, and Bitcoin is the same reason – it’s not any different, just tell me how many ounces you have. (…) I buy gold, silver, Bitcoin, and I just bought some Ethereum simply for the same reason – our money is fake.”

Why people are getting poorer
Furthermore, he believes that “people are getting poorer and poorer in America, because most of our school teachers and Marxists and they hate the rich, that’s why they’re going after [former US President Donald] Trump, they hate him because he’s a rich man.”
On top of that, Kiyosaki pointed out the absence of counterparty risk issues when it comes to borrowing money in the ‘fake’ fiat currency like the dollar as opposed to the above assets, arguing that he wouldn’t know who is the person to pay him back:

“If I borrow money, who’s the guy to pay me back? And gold and silver – you don’t need that – the same as Bitcoin, you have no counterparty risk.”

Kiyosaki and Bitcoin
Finally, he also admitted he was something of a latecomer to the flagship decentralized finance (DeFi) asset, getting on board when the largest asset in the crypto market was already trading at $6,000, whereas today it costs about $60,000, highlighting the importance of the lesson provided by this experience.
As a reminder, Kiyosaki has recently warned that the financial crash has already begun and listed his rules to remember during this time, including being patient, studying, making friends with similar viewpoints, starting a side business, choosing better teachers, and saving the above assets instead of money.
It is also worth noting that, much like the founder and CEO of ARK Invest, Cathie Wood, the ‘Rich Dad’ author believes that Bitcoin price USD could hit $2.3 million. For now, however, the price of this crypto asset is $61,253, so doing one’s own research and keeping up with BTC news is critical when investing.

Trump Says He Is “Good” With Crypto While Biden Doesn’t Even Know What It Is | Cryptoglobe


                                
Former U.S. President and 2024 presidential hopeful Donald Trump has endorsed cryptocurrency during a special event for Trump NFT holders at his Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida. The embattled politician lamented the exodus of crypto companies from the United States due to perceived hostility towards digital assets, stating, “If we’re going to embrace it, we have to let them be here.”







Trump’s newfound embrace of crypto is a significant shift from his previous stance, and it comes at a time when his popularity among the crypto community is on the rise. In March, a poll commissioned by leading crypto venture capital firm Paradigm revealed that 48% of crypto owners plan to vote for Trump, compared to 39% who plan to vote for the incumbent, President Joe Biden.







During the event, Trump took questions from the crypto-savvy crowd and expressed his willingness to accept campaign donations in Bitcoin and other tokens. He also criticized the current administration, claiming President Biden and U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) Chair Gary Gensler are ignorant and hostile towards crypto.







Trump’s support for digital assets has not gone unnoticed by analysts, who suggest that his potential victory in the November presidential election could be a boon for Bitcoin. The Mar-a-Lago event also coincided with the passage of a resolution in the U.S. House condemning the U.S. SEC’s policy on crypto banking, highlighting the growing divide between pro-crypto and anti-crypto factions in the political sphere.







            
            

            
            

            
            

        

President Joe Biden’s administration has announced its intention to veto a joint resolution that could impact cryptocurrency policy overseen by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). On May 8, the White House issued a statement expressing strong opposition to efforts by certain House of Representatives members to pass a joint resolution. According to the statement, this legislative move could undermine the SEC’s ongoing efforts to protect cryptocurrency investors and ensure the stability of the broader financial system. House Joint Resolution 109, proposed in February, aims to reverse the SEC’s Staff Accounting Bulletin (SAB) No. 121. This bulletin mandates that banks must include customers’ digital assets in their balance sheets and maintain sufficient capital against them.



The event also brought attention to the recent surge in prices for Solana-based meme coins featuring caricatures of Trump and Biden, with “Jeo Boden” ($BODEN) and “Doland Tremp” ($TREMP) tokens reaching market capitalizations of $473 million and $83 million, respectively. Trump, however, expressed his disapproval of the Biden-themed token’s valuation, stating, “That’s a lot of money for a coin, I don’t like that investment.”



Trump also took credit for making NFTs hot again:

Active Bitcoin supporter and CEO of Jan3 Samson Mow has published a tweet about the recent surge in BTC demand, which tremendously surpasses the Bitcoin supply now.He also made a prediction that a new conflict around the world’s flagship digital currency is likely to arise soon.Bullish Bitcoin call from Jan3 bossBitcoin OG Samson Mow, who used to work as CSO at Adam Back’s Blockstream, made a reminder to his audience on the X platform that American spot Bitcoin ETFs continue to buy massive amounts of BTC on a daily basis.Currently, he specified, these ETFs are scooping up approximately 1,626 BTC per day. However, it is now only these exchange-traded funds that are grabbing a lot of Bitcoin regularly. Apart from them, there is also the Michael Saylor-led MicroStrategy that is buying 199 BTC per day, Mow claims, and Tether, which is acquiring 70 BTC per day.Samson concluded that with only 450 BTC minted daily since the new halving in April, the overall aggregate demand for the leading cryptocurrency has now likely surpassed the available supply 5-10x. “Plan accordingly,” is the tip he gave to the Bitcoin community. Big new Bitcoin conflict in sight, Mow saysIn a recent interview, an extract of which was shared by the Jan3 official account this week, Mow shared that he expects a new Bitcoin conflict to happen soon. He is not sure when exactly it will happen, but “it’s going to make the previous one pale in comparison,” according to Samson.The previous Bitcoin conflict would seem just like “a couple of kids in the schoolyard slapping each other.” The reason why a new Bitcoin war may happen, Mow believes, is that a lot of things here have changed, and BTC has gone mainstream, so much bigger players than before are emerging now. If 10 years ago the community believed that Coinbase and Bitmain were the big ones, Mow explained, then now BlackRock and Fidelity giants are involved with BTC.The new conflict may be about the Bitcoin block size, according to Mow, or over anything else, such as over adding “a travel rule into Bitcoin.” And this conflict is going to be 10x or 100x what it was in the past.

Trump Pledges To 'Make Sure You Can' Donate Using Crypto To His 2024 Campaign - Unwittingly Sends Memecoin Parodying Biden Surging - Benzinga

Former President Donald Trump delivered a notable endorsement of cryptocurrencies during a campaign speech on Wednesday and unwittingly sent a meme coin inspired by his arch-political rival surging after commenting on the digital token.What Happened: In a video shared on X by non-fungible token influencer Frank DeGods, Trump can be seen addressing a large crowd at an NFT event at his Mar-a-Lago residence in Florida, saying, “Can we donate to the Trump campaign using crypto? I believe the answer is yes.” “If you can’t, I’ll make sure you can,” he said.Another social media user shared a video clip where he appears to be questioning Trump on how he plans to retain cryptocurrency firms within the U.S. In response, Trump asserted, “We'll stop it because I don't want it. If we're going to embrace it, we have to let them be here.” The audience reacted with applause to Trump’s statement.See Also: How to Buy Bitcoin (BTC)Trump also took a jab at his competitor, President Joe Biden, expressing skepticism about his understanding of cryptocurrencies. Towards the end of the video, Trump emphasized, “If you're in favor of crypto, you better vote for Trump.”Trump also commented on Jeo Boden BODEN/USD, a token that misspells President Biden's name, saying, “I don't like that investment.” But the token surged over 14% following the former president’s remark.Why It Matters: Trump’s crypto portfolio is worth over $5.6 million, as per a recent report, mostly comprising MAGA Coin TRUMP/USD, Ethereum ETH/USD, Wrapped Ether and other memecoins, obtained through the sale of NFT projects using his name and likeness. Some also believe this could help him pay the hundreds of millions in fines he has racked up in ongoing legal cases.The former president throughout his 2024 campaign has openly shown his softening stance on Bitcoin BTC/USD, although he has said the dollar remains his favorite currency. Cryptocurrency owners, however, seem to favor him over Biden, as per recent surveys.British multinational bank Standard Chartered this week predicted positive prospects for the cryptocurrency sector if Trump secures another term in office.This stance sharply contrasts with the Biden administration’s actions, vetoing legislation that would have permitted reputable financial institutions to hold Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. Read Next: Robinhood Reports 3X Jump In Crypto Volume, Executives Say ‘Business As Usual’ Despite SEC Wells NoticeImage via Shutterstock

MarketVector's MEMECOIN Index Soars 137.96% Year-to-Date


							

VanEck’s MarketVector introduces MEMECOIN, tracking top meme coins with a 137.96% YTD return.



MEMECOIN uses a capped market cap-weighted approach to balance risk, with Dogecoin and Shiba Inu dominating.



VanEck emphasizes the speculative and volatile character of meme currencies and cautions that they should only be used for amusement rather than investment.




MarketVector, a subsidiary of VanEck, has introduced the Meme Coin Index (MEMECOIN). This index tracks the performance of six major meme coins, including Dogecoin, Shiba Inu, Pepe, dogwifhat, Floki Inu, and BONK. According to an X post by Wu Blockchain, this index has returned an impressive 137.96% year-to-date, making it the best-performing index on MarketVector.







The MEMECOIN index is a market capitalization-weighted index, with weights restricted at 30% for each coin. This method aims to diversify risks within the index. Dogecoin and Shiba Inu are dominating the index, with weightings of 30.64% and 28.01%, respectively. Coins like BONK (6.21%), Pepe (14.18%), dogwifhat (13.29%), and Floki Inu (7.17%) are also included in the index.



VanEck has released a disclaimer, highlighting that meme coins are meant for fun reasons, notwithstanding the index’s success. This draws attention to how speculative and unstable these assets are and advises investors to do their research.









The most recent update shows that Dogecoin’s 24-hour trading volume is $1.134 billion, its market worth is $21.263 billion, and its current price is $0.47442. With a current price of $0.000023 and a 24-hour trading volume of $397,857,784, Shiba Inu has a market value of $13.479 billion.

As Bitcoin's price remains at $61K, something strange is going on! - AMBCrypto



Bitcoin’s social activity dropped to its lowest in the year.
BTC remained in the $61,000 price zone.

Recent data indicates that Bitcoin [BTC] has experienced its lowest level of social activity. However, despite this decline, Bitcoin still maintains a significant presence in discussions within the crypto space.
 The network remains active, indicating ongoing engagement and participation despite the decrease in social activity.
Bitcoin social activity sees a yearly low
Per data from LunarCrush, there was a decline in the social activity surrounding Bitcoin. This is significant, as it marks the first time this year that social activity has fallen to such levels. 
The chart illustrated that social activity was at approximately 98 million at press time, approaching a critical threshold. 
This decrease could be attributed to the recent decline in BTC’s price, with the cryptocurrency struggling to maintain the $61,000 price range.
Other Bitcoin social metrics show decent movements
AMBCrypto’s analysis of the Social Dominance on Santiment indicated that Bitcoin continued to maintain a significant portion of dominance in discussions within the cryptocurrency space.
 The chart also revealed that between the previous trading session and press time, BTC’s Social Dominance has remained within the 26% range.
 However, there has been a slight change, with Social Dominance shifting from 26.21% to 26.42% at the time of this writing. 
Source: Santiment
The Social Volume concluded the 8th of May with a count of 4,622. While this number is not the highest observed this year, it also is not the lowest. 
Overall, this suggests that despite the reported decline in social activity, Bitcoin continued to maintain a substantial presence in cryptocurrency discussions.
24-hour active addresses show good enough activity
AMBCrypto’s look at Bitcoin’s 24-hour active addresses chart indicated a recent decline compared to activity levels observed earlier in the month and the previous month. 
As of this writing, the number of active addresses was around 721,000, signifying a considerable volume of activity on the network despite the recent dip.

BTC catches a breather — for now
At the time of writing, Bitcoin was trading at around $61,550, marking a roughly 0.7% increase on a daily timeframe chart.

This positive price movement is notable as it contrasts with the recent days of decline, suggesting that buyers currently have the upper hand.

Navigating Bitcoin’s Price Dip: Will $61K Hold or Are We Heading to $52K? | Cryptoglobe


                                
Earlier today, crypto analyst Michaël van de Poppe highlighted a critical juncture in Bitcoin’s price trajectory on social media platform X, providing key insights into potential future movements.



The prominent analyst notes that Bitcoin is currently at the “range low.” In technical analysis, the “range low” refers to the lower boundary of a price range within which Bitcoin has been trading over a specific period. This level is significant because it represents a support level where price declines are typically arrested due to an influx of buying interest, preventing further drops. According to van de Poppe, this is “technically the area where you’d prefer to see it hold,” suggesting that maintaining this level is crucial for sustaining Bitcoin’s upward momentum and ensuring the price range remains intact.







            
            

            
            

            
            

        

Van de Poppe warns that if the range low does not hold, Bitcoin could potentially drop to a new low in the range of $52,000 to $55,000. This scenario would represent a significant correction, indicating a downturn in market sentiment and possibly triggering a bearish phase for Bitcoin. The phrase “potential low on this correction” reflects an anticipated floor price during the current market adjustment, which could be a critical point for traders to reassess their positions.







At the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading at around $61,036, marking a 2% decrease over the past 24 hours. Despite this recent dip, Bitcoin has shown a robust performance year-to-date, registering a 45.30% increase against the USD.

Donald Trump says he’s ‘fine with crypto,’ slams Biden not understanding it


Amid the presidential elections campaign in the United States picking up steam, the former US President Donald Trump has expressed support for the cryptocurrency sector, pointing out at the differences on this issue between him and his rival, the current US President Joe Biden.
As it happens, Trump was answering questions from the audience during an exclusive dinner for buyers of his Mugshot Edition non-fungible tokens (NFTs) at his Mar-a-Lago resort in Palm Beach, Florida, as per a series of video clips shared by Frank Degods, a prominent figure in the NFT realm, on May 9.
‘If you’re in favor of crypto, you better vote Trump’
Indeed, in one of these videos, the former President argued that the incumbent US President didn’t even understand crypto and that the US Securities and Exchange Commission, alongside the Democratic Party, was “very much against it,” but that he himself was “fine with it,” suggesting that other crypto supporters should vote for him.



“If you asked Biden, ‘Sir, are you for or against crypto?,’ [he’d say] ‘What’s that?’ (…) He has no idea, but look, [SEC chair Gary] Gensler is very much against it, the Democrats are very much against it, and I say this: a lot of people are very much for it, probably a lot of people in this group, and I’m fine with it, I want to make sure it’s good and solid and everything else, but I’m good with it.”


Furthermore, the influencer shared a video of him asking Trump how he was going to keep crypto businesses in America, to which the former President acknowledged that these businesses were leaving because of the regulatory “hostility toward crypto,” and promised to stop it and “let them be here.”
Donating in crypto
On top of that, Trump reassured his supporters from the crypto and NFT sphere of his dedication to enabling crypto contributions to his campaign, stressing that he would make sure it was possible for them to do this even if it wasn’t currently possible, stating that:

“If you can’t, I’ll make sure you can. Can we donate to the Trump campaign using crypto? I believe the answer is yes.”

As a reminder, Trump had gradually shifted his crypto stance, moving from believing that “Bitcoin (BTC) is a scam” to launching his own NFT collection called Trump Digital Trading Cards and, more recently, the Mugshot Edition, to a more friendly position regarding paying with Bitcoin and other crypto assets.

FTX Customers Face Potential $10B Loss with Proposed Compensation Plan


							

Sunil Kavuri criticizes FTX’s compensation plan for severely undervaluing customer claims.



FTX customers will potentially lose $10 billion with the proposed plan.



The plan includes clauses shielding the firm from lawsuits, which may lead to claim forfeitures if checks are not cashed in time.




Creditor activist Sunil Kavuri has voiced strong opposition to the proposed plan of FTX to compensate the defrauded customers of the fallen crypto exchange. Kavur took to X to outline his concerns and encourage a collective “NO” vote against the plan. For context, FTX creditors stand to lose over $10 billion should the proposed plan pass.







The activist highlighted the proposed repayment structure severely undervalues the claims of FTX customers. Specifically, the plan suggests paying out claims with an 18% return for those under $50,000 and a staggered 25% to 47% for claims over $50,000. 



Notably, this gross undervaluation arises because FTX is seeking to pay defrauded customers the monetary value of their assets as of the bankruptcy filing rather than the actual crypto assets. Illustratively, Bitcoin traded around $16K when FTX went bankrupt in November 2022 but has since reached $73,750 in 2024.









Notably, this plan was drafted by the law firm Sullivan & Cromwell (S&C). Kavuri insists that S&C and the debtors owe customers the current value of their holdings, which could be three to ten times the petition prices. The FTX creditor activist argued that S&C is destroying an estimated $10 billion value of defrauded users with the plan.



Meanwhile, Kavuri highlighted that the law firm included an exculpation clause that would effectively shield the firm and other parties from lawsuits related to misconduct. Essentially, the law firm is seeking to absolve key players from legal responsibility that may arise from the plan.



Furthermore, the activist pointed out a clause that could lead to the forfeiture of claims if the issued checks are not cashed within a six-month window. This stipulation could disenfranchise creditors who may not cash their checks promptly.Ultimately, Kavuri asserts that each defendant should be held liable for the full current value of FTX customers’ losses rather than the reduced figures proposed in the plan. Meanwhile, some commentators have suggested that voting against this plan may cost creditors an additional two years of waiting before getting their funds.

Subscribe now to Alpha Reports and up your game!Go to Alpha ReportsElection-themed meme coins caricaturing U.S. politicians have surged overnight, in the wake of former president Donald Trump's meeting with holders of his NFT collection.Leading the pack was Solana-based meme coin Doland Tremp (TREMP), which hit $0.69 after jumping a whopping 155% over the past 24 hours. Ethereum-based meme coin MAGA (TRUMP) also rose by 42% overnight, to its current price of $6.11.On the other side of the political aisle, Jeo Boden (BODEN) also rose by a more modest 23.2%, to $0.37. The meme coin caricaturing Joe Biden saw gains despite Trump declaring that, "I don't like that investment" in his Q&A session with holders of the Trump NFT collection.The BODEN and TREMP meme coins shot to prominence earlier this year, surging to a market capitalization of $473 million and $83 million respectively in April, before tumbling to their current market capitalizations of $246 million and $67 million.Upon hearing that a meme coin poking fun at his political rival was worth over $240 million, Trump called it "a lot of money for a coin."Meme coins, cryptocurrencies based on internet memes and current events, typically have limited liquidity and high volatility linked to their prominence in news cycles.

Shiba Inu's Staking Solution K9 Finance Unveils 2 Major News


								K9 Finance, the liquid staking solution for the Shiba Inu ecosystem, recently announced two major updates: a live demo for its Bone Crusher platform and its integration into Shibarium’s test network, Puppynet.
Shiba Inu’s Staking Solution Is Coming
The latest update from K9 Finance includes a detailed tutorial video that showcases forthcoming features set to enhance the Bone Crusher platform. This video serves as a preview, highlighting the capabilities that will be available with the mainnet release scheduled for the third quarter of this year.
In the video, K9 Finance demonstrates the new wallet connectivity feature that will allow users to link their digital wallets securely with the platform. This enhancement is designed to simplify transactions and interactions, thereby improving the user experience significantly.
Additionally, the upcoming update will introduce the platform’s staking functionality. Users will be able to stake BONE tokens directly through the platform. This feature is critical for the health and security of the network as it incentivizes user participation and contributes to the decentralized nature of the ecosystem.

The video also details the introduction of an advanced token swapping feature. This function will enable users to seamlessly swap knBONE tokens within the platform, offering them greater flexibility in managing their digital assets. The ease of token swaps is a crucial element in promoting a user-friendly DeFi environment.
Moreover, the update will enhance the platform’s reward system, enabling users to claim rewards in KNINE, BONE, and other tokens. This improved reward mechanism is designed to drive engagement and participation by providing users with diverse benefits and incentives.


Whitelisting On Shibarium’s Puppynet
Alongside the preview of the Bone Crusher update, K9 Finance has also been officially whitelisted on Shibarium’s Puppynet. This development extends the platform’s operational capabilities within the Shibarium ecosystem. With this whitelisting, K9 Finance can now distribute BONE rewards through its validator, increasing the attractiveness of holding KNINE tokens.

The validator’s role is crucial not only for the distribution of rewards but also for enhancing the network’s security and promoting decentralization. These functions are vital for establishing a robust and resilient network capable of facing various operational challenges.
A particularly exciting feature announced in conjunction with this development is the introduction of the first and only liquid staking derivative for Shiba Inu on the testnet. This innovation adds a unique element to the ecosystem and may set a precedent for future developments in DeFi staking solutions.


Buzz, the pseudonymous founder and lead developer of K9 Finance, expressed enthusiasm about these advancements, stating, “One small step towards crushing the FUD of ‘why isn’t KNINE on Shibarium’. FUD will be crushed with actions and building. Now live on Puppynet.”
At press time, Shiba Inu traded at $0.00002271.

Ethereum (ETH) Statement from Grayscale CEO: "We did not give up!" - Bitcoin Sistemi


Grayscale recently withdrew its application for an Ethereum futures ETF, causing a lot of speculation in the market.
While the reason behind Grayscale's move is not fully known, new statements came from Gryascale CEO Michael Sonnenshien.



Speaking at the event hosted by the Financial Times in London yesterday, Grayscale CEO stated that they have not given up on Ethereum.
“Our focus is Spot Ethereum ETF!”
Stating that they will continue to focus on turning Grayscale's Ethereum Trust (ETHE) into a spot Ethereum ETF, as is the case with Bitcoin, Sonnenshien emphasized that they have not given up on the spot ETH ETF path.





Making a statement about the withdrawal of the Ethereum futures ETF application, the famous CEO said:

“As Grayscale, we have decided to focus our energy on our spot products. We will continue to work on the Spot Ethereum ETF.
We withdrew our application for an ETH futures ETF because there are already many Ethereum futures ETFs in the market. These products dominate the majority of the ETH Futures ETF market.
Sometimes applying for a product does not necessarily mean that it will come to market. It is necessary to retreat when necessary.”

SEC's Position on Ethereum Still Unclear!
Grayscale CEO stated that there is uncertainty regarding the SEC's stance on Ethereum and stated that the SEC still does not fully classify ETH as a security.


Stating that he believes that the SEC will prioritize investor interests at this point, Sonnenshein reiterated that they will continue to strive for the approval of the spot Ethereum ETF.

Analyst Benjamin Cowen Warns Ethereum ‘Still Facing Headwinds,’ Says ETH Will Only Go Up if Bitcoin Does This - The Daily Hodl


								The widely followed analyst Benjamin Cowen is saying that Ethereum (ETH) is at risk of facing more downside over the coming months.
In a new video, Cowen tells his 801,000 YouTube subscribers that monetary policy is likely to negatively affect Ethereum.










“I think that ETH/USD is still facing some headwinds here, especially following the potential rejection of the spot exchange-traded fund (ETF)…
…I think the impact that people are going to feel is just from tighter monetary policy. They’re going to blame it on the spot ETF and they’re going to capitulate potentially into that.”
According to Cowen, the Ethereum could go up on one condition.
“If ETH goes up from here, it would only be due to Bitcoin going up a lot more.”
The widely followed analyst says that the Ethereum/Bitcoin (ETH/BTC) pair, on the other hand, is likely to keep falling under most circumstances based on history.
“So if Ethereum goes up, Ethereum/Bitcoin is probably going to keep going down. If Bitcoin goes sideways, Ethereum/Bitcoin is going to keep going down in my opinion. And if Bitcoin goes down, Ethereum/Bitcoin probably goes down because Bitcoin has been doing all s of things since 2022 began. In eight of 10 quarters, Ethereum/Bitcoin has gone down whether Bitcoin went up, down or sideways. Ethereum/Bitcoin generally went down.”
ETH is trading at $3,002 at time of writing.

Ripple's $10M Fine Proposal Dismissed by SEC as "Slap on the Wrist" | Cryptoglobe


                                
The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has firmly opposed Ripple’s claim that it should pay significantly lower fines in the ongoing legal dispute over the sale of XRP tokens. In a recent court filing, the SEC argued that Ripple’s proposed penalty of around $10 million would be a mere “slap on the wrist” compared to the nearly $2 billion fine the regulator has suggested.



The legal battle between the SEC and Ripple has been raging since December 2020, with the SEC accusing the company of raising $1.3 billion through sales of the XRP token, which it considers an unregistered security. On 13 July 2023, Judge Analisa Torres of New York ruled that some of Ripple’s programmatic sales of XRP did not violate securities laws due to a blind bid process in place. However, she also determined that other direct sales of the token to institutional investors were indeed securities.



In its opposition motion filed last month, Ripple contended that the fines should be much lower than the SEC’s proposed figure, suggesting that a fine of $10 million was much more appropriate given the circumstances than the nearly $2 billion, which the SEC is demanding. The SEC, however, maintains that Ripple’s suggested penalty would be inadequate and could encourage other crypto asset issuers to violate Section 5 of the Securities Act. The regulator’s lawyers argued that such a low fine would make it a “remarkably lucrative endeavor” for companies to disregard securities laws and deprive investors of the disclosures mandated by Congress.







            
            

            
            

            
            

        

The SEC also took issue with Ripple’s assurances to the court that it would not violate the law again in the future. Ripple pointed to various licenses it has obtained from different jurisdictions, some of which do not treat XRP sales as sales of securities. The SEC’s lawyers dismissed this argument, likening it to a New York restaurant claiming it doesn’t need a liquor license because it obtained a fishing license in California.



The SEC argues that Ripple’s claims of adhering to legal guidelines and restructuring its XRP sales in response to the court’s orders are inaccurate. According to the SEC, Ripple is misinterpreting the court’s orders and not fully acknowledging their compliance implications, thereby not justifying the avoidance of injunctions.



Yesterday, Ripple’s Chief Legal Officer, Stuart Alderoty, criticized the SEC on social media platform X for its handling of the ongoing lawsuit against Ripple. Alderoty accused the SEC of incorrectly applying the law and attempting to deceive the court. He expressed optimism about Ripple nearing the end of this legal battle while noting that others are just beginning to face similar challenges. He conveyed confidence in the court’s fairness in the upcoming remedies phase. Furthermore, Alderoty harshly criticized the SEC’s regard for international financial regulators, suggesting that the SEC dismisses the efforts of those who have established comprehensive cryptocurrency licensing frameworks, comparing them to mere fishing licenses.

“At @Tether_to Power we are proud of our collaboration with Swan Managed #Bitcoin Mining service. Swan has a super efficient team, which has managed a rapid increase in distributed hashrate and impressive reporting.”
Basically, with this partnership, Tether aims to expand its Bitcoin mining activities, choosing Swan for its performance. 
And indeed, it seems that since August 2023, Swan Mining has spent over 330 million dollars to increase its mining capacity to 7.5 EH. In anticipation, Swan would like to increase this capacity to 19.5 EH this year and to about 100 EH by 2026.
The new Swan Managed Bitcoin Mining service, just launched, allows institutional investors to commit a minimum of $100 million in the Bitcoin mining ecosystem. With this service, the company aims to offer customized mining operations tailored to the specific needs of its clients, such as Tether. 
At the moment, the amount of capital that Tether has decided to invest in the service has not been disclosed. 
Tether (USDT): the crypto company chooses Swan to expand its operations in Bitcoin mining
The new Swan service, Managed Mining Bitcoin, aims to be a new tailored approach for investors, including institutional ones. 
In this regard, Cory Klippsten, CEO of Swan, stated the following:
“Large capital allocators do not necessarily want to pool their capital with existing mining operations, nor are they able or interested in acquiring all the skills, talents, experience, and time to learn how to start their own mining operation. This is where Swan Managed Mining comes in. We can take a large amount of capital and deploy it quickly and efficiently into an investor-owned mining operation that meets their specific strategic requirements.”
At the same time, Tether has already dedicated significant capital to establish a major presence in Bitcoin mining, largely through Swan. 
This commitment from the crypto company behind the largest stablecoin USDT, aims to demonstrate the quality of execution and the financial attractiveness of Swan’s model for large capital allocators.
The latest news on crypto mining
Recently, it has been reported that crypto transaction fees have decreased after the halving event.
And indeed, in conjunction with the Bitcoin halving, transaction fees for cryptocurrencies had skyrocketed, reaching new all-time highs, much to the delight of mining operators. 
Such rates have dropped significantly by 75% in less than nine days after the event. 
At the same time, another news of these days involving the crypto mining sector, has revealed that Nvidia and other companies have experienced a boom in their stock prices.
The most representative stock of the American crypto mining industry is MARA of Marathon Holdings, which recorded a +18% daily increase, recovering from previous losses.

Bitcoin triggers hidden buy signal; Is BTC set for explosive rally?


Bitcoin (BTC) remains under pressure as the maiden cryptocurrency seeks to establish a sustained price movement above the $60,000 support level.
Amidst these circumstances, technical indicators suggest that Bitcoin might be on the verge of a price breakout. Particularly, in a TradingView post on May 8, crypto trading expert TradingShot drew attention to a potentially significant buy signal for Bitcoin that has largely gone unnoticed among investors.
The analysis highlighted the intersection of Bitcoin’s dominant circulating liquidity with high-yield corporate bonds. According to TradingShot, this metric has recently hit bottom and shows signs of rebounding, coinciding with consolidation or minor pullback in BTC’s price.

It’s worth noting that following Bitcoin’s sudden correction in early May, the crypto has gained to consolidate above $60,000, looking for a breakout towards $70,000. 
What’s particularly intriguing about the buy signal identified by the analyst is its historical correlation with Bitcoin’s price action. The analysis identified previous instances in September 2016, April 2020, and April 2024 where this combination of factors occurred, signaling the start of an upward rally.

“Every time this combination took place in the past (green circles), Bitcoin was accumulating and shortly after started the parabolic rally phase (green ellipse). This is basically one of the most consistent long-term buy signals you can get in the market,” the expert said. 

Bitcoin’s struggle to stay above $60,000
Amidst projections, Bitcoin is undergoing a critical test in maintaining its price above the $60,000 mark, while the $65,000 threshold looms as a crucial resistance level to monitor. 
Notably, Bitcoin’s current trajectory follows a bullish rebound at the previous week’s close, marking a significant recovery from its earlier dip to as low as $56,000 in early May.
Amid these fluctuations, a segment of market participants believe that the flagship cryptocurrency remains vulnerable to further declines before potentially embarking on a bullish trajectory reminiscent of the post-halving rallies.
For instance, as reported by Finbold, crypto analyst Plan B has forecasted that Bitcoin could reach $100,000 in the latter half of 2024. He emphasized that May 2024, the final month before the next halving cycle, could catalyze the forthcoming rally.
Bitcoin price analysis
By press time, Bitcoin price today was trading at $60,250, having undergone a correction of over 2% in the last 24 hours. On a weekly basis, BTC has surged by almost 6%.

Meanwhile, should bulls falter in maintaining Bitcoin’s price above $60,000, it could spell trouble for the cryptocurrency. Such a scenario would pave the way for a correction towards the $50,000 level.

EPAM Systems, Inc. (NYSE: EPAM), a global leader in digital transformation services, has reported its financial results for the first quarter ended March 31, 2024. The company announced first-quarter revenues of $1.165 billion, marking a 3.8% decrease year-over-year.



Despite the challenging demand environment, EPAM demonstrated resilience with GAAP income from operations at 9.5% of revenues and non-GAAP income from operations at 14.9%. The GAAP diluted earnings per share (EPS) increased by $0.24 to $1.97, while non-GAAP diluted EPS slightly decreased by $0.01 to $2.46. CEO Arkadiy Dobkin highlighted the company’s adaptability and ongoing investments in AI-enabled delivery and consulting to navigate the current market conditions.



The company’s performance in the first quarter also showed a strong cash flow, with $129.9 million generated from operating activities, compared to $87.3 million in the same period last year.



Additionally, EPAM continued its share repurchase program, buying back 396 thousand shares for $120.6 million. Despite a slight decrease in cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash, which totaled $1.990 billion as of March 31, 2024, the company’s financial position remains solid. As of the end of the quarter, the total headcount was approximately 52,800, including around 47,050 delivery professionals, underscoring EPAM’s commitment to maintaining a robust talent pool.



EPAM Beats Expectations in Q1



EPAM’s first-quarter performance did not fall short of expectations, with analysts projecting an EPS of $2.31 and revenue of $1.16 billion. The reported revenue of $1.165 billion was slightly above the anticipated figure, and the adjusted EPS of $2.46 exceeded the expected EPS.





EPM Expects Full-Year Revenues to Be Between $4.57 Billion to $4.67 Billion



Looking ahead, EPAM has updated its full-year outlook, now expecting revenues to be in the range of $4.575 billion to $4.675 billion, reflecting a year-over-year decline at the midpoint of the range. The company has also adjusted its expectations for GAAP diluted EPS to be in the range of $7.34 to $7.64 and has narrowed the expected range for non-GAAP diluted EPS to $10.00 to $10.30. For the second quarter, EPAM anticipates revenues to be between $1.135 billion and $1.145 billion, with GAAP diluted EPS in the range of $1.52 to $1.60 and non-GAAP diluted EPS between $2.21 and $2.29. These projections account for the ongoing challenges in the demand environment and EPAM’s strategic measures to optimize operations and invest in growth areas such as AI and digital transformation.

Jeo Boden Memecoin Explodes After Trump’s Reaction


							

The price of Jeo Boden (BODEN) surged significantly in the past 24 hours.



Billionaire Donald Trump recognized the meme coin in a public appearance. 



The market cap of BODEN memecoin stands at $251 million.




Jeo Boden (BODEN), a memecoin created from a misspelling of U.S. President Joe Biden’s name, skyrocketed in the past 24 hours after presidential candidate Donald Trump recognized the digital asset and talked about it in a public appearance. 



As per the data from CoinGecko, the price of the meme coin jumped almost 10% in the past 24 hours, with a 20.65% surge in trading volume. The market capitalization of the memecoin stands at $251 million.



Notably, former US President Trump hosted the Trump Cards NFT Gala for holders of the digital collection pioneered by the billionaire at his Mar-a-Lago resort in Palm Beach, Florida. At the event, the reality TV star was asked about the BODEN meme coin by a fan, who described the token to him. 



“I don’t like that investment,” Trump said in response to the sudden question asked by the fan. It is important to note that the meme coin peaked at $0.426 in the past 24 hours and, at the time of writing, is trading at $0.3527.









In a recent statement, Trump hinted at support for Bitcoin (BTC) and cryptocurrencies, which came as a surprise for the digital asset community since the billionaire is a Republican who is known to be staunch critic of virtual currencies. Additionally, Trump is also a strong critic of the central bank digital currency (CBDC) and has vowed to put an end to the Federal Reserve’s plans for a digital dollar if elected president.

Solana could surpass Ethereum in transaction fees

In a turn that could rewrite the current dynamics of the world of cryptocurrencies, Solana seems poised to surpass Ethereum in terms of transaction fees within the next week. 
This event, if it were to occur, would not only strengthen Solana’s positioning in the sector, but could also further solidify its label as an “Ethereum-killer”, despite the technical challenges and network interruptions it has recently faced.

Current context between Ethereum and Solana for transaction fees
Ethereum, long considered the undisputed leader in decentralized applications and decentralized finance (DeFi), is known for its high transaction fees, especially during network usage peaks. 
This has led many developers and users to seek cheaper and more efficient alternatives, a niche in which Solana has begun to stand out thanks to its promise of speed and significantly lower transaction costs.
Solana has made its way in the field of blockchain with the promise of processing up to 65,000 transactions per second, compared to a capacity of Ethereum which currently revolves around 30 transactions per second.
This performance is supported by a unique consensus model, known as Proof of History (PoH), which works in tandem with the Proof of Stake (PoS) mechanism to optimize efficiency and reduce costs.
Despite these advanced technical features, Solana has faced numerous network interruptions, raising doubts about its long-term reliability and scalability. 
These technical issues have temporarily hindered its growth and have shaken the confidence of some investors and users. However, recent improvements and updates to the network aim to solve these problems, restoring confidence in the platform.
Impact of reduced transaction fees
If Solana were to surpass Ethereum in terms of transaction fees, it could attract a significantly larger number of developers and projects.
This shift would not only increase the volume of transactions on the Solana network, but could also positively influence the value of its native token, SOL.
Furthermore, a reduction in fees could further democratize access to DeFi applications, making them available to a wider audience that may currently be discouraged by high fees on Ethereum.
Surpassing Ethereum will not be an easy task for Solana, given Ethereum’s vast user base and its extremely active developer community. 
Furthermore, the upcoming update of Ethereum, known as Ethereum 2.0, aims to solve many of its current issues related to scalability and transaction costs. 
However, temporary success in terms of lower transaction fees could give Solana the necessary advantage to solidify its position as a credible alternative to Ethereum in the long term.
Conclusion
In conclusion, Solana’s potential superiority over Ethereum in terms of transaction fees represents a significant turning point. If Solana manages to maintain lower transaction costs, it could not only attract a new wave of developers and users, but also consolidate its position as a valid alternative to Ethereum. 
This evolution highlights the continuous innovation in the field of blockchain and the need for existing platforms to adapt in order to remain competitive. However, the success of Solana will depend on its ability to overcome past technical challenges and build a stable and secure network. 
In a market that rewards both innovation and technical robustness, Solana has the opportunity to redefine the cryptocurrency landscape and demonstrate its value as a potential “Ethereum-killer” in the long term.

Andrew Tate Coin (ANDTATE) Will Explode 14,000% Ahead of MEXC Listing, as Shiba Inu, Bonk and Dogecoin Lag



                    

Early investors in memecoins like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Bonk (BONK), and Dogecoin (DOGE) made astronomical returns, and Andrew Tate Coin (ANDTATE) presents a similar opportunity for a limited time.



Andrew Tate Coin (ANDTATE), a newly launched Solana memecoin, is poised to explode over 14,000% in a matter of days, as former Shiba Inu (SHIB), Bonk (BONK) and Dogecoin (DOGE) investors pour funds into this new token. 




ANDTATE will be listed on MEXC, one of the largest centralized exchanges in the world, within a few days – and this is a massively bullish development for the token, as millions of new investors will easily be able to buy Andrew Tate Coin.



Currently, Andrew Tate Coin can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jupiter and Raydium, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. 



To buy ANDTATE on these platforms, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Andrew Tate Coin by entering its contract address – Cp7qyqdzXAqF7fqKXzS8LwTE7JQvh2V3vYGnDdx6j4ii – in the receiving field.




ANDTATE currently has a market cap of just under $20,000, meaning it has huge upside potential.



Early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and Bonk (BONK) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. 



If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner.

Consequence of the SEC Lawsuit: Ripple (XRP) Becomes Top-Trending Cryptocurrency


																TL;DR

XRP saw increased discussion rate, spurred by the SEC’s criticism of its upcoming stablecoin.
The asset has been quite popular in the past few years due to the ongoing lawsuit between Ripple and America’s securities regulator.


The Top 10 Club
The market intelligence platform – Santiment – presented the top 10 cryptocurrencies that have been involved in the most discussions lately. The first place belongs to the popular privacy token – Monero (XMR) – due to the disclosure that the peer-to-peer (P2P) trading platform LocalMonero halted operations. 
“Monero is being discussed at an abnormally high rate due to the announcement that LocalMonero is sunsetting as governments continue cracking down on XMR and other privacy focused assets,” the platform stated.
The second spot was occupied by Ripple’s XRP. The token’s popularity surged following the latest bashing manifest from the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), which labeled the company’s upcoming stablecoin an “unregistered crypto asset.”
The largest cryptocurrencies by market capitalization Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) followed next, while Ethena (USDe) rounded up the top 5 list.
SuperVerse (SUPER), Chia (XCH), Kaspa (KAS), IDEX (IDEX), and Celsius Network (CEL) are the other coins included in Santiment’s ranking.




XRP on the Spotlight for Another Reason
The seventh-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization has been a top-trending topic for many years mainly because of the Ripple v SEC lawsuit, which is centered on its classification.
It often experiences significant volatility following important developments surrounding the case. For example, XRP’s price exploded by over 70% in a matter of hours after Ripple’s first partial court victory in 2023.
The legal spat entered its trial phase in April this year, with many industry participants expecting an impressive rally for the asset in the event of a decisive win for the firm. Those willing to dive deeper into the specifics of the lawsuit and its potential impact on XRP, feel free to take a look at our dedicated video below:

Binance denies reports of DWF Labs market manipulation

Binance has denied the latest allegations surrounding alleged market manipulation from DWF Labs.Allegations over DWF Labs’s alleged market manipulation have reemerged. An anonymous source claiming to be a former Binance insider said that Binance investigators uncovered $300 million worth of wash trading from DWF during 2023, according to a May 9 WSJ report.When asked about the market manipulation incident, Binance denied the reports. A Binance spokesperson told Cointelegraph:“Binance emphatically rejects any assertion that its market surveillance program has permitted market manipulation on our platform. We have a robust market surveillance framework that identifies and takes action against market abuse. Any users that breach our terms of use are off-boarded; we do not tolerate market abuse.”According to the WSJ report, DWF Labs’ manipulated the price of the Yield Guild Game (YGG) token and at least six other cryptocurrencies last year. However, Binance said that its surveillance program would make this impossible.Binance is actively banning traders that showcase signs of market manipulation, a spokesperson told Cointelegraph:“Over the last three years, we have offboarded nearly 355,000 users with a transaction volume of more than $2.5 trillion for violating our terms of use.”Investigating potential market manipulation is a top priority for Binance, the world's largest exchange, which is also evidenced by independent investigations, Binance's spokesperson added:"A recent independent investigation from Inca Digital into Binance’s market surveillance practices validates the effectiveness of our approach, finding 'minimal signs of anomalous trading activities.'"Related: Public blockchain ledgers ‘not fit for purpose,’ says JPMorgan execDWF Labs, a Web3 investment and market-making firm, was first hit by market manipulation allegations last September after high-volume on-chain activity raised the eyebrows of crypto investors.Wintermute, an algorithmic trading firm and market maker, was among the first companies to accuse DWF Labs of crypto market manipulation. During a September interview at Token2049, Wintermute co-founder Yoann Turpin said that DWF Labs “are not market makers in our sense” and confuse users because they “declare what are essentially [over-the-counter] trades as investments.”Andrei Grachev, the co-founder of DWF Labs, has strongly denied the allegations.Related: Trader loses 7-figure sum due to 0L Network hard fork

“The Way Gensler Runs the SEC, Is Like He’s Invited You To Play Baseball, but No One Knows the Rules”, Says Veteran Crypto Investor | Cryptoglobe


                                
Recently, Alex Svanevik, CEO of Nansen, and veteran crypto investor Adam Cochran voiced their concerns on social media platform X regarding the current regulatory climate under U.S. SEC Chair Gary Gensler. Their analogies paint a vivid picture of what many in the crypto community perceive as arbitrary and opaque regulatory enforcement.



Alex Svanevik likened the SEC’s regulatory approach to a road with no speed signs, where Gary Gensler plays the role of a capricious traffic officer who issues speeding tickets at whim. This analogy underscores a common complaint among crypto businesses and enthusiasts: the lack of clear guidelines. Just as drivers on a road without signs would be uncertain about the speed limit, crypto companies operate in an environment where the rules seem unclear and enforcement unpredictable. Svanevik’s critique suggests a need for clearer regulatory signs to guide market participants.



Adam Cochran offered a more elaborate scenario, comparing Gensler’s management of the SEC to a disorganized baseball game where the rules are not only unclear but seemingly subject to the whims of the umpire, Gensler himself. In Cochran’s metaphor, Gensler invites players to a game, encourages them to ask about the rules, but then refuses to clarify them. This leads to arbitrary enforcement, as illustrated by Gensler punishing players unpredictably, sometimes violently with a baseball bat, for actions they believed were within the rules.







            
            

            
            

            
            

        

Cochran’s narrative escalates with Gensler punishing successful players and threatening them, showing favoritism to a seemingly compliant but inept team (“Prometheus”), and ultimately abandoning the game when faced with challenges. This portrayal taps into deeper industry frustrations over perceived inequities and the erratic application of regulations, which Cochran suggests could stifle innovation and fairness in the crypto sector.



Both analogies reflect a broader sentiment within the crypto community that the SEC, under Gensler’s leadership, has failed to provide the necessary regulatory clarity that is crucial for the healthy development of the cryptocurrency market. These criticisms highlight a desire for regulation that is not only clear and fair but also constructively engages with industry advancements and challenges.

The rise and fall of LocalMonero | Protos


The co-founder of LocalMonero, Alex Daneo, announced on Reddit that he will be ceasing operations after almost 7 years. Like the also-defunct LocalBitcoins service for bitcoin (BTC), LocalMonero helped facilitate peer-to-peer trading of monero (XMR), a private-by-default cryptocurrency. Daneo cited “internal and external factors” that made it difficult to sustain LocalMonero’s operations.
Most people in the crypto industry interpreted those “factors” to be recent news developments: namely the criminal indictment of Samourai Wallet’s co-founders, and a public service announcement about non-KYC crypto money transmitters from the FBI. Those events sent a clear message: “Beware of financial services that do not ask for KYC information including name, date of birth, address, and ID before allowing you to send or receive money or cryptocurrency.”
Similarly to LocalMonero, the FBI-seized Samourai Wallet was a service for privacy-conscious users to swap money with ties to their identity for anonymized crypto assets. Although LocalMonero emphasized cash fiat for XMR, whereas Samourai was mostly BTC-for-BTC mixing, the primary value proposition was similar. Both services attracted users who wanted to pay a small fee to anonymize their money.
In the wake of those dual announcements by the US Justice Department and FBI, many privacy services and coin mixers have suspended operations. 

Phoenix Wallet, a Bitcoin Lightning and privacy service, suspended key operations.
Wasabi, Samourai’s European competitor, terminated its coinjoin coordinator.
AgoraDesk, also co-founded by Alex Daneo, is winding down operations.
Kraken recently ceased delisted monero in Ireland and Belgium.

The LocalMonero team will spend the next six months winding down operations. Users will allegedly have until November 7, 2024 to withdraw their funds.

Unknown volume, unknown impact of LocalMonero shutdown
Because LocalMonero merely facilitated meetups between buyers and sellers interested in peer-to-peer trades, it is difficult to find trading volumes facilitated by LocalMonero. Most actual transactions of XMR for cash probably took place off the platform entirely.
Because of its purposeful opacity, ranking websites CoinMarketCap and CoinGecko never bothered to add LocalMonero to its leaderboard of crypto exchanges – even though it was a real, mostly fiat-for-crypto exchange.
There is some circumstantial evidence that the volume was quite low at times. Five years ago, one user mentioned on Reddit that no monero seller was available on the site at that time.
In the early days, LocalMonero seemed to have a promising future. Alex announced the addition of a Tor single onion service early in LocalMonero’s existence. It also added an I2P domain and B32 I2P domain at around the same time. Generally speaking, it received good reviews from users. One user called it “easier than Coinbase.”
Users still have time to wrap up their activities and withdraw funds. LocalMonero is pulling the plug for good on November 7, 2024.

Stablecoins on Bitcoin coming soon, says Lightning Labs CEO

Stablecoins running on Bitcoin are edging closer to reality through new functionality built by Lightning Labs using the network’s Taproot upgrade implemented in late 2021.Elizabeth Stark, CEO of Lightning Labs, unpacked the latest development from the Bitcoin development firm at FT Live’s Crypto and Digital Assets summit in London. The firm's co-founder also gave an eloquent explainer of Bitcoin and the Lightning Network to an audience of traditional finance players.Lightning Labs co-founder Elizabeth Stark on stage at FT Live: Source: Gareth JenkinsonLightning Labs’ Taproot Assets protocol is building functionality to bring stablecoins and tokenized assets to Bitcoin. According to Stark, developers have made significant headway toward this goal, culminating in the testing of transactions on Lightning:“We released an early part of the code in October and recently demoed the first-ever transaction on Lightning of an asset. The idea is to have crypto dollars and stablecoins on the Bitcoin blockchain.”Stark added that traditionally, these digital assets have operated on other blockchains that have suffered from high fees and other issues. She argues that Bitcoin’s network is perhaps best placed to facilitate the use of stablecoins because it “is the most secure and decentralized” blockchain.Bitcoin and stablecoins value as a store of valueStark went on to discuss the merits of Bitcoin (BTC) and stablecoins as a store of value, especially in nations grappling with inflation issues and devaluing fiat currencies.The Lightning Labs CEO said stablecoin adoption has grown dramatically since the COVID-19 pandemic, with users largely being based in emerging markets.“The stickiest users have been those looking for a stable store of value. In some cases, they’re using Bitcoin. In other cases, they’re using stablecoins, and in some cases, it’s a combination of both,” Stark explained.Related: What is the Bitcoin Lightning Network, and how does it work?The two largest stablecoin players, Tether (USDT) and Circle (USDC), hold more United States Treasury bonds combined than major nations like Germany and South Korea. Stark said this is an intriguing fact given that end users don’t benefit from the interest from holding stablecoins.For those in countries grappling with hyperinflation or precarious economic environments, the choice of holding a stablecoin is driven by the need for a store of value.Lightning-powered stablecoins will be superiorGiven the significant growth in value of the stablecoin market, Stark said there is a need for the infrastructure to enable the issuance of stablecoins and real world assets on the Bitcoin blockchain.“That’s why we’re building this protocol, this technology right now. We’re not issuing assets, we’re building the rails. Asset issuers will use our technology to issue real-world tokenized assets,” Stark explained.Related: Coinbase integrates Lightning Network for Bitcoin transactionsThe CEO added that financial institutions could issue gold assets, stablecoins and other fiat-backed assets on Bitcoin and then transact over the Lightning Network. Perhaps most telling was the relative cost compared to other blockchains and conventional traditional finance systems which Stark highlighted:“If you look at Visa where fees in the U.S. can be upward of 3%, or even or 1% the fees, transacting with stablecoins on Lightning can be dramatically lower, a cent or less than that.”Stark added that this could competitively enable people to transact globally at far lower rates than through traditional networks.

Bitcoin Struggles with Range Lows Amid Post-Halving Market Boredom



                    

Bitcoin‘s price experienced a test of its range lows on May 8, with the cryptocurrency sector marked by a general sentiment of “boredom” following the recent halving event. 



The price of Bitcoin (BTC) sagged towards $62,000 during the Asia session, as data from Cointelegraph Markets Pro and TradingView revealed. 




This marked a retreat from a brief rebound that had seen BTC surpass $65,500 just days before, followed by a 5% retracement that entrenched it within a trading range established prior to the weekend.



The closing price for the day hovered around $62,300, positioning BTC/USD perilously close to forfeiting more of its recent gains. 



According to J. A. Maartunn, a CryptoQuant analyst, “Any daily close below $62,100 or prolonged inactivity counts as a stop-loss,” highlighting the precarious position of the market.




Michaël van de Poppe, CEO of MNTrading, voiced his frustration over the stagnant market movement since the halving in mid-April, stating, “Bitcoin slowly proceeds towards the lower boundaries of the range for a test of support,” and added, “After that, it seems likely we’ll continue the upwards grind.

“Boredom has started since the Bitcoin halving took place.”



The commentary was mirrored by fellow trader Moustache, who remained optimistic about future prospects, noting that these movements are typical precursors to a more substantial rally. 




“The last dips before $BTC starts the next leg imo,” he observed, likening the current patterns to those seen in 2017 and 2020.



“Concurrently, the exchange-traded fund (ETF) sector for cryptocurrencies experienced a mix of reactions. 



Following the report of significant inflows exceeding $500 million in previous days, Bitcoin ETFs in the U.S. recorded a day of net outflows on May 7, totaling $15.7 million. 



This was a stark contrast and highlighted the volatility and uncertainty prevailing in the market. 



Furthermore, Grayscale, a major player in the space, retracted plans for an Ether futures ETF product, signaling potential shifts in strategic focus or market sentiment.



These developments illustrate the complex dynamics at play in the cryptocurrency markets, where investor sentiment can quickly shift, influenced by regulatory actions, market movements, or broader economic factors.

Starknet to bring on AI agents that can carry out on-chain activity

Ethereum layer-2 blockchain Starknet will soon allow artificial intelligence (AI) agents on its blockchain that can autonomously perform on-chain activities for users, such as optimizing yield and re-allocating portfolios.Giza — a firm aiming to bring AI to blockchains — raised $3 million in a pre-seed round led by CoinFund in July 2023 and is spearheading the effort. Co-founder Renç Korzay told Cointelegraph that AI agents would be deployed on Starknet by the end of June, with other chains to follow.Korzay said the agents could take over four activities, the first being yield aggregating — finding “where the highest return is and depositing to different yield avenues.”Later releases will see the AI agents also be a “robo-advisor and figure out the best portfolio allocation for a user given their risk appetite,” said Korzay.In the beta phase, the Giza team will be auditing and approving agent strategies to ensure security. In the future, Agents will become completely permissionless through the Giza Protocol, which will provide both cryptographic and cryptoeconomic security to ensure a trust-minimized exchange between developers and users.They can also autonomously provide liquidity on decentralized exchanges or make leveraged price bets and “predict price movements,” adjusting crypto holdings “based on the strategy set by the user,” he added. The yield-optimizing AI agents will be the first to deploy, with the other types to follow, according to a May 9 press release shared with Cointelegraph.It’s billed as “low-cost and low-computation,” and it can max out returns by buying or selling assets so they stay at the same weighting in a portfolio on lending platforms that it can directly use and sign off on transactions.“As all accounts on Starknet are smart contracts — via the network’s native account abstraction features — this allows for proofs to be verified directly within the contract,” Giza explained. Three-month Starknet active users chart. March saw activity spike as it conducted a token airdrop. Source: StarkscanThe AI models are built with the Starknet programming language Cairo and “verify complex computations” using Zero-Knowledge Scalable Transparent Argument of Knowledge and zero-knowledge proofs (ZK-proofs) created by Starknet development firm StarkWare.ZK-proofs allow for information to be shared and authenticated while maintaining user privacy.Related: Philosopher Yuval Noah Harari warns of AI’s risks in financeGiza co-founder Cem Dagdelen said in a statement the company expects agents will “become the new application layer for Web3, abstracting away smart contract risks and complexities from users.”However, the agents aren’t limited to just crypto and blockchain. According to Giza, they can also help “highly regulated sectors” cut oversight costs by using models to check “the validity of their outputs.”Ava Labs founder Emin Gün Sirer said at a recent blockchain conference he thinks AI-backed smart contract coding is five to 10 years away and, when it arrives, could “onboard billions of new [blockchain] users.”Meanwhile, Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin has cautioned developers that it’s “worth treading carefully” when adding AI to blockchains, saying AI can help humans understand what is happening on-chain, but it shouldn’t be tasked with enforcing smart contract rules.Magazine: How to control the AIs and incentivize the humans with crypto

EU seeks stakeholder opinions on adding crypto to 12T euro investment market

The European Union security watchdog, the European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA), is seeking the opinion of experts on whether to add crypto to the 12 trillion euro ($12.8 trillion) investment product market.The ESMA asked industry experts for their views on whether Undertakings for Collective Investment in Transferable Securities (UCITS) — an investment product market valued at 12 trillion euros — can gain exposure to different asset classes such as structured or leveraged loans, catastrophe bonds, emission allowances, commodities, crypto assets and unlisted equities.UCITS are a class of investment funds comprising products intended to protect and simplify investing transactions. UCITS are often comprised of mutual, exchange-traded or money market funds. EU regulations govern these funds; however, non-EU investors can also gain exposure. UCITS stakeholders have until Aug. 7 to submit their comments. If approved, UCITS would become one of the largest mainstream funds with crypto exposure. The request for expert opinions comes amid the approval of spot Bitcoin (BTC) exchange-traded funds in the United States and Hong Kong, with securities regulators worldwide appearing to warm up to crypto exposure in traditional investment vehicles. Related: The Runes protocol will ignite a new season for Bitcoin after the halvingWhile spot BTC ETFs are solely crypto-focused, UCITS investments are divided into numerous fund types, each with a particular asset allocation based on the fund’s risk profile. If approved, there won’t be an independent UCITS fund with 100% crypto allocation but multiple UCITS funds with a percentage allocation in crypto. EU regulations currently prohibit independent crypto-centered investment products. Thus, investors have to access them via exchange-traded notes.The European Union is known for its strict crypto regulatory policy. It is one of the first regions to introduce a complete crypto regulatory framework in the form of its Markets in Crypto-Assets Regulation (MiCA). One of the questions asked by the ESMA in the feedback is how adding specific cryptocurrencies to the framework would or wouldn’t be affected by MiCA.Magazine: What do crypto market makers actually do?

How is Litecoin a Winner? LTC Leads As Most Widely-Used Coin for Payments and Simple Transactions | Cryptopolitan

Litecoin (LTC) is fulfilling precisely the use case of its initial vision – to become a fast, cheep tool for payments. For that reason, LTC is once again the winner when it comes to just moving funds. The Litecoin network has relatively low fees, while also offering growing security through mining.Litecoin is also one of the most active coins on BitPay even in comparison to Bitcoin (BTC). Only two years ago, Litecoin made up 25% of payments on BitPay locations, extending its share since then.Litecoin is also traded on most major exchanges and can be used for moving funds between wallets. While Litecoin has rallied in the past, it also trades in a relatively predictable way, also serving as a predictable payment tool.Litecoin Seen as an Investment Wild CardLTC is currently consolidating around $81.50, surviving the last few corrections with relatively low downside. This time, LTC has not rallied to an outsized gain, but also avoided deep corrections.While LTC is convenient for spending, there are also signs of accumulation, while waiting for a bigger breakout. LTC was one of the earliest assets to go mainstream through the Grayscale funds. Currently, the funds are matching the market price, while growing their LTC reserves.BitPay Drives Litecoin AdoptionLitecoin is available on most wallets, but only some apps are active for web-based spending. BitPay facilitates the Litecoin turnover by offering ways to spend the coin within the Internet ecosystem. Gift cards and e-commerce gateways are some specific ways that BitPay makes the Litecoin option available.As of April 2024, over 37% of all Litecoin payments are going through the BitPay wallet. Trust Wallet and Exodus are also important due to their user-friendly features. These two wallets make up 45% of all LTC coin transfers. There is a small community of users still hanging onto the Litecoin Core wallet, and under 3% use Coinbase wallet.BitPay also grows the Litecoin network by connecting its owners with hundreds of merchants in its growing selection. BitPay aims to unite the crypto payment potential with the wider fintech ecosystem, finding viable use cases for its portfolio of assets. Recently, BitPay also partnered with MoonPay to add more fiat spending options.For that reason, BitPay mostly uses a small selection of assets, limiting itself to blue chip coins and some of the most common stablecoins.BitPay handled more than 341K crypto transactions for the past three months and more than 54K in April alone. BitPay connects those transactions to real-world goods and services, even though this number may be relatively low compared to overall network activity.The Litecoin community is a mix of long-term holders and active users. About 30% of the LTC supply is active in a 24-hour period.On an hourly basis, there are close to 10K transactions on average. LTC is also relatively scarce after miners produced the first 75M coins. There are about 9M coins left to produce, which will include a series of halvings every four years. Litecoin has already completed 11 years without network outages or significant attacks, proving its reliability.Due to this reason, Litecoin serves as a preferred choice for mid-range transactions, typically with a value of around 108 LTC. The network also carries multiple small transactions of around 1 LTC.In addition to LTC production, the miners are also supporting the Dogecoin (DOGE) blockchain, where the total DOGE produced is not limited.Litecoin Active Addresses Going StrongLitecoin active addresses respond to market trends. From the start of Q2, the Litecoin network has on average around 300K daily active wallets, with spikes in daily activity. On the most active day of 2024, more than 1.3M wallets were active, coinciding with peak market valuations.Another sign of network health is the mining activity. The average Litecoin hashrate went up around 30% in the past 12 months, surpassing one PetaHash per second.Litecoin’s network is profitable to mine at scale even at the current market price, offering miners highly liquid rewards.

                        Crypto hedge fund Pantera Capital has reiterated its bullish stance on Bitcoin, predicting a potential surge in price to $114,000 by August 2025.The forecast comes as the industry grapples with challenges such as inflation concerns, Federal Reserve interest rate policies, and the escalating Middle East crisis.In its latest report, Pantera Capital revisited its analysis from November 2022, which examined Bitcoin’s past performance before and after its most recent halving event.
Pantera Uses Stock-to-Flow Model to Predict Bitcoin Price
Utilizing a stock-to-flow model, Pantera assessed the supply of Bitcoin in relation to the rate of new production, which is designed to decrease by 50% every four years during halving events.Historical data shows that Bitcoin’s price has experienced significant increases, sometimes up to 93-fold, in response to these events.By studying both pre-halving and post-halving rallies, Pantera Capital determined that, on average, prices tend to reach their peak approximately 2.6 years after halving events.Based on this analysis, the projected timeframe for Bitcoin’s potential surge aligns with August next year.While the stock-to-flow model is not an exact science, it has gained popularity within the crypto industry as a tool to evaluate the intrinsic value of Bitcoin.Pantera Capital’s forecast joins a chorus of other optimistic predictions for Bitcoin.Research firm Bernstein has set a target of $150,000 by mid-2025, while Anthony Scaramucci, founder of Skybridge Capital, envisions a price of $170,000 or higher next year. Fundstrat Global Advisors’ Thomas Lee has also expressed the possibility of Bitcoin reaching $150,000 in 2024 and even $500,000 over the next five years.
Bitcoin Sees Heightened Volatility
Bitcoin closed the week at approximately $64,000, representing a 1.4% increase from the previous week’s closing value of around $63,100.The week was marked by heightened volatility, with prices initially dipping significantly to around $56,500 on Wednesday before rebounding above $60,000 by Friday.While Bitcoin ETFs experienced net outflows for the fourth consecutive week, the period of outflows may have peaked, Matteo Greco, a research analyst at digital asset investment firm Fineqia International, said in a recent note.He added that trading volume for Bitcoin ETFs remained relatively steady during the week, with cumulative trading volume since inception reaching $246.6 billion.During the week alone, trading volume amounted to $10.9 billion, a 12.3% increase from the previous week.However, these figures still fall below the average trading volume of $3.1 billion since the inception of Bitcoin ETFs.“These figures suggest that the period of outflows may have peaked, with trading volumes showing signs of increase and outflows potentially stabilizing,” he wrote.Furthermore, following a four-month period of consistent outflows, Grayscale’s spot Bitcoin ETF finally witnessed a positive shift. On Friday, May 3, the downward trajectory was reversed when GBTC experienced its first inflow of $63 million.As a result, the overall spot Bitcoin ETF market saw net positive inflows of $378.3 million after seven days of continuous outflows.The trend continued on Monday, May 6, as GBTC recorded its second inflow of $3.9 million, bringing the total inflows to $66.9 million.

Vitalik Buterin proposes multidimensional gas framework for Ethereum | Cryptopolitan

Ethereum‘s gas system, a core component for computing transaction costs, is set for a significant overhaul. Vitalik Buterin has put forth a bold proposal to introduce a multidimensional gas framework, aimed at addressing the current system’s limitations.The Current Gas System and Its ChallengesVitalik told us that Ethereum currently uses a unified gas system where various computational efforts—like processing, storage operations, data transmission, and cryptographic proofs—are all quantified under the single metric of “gas.”Source: Vitalik ButerinFor instance, a typical transaction might cost 47,085 gas, broken down into base costs, data inclusion, storage interactions, and execution efforts. Although this system simplifies market operations and fee calculations, it merges fundamentally different types of resources, which can be problematic.Vitalik explained that this blending leads to inefficiencies because it treats distinct network resources as if they were interchangeable. This misconception can result in the network either rejecting safe transaction blocks or accepting potentially harmful ones due to inappropriate gas limit settings. He believes that moving to a multidimensional gas model could better represent the true limits and capabilities of the network, potentially boosting throughput by not oversimplifying the resource interchangeability.Introducing Multidimensional GasThe concept of multidimensional gas isn’t entirely new, as Vitalik highlighted its active implementation with EIP-4844. This enhancement introduces “blobs” for rollup data, which significantly lowers transaction costs on layer 2 solutions. By allowing separate caps and fees for data and computation, Ethereum can handle more substantial and complex operations without compromising network integrity.Vitalik told us about the challenges of large block sizes and their impact on Ethereum’s scalability. He mentioned that before the recent reforms, even a minor reduction in data costs could dangerously increase the maximum block size, straining the network. The introduction of blobs addresses this by setting distinct limits and costs for different types of data, which has already made operations like rollups far cheaper and increased transaction volumes significantly.The Future of Ethereum’s Gas SystemLooking ahead, Vitalik believes the next big challenge will be integrating stateless clients, which require a network to process transactions without storing every piece of state data on every node. This approach would benefit greatly from a more refined gas model where different types of data and operations are priced according to their actual demands on the system.However, the real potential for a multidimensional gas system lies in its flexibility to manage different network resources independently. For example, state growth could be managed under its pricing model, distinct from transaction processing or data storage, allowing the network to adapt more dynamically to changing demands.Vitalik is optimistic about the benefits of this system but recognizes the complexities involved, especially when it comes to transaction execution and sub-calls within the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM). Each type of transaction could potentially require its gas metrics, complicating the design and execution of smart contracts.Despite these challenges, he is convinced that the advantages—particularly in terms of scalability and efficiency—justify the effort. With careful implementation, a multidimensional gas system could make Ethereum more robust and flexible, better suited to meet the demands of its diverse user base.

'Rich Dad Poor Dad' Author Kiyosaki Shares Key Bitcoin Revelation Amid Crucial Warning


In a recent social media update, popular author Robert Kiyosaki, best known for his "Rich Dad Poor Dad" book, has provided a crucial insight into the current economic landscape, while issuing a stern warning to his followers. The focal point of his message revolves around the potential of Bitcoin amid an ominous forecast of impending economic depression.Kiyosaki's latest post underscores his belief that being prepared for adverse financial conditions is paramount. Urging his audience to move away from the metaphorical "Disneyland" of financial ignorance, Kiyosaki advocates for proactive measures to secure wealth, notably through astute investments in tangible assets like gold, silver and the increasingly prominent cryptocurrency, BTC."Best time to get rich"In a thought-provoking twist, Kiyosaki reflects on his previous thesis regarding economic downturns as opportunities for wealth accumulation. He highlights the need to break away from the illusion of prosperity and confront the harsh realities of economic cycles. For Kiyosaki, the looming prospect of depression serves as a catalyst for proactive wealth-building, urging individuals to seize the moment and prepare diligently for the road ahead. This is not the first time Kiyosaki has sounded the alarm bells about economic instability. He posits that amid fear, doubt and uncertainty, Bitcoin stands out as a beacon of potential wealth accumulation, citing its resilience in the face of inflationary pressures and currency devaluation.Of particular interest is Kiyosaki's bullish stance on Bitcoin's price future trajectory. Forecasts of its value skyrocketing to staggering heights, including predictions of it reaching $120,000 by year's end and a jaw-dropping half-million mark in the following year, have garnered attention and sparked discussions in financial circles.

Ethereum Foundation's 1,000 ETH Transfer Raises Eyebrows


								Ethereum, the second-largest digital asset by market capitalization, has been under the spotlight once again. Recent movements of ETH by the Ethereum Foundation have stirred concerns among market observers, igniting debates about potential volatility in Ethereum’s price.

Foundation’s Massive ETH Transfers
The Ethereum Foundation’s series of transfers to the multisign address “0xbc9” have captured the attention of crypto enthusiasts. According to reports from Spot On Chain, the foundation has transferred a total of 5,000 ETH to this address since the start of 2024. The latest transaction, involving 1,000 ETH valued at $3 million, has added fuel to the ongoing discussion.

Market Speculation Amidst Resistance Levels
Against the backdrop of the crypto’s struggle to breach the $3,200 resistance level, the current market environment amplifies the apprehension. ETH hovers below $3,000 per coin, prompting speculation about whether the foundation’s actions could exacerbate the downward trend. Some analysts even predict a potential drop in ETH’s price to $2,500, adding to the market’s uncertainty.

Market Impact Analysis
A considerable percentage of the ETH supplied to the address—specifically, 1,76 ETH—was quickly sold for 4.80 million DAI, averaging $2,72 per ETH. However, these sales frequently correspond with a drop in ETH price, raising suspicions about possible price manipulation.
Historical data further supports these concerns, indicating a correlation between the foundation’s sell-offs and downward pressure on ETH’s price. With the multisign address currently holding 2,508 ETH, equivalent to $7.51 million, market participants are treading cautiously, wary of the implications for the coin’s value.

Developments In The Ethereum Ecosystem
Despite the market turbulence, the ETH ecosystem continues to evolve. Recent developments, including Ethereum Improvement Proposals (EIPs), reflect the community’s efforts to enhance the network’s functionality and scalability. Notably, EIP-7702 has emerged as an alternative to EIP-3074, showcasing the community’s commitment to addressing the altcoin’s challenges.

Moreover, Ethereum’s transition from a Proof-of-Work (PoW) to a Proof-of-Stake (PoS) consensus mechanism remains a focal point. The network’s inflationary dynamics following the Dencun upgrade in March have sparked discussions about its long-term sustainability.
The burning of gas fees post-Merge has led to a notable reduction in the growth of ETH’s circulating supply, signaling a significant shift in the crypto’s economic model.
Looking Ahead
As the crypto community braces for what lies ahead, all eyes remain glued to Ethereum’s price chart, eagerly awaiting clues about the next move of the leading altcoin. Amidst market uncertainties, Ethereum’s potential rally gathers attention, with reports suggesting a resurgence in momentum.
With intriguing updates expected on the ETH blockchain and ongoing discussions about its future direction, the Ethereum community remains resilient, navigating through the ever-changing landscape of digital assets.

ADA’s price increased by more than 4% in the last 24 hours. 
Most metric sand investor sentiment looked bullish on ADA.

Cardano’s [ADA] performance in the last few hours was one of the best among the top 10 cryptos. This has pushed ADA’s price to a critical level, as it was on the verge of breaking out of a bull pattern. 
Cardano prepares for a rally
World Of Charts, a popular crypto analyst, recently posted a tweet highlighting a bullish pattern that formed on ADA’s chart. As per the tweet, ADA’s price reached the upper trendline of a bullish flag pattern. 
A successful breakout above that mark could result in explosive growth. In fact, the tweet mentioned that a breakout could allow ADA to touch $1 in the coming weeks. 
ADA’s price action backed this possibility, as it was one of the top gains among the top 10 cryptos. According to CoinMarketCap, Cardano was up by more than 4% in the last 24 hours. 
At the time of writing, ADA was trading at $0.4603 with a market capitalization of over $16.4 billion, making it the 10th largest crypto. 
The token’s trading volume also surged by 74% along with its price, which is usually a positive signal. 
AMBCrypto then took a look at Santiment’s data to see whether metrics were supporting this price uptick. We found that ADA’s Funding Rate declined slightly on the 9th of May.
 This was bullish, as prices generally move in the opposite direction from funding rates. 
Its velocity was high, meaning that ADA was used more often in transactions within a set time frame. Another bullish metric was the MVRV ratio, which improved sharply thanks to ADA’s recent price uptick.

What’s next for ADA?
Apart from these, investors’ confidence in Cardano also increased in the last few hours. As per our look at Santiment’s data, ADA’s Weighted Sentiment went in the positive zone. 
This meant that bullish sentiment around the token increased. 
Its Social Volume also spiked, reflecting a rise in the token’s popularity in the crypto space.

A few of the technical indicators also looked optimistic. For instance, the MACD displayed a bullish advantage in the market. 
The Relative Strength Index (RSI) registered an uptick, indicating a further increase in price, which might allow ADA to break above the bull pattern.

If a breakout happens, then the first test of ADA will be near its immediate resistance at $0.518. 
However, the Chaikin Money Flow (CMF) registered a sharp downtick, which hinted that ADA’s bull rally might not last and ADA might plummet to its support at $0.43.

Spot Bitcoin ETFs Clock $11M Net Inflows On Wednesday As Grayscale Shifts Focus To Spot Ether ETF - Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (BTC) Common Units of fractional undivided beneficial interest (ARCA:GBTC) - Benzinga

Spot Bitcoin ETFs saw modest inflows on May 8, with the $11.5409 million inflow into the Bitwise ETF BITB being the only non-zero balance of the day.What Happened: Notably, Grayscale’s GBTC GBTC, BlackRock‘s iShares Bitcoin Trust IBIT, the Fidelity Wise Origin Bitcoin Fund FBTC and Ark’s ARKB ARKB reported neither inflows nor outflows on Wednesday.The total net asset value of Bitcoin spot ETFs now stands at $51.504 billion, indicating robust investor interest and confidence in cryptocurrency as a viable asset class, according to data from SoSo Value.In related developments, Grayscale Investments, a leading player in the cryptocurrency investment space, is shifting its focus towards enhancing its spot exchange-traded products, particularly its Ethereum trust. This strategic pivot was confirmed by CEO Michael Sonnenshein during a Financial Times event in London.Sonnenshein emphasized the company's core commitment to spot products, aligning with Grayscale’s foundational strategy. He said, "At Grayscale we decided to focus our energy on our spot products. That's really core to our DNA."Also Read: Are Bitcoin Whales Buying The Dip With Less Enthusiasm?Why It Matters: This announcement comes on the heels of Grayscale withdrawing its application for an Ether futures ETF, a decision influenced by the existing abundance of futures products in the market and the competitive nature of the Ethereum ETF sector.Notably, products such as VanEck's EFUT and ProShares' EETH currently dominate the market, capturing over 90% of the total trading volume at their launches.The strategic realignment by Grayscale underscores a broader trend within the crypto investment community, where focus is increasingly shifting towards spot-based offerings rather than futures, possibly due to investor demand for direct exposure to cryptocurrencies rather than derivative products.What’s Next: These developments in the cryptocurrency investment sphere will be among the key topics discussed at the upcoming Benzinga’s Future of Digital Assets event on Nov. 19.The event will explore the implications of recent inflows into Bitcoin ETFs and the strategic shifts by major asset managers like Grayscale. Attendees can expect to gain valuable insights into the dynamics of cryptocurrency investments, the evolving landscape of ETF products, and the future trajectory of digital assets within the broader financial market.Read Next: Major Trading Firm Purchased $1B Worth Of Bitcoin ETFs In Q1Image: Shutterstock

Vitalik Unveils Multidimensional Gas Pricing for Ethereum: What It Means for User | Cryptoglobe


                                
In a blog post dated May 9, 2024, Ethereum’s co-founder Vitalik Buterin introduced an innovative concept to address efficiency issues within Ethereum’s transaction processing system. His proposal revolves around the idea of “multidimensional gas pricing,” which aims to optimize how Ethereum manages and prices computational tasks.



Simplifying Ethereum’s Gas Mechanism



In Ethereum, “gas” refers to the unit that measures the amount of computational effort required to execute operations like transactions and smart contracts. Traditionally, Ethereum has used a single-dimensional gas system where various types of computational efforts—such as executing commands, storing data, and handling complex cryptographic proofs—are cumulatively priced under one umbrella of “gas cost.”



The Problem with Single-Dimensional Gas



Buterin points out that this single-dimensional approach has a significant drawback: it oversimplifies how different resources are consumed on the Ethereum network. For instance, storing data might have a different impact on the network compared to executing a transaction. Treating these diverse activities as equivalent in terms of resource consumption can lead to inefficiencies and potential security risks. For example, if the network underestimates the resources needed for a transaction type, it could either reject safe transactions or accept potentially harmful ones.



Introducing Multidimensional Gas Pricing







            
            

            
            

            
            

        

To tackle this, Buterin proposes a system where gas is no longer a single entity but split into multiple dimensions—each representing a specific type of resource usage. This approach, already partly implemented in Ethereum’s EIP-4844 upgrade, allows for more accurate and fair pricing of the varied demands placed on Ethereum’s infrastructure.



Practical Applications and Implications



One practical manifestation of this idea is the introduction of “blobs” for rollups (layer 2 scaling solutions that help Ethereum scale by handling transactions off the main chain). These blobs are priced separately from regular transaction gas and have their limits, making rollup transactions significantly cheaper and more efficient. The differentiation in pricing helps in managing network demands more effectively without compromising the throughput.



What This Means for Ethereum Users



For everyday users and developers, this change means that transactions could become cheaper and the network more robust against spam and attacks. Developers, in particular, might need to rethink how they design their applications to optimize for the different types of gas costs.



The Future of Ethereum’s Gas System



Looking ahead, Buterin envisions expanding this multidimensional approach to other areas of Ethereum’s operation, such as storage. This could involve setting separate limits and prices for different types of data storage, potentially increasing the overall efficiency and security of the network.

Binance fires investigator for exposing market manipulation with DWF Labs â WSJ - Crypto Briefing




Binance has reportedly fired a member of its market-surveillance team who uncovered evidence of market manipulation by DWF Labs, one of the exchange’s high-profile clients.According to a Wall Street Journal report, the dismissed employee and his colleagues had identified instances of pump-and-dump schemes and wash trading by “VIP” clients, including DWF Labs.The market-surveillance team, which was hired to identify signs of market manipulation and other illicit activities as part of Binance’s efforts to improve its compliance practices, found that “VIP” clients – those trading more than $100 million per month – were engaging in activities prohibited by Binance’s terms and conditions.DWF Labs, a prolific investor in crypto projects that emerged in early 2023, was reportedly making over $4 billion in monthly trades on the exchange.Binance has denied the claims, stating that it rejected allegations of permitting market manipulation and that the employee was dismissed after an inquiry found the accusations against the client were not “fully substantiated.”“Binance emphatically rejects any assertion that its market surveillance program has permitted market manipulation on our platform,” a spokesperson from the exchange said.DWF Labs also responded to the article, claiming that the allegations were “unfounded and distort the facts.”“It has come to our attention that a recent article contains many allegations that we believe to be unfounded and that do not accurately represent our ethical business practices,” DWF Labs said in an announcement through its Telegram channel.The investigators submitted a report alleging that DWF Labs had manipulated the prices of several tokens through $300 million worth of wash trades in 2023. However, Binance determined that there was insufficient evidence of market abuse, the WSJ report states.A specific token linked to Web3 gaming, YGG, was named alongside six other tokens. YGG is a token launched by Yield Guild Games, a Web3 firm which has key leadership from the Philippines, where Binance is currently banned.A recent statement from Binance further said that it was “unaware” of the documents, arguing that if these allegations were “very concerning” if proven to be true. The exchange’s founder, Changpeng Zhao, has been sentenced to four months in prison after the exchange was embroiled in a series of legal battles.

Lawyer Questions Claims That Ripple’s ODL Agreement Satisfies The Howey Test


							

Bill Morgan has questioned the claim that Ripple’s ODL agreement satisfies the Howey Test.



Morgan asked how and where the expectation of profit arose from the contract.



According to Morgan, the reviewed agreement did not involve a transfer of title in XRP or a sale.




Renowned crypto lawyer Bill Morgan has questioned the claim that Ripple’s ODL agreement satisfies the Howey Test. In a recent post on X, the prominent crypto personality shared his findings from the 2020 ODL contract between Ripple and an Australian ODL customer. After his review, Morgan asked how and where the expectation of profit arose from the contract.







Following his review, Morgan highlighted some of the features he discovered in the contract. He noted that the contract involved XRP transfer into the purchaser’s agreed account with Bitstamp or another account and held on bailment, which the customer will hold as a bailee. The crypto lawyer emphasized the transaction was a transfer and not a transfer of title in the XRP or a sale,  describing it as “Committed XRP.”



Morgan also noted that the transaction becomes a sale once the ODL customer withdraws XRP from the bailment account. He explained that the withdrawal is converted into a  USD purchase price at a market rate managed by an automated software system. Hence, upon withdrawal of the XRP, the ODL customer is deemed to have purchased XRP from the Ripple company at the market rate.









According to Morgan, the contract terms constrain the ODL customer from purchasing the Committed XRP for investment purposes or with an expectation of profit. The customer shall only use the Committed XRP for an ODL transaction on an exchange or through a party approved for ODL.  



Morgan further noted that breaching the agreement term, which Ripple has the right to monitor, can result in the termination of the agreement and the return to Ripple of all unpurchased XRP in the bailment account.

Ripple to Use Its Upcoming Stablecoin AND XRP in Cross-Border Payment Product, Says Senior Exec | Cryptoglobe


                                
Last month, at Paris Blockchain Week 2024 (April 9-11, 2024), Web3 journalist Ornella Hernández talked to Markus Infanger, Senior Vice President of RippleX. His discussion focused on the growing ecosystem, new technological advancements, and Ripple’s role in facilitating blockchain innovation.



The XRP Ledger booth attracted significant attention at the conference, serving as a hub for queries and discussions about blockchain development. Infanger noted the enthusiastic reception from attendees, many of whom were eager to learn about starting projects on the XRP Ledger. This interest highlights the ledger’s expanding influence and the community’s eagerness to explore its capabilities.



Ripple is actively fostering an environment conducive to innovation. Infanger detailed the resources available to developers, including grant programs, accelerators, and learning portals. These initiatives are designed to support developers at various stages of their projects, from inception to implementation, ensuring they have the tools needed to succeed.



During his chat with Hernández, Infanger highlighted several projects currently leveraging the XRP Ledger, such as Palisade, Sologenic, and Phi Wallet. These projects exemplify the ledger’s utility in promoting financial inclusion and advancing the tokenization of assets. By supporting these initiatives, RippleX is not only advancing its technological base but also contributing to the broader blockchain ecosystem.



Infanger provided updates on the latest enhancements to the XRP Ledger, including the introduction of an automated market maker and a new decentralized identifier (DID) standard. These developments are part of Ripple’s ongoing efforts to enhance the ledger’s functionality and scalability. The automated market maker is designed to improve liquidity and trading efficiency, while the new DID standard aims to provide more robust identity solutions within the blockchain space.







            
            

            
            

            
            

        

Ripple’s commitment to community development is evident in its educational efforts. Infanger emphasized the importance of the learning portal and other resources that help new developers navigate the complexities of blockchain technology. By democratizing access to comprehensive educational materials, Ripple ensures that newcomers can effectively contribute to and grow within the XRP Ledger ecosystem.



Even more interestingly, the Ripple executive discussed Ripple’s upcoming stablecoin project. The planned stablecoin is envisioned as a key development for Ripple, aiming to bridge the gap between traditional finance and cryptocurrencies. Markus projected significant growth for the stablecoin market and expressed enthusiasm about Ripple’s ability to meet developer demands and facilitate more financial activities on-chain with a compliance-first approach.



Ripple plans to leverage its stablecoin in existing real-world cross-border payment products alongside XRP, enhancing scalability and offering new options for financial transactions. Additionally, the stablecoin will support projects involving real-world assets on the XRP Ledger, indicating Ripple’s strategic focus on broadening the ledger’s utility across global financial operation



Markus touched on the crucial role stablecoins play in developing regions like Latin America and Africa, where they counteract local currency instability and high inflation rates. Ripple’s stablecoin aims to provide solutions that are globally applicable, reinforcing its potential to impact a wide range of financial operations worldwide

SEC Chair Warns ‘Many’ Crypto Assets Are Securities, Says Investors Are Not Getting Required Disclosures - The Daily Hodl


								U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) Chair Gary Gensler thinks American crypto investors aren’t receiving enough information about most digital assets.
The SEC recently sent out a Wells Notice to Robinhood’s crypto arm, alerting the retail trading giant that it’s planning to pursue legal action against them.










In a recent interview with CNBC, Gensler says he can’t speak on specific companies but views a significant portion of the crypto sector as non-compliant with securities laws.
“The field of crypto assets, without prejudging any one of them, many of those tokens are securities under the law of the land as interpreted by the U.S. Supreme Court. So we follow that law, and you, the investors, are not getting the required or needed disclosures about those assets.”
Robinhood chief executive Vlad Tenev took to X earlier this week to decry the SEC’s planned action against Robinhood Crypto.
“Over the last three years, we’ve reached a state of regulatory onslaught that is harmful to American companies and consumers.
The SEC’s continued attack on crypto, coupled with recent rule proposals like the one related to predictive data analytics, mark yet another improper attempt by the administrative state to stifle innovation.”
In his new interview, Gensler also avoided answering a question about whether Ethereum (ETH) is a commodity or a security and instead spoke about the sector in broad terms.
“To me, the fundamental question is, ‘How do we ensure the American investor is protected?’ And right now, they’re not getting their required or needed disclosures, and the intermediaries in the center of this rather centralized market generally are conflicted in doing things we would never allow the New York Stock Exchange to do. The New York Stock Exchange is not allowed to trade against the investors.”

JPMorgan Analysts Optimistic About Future Approval Of Spot Ether ETFs Despite Regulatory Hurdles - Robinhood Markets (NASDAQ:HOOD) - Benzinga

In light of recent regulatory actions, JPMorgan analysts remain confident that the SEC's scrutiny of Robinhood HOOD Crypto will not impede the approval of spot Ethereum ETFs.What Happened: This perspective comes even as the retail brokerage faces potential enforcement from the SEC for its dealings in what are alleged to be unregistered securities, The Block reported.Earlier this week, Robinhood announced that it had received a Wells notice from the SEC, which suggests impending enforcement actions related to its cryptocurrency operations. Robinhood Crypto allows trading in a variety of cryptocurrencies, including Bitcoin and Ether, among others. According to Nikolaos Panigirtzoglou and his team at JPMorgan, this development reflects ongoing efforts by the SEC to assert that most cryptocurrencies, with the possible exceptions of Bitcoin and Ether, should be regulated as securities.“In our opinion, it does not look like the Wells notice should pose an obstacle to an eventual approval by the SEC of spot Ethereum ETFs, although perhaps not as soon as this month,” stated Panigirtzoglou. He further noted that similar to prior approvals for Bitcoin BTC/USD related financial products, the path for Ethereum might follow a similar trajectory, potentially involving legal challenges if initial SEC approvals are denied.Also Read: ‘Who Do I Sue?’ JPMorgan Exec Sees Public Blockchains As Inadequate For Large TransactionsRegarding the specific implications of the Wells notice on Ethereum ETH/USD, Panigirtzoglou clarified, “No, we don’t think it is implied by the Wells notice to Robinhood. Robinhood does not only facilitate trading on Bitcoin and Ethereum but also on 13 further tokens.Eventually, the status of Ethereum is likely to be determined by legislation and as we argued previously (and as it was revealed in Hinman’s papers last June) there might be an eventually ‘middle’ category for Ethereum, neither commodity nor security but something in between.”The market’s reaction to potential delays in the approval of a spot Ether ETF seems muted, as evidenced by the ongoing discount in the net asset value of the Grayscale Ethereum Trust.The analysts believe that the market has tempered its expectations for immediate regulatory approvals.In a strategic shift, Grayscale withdrew its application for an ether futures ETF, which according to Panigirtzoglou, might indicate a preference to focus on converting its existing Ethereum trust into a spot ETF. This move is seen as part of a broader strategy to align with potential regulatory outcomes, with key decisions expected by May 23.What’s Next: As the digital asset sector continues to evolve, the implications of these regulatory developments will be a key topic at Benzinga’s Future of Digital Assets event on Nov. 19.This event will offer critical insights into how companies and investors can navigate the complex regulatory landscape, and what the future holds for mainstream cryptocurrency products such as Ethereum ETFs.Read Next: Bitcoin ETF Issuer VanEck Launches ‘MEMECOIN’ Index, Includes DOGE, SHIB And 4 More Meme CoinsImage: Shutterstock

Why is Celsius (CEL) Rising Post-Bankruptcy? 94% of Tokens Sent to Burn Address | Cryptopolitan

Celsius (CEL) decreased its supply by 94% at the end of April, sending 94% of outstanding tokens to a burn address. The token burn surprised the markets, rallying from $0.14 to $0.96 after the burn was finally noticed. The past week was marked by a series of CEL rallies, reaching a peak at $0.98.Celsius destroyed 94% of its supply in a single transaction as part of its bankruptcy procedure. In the past year, Celsius divested most of its assets, returning loan collaterals and shrinking its crypto lending ecosystem. Celsius took back the tokens from its whole ecosystem on October 12, 2023, and held them until the burn transaction.Why Did Celsius Burn Tokens?This is not the first token burn for Celsius. The platform started burns in October 2021, close to the peak of the bull market. The main goal was to decrease supply and make CEL more valuable. After the bankruptcy, Celsius still controlled 652.2M tokens, which it could burn. The token was not needed, since it was not tied to lending and was not used for rewards. The decision to burn was part of the bankruptcy settlement and involved only tokens that Celsius controlled directly. The burn apparently did not affect the ability to trade or use all remaining tokens.Why is CEL Rising: Irrational Trading, Risky ShortingThe rise of CEL is entirely irrational, as Celsius has not announced a renewal of the project. The most probable reason is that CEL is now turning into a meme token and new buyers are just trying to see how high it can trade. More than 78% of CEL activity is concentrated on OKX and Gate.IO, the last two exchanges to keep some of the token balance. After restructuring, only a few entities own actual CEL tokens and only those two exchanges have pairings with USDT and are capable of providing some liquidity. Even decentralized markets have completely abandoned CEL. Celsius Has No Control Over Remaining TokensWhat is more curious is that the CEL token contract itself is interacting with addresses. Transactions are coming in from OKX and Gate.IO wallets, while small batches of tokens are sent to Uniswap V3 to trade the CEL/WETH liquidity pair. Celsius has not announced a return to operations. However, in the months after the bankruptcy, CEL acquired small listings on Bilaxy exchange and other markets. Those listings are not related to Celsius, and may represent only pure risk-taking by traders.The Ethereum token contract shows the new supply is just above 40M tokens, so CEL is now treated as a brand new scarce asset. CEL is also closely watched by traders for opportunities to short, in case the price reverts to the baseline.CEL is also not rising by itself. In the past week, the practically useless token FTX (FTT) also went through another vertical rally. FTT had short-term rallies as high as $5, then went vertical in the past week before crashing again. FTT slid from a short-term peak above $2.20 to its current level of $1.52.

President Biden to veto regulated crypto custody legislation


In a recent statement from the Executive Office of the United States President Joe Biden, the President’s Administration announced that he would veto legislation enabling highly regulated financial firms to act as custodians for cryptocurrencies.
Specifically, the Administration of the incumbent US President voiced its strong opposition to the passage of House Joint Resolution (H.J. Res.) 109, adding that President Biden would veto it if he were to see it, according to the document from May 8.
Biden’s opposition to the legislation. Source: The White House
Opposing arguments
Indeed, listing the reasons for the President’s opposition to this legislation, the statement said that it would interfere with the work of the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and invalidate the regulations that the Administration deemed more valuable:



“[It] would disrupt the [SEC’s] work to protect investors in crypto-asset markets and to safeguard the broader financial system [and] would invalidate SEC Staff Accounting Bulletin 121 (SAB 121), which reflects considered SEC staff views regarding the accounting obligations of certain firms that safeguard crypto-assets.”

On top of that, the Administration said that the SAB 121 was a “response to demonstrated technological, legal, and regulatory risks that have caused substantial losses to consumers,” as well as adding that such legislation if adopted, could threaten financial stability:

“By virtue of invoking the Congressional Review Act, it could also inappropriately constrain the SEC’s ability to ensure appropriate guardrails and address future issues related to crypto-assets, including financial stability. Limiting the SEC’s ability to maintain a comprehensive and effective financial regulatory framework for crypto-assets would introduce substantial financial instability and market uncertainty.”

Rival’s crypto-friendly stance
Meanwhile, such opposition to crypto-friendly laws has earned the current US President (more) criticism, including from his rival in the presidential race and former US President, Donald Trump, who recently mocked Biden for, as he believes, not understanding the crypto industry.
At the same time, Trump contrasted Joe Biden’s crypto views to his own, according to which he was “fine with it,” whereas the Democratic Party and the SEC was “very much against it,”  as he told his supporters at an exclusive dinner at his Mar-a-Lago resort in Palm Beach, Florida.

Another Country Is Introducing Strict Rules on Cryptocurrency Regulations to Prevent Money Laundering! - Bitcoin Sistemi


New measures targeting cryptocurrency service providers have been adopted in Taiwan, aiming to strengthen anti-money laundering (AML) efforts and combat illicit financial activities.
Taiwan Enforces Stricter Regulations on Cryptocurrency Services by Enforcing Anti-Money Laundering Measures
According to a recent report by ABMEDIA, failure to comply with these regulations can have serious consequences, including imprisonment for up to two years.


Under newly enacted regulations, any cryptocurrency service provider operating within Taiwan's jurisdiction must complete anti-money laundering registration.
Failure to comply with this requirement not only exposes providers to legal liability but also threatens the integrity of the financial system by potentially facilitating illegal transactions.






Additionally, people who are found to be using virtual asset accounts for money laundering purposes will be subject to strict penalties under the new regulations.
ABMEDIA's report highlights the Taiwanese government's determination to crack down on financial crimes associated with cryptocurrencies, highlighting that offenders could face prison sentences of six months to five years.


The implementation of these stringent measures underscores Taiwan's proactive approach to regulating the burgeoning cryptocurrency industry.
By implementing strong AML requirements, authorities are trying to reduce the risks posed by digital assets and ensure compliance with international standards aimed at combating financial crimes.

Understanding Staking & Its Importance In The Crypto Space



Cryptocurrency staking is a process where users participate in transaction validation on a blockchain network by locking up their coins. This helps secure the network and maintain its operations. Staking involves holding funds in a cryptocurrency wallet to support the network’s functionalities, such as achieving consensus and validating transactions.



What Is Staking In The Crypto World?



In the crypto world, staking plays a vital role in maintaining blockchain networks by incentivizing users to hold their coins and participate in network activities. By staking their cryptocurrency, users contribute to the security and efficiency of the network while earning rewards in the form of additional coins. This process is a way for investors to actively engage with the projects they support and earn passive income through their holdings.




The Benefits Of Staking For Crypto Investors



Staking offers several benefits to crypto investors, including the opportunity to earn rewards on their holdings without actively trading. By staking their coins, investors can secure the network, reduce supply volatility, and participate in governance decisions. Staking also provides a way to contribute to the decentralization of blockchain networks and support their long-term sustainability. Additionally, staking can offer higher returns compared to traditional savings accounts, making it an attractive option for those looking to grow their cryptocurrency holdings.

Additionally, consider storing partially staked Polygon offline in a hardware wallet for added security.



Potential Risks Involved In Staking Polygon 



While staking Polygon can be lucrative, it is essential to be aware of the potential risks involved. One significant risk is smart contract vulnerabilities that could lead to fund loss. Hackers may target staking pools or platforms, exploiting weaknesses to compromise users’ funds.

Bitcoin Whales Lose Interest, Is This A Precursor For A Crash To $50,000?


                            Movement and accumulation from crypto whales are two of the catalysts for Bitcoin price increases. Although major whales are still buying the dip, on-chain data indicates a general waning accumulation momentum which suggests their conviction might actually be waning. 
According to IntoTheBlock, an on-chain analytics firm, Bitcoin whale accumulation volumes have declined substantially in each buying cycle over the past month. This decline in whale accumulation could be worrying for investors, especially as the price of Bitcoin is now trying to hold above $60,000.
Whale Appetite For Bitcoin Dips According To On-Chain Data
Whales, or large investors holding over 1,000 BTC, have accumulated strongly since the beginning of the year, especially during market dips. This accumulation has largely helped to keep Bitcoin in bullish sentiment and prevented huge price declines. However, IntoTheBlock recently revealed an interesting pattern between these whale wallets in each accumulation phase. 

The largest accumulation occurred between March 5 and March 7, when these wallets acquired over 120,000 BTC. Every succeeding price dip has, however, seen less accumulation than the one before it. Particularly, Bitcoin’s recent dip to $56,000 failed to attract notable whale accumulation. This drop in buying and selling activity indicates whales may have lost some interest or appetite for accumulating more Bitcoin in the short term.

Precursor For A Crash To $50,000?
The waning conviction among Bitcoin whales has raised the question of whether Bitcoin could reverse back into a full bearish momentum. These concerns are particularly valid, considering some analysts are of the notion that Bitcoin might’ve reached its peak in this cycle. 
As IntoTheBlock noted, prices have increased shortly following every accumulation this year. While the lower whale buying activity could stall price increases in the short term, it is not a sure sign that Bitcoin is headed for a major price crash. However, if the trend continues for several more months, it could signal lower demand and a weakening bull market.

According to the “In/Out Of Money Metric”, there is still a strong resistance volume between $59,000 and $61,000. A drop below this range again would push 552,220 addresses into losses. In fact, while a drop to his level would be painful for many holders, most crypto analysts remain optimistic about Bitcoin’s long-term prospects. 
At the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading at $61,488. The crypto recently rebounded around $57,500 and is up by 7.4% in the past seven days. According to analyst Marco Johanning, $57,000 is an important support level for Bitcoin. He noted that while a break below $57,000 could lead to further declines into $52,000, the crypto market is still very bullish for Bitcoin.

Will the $2B Token Release Result in a Bear Market?


							

The next two months are expected to witness a massive $2 billion token unlock of various altcoins.



10x Research warns that the token release will result in an impending bear market.



The platform asserts that the token unlock will limit the breadth and duration of the prevailing bull market.




A prominent crypto analytics platform, 10x Research, recently warned against an impending bear market driven by the $2 billion token unlocks in the upcoming days. The platform asserted that the current bull market is likely to stay shorter and unlikely to culminate in a broad altcoin rally.







Reportedly, the crypto market is expected to witness a massive unlock of various altcoins in the next two months. For instance, tokens like Aptos (APT), Starkware (STRK), and Arbitrum (ARB) are set to unleash $97 million, $79 million, and $94 million tokens, respectively. In addition, Immutable X releases $53 million IMX tokens while Avalanche and Optimism are set to unlock $330 million AVAX and $64 million OP, respectively.



Tokens like SUI, ENA, ALT, and XAI are also poised to see large unlock events, with Sui releasing $1 billion tokens, Ethena $48 million, ALT $171 million, and XAI $135 million. Reflecting on the potential impact of the events, 10x Research stated, “Rapid succession of nearly $2 billion of token unlocks during the next ten weeks could lower the market for altcoins.”



Further, the analysts spotted “significant constraints” in the industry’s growth potential despite remarkable developments and the high trading volumes of more than $100 billion. Forecasting the potential challenges the market is poised to face, the platform stated that the prevailing bull run will have a limited “breadth and duration.”









In a K33 Research article, analyst Vetle Lunde hinted at the distribution of $11 billion Bitcoin (BTC) to the Gemini Earn program and Mt.Gox creditors. He posited, “The next months are rigged to see waves of good old crypto FUD.”

                        Rwanda is studying the feasibility of adopting a central bank digital currency (CBDC), exploring benefits, risks and practicalities of implementing a retail CBDC.The National Bank of Rwanda (BNR) released a feasibility report on Wednesday, assessing possible opportunities for a CBDC in Rwanda. The central bank is adopting latest innovative technologies, and the CBDC is curated to local norms and conditions.“The feasibility study finds that there are opportunities for improvements in the payments landscape of Rwanda,” the report read. “The identified Sweet Spots are well-positioned to address these opportunities.”The bank pointed to four “sweet spots” for CBDC “based on stronger evidence and higher certainty of achievability than the other opportunities.”This includes increasing resilience against power or network outages, improving innovation and competition among other rival CBDCs, contributing to achieving a cashless economy and developing faster, cheaper and transparent international remittances.BNR also laid out challenges involved in introducing a CBDC in the Central African nation. “The risks that the study identifies with a high level of concern and few mitigation options are related to CBDC adoption by the public, financial service providers, and merchants.”
Risk of Low CBDC Adoption
Rwanda bank stressed on clearly explaining and articulating CBDC in a simple manner to Rwandans. It also noted that the risk of CBDC adoption is a “complex mater,” which has to be addressed.“CBDC should provide a frictionless user experience by combining the best of both private and public currency worlds,” it added. “Alternatively, the CBDC user experience could mimic mobile money. This requires careful balancing, since the BNR should not be seen as a competitor to EMIs.”Further, to address these issues, the central bank of Rwanda recommended a token-based CBDC model with open programmability. It also proposed an offline-capable CBDC. It would use Bluetooth or Near Field Communication (NFC) “that are not reliant on Internet connectivity.”

Is Ethereum Targeted by the SEC? Will ETFs Be Approved? JP Morgan Hopeful! - Bitcoin Sistemi

While the SEC continues to increase its pressure on the cryptocurrency industry, its latest target was the US-based cryptocurrency platform Robinhood.
At this point it was revealed that the SEC sent a Wells Notice to Robinhood in early May.


While discussing the possible effects of the SEC's Wells Notice sent to Robinhood on the cryptocurrency industry, the latest assessment came from JP Morgan.
SEC Will Have to Approve Ethereum ETFs!
The SEC's Wells Notice to Robinhood Crypto is unlikely to block final approval of spot Ethereum ETFs, JP Morgan analysts said, The Block reported.





JP Morgan analysts led by Nikolaos Panigirtzoglou said that the SEC will eventually make a decision on ETH, but that the SEC will not classify ETH as a security or commodity but in another 'intermediate' category.
Analysts also noted that it would not be a huge disappointment for the markets if the SEC rejected Ethereum ETFs in May, and the markets were not expecting approval this month anyway.



“In our view, the Wells notice does not appear to preclude the eventual approval of the spot Ethereum ETF by the SEC.
ETFs may not be approved as soon as May, however. If the SEC refuses to approve spot Ethereum ETFs, it will likely face litigation and eventually lose and be forced to approve.”

SEC Wells Notice Didn't Directly Say Ethereum Is a Security!
JP Morgan analysts said the SEC did not explicitly state, nor imply, that Ethereum was not a security in its Wells Notice to Robinhood.
At this point, analysts pointed out that Robinhood offers trading services for 13 altcoins other than Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum and said:






“We do not believe that the SEC's notice to Robinhood implied that ETH was a security.
Because Robinhood not only facilitates trading on Bitcoin and Ethereum, but also 13 other tokens.
Ultimately, we think Ethereum's status will likely be determined by legislation and the court. “We think there could ultimately be a 'middle' category for Ethereum, neither a commodity nor a security, but something in between.”

Euclid launches layer to connect liquidity across Cosmos, Solana, and EVM chains - Crypto Briefing




Euclid Protocol has announced today its shared liquidity layer that connects Cosmos, Solana, and Ethereum Virtual Machine-based ecosystems, powered by virtual pools created on Nibiru Chain. This effort is aimed at consolidating fragmented liquidity across the blockchain ecosystem.“We are excited to finally reveal the Unified Liquidity Layer, Euclid’s answer to the constantly growing challenge of fragmented liquidity,” said Georges Chouchani, founder and CEO of Euclid. “Euclid lays the groundwork for the next era of DeFi, aiming to provide users with a chain-agnostic modular experience. Its primary goals include ensuring scalability and fostering an efficient market environment.”The announcement points out the fragmented liquidity experienced by the decentralized finance (DeFi) ecosystem. Despite showing nearly $136 billion in total value locked (TVL), these funds are scattered across DeFi.Euclid’s Virtual Liquidity Pool (VLP) model addresses this by virtually unifying liquidity without the need to physically move it, maintaining modularity and accessibility. The VLP allows for tracking and seamless movement of liquidity across all integrated chains.Moreover, those pools are created using Nibiru Chain as a Virtual Settlement Layer (Nibiru), creating a single source-of-truth ledger. This ledger connects all integrated blockchains, offering low slippage and fair pricing ecosystem-wide through the LiquiSync model, a framework that enables any chain or protocol to connect permissionlessly.“Euclid’s modular, accessible, and unified liquidity layer, powered by Nibiru Chain, is transforming the zero-sum nature of DeFi into a positive-sum game,” said Unique Divine, Co-Founder and CEO of Nibiru Chain. “This environment allows projects to synergize and scale together rather than just compete. Such synergy fosters collective advancements and competitive edges that could surpass those of established DeFi giants.”The reveal follows a successful $600,000 pre-seed funding round led by Kahuna Network and angel investor Tomoaki Sato, with additional support from associated angels of Lavender Five, Andromeda, and Nibiru Chain.Last month, Euclid also secured a grant and liquidity backing to prime its pools for future use. These funds are earmarked for the development of the project’s architecture, business development, audits, and marketing efforts.Euclid’s roadmap includes extending its liquidity layer to encompass both EVM and non-EVM chains, leveraging protocols like IBC, CCTP, Axelar, and its own messaging protocol. The framework will be supported by EUCL, the native governance revenue share token, allowing holders to stake, receive protocol fees, participate in governance, and utilize the protocol’s treasury.

VanEck Meme Coin Index With DOGE And SHIB Would 'Outperform 99% Of People If You Left It Alone,' Says Trader - Benzinga

VanEck’s meme coin index made a splash in the crypto community, prompting traders to point to the growing mainstream adoption of meme coins.What Happened: Market Vector announced the launch of its MarketVector Meme Coin Index with the symbol MEMECOIN, covering the six largest meme coins. It is compiled of Dogecoin DOGE/USD, Shiba Inu SHIB/USD and Pepe PEPE/USD with 30.8%, 28.3% and 14.5%, respectively. Dogwifhat, WIF/USD, Floki Inu FLOKI/USD and Bonk BONK/USD make up the remaining three index components with 12.5%, 7.1%, and 6.7%, respectively. The component weightings are capped at 30%.The index's single-day change is down 2.7% but up 186% year-over-year. The market capitalization of the index stands at $44.7 billion. Although the index’s launch date is April 22, 2024, its next review date is cited as May 27, 2024.The index's performance since inception (Oct 31, 2021) is -23.3%, but its year-to-date performance is +138%.Also Read: Only Dogecoin And Shiba Inu Have Crossed The $10B Meme Coin Mark: ‘Who Will Be The Third?,’ Muses Crypto WhaleWhy It Matters: Pseudonymous trader apatheticwhale tweeted that the "emergence of the Vaneck Meme Coin index means that this is literally just the beginning."Another trader stated that with the launch of the index "we are going much higher." Heavily followed trader Plazma noted that although Pepe is only one-sixth of Dogecoin's market capitalization, its weight in the index is half of that of Dogecoin.Cold Blooded Shiller sees the meme coin index as a way to “outperform 99% of people.”Pepe and Dogwifhat are the newest entrants to the $2 billion valuation club, launched in April 2023 and December 2023, respectively.  While Floki and Bonk are also very close to the $2 billion mark, both tokens mimic the meme coin leader Shiba Inu in burning tokens and increasing demand.Another trader tweeted that "We may be in a bull market, but the bull run hasn't begun yet. The god candles are upon us, and the memes will run." He sees meme coins  "exploding" after a bottom for altcoins in summer.What’s Next: The influence of Bitcoin as an institutional asset class is expected to be thoroughly explored at Benzinga’s upcoming Future of Digital Assets event on Nov. 19.

Dogecoin is showing signs of a bullish trend, according to recent on-chain metrics and market indicators.First, the summary gauge in the metrics snapshot points to "Mostly Bullish" sentiment on IntoTheBlock's main page, with four indicators in the neutral zone and two indicating bullish trends. This overall sentiment is supported by specific on-chain and exchange signals that reflect the underlying strength and market dynamics of Dogecoin.Net network growth: Sitting in the neutral zone with a slight increase of 0.14%, this metric indicates that the number of new addresses joining the network is stable. This stability is crucial for maintaining network health and potential growth.Dogecoin/USDT Chart by TradingViewIn the money: Another neutral signal is at 0.49%, suggesting that a significant portion of addresses are at or near profitability, which can influence holding patterns among investors.Concentration: The minimal concentration change of 0.03% reflects a decentralized spread of DOGE holdings, reducing the risk of price manipulation by large holders.Large transactions: A slight decrease of -3.91% in large transactions could suggest less immediate institutional or whale activity, aligning with more stable, organic market movements.Bid-ask volume imbalance: At 0.57% bullish, this suggests a slight dominance of buy orders over sell orders, which can be a precursor to a price increase if the trend continues.The trading chart for Dogecoin further validates these indicators. Currently, DOGE is seeing support around the $0.1444 level, with a resistance near $0.1600. The price movement within this range alongside a gentle uptick in trading volume points to sustained interest and potential for upward movement.Overall, the on-chain situation for Dogecoin is slightly tilted in favor of bulls. However, we might see a drastic change of the situation in the foreseeable future if the market sees a wave of new liquidity.

Hong Kong Businessman and Son Implicated in Cryptocurrency Investor Abduction


							

Hong Kong businessman and son surrender for investor abduction.



Cryptocurrency investor allegedly owed millions, abducted.



Police hunt for four captors involved in cryptocurrency abduction.




A Hong Kong businessman and his son were arrested in the investigation of a cryptocurrency investor’s abduction. The pair, aged 70 and 30 respectively, surrendered to police on Wednesday afternoon at Tai Po Police Station, accompanied by their lawyer.



While not directly involved in the physical abduction, the businessman and his son were arrested on suspicion of false imprisonment and assault. Authorities revealed a connection between the suspects and the abduction after discovering the getaway vehicle belonged to the family.



According to an inside source, the businessman allegedly invested a significant sum, HK$15 million (US$1.9 million), in virtual currency through the victim 18 months prior. The source further claimed the businessman faced difficulties retrieving his investment and the victim became increasingly unreachable at times.









Reportedly, the 55-year-old female investor was forcefully dragged from her car in Tai Lau Leng Village by four unidentified captors and shoved into a seven-seater vehicle. Her 43-year-old husband attempted to intervene but was sided with a stun gun. Both the victim and her husband sustained injuries during the ordeal and were treated at a nearby hospital.



As of Thursday evening, a search for the four captors remains ongoing. Police suspect they may have been hired for the abduction and there is a possibility that there might have been a lack of direct connection between the businessman and the physical act. This incident marks the second abduction in Hong Kong within a mere 32-hour window, raising concerns about a potential rise in such crimes.

Why is ThorChain Trending: The Platform Aims to Grow TVL for More Liquid DeFi | Cryptopolitan

ThorChain (RUNE) is extending its one-week rally, trading above $6.06 after a few days of gradual growth. The asset defied the overall stagnant market mood, recovering from weekly lows of $4.80. So far, RUNE has managed to regain some of the losses during the early April correction. The coin is yet to move back to the $7.50 range. However, the latest price move broke an important resistance, setting expectations for RUNE to move higher. The latest price moves may boost attention for RUNE, as the asset awaits a breakout to double-digit levels. In short-term predictions, RUNE is seen climbing toward $12. Price setbacks also show a trend to buy the dip and wait for the breakout.RUNE is a relatively new asset with an all-time high at only $20. During the current bull market, RUNE only recovered to $10, but hopes remain that the asset is undervalued and may go even above its previous record.Why ThorChain Recovering Faster than the MarketThorChain is keen on active community outreach, and has a growing presence on social media. To compare, ThorChain has grown to around 10% of Solana’s social media influence, based on CryptoCompare statistics.This exposure is enough, so that network updates get a response from social media and from markets. Recently, ThorChain updated its node software to optimise gas usage and fees. The latest upgrade extended the RUNE price rally, while other major assets continued trading sideways. The project is also self-monitoring for activities, and marked a successful week after the upgrade. ThorChain aims to maximize its usage for cross-chain swaps, liquidity pools and overall decentralization.Most of the ThorChain activity comes from Trust Wallet, which aggregates all use cases from NFT to DEX trades. ThorChain also added new users in April, although at a slightly slower pace compared to the previous months.ThorChain Offers Learn-to-Earn ProgramThorChain was in the spotlight for its newly launched learning program with incentives. Affiliated projects of ThorChain and the Maya Ecosystem will provide the rewards for an educational series on blockchain technology and Web3 use cases. Users can earn RUNE tokens and other assets like CACAO for completing tasks and missions. ThorChain aims to grow its outreach, after offering various tiers of engagement, from developer tools to node incentives. Despite the activity, ThorChain has only four large commits to its codebase in the past 12 months, leaving it behind some of the more active projects. ThorChain also relies on external services to monitor the health of its network. ThorChain aims to build a highly decentralized blockchain, while ensuring speed to grow its DeFi applications. ThorChain Returns to Decentralized LendingThorChain had a revival of DeFi in Q1, where total assets expanded above $500M. Currently, ThorChain carries more than $380M worth of assets and is trying to recover decentralized finance. ThorChain itself serves as a native DEX, and now aims to boost its liquidity for a renewed crypto lending program. Lends_so is using the infrastructure of ThorChain to offer low-cost lending and passive returns, while secured by high-value collaterals. ThorChain has positioned itself as a decentralized hub for trading major blue-chip assets. The expectation of another DeFi summer may benefit ThorChain, which is already carrying several liquidity pools based on major coins and tokens.One of the potential problems for ThorChain is the scarcity of wallets that carry the asset. RUNE runs on a native blockchain, which has around 105K addresses in 2024. Trust Wallet is one of the key resources for ThorChain to communicate with the wider decentralized ecosystem. For now, ThorChain achieves around $1B in monthly swap volumes, relying on organic growth. ThorChain interacts with a small selection of platforms and chains, the most prominent among them Bitcoin, Ethereum, Litecoin, BNBCoin and Avalanche.

Should We Expect Bitcoin to Replace Gold as Store of Value? | Coinspeaker



The difference between Bitcoin and traditional commodities is that it provides holders with both the benefits digital currencies offer and the advantages of conventional assets.

Over the years, people have often converted traditional money to gold and other types of commodities to deal with inflation. In recent years, many have turned to digital assets as stores of value because they feel more confident about investing in innovative commodities.
Stores of value are defined as asset classes that maintain their value in the long run but are more volatile than fiat money. Traditional currencies are the best solution for daily transactions and work as mediums of preserving value in the short term, but they fail to retain value in the long run. Fiat money tends to lose value fast in periods of high inflation, which can lead to monetary systems breaking down.




More investors have become interested in countering the effects of inflation and have identified assets like gold, real estate, bonds, stocks, and blockchain-based commodities as the ideal mediums for the purpose. It’s wise to choose an asset that could appreciate in value over time. Stores of value are superior to traditional currencies and go through boom-and-bust phases. It’s essential to note that market conditions influence all of them; hence, their values are interrelated.
Seasoned investors know that they must add assets immune to market fluctuations to protect their wealth. Gold has been popular in the market for maintaining its high value regardless of the world’s economic and political issues. Gold has maintained its worth over the years and has gained the reputation of functioning as a hedge against challenging times. It stood the test of time as a store of value because people have considered it a convertible, mobile, rare, and durable asset. Even if several monetary systems broke over the years, gold stood the test of time.
Investors love gold because it’s a predictable asset, consistent in price fluctuations, and has a limited supply. It also lacks a correlation to other stores of value like real estate and equities. Institutional investors and governments also recognize its value as a store of value, and some countries even adopted it as a standard monetary system. They use their gold supply to guarantee the paper money in circulation.
Let’s Further Discuss Stores of Value
You have probably heard the phrase store of value multiple times, and if you’re looking for ways to protect your finances, you might have become more interested in the idea. Different investors give different meanings to stores of value, but they usually agree that they are assets that maintain their value regardless of the fluctuations of the other assets.
Bitcoin has been growing towards the status of store of value despite going through bear markets and being subjected to price volatility. Why did this happen? Experts believe that the fact that it lives on a decentralized network infuses it with trustworthiness. While some investors argue against Bitcoin’s store of value status, most state without hesitation that its volatility should be expected, considering its speculative nature. If you want to learn more about its value trajectory you can check the Bitcoin price prediction online.
To determine if Bitcoin could be listed among stores of value, it’s wise first to explore the features such a commodity has:

The public must confide in the reliability of the asset. No asset can achieve the store of value status if the public refuses to use it. Therefore, an asset will be listed among stores of value when individuals and organizations accept it and include it in investment portfolios.
Stores of value should maintain their value over the years because investors are looking for durability, aside from trustworthiness.
All stores of value have a limited supply, being one of the characteristics that enable them to increase in value as they become scarcer. However, its supply should be extensive because if it’s too scarce, its price would be exorbitant, allowing investors to purchase it. Only a small number of people or organizations would afford to invest in a too-scarce asset, and therefore, it wouldn’t be able to work as a store of value for the public. Stores of value should be averagely easily exchangeable.
Stores of value are transferable and divisible so people can exchange their property and purchase or sell smaller portions. People want to make use of the value of their assets. Hence, it’s paramount for a store of value to be transferable and divisible.
All units of a store of value should have identical values and characteristics.

Why do Bitcoin Supporters List It among Stores of Value?
Bitcoin is the first currency based on blockchain technology; therefore, it is scarce, available worldwide, and has a decentralized nature. It’s no wonder that it has become one of the most attractive solutions for investors looking for alternatives to traditional commodities. However, considering that it’s still a cryptocurrency, it has a high volatility, making it challenging to predict its exact value.
In this context, it’s essential to have a look at the features that could position it in the series of stores of value.

It boasts durability. It’s a digital currency, protecting it from any physical wear and tear. It will exist as long as blockchain exists.
It’s a portable asset because it exists digitally, so holders can take it with them when they travel. Gold, for example, is quite expensive to transport, so investors prefer digital gold when they plan to change their location often.
Bitcoin is a divisible asset because it can be split into smaller units. Each Bitcoin can be divided into 1/100,000,000th satoshi. Also, each bitcoin can be exchanged for another, as they are identical, so the cryptocurrency is also fungible.
It’s a scarce commodity because Satoshi Nakamoto designed it to have only a 21 million coins supply.

Last Words
As mentioned earlier, many investors consider Bitcoin digital gold, so they often use it as a store of value. The difference between Bitcoin and traditional commodities is that it provides holders with both the benefits digital currencies offer and the advantages of conventional assets. Will Bitcoin become the best store of value? Only time could tell.

How Bitcoin mining can help with environmental cleanup | Cryptopolitan

Recent findings challenge the once prevalent belief that Bitcoin mining primarily harms the environment. Dennis Porter, CEO of Satoshi Action Fund, emphasized on Twitter the potential of Bitcoin mining as a transformative tool for environmental betterment, particularly in methane management. This change in narrative emerges from a comprehensive study co-authored by experts like Murray A. Rudd, Matthew Jones, Daniel Sechrest, and Daniel Batten.Bitcoin – Transforming Waste into WorthThe research demonstrates the dual benefit of Bitcoin mining: environmental cleanup and economic value creation. Particularly notable is the potential of Bitcoin mining to convert vented methane—a potent greenhouse gas—into electricity.By tapping into just 1% of the U.S. Bitcoin mining network to utilize vented methane, it could mitigate methane emissions equivalent to 9 billion miles driven by gasoline-powered vehicles. This method not only addresses critical methane emissions but also repurposes them as a valuable energy source, shifting Bitcoin mining from an ecological burden to an asset.The study delved into the specifics, revealing that a mere 1.14 megawatts (MW) of Bitcoin mining could reduce 2,187 metric tons of methane annually. This is comparable to the environmental impact of removing over 156 million miles driven by gas vehicles from our roads each year. If scaled, the implications are monumental, positioning Bitcoin mining as a significant player in global sustainability efforts.Economic and Environmental SynergyBy implementing landfill methane capture with Bitcoin mining, the strategy leverages financial incentives to foster environmental sustainability. This innovative approach not only combats methane emissions but also promotes a financially viable model for energy generation. The study underscores the viability of integrating Bitcoin mining with landfill gas to energy projects, evaluating through a Monte Carlo simulation the economic impacts of such a merger.This model is particularly important given the high costs and energy consumption associated with traditional Bitcoin mining. By utilizing methane from landfills, Bitcoin mining operations can transform a harmful waste product into a clean, profitable energy source. The study highlighted the use of modern, energy-efficient mining rigs which can enhance profitability while reducing environmental impact.The involvement of Nodal Power, a pioneering landfill Bitcoin miner, and their patented technology was pivotal. Their innovations in methane mitigation have set a new standard in the field, demonstrating the practical benefits of combining high-tech solutions with environmental conservation strategies.The study was a collaborative effort, with masive contributions from former Greenpeace activist Daniel Batten and Dr. Murray Rudd, whose expertise helped model the transformative effects of this approach. Their work suggests that this innovative integration could extend beyond landfills to other sectors like agriculture and wastewater treatment, proposing a versatile model for methane reduction.However, the path to widespread adoption of this model is filled with challenges. The volatile nature of Bitcoin prices, fluctuating electricity costs, and diverse regulations are major obstacles. The study calls for strategic navigation of these issues to maximize the benefits of this integration.Despite these challenges, the research presents a compelling case for the role of Bitcoin mining in environmental strategies. By converting a potent greenhouse gas into digital gold, Bitcoin redefines the global economic state of energy use.

                        SHIB has dropped by 1.5% today, with the Shiba Inu price landing on $0.00002242 as the crypto market suffers a 1% loss in the past 24 hours.The meme token remains up by a very modest 1.5% in a week, although it has also witnessed 10% fall in a fortnight and a 20% decline in a month.However, it’s not all bad news today, with VanEck subsidiary MarketVector launching a meme coin fund yesterday.Such a fund could potentially boost SHIB’s price over time, especially when the coin is the second-biggest component of the fund, after Dogecoin.
Shiba Inu Price Prediction as New York-based VanEck’s Subsidiary Launches Meme Coin Fund – Will SHIB Skyrocket?
It’s clear that SHIB is in the middle of a slump, yet its recent history suggests that it will enjoy a rebound quite soon.Its 30-day average (orange) fell below the 200-day (blue) a couple of days ago, and is now quite low, suggesting that the market is overselling it.Source: TradingViewLikewise, the coin’s relative strength index (purple) has remained below 50 since Monday, also suggesting that the time is ripe for an uplift.Yet it’s worth pointing out that SHIB’s support level (green) has lowered in recent days, implying that the coin is too weak to prevent further losses in the near term.However, the negative outlook may be about to change, with this week seeing the aforementioned news that MarketVector – a subsidiary of major New York-based institution VanEck – has opened its own meme token fund.As the tweet above shows, SHIB comprises 28.34% of the overall fund, ahead of PEPE but slightly behind Dogecoin.This index launch could mean that we will see higher volumes for SHIB over the coming weeks and months, helping its price to pick up.More generally, its oversold status at the moment would also point to incoming recoveries, while expected rate cuts will bring market-wide positivity in later months.And what helps SHIB more than its rivals is that it has some of the strongest fundamentals of any meme token, given its recent efforts to expand its ecosystem and utility.Most recently, developers announced that it would soon be launching a privacy-focused layer-three network, for which it raised $12 million in funding last month.As such, things still look very good for the coin, with the Shiba Inu price likely to reach $0.00004 by the end of summer.
Newer Meme Tokens Bring More PotentialWhile the new VanEck fund could help instigate a meme token season sooner or later, SHIB won’t be the only coin to benefit from increased demand.There are also a wide variety of new meme coins in the market, with some of these holding real potential.At the top of any list of promising new tokens is Dogeverse (DOGEVERSE), a multi-chain crypto that has raised over $13 million in its ongoing presale.Launching on Ethereum, DOGEVERSE will also bridge to Polygon, BNB Chain, Solana, Avalanche and Base, making it crypto’s first multi-chain Doge-themed cryptocurrency.This is bullish insofar as the ability to use the coin on multiple networks will increase its use and adoption, with DOGEVERSE potentially gaining traction on numerous dApps.One other thing it has over the original Dogecoin is that it has a fixed supply of 120 million tokens, making it potentially deflationary over time.By squeezing supply, DOGEVERSE’s price is likely to rise higher than it may have otherwise, a process likely to be amplified by the ability to stake the token.VIDEOIn theory, the token’s existence on multiple chains could make for more holders than usual staking the coin, something which will magnify the coin’s chances even further.Investors can participate in its sale by visiting the official Dogeverse website, where 1 DOGEVERSE costs $0.00031.This is its final presale price, meaning that it may rise much higher once it lists on exchanges in the next few weeks.Buy DOGEVERSE Today

Taiwan brings tough penalties for crypto non-compliance | Cryptopolitan

Taiwan is cracking down hard on cryptocurrency service providers who sidestep regulations. The latest legislative sweep introduces severe penalties, signaling a zero-tolerance policy against non-compliance in the crypto sector. With stringent new rules in place, Taiwan aims to fortify its financial sector against money laundering and fraud.Registration or RetributionAt the forefront of Taiwan’s regulatory overhaul is the requirement for all virtual asset service providers to complete money laundering prevention registration. Failure to comply could lead a company’s executives to face up to two years in prison.This mandate is part of a broader legislative initiative, the “New Four Laws to Combat Fraud,” which encompasses the Fraud Crime Harm Prevention Regulations, the Money Laundering Prevention Law, the Technology Investigation and Security Law, and the Communications Security and Supervision Law. Together, these laws enhance the government’s toolkit to tackle and prevent a spectrum of criminal activities, sharpening the focus on crypto transactions.The revisions specifically target loopholes previously exploited in the crypto market. A major update is the categorization of new, special money laundering crimes. For instance, using virtual asset accounts and third-party payment accounts as conduits for laundering activities now carries a potential prison sentence ranging from six months to five years. Additionally, offenders could be slapped with fines up to NT$50 million.A Tighter Leash on Currency DealersAnother critical aspect of the regulatory update is the tightened scrutiny over both domestic and foreign currency dealers. Under the revised Money Laundering Prevention Law, it’s not just the local currency dealers who are required to register for anti-money laundering (AML) purposes. Foreign currency dealers eager to operate within Taiwan must now establish branches or complete proper company registration locally. This step is seen as a move to ensure greater transparency and legal compliance in the virtual asset transactions conducted within and across Taiwan’s borders.Qiu Shuzhen, the deputy chairman of the Financial Supervisory Commission, highlights the Commission’s role as a stringent overseer in this evolving sector. The focus is not only on the rigorous inspection of currency dealers’ investment and payment flows but also on fortifying their internal management and control systems. Integration of accountants into these processes aims to boost transparency and adherence to the law.To date, 25 virtual currency exchanges have stepped up, aligning with legal standards and completing compliance statements pertinent to money laundering prevention. This indicates a growing industry acknowledgment of the serious repercussions of non-compliance under Taiwan’s tightening legal framework.Through the implementation of these robust laws, Taiwan’s government shows its determination against financial crime and its commitment to secure the financial market. The expectation is that as these laws are progressively enforced, they will effectively deter money laundering and fraud, thus providing a safer, more stable market environment for legitimate virtual asset operations.

Roblox Corporation (RBLX) Stock Plunges After Firm Downgrades Guidance for Q2 and Full Year 2024 - Tokenist


					
Neither the author, Tim Fries, nor this website, The Tokenist, provide financial advice. Please consult our website policy prior to making financial decisions.



Roblox Corporation (NYSE: RBLX) recently unveiled its financial and operational results for the first quarter of 2024. The company’s financial health appears robust, with significant year-over-year increases in net cash and cash equivalents provided by operating activities and record-setting free cash flow. However, the firm reduced its guidance for the upcoming quarter and full year.



Roblox’s revenue surged to $801.3 million, a 22% increase from the previous year. Bookings, a critical metric for Roblox that encompasses revenue plus changes in deferred revenue and other adjustments, rose to $923.8 million, up 19% year-over-year.



Despite these positive trends, the company reported a consolidated net loss of $271.9 million. However, it’s noteworthy that the average daily active users (DAUs) increased by 17% to 77.7 million, and hours engaged on the platform grew by 15% to 16.7 billion, indicating a strong and engaged user base.



Roblox’s Q1 Performance



Roblox’s financial performance in the first quarter of 2024 has shown growth in revenue and bookings and operational efficiency. The company’s adjusted EBITDA was reported at $(6.9) million after accounting for increases in deferred revenue and deferred cost of revenue. Although negative, this figure is part of Roblox’s strategic approach to investing in growth and expansion. The net liquidity stood at $2.5 billion, showcasing the company’s solid financial position.



Roblox’s efforts to drive user engagement and monetization, such as experimenting with AI-driven discovery algorithms and reintroducing platform-wide events, have begun to yield positive results, according to CEO David Baszucki. Additionally, CFO Michael Guthrie highlighted the company’s operational efficiency improvements, including a nearly 50% reduction in capital expenditures compared to the previous year, contributing to the record operating and free cash flow.



When comparing Roblox’s first quarter performance against market expectations, the company’s results present a mixed picture. Analysts had forecasted an EPS of -$0.53 and revenue of $929.67 million for the quarter.



Roblox’s reported revenue of $801.3 million fell short of expectations, despite showing strong year-over-year growth. The net loss per share of $0.43, however, outperformed the anticipated EPS, suggesting a better-than-expected control over costs or potentially higher operational efficiency than analysts had predicted.





Roblox Lowers Guidance for Q2 and Full Year 2024



Looking ahead, Roblox has provided guidance for the second quarter and updated its full-year outlook for 2024. For the upcoming quarter, the company expects revenue to be between $855 million and $880 million and bookings to range from $870 million to $900 million. The anticipated consolidated net loss is between $(267) million and $(265) million, with adjusted EBITDA projected to be between $36 million and $38 million. For the full year, Roblox estimates revenue to be between $3,450 million and $3,525 million and bookings between $4,000 million and $4,100 million. The updated guidance also accounts for changes in the estimated average lifetime of a payer, reflecting Roblox’s adaptive strategies in response to its dynamic business environment.

                        Morse code, cryptic messages, and a redesign of NEAR Protocol’s X profile have left users concerned that they have been hacked.On May 8th, NEAR Protocol’s official X handle began to post a series of cryptic tweets and messages which left the crypto community puzzled. The unusual behavior started with a 28-second-long video containing a Morse code message.Once decoded, the message read, “Darkness is coming.”Two hours after the tweet, NEAR’s X account sent out four consecutive tweets using hard-to-read gothic fonts, commonly used by heavy metal bands.The tweets contained more concerning messages like “the sun rises in the east,” “take back your thoughts,” “darkness” and “reclaim your sovereignty.”This culminated in a complete visual redesign of NEAR’s X profile. Their banner and profile picture were changed to solid black.Additionally, NEAR’s display name and description were also changed to match the mysterious theme of the tweets, simply reading “dark.”
The Community’s Reaction to NEAR Protocol’s Activity
The posts are not on-brand compared to NEAR’s past communications. Something that has prompted the crypto community on X and blockchain investigators to suspect a possible hijack.However, a handful of the protocol’s supporters see the tweets as a sign of something bigger coming to the ecosystem. Though the post’s intended meaning is unclear, users generally agree to proceed with caution. This stems from the fear that a hack was launched with malicious intent.In January 2024, the X account of Cryptocurrency data aggregator CoinGecko experienced a security breach and was used to run phishing scams.The company managed to regain control of its social media account following a quick intervention. Hacks like this make it increasingly important that users are vigilant and know how to protect themselves from crypto fraud and scams.
NEAR Foundation Layoffs
NEAR Foundation, the developer of NEAR Protocol, recently laid off 40% of its staff to “significantly consolidate the core Foundation team to focus on a narrower and higher-impact set of activities.”This decision led to a loss of over 35 employees across the business development, marketing, and community teams. The company commented:
“The Foundation is well-placed to continue to support the ongoing growth, development, and further decentralization of the NEAR Protocol and ecosystem.”
The layoffs followed a review that revealed inefficiencies in the foundation’s operations.Over the next few years, the foundation intends to reduce its footprint even more as the ecosystem moves closer to true decentralization. However, this decision may have come at a cost. Some of the affected departments had direct involvement in NEAR Protocols X communications, which could have contributed to the suspected hijack of the account.

Taiwan proposes tougher AML measures for crypto service providers

Taiwan has amended its Anti-Money Laundering (AML) regulations to combat fraud and enhance Anti-Money Laundering (AML) measures for virtual asset service providers. Taiwan’s Ministry of Justice has proposed amendments to the existing AML laws that could impose up to two-year jail terms for non-compliant firms and fines of up to $1.5 million. The proposed amendments will be sent to Taiwan’s national parliament for review.The law was proposed by Taiwan’s Executive yuan called the “New Four Laws to Combat Fraud.” The amendments aim to strengthen the crackdown on fraud and strictly regulate money laundering prevention measures for crypto service providers.The four critical components of the amended regulations include the fraud crime harm prevention regulations, the money laundering prevention law, the technology investigation and security law, and the communications security and supervision law. The most notable change comes from the new money laundering prevention law that targets virtual asset service providers. VASPs that violate the law will face harsher penalties for noncompliance. Three distinct modifications have been made to this law, requiring revised registration requirements and restrictions for domestic and international currency dealers. Under the newly amended laws, Virtual asset service providers risk prison time of up to two years if they offer their services without registering with the due authority. A new legal category has been introduced for money laundering offenses linked to third-party payment accounts and virtual asset accounts. Related: Taiwan will review global trends before deciding on crypto ETFsThe penalties for utilizing third-party accounts for money laundering could lead to jail terms of six months to five years and fines of up to 50 million Taiwanese dollars ($1.5 million).Taiwan’s deputy minister of justice, Huang Mou-hsin, said under the current provisions, the authorities can only penalize noncompliant cryptocurrency companies administratively, However, the new proposed law criminalizes such behavior with hefty fines and prison time. The proposed law would make foreign cryptocurrency platforms risk criminal penalties unless they establish local firms and seek AML registration.The latest proposal comes within a couple of months after the country’s securities regulator said they would propose new laws for digital assets by September of this year.

                        Thanks to a recent partnership, developers can build non-custodial, on-chain Web3 games and products as Telegram Mini Apps (TMAs).Inco, developers of a universal confidentiality layer for Ethereum and other networks, has announced its partnership with Privy, an embedded wallet provider that enables crypto app developers to onboard their users easily.Developers can now access users directly in Telegram, a mega-popular social media platform with 900 million users worldwide.Therefore, building decentralized apps (Dapps) as TMAs allows developers to “create a consumer-friendly experience and tap into the largest pool of retail users,” the press release said.These web apps run inside Telegram Messenger, meaning that users can access them in individual or group chats.More specifically, users can launch “an embedded web interface with an experience similar to other popular in-app browsers,” the team said.Launching a TMA is as simple as starting a chat conversation with an app’s Telegram handle,” it added.As an example, the team gave a poker game running fully on-chain. Players don’t have to trust the ‘dealer.’ Instead, they can check their play thanks to the encryption technology called Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE).Source: Inco, PrivyNotably, Inco has already created “a number of demo apps,” it said. These include Slot Machine (@inco_slots_demo_bot) and Hangman (@IncoHangmanGameBot).Both of these games utilize FHE for on-chain confidentiality and randomness.
New Forms of Web3 Games on Telegram
Inco is a confidentiality-focused Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) powered by FHE, the team said.Developers can use it to build decentralized apps and mini-games that work with their wallet providers.The various game types include slot machines, card games, guessing games, prediction markets, and more.This enables “new forms of gameplay with confidential elements,” it added.Furthermore, while many TMAs provide their own custodial wallets, which is a security risk, “developers can now integrate Privy SDK to provision self-custodial wallets for users to securely power on-chain experiences from Telegram.”Additionally, developers are free to access Inco’s open-source repo to start building similar experiences within Telegram.Explaining this further, the team said that Telegram Mini Apps can be built using popular web development standards like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript / React.Building a Web3 product as a Telegram Mini App provides several advantages, including:

Automation with Telegram bots – automated text-based prompts for users, to facilitate in-app actions and receive notifications
Embedded monetization – TMAs offer monetization opportunities through in-app purchases, subscriptions, etc.;
Cross-platform experiences – developers can synchronize session history across web and mobile app deployments (e.g. starting an activity in a TMA and continuing on the desktop web).

Per Privy COO Max Segall, this partnership will help developers meet their users where they are – many of them being on Telegram.Inco CEO Remi Gai commented that “building decentralized apps directly within Telegram will become the next trend.” What’s more, it will boost the Web3 industry development.“Easy-to-access, share, and scalable apps represent a new wave of dapps,” Gai added.

DWF Labs Responds to $300M Wash Trading Allegations - DailyCoin


        
DWF Labs has denied grave allegations leveled against it.



The report with the allegations cited insider sources.



An exchange mentioned in the allegations has also responded.
Crypto trading and market-making firm DWF Labs has responded to numerous allegations leveled against it in a Thursday report, including that it engaged in hundreds of millions of wash trading on Binance last year.On May 9, the Wall Street Journal alleged that Binance’s surveillance team recommended the removal of DWF Labs and other hundred users from the exchange, citing multiple violations of the terms of use and “rampant market manipulation.”$300M “Wash Trading” on BinanceNotably, in late 2023, the surveillance team claimed that DWF Labs had manipulated the price of the YGG token and “at least six other cryptocurrencies” and processed over $300 million of wash trades on Binance that year.
Per the report, instead of removing DWF Labs from its platform as recommended by the surveillance team, Binance launched an investigation into the monitoring team itself and refuted its evidence and findings.The report alleged that Binance then fired the head of the surveillance team and rejected the recommendation to remove DWF Labs from its platform a week later. While the report claimed this information came from insiders at the exchange, implying it could be reliable, DWF Labs thought otherwise.DWF Labs’ ResponseIn a statement titled “The Real Origin Story,” DWF labs took a jab at the WSJ’s report, noting that its allegations were “unfounded.”
“To our valued partners: We want to clarify that many recent allegations reported in the press are unfounded and distort the facts.” DWF Labs said. “Establishments and fake media will not root the movement that Bitcoin started in 2009. We are in crypto for the very reasons why the establishments want to get rid of us.”On its part, Binance said its “strict market surveillance program” does not tolerate market abuse.Read why Binance CEO wants Nigeria to release the exchange’s compliance officer:Binance CEO Urges Nigeria to Release Tigran GambaryanStay updated on why the Binance Nigeria case was delayed:Binance Nigeria Case Delayed Again as Procedural Errors Pile Up

Wells Notice Wallop: Robinhood Bleeds 164 Million Dogecoin


                            The Shiba Inu’s reign as king of memecoins may be facing a ruff patch. Dogecoin (DOGE) prices dipped this week after news broke of the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) issuing a Wells Notice to Robinhood, a popular crypto exchange.
The notice, a precursor to potential enforcement action, alleges Robinhood violated multiple securities laws. This sent shockwaves through the crypto community, with many investors, particularly those holding large amounts of DOGE (often nicknamed “whales”), pulling their funds out of Robinhood.

The most significant outflow involved a whopping 164 million DOGE, worth roughly $25 million at the time, being transferred out of the exchange. This mass withdrawal by a whale investor likely contributed to the market jitters surrounding DOGE.

DOGE Price Wobbles: Short-Term Blues Or Long-Term Woof?
The price of DOGE tumbled 5.8% in the 24 hours following the Robinhood news. However, analysts caution against a knee-jerk reaction. While the legal troubles undoubtedly cast a shadow on Robinhood, the DOGE outflow, including the 164 million transfer, might not be the sole culprit behind the price dip.
Transferring cryptocurrency from an exchange to a personal wallet is often seen as a bullish move, indicating an intention to hold for the long term.
Dogecoin And Bitcoin: A Tale Of Two Blockchains
Another factor influencing DOGE’s price is its tight correlation with Bitcoin (BTC). Both currencies operate on the Proof of Work (PoW) consensus mechanism, which some see as outdated compared to newer, energy-efficient models.
The recent pullback in the broader crypto market, especially in Bitcoin, likely played a role in dragging DOGE down as well.

DOGE market cap currently at $20.7 billion. Chart: TradingView.com
Rocky Road To $0.20? DOGE Faces Support Hurdle
DOGE enthusiasts were eyeing a price target of $0.20, but the recent drop presents a roadblock. The memecoin dipped below the crucial $0.15 support level, raising concerns about a further decline.
Analysts point to a potential support zone between $0.143 and $0.146, but a fall below that could trigger a more significant price correction.
Bullish Signs Amidst The Dip
Despite the short-term pessimism, there are glimmers of hope for DOGE. The buy orders for DOGE currently outweigh sell orders by a significant margin, suggesting continued investor interest.

Additionally, the memecoin’s Relative Strength Index (RSI) sits at a neutral 47, indicating there’s room for new buyers to enter the market. Furthermore, DOGE managed to maintain a weekly price increase despite the daily drop, hinting at underlying resilience.
Doge Day Delayed, But Not Doomed
The coming weeks will be crucial for Dogecoin. The outcome of Robinhood’s legal battle with the SEC and DOGE’s ability to regain lost ground will determine its short-term trajectory. However, long-term forecasts for the memecoin remain cautiously optimistic.

                        Crypto lender Ledn revealed loans statistics for the first quarter on Thursday, surpassing all previous quarters since its inception in 2018.The lender said it facilitated over $690m in loans, with a split of $584m going to institutional clients and $106m to retail investors. Notably, over $40m of the retail loans were refinanced from crypto lender Celsius following its collapse.Ledn’s Q1 loan volume more than tripled from the previous quarter. In Q4, the company processed just $125.7m in institutional loans and $14.6m in retail loans. Ledn credits this surge to the recent approval of Spot Bitcoin ETFs in the US, which fueled a rally in Bitcoin’s price.“These developments allowed Ledn to process several hundred million in institutional loans to ETF market makers,” the company said.
Q1 Sets Stage for Promising Year as Crypto Lending Revives
Following Celsius’s bankruptcy, Ledn launched a refinancing program and said it garnered confidence from the crypto community. This resulted in Ledn securing $40m in refinanced loans, exceeding half of the total refinanced amount.“The first quarter of 2024 has set the tone for a promising year for Ledn, as we’ve not only doubled our loan book since November 2022 but have also solidified our leading position in the market by adapting to the increasing demand for digital asset financial products,” Ledn CEO Adam Reeds said in a statement.Ledn’s successful Q1 isn’t an isolated case. The broader crypto lending market is experiencing a resurgence. Coinbase’s Q4 2023 shareholder letter revealed a similar trend, with the exchange actively lending $399m to customers during that period.
Ledn Predicts Broader Crypto ETFs
Responding to strong client, Ledn rolled out Ethereum-backed loans in February. These ETH loans mirror the lender’s Bitcoin (BTC) loans, offering a starting loan-to-value ratio of 50% and an annual interest rate starting at 10.4% (12.4% APR).Mauricio Di Bartolomeo, Ledn’s co-founder and Chief Strategy Officer, told Cryptonews that the loan processing experience on the platform is straightforward. “You do not need to learn how to interact with protocols to access a Ledn ETH-backed loan,” he said.He also predicted that crypto ETFs will soon encompass a broader array of crypto assets within a single investment vehicle.

Solana Slerf (SOLSLERF), a Solana memecoin that was launched this week, is aiming to challenge other memecoin giants, such as Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE).




Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Solana Slerf presents a similar opportunity.



Solana Slerf has market cap below $10,000 at the moment, meaning that when it just reaches a modest market cap of $200,000-$500,000, early investors would generate returns of 2,000%-5,000% in a matter of days or hours.



The exciting memecoin is poised to rally 9,000% in the coming two days, and Solana Slerf could potentially reach a multi-million dollar market cap within a few weeks.




Currently, Solana Slerf can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jupiter and Raydium, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days.



To buy Solana Slerf on these platforms, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Solana Slerf by entering its contract address – D2R7sKwPNpWGtEfMJiLVe5G2ZJbExnk98PEft2dhyCrL – in the receiving field.



In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price.



If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner.




The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum.



This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like SOLSLERF.

Bitcoin Facing These 'Compelling Mid-Term Bearish Cases,' Warns Trader - Benzinga

While maintaining a bullish stance on Bitcoin’s BTC/USD long-term prospects, crypto trader Altcoin Sherpa has shared his thoughts on some compelling mid-term bearish cases.What Happened: Sherpa points out several factors suggesting a potentially bearish scenario for Bitcoin in the mid-term.
Presence of a rounded top formation in the price action, typically associated with a more "toppy" market.



Current consolidation period length: previous run-ups did not exhibit similar price action for such an extended duration without a significant pullback.



The overall market structure in 2020 was significantly different, and the current market is trending rather than ranging.



Even if Bitcoin drops to the $40,000-$50,000 range, it could lead to a violent move that could "rekt the market" and cause altcoins to lose 50% or more of their current value.
He maintains that this would not signal the end of the current cycle and that Bitcoin could still reach six figures and experience a mania phase, possibly in Q4 2024, after a period of consolidation.Also Read: If Bitcoin Starts ‘Losing The Lows’ It Could Get ‘Ugly’ And ‘Violent,’ Traders WarnWhy It Matters: Sherpa suggests that this type of price action could lead to larger downtrends or pullbacks, even if Bitcoin remains bullish on higher time frames. While he believes that predicting price action so far is not sensible, it is a good idea to think about it and plan for it.The trader’s emphasis on the unique characteristics of each market cycle serves as a reminder that historical price action may not always be a reliable indicator of future performance.Factors such as ETF inflows, improving macro conditions, and the upcoming U.S. elections could all contribute to a "different" market dynamic this time around. At a recent NFT event, Donald Trump stated that people can donate to his campaign using crypto.What’s Next: The influence of Bitcoin as an institutional asset class is expected to be thoroughly explored at Benzinga’s upcoming Future of Digital Assets event on Nov. 19. To know how meme coins have evolved in the past few years, this could be a relevant read.

MarketVector has launched a Meme Coin Index that might make a massive difference for future rallies on the meme coin market. This index comprises popular meme coins like Dogecoin, Shiba Inu, Pepe, dogwifhat, Floki Inu and BONK.The significance of this index lies in its performance and broader implications for the market. With a staggering return of 137.96% so far this year, the Meme Coin Index has outperformed other indices on the MarketVector platform. This exceptional yield highlights the growing interest and speculative investment in meme coins which, despite their origins as internet jokes, have garnered substantial market capitalization and investor interest. Dogecoin and Shiba Inu, two of the most prominent assets in the index, have shown mixed performance in the last few weeks. Dogecoin, however, has seen a resurgence in interest, reflected in its on-chain metrics.The performance of these coins underscores the potential of meme assets to yield high returns. This could pave the way for products similar to ETFs but for cryptocurrencies, focusing specifically on meme coins. Such products would not only diversify investment options but also legitimize meme coins as more than just internet lore — they could be considered serious investment opportunities due to their performance and the offered risk-exposure.The launch of the Meme Coin Index could also signify a shift in how financial products are being tailored to the new age of investors. These are individuals who are tech-savvy, drawn to memes and looking for unconventional investment avenues with potentially high returns. As more assets similar to this index become tradable, they could offer a new kind of value proposition to investors who are willing to engage with the high-risk, high-reward nature of the market.

Ether turns inflationary for the first time since Merge

The Ether (ETH) supply has ceased to be deflationary following Ethereum’s highly anticipated Dencun upgrade that went live two months ago.Total Ether supply increased to 120.1 million on May 7, from 120 million on March 12, before the Dencun upgrade was rolled out on mainnet, according to CryptoQuant data.While this is a small increase, it marks the first period when Ether supply turned inflationary since September 2022, when the much-anticipated Merge transitioned Ethereum to its current proof-of-stake consensus model.Ethereum: Total Supply and Fees Burned. Source: CryptoQuantEther temporarily losing its deflationary status is not critical for the Ethereum network since its main benefits are more related to decentralized applications (DApps), according the founder and CEO of Cryptoquant. In a May 9 X post, Ki Young Ju wrote: “Post-Dencun upgrade, $ETH lost deflationary status with reduced fees, departing from “ultrasound money.” Ethereum’s strength lies in DApps; it’s wiser not to compare it to Bitcoin’s sound money narrative.”Ethereum Total Transactions and Fees Burned. Source: Ki Young JuEther supply first turned deflationary after the Merge on Sept. 15, 2022, when a mechanism that permanently burned transaction fees on the network was introduced resulting in a decreasing Ether supply. Over 419,713 Ether tokens were burned, or permanently removed from circulation, since the Merge, according to ultrasound.money.Source: ultrasound.moneyRelated: Dencun is a big step towards mass adoption: Metis CEOThe death of “ultra sound” money?The Dencun upgrade has ended Ether’s inflationary streak by making median transaction fees as much as four times cheaper than before, with the same level of network activity.While this is a significant step for the Ethereum network and its users, it could spell the end of Ether’s status as ultra-sound money, according to a May 8 report by CryptoQuant.“The Dencun upgrade has made ETH inflationary again, potentially killing the narrative of “Ultra sound” money as a structurally lower amount of transaction fees burned on Ethereum have had the corresponding effect of not decreasing the total supply of ETH to keep it deflationary.”Due to lower transaction fees, the amount of Ether being burned has declined to its lowest levels since the Merge, while supply growth has risen to its highest level since the upgrade.Related: VanEck subsidiary’s memecoin index up 137% year-to-date

Is DWF Labs Market Manipulation Being Covered By Binance, Or Is There An Important Secret? - Coincu



	

Key Points:




Allegations of DWF Labs market manipulation surface at Binance after the dismissal of an internal investigator.



Binance faces scrutiny over its handling of the situation following government management.




Former insiders of Binance have alleged that the recent dismissal of an internal investigator sheds light on the crypto exchange’s alleged negligence regarding evidence of DWF Labs market manipulation.





Allegations of DWF Labs Market Manipulation Rock Binance



The accusations surfaced after claims that Binance fired an employee who raised concerns about potential market manipulation activities.



Reports from the Wall Street Journal indicate that between 2022 and 2023, Binance had assembled a team of investigators to probe into market manipulation suspicions on the exchange. 



The investigation revealed that DWF Labs, a prominent investment fund and market maker specializing in Web3 projects, was allegedly manipulating the prices of YGG tokens and several other cryptocurrencies. Additionally, DWF Labs was accused of engaging in “wash trading,” with trading volumes exceeding $300 million and the sale of nearly 5 million tokens during market recoveries.




Binance co-founder He Yi responded to these allegations, asserting the exchange’s stringent monitoring of market makers and its commitment to report any irregularities to regulatory authorities. However, DWF Labs refuted these claims as baseless, while Binance maintained its confidence in the integrity of its investigation team.



Binance Faces Controversy Over Handling of Market Manipulation Allegations



In response to the investigation’s findings, Binance was urged to impose trading bans on violating users. However, Binance dismissed these claims, stating that the evidence presented by the monitoring team was insufficient to confirm DWF Labs market manipulation.



Amidst these allegations, Binance faced scrutiny over its handling of the situation, particularly regarding its dedication to ensuring a fair trading environment. 



The dismissal of the Head of the Supervisory Team further fueled speculation, with allegations of a close relationship with DWF Labs’ competitor Wintermute. Despite calls to remove DWF Labs’ trading account, Binance refused, citing concerns over the head of the monitoring team’s alleged collaboration with competitors.

Near Protocol's X Posts Raise Alarm: Is the Account Compromised?


							

Near Protocol’s cryptic X posts raise concerns of a possible account hack.



Recent staff reduction at Near Foundation suggests restructuring to focus on core activities.



Previous crypto-related account compromises fuel heightened scrutiny amid unusual Near Protocol posts.




Near Protocol’s recent cryptic X posts from its official account have sparked speculation and concern within the crypto community. The posts, which include messages like “Darkness is coming” and “reclaim your sovereignty,” have raised suspicions of a possible hack or hijack of the account. Despite this, Near Protocol has yet to provide an official confirmation.



The unusual posts began on May 8, with a 27-second Morse code video posted without context. Cointelegraph decoded the message, revealing the phrase “Darkness is coming.” This was followed by four tweets in a difficult-to-read gothic font, accompanied by a change in the account’s name and description to match the gothic theme.







While some see the X posts as a sign of impending developments within the Near ecosystem, others are concerned about the security of the protocol’s official account. This concern is not unfounded, as other crypto-related accounts, such as CoinGecko and the United States Securities and Exchange Commission, have been compromised in the past.









In January, CoinGecko’s account was used in a phishing scam before being reclaimed, while the SEC’s account was briefly compromised to post a false message about the approval of Bitcoin spot exchange-traded funds. The timing of these incidents in relation to Near Protocol’s posts has led to heightened scrutiny and speculation within the crypto community.







During the same period, Near Foundation decided to reduce its staff by 40%. The foundation, known for developing the Near Protocol layer-1 protocol, stated the need to “significantly consolidate” its team in order to focus on key activities. The decision resulted in the termination of 35 employees from the marketing, business development, and community teams. NEAR Protocol’s current price stands at $7.11, with a trading volume of $401.8 million over the past 24 hours, experiencing a 0.50% decrease during this period.

Bitcoin Miners are in Trouble! Mining Difficulty Reached Bear Market Levels! - Bitcoin Sistemi


Bitcoin, the world's leading cryptocurrency, has reached its most significant mining difficulty level in nearly 18 months, signaling a shift in the landscape of cryptocurrency mining.
Bitcoin Mining Difficulty Sees Biggest Drop in 18 Months Amid Falling Hash Rate
Today's 5.7% decline marks the highest negative situation since the bear market bottoms on December 6, 2022, when Bitcoin was trading around $17,000.


According to data from Bitbo, the difficulty adjustment occurred at a block height of 842,688 and the difficulty dropped to 83.1 trillion.
Bitcoin mining difficulty serves as a relative measure of the difficulty associated with mining new blocks, adjusting automatically every 2016 blocks to maintain an average block discovery time of 10 minutes, regardless of changes in miner activity.






The latest negative adjustment follows a significant 10% drop in network hashrate since the last adjustment on April 24.
This decline, from the seven-day moving average of 639.58 EH/s to 578.74 EH/s, contributed to average block times of 10 minutes and 36 seconds before adjustment.


The drop in hash rate also caused Bitcoin's hash price to drop to an all-time low, dropping below $50 per PH/s per day ($0.05 per TH/s per day) on April 29, with Bitcoin's price falling below $63,000. It coincided with the same time.

AI has a monopoly on power and privacy. Blockchain fixes this. - Blockworks


Many Americans got their first glimpse behind the machine learning curtain when details of Amazon’s “Just Walk Out” technology went public. Instead of pure technology tallying up customers’ purchases and charging them when they left the store, the sales were manually checked by about 1,000 real people working in India.
But these workers were the human-half of what most AI really is — a collaboration between reinforcement learning and human intelligence. 
The human element tends to be ignored in discussions of AI safety, which is a little disturbing given how much of an impact AI will likely have on our job markets and ultimately our individual lives. This is where decentralization, the inherent trustlessness and security of blockchain technology can play a major role.
The Center for Safe AI identifies four broad categories of AI risk. As a start, there’s malicious use, in which users might “intentionally harness powerful AIs to cause widespread harm” by engineering “new pandemics or [using them] for propaganda, censorship and surveillance, or [releasing AIs] to autonomously pursue harmful goals.” 
A more subtle concern is the risk of an AI race, where corporations or nation states compete to quickly build more powerful systems and take unacceptable risks in the process. Unchecked cyberwarfare is a potential outcome, another is allowing systems to evolve on their own, potentially slipping out of human control; or a more prosaic, but no less disruptive outcome, could be mass unemployment from unchecked competition. 
Organizational risks with AI are similar to any other industry. AI could cause serious industrial accidents, or powerful programs could be stolen or copied by malicious actors. Finally, there’s the risk that the AIs themselves could go rogue, “optimizing flawed objectives, drifting from their original goals, becoming power-seeking, resisting shutdown or engaging in deception.” 
Regulation and good governance can contain many of these risks. Malicious use is addressed by restricting queries and access to various features, and the court system could be used to hold developers accountable. Risks of rogue AI or and organizational issues can be mitigated by common sense and fostering a safety-conscious approach to using AI. 
But these approaches don’t address some of the second-order effects of AI. Namely, centralization and the perverse incentives remaining from legacy Web2 companies. For too long, we’ve traded our private information for access to tools. You can opt out, but it’s a pain for most users.
AI is no different than any other algorithm, in that what you get out of it is the direct result of what you put in — and there are already massive amounts of resources devoted to cleaning up and preparing data to be used for AI. A good example is OpenAI’s ChatGPT, which is trained on hundreds of billions of lines of text taken from books, blogs and communities like Reddit and Wikipedia, but also relies on people and smaller, more customized databases to fine-tune the output. 
Read more from our opinion section: What can blockchain do for AI? Not what you’ve heard.
This brings up a number of issues. Mark Cuban has recently pointed out that AI will eventually need to be trained on data that companies and individuals might not want to share, in order to become more commercially useful beyond coding and copywriting. And, as more jobs are impacted by AI — particularly as AI agents make custom AI applications accessible — the labor market as we know it could eventually implode. 
Creating a blockchain layer in a decentralized AI network could mitigate these problems. 
We can build AI that can track the provenance of data, maintain privacy and allow individuals and enterprises to charge for access to their specialized data if we use decentralized identities, validation staking, consensus and roll-up technologies like optimistic and zero-knowledge proofs. This could shift the balance away from large, opaque, centralized institutions and provide individuals and enterprises with an entirely new economic system.
On the technological front, you need a way to confirm the integrity of data, the ownership of data and its legitimacy (model auditing). 
Then, you would need a method of provenance, (to borrow a phrase from the art world), which means being able to see any piece of data’s audit trail in order to properly compensate whoever’s data is being used.
Privacy is also important — a user must be able to secure their data on their own electronics and be able to control access to their data, including being able to revoke that access. Doing so involves cryptography and a security protection certification system.
This is an advancement from the existing system, where valuable information is merely collected and sold to centralized AI companies. Instead, it enables broad participation in AI development. 
Individuals can engage in various roles, such as creating AI agents, supplying specialized data or offering intermediary services like data labeling. Others might contribute by managing infrastructure, operating nodes or providing validation services. This inclusive approach allows for a more diversified and collaborative AI ecosystem.
We could create a system that benefits everyone in the system, from the digital clerics a continent away to the shoppers whose cart contents provide them raw data to developers behind the scenes. Crypto can provide a safer, fairer, more human-centric collaboration between AI and the rest of us.

TikTok to automatically label AI-generated content

TikTok, the popular social media platform for creating and sharing short-form videos, said it will now start automatically labeling artificial intelligence (AI)-generated content (AIGC) when it is uploaded to the platform. On May 9, the social media giant said it is partnering with the Coalition for Content Provenance and Authenticity (C2PA) and will be the first media-sharing platform to implement its Content Credentials technology. TikTok has already been requiring content creators to label realistic AIGC for over a year, along with anything made with its own TikTok AI effects. However, the recent development implements auto-labeling on AI-generated content created using other platforms. It said this will be done with the Content Credentials technology which attaches metadata to content that the platform can use to instantly recognize and label AIGC.The statement said the increase in auto-labeled AIGC on TikTok will be “gradual at first” as soon as Content Credential is implemented on other platforms to metadata, it will be able to label more content. For the time being, the feature will only be available for images and videos, with the intention of bringing it to audio content in the near future.  The social media platform has also joined the Content Authenticity Initiative (CAI), led by Adobe. Dana Roa, the general counsel and chief trust officer at Adobe, said: “At a time when any digital content can be altered, it is essential to provide ways for the public to discern what is true.”Related: Biden’s Homeland Security team taps tech elite for AI defense boardIn addition to the AI labeling, TikTok said it will also be rolling out media literacy resources, which were developed alongside MediaWise and WITNESS. The social media platform intends to release 12 videos throughout the year highlighting universal media literacy skills and explaining how TikTok tools like AIGC labels can further contextualize content. This comes as AI continues to advance and has the capacity to create more realistic content, sparking a rise in AI-generated deepfakes. On May 8, authorities in Hong Kong discovered an unlicensed, fraudulent cryptocurrency exchange that faked connection with Elon Musk, posting AI-generated videos and images of Musk on its website and social media handles.A few days prior, Berkshire Hathaway co-founder Warren Buffett said the impact of AI concerning illicit financial activities is comparable to the advent of the atomic bomb and nuclear weaponry.This came after exposure to a deepfake of himself that was able to realistically mimic the way he dressed, moved and talked.Magazine: Pickup artists using AI, deep fake nudes outlawed, Rabbit R1 fail: AI Eye

MarketVector by VanEck: new index to track memecoins

MarketVector by VanEck has recently introduced an index dedicated to memecoins, which has seen a 195% increase on an annual basis. The index includes a variety of popular tokens such as Dogecoin, Shiba Inu, Pepe, Floki Inu, Dogewifhat, and BONK.
Let’s see below all the details. 

MarketVector by VanEck launches an index for memecoins
As anticipated, VanEck’s MarketVector has followed the trend of memecoins by introducing a new index dedicated to this popular category of tokens.
The Meme Coin Index by MarketVector, identified by the symbol MEMECOIN, tracks the six most important meme tokens, including Dogecoin (DOGE), Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Pepe (PEPE). Other components of the index include Dogwifhat (WIF), Floki Inu (FLOKI) and BONK.
Considering the performance of its components, the new MarketVector index has risen by over 195% on an annual basis. 
For comparison, the CoinDesk 20, which tracks the 20 largest tokens excluding stablecoins, grew by 97% in the same period, while Bitcoin (BTC) recorded an increase of 123%.
Meme coins have a total market capitalization of about 51 billion dollars, according to CoinGecko, with the MarketVector index tracking 44.67 billion dollars.
Some investment managers have recently reported that the popularity of memecoins could continue thanks to the low fees on the Solana blockchain.
Which allow users to make small bets with the potential for high earnings, unlike previous crazes limited by high fees on Ethereum.
Furthermore, a new category of meme tokens called PoliFi is emerging with the approaching election season. The market capitalization of this new category has reached 586 million dollars. 
A specific token, BODEN, has increased by 16% after former president Donald Trump mentioned it during an electoral event. At the same time, MAGA, a token inspired by Trump, has risen by 28% and TREMP has experienced a surge of 142%.
VanEck CEO: why invest in semiconductors?
According to the CEO of VanEck, Jan van Eck, investing in semiconductors could be the most effective strategy to take advantage of the artificial intelligence (AI) boom. In particular, during an interview on CNBC’s ETF Edge, he stated: 
“Semiconductors have become the heart of artificial intelligence commerce.”
The VanEck Semiconductor ETF (SMH) fund, which includes 25 of the top chip manufacturers in the United States, has grown by 21% this year. Although it experienced a 6% drop in May, dragged down by declines from giants like Intel, AMD, and Nvidia.
Van Eck argues that this weakness could be only temporary, as the increasing demand for AI chips offers potential long-lasting returns: 
“They have gone from being a highly cyclical business with short-lived products to an integral part of the growing commerce, with higher recurring revenues, so they can maintain high profits despite some short-term fluctuations.”
Mike Akins, co-founder of ETF Action, shares a similar point of view, highlighting that limited competition among major chip producers could support the group, as explained:  
“Until competition significantly increases, it is difficult to see this sector losing momentum.”
However, Akins warns to carefully monitor the flows of funds in semiconductors as an indicator of future performance. 
It suggests that very low flows can indicate a buying opportunity, while high flows can suggest that it is time to reduce positions.

Donald Trump backed the US crypto industry in a recent Q&A.



The majority of Americans do not own digital assets, making crypto a minor voting issue.
The US crypto industry has been subjected to a multi-year pummeling under the Biden administration. Major players, including Robinhood, Coinbase, and Ripple, to name a few, have been subjected to punitive enforcement actions and regulatory crackdowns, to the point that there is no denying that a campaign against digital assets exists.Some observers, including Dave Weisberger, the CEO of CoinRoute, claim this industry assault is the product of collusion between Democrats and legacy finance, who view cryptocurrency as an existential threat. However, in a glimmer of hope for crypto supporters, presidential hopeful Donald Trump recently voiced his support for the besieged sector.Trump Wants Thriving US Crypto IndustryDuring a recent gala dinner Q&A with buyers of his “Mugshot Edition” NFT collection, Trump expressed his support for the besieged US crypto industry. When asked what he would do about firms potentially leaving the US over regulatory hostility, Trump responded, “We’ll stop it because I don’t want that.” 
During the session, the former president also took the opportunity to mock Joe Biden’s understanding of digital assets while drawing a line between both parties by distinguishing Democrats as the anti-crypto party. In contrast, Trump endorsed cryptocurrencies by saying, “I’m good with it.”Nonetheless, cryptocurrency remains a bipartisan issue, with some Democrats, like Angela Alsobrooks and Jake Auchincloss, in favor of digital assets. However, several senior Democrats, including Elizabeth Warren and Brad Sherman, have been outspoken critics, alleging cryptocurrency enables criminality.Hoskinson Pans Democrats Wading into the political arena, Input Output CEO Charles Hoskinson made clear that a Biden victory in November would be disastrous for the US crypto industry. He said:
“The intent of this administration is to destroy the American cryptocurrency industry. Understand that. It is unambiguously clear. They have obfuscated, lied, and repeatedly, throughout the years, hurt our industry.”Strengthening his case further, Hoskinson recounted past actions under the watch of the Democrats that have held back the industry, including restricting access to banking, regulation through enforcement, anti-clarity, and most recently, obstructing the legislative process regarding Biden vetoing the passing of H.J. Res. 109 by the House of Representatives.H.J. Res.109 proposed to repeal a Securities Exchange Commission (SEC) policy that prevented regulated firms from custodying crypto assets. Biden stated that repealing H.J. Res. 109 would disrupt the SEC’s “work to protect investors” and hamper the agency’s efforts to maintain an effective crypto framework.On the FlipsideWhy This MattersBy backing crypto ahead of the 2024 election, Trump is making a calculated play to court a passionate voter base. This strategy positions Trump as a business-friendly visionary willing to embrace new economic and technological frontiers. However, cryptocurrency remains a niche issue that most mainstream American voters don’t prioritize.Read about the MAGA memecoin’s rollercoaster price action:Donald Trump’s Wallet Erases $3M Deficit as MAGA Coin ResurgesP2P platform LocalMonero shuts down with no explanation given:LocalMonero Calls It Quits: Is Regulatory Pressure to Blame?

Former President Donald Trump-related memecoin lead market following new crypto promises

Former President Donald Trump continued his advances toward the crypto community by hosting an event for holders of the Trump Cards NFT Gala on May 8 at his Mar-a-Lago resort in Palm Beach, Florida.During the event, Trump expressed his support for cryptocurrencies, announcing plans to accept digital asset donations for his potential re-election campaign. He also emphasized the need for a more favorable regulatory environment for the growing crypto industry.Following the statements, a Trump-inspired MAGA memecoin lacking utility surged by over 40%. This impressive gain positioned MAGA as the top performer on CryptoSlate’s list of gainers during the reporting period.Pro-cryptoVideos circulating on social media showed Trump’s critique of the Biden administration’s approach to crypto, signaling potential shifts in policy should he return to office.Trump highlighted the exodus of crypto firms from the US due to regulatory hostility, promising a friendlier environment under his leadership to bolster the industry domestically.The former president chastised Biden’s lack of crypto understanding, attributing it to his administration’s unfavorable stance. Trump said:“Biden doesn’t know, Gensler is very much against it, the Democrats are very much against it.”Notably, Trump previously held anti-crypto sentiments during his tenure, labeling Bitcoin as a scam in 2021. However, his views of the sector appear to have evolved, as evidenced by his embrace of non-fungible tokens (NFTs) bearing his semblance.Trump is banking on this newfound view to gather support for his presidential campaign, stating that:“If you like crypto in any form, and it comes in a lot of different forms, if you are in favor of crypto, you better vote for Trump.”These moves have spurred speculation on how a potential Trump presidency could benefit crypto. Financial institution Standard Chartered suggested that a second Trump term could be a boon for Bitcoin and other digital assets by offering viable alternative investment avenues.Mentioned in this article

Insurance Giant Announces Investing in Bitcoin ETFs! - Bitcoin Sistemi


While the spot Bitcoin ETFs approved by the SEC in January attracted many new institutional investors to the market, a new ETF purchase news comes every day.
At this point, Bloomberg ETF analyst Eric Balchunas said that many investment advisors, banks and other institutional investors have invested in BTC ETFs, but they have not yet reported and disclosed these investments.



While many corporate companies have recently reported their ETF exposure in line with this determination of Balchunas, the latest statement came from the insurance giant MassMutual.
Accordingly, leading insurance company MassMutual reported exposure to the Bitcoin ETF in its 13F filings.





The investment amount of MassMutual, which bought it from the Grayscale ETF, was not disclosed.




This is not the first Bitcoin investment by the famous insurance company MassMutual. Because the company purchased a large amount of Bitcoin through New York-based Digital Investments Group (NYDIG) in 2020. MassMutual, which was founded in 1851 and has approximately 5 million customers, had invested $100 million worth of BTC.

White Pepe (WHPEPE) to Skyrocket 6,800% as MEXC Listing Announced, While Shiba Inu and Dogecoin Struggle



                    

White Pepe (WHPEPE) could turn early investors into multi-millionaires if it becomes a mainstream coin, like Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE).



White Pepe (WHPEPE), a new Solana memecoin that was launched this week, is poised to explode over 6,800% in price in the coming days.




This is because WHPEPE has announced its first centralized exchange listing, which will be on MEXC.



This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up.



Currently, White Pepe can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jupiter and Raydium, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days.




Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and White Pepe could become the next viral memecoin.



To buy White Pepe on Raydium or Jupiter ahead of the MEXC listing, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for White Pepe by entering its contract address – 58kSp6Sn8P42EdRDgud75YcvkRLnCpMxPb7MqCRHkUeG – in the receiving field.



In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price.



If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner.




The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum.



This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like WHPEPE.

Solana-based BODEN beats SHIB, PEPE, WIF: Election season impact? - AMBCrypto



BODEN and TRUMP pump significantly as the U.S. elections come closer.
Social volume for tokens such as WIF, PEPE and SHIB declined.

The memecoin sector was one of the most popular spaces in the crypto space, however, in the last 24 hours, a majority of the coins in the sector saw red.
Surprisingly, Solana [SOL] memecoin Jeo Boden [BODEN] was the only top 15 memecoin that did not see red in the past 24 hours. At press time, BODEN was trading at $0.3479 and its price had grown by 18%.
Also, the TRUMP memecoin was trading at $6.23 and its price had surged by 43.07% in the last 24 hours.
As the U.S. presidential elections inch closer, the popularity of tokens such as TRUMP and BODEN may rise, whereas other meme coins may be affected negatively.
However, after the elections are over, the price of these tokens could crash significantly, which could result in massive losses for holders.
Source: X
The hype around these tokens could diminish the market share of popular meme coins such as SHIB, PEPE and WIF.
AMBCrypto’s analysis of Santiment’s data revealed that the social volume around all three of these tokens had declined significantly over the past three months.
WIF and PEPE had the lowest amount of Social Volume at the time of writing, while SHIB performed marginally better.
Source: Santiment
Another factor that can impact both SHIB, PEPE and WIF immensely would be the sentiment around these tokens.
The Weighted Sentiment for SHIB and PEPE was extremely high, indicating that positive comments around these tokens had surged significantly over the last few days.
However, WIF’s Weighted Sentiment had fallen significantly in the last few days, implying that criticisms around the token had soared materially.
The popularity and the sentiment around these tokens will play a great role in dictating what the future looks like for these tokens going forward.

Analyzing price movements
At press time, SHIB was trading at $0.00002274 and its price had fallen by 0.28% in the last 24 hours.
All three of these tokens’ price movements were heavily correlated and showed great similarity over the past few weeks.
After witnessing a price decline since the 25th of April, the prices of these tokens continued to go down till the 1st of May. After this, there was a slight resurgence in terms of price for all tokens.
Source: Santiment
The future price movement of these tokens will also rely heavily on the surrounding momentum.

The RSI (Relative Strength Index) for all these tokens moved in tandem over the last few weeks, and surged significantly. This meant that there was some bullish momentum behind the token’s recent price action.
However, a high RSI could also indicate overbought conditions, which could be detrimental for the tokens going forward.

Cardano Founder Approves Last-Minute Change To Chang Fork


								Charles Hoskinson, founder of the Cardano blockchain, has confirmed the integration of Cardano Improvement Proposal (CIP) 69 into the upcoming Chang hard fork. This announcement was made via X, emphasizing the adaptation to community feedback and aligning with the demands of the Cardano Foundation (CF).
Hoskinson detailed the decision process and its implications: “I saw the requests coming in for CIP-69. I spoke with the IOI delivery team, and they spoke with the folks at Intersect. There seems to be a lot of community demand for it, and the CF also has been pushing for CIP-69 to be included in Chang.”
The Cardano founder highlighted that he doesn’t expect a major delay because of the last-minute inclusion, “I don’t think it will add a significant delay to the delivery of Chang, but it’s important to understand that out of band roadmap changes are always disruptive and introduce additional risk. This said, the dev teams are going to find a way to roll CIP-69 into Chang.”

CIP-69, primarily authored by developers within the Cardano ecosystem, aims to streamline interactions within Cardano’s Plutus smart contracts by standardizing the input arguments across various types of scripts: spending, certifying, rewarding, and minting.
The primary change proposed is the elimination of the datum argument, a piece often linked to locking validators. Instead, validators will solely require a redeemer and the script context for execution, with datums being accessible via the ScriptContext or by an extension in the TxInfo’s Spending constructor.
This proposal addresses a critical design limitation known as the “mutual dependency issue,” where two validators must know each other’s hash. This has been a substantial barrier to the development of safe and effective decentralized applications (DApps) on Cardano, as it constrains the design space and adds complexity to dApp architectures.
Cardano’s Chang Hard Fork
The Chang hard fork, anticipated to occur in Q2 this year, marks a significant milestone in the Cardano roadmap, transitioning into the “Voltaire” era of governance. This era is characterized by a move towards decentralized governance structures, allowing the community to have a greater say in the development and funding of projects within the ecosystem.

Chang is split into two primary upgrades. Chang Upgrade Number 1: Initiates the deployment of governance features, beginning with the technical bootstrapping phase as outlined in SIP 1694. This phase is crucial for setting up the foundational governance mechanisms.
Chang Upgrade Number 2 advances these mechanisms out of the bootstrapping phase and introduces full-fledged on-chain governance capabilities, such as delegated representative participation and treasury withdrawals. This enables the Cardano community not only to vote on proposals but also to fund them, enhancing the ecosystem’s sustainability and responsiveness to user needs.
Hoskinson also highlighted the need for changes in the roadmap construction process post-Chang: “Post-Chang, the entire process for constructing and ratifying a roadmap between hard forks has to be overhauled to reflect the ability to use CIP-1694’s info action to approve a candidate roadmap. There are several working groups at intersect discussing this, and I’d encourage projects and community members to join and discuss to ensure their preferences and suggestions end up in the new process.”
At press time, ADA traded at $0.452.

Stablecoin Volumes May Come from Automated Activity, but Bot Usage Still Drives DeFi Success | Cryptopolitan

Accurate on-chain data are a challenge, but they are key to estimating real activity and trading volume. Stablecoins are one key measure of activity, both to trade volumes and transactions. Decentralized swaps, liquidity mining, and lending require on-chain interactions with smart contracts. That transaction volume, however, does not reflect trading settlements. A recent study by Bloomberg and Allium Labs shows that stablecoin volumes are often not reported accurately, with about 90% of the activity being driven by automated actions or bots. TRON Blockchain Reports Peak USDT ActivityAccurate reporting can be problematic when one set of coins is used in multiple transactions, leading to double-counting. When stablecoin transactions reached Visa’s levels, it became clear that there was a need for more research. However, real persons or settlements may not be tied to the reported on-chain volumes. The most easily visible discrepancy is between unadjusted and adjusted volumes, based on Visa and Allium’s methodology. The adjusted value is about 10% of the unadjusted value, based on repeating transfers of the same funds.Stablecoins exist on several blockchains with a special focus on DeFi. TRON-based assets, including TRON-based USDT, play a significant role in the ecosystem, besides Ethereum.The TRON network has the biggest reported transaction count and value. TRON-based USDT reportedly carried $5.42 trillion in value since the start of 2023, with close to one billion transactions for that same period.On the second spot, the Binance version of USDT carried around $759.9M transactions since 2023, though with a value of just $671B. The high activity level may signify some of the transactions were either micropayments, or automated by bots.Stablecoin Volumes on the Two Biggest NetworksMost prominent L1 and L2 blockchains have launched stablecoins, especially USDT. Those versions supply decentralized pairs or serve as collaterals. But even in 2024, stablecoins are still concentrated on Ethereum and TRON, with a more noticeable growth for Solana. Most of the significant supply growth happens through printing Ethereum or TRON-based USDT. This metric can also be used to gauge market sentiment and readiness to trade. Stablecoins on other blockchains only have a fraction of the supply and a potentially limited effect on activity. Do Bots Harm DeFi Space or Help with Automation?Bot usage is a well-known fact in crypto trading. Some interactions with DEX or smart contracts are too fast for human use. Other activities have been automated to avoid unwanted market movements. Trades, NFT sniping or automated collaterals are not harming DeFi space, but instead increasing its potential. Even beginner traders can get exposed to automation by picking Telegram bot tokens. DeFi activity measures both transactions and active wallets. During some periods, transactions and trades rise without an increased number of users. This discrepancy can suggest the usage of bots. Most decentralized protocols are not immediately opposed to bot usage. The only problem for bot-driven activity is decentralized gaming, where developers aim to bring in real users, with a single wallet tied to a verified identity. But with projects that do not require KYC, multiple wallets and bots remain a viable strategy.Bot Volumes are Not Really FakeBot-driven volumes are not necessarily fake volumes. In fact, they may be tied to personal wallets and work as tools for speed-trading. Telegram bots are in competition to provide those seamless services, where users do not need to manually order transactions. Automated services like BonkBot have handled more than $5.5B in lifetime trades. Bots have also helped drive the latest meme token trend, by minimizing the time from decision to purchase. Bot trading happens on networks that offer a robust DeFi sector and low trading fees. MEV and Telegram bots work on Solana, Arbitrum, Base, Avalanche and Binance Smart Chain.

Cardano's ADA Rallies Amid Bullish Market Projections


							

Cardano’s ADA sees renewed investor interest amid price uptick.



ADA’s trading volume surges 80%, indicating growing interest.



Analyst sees ADA’s parallel channel pattern hinting at a breakout.




Cardano’s ADA has recently faced significant scrutiny, creating a stir within the crypto community. The token has long struggled to breach critical price barriers, suffering a monthly decline of over 25%. Hence, investors have voiced concerns over its sluggish price movement on social media. 



However, in the past week, the trajectory shifted as ADA demonstrated a slight uptick of 1.04%, hovering near $0.45 on the weekly chart. As of press time, ADA stands at $0.4534, marking a 3.22% climb over the last 24 hours.







ADA/USD 24-Hour Chart (Source: CoinStats)



Remarkably, the token has eclipsed Bitcoin’s growth, notching a 4.89% gain over the same interval. This sustained momentum has solidified ADA’s stature as the 10th largest digital asset by market capitalization, reaching $16.16 billion—a 2.84% increase.



ADA’s 24-hour trading volume also saw remarkable expansion, surging over 80% to $514.99 million. These developments reflect growing investor confidence in ADA’s potential for further growth and market stability.



Crypto Analyst Projects Major ADA Rally



In an in-depth dissection presented on TradingView, the distinguished crypto analyst FieryTrading illuminated the possibility of Cardano’s ADA initiating a significant bullish trajectory. This keen insight stems from an earlier evaluation, wherein FieryTrading discerned a pattern similar to that of a parallel channel within ADA’s price fluctuations.



This parallel channel, according to FieryTrading, originated from the previous cycle’s peak and extends to the current cycle’s top. It also includes a line drawn from the last cycle’s bottom, a period marked by a significant drop in crypto prices due to the Covid lockdown. Despite identifying this channel back in 2023, FieryTrading maintains that the pattern remains valid in their current analysis.

In the earlier analysis, FieryTrading had projected that if ADA could break out of this parallel channel, its price could soar as high as $35. This bullish sentiment persists in the latest analysis, though with a slight adjustment in the projected price target. 



On Wednesday, FieryTrading noted that ADA still has the potential to reach the top of the channel, which could see its price move towards $30. However, the analyst’s chart indicates a more conservative target of $25 for ADA. Achieving this target would represent an impressive 5,600% increase from its current price level. 









Can ADA Maintain Its Bullish Trend?



From a technical analysis perspective, Cardano’s ADA shows promising potential. The MACD indicator currently trends at -0.00103, just above the signal line and near the zero level. 







ADA/USD 4-Hour Chart (Source: Tradingview)



This suggests weak buying pressure, but if the MACD line continues to rise above zero, a strong bullish breakout may occur. The green bars on the MACD histogram support this assessment, reflecting positive momentum for ADA’s price.



Similarly, the Chaikin Money Flow indicator is positioned vertically close to the zero line at -0.02, signaling increased money flow into ADA. This uptick indicates a rising interest among investors. If the indicator crosses above the zero line, it could signal further price gains for ADA in the near future.

It Just Got Easier to Mine Single Bitcoin (BTC), Here's Reason

Recent market data shows there is a dramatic shift in the Bitcoin (BTC) network as it relates to mining difficulty. This shift has reduced the mining difficulty, with the hashrate dropping by over 5.6% to 83,148,355,189,239 (83.15 trillion). Per data from BTC.com, this Bitcoin mining difficulty adjustment took place at block height 842,688, with the average hashrate coming in at 646.96 EH/s.Bitcoin network difficulty is a measure of how hard it is for miners to verify transactions and add them to a block for rewards. Network difficulty is computed every two weeks, and the metric rises with increasing computers plugging in to mine more Bitcoin. The opposite trend occurs when there are fewer entities plugged into the network.According to the data, the average network hashrate over the trailing seven-day period comes in at 572.18 EH/s, the biggest slump since at least December 2022. This drop, if sustained, means that for the same resources, miners can get additional output with amplified profitability. With the earnings report by crypto mining firms underway, thus far, the favorable mining difficulty is showcased in their enhanced revenue for the first quarter.The Bitcoin ecosystem is under an intense spotlight with the price of the underlying asset down by $61,135.59, or 2.29%, in 24 hours. The coin has been sliding since it recorded an all-time high (ATH) of $73,750.07. However, long-term traders are confident in the asset’s ability to stay resilient and potentially plot a rebound soon.At the moment, bullish sentiment hinges on the take by CryptoQuant CEO Ki Young Ju, who said the network can support more than 3x of its current valuation. For Bitcoin, this would imply a high of $256,000. With Morgan Stanley and Susquehanna reportedly embracing spot Bitcoin ETFs, the optics and potentials are notably well aligned.

ESMA Considers Adding Crypto to €12T Investment Market, Seeks Expert Opinion | Coinspeaker



ESMA wants feedback by August 7, 2024, about whether UCITS can include assets other than traditional stocks and bonds.

The Europe­an Union (EU) is taking a cautious step towards crypto adoption. The­ European Securities and Marke­ts Authority (ESMA), the bloc’s financial watchdog, is asking for e­xpert views on including crypto assets in the­ €12 trillion ($12.8 trillion) Undertakings for Collective Inve­stment in Transferable Se­curities (UCITS) market.
The strategic move highlights a possible­ shift in the EU’s view on cryptocurre­ncies, which has often leane­d towards tighter regulations. The EU was one­ of the first areas to suggest a full plan for crypto asse­ts, called the Markets in Crypto-Asse­ts Regulation (MiCA), which is still under development.




UCITS are­ a group of investment funds create­d to make investment transactions e­asier and more secure­. These funds, which can be structure­d as mutual funds, exchange-traded funds, or mone­y market funds, are regulate­d by the European Union but available to inve­stors worldwide.
ESMA is asking for feedback, with a de­adline of August 7, 2024, on whether UCITS can include­ exposure to differe­nt types of assets beyond the­ usual stocks and bonds. This list includes structured loans, leve­raged loans, catastrophe bonds, emission allowance­s, commodities, unlisted stocks, and importantly, cryptocurrencie­s.
ESMA’s Cautious Crypto Inclusion
If the European Union’s financial re­gulator approves this proposal, it will not create a standalone­ investment fund e­ntirely composed of cryptocurrencies. Inste­ad, it would pave the way for the cre­ation of multiple investment funds that include­ varying percentages of cryptocurre­ncy assets, catering to investors with diffe­rent risk prefere­nces. 
The Europe­an Union’s regulations currently limit the availability of inde­pendent, crypto-focused inve­stment products. Investors who want this kind of exposure­ have to use exchange­-traded notes (ETNs), which are de­bt-based instruments that follow the price­ of underlying assets like cryptocurre­ncies.
ESMA’s decision line­s up with the trend of regulators be­coming more open to crypto in traditional investme­nts. The recent approval of spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) in the­ US and Hong Kong shows this shift. But it’s important to understand the differe­nce betwee­n these crypto-focused ETFs and the­ varied nature of UCITS funds.
MiCA’s Role in UCITS Regulation
The ESMA is e­xamining how the proposed MiCA regulation could affect including specific cryptocurre­ncies in the UCITS framework. MiCA aims to cre­ate a comprehensive­ regulatory system for crypto assets across the­ EU. It’s unclear how these two rule­s will work together and if they will make­ it easier to integrate­ crypto into the UCITS market.
The­ EU’s exploration of crypto inclusion within UCITS is a significant development. It suggests the­ EU may be more open to cryptocurre­ncies, which could lead to wider crypto adoption in Europe­an investments. Howeve­r, with MiCA still evolving and questions about how to add crypto to UCITS, the path to mainstre­am crypto integration in the EU will likely be­ gradual and cautious.

AI Favorite ARM Earnings Show Cracks Appearing In Ultra Bullish AI Story - ARM Holdings (NASDAQ:ARM) - Benzinga

To gain an edge, this is what you need to know today.Cracks In Ultra Bullish AI StoryPlease click here for an enlarged chart of Arm Holdings PLC - ADR ARM.Note the following:
	This article is about the big picture, not an individual stock. The chart of ARM stock is being used to illustrate the point.
	ARM has been one of the top artificial intelligence favorites of the momo crowd.
	ARM is a British semiconductor design firm that is mostly owned by Japanese company SoftBank Group Corp - ADR SFTBY. ARM is known for licensing its designs for smartphone CPUs, such as those used in Apple’s iPhones. Lately, ARM has been pivoting to artificial intelligence.
	The chart shows the gap down after the release of this quarter’s earnings. This indicates another crack in the ultra bullish short-term AI story promoted by momo gurus.
	The chart shows a gap up after last quarter earnings.
	Here are the details of ARM earnings:
	
		ARM reported Q4 (March) earnings of $0.36 vs. $0.30 consensus.
		Revenues came at $928M vs. $866M consensus.
		Revenues rose 46.6% year-over-year.
		For Q1 (June), the company projects earnings of $0.32 - $0.36 vs. $0.31 consensus.
		The company projects revenues of $875M - $925M vs. $866M consensus.
		For FY25, the company projects earnings of $1.45 - $1.65 vs. $1.54 consensus.
		The company sees revenues of $3.8B - $4.1B vs. $3.98B consensus.
		Royalty revenue was $514M up 37% year-over-year.
	
	
	The chart shows that from the peak after last quarter earnings to the recent low, ARM stock lost 47.8% of its value.
	The Arora Report was one of the first to pick up on the AI theme back in 2022 allowing readers and members of The Arora Report to buy artificial intelligence stocks near the lows before the run up started. NVIDIA Corp NVDA is a perfect example of the benefit of knowing early that a change is underway. Click here to see a chart of The Arora Report signals for NVDA.
	ARM stock is falling for two reasons.
	
		Whisper numbers had moved much higher above the consensus going into earnings.  Stocks move based on the difference between whisper numbers and the actual numbers.  Whisper numbers are the numbers that analysts privately share with their best clients.  Whisper numbers are often different from the numbers the same analysts publish.  Whisper numbers is a technique used by analysts to drum up business. This is the reason that prudent investors do not depend on free data that floats around the internet and on the media. Prudent investors know better, but unfortunately many individual investors do analysis based on the free data and then spend years trying to figure out why their analysis never works out.
	

	
		ARM beat the consensus numbers for the prior quarter and raised numbers for the current quarter over the consensus. However, it did not help because whisper numbers were so much higher.
	

	
		For FY25, ARM guidance, even though inline with the consensus numbers, is way below the whisper numbers.
	
	
	On a separate note, in The Arora Report analysis Airbnb Inc ABNB projections indicate that the consumer may be pulling back on summer travel.
	Jobless claims came at 231K vs. 213K consensus. This indicates that the job market is beginning to slow.
U.K.Bank of England (BOE) left its key interest rate unchanged at 5.25%. BOE is expected to cut rates in June.BOE Governor Andrew Bailey says that BOE may reduce interest rates faster than markets expect.   In The Arora Report analysis, BOE moves will likely encourage Powell to do what he is itching to do irrespective of the data.ChinaThe Chinese economy appears to be rebounding. Exports increased 1.5% year-over-year vs. 1.0% consensus.Magnificent Seven Money FlowsIn the early trade, money flows are neutral in Apple Inc AAPL, Amazon.com, Inc. AMZN, Alphabet Inc Class C GOOG, and Microsoft Corp MSFT.In the early trade, money flows are negative in Meta Platforms Inc META, Tesla Inc TSLA, and NVDA.In the early trade, money flows are negative in SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust SPY and Invesco QQQ Trust Series 1 QQQ.Momo Crowd And Smart Money In StocksThe momo crowd is buying stocks in the early trade. Smart money is selling stocks in the early trade.GoldThe momo crowd is inactive in the early trade. Smart money is inactive in the early trade.For longer-term, please see gold and silver ratings.The most popular ETF for gold is SPDR Gold Trust GLD. The most popular ETF for silver is iShares Silver Trust SLV. OilThe momo crowd is buying oil in the early trade. Smart money is inactive in the early trade.For longer-term, please see oil ratings.The most popular ETF for oil is United States Oil ETF USO.BitcoinBitcoin BTC/USD is seeing selling.Protection Band And What To Do NowIt is important for investors to look ahead and not in the rearview mirror.Consider continuing to hold good, very long term, existing positions. Based on individual risk preference, consider a protection band consisting of cash or Treasury bills or short-term tactical trades as well as short to medium term hedges and short term hedges. This is a good way to protect yourself and participate in the upside at the same time.You can determine your protection bands by adding cash to hedges. The high band of the protection is appropriate for those who are older or conservative. The low band of the protection is appropriate for those who are younger or aggressive. If you do not hedge, the total cash level should be more than stated above but significantly less than cash plus hedges.A protection band of 0% would be very bullish and would indicate full investment with 0% in cash. A protection band of 100% would be very bearish and would indicate a need for aggressive protection with cash and hedges or aggressive short selling.It is worth reminding that you cannot take advantage of new upcoming opportunities if you are not holding enough cash. When adjusting hedge levels, consider adjusting partial stop quantities for stock positions (non ETF); consider using wider stops on remaining quantities and also allowing more room for high beta stocks.  High beta stocks are the ones that move more than the market.Traditional 60/40 PortfolioProbability based risk reward adjusted for inflation does not favor long duration strategic bond allocation at this time.Those who want to stick to traditional 60% allocation to stocks and 40% to bonds may consider focusing on only high quality bonds and bonds of seven year duration or less. Those willing to bring sophistication to their investing may consider using bond ETFs as tactical positions and not strategic positions at this time.The Arora Report is known for its accurate calls.

Here’s Why Ethereum (ETH) Has Been Lagging Behind Bitcoin (BTC), According to Glassnode - The Daily Hodl


								Market intelligence firm Glassnode says Ethereum (ETH) has been lagging behind Bitcoin (BTC) for one key reason.
In a new analysis, Glassnode says that Ethereum has not seen the same level of increased capital from new buyers that Bitcoin has in the current market cycle, which drove the crypto king to new all-time highs (ATHs).










The analysts say that the approval of spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) was likely a main driver for the increase in short-term holders who bought BTC in the last 155 days.
“In the run-up to Bitcoin’s all-time high on March 14th, there was a noticeable increase in speculative activity. Specifically, capital accumulation has been observed among short-term holders (STHs), with the USD wealth held within coins moved within the last six months approaching $240 billion, near ATHs. However, this trend has not been mirrored for ETH, which has not yet seen price break above the 2021 ATH. 
Whilst Bitcoin’s STH-Realized Cap is nearly on par with the last bull run peak, ETH’s STH-Realized Cap has barely lifted off the lows, suggesting a markedly lackluster inflow of new capital. In many ways, this lack of new capital inflows is a reflection of the underperformance of ETH relative to BTC. This is likely in part due to the attention and access brought about by the spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds.”
Source: Glassnode
The Realized Cap metric records the price at which each coin moved and aims to gauge how many holders are in profit or at a loss.
Source: Glassnode
The analysts suggest ETH could see a large capital inflow if the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) approves spot Ethereum ETF applications later this month.
 “The market is still awaiting the SEC’s decision for approval of a suite of ETH ETFs expected towards the end of May.”
Bitcoin is trading for $61,454 at time of writing, down more than 2.6% in the last 24 hours. Meanwhile, Ethereum is trading for $2,970 at time of writing, down more than 2.7% on the day.

Analyst Warns Ethereum's Fate Is Tied To Bitcoin: 'If ETH Goes Up From Here, It Would Only Be Due To...' - Benzinga

In a recent development, esteemed analyst Benjamin Cowen has suggested that the future of Ethereum ETH/USD may be heavily influenced by Bitcoin’s BTC/USD performance, potentially leading to further downside for the former.What Happened: According to Cowen, Ethereum could only see a rise if Bitcoin experiences a substantial surge, Daily Hodl reported on Thursday.“If ETH goes up from here, it would only be due to Bitcoin going up a lot more,” he said.Moreover, Cowen anticipates that the Ethereum/Bitcoin (ETH/BTC) pair will likely maintain its downward trend in most scenarios, based on historical patterns. He pointed out, “In eight of 10 quarters, Ethereum/Bitcoin has gone down whether Bitcoin went up, down or sideways.”Cowen also cautioned that monetary policy could adversely affect Ethereum, stating, “ETH/USD is still facing some headwinds here, especially following the potential rejection of the spot exchange-traded fund (ETF).”See Also: Here’s How Much $1,000 Invested In Dogecoin Would be Worth If You Invested When Elon Musk First Tweeted About DOGEWhy It Matters: Ethereum has been characterized as this cycle’s underperformer in the cryptocurrency market, with ongoing challenges impacting its valuation and adoption. Despite its strong historical correlation with Bitcoin, Ethereum’s fundamentals are seen as a potential barrier to broader investment in the cryptocurrency ecosystem.Price Action: On Thursday, Bitcoin was trading 0.42% higher at $61,449.78 and Ethereum was trading 0.08% higher at $2,981.32 at the time of writing, according to Benzinga Pro.Read Next: Bitcoin, Ethereum, Dogecoin Continue To Slip: Analyst Says King Crypto Network Fundamentals Indicate 300% Upside, Could Top Between $250K-$275KPhoto by DUSAN ZIDAR on Shutterstock

Binance: dismissal of DWF Labs investigator

Binance has proceeded to fire the investigator who had discovered market manipulation by the client DWF Labs. 
The former employee and his colleagues in Binance’s market surveillance team had been tasked with identifying signs of illicit activity. The team had prepared a report highlighting the manipulation of various tokens by DWF Labs, a client of Binance.
Let’s see below all the details. 

The dismissal by Binance of the investigator who had discovered irregularities at the client DWF Labs
As anticipated, according to what was reported by the Wall Street Journal, Binance fired an employee who had discovered evidence of market manipulation by DWF Labs.
This is an investment company in cryptocurrencies and one of the exchange’s clients. The news is based on interviews with former and current Binance employees, documents, emails, and other industry participants.
The former employee and his Binance market surveillance team were hired to identify signs of market manipulation and other illicit activities, as part of the exchange’s efforts to ensure compliance with regulations. 
The team discovered that some “VIP” customers, those who trade more than 100 million dollars per month, were involved in pump-and-dump and wash trading schemes, violating Binance’s terms of use.
DWF Labs, which was processing over 4 billion dollars in monthly transactions, became a significant investor in cryptocurrency projects in early 2023, when it participated in several funding rounds in a generally stable market. 
Unlike the traditional venture capital model, DWF Labs, founded by high-frequency cryptocurrency traders, would purchase millions of dollars worth of tokens at a discount, earning profits when their price increased.
Accusations of wash trading: Binance and DWF Labs respond to investigations
Binance investigators have presented a report claiming that DWF Labs had manipulated the price of several tokens with $300 million in wash trading in 2023. 
However, Binance stated that there was not enough evidence of market abuse, according to the WSJ. One week after the report was filed, the head of the team was fired.
Binance told the WSJ that the accusations against DWF Labs were not “fully proven” and rejected the idea of tolerating market manipulation. 
Subsequently, DWF Labs responded on X (previously Twitter), stating that the accusations were “unfounded and distort the facts.”
Binance has also released a response, without mentioning the employee’s dismissal. “We do not tolerate market abuse,” reads a post on X. 
“In the last three years, we have removed nearly 355,000 users with a transaction volume exceeding 2.5 trillion dollars for violations of our terms of use.”
Binance adds USDC to the Dual Investment platform
Binance has recently introduced USDC into its Dual Investment platform, offering users a wider range of investment opportunities. 
Thanks to this new addition, users can now use “Buy Low” and “Sell High” type products with a variety of USDC pairs, allowing them to earn rewards on the most popular cryptocurrencies.
The Binance Dual Investment allows users to set the price and settlement date to buy or sell cryptocurrencies in the future, without fees. 
This option offers flexibility and potential earnings to those who wish to invest in cryptocurrencies at a lower price or earn higher returns on their holdings.
Users who want to accumulate rewards on their cryptocurrencies or sell at higher prices in the future can take advantage of the “Sell High” option, which supports currencies like BTC, ETH, BNB, SOL, and many others.
For those looking to invest in stablecoins or buy cryptocurrencies at lower prices, the “Buy Low” option is based on USDC.
It is important to keep in mind that Dual Investment may suspend new registrations at any time and that the APR (annual percentage rate) may vary depending on market conditions. 
Binance recommends users to use the Dual Investment Beginner mode, which provides a detailed guide to the subscription process and a glossary of important terms.
Overall, the integration of USDC into Binance’s Dual Investment platform expands investment options, offering users greater opportunities to earn rewards on the most popular cryptocurrencies.

Solana Slerf to Rally 9,000%, as it Looks to Take on Shiba Inu, Bonk and Dogecoin



                    

Solana Slerf (SOLSLERF) could become a viral memecoin, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Bonk (BONK) and Dogecoin (DOGE).



Solana Slerf (SOLSLERF), a Solana memecoin that was launched this week, is aiming to challenge other memecoin giants, such as Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE).




Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Solana Slerf presents a similar opportunity.



Solana Slerf has market cap below $10,000 at the moment, meaning that when it just reaches a modest market cap of $200,000-$500,000, early investors would generate returns of 2,000%-5,000% in a matter of days or hours.



The exciting memecoin is poised to rally 9,000% in the coming two days, and Solana Slerf could potentially reach a multi-million dollar market cap within a few weeks.



Currently, Solana Slerf can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jupiter and Raydium, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days.



To buy Solana Slerf on these platforms, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Solana Slerf by entering its contract address – D2R7sKwPNpWGtEfMJiLVe5G2ZJbExnk98PEft2dhyCrL – in the receiving field.



In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price.



If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner.




The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum.



This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like SOLSLERF.

How UK's Staking and Stablecoin Rules Could Shape Its Future - DailyCoin


        
The UK has prepared to unveil new crypto regulations targeting staking and stablecoins.



This move aims to solidify the UK’s status as a crypto hub, but political uncertainties are challenging it.



The regulations’ success hinges on balancing investor protection and fostering a thriving crypto sector.
The United Kingdom is inching closer to a significant milestone for cryptocurrency enthusiasts. The government, led by the Conservative Party, is on the verge of passing new regulations focused on staking and stablecoins, aiming to solidify the UK’s position as a global hub for digital assets.UK Considers Rules for StakingThis push for regulation comes amid increasing crypto adoption worldwide. Staking, a process where users lock up their holdings to participate in network validation and earn rewards, has become a popular way to generate passive income within the crypto ecosystem. 
On the other hand, stablecoins are cryptocurrencies pegged to a stable asset like the US dollar, offering price stability absent in most traditional cryptocurrencies. Economic Secretary Bim Afolami, a key figure spearheading the legislative effort, recently emphasized the urgency of these regulations at the Financial Times Crypto and Digital Asset Summit. “What I’m very confident we’ll be able to achieve is the secondary legislation around staking and stablecoins. Those two things are absolute priorities in the coming weeks and months,” Afolami stated.The Conservative Party’s crypto ambitions, however, face potential roadblocks. Recent local election losses to the Labour Party highlight a shifting political landscape that could impact the legislative process. The looming general election adds another layer of uncertainty.UK Crypto Regulations: Good or Bad for Investors?Despite these challenges, the government remains committed to its crypto agenda. They believe these regulations will enhance market stability and provide a clear and structured framework for the UK’s crypto sector. Establishing a transparent and well-regulated environment could, in turn, attract more businesses and bolster investor confidence.The UK’s staking and stablecoin regulations have the potential to significantly shape its future as a hub for cryptocurrency activity, with both potential benefits and drawbacks to consider:Potential Benefits
Increased Investor Confidence: Clear and well-defined regulations can create a more secure and stable environment for cryptocurrency activities. This can attract more investors, both domestic and international, who might be hesitant to enter a largely unregulated market.



Market Stability: Regulations can help mitigate risks associated with fraud and manipulation in the crypto market. This can lead to greater stability in cryptocurrency prices, making them more attractive for mainstream adoption.



Innovation and Economic Growth: A thriving crypto sector in the UK can attract new businesses and foster innovation in blockchain technology. This could lead to job creation and economic growth, solidifying the UK’s position as a global financial center.
Potential Drawbacks
Stifling Innovation: Overly restrictive regulations could stifle innovation in the crypto sector. This could hinder the development of new technologies and applications, putting the UK at a disadvantage compared to countries with more lenient regulations.



Reduced Competitiveness: Stringent regulations could make the UK a less attractive destination for crypto businesses than countries with more relaxed regulatory frameworks. This could lead to missed opportunities for economic growth.



Political Uncertainty: The upcoming general election in the UK injects uncertainty into the legislative process. A change in government could lead to a shift in priorities, potentially delaying or even stalling the implementation of these regulations.
Overall, the impact of the UK’s staking and stablecoin regulations will depend on how effectively they strike a balance between fostering innovation and protecting investors. If successful, these regulations could propel the UK to the forefront of the global crypto scene. However, if they are too restrictive, they could hinder the growth of the crypto sector and limit the UK’s potential in this rapidly evolving space.On the Flipside
The proposed regulations only target staking and stablecoins, leaving other aspects of the crypto industry unregulated. 



The UK’s regulations might not align with those of other countries, creating fragmentation and complicating cross-border crypto activities for businesses and investors.
Why This MattersThe UK’s regulations targeting staking and stablecoins could set a precedent for global crypto adoption. A successful framework could attract investment, boost stability, and solidify the UK as a crypto hub, but overly strict rules risk stifling innovation and competitiveness. This delicate balance will determine the regulations’ impact on the cryptocurrency market’s future.Interested in how the UK tackles crypto crime?

Obligate to Utilize Lisk's Layer 2 Network With New Deployment



                    

Lisk, a key player in the Layer 2 blockchain arena and part of the Optimism Superchain, has announced a strategic collaboration with Obligate, a Swiss-based on-chain capital markets platform known for its innovative financial services on the blockchain. This partnership marks a significant step for both entities as they leverage Lisk’s network to enhance decentralized financial services, particularly in emerging markets.



Obligate will operate on Lisk L2, which is celebrated for its high efficiency, speed, and scalability. This integration is underpinned by Ethereum within the Optimism Superchain framework, ensuring robust security and performance. The primary aim of this collaboration is to empower businesses in emerging markets by offering easier access to capital solutions through blockchain technology, thereby bypassing traditional banking hurdles like high interest rates and intermediaries.




Dominic Schwenter, CPO of Lisk, expressed his enthusiasm about the partnership, stating, “Lisk has consistently led the way in making blockchain technology accessible, focusing specifically on solving real-world problems in emerging markets. Integrating Obligate’s platform with Lisk not only promotes financial inclusion but also pioneers advanced solutions for real-world assets (RWA) and off-chain assets (OCA). This deployment is a crucial step towards our goal of introducing the next billion people to the Web3 ecosystem.”



Echoing Schwenter’s sentiments, Benedikt Schuppli, co-founder of Obligate, highlighted the synergy between Lisk L2’s capabilities and Obligate’s mission. “Lisk L2’s design to support real-world applications and assets aligns perfectly with Obligate’s mission to offer secure and regulated blockchain solutions. Our partnership will provide robust, efficient, and transparent financial options to the regions most in need, and we are eager to witness the positive impacts of our joint efforts.”



The deployment of Obligate on Lisk L2 holds particular significance for its potential to transform how businesses utilize real-world assets for funding. By streamlining the access to capital, Lisk L2 and Obligate aim to enable businesses to leverage their physical assets more effectively, fostering economic growth and stability in challenging markets.




This collaboration not only utilizes Lisk L2’s technological advantages, such as enhanced scalability and improved user experience, but also sets a precedent for adopting blockchain solutions in markets with diverse technological infrastructures.

Did Regulations Push LocalMonero Out? Privacy Coin Platform Bites The Dust


								The winds of regulatory change are howling through the cryptocurrency space, and a prominent victim has emerged. LocalMonero, a veteran P2P (peer-to-peer) trading platform for the privacy-focused Monero (XMR) coin, announced its closure on May 7th, citing a combination of “internal and external factors.” This move has sent shockwaves through the Monero community and reignited the debate between financial privacy and regulatory oversight.

LocalMonero: P2P Platforms In The Crosshairs
LocalMonero’s demise comes amidst a period of heightened scrutiny by US authorities towards the crypto industry. From the arrest of the developers behind the privacy-focused Samourai Wallet to the SEC’s crackdown on centralized exchanges like Robinhood, regulators are wielding a heavy hand in an effort to enforce anti-money laundering (AML) and securities laws. P2P platforms, with their decentralized nature and potential for anonymous transactions, have become a particular point of concern.


While the exact reasons behind LocalMonero’s closure remain shrouded in some mystery, the timing paints a bleak picture. The platform’s decision to shut down follows a warning from the Financial Action Task Force (FATF), an intergovernmental watchdog, highlighting the potential misuse of P2P platforms for illicit financing. This, coupled with the ongoing delisting of privacy coins by major centralized exchanges, creates a chilling effect on the entire privacy-focused crypto ecosystem.

Privacy Vs. Regulation: A Collision Course
The closure of LocalMonero has sparked outrage and fear within the Monero community. Many see it as a blatant attack on their right to financial privacy. Freedom advocates have labeled the current regulatory landscape a “war on crypto,” urging users to band together and learn about digital privacy tools. They also compare the government’s approach to “terrorism,” arguing that it stifles innovation and creates an atmosphere of fear.

However, the concerns of regulators shouldn’t be entirely dismissed. Privacy coins, with their ability to obfuscate transaction details, can indeed be attractive for those seeking to launder money or finance illegal activities. Striking a balance between user privacy and effective AML/KYC (Know Your Customer) regulations is a complex challenge.
The Future of Privacy-Focused Crypto
The future of privacy-focused crypto projects like Monero hangs in the balance. While LocalMonero remains optimistic, pointing to upcoming developments within the Monero ecosystem like Haveno DEX and Full Chain Member Proofs (FCMP), the regulatory pressure is undeniable.

2024 Ushers in a New Era for DeFi Yields: Sustained Growth Through Organic Demand

Users who are uncomfortable lending against exotic new assets, like Ethena’s sUSDe or liquid restaking tokens, can lend via tried-and-true protocols like Compound and Aave. The Ethena and EigenLayer assets have not been onboarded as collateral for Aave and Compound, where ETH, staked ETH, and USDC remain the primary forms of collateral.

Airbnb Shares Slide Over 6% on Weaker-Than-Expected Q2 Outlook - Tokenist


					
Neither the author, Tim Fries, nor this website, The Tokenist, provide financial advice. Please consult our website policy prior to making financial decisions.



Airbnb Inc. (NASDAQ: ABNB) shares tumbled more than 6% on Wednesday after the vacation rental company issued a weaker-than-expected outlook for the current quarter.



The stock had gained about 9.34% over the past 12 months. For the quarter ending March 2024, Airbnb had reported an EPS of $0.41, beating expectations by approximately 75%.



Airbnb Stock Price Update



Airbnb shares fell over 6% since the market opened at the time of writing, trading at $147. The stock finds a zone of support between $141 and $148 from the 200-day moving average and price action dating back to September last year.



However, failure to hold above this support zone opens the door for Airbnb’s stock price to potentially decline to lower support around $126.





Why Airbnb Stock Dipped Today



Airbnb reported first-quarter revenue of $2.14 billion, up 18% year-over-year, and adjusted earnings per share of $0.41, beating analyst estimates of $2.06 billion in revenue and $0.24 EPS. Despite the strong results, Airbnb’s second-quarter revenue forecast of $2.68-$2.74 billion, representing 8-10% growth, had its midpoint below the $2.74 billion Wall Street consensus, disappointing investors.



The company cited headwinds to second-quarter results from the timing of Easter, an extra leap-year day in the first quarter, and foreign exchange fluctuations. Jefferies maintained a Hold rating and $150 price target on Airbnb stock, stating that the results failed to ease growing fears of slowing growth. Morgan Stanley kept an Underweight rating and $120 target as room night growth continues to underwhelm.



Bank of America acknowledged Airbnb’s strong first-quarter performance but noted that the company’s outlook reflects slowing travel growth. As a result, BofA cut its price target on Airbnb stock to $160 from $168.

Ripple and XRPL Labs Join Digital Asset Recovery Protocol DeRec Alliance | Coinspeaker



The DeRec Alliance now has Ripple and XRPL Labs as founding members, as they develop a protocol for easy asset recovery.

Ripple and XRP Labs are now members of the Decentralized Recovery (DeRec) Alliance, an association formed to create an open-source and industry-standard methodology to simplify digital asset recovery. Along with Hedera blockchain network developer Swirld Labs, and the Algorand Foundation, Ripple and XRPL Labs are the founding members of the DeRec Alliance.
DeRec Alliance Simplifies for Crypto Asset Recovery
An official press release notes that today’s Web3 applications require a “highly sophisticated user” that understands and can handle the task of securing sensitive information, including digital assets, keys, accounts, and passwords. With decentralized recovery, self-custody, cold storage, and other forms of account recovery are unnecessary.




The Alliance was founded by Dr. Leemon Baird, also the co-founder of Hedera. Baird stated:
“The DeRec Alliance is a group of individuals and organizations committed to making the process of securing and recovering digital assets, accounts, passwords, and other secrets as simple as existing Web2 experiences. We encourage every blockchain and every industry to work together to create the standards and the open source code needed to bring safety to the promise of Web3, without the complexity.”
Members of the DeRec Alliance also include The Hashgraph Association, Casper Association, Acoer, and Constellation Network. Others are The HBAR Foundation, Revive Labs, The Building Blocks, Blade Labs, and BankSocial. All Alliance members are tasked with providing input and feedback on policies that will help create an interoperable recovery standard. The plan is to ease the recovery and adoption of crypto and other assets.
According to Markus Infanger, Senior Vice President of RippleX, the developer and community platform created by Ripple, The DeRec Alliance solves one of the biggest problems facing crypto adoption. Infanger said by developing clear standards for key recovery, the Alliance gives users more control and boosts their confidence. XRPL Labs founder and CEO Wietse Wind echoed Infanger’s sentiments, adding that user-friendly solutions for key recovery are essential to mass retail adoption.
The DeRec Alliance features a Technical Oversight Committee (TOC) with two-year seats filled by founding members. The TOC’s function is to offer input on the Alliance’s governance structure and core policies.
DeRec Protocol Shares Secrets among “Helpers”
The Alliance’s method is the Decentralized Recovery (DeRec) open-source protocol that takes a secret-sharing approach to recovery data management. The protocol helps a user share secrets among a list of helpers (businesses or friends)that can help the user recover their secret whenever necessary. Each helper’s share does not indicate any information about the original secret, which can only be properly compiled by the original user. Also, the user can reconstruct their original secret even if only half the helpers reveal their shares. This works even if the user has lost their primary two-factor recovery device, such as their phone.
To maintain availability, the DeRec protocol periodically uses regular confirmations to ensure that helpers still hold their shares of the secret. In addition, the protocol initiates automatic re-sharing whenever the secret changes, or a helper leaves or joins. Throughout the process, the user never has to reveal any helper’s identity or the number of helpers they have. In the same way, helpers also do not have information about other helpers.

Binance Rejects Secret Crypto Settlement as Nigerian Authorities Detain Compliance Chief



                    

Recent revelations have surfaced regarding the interactions between Nigerian officials and Binance representatives, implicating that Nigerian authorities attempted to pressure Binance into an undisclosed settlement paid in cryptocurrency. 



These events reportedly transpired during meetings early in 2024.




Binance’s CEO, Richard Teng, has spoken out about the situation, specifically addressing the ongoing detention of Tigran Gambaryan, a former agent of the United States Internal Revenue Service and the current head of Binance’s financial crime compliance team. Gambaryan was detained in Nigeria while on a business trip. 



According to Teng, this incident marks a concerning precedent as it reflects the potential risks global companies may face when operating internationally.



Teng’s statement condemned the Nigerian government’s approach, claiming it set a “dangerous new precedent for all companies worldwide” following the detainment of Gambaryan and another employee. 




He narrated how Binance made efforts to engage positively with Nigerian officials, participating in regulatory discussions and collaborating with law enforcement to address any concerns transparently.



The matter escalated after Binance was invited to a public investigative hearing by the chairman of the House of Representatives Committee on Financial Crimes (HCFC). 



Despite being prepared to address any allegations in a public forum, Teng noted that the details of the accusations were not provided to them, leading to their request to respond in writing, a proposal still pending response from the committee.



Amidst these discussions, Binance personnel were approached by unidentified individuals offering to settle the allegations secretly using cryptocurrency, demanding a substantial payment within 48 hours.

Teng disclosed that their local legal counsel was presented with these terms by an agent of the HCFC, emphasizing the secretive and urgent nature of the deal. Binance declined the offer and continued to seek a diplomatic resolution to the matter.



Following the refusal, further meetings were arranged involving representatives from various Nigerian governmental bodies, including the National Security Adviser’s office and the Central Bank of Nigeria, among others. 



Despite the complexity of the situation, Teng stated that Gambaryan and Nadeem Anjarwalla, head of Binance Africa, were assured of their safety for these meetings.



However, the situation worsened when Nigerian officials detained Gambaryan and Anjarwalla, confiscated their passports and phones, and demanded that Binance comply with specific requests, including delisting the Nigerian naira from their platform. 



In response to the escalating demands and the continued detention of its employees, Binance has temporarily shut down certain services in Nigeria, hoping to secure their release and resolve the situation amicably.

Robinhood (HOOD) Wells Notice Shouldn’t Deter Eventual SEC Approval of an Ether (ETH) Spot ETF: JPMorgan

The popular trading platform received the notice – a preliminary warning from the regulator about potential enforcement action – on May 4, the company said in a filing on Monday. The notice should be viewed as a “continued attempt by the SEC to reinforce its position that all crypto tokens outside bitcoin and ether should be classified as securities,” analysts led by Nikolaos Panigirtzoglou wrote.

Binance banned Tron Foundation for market manipulation, report


A report from the Wall Street Journal has alleged that on multiple occasions, Binance ignored its own internal investigations about market manipulation in favor of preserving relationships with important clients. 
In one case in 2023, a trading firm called DWF Labs, led by Russian Andrei Grachev, was making over $4 billion in trades on Binance per month. DWF allegedly offered a service to clients where it would create “artificial volume” and drive up the price of tokens. 
One example described in the report is about Yield Guild Games, a token that DWF invested in. Grachev tweeted about it, DWF sold a huge number of tokens, and very shortly afterwards, the price of the token collapsed. 

Following some of these events, the internal surveillance team at Binance recommended removing DWF and included wash trades it identified as part of this analysis.
However, a second internal Binance team investigated the surveillance team, allegedly determining that the wash trades conducted by the firm, which advertised its ability to create “artificial volume,” may have been accidental, after which Binance chose not to offload DWF Labs.
The report claims that two traders accounted for two-thirds of all Binance volume in 2023, which may have motivated the reticence.
This internal surveillance team also raised concerns about Binance’s own internal accounts trading cryptocurrencies on Binance, an allegation which was echoed in the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) complaint that Binance recently settled.

Following the surveillance team’s report about DWF, the Wall Street Journal noted that the head of the team was fired, several other investigators were ‘laid-off’ as a ‘cost-saving measure’, and others resigned. 
Tron and Justin Sun
Grachev previously worked for Huobi, now HTX, leading it’s Russian arm. HTX is advised by Justin Sun, who also leads the Tron Foundation, which also ran afoul of Binance’s internal investigators.
In the months following Sun and the Tron Foundation being charged by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) with market manipulation and wash trading last year, Binance decided to off-board the Tron Foundation. 
However, despite the alleged market manipulation of the Tron Foundation, Binance did still decide to make TrueUSD a ‘zero-fee’ base asset for a variety of trading pairs around the same time they were offboarding Tron Foundation. Sun has been accused of owning TrueUSD but denies the accusations. Sun has admitted he is a ‘partner market maker’ for this asset, and the previous issues with Sun projects manipulating markets did not prevent Binance from embracing this project. 

More recently, the market cap of TrueUSD has collapsed as Binance has moved to other stablecoins like First Digital USD.
The Wall Street Journal report alleges a culture of allowing illicit activity to continue as long as it benefits Binance.

Cardano (ADA), the 10th-largest cryptocurrency by market cap, has recently experienced a remarkable surge in trading volume, coinciding with a surprising reversal in its price trajectory. This sudden uptick in activity has caught the attention of traders and investors, sparking speculation. According to CoinMarketCap data, Cardano's (ADA) trading volume has risen over 90% in the last 24 hours, with nearly half a billion dollars ($500 million) exchanged. This surge in volume suggests a significant influx of buying and selling activity, indicative of higher market activity and increased liquidity for the cryptocurrency.With the spike in trading volume, ADA's price has unexpectedly reversed. After three consecutive days of declines, ADA's price rebounded to reach highs of $0.469 on May 8. ADA was still sustaining its prior day gains at the time of writing, unlike the majority in the top 10, including Bitcoin and Ethereum, which traded in the red.ADA/USD Daily Chart, Courtesy: TradingViewADA was up 1.56% in the last 24 hours at the time of writing to $0.452, having erased some of its gains. This seeming reversal has sparked renewed enthusiasm among the Cardano community and potential investors, who are now keenly observing ADA price performance.Also, several cryptocurrencies are seeing a decline in trading volume, indicating that traders have been indecisive. This context makes Cardano's volume increase all the more significant, as it bucks the general market trend.Given the recent increase in both volume and price for ADA, the crypto community is keeping a careful eye on whether this trend will continue. On the upside, ADA meets its next resistance level at $0.476; if prices fall, support will be seen near the $0.418 level.

Donald Trump Says 'You Better Vote' For Him If You're Pro-Crypto: But Has He Always Been 'Fine With It'? - Benzinga

Former U.S. President Donald Trump on Wednesday publicly endorsed cryptocurrency, declaring it a significant election issue—a move that contrasts with President Joe Biden‘s perceived unfamiliarity with the crypto world.What Happened: In a series of video clips uploaded by Frank Degods, a notable NFT creator and influencer, Trump expressed his support for the crypto industry.Addressing a group of buyers of his NFTs, Trump contrasted his approach with that of President Joe Biden: “I’m fine with it,” Trump stated, adding, “If you like crypto in any form… if you’re in favor of crypto you’d better vote for Trump.” His comments were met with enthusiasm from the crypto community.The remarks were reportedly made during a gathering organized by Trump to meet with purchasers of his “Mugshot Edition” NFTs. Attendees, who individually acquired over 47 NFTs priced at $99 each, were treated to dinner with the former president. Trump emphasized his role in revitalizing interest in NFTs, declaring, "We made NFTs hot again."Trump also addressed the issue of crypto firms leaving the US due to what he termed as “hostility” from Democrats and Securities and Exchange Commission Chair Gary Gensler. He emphasized the need to embrace these firms.Also Read: JPMorgan Analysts Optimistic About Future Approval Of Spot Ether ETFs Despite Regulatory HurdlesWhy It Matters: This marks a significant shift in Trump’s stance on crypto, having previously dismissed Bitcoin as a scam against the dollar in 2021. He also called crypto a “disaster waiting to happen” in 2021. The former President warmed up to digital assets over time, noting in March this year that he is “having fun with crazy new currencies.” Avichal Garg, Co-founder of Electric Capital, lauded Trump’s evolving stance on crypto, suggesting it could have implications for the political landscape. However, Trump's campaign declined to provide further comment on the matter.The comments come on the same day as President Biden’s announcement that he would veto a resolution seeking to repeal a Securities and Exchange Commission accounting policy, which makes it more expensive for financial institutions to custody digital assets.What’s Next: These topics are poised to be hotly debated at Benzinga’s Future of Digital Assets event on Nov. 19, where industry leaders will discuss the evolving relationship between cryptocurrency and mainstream politics.Read Next: Is Ethereum ‘This Cycle’s Basket Case’? 10x Research Points Out ETH’s ‘Only Bull Story’Image: Shutterstock

Ether Reverts to Inflationary Asset Following Fee-Reducing Dencun Upgrade

Ether was a deflationary asset following the Merge, with the total supply of the token dropping from 120.491 million to 120.097 million since September 2022. However, the total amount of fees burned decoupled from network activity following Dencun, meaning that the natural increase in supply is outpacing the amount burned in fees. Ether's supply has thus increased by 400,000 tokens since April.

Elon Musk Enables Dogecoin (DOGE) Payment for Tesla, Is DOGE Integration Imminent for X too? - Benzinga

Elon Musk has strongly supported DOGE for several years, dating back to his first tweet about the token in 2019. Since then, Musk has made multiple moves to incorporate DOGE into his various business ventures. Most recently, he has enabled DOGE as a form of payment for Tesla merchandise and is securing payment licenses for his social media platform, X. These moves signal that Musk is intent on providing DOGE payments on X, which could have a huge impact on the cryptocurrency industry. Don't Miss:In early May 2024, Musk and Tesla quietly enabled DOGE payments on the Tesla website. The new feature came after Musk visited the Berlin gigafactory, where he was asked about enabling DOGE payments. "We should enable that," Musk responded. Tesla customers can now send DOGE to the Tesla wallet in exchange for merchandise. Though Tesla did not formally announce the change, DOGE enthusiasts were quick to spot it and the price of DOGE rallied more than 20% in the following days. Additionally, Musk and X have been acquiring payment licenses in U.S. states. At the time of this report, they hold 25 licenses, and the count is growing monthly. These licenses are necessary for enabling peer-to-peer (P2P) payments, similar to how Venmo and Cash App operate. Also, an interesting anecdote from Musk's biography notes that he had dreamed of offering DOGE as a form of payment on a social media platform long before he even acquired X. So, the money transmitter licenses could indicate that the X team is moving closer toward DOGE payments on the platform.This idea was furthered by a retweet from Musk that had a picture of the old X.com logo next to the current X.com logo with the caption "The Everything App." The post was originally tweeted by a DogeDesigner on X. The account says that they work for DOGE, doing UX/UI design. Musk commented on the retweet saying, "The circle will be complete." The post currently has over 65 million views and 126,000 likes. The old X.com was a banking and payment website in the early 2000s that Musk founded. The company merged with Confinity to form PayPal, where Musk served a short stint as CEO. Flash forward to 2024, and Musk is hoping to complete the circle by bringing back the payment aspect of the original X.com. So, the signs point toward Musk wanting to offer DOGE as a form of peer-to-peer payment on the X platform. However, different regulatory hurdles could make this somewhat challenging. Acquiring the payment licenses is a very tedious and slow process. However, Musk seems determined to bring payments to the app and move closer to the "everything app" that he has envisioned for years. Read Next:

								Ripple has run into problems once again with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) following the announcement of its highly anticipated stablecoin. The stablecoin, which is to be pegged to the US dollar, is expected to give established stablecoins such as Tether’s USDT and Circle’s USDC a run for their money. However, the SEC is less than pleased with this launch, going after Ripple before it even launches.
SEC Says New Stablecoin Qualifies As Securities Offering
In April 2024, Ripple announced that it is launching its very own stablecoin that will be pegged to the US dollar. This stablecoin launch came as part of the company’s continuous expansion worldwide, as it continues to spread its wings in the payments sector.
CEO Brad Garlinghouse had revealed that the company’s reasoning behind the launch was to help combat the de-pegging events in stablecoins through the years that have cost crypto investors billions. While this sounds like a noble endeavor, the US SEC is less than pleased.
According to the regulator, the stablecoin which Ripple plans to launch qualifies as an unregistered crypto asset. This was made known in a redacted brief filed by the SEC in the ongoing legal battle with the crypto firm.
The regulator’s most recent allegations tie back into its claims that XRP, which was launched in 2012, qualifies as an unregistered security offering. The SEC argues that Ripple has built its business on offering unregistered securities to investors, and its latest stablecoin project falls under that umbrella as well.
“Ripple’s primary business continues to be, as it has been since 2013, unregistered sales of XRP. It also plans to issue a new unregistered crypto asset,” the filing read. Given this, it seems the regulator is trying to stop Ripple ahead of launch, which is scheduled to happen toward the end of 2024.
The State Of Ripple’s Lawsuit
Even though Ripple has been able to secure a number of partial victories against the SEC in the last year, such as Judge Analisa Torres ruling that secondary programmatic sales did not qualify as a securities offering, its battle with the regulator is far from over.
A settlement is expected between both parties, but even that is proving to be a challenge. The SEC is demanding a $2 billion fine to be levied against the crypto firm as an appropriate amount for the ‘violations.’ However, Ripple has fired back against this, offering only $10 million, which the regulator has called a “slap on the wrist”.
Both parties are currently in the remedies stage, filing their briefs along with their supporting exhibits. Given this, Ripple CLO Stuart Alderoty believes that the almost 4-year long battle is coming to an end. “The good news is that we are closer than ever to putting this lawsuit behind us,” Alderoty stated in an X (formerly Twitter) post.

                        The tokenization of real-world assets (RWAs) may be the next “killer use case” for the crypto industry.Investment bank Citi released a report in March 2023 showing that the market for RWAs is projected to reach $4 trillion to $5 trillion by the year 2030. The report notes that the potential for tokenization via blockchain is transformative, yet the technology is still not at the point of mass adoption. While this may be the case, industry experts believe that artificial intelligence (AI) solutions could push tokenized RWA use cases forward.
Understanding Tokenized RWAs
RWA tokenization has been a long-time concept and dates back to 2018 when security token offerings (STOs) were all the rage. Fortunately, today’s tokenized RWAs differ from previously seen STOs, which were largely unregulated.Dave Hendricks, CEO and Co-founder of Vertalo, told Cryptonews that RWAs now have a degree of tangibility.“If a custodian can’t hold on to the asset legally, and if it’s not considered a high-quality liquid asset by banks for international settlements, then some might not even consider that an RWA asset in the traditional sense,” explained Hendricks.Hendricks added that Vertalo – a digital transfer agent and enterprise software platform – has been tokenizing RWAs since 2018. According to Hendricks, tokenization use cases are an important part of the decentralized finance (DeFi) ecosystem.He noted that use cases like stablecoins differ from tokenizing valuable and scarce assets like art, diamonds, or real estate.“Assets like art, diamonds or even real estate can now be fractionalized via tokenization,” said Hendricks. “Investors can now own part of that asset and receive income from the lease or use of the asset. When you tokenize an asset, each token represents a percentage of the asset.”
Benefits of Tokenized RWAs
While Hendricks pointed out that tokenizing RWAs makes assets more easily tradable, he noted that a tangible benefit of tokenized RWAs lies in their transparency and mid/back-office applications within the traditional asset management function.“This is why we are now seeing large financial institutions looking at improving asset management functions using distributed ledger technology,” he said.This appears to be the case, as the world’s largest asset manager, Blackrock, recently led a $47 million funding round for Securitize. The company focuses on bringing physical and traditional financial assets onto the blockchain.Payments giant Mastercard also announced on Wednesday that it will test new distributed ledger technology to enable tokenized asset settlement between its entities. In a May 8 statement, Mastercard said the project is focused on increasing the efficiency of cross-border settlements and reducing the chance of error and fraud.
How AI Can Help Tokenized RWA Use Cases
While it’s notable that the tokenization of RWAs is gaining traction, industry experts believe that AI will help advance use cases.Meysam Alizadeh, Senior Researcher at the Digital Democracy Lab at University of Zurich and CEO of Coinfident, told Cryptonews that AI can help with RWA token trades.For example, Alizadeh mentioned that AI can enable asset value prediction.“Imagine a venture capitalist (VC) that manages multiple startups and RWAs and uses them to back a token,” said Alizadeh. “In this case, given the availability of a VC’s portfolio, AI can be used to predict the future values of its assets and RWAs of its startups, or to predict demand for their services.”Alizadeh added that this can help traders have a better understanding of the future valuation of a VC’s portfolio.“This could result in a better valuation of its RWA token,” he said.
Using AI for Predictive Pricing of RWAs
To put this in perspective, Jacques Voorhees – CEO and Founder of tokenization platform RealCap – told Cryptonews that RealCap would soon be using AI to help determine the price of RWAs.Voorhees explained that RealCap initially began tokenizing diamonds but noted that the platform now helps tokenize rare artwork and other unique assets.“When we started with diamonds, we didn’t need to use AI for price predictions,” said Voorhees. “But once RealCap began tokenizing RWAs with less available pricing information, we realized we needed an AI solution to help determine prices.”Voorhees elaborated that RealCap recently created a technology called “virtual fungibility,” allowing tokenized RWAs to be more tradable with reduced price discrepancies.Yet he noted that virtual fungibility requires AI to determine the price of certain RWAs.“Let’s say an investor wants to buy art,” he said. “They can go online to different galleries, but an investor still may not know what the best price is for a piece of art. You need an objective measure. AI can help with predicative prices of each piece of art in this instance.”RealCap is currently building and developing its AI solution to ensure predictive pricing.
Using AI To Streamline RWA Workflows 
Alizadeh further noted that AI could be applied to automate RWA workflow analysis.“One of the risks of RWA tokenization is smart contract bugs and vulnerabilities,” he said. “AI can help in two ways here – the technology can help to create reliable smart contracts, to streamline contract reviews and to detect potential bugs and compliance issues.”Natalia Karayaneva, CEO and Founder of Propy, told Cryptonews that Propy is using AI for this particular case.Propy has been tokenizing real estate since 2018 and has conducted over $4 billion in transactions across the United States. According to Karayaneva, Propy recently began using AI to streamline transaction timelines automatically.“Propy AI can read purchase agreements, create transaction trackers, and settle intelligent deadlines for deposits, loan approvals, and more,” said Karayaneva. “This level of automation ensures a smoother, secure, and more transparent property investment process, which is crucial as we integrate more into tokenized markets.”Alizadeh elaborated that AI is being applied for customer risk analysis for platforms like Propy and other tokenized RWA lending outlets.“AI can be used to evaluate the credibility of the borrower, taking into consideration the borrower’s past on-chain transactions and activities,” he said. “This is similar to the credit scoring system in the US, which banks use to evaluate the risk of the customers.”
Challenges Associated with Tokenized RWAs and AI
While AI will likely advance tokenized RWA use cases, Alizadeh warned that challenges may hamper adoption.For instance, he pointed out that data around the AI applications mentioned may not be easily accessible.“AI needs data to work, and limited data access decreases AI usability,” he said.Alizadeh further remarked that decentralized exchange users may not be required to undergo Know Your Customer (KYC) procedures. This may result in a lack of information about a user’s demographic and location, impacting a customer risk assessment AI model.“Another data access challenge is getting all on-chain transactions of a user,” added Alizadeh. “Since everyone can hold multiple wallets and the identity of wallet holders is not easily verifiable, it’s not easy to get all on-chain transaction history of a crypto user. Most of the solutions to these challenges may be in conflict with users’ privacy and need more research to overcome.”
Tokenization Challenges Beyond AI
AI aside, Alizadeh believes that the primary challenges associated with tokenized RWAs are regulatory issues and asset verification.“Tokenizing an asset, such as a building, could turn them into securities, potentially attracting strict regulatory scrutiny,” Alizadeh mentioned. “This would likely decrease the incentives of RWA tokens.”He added that the verifiable authenticity of the assets underpinning RWA tokens remains problematic.“Crypto traders often express skepticism about the validity of claims concerning a token’s real-world backing asset,” he remarked.With these challenges in mind, Hendricks explained that tokenized RWAs must be carefully structured to be successful.For example, he noted that most tokenized RWAs in DeFi are debt or loan instruments.“Many if not most RWA offerings are just loans where investors put in collateral and get paid back an interest rate,” Hendricks said. “This is very lightly regulated and anyone can participate in this model. However, there may be recourse if collateral is lost and value declines.”Hendricks added that a security can be created from a tokenized RWA if the underlying asset has a secured interest.“For example, if a startup is raising money to buy an asset and fractionalize it under Reg D requirements, it can generally be sold to accredited investors,” he said. “You would then have to go through KYC and AML procedures, which would create a significant speed bump. RWA by itself doesn’t solve this, unfortunately.”

Espresso and Polygon Labs partner to address rollup interoperability - Crypto Briefing




Espresso Systems, a shared sequencer developer, has partnered with Polygon Labs, an Ethereum layer-2 scaling solution. The collaboration is meant to build out and produce an aggregation layer (AggLayer) that could solve the problem of fragmented liquidity across interoperable rollups.AggLayer, first introduced in January, is designed to enable transaction verification across multiple chains using a process called “proof aggregation.” This ensures that transactions across its ecosystems are valid without relying on third-party bridging solutions. Documentation from Polygon Labs state that all transactions will be guaranteed on AggLayer, providing a seamless experience for users.“Blockchains today don’t look or feel like the Internet. Instead of a unified, highly scalable network, users face scaling limitations and bad UX due to fragmented liquidity and state,” Polygon Labs said.The Espresso Shared Sequencer is a decentralized system that serves as a sequencer and data availability point to connect a variety of L2s. With such an infrastructure, the credibility, interoperability, and alignment with Ethereum, are enhanced to better achieve autonomy, neutrality, and collaboration among EVM chains.“Our respective teams have been thinking deeply about layer-2 interoperability over the last year — it’s amazing to see our solutions converge in such a synergistic way,” Espresso Labs CEO Ben Fisch said in an interview.Other projects such as Nil Foundation are also building out either modular or integrated approaches to solving scalability in Ethereum. For comparison, projects such as zkSync are pursuing “vertical” scaling, while Nil Foundation is building on “horizontal” scaling with the idea of embedding the sequencer to a protocol to enable transactions across different shards.Espresso has received significant funding in the past, including $28 million in a Series B round led by a16z crypto. Notably, Espresso serves as a marketplace for shared sequencing, allowing rollups to auction the rights to build their blocks. This market enables rollups to offer sequencing timeslots to shared sequencers through an auction. Espresso, on this end, will act as the coordinator that unifies the interdependent rollups prior to settlement on Ethereum.

FTX Bankruptcy: Fallen Exchange To Amass up to $5,100,000,000 More Than What Users Lost at Time of Collapse - The Daily Hodl


								The bankrupt crypto exchange FTX now has holdings worth billions of dollars more than the legally approved claims made by its creditors.
A recently filed disclosure statement indicates that FTX’s bankruptcy estate estimates it will hold net distributable proceeds between $14.5 billion and $16.3 billion on September 30th, the projected start date for the exchange’s reorganization plan.










FTX only owes creditors approximately $11.2 billion, putting the bankrupt exchange’s creditors in a position to recover between 118% and 142% of their claim values, according to the disclosure statement.
However, FTX’s creditors’ digital asset claims are denominated in dollars and based on the near-bottom crypto prices at the time of the disgraced exchange’s collapse in November 2022. Crypto prices had cratered at the time due to the FTX turmoil and the related contagion spreading throughout the sector.
Bitcoin (BTC), for example, was trading at around $16,600 on November 14th, 2022, compared to $61,435 at time of writing. Ethereum (ETH) was trading at around $1,250, compared to $2,969, currently.
The increased dollar payouts for FTX creditors are thanks to the soaring crypto prices this year and the exchange’s sale of a stake in the AI (artificial intelligence) safety and research company Anthropic.
Disgraced FTX founder Sam Bankman-Fried was found guilty late last year of defrauding investors and mishandling billions of dollars worth of customer funds related to the multi-billion-dollar downfall of the exchange in 2022.
On March 28th, Judge Lewis A. Kaplan sentenced Bankman-Fried to 25 years in prison and three years of supervised release. He also ordered the 32-year-old to pay $11 billion in forfeiture. Bankman-Fried is appealing his conviction and sentence.

Binance Financial Penalty In Canada Is $4.3 Million For Unregistered Operations - Coincu



	

Key Points:




Canadian regulators fined Binance $4.3 million for failure to register as a foreign money services business and report large cryptocurrency transactions.



The Binance financial penalty comes amidst a series of legal challenges for Binance, including a $4.3 billion fine in the U.S. and former CEO Changpeng Zhao’s prison sentence.



Binance faces regulatory scrutiny globally and has ceased operations in Canada, with ongoing legal battles in Nigeria over money laundering allegations.




Canadian regulators imposed a C$6 million ($4.3 million) fine on Binance, the world’s largest cryptocurrency exchange, alleging two separate violations of financial regulations.





Binance Financial Penalty In Canada Comes With Other Challenges



According to the Financial Transactions and Reports Analysis Centre of Canada (FINTRAC), Binance failed to register as a foreign money services business despite multiple opportunities and neglected to report virtual currency transactions exceeding C$10,000. Between June 2021 and July 2023, Binance allegedly failed to report 5,902 crypto transactions over $10,000, along with their associated know-your-customer (KYC) information.



These violations were discovered using blockchain explorer tools. This Binance financial penalty closely follows its agreement to pay U.S. regulators a $4.3 billion fine for violating anti-money laundering laws and former CEO Changpeng “CZ” Zhao‘s four-month U.S. prison sentence for inadequate KYC/AML measures.



Binance Battles Regulatory Challenges Worldwide



Last year, Binance ceased operations in Canada, citing regulatory challenges. The exchange faces scrutiny from various regulators worldwide, including the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Binance previously pleaded guilty to violating U.S. anti-money laundering laws and agreed to pay a hefty fine. Additionally, Binance is embroiled in legal battles in Nigeria, where it faces accusations of money laundering and tax evasion.




The Binance financial penalty by FINTRAC is part of Canada‘s efforts to enforce financial regulations. Notably, Toronto-Dominion Bank recently faced a C$9.19 million penalty for compliance failings related to monitoring and reporting suspected money laundering and terrorist financing.



Under Canada’s Proceeds of Crime and Terrorist Financing Act, administrative penalties aim to encourage businesses to improve compliance rather than punitive measures.

                        In the latest Solana meme coin skyrocket, a new Apple-themed token has exploded 76,928% overnight following Apple’s new product launches.This article will provide an analysis of APPLE’s current price trends and look to see whether an innovative new meme coin, Dogeverse, represents a more promising investment opportunity at this time.The APPLE meme coin’s price has exploded amid the sensational launch of the latest iPad model, which has gone viral after its launch advert ‘CRUSH’ was met with a poor reception amongst consumers.It is worth mentioning that the meme coin, indeed, has no official affiliation with Apple the company in any capacity.Thus is the nature of the decentralized meme coin markets.
APPLE Price Analysis: As New Solana Meme Coin APPLE Surges – Is Skyrocket Heading for the Moon?
As price action continues to hammer to the upside, APPLE is currently trading at a market price of $0.00123 (representing a 24-hour change of +76,926%).This is a jaw-dropping move, as price action has sustained a major upside rallying structure for 16 hours after leaping out of rock-bottom support around 1 AM UTC on May 9.Constant pressure from $116k in retail investor volume has propelled APPLE to fire up in a skyrocket that has so far topped out around $0.00125.Now standing at a market cap of $1.22M, it seems likely that APPLE will continue to sustain upside moves.Although, it is worth noting that there is no way of telling whether the market is being manipulated or whether even the token is a honeypot scam being pushed higher by bots and insiders.For that reason, some concern emerges that such a rally could result in a thunderous dump which is why smart money investors are chasing more reliable Solana meme coin returns in an emerging project that has secured a whopping $13M in presale funding.Indeed, there is growing concern that such a dramatic rally might lead to a significant market correction.This has prompted savvy investors to seek more reliable returns in the meme coin space, particularly in an emerging project that has already secured an impressive $13 million in presale funding.
Next To Pump: Dogeverse – Over $13M Raised in Viral Meme Coin PresaleWhile Dogecoin price basks in the afterglow of fleeting Tesla support, the Dogeverse presale continues to gain traction. The latest presale statistics show that the project has raised over $13 million. Going by recent trends, this could just be the beginning of this upswing.Dogeverse offers better features than Dogecoin.Most importantly, it is the first multichain meme coin and will deploy on Ethereum, BNB Chain, Polygon, Solana, Avalanche, and Base, among other platforms.Moreover, Dogeverse, unlike Dogecoin, supports staking, meaning presale investors can diversify income streams from passive gains and decent DOGEVERSE yields.Buy DOGEVERSE Here

What Is Fantasy Top? The Ethereum Game on Blast Turning Crypto Twitter Into a Fantasy Sport - Decrypt

We’ve seen mash-ups of fantasy sports and NFT trading cards, but what about something with more crypto-native subject matter? Enter Fantasy Top.Built on Ethereum layer-2 network Blast, Fantasy Top takes the premise of fantasy football and other fantasy sports games, but swaps out pro athletes for crypto influencers. It’s like Crypto Twitter: The Game, and it’s more than just a surface-level riff on the social media sphere.Fantasy Top has gotten off to an electric start, dominating industry chatter while driving surging trading volume—and becoming one of the most profitable protocols or apps across all of crypto. Curious how to get started? Here’s what you need to know.What is Fantasy Top?Crypto Twitter often feels like a spectator sport, so it makes sense that someone turned it into a fantasy game. Fantasy Top takes the core premise of fantasy football, soccer, or baseball, and swaps in 120 (and counting) crypto influencers, traders, content creators, and personalities.Each “hero” in the game is based on a denizen of Crypto Twitter, and they get their own NFT cards minted on Ethereum layer-2 network Blast. You can buy and trade the NFTs, which come in multiple rarity levels and can be upgraded by acquiring multiple copies of a lower-level edition and trading them up. Higher-level cards come with a larger score multiplier.In Fantasy Top competitions, you’ll select a lineup of five owned NFT cards and lock it in. Scoring is based on the actual Twitter engagement of your industry “heroes,” amplified by your cards’ particular score multipliers, so there’s strategy involved in both buying up cards for your lineup and picking the best cross-section of crypto tweeters to place highly in a competition.Cards in Fantasy Top. Image: Fantasy TopRewards thus far include Ethereum (ETH), Blast Gold points that will go towards the network’s upcoming BLAST token drop, and FAN points, which may ultimately lead to future benefits on Fantasy Top—or perhaps an allotment of airdrop tokens.Do I need NFTs to play Fantasy Top?Yes, Fantasy Top requires NFT cards to play. You’ll need at least five to lock in a lineup for a competition, and at this point, there’s no option to play the game without the NFTs.Fantasy Top sells packs of cards with dynamic pricing based on demand (currently around 0.4 ETH, or nearly $1,200), or you can purchase individual cards from the app’s NFT marketplace.Fantasy Top is played via the website, and like with other fantasy sports, you simply set your lineup and then watch the points roll in. Your leaderboard placement at the end of each competition period determines your rewards.What can I win in Fantasy Top?With such significant demand right out the gate, the early rewards are substantial indeed. In the first “main competition,” Fantasy Top served up a total prize pool that included over $150,000 worth of ETH, potentially more than $2 million worth of Blast Gold (based on analyst projections), and other perks to players.And the crypto influencers who've become in-game heroes are seeing sizable benefits, too. A share of the overall pack sales, along with a cut of the marketplace fees, are paid out to the influencers.Less than a week after Fantasy Top’s mainnet launch on May 1, 2024, the game paid out $1.25 million worth of ETH (in total) to heroes, along with what’s estimated to be at least $25,000 worth of Blast Gold points.The futureFantasy Top is early and buzzy, but the team has already teased plans ahead for the future—and it also clearly has some kinks to work out along the way.One week after launch, the game has already added leagues, which split players up into Silver and Bronze categories based on their performance thus far. Rewards will apparently vary by league designation, with “rewards increasingly skewed towards the top performers,” according to a tweet.What’s ahead? More in-game heroes, apparently, along with an improved scoring model, a “whole array of sub-competitions,” and other “surprises” to come.But as Fantasy Top attempts to grow, it will also need to deal with the immediate problem of users (or external observers) “botting” tweets from the heroes, manipulating the scoring and leading to some early pivots as the team figures out how to handle it all.Some heroes have complained of being targeted by botters, and Fantasy Top already decided to end its first main competition early due to manipulation concerns. The game is built around social media engagement, so that’s something they’ll have to sort out if Fantasy Top is going to try and parlay this early buzz into a sustainable game model.Stay on top of crypto news, get daily updates in your inbox.

Stocks Rebound As Rising Jobless Claims Sustain Rate-Cut Hopes, Dollar Falls, Gold Rallies: What's Driving Markets Thursday? - Airbnb (NASDAQ:ABNB) - Benzinga

Wall Street is seeing a day of gains as all major indices traded in the green around noon in New York, driven by a surprising uptick in unemployment claims prompting speculation over Federal Reserve interest rate cuts.Jobless benefits rose from 209,000 to 231,000 in the week ending May 4, surpassing market expectations of 210,000 and reaching the highest level in eight months. Consequently, the U.S. dollar Index (DXY), tracked by the Invesco DB USD Index Bullish Fund ETF UUP, declined by 0.2% in reaction to the data, as market participants slightly increased bets on a September Fed cut. The S&P 500 index inched up by 0.1%, following Wednesday’s flat close, while blue chips of the Dow Jones Industrial Average climbed 0.4%, aiming for their seventh consecutive day of gains, the longest streak since December 2023. Small caps, tracked by the iShares Russell 2000 ETF IWM, increased by 0.5%. Gold surged by 1% and silver by 2.8% due to the lower dollar. Bitcoin BTC/USD saw a 1.4% increase.Elsewhere, the Bank of England kept interest rates unchanged, while flagging rising chances of imminent rate cuts as new inflation projections reveal that price pressures will fall below target in two years.

Bitcoin Surges Past $64,000 as Market Liquidity Swings; U.S. and Hong Kong ETFs See Bullish Inflows



                    

Bitcoin (BTC) saw a resurgence above the $64,000 mark on May 7 as it experienced significant liquidity on both sides of the order book.



This upward movement was identified from data provided by Cointelegraph Markets Pro and TradingView, which showed BTC escalating from a low of $62,864 at Bitstamp earlier in the day. 




The currency remained within a trading range that had been established since May 3. Despite this, the price fluctuations were rapid, creating a volatile environment that led to the liquidation of positions in both directions.



The late trading hours saw a focus on bid liquidity near $63,500 before Bitcoin reversed direction, targeting a more substantial liquidity pool roughly $1,000 higher, as per the data from CoinGlass.



Daan Crypto Trades, a recognized trader, commented on the behavior seen over the weekend, specifically the closure of the CME futures gap. 




“Took some hours after the futures re-open but got there on Monday which is something we tend to see quite often,” he mentioned, discussing the patterns observed.



Another trader, Skew, pointed out several crucial levels that should be monitored going forward. 



He noted, “Price currently still chopping around $64K,” in his latest market analysis, adding the importance of trading the monthly open and $61K as significant demand markers in the market, with a high timeframe pivot at $67K.



The recovery from recent two-month lows around $58,000 also marked a notable divergence from the 2021 bull market trend, when Bitcoin first reached similar levels.

This difference was attributed to strong spot buyer demand, as emphasized by Skew.



Regarding the ETF market, the narrative around U.S. and Hong Kong Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) turned bullish. 



On May 6, the day before the price surge, U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs, including the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC), witnessed substantial inflows. 



Data from Farside, a UK-based investment firm, revealed positive inflows totaling $217 million across all 10 spot ETFs. 



This influx marked GBTC’s first day of positive inflows since its conversion to an ETF.



The stability of inflows into the newly launched Hong Kong spot ETFs was also highlighted, with “very stable volume-wise with consistent $8-9 million,” as noted by popular commentator WhalePanda. 



He further added, “As long as inflows stays positive here the supply is getting scooped up so overall quite bullish.”

Bitcoin Price Struggles to Stay Above $62,000 despite Positive European Equity Rally



This ongoing Bitcoin volatility has forced Bitwise, an asset manage­ment firm, to advise caution, suggesting the­ halving event might have be­en a “sell the ne­ws” scenario. 

The cryptocurre­ncy market continues to defy e­xpectations. While European stocks surge­ to record highs, Bitcoin remains stubbornly stuck below the­ $62,000 mark. This comes despite the­ Bank of England (BoE) hinting at a potential summer rate cut, a move­ traditionally seen as positive for riskie­r assets like Bitcoin.
The major Europe­an and UK stock markets experie­nced a positive day on Thursday. London’s FTSE 100 reache­d a new all-time high, closing at 8,393 after a 22-point gain. The­ broader European Stoxx 600 index also had a positive­ day, rising 0.15% to 516.




This optimistic sentiment in traditional markets stands in stark contrast to the­ ongoing struggles of Bitcoin. The world’s most popular cryptocurrency has be­en unable to capitalize on the­ positive sentiments, hovering above the $62,000 mark.
BoE Interest Rate Impact on Bitcoin
The Bank of England opted to maintain interest rates at their current level of 5.25% for the sixth consecutive meeting. This “wait-and-see” approach reflects the central bank’s cautious stance on inflation. However, Governor Andrew Bailey offered a glimmer of hope, suggesting a rate cut as soon as next month if inflation falls in line with their forecasts.
“We’ve had encouraging news on inflation and we think it will fall close to our 2% target in the next couple of months,” Bailey said. “While we need more evidence of sustained low inflation before a rate cut, I’m optimistic things are moving in the right direction.”
Despite the prospect of a summer rate cut, analyst Myron Jobson of Interactive Investor tempers expectations. He emphasizes that a broader environment of higher-for-longer interest rates is unlikely to disappear anytime soon.
“Interest rates could remain higher for the next decade than they were in the decade after the 2008 financial crisis,” said Jobson. This could dampen the appeal of Bitcoin, which has historically thrived in low-interest-rate environments.
Bitcoin’s Post-Halving Volatility Persists
The Bitcoin halving e­vent, which ended on April 20th, cut the­ block mining reward by half. These halving e­vents have often le­d to significant price rises. For example­, the 2012 halving saw a 9,500% price increase­, and the 2016 event re­sulted in a 3,000% jump the following year. Howe­ver, the 2020 post-halving rally was more mode­st, with Bitcoin appreciating by 650%.
Before the­ recent halving, Bitcoin expe­rienced a volatile 110% price­ increase. The we­ek leading up to the e­vent saw a sharp 17% dip from $72,000 to $60,000. Contrary to expectations, the­ post-halving rally has not materialized. Bitcoin briefly re­ached $67,000 on April 24th but quickly fell back to $62,500 within three­ days.
This ongoing volatility has forced Bitwise, an asset manage­ment firm, to advise caution, suggesting the­ halving event might have be­en a “sell the ne­ws” scenario. Analysts from JPMorgan and Deutsche Bank share­ this view, projecting that Bitcoin could drop as low as $42,000 in the coming we­eks.

AI Coins represent one of crypto's fastest growing sectors
                        Many crypto tokens attached to top AI/blockchain projects are rallying hard ahead of Nvidia’s earnings report on May 22.Nvidia is the premier AI play in the stock market.The stock has an eye-watering market capitalization of $2.2 trillion and some of the highest returns of any asset.For comparison, Bitcoin pulls up most of the $2.37 trillion crypto market with a capitalization of $1.2 trillion.Nvidia’s stock is down 2% today, roughly in line with both Bitcoin and Ethereum’s ($ETH) depreciation over the last 24 hours. However, while Nvidia has only moved about 4% in the last month, several AI coins have exploded in the last seven days.Most of the top ten AI-related cryptocurrencies rallied by double-digit percentages over the past week.The $4.1 billion market cap Render ($RNDR) leaped nearly 40% to trade at $10.68.The only token in the sector that matched its performance was AIOZ Network ($AIOZ), which rose 35% to $0.8402.Multiple leading AI coins rallied between 20-30% this week. They include Arkham ($ARKM), Golem ($GLM), and Akash Network ($AKT).Other top ten AI cryptocurrencies posted intraweek gains of 10%: the $5.5 billion market cap sector leader Fetch.AI ($FET), alongside Ocean Protocol ($OCEAN), SingularityNET ($AGIX), and The Graph ($GTR). Worldcoin ($WLD) also had a good week. Although not an AI coin as such, the token—which hopes to bank the planet’s legions of unbanked by scanning their eyeballs, confirming and storing the data and giving crypto in return—is by Sam Altman.He’s also the CEO of OpenAI, the progenitor of the massively popular ChatGPT, so $WLD can be thought of as a proxy for OpenAI too.WLD rose 18% this week.

Binance Co-Founder Yi He Responded to WSJ Claims! - Bitcoin Sistemi

In today's news, WSJ claimed that Binance detected that popular market maker DWF Labs was engaged in market manipulation.
Based on the statements of a former Binance employee, WSJ claimed that Binance researchers manipulated the prices of DWF Labs' Yield Guild Game (YGG) token and at least six altcoins in 2023.



While DWF Labs X denied WSJ's claims, a Binance spokesperson also denied the news and told Cointelegraph:

“Binance categorically denies any allegation that its market surveillance program allows market manipulation on our platform. We have a robust market surveillance framework that detects and takes action against market abuse. Any users who violate our terms of use will be excluded; we do not tolerate market abuse .”

Sarcastic Thanks to WSJ from Binance Co-Founder Yi He!
A reaction to WSJ's manipulation allegations came from Binance co-founder Yi He. Yi He, who denied the allegations from the X account and stated that they had no privileged actions against any fund, said the following:






“We monitor market makers closely. We do not target any fund or market maker. However, there is great competition among market makers and there is a lot of fraudulent behavior.
Anyone who wants can pay money to advertise, but don't bother with me.
“We will ensure our own fairness and will not participate in such games, and will continue to report honestly to auditors and other regulatory authorities.”

Yi He made another statement after this post.
Stating that WSJ has consistently targeted Binance, Yi He said, “I would like to thank WSJ for its long-term investment in Binance. Because WSJ has been consistently reporting about us for a long time. “I am grateful to them for saving us their budget. However, while reporting this kind of news, WSJ did not report that Binance was assisting law enforcement and assisting in the arrest of Zkasino's main culprit. This shows that WSJ acted with bias.” said.

Bitcoin About To ‘Blow Higher’ Despite This Week’s Pullback, According to Glassnode Co-Founders - Here’s Why - The Daily Hodl


								The founders of crypto analytics platform Glassnode are predicting that Bitcoin (BTC) will soon soar even higher after being up 7% in the last week.
In a new thread, the co-founders of Glassnode, who go by the handle Negentropic on the social media platform X, tell their 62,900 followers that key indicators suggest Bitcoin is gearing up from a massive breakout.










The analysts say Bitcoin appears to be forming a bullish pennant pattern. They also suggest that Bitcoin is correcting to a Fibonacci retracement level, in the low $60,000 range, which often predicts a continuation of an upward trend.
“BTC still looks like it is about to blow higher! Last week’s candle was a reversal candle – a hammer with a long wick. Price moved back into the pennant structure. This candle still dominates the structure. This week’s pullback, hence, seems like a healthy correction before higher. Corrections often pull back either 50% or 61.8% of the previous impulse move.”
Source: Negentropic/X
Looking at their chart, the analysts suggest that Bitcoin has or is about to complete a three-wave ABC correction. The Elliott Wave theory states that a bullish asset often witnesses a fresh leg up after an ABC correction of three wave impulses.
The analysts believe Bitcoin could break through the $85,000 level before the start of summer, which officially begins on June 20th.
“BTC is currently in the process of breaking the trendline of pennant and the 50-day SMA (simple moving average). When the level of $65,000-$66,000 is broken, BTC will move on to first $73,500, then $76,500, and chances are that we see $85,200 before the summer.” 
Bitcoin is trading for $62,016 at time of writing, down slightly in the last 24 hours.

New Shibarium Node Validator K9 Unfolds 420M KNINE Giveaway - DailyCoin


        
Freshly-appointed Shibarium validator K9 launches 420M KNINE contest.



The sweepstakes will run for two weeks, ending at 3 PM EST on May 22, 2024.



SHIB consolidated at $0.000022 as most altcoins pulled back on Thursday.
Shiba Inu’s (SHIB) upcoming Liquid Staking Derivatives (LSD) platform on Shibarium Layer-2 has awakened the curiosity of Shiba Inu custodians. K9 Finance DAO, the decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) behind the dynamic staking platform, launched a contest with 420M KNINE tokens up for grabs in the prize pool.The sweepstakes is being held in celebration of K9 Finance DAO becoming a node validator on Shibarium L2. This adds an extra layer of security to SHIB’s own blockchain after the hard fork in early May 2024. Moreover, the close partnership with SHIB Token lets K9 Finance DAO work on bolstering Shibarium’s liquidity by bringing unprecedented functionality to the chain.How to Get Your Hands on 420M KNINE Prize PoolCryptocurrency aficionados should head to TaskOn, where they can find a task list of mandatory and optional activities. In order to participate, SHIB Army members can log in to TaskOn in multiple ways, including Web3 and social media gateways. 
Shibarians can choose from X, Telegram, Discord, or email as an authentication method, while MetaMask, Bitget Wallet, Wallet Connect, and TronLink are the options for authentication via Web3. Once logged on, crypto enthusiasts are presented with two mandatory tasks.The first task revolves around swapping at least $100 of ETH to KNINE on UniSwap v3; the buying action follows the social task to quote a tweet, including the hashtags #K9Finance and #buycontest on Twitter. As the sweepstakes are run on raffle-based entries, the chances can be improved by doing optional tasks on the contest page.
These include following the campaign’s host, K9 Finance DAO, on Telegram and Twitter. Users can complete the smaller tasks worth five entries by following the SHARBI token, ChewySwap, Bad Idea AI, WoofSwap, CoinMerge, and other Shibarium-related products to gather all possible points.What K9 DAO’s Staking App Brings to ShibariumK9 Finance DAO serves the same purpose as Lido Protocol on Ether (ETH). When Lido entered the largest Proof of Stake (PoS) network, blockchain aficionados could diversify their digital asset staking portfolios across different smart contracts, magnifying the potential returns. K9 Finance DAO’s core product, BONE Crusher, is set to employ Shibarium’s Bone ShibaSwap (BONE) in a dual token system. Once Shibarium L2 users delegate their BONE to the BONE Crusher decentralized application (dApp), they get an equivalent of knBONE, the in-app version of Shibarium’s gas fee token.While the liquid yield project aims to bolster Shibarium’s on-chain liquidity, the participants can collect their staking rewards in both KNINE and BONE. Set for a Q3 of 2024 launch, the BONE Crusher dApp will run on Shibarium L2 and employ a bi-folded LSD system that rewards both the SHIB Army and K9 Army for participation in staking activities.On the Flipside
Two months into launch, K9 Finance DAO’s KNINE token backtracked 89% from its all-time high of $0.0003468, which was reached on March 10, 2024.



With a global market capitalization of $4,111,158, KNINE can be traded on MEXC, BitMart, and decentralized crypto waters.
Why This MattersSHIB Token’s leading team members have joined K9 Finance DAO’s advisory board, acclaiming the forthcoming liquid staking project as an official component of the Shibarium Ecosystem.Check Out DailyCoin’s popular crypto stories:“Crypto Is a Garden of Snakes:” Rep Sherman Backs SEC ActionFTX Pens Plan Promising 118% Cash Back to Creditors

ETH Founder Buterin Charts New Territory with Ethereum Gas Pricing Overhaul - Coin Edition


							

Multidimensional gas pricing enhances Ethereum’s scalability by decoupling resources for tailored pricing.
The introduction of “blobs” in Ethereum’s Dencun hard fork showcases the potential of multidimensional gas pricing.
Balancing scalability and security remains a challenge, especially in accommodating stateless clients’ storage proofs.




In Ethereum’s ongoing quest for scalability and efficiency, Vitalik Buterin has recently explored the concept of multidimensional gas pricing in a blog post. Gas, traditionally a singular measure encompassing various computational efforts within the Ethereum network, has been subject to scrutiny due to its limitations in accurately representing different resource constraints.







Buterin highlights the inefficiency stemming from the one-dimensional nature of gas pricing, which fails to account for the distinct safety limits of various network resources. This oversight can lead to either the exclusion of safe blocks or the acceptance of unsafe ones, hindering overall throughput by a substantial margin.



A novel approach introduced in Ethereum Improvement Proposal (EIP)-4844, termed multidimensional gas, has sparked significant interest. This approach decouples resources such as computation, data bandwidth, and storage, allowing for separate pricing mechanisms tailored to each resource’s unique constraints.









The introduction of “blobs” in the Dencun hard fork exemplifies the potential of multidimensional gas pricing. By allocating separate space for rollup-friendly data within blocks, transaction costs on rollups have plummeted, transaction volumes surged, and theoretical block sizes expanded marginally, all while maintaining network safety.



Looking ahead, the impending challenge of accommodating stateless clients necessitates a similar reevaluation of gas pricing. With storage proofs becoming a focal point, the Ethereum community faces the dilemma of balancing scalability with security.



Buterin proposes a paradigm shift towards floating prices for state size-increasing operations, offering a nuanced approach to managing network resources. By setting floating prices to target specific average usage levels, Ethereum could mitigate long-term scalability concerns without imposing rigid per-block limits.



However, implementing multidimensional gas pricing poses technical challenges, particularly concerning gas limits in sub-calls within the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM). While solutions like EIP-7623 offer incremental improvements, achieving a comprehensive multidimensional pricing scheme requires careful consideration of backward compatibility and protocol economics.

Robinhood CEO Speaks After SEC's Wells Reporting! Supported Cryptocurrencies! - Bitcoin Sistemi

As it is known, the SEC recently sent a Wells Notice to the US-based cryptocurrency platform Robinhood.
While the possible effects of the Wells Statement on the crypto market continue to be discussed, a statement came from Robinhood Co-Founder and CEO Vlad Tenev.



Speaking to CNBC, Robinhood CEO made statements about the SEC's latest actions.
Stating that cryptocurrencies are becoming increasingly popular and important, Tenev argued that Americans should have access to cryptocurrencies.





The famous CEO, who thinks that it is unacceptable for Americans not to have access to cryptocurrencies, stated that they met with the SEC 16 times before receiving the Wells Notice.
Vlad Telev said that as a result of these meetings, they learned that Robinhood would face SEC sanctions in the future.



“We tried to create what is called a special purpose broker-dealer for the purpose of trading cryptocurrencies.
And we actually came to meet with the SEC in good faith. I think we met with the SEC 16 times.
However, these talks did not yield any response and we learned that we would face SEC sanctions.
The SEC has the ability to change the rules to allow brokers to trade cryptocurrencies, but it does not appear to have any intention of doing so. Rather, the SEC continues to regulate through enforcement. And that's disappointing.
“I didn't want to be in this situation with the SEC, but we have to defend ourselves and our customers.”

CryptoQuant CEO Predicts Where Bitcoin Price Is Headed, Is $265,000 Too Ambitious?


																Ki Young Ju, CEO of cryptocurrency analysis firm CryptoQuant, has given an ultra-bullish prediction for Bitcoin. The crypto founder alluded to certain factors that could spark the flagship crypto’s rise to such heights. 
Bitcoin Could Rise To As High As $265,000
Young Ju mentioned in an X (formerly Twitter) post that “Bitcoin’s network fundamentals could support a market cap three times its current size compared to the last cyclical top.” He added that this development could help BTC rise to $265,000. The fundamental that the crypto founder was alluding to was the Hashrate/Market Cap ratio.

The accompanying chart that Young Ju shared showed that Bitcoin’s hash rate is currently more than three times what it was at the last market cycle top. Meanwhile, BTC is still at the price level it was during that period. As such, the CryptoQuant CEO believes that Bitcoin could also see a 3x increase in its price, just like the Hash rate. 
Young Ju’s prediction provides a much-needed bullish outlook for Bitcoin, especially given the flagship crypto’s recent decline and talk that Bitcoin may have already attained the market top for this cycle. Tom Lee, co-founder of research firm Fundstrat, also recently shared his bullish sentiment towards BTC, stating that the crypto token will still reach $150,000 this year. 
Meanwhile, similarly to Young Ju’s prediction, crypto analyst MacronautBTC had previously stated that Bitcoin could rise to $237,000. The crypto analyst made this “conservative” calculation based on BTC’s demand outpacing its supply in the long run, especially with the halving further reducing Miners’ supply. 
A Rise To $265,000 Not Ambitious
Young Ju’s prediction of $265,000 for Bitcoin is far from ambitious when considering that Samson Mow, the CEO of JAN3, predicted that Bitcoin could rise to as high as $1 million this year. He explained that this unprecedented rise was possible due to the impressive demand that Bitcoin was currently enjoying. 

Pseudonymous crypto analyst PlanB also echoed a similar sentiment, stating that BTC hitting $1 million is possible, although he suggested that could happen in 2025 rather than this year. He made this prediction based on the Bitcoin stock-to-flow (STF) indicator, which hints at $500,000 being the average price level for Bitcoin in this market cycle. 
As such, the analyst believes that $1 million could be the market top for this bull run. Meanwhile, PlanB mentioned that Bitcoin hitting $100,000 this year was “inevitable.”
At the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading at around $61,700, down over 1% in the last 24 hours, according to data from CoinMarketCap.

Binance co-founder and DWF Labs speak out against market manipulation allegations

Amid new allegations of market manipulation brought by The Wall Street Journal, both Binance co-founder Yi He and market make DWF Labs have denied any involvement. In an X post on May 9, He described the media report as an occurrence that “greatly increased our exposure and saved us a lot of marketing budget.” However, the co-founder denied any of the allegations made against Binance, writing: “I have noticed an interesting phenomenon where some mainstream media articles are increasingly driven by emotions and biases rather than facts. For example, the complaints of former employees can become the basis of an article, while Binance’s proactive assistance to law enforcement agencies in investigating and apprehending the mastermind behind Zkasino (as a matter of fact) is not deemed worthy of reporting.”In a similar post the same day, DWF Labs said the allegations were “unfounded and distort the facts” and that the firm “operates with the highest standards of integrity, transparency, and ethics, and we remain committed to supporting you and our over 700 partners across the crypto ecosystem.” Earlier on May 9, a Wall Street Journal report claimed that DWF Labs, one of Binance’s largest trading clients, engaged in market manipulation, wash trading and inflated trading volumes amounting to $300 million through deals with crypto projects. After the exchange’s surveillance team recommended offboarding the client, Binance allegedly sided with DWF Labs and fired the investigator, arguing insufficient evidence for the claim.“We affirm our strict market surveillance program [and] do not tolerate market abuse,” He commented. “Over the last three years, we have offboarded nearly 355,000 users with a transaction volume of more than $2.5 trillion for violating our terms of use,” He added, continuing: “Market maker competition is fierce, and our investigation team’s job is to be neutral and look at the evidence without any bias, including bias that might come from market-making firms’ claims against their competitors.”DWF Labs is a prominent trading firm in the crypto industry. Founded by Andrei Grachev in 2021, the firm invests in promising projects and provides long-term financial support. Related: Binance denies reports of DWF Labs market manipulation

Biden backs Gensler as House advances resolution to power-check SEC - Blockworks


President Joe Biden has promised to back Securities and Exchange Commission Chairman Gary Gensler after a resolution to overturn an agency accounting practice advanced out of the House Wednesday evening. 
The House on Wednesday approved joint resolution 109 — which would invalidate the SEC’s Staff Accounting Bulletin (SAB) 121 — in a 228-182 vote. The measure now moves on to the Senate, but Biden’s administration warned it would veto the resolution if it makes it to the president’s desk.
“Limiting the SEC’s ability to maintain a comprehensive and effective financial regulatory framework for crypto assets would introduce substantial financial instability and market uncertainty,” the Biden administration wrote in a statement Wednesday. 
SAB 121, introduced in March 2022 and enacted the following month, states that digital asset custodians should report a liability and “corresponding assets” on their balance sheets for all custodied cryptocurrencies. The practice, SEC staff said, is intended to guard against the “significant risks and uncertainties associated with safeguarding crypto assets.” 
Reps. Mike Flood, R-Neb., Nick Wiley, D-N.C., Tom Emmer, R-Minn., Darren Soto, D-Flo., and French Hill, R-Ark., introduced the joint resolution in the House in February. 
“The SEC issued SAB 121 without conferring with prudential regulators despite the accounting standard’s effects on financial institutions’ treatment of custodial assets, and the SEC issued SAB 121 without going through the notice-and-comment process,” Rep. Flood said of the resolution in a statement earlier this year. “In the face of overreach by a regulator, it is the role of Congress to serve as a check.”

While SABs are not enforceable rules under securities law, they are used by staff for interpretations and practices, the SEC said. Unlike traditional rules issued by the agency, SABs do not require public notice or comment periods and do not reflect the official approval of Commissioners, a point Flood and his co-sponsors find troubling. 
All voting House Republicans were in favor of passing the joint resolution Wednesday. 21 Democrats also supported the measure.
Senator Cynthia Lummis, R-Wyo., a long-time crypto supporter, introduced a companion joint resolution in the Senate, although she lacked bipartisan support. Lummis’ effort has not advanced to Committee markup or a vote, and now that the House’s resolution is making its way to the Senate, the measure is all but dead. 
Gensler in December 2023 defended SAB 121, saying it was “just a staff accounting bulletin,” and it is consistent with precedent set in US bankruptcy court. 
Read more: Empire Newsletter: The SEC’s internal rift
“It basically addresses whether liabilities should be on balance sheet, and what we have found actually in bankruptcy court, time and again, many times now, that indeed bankruptcy courts have said that crypto assets are not bankruptcy remote,” Gensler said during a Dec. 2023 appearance hosted by the American Bar Association. 
Gensler, who has previously denied that he is working against the clock, could face significant headwinds in advancing his agenda after this year’s election. Should Republicans gain control of both chambers in November, additional efforts to overturn and undermine agency policy are likely to continue.

Scammer's Regret? $71 Million Bitcoin Thief Sends Ethereum to Victim - Decrypt

We do the research, you get the alpha!Get exclusive reports and access to key insights on airdrops, NFTs, and more! Subscribe now to Alpha Reports and up your game!Go to Alpha ReportsThe Ethereum user who accidentally sent $71 million worth of Wrapped Bitcoin to the wrong address last week—after being hit with an apparent “address poisoning” scam—may be about to get their money back. Or at least some of it.On May 3, address 0x1E227 sent 1,155 Wrapped Bitcoin (WBTC)—about $71 million worth—to a scammer’s crypto address, after being fooled into thinking the recipient's address was one of their own. The victim has been corresponding with the thief over the blockchain ever since, and was partially refunded with 52 ETH ($156,000) early Thursday.“Please leave your Telegram and I will contact you,” wrote the thief within the blockchain transaction on Thursday.The attacker initially stole the funds through a popular technique called “address poisoning” or “wallet contamination.” This involves a scammer sending a zero-value transaction to a target’s wallet from a crypto address purposefully picked to look like one that the victim regularly corresponds with.In this case, both the victim’s real target address and the scammer’s address began with characters 0xd9A1, and ended with 853a91, making them difficult to tell apart at first glance within most wallet apps.The scammer’s goal is to bait the victim into copying the fake address from their transaction history the next time they intend to send themselves money, and to intercept that transfer for themselves.After losing the funds last Friday, the victim initially messaged the thief to admit that they “won”, and asked that they return 90% of the money, keeping 10% as a clean reward.“We both know that $7 million will definitely make your life better, but $70 million won't let you sleep well,” the victim wrote.The scammer responded by demanding the victim send the $1.6 million in DAI stablecoin remaining at the wallet address, or else they wouldn’t consider the offer. “If you don't, you won't hear from me again & I won't respond,” the scammer wrote.The victim followed up with threats to track down the hacker based on their transaction history if they didn’t take the initial 90/10 offer.“We both know there's no way to clean [these] funds. You will be traced,” the victim wrote. “We also both understand the ‘sleep well’ phrase wasn't about your moral and ethical qualities.”Onlookers joined in on the conversation, with one offering services to provide data about the hacker, such as IP addresses, in return for $100,000. Others came to the scammer’s defense, congratulating the theft and assuring them that the victim’s threat was a bluff—and calling the victim a “dumb, greedy whale.”Edited by Andrew HaywardStay on top of crypto news, get daily updates in your inbox.

3 reasons why Bitcoin traders say a BTC price trend reversal is overdue

Bitcoin (BTC) price is down 1.85% over the last 24 hours and currently trades 17% below its all-time high of $73,835 reached on March 14.BTC/USD daily chart.

Bitcoin’s monthly chart shows the current price range is retesting an area that acted as a resistance when the BTC hit previous all-time highs, as observed by popular analyst Rekt Capital.According to Rekt Capital, this area is now acting as support for BTC since last month’s halving sell-off did not pull the price below this range.“On the monthly timeframe, Bitcoin is still retesting the old All Time High major resistance area (red) as new support (green).”BTC/USD monthly chart. Source: Rekt CapitalFellow analyst Moustache made the same observation, sharing a BTC/USD three-day chart showing that the price was trading at a level close to the previous all-time high.According to Moustache, this has happened only twice in the past—in 2017 and 2020. In both cases, previous all-time highs supported Bitcoin’s price, after which the coin went on a parabolic uptrend, hitting new record highs. Source: MoustacheIn another X post on April 25, Moustache commented on a similar set-up on the monthly chart, saying that BTC was going higher after retesting the line. “After reclaiming the line in 2012, 2016 and 2020, Bitcoin was just getting started. This will go much higher.”Whale accumulation backs Bitcoin’s potential upsideResponding to the market’s drawdown over the last few days, Bitcoin whales took advantage of the entry into the “prime buy zone” and bought more BTC in the dips, according to market intelligence firm Santiment.The analytics firm noted that addresses holding more than 1,000 BTC have “made some accumulation moves over the past 24 hours” as BTC ranged tightly between $61,000 and $64,000.In a May 9 post on the X social platform, Santiment said,“Wallets with 1K-10K $BTC have collectively accumulated ~$941M worth of coins, rebounding to their highest holding level in 2 weeks. ”Bitcoin 1,000-10,000 BTC chart holdings. Source: SantimentThis means large Bitcoin investors are “showing signs of confidence despite price drop to $62.000,” the on-chain data provider explained.

Robinhood CEO says SEC unwilling to facilitate crypto industry despite 'good faith'

Robinhood CEO Vlad Tenev voiced strong concerns about the limitations regarding the accessibility of crypto for Americans and criticized the SEC for its “regulation by enforcement” approach toward the industry.Tenev made the statement during a CNBC interview on May 9, where he also discussed the significant increase in crypto trading on the platform and the SEC’s recent Wells Notice against the firm’s crypto unit that claims it is selling unregistered securities.Regulatory hurdlesRobinhood’s crypto trading volumes surged 224% in the first quarter. Despite this growth, Tenev disclosed that the company’s discussions with the SEC had stalled after 16 meetings without any progress as the regulator did not engage in productive discourse.Tenev explained during the interview:“We tried to create what we call a special purpose broker-dealer for transacting in crypto assets… Unfortunately, a clear path forward with the SEC never emerged, and they did not reciprocate our efforts.”The failed discussions ultimately resulted in the SEC issuing a Wells Notice against the firm, indicating potential enforcement actions for alleged securities violations.Tenev expressed disappointment over the SEC’s decision to halt discussions and highlighted the regulator’s preference for “regulation by enforcement” rather than adapting its rules to facilitate the evolving crypto industry.He argued for regulatory adjustments to permit brokers to incorporate digital assets, a move he believes the SEC is currently reluctant to make.Tenev added that the SEC has the ability to change the regulatory framework for crypto but there seems to be no intent to do so from the regulator.Importance of accessThe Robinhood CEO framed the situation as a broader issue of consumer rights, stressing the importance of crypto and the necessity for Americans to have unfettered access to them.Tenev said the firm does not agree with keeping Americans out of the crypto industry, especially as it is becoming “more and more important.”The Wells Notice against Robinhood marks a significant moment in the broader discussion on how financial regulatory bodies should manage the growing crypto market.The conflict with the SEC places Robinhood at the center of a critical debate over the future of crypto regulation and the role of traditional financial oversight in an increasingly digital economy.Mentioned in this article

BitMEX Co-Founder Arthur Hayes Predicts Bullish Crypto Market Surge Ahead of U.S. Elections



                    

Arthur Hayes, co-founder of BitMEX, believes the next few months present a prime time for cryptocurrency investment, particularly for those with disposable fiat money. 



In an interview with Cointelegraph, Hayes emphasized, “Those people who have fiat and extra cash that want to allocate to crypto, this is the perfect opportunity to do so.” 




He sees the current stagnant market conditions as a golden chance to buy before the expected uptrend in the crypto market.



He attributes the anticipated rise in Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies later this year to inflationary monetary policies. 



Hayes suggests that these policies will play a central role in driving the market upwards.

He states, “Major economies around the world are going to print even more money between now and, say, the next 18 to 24 months,” signaling potential inflationary pressures that could increase the value of decentralized digital currencies like Bitcoin.



Furthermore, Hayes argues that the forthcoming United States presidential elections will act as a bullish catalyst for the cryptocurrency market. 



He believes that financial authorities in the U.S. will likely adopt looser monetary policies to aid President Joe Biden’s reelection campaign. 




Such actions, according to Hayes, will mirror past trends where monetary expansion was linked to rallies in the crypto market.



He explains the process by which governments can influence the economy and, by extension, the crypto market: “When you control the purse of the government, it’s very easy to do so by printing money, borrowing it, and handing it out to people in various forms.” 



This method of monetary manipulation historically correlates with increases in the cryptocurrency market, suggesting a similar outcome could occur in the upcoming election cycle.

DCG First Quarter Revenue Hits $229 Million Despite Grayscale's GBTC Slump - Coincu



	

Key Points:




Digital Currency Group (DCG) reports a strong Q1 2024 performance, with revenues reaching $229 million, marking a 50% year-over-year increase.



Subsidiaries Grayscale, Foundry, and Luno contribute to DCG first quarter revenue growth, despite challenges such as heavy redemptions and increased competition.



Grayscale’s revenue remains steady at $156 million, despite outflows of $17.4 billion post-conversion to an ETF.




According to Bloomberg, Digital Currency Group (DCG) showcased a stellar performance in the first quarter of 2024, posting revenues of $229 million.





DCG First Quarter Revenue Achieves Outstanding Performance



DCG first quarter revenue marks an impressive year-over-year surge of over 50% and an 11% increase from the previous quarter. The surge in revenues aligns with the broader resurgence witnessed in the crypto market during the same period.



Grayscale contributed significantly to the DCG first quarter revenue, accounting for $156 million. Despite facing heavy redemptions and a reduced management fee following the conversion of the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) to an ETF, Grayscale’s revenue remained steady from the previous quarter.



Foundry, another subsidiary of DCG, experienced a 35% increase in revenue quarter-over-quarter, attributed to higher revenue from staking and equipment sales. Similarly, Luno, DCG’s crypto exchange, saw a notable uptick in revenues, up by 46% to $16 million, driven by increased trading volumes amid heightened market activity.




Grayscale’s Steady Revenue Amidst Industry Shifts



The company highlighted key industry developments in Q1, including the approval of Grayscale’s GBTC and spot Bitcoin ETFs in the U.S., and Bitcoin prices hitting all-time highs in March. Despite facing outflows and increased competition, Grayscale’s revenue from GBTC exceeded expectations.



However, Grayscale witnessed outflows of about $17.4 billion since the conversion of GBTC into an ETF, as investors shifted assets to lower-cost funds offered by competitors. Despite this, Grayscale’s ETF still generated $156 million in revenues, reflecting the enduring demand for its products. The company attributed the flat revenue to the redemption and the drop in GBTC’s sponsor fee.



DCG’s robust performance in Q1 underscores the resilience and growth potential of the crypto industry, despite regulatory challenges and market fluctuations.

SEC Scuppers Exodus' Stock Debut in Sudden U-Turn - DailyCoin


        
The SEC has delayed listing the cryptocurrency wallet company Exodus’s stock exchange.



The SEC’s last-minute request for further review mirrors similar challenges other crypto companies face.



Exodus has remained hopeful for a swift resolution and may explore alternative listing options.
Exodus Movement Inc., a leading developer of self-custodial cryptocurrency wallets, hit a hurdle in its journey to a major stock exchange listing. The company announced that the NYSE American, originally slated for a May 9 Class A Common Stock debut, has postponed the listing.Exodus Follows Ripple’s PathThis development highlights the ongoing tension between innovation in the cryptocurrency space and regulatory oversight from government bodies like the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).
The SEC requested further review of Exodus’ registration statement at the last minute, causing the delay. Exodus remains hopeful for a swift resolution and indicated they might seek a listing on a national exchange after the SEC completes its review. In the meantime, trading will continue on the OTC Markets’ OTCQX exchange.“While we are surprised and confused by this last-minute decision, we remain hopeful that the SEC will follow through on its commitment to treat us as the law intends. Exodus has been fully transparent and responsive throughout this process and we expect a swift resolution in this matter,” Exodus CEO JP Richardson exclaimed.This incident isn’t isolated. Ripple, another prominent player in the cryptocurrency industry, faced similar challenges during their IPO plans. In January, Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse shelved the company’s public offering plans due to what he called a “hostile” regulatory environment in the US. Crypto Firms Struggle Against SECThis move followed a legal battle with the SEC, dating back to 2020, over allegations of unregistered securities sales. Referring to the difficulties faced by Coinbase, another major crypto company that encountered legal issues following its IPO despite initial SEC approval, Garlinghouse had this to say:“In the United States, trying to go public with a very hostile regulator that’s approved your S-1, that doesn’t sound like a lot of fun to me,” Garlinghouse stated. The SEC plays a critical role in safeguarding public offerings through regulations. The agency has historically taken a cautious approach towards the cryptocurrency sector. Their rigorous review processes have impacted other companies like Robinhood, which initially delayed its IPO due to SEC scrutiny of its crypto offerings. Robinhood eventually went public in July 2021.
The delay in Exodus’ listing underscores the challenges faced by cryptocurrency companies seeking mainstream recognition through traditional stock exchange listings. As the industry continues to evolve, navigating the complexities of regulations will remain a crucial hurdle for crypto businesses aiming for broader public participation.On the Flipside
A delay in stock exchange listing does not necessarily hinder a company’s growth. Exodus can continue trading on the OTCQX exchange and focus on other avenues for expansion.



Exodus can use this time to strengthen its product and user base, making it more attractive to future investors.
Why This MattersThis incident exemplifies the roadblocks cryptocurrency firms encounter when seeking legitimacy through traditional stock markets. The SEC’s scrutiny of Exodus and Ripple’s shelved IPO plans highlights the potential for regulatory hurdles to stifle innovation and hinder wider public adoption of cryptocurrency businesses.If you found the regulatory hurdles faced by Exodus concerning, then you won’t want to miss this:Grayscale Drops Ether Futures ETF Bid as SEC Stalls ApprovalAre you interested in the recent war on crypto?

                        Binance is fighting back against the DWF Labs allegation against the platform on May 9. This follows an explosive report from the Wall Street Journal (WSJ) that revealed that Binance dismissed an employee who uncovered evidence of market manipulation by DWF Labs, a major market on the trading platform.According to the WSJ report, the dismissed employee and his colleagues at Binance’s market surveillance team had identified instances of pump-and-dump schemes and wash trading conducted by “VIP” clients, including $300M by DWF Labs. These activities violated Binance’s terms and conditions.
Binance & DWF Labs Allegation Entails $300 Million of Wash Trading
The investigators recommended removing DWF Labs from the platform, which they accused of manipulating the price of several cryptos, including the YGG token.Instead, Binance launched an inquiry into the team’s work, claiming there was insufficient evidence of wash trading by DWF Labs. According to the WSJ, the head of surveillance was fired afterward.DWF Labs, an investor in crypto projects that gained prominence in 2023, was reportedly involved in trades of over $4 billion monthly on the Binance platform.In response to the allegations, Binance refuted the claims, asserting they do not tolerate market manipulation.The exchange also revealed its successful record of removing high-profile traders who broke the rules. Binance claimed to have removed over 355,000 users who violated its terms of service in the past. The exchange said the ousted market makers had a combined transaction volume of $2.5 trillion.
Binance & DWF Allegation Slammed as “Unfounded and Not Accurate”
DWF Labs released a Telegram announcement shortly after the WSJ report, which entails the rebuttal of the report that it engaged in price drive, artificial volume, and $300 million of wash trading on Binance in 2023.“It has come to our attention that a recent article contains many allegations that we believe to be unfounded and that do not accurately represent our ethical business practices,” the market-making firm stated. “We have always prioritized our relationship with our partners and the broader community, successfully supporting more than 700 portfolio companies in the crypto ecosystem. We take pride in being compliant, transparent, and diligent in our work.”Last year, Binance settled charges brought forward by multiple US regulators, agreeing to pay $4.3 billion in settlement over alleged violations of operating an unregistered exchange, insufficient controls over market manipulation, and commingling of funds.The US SEC’s litigation against Binance exchange resulted in a plea deal and a settlement of $4.3 billion for violating US anti-money laundering standards. Binance co-founder Changpeng Zhao (CZ) also stepped down as the CEO as part of the settlement. He has been sentenced to four months in prison with an additional fine of $50 million.

In the near future, it may be possible to split a dinner and pay using shares of tokenized funds, a blend made possible by tokenizing assets.Rob Durscki, senior director of tokenization at the Stellar Development Foundation, shared the prediction during the TokenizeThis 2024 event in Miami on May 9. According to him, the bridge between payments and investments will unlock new utilities across financial products. Durscki noted: “What we’re seeing now with partners like Franklin Templeton, WisdomTree, and others issuing this new round of assets on-chain is that they want to unlock yield, [...] but they also want to make it almost seamless to use as a payment tool as well.”Tokenization is the process of converting rights or ownership of an asset, like real estate or stocks, into a digital token on a blockchain. This enables a digital representation of the asset, allowing for fractional ownership, increasing liquidity and making some financial products more accessible to small investors.“Nothing prevents us here from splitting the check on the dinner, and I’ll pay with Franklin Temple funds because I can send you $20 in 3.6 seconds on Stellar. [...] If you forget about that, you’re still getting 5%, 6% a year on that dinner. [...] This positive blur between investment and payment because it’s ultimately value, right? And we’re unlocking the movement of value.” TokenizeThis 2024.

According to Chase, more and more enterprises are seeking to receive stablecoin payments and hold tokens on-chain as a way of generating additional revenue.“Those customers now have their own customers that want to pay in stablecoins and they want to hold those stablecoins. So that’s kind of the simplest on and off-ramp gateway for them into the space.”More than $1 billion worth of U.S. Treasurys has already been tokenized across Ethereum, Stellar, and other blockchains. A recent estimate from Ripple forecasts tokenized markets to reach $16 trillion in the coming years, a figure eight times larger than the total market capitalization of the entire cryptocurrency sector.

Crucial ETH and SEC Statement from Ethereum Co-Founder - Bitcoin Sistemi


Ethereum co-founder and cryptocurrency billionaire Joseph Lubin has expressed concerns about the US Securities and Exchange Commission's (SEC) approach to regulating the cryptocurrency industry. Lubin argues that the SEC's current stance could potentially “cripple” the industry's growth.
Lubin explained that the SEC appears to have reclassified Ethereum as a security without informing the public. The move has raised concerns specifically about ETH spot ETFs, which the SEC fears could flood the cryptocurrency ecosystem with excessive interest and capital.


The SEC also alleged that popular cryptocurrency wallets Coinbase and MetaMask acted as brokers. Lubin warns that this sets a dangerous precedent. “The SEC is now scouring the GitHubs of software developers who don’t even develop financial applications to find out which products can be classified as brokerage firms,” Lubin said.

Lubin believes the SEC's current regulatory approach is an “attempt to paralyze” the crypto industry. He argues that the SEC does not want Ethereum and other cryptocurrencies to shape the banking landscape.





Additionally, Lubin warns that the SEC's anti-crypto stance could cripple Ethereum's growth in the US, hindering acquisition and development. He argues that irrational regulations must be resisted for the sector to grow.
