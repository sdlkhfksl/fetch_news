The collaborations of Polyhedra Network

Polyhedra Network, in collaboration with EigenLayer and Renzo, has emerged as a pioneering force, introducing innovative solutions that enhance interoperability, security, and economic participation among chains. 
At the forefront of this innovation is zkBridge, a revolutionary protocol that facilitates secure and decentralized transmission of messages across different blockchain networks. In the dynamic landscape of blockchain technology, interoperability and security are essential for the smooth operation of decentralized ecosystems.

The collaboration of Polyhedra Network
zkBridge by Polyhedra Network represents a significant step forward in the blockchain sector, offering a decentralized solution for bridging assets across Layer 1 and Layer 2 networks. 
The collaboration with EigenLayer and the integration of the Liquid Restaking Token (LRT) ezETH by Renzo further strengthen the capabilities and security of the zkBridge ecosystem. This collaboration is supported by an impressive economic participation of 1.8 billion US dollars, ensuring a solid crypto-economic security.
Bitcoin, despite its importance in the cryptocurrency space, does not have a native smart contract functionality, which poses challenges for its integration into cross-chain ecosystems. 
However, zkBridge by Polyhedra Network, in collaboration with EigenLayer and Renzo, offers innovative solutions to securely connect Bitcoin to different blockchain networks. Integrating Bitcoin into zkBridge allows other blockchains to interact securely with Bitcoin, promoting low-trust interoperability.
Thanks to EigenLayer’s double-staking mechanism, zkBridge ensures the economic security of Bitcoin’s active validation services (AVS). Validators, equipped with both ZK tokens and Renzo’s ezETH, play a crucial role in ensuring the network’s integrity. In case of malicious activities, users can initiate zkBridge requests to correct discrepancies, safeguarding the network’s integrity and users’ assets.
The slashing mechanism built into Bitcoin AVS acts as a strong deterrent against fraudulent activities, ensuring the integrity of the network. Through careful monitoring and reporting, users contribute to the detection of harmful behaviors. In case of confirmation, the slashing protocol is executed, leading to the confiscation of stakes by dishonest validators. Furthermore, rewards are distributed to stakeholders and honest users, incentivizing active participation and promoting a robust ecosystem.
Fast purposes for Layer 2 networks
Layer 2 networks offer scalability and high transaction speed, but pose interoperability issues between chains. To solve this problem, zkBridge introduces a fast bridging solution that leverages an auxiliary validation network. 
This network attests the state of level 2 networks, ensuring fast finalization while maintaining security levels comparable to native blockchain executions. By simulating blockchain executions, zkBridge achieves fast finalization, significantly reducing transaction finalization time.
The integration of zkBridge with Layer 2 networks involves the verification of state proofs by auxiliary validation networks and the validation of Layer 1 consensus for Layer 2 transactions. Batch proofs are supported to reduce gas costs, improving efficiency and scalability. Through collaboration with EigenLayer, Polyhedra Network introduces dual staking on various blockchains, leveraging ZK tokens for economic security and ecosystem growth.
Renzo’s integration with ezETH enhances the dual staking mechanism, improving economic security and user experience. Renzo’s LRT mechanism incentivizes validators, mitigates risks, and offers liquid restaking capabilities, promoting greater participation and liquidity within the ecosystem. By abstracting complexity and ensuring seamless integration, Renzo enhances the efficiency and security of cross-chain transactions.
Conclusion
The integration of zkBridge, EigenLayer, and Renzo by Polyhedra Network sets a new standard for interoperability, security, and user experience of cross-chains. Thanks to innovative solutions such as zero-knowledge proofs, AVS, and dual staking mechanisms, zkBridge facilitates cross-chain transactions securely and efficiently. 
This collaboration opens up new opportunities for decentralized finance and digital asset management, driving the evolution of blockchain technology towards greater scalability, interoperability, and user empowerment. With a constant focus on innovation and security, Polyhedra Network, EigenLayer, and Renzo pave the way for a decentralized future powered by protocols that reduce trust and seamless cross-chain transactions.

DePIN platform peaq secures $15M in pre-launch round

Update (March 27 at 17:58 UTC): This article has been updated to clarify that peaq is a layer-1 platform for DePINS, and Julia Pönitzsch is not a co-founder. Layer-1 platform peaq — focused on decentralized physical infrastructure networks (DePINs) — has disclosed a $15 million funding round ahead of its mainnet launch in May. The round was led by Generative Ventures and Borderless Capital, with participation from Spartan Group, HV Capital, CMCC Global, Animoca Brands, Moonrock Capital, Fundamental Labs, and other investors. Behind the peaq network is the Berlin-based startup EoT Labs, founded in 2017 by Leonard Dorlöchter, Max Thake, and Till Wendler. The peaq blockchain applies decentralization to physical infrastructure and systems, aiming to build an “Economy of Things” network. According to the company, its ecosystem is home to more than 20 DePIN projects — “already more than the likes of Solana, Polygon and other prominent layer-1s,” the company claimed in a statement to Cointelegraph. 


DePIN uses blockchain technology to incentivize people to build, own and run real-world physical infrastructure, thus distributing control across a network and avoiding centralization in any single organization’s hands. Initiatives in different industries are exploring DePIN use cases, such as energy systems for peer-to-peer energy trading, supply chains, telecommunications for internet access, and data storage for secure data management. Data from intelligence firm Messari indicates that the DePIN market valuation could reach $3.5 trillion in the next four years. The startup offers DePINs with Modular DePIN Functions, which are ready-to-use functions that allow DePINs to build and deploy their projects on the blockchain. Features available for projects include a machine tokenization platform and a DePIN Accelerator program. In 2021, peaq raised nearly $2.7 million in a seed round. The additional funds will be primarily allocated to its ecosystem expansion and further development of solutions for developers. “We will keep working on expanding the ecosystem, which will stand to benefit from more funds going into the Ecosystem Grant Program, and further developing the peaq SDK and the Modular DePIN Functions. All and all, this year is shaping up to be intense, growth-focused, and very promising, which is how we like it,” Leonard Dorlochter, co-founder of peaq, told Cointelegraph.Magazine: Inside Pink Drainer — Security analyst defends his crypto scam franchise

This Altcoin Announces It Will Deposit Assets Into BlackRock's Cryptocurrency Fund - The Price Soars - Bitcoin Sistemi


Ondo (ONDO) announced that it will distribute a significant portion of its OUSG (Ondo Short-Term US Government Bonds) assets to the BlackRock USD Institutional Digital Liquidity Fund (BUIDL).
Following the development, there was a sudden increase in the price of the altcoin:










 
Until now, withdrawals from the OUSG fund have been restricted by traditional “+2 days post-trade” security closing periods, causing delays in investors getting their USD back after the sale of the underlying securities.


However, with the introduction of “+1 day after transaction day” for many types of securities, ONDO believes it has the opportunity to benefit from faster processing, one of the most important advantages of blockchain.
In response, ONDO announced that OUSG will soon offer instant investment and redemption, available 24/7/365.





Additionally, ONDO is introducing a new type of OUSG, the rUSG, with a fixed issue/redemption price of $1.00 per share. Yield will be distributed daily in the form of additional rUSG tokens via token reminting.

Why is the Price of Binance's Latest Launchpool Altcoin Soaring? Up Almost 50 Percent in One Day - Bitcoin Sistemi


Ether.fi, Binance's latest Launchpool project and a liquid restaking protocol, hit an all-time high today as the restaking craze continues to attract cryptocurrency investors.
The token, which represents the voting power in the decision-making process in the management of the protocol, rose by up to 50% to $ 7.2 in the last 24 hours.


This rise allowed ETHFI to recover from the price decline that followed its decline on March 18. After initially rising to $5 on Binance, the altcoin fell below $3 in the following days.
Liquid restaking protocols like Ether.Fi are designed to reuse Ethereum's proof-of-stake blockchain to secure other networks through the original restaking platform, EigenLayer.






According to the data, Ether.fi is the leader in the field of liquid restaking. Its total value locked (TVL) has jumped from $100 million to over $3 billion since the beginning of the year, according to DefiLlama data.
Ignas, a well-known DeFi analyst, noted that the strong price performance of the protocol's governance token, ETHFI, could boost the valuations of other liquid restaking tokens (LRT) to be released in the future. “The higher the ETHFI price, the higher the relative valuations of all other LRT governance tokens will be,” Ignas said.

Blast L2 hack prompts debate over centralization of Ethereum rollups


Yesterday’s $62 million hack of NFT-gaming project Munchables caused a stir amongst the crypto community, with calls for Blast’s core team to manually undo the damage on the centralized rollup.
Fortunately, such controversial action turned out to be unnecessary. Once it became clear that they were unable to get away with their ill-gotten gains, the rogue developer responsible for the theft returned the funds to the Blast team.

Read more: Crypto game exploited for $4.6M, hacker claims to be white-hat
As with The DAO hack on Ethereum in 2016, the incident forces us to consider the implications of interfering with what are supposed to be immutable ledgers.
The hack
Although the ‘hack’ itself was simple, it had been planned well in advance.
Before launch, a rogue developer used their admin access to assign themselves a hefty ether balance in a previous, unverified implementation of the Munchables contract.
Later, when deposits began to stream into the upgraded contracts, the exploiter’s address had plenty of ETH to drain the funds, withdrawing approximately 17,400 ETH, worth over $62 million at the time.
The developer also had admin access to a contract holding over $30 million in funds deposited by another Blast-based project, Juicebox. Centralization risk was identified as low severity in the project’s audit, and the developer’s preparations seemingly went unnoticed.
The culprit
Blockchain sleuth ZachXBT initially suspected that the developer responsible was part of the DPRK’s Lazarus Group of state-sponsored hackers, pointing the finger at a GitHub profile named ‘Werewolves0493.’

He also suggested that four of the project’s ‘developers’ may in fact be the same individual, as they were linked by on-chain transfers and through deposits to shared exchange addresses.
PixelCraft Studios’ CEO, who goes by coderdan.eth on X (formerly Twitter), shared his run-in with the same developer, who was fired “within a month.” Judging by deposits to their Binance addresses, ChainArgos believe the developer has had a handful of short-term jobs over the past 18 months.
Whether this individual was connected to Lazarus or not, attempting to infiltrate crypto teams is a known technique used by the hacking group.
The dilemma
Ever since the US Treasury’s sanctioning of crypto mixer Tornado Cash, credible censorship resistance has become an important measure of a blockchain’s decentralization. The hope is that if there’s no single entity to accuse of interacting with sanctioned addresses, then there’s nobody to prosecute. 
Likewise, though, if a US-based development team has sufficient admin powers to revert the effects of hacks or the actions of sanctioned entities, it may find itself obliged to do so. 
Precedents have been set in the past. Last year, Jump Crypto conducted a ‘counter-exploit’ to recover the 120,000 ETH lost in 2022’s Wormhole hack, worth over $300 million at the time.
Also in 2022, Binance-linked BNB Chain was halted by its validators, ensuring that the proceeds of a $600 million bridge hack couldn’t be siphoned to other, less censorable chains.
Blast itself isn’t exactly a prime example of crypto’s ‘trustlessness’ ethos, nor is it a paragon of decentralization.

Read more: Critics decry Blast as the latest sketchy scheme on Ethereum
When Blast was launched, alongside a FOMO-inducing points program, it offered ‘native yield’ on ETH and stablecoins, despite deposits simply going into a multisig wallet while the network itself was being built.
Blast’s status as a mostly experimental sandbox which doesn’t prioritize decentralization as much as other networks led some to believe that using centralized powers to manually revert unsavoury activities should be encouraged in order to make users whole.
But others argue that such a move could be seen as a sign of approval for other centralized rollups (e.g. Optimism and Base) that might be forced to censor their network activity.

The DAO
The debate brought back memories of 2016’s The DAO hack which, incidentally, involved a similar dollar amount lost (3.6M ETH, which would be worth almost $13B today).

Read more: Ethereum’s Dencun causes ‘Blast’ layer 2 outage 
The ‘hard fork’, designed to reverse the damage, resulted in a chain split leading to today’s Ethereum mainnet and the continuation of the pre-fork chain, now known as Ethereum Classic.
Given the frequency at which Ethereum users have been exposed to losses of $60 million and above since then, a hard fork to remedy a hack seems almost unthinkable.

Wealth Market Eyeing 3% Allocation to Bitcoin, Says Bitwise CIO - Benzinga

Following discussions with professional investors about their allocations to Bitcoin BTC/USD, "3% is the new 1%" according to Bitwise CIO Matt Hougan. "I've been speaking with professional investors about bitcoin since 2018. For the past six years, the discussion has mostly focused on a 1% allocation. That's the most that most investors would think about" Hougan wrote on X. "Boy, has that changed. Almost every investor I've spoken with has talked about a 3%+ allocation." Hougan argued the newly-launched U.S. spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds were the primary reason for the shift, de-risking bitcoin's downside. "If ‘going to zero' is off the table, 3% or 5% starts to make more sense" he said. "True institutional investors (pensions, endowments, etc.) will still eye sub 1% allocations, but for the wealth market, 3%+ is the new new thing."Read the full story at The Block.© 2024 Benzinga.com.

KuCoin drops 17% in 24 hours amidst criminal allegations - AMBCrypto



U.S. prosecutors charge KuCoin with anti-money laundering violations and misleading investors.
CEO Johny Lyu addresses regulatory scrutiny, emphasizing that KuCoin is not an exception. 

In a significant development, U.S. Federal prosecutors have leveled charges against KuCoin [KCS], a prominent cryptocurrency exchange, and two of its founders for allegedly breaching anti-money laundering regulations. 
Amid mounting fear, uncertainty, and doubt (FUD), CEO Johnny Lyu highlighted that regulatory scrutiny is common across the cryptocurrency industry. 
He noted, 
“The challenge we’re facing is not unique to KuCoin but rather typical growth and regulatory issues encountered by emerging industries.”
Lyu in defense of KuCoin 
The charges alleged that KuCoin operated within the United States misled investors about its U.S. operations, and neglected to register with relevant U.S. government bodies.
This happened while failing to uphold an anti-money laundering program.
Additionally, Lyu highlighted the inevitability of regulatory gaps in the early stages of an industry’s development, such as cryptocurrencies. He emphasized,
“Early-stage development often sees regulatory gaps, but as the industry matures, we move towards and embrace compliance and standardization.”
Rising optimism amidst upheaval 
All these have influenced the price pattern of Kucoin. At the time of writing, the token was trading at $12.02, marking a 17.08% decline within a single day. 
Despite the recent turmoil surrounding KuCoin, Ki Young Ju’s (the founder of CryptoQuant) insights provide an optimistic perspective. 
According to him, KuCoin appears to be functioning normally amid the panic, with on-chain data indicating increased Bitcoin and Ethereum withdrawals, primarily from retail investors. 
Moreover, there are no signs suggesting KuCoin mixes customer funds, and the exchange maintains adequate reserves to fulfill withdrawal requests. 
This perspective offers stability amidst the uncertainty surrounding the exchange, highlighting the resilience of the platform amidst regulatory challenges.

SafeDAO may finally vote to make SAFE tokens transferable - Blockworks


SafeDAO, the organization governing the smart wallet platform Safe, may soon vote on the possibility of making its SAFE token transferable.
SAFE tokens, introduced in 2022, are a form of digital assets designed for governance within the SafeDAO ecosystem. Over the past two years, recipients of these tokens have been able to use their allocations to vote on proposals that affect the development and operational decisions of the SafeDAO platform.
Initially, these tokens were non-transferable; they couldn’t be bought, sold or traded on any platform. This design choice was likely aimed at ensuring that only stakeholders with a long-term interest in the platform’s success could influence its direction, rather than speculative traders.
Read more: Solana welcomes Circle’s cross-chain transfer protocol
If enacted, the decision to make SAFE tokens transferable will mark a notable shift in SafeDAO’s strategy. Allowing transfers will increase liquidity, making it possible for people to buy and sell SAFE tokens, and will widen participation in governance by attracting a larger and more diverse group of token holders.
André Geest, the head of governance at Safe, told Blockworks that this newfound flexibility could allow the project’s DAO treasury to fund interesting projects within the ecosystem. It could also enable the organization to set up a rewards program and incentivize the usage of safe smart accounts.
“The token also plays a role in this future design space,” Geest said. “When you think about security abstraction, the token could play a role in curating registries. When it comes to payment abstraction, it could help facilitate fee transfers, for instance.”
Making sure tokens are safe
An initial vote to make SAFE tokens transferable in 2022 failed after some community members said, amid hundreds of forum replies, that SafeDAO should first more clearly define its mission and operations.
Geest explained that the 2022 vote hadn’t passed due to a combination of both internal and external factors.
“It was seen that the DAO was not mature enough, in the sense that it didn’t yet have a North Star. Also, one could say that the DAO didn’t have a market fit or a product fit,” Geest said. 
Additionally, following the collapse of FTX, many participants believed token transfers should be suspended until market conditions improved.
In response, a second proposal passed, outlining five milestones the DAO should meet before SAFE tokens would become transferable — ending the SAFE claim period, ratifying a constitution and then a governance framework, voting on how funds should be spent and deciding on the token’s utility. 
Read more: Safe social recovery eases private key management
Fifteen months later, SafeDAO has finally ticked off all five of the milestones, and a Snapshot vote is slated to go live that would make SAFE transferable. 
Luuk Weber, a SafeDAO delegate with experience in multiple DAOs dating back to 2019, called SafeDAO’s milestone system the “most structured approach I’ve seen in any DAO when it comes to aligning on operating logic prior to token transferability.”

“A lot of work has gone into these milestones from a lot of people, there was really heavy lifting from all parts, I think there’s genuinely a very positive sentiment to the progress that has been made, and the progress Safe has made with the product,” Geest said. 
Outside of the DAO, Safe has continued its development of smart accounts that make use of tools like account abstraction to let users create wallets with only an email. Worldcoin uses Safe to create wallets for its users inside of the World App.

Bitcoin Whale Moves 2,000 BTC Dormant for 14 Years


																An unknown individual or entity recently consolidated 2,000 BTC mined in 2010 into a single wallet.
This consolidation, noted by developer mononautical on X, occurred on March 26, involving the transfer of 40 sets of mining rewards, each consisting of 50 BTC, into one wallet.
Bitcoin Miner’s 14-Year Hold Pays Off
Reflecting on the situation, mononautical remarked, “Imagine holding for 14 years as the value rockets from a few hundred dollars to $140 million.” Notably, at the time of mining, the rewards amounted to $600.


Responding to the revelation, another X user, @Psifour, raised concerns about the possibility of compromised key generation, suggesting either a known pool or a random origin for the rewards.




However, mononautical clarified that the miner remains unidentified, suggesting the transfer may have been a strategic move rather than a security breach. “It’s possible the keys were compromised, but it seems like this went straight to an OTC desk,” mononautical added, citing a previous instance of similar old mining wallet sweeps.
This news follows another significant Bitcoin movement over the weekend. The fifth richest Bitcoin address, which had remained dormant since 2019, suddenly sprung to life. According to blockchain analytics firm Arkham, in 2019, this address was funded with 94,500 BTC worth $6.05 billion. The Bitcoin remained untouched until recently when it was divided and transferred to new addresses.
Bitcoin Faces Sell-Side Liquidity Crisis
Adding to the discourse, CryptoQuant founder and CEO Ki Young Ju pointed out that the consolidation indicates a “sell-side liquidity crisis waking up old Bitcoin.” Ju also suggested that the transaction pattern indicates over-the-counter (OTC) sales of the funds.
Meanwhile, CryptoQuant’s latest “Weekly Crypto Report” outlined an upcoming “sell-side liquidity crisis.” The report attributed the crisis to a surge in Bitcoin demand, mainly fueled by the introduction of spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) in the U.S. This heightened demand has drastically reduced the available supply for sale.
According to the report, Bitcoin’s liquid inventory has reached its lowest level ever in terms of months of demand, with current supply only sufficient to cover demand growth for twelve months.
It was also highlighted that when considering Bitcoin available strictly on U.S. exchanges, the supply would only be able to meet the demand for half as long, dropping to six months of demand if Bitcoin from exchanges outside the U.S. is excluded. This exclusion is based on the premise that U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs will solely source Bitcoin from U.S. entities.

$7.5B AI crypto token merger scheduled for community voting on April 2

A token merger to the tune of $7.5 billion consisting of artificial intelligence (AI) protocols, SingularityNet, Fetch.ai, and Ocean Protocol, is scheduled for a community vote of approval on April 2.According to the March 27 announcement, there will be three separate community votes for each individual protocol, with completion of all voting scheduled for April 16. If the union is approved, the Artificial Superintelligence Allia(ASI) token will replace the SingularityNet (AGIX), Fetch.ai (FET), and Ocean Protocol (OCEAN) tokens, respectively, with ASI having a fully diluted market cap of $7.5 billion across 2.631 billion tokens. The three tokens' current combined market cap is around $5.3 billion. "If approved, it will then be possible to swap $FET for Artificial Superintelligence token at a rate of 1:1," developers wrote. "For example, if you hold 100 $FET, you will be able to swap it for 100 $ASI." The FET token will be the reserve currency of ASI, while users will be able to convert OCEAN and AGIX into ASI at a new fixed rate.An additional 1.48 billion ASI tokens will be minted with 867 million ASI allocated to AGIX holders and 611 million ASI allocated to OCEAN token holders. Therefore, Singularity and Ocean token holders will "receive 0.433226 $ASI per $OCEAN and 0.433350 $ASI per $AGIX" as a result of the merger. As per Fetch.ai developers:"If you have $OCEAN and $AGIX tokens on an exchange, no action is needed. We will work with each exchange to ensure a smooth conversion and your holdings will automatically be converted to $ASI tokens directly by the exchange. You won’t see $OCEAN or $AGIX on the exchange — but don’t panic! Your tokens are there, just look for the $ASI symbol."In addition, the swap mechanism will be available indefinitely for OCEAN and AGIX users holding tokens on self-custody wallets to convert their balance. As announced the same day, the novel Superintelligence Alliance will share the common goal of developing blockchain-based decentralized AI protocols, which can't be controlled by centralized parties or large stakeholders.Related: Fetch.ai announces GPU rewards for tokenholders after $100M infrastructure investment

                        Solana meme coins continue to dominate the market, and in the latest move Mew Cat Coin (MEW) has exploded after going viral on X.This article will provide an analysis of MEW’s current price trends, and look to see whether the latest incarnation of Dogecoin, represents a more promising investment opportunity.Retail meme coin traders on X are jubilant, as the viral success of MEW’s explosive rally continues to hold strong across the social network – but can price explode to hit $1Bn market cap?MEW Price Analysis: Can The New Big Cat In Town Surge to Top Solana Meme Coin Status?
As price action consolidates at lower trendline support, Mew the Cat is currently trading at a market price of $0.00134 (representing a 24-hour change of -29.87%).This comes after MEW cat coin launched at just 6 AM (UTC) on March 26, in a listing that gained rapid traction due to sudden virality amongst Solana meme coin traders on X.MEW price increased aggressively, surging +15,500% across 7 hours of sustained upside moves, to hit an all-time high of $0.0037 at 12 PM on March 26.Yet, the dramatic move saw early backers amass huge gains, and a wave of profit-taking has swept into the chart in the hours since, with price tumbling -64% as a consequence.This has left an army of 9.19k holders fighting to establish consolidation above lower support at $0.001.However, with a whopping market cap of $118M, upside movements become tough from here on out – with a 10x move now contingent on an influx of over $900m in volume.For this reason, many retail investors are shifting their attention to the viral success of the Dogecoin20 presale – which would need 10x less volume to see a 10x price boom.DOGECOIN20 Hits Viral Success: Over $10M Raised as New Investors Race to Next Dogecoin Project
Dogecoin’s recent price gains have fuelled major interest in spin-off projects, and now investors are racing to take a position in a new crypto presale with over $10m raised so far for the next incarnation of the top DOGE.Viral success triggered Dogecoin20’s explosion above $10M raised, with the presale now heading for an imminent sell-out, so don’t miss the last window of opportunity to get in as an early-bird Dogecoin20.Dogecoin20 is the next-generation version of the top coin in the vertical Dogecoin (DOGE), and investor appetite has been fuelled by the chance to buy in at just 0.0001% of Dogecoin’s market cap.To put things in perspective, if DOGECOIN20 replicates just 1% of Dogecoin’s success, and hits a $192M market cap – investors could be sat atop a 50x return.Next Generation Meme Coins: With viral traction amongst new retail investors, Dogecoin20 is poised to revolutionize the meme coin vertical in the year ahead. With over $10m raised in its first 2 week of presale, this innovative token pays homage to the OG meme coin while setting the stage for a new generation of moon boys.Innovative Tokenomics: Dogecoin20 sets the stage for success in its tokenomics; it’s a powerhouse of innovation. Featuring a capped supply and an ingenious staking mechanism, this token rewards active participation and shields against inflation, setting a new standard for meme coins everywhere.Mission & Roadmap: Leading the charge into the 2024 bull run, Dogecoin20 champions the idea of “Do Only Good Everyday.” With a roadmap focused on charity, community support, and real-world impact, this project aims to redefine the crypto landscape and pave the way for a brighter, more inclusive future.Join the Revolution: Be part of something special.

After Months, Another Bitcoin Spot ETF Launched in the US - This One Is Different from the Others - Bitcoin Sistemi


The United States added one more spot Bitcoin ETF, bringing the total to eleven ETFs. This comes more than two months after the launch of the top ten spot BTC ETFs.
The latest addition to the list is asset manager Hashdex's Bitcoin Futures ETF, which has been trading on the New York Stock Exchange since 2022 as a futures-based fund under the ticker DEFI. The fund has now been renamed and converted to Hashdex Bitcoin ETF, which operates as a spot Bitcoin fund.


Hashdex announced in a press release that unlike other spot Bitcoin ETFs, DEFI can hold up to 5% of the fund's assets in BTC futures contracts traded on CME. According to the statement, this futures allocation will enable DEFI to more accurately track the BTC price over time and provide a more predictable fund creation/redemption process.

This approach is not new for ETFs. In fact, most S&P 500 ETFs use a similar strategy, according to the company. DEFI currently holds 5,500 BTC and a modest number of futures contracts. At 0.90%, the fund's expense ratio is lower than Grayscale Bitcoin Trust's (GBTC) 1.50%, but higher than the other nine spot products.

SEC Lawsuit Against Coinbase Moves Forward-How Bad Is It? - Decrypt

A federal judge overseeing the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission’s (SEC) sweeping lawsuit against Coinbase ruled Wednesday that the regulator’s arguments against the crypto exchange are largely “plausible,” permitting the case to proceed and denying Coinbase’s motion to dismiss it in its entirety.Rulings on motions to dismiss, such as today’s, are not resolutions of factual disputes. When evaluating such motions, federal judges only dismiss a case if there is not plausible evidence that a law has been violated, even when assuming all facts alleged by a plaintiff to be true.In today’s ruling, however, U.S. District Judge Kathleen Failla not only found most of the SEC’s claims against Coinbase fit for trial, but also indicated support for the agency’s broader, long standing argument about crypto: Many tokenized assets constitute securities schemes, and fall under the SEC’s purview.“The ‘crypto’ nomenclature may be of recent vintage, but the challenged transactions fall comfortably within the framework that courts have used to identify securities for nearly eighty years,” Judge Failla wrote.On two major claims, Judge Failla allowed the SEC’s case against Coinbase to proceed: that Coinbase operates as an unregistered securities exchange for retail and institutional investors, and that its crypto staking programs constitute additional offerings of unregistered securities.A third claim against Coinbase, however—that via the Coinbase Wallet, the company conducts brokerage activity—was dismissed by Judge Failla. The logic relied on by Failla to dismiss the claim was specific only to the legal definition of a brokerage and does little to aid Coinbase’s remaining case against the SEC.On Twitter, Coinbase Chief Legal Officer Paul Grewal wrote that he was not surprised by today’s ruling.https://twitter.com/iampaulgrewal/status/1772993916146479193“We were prepared for this,” Grewal said. “Early motions like ours against a government agency are almost always denied. But clarity is the ultimate goal and today’s decision continues us on that path.”The SEC’s case against Coinbase now proceeds to discovery. Judge Failla has instructed both parties to submit proposed case management plans by April 19.When Coinbase argued the merits of its motion to dismiss the case in January, Failla appeared intrigued by arguments made by crypto industry advocates.But her ruling today may have indicated not just trouble ahead for Coinbase, but for the crypto industry’s broader, ongoing battle against federal regulators.Buried within Judge Failla’s 84-page judgment was a rejection of Coinbase’s claim that the SEC has violated federal law by failing to disclose its crypto policy. Earlier this week, the DeFi Education Fund sued the SEC on similar grounds.“The SEC is not announcing a new regulatory policy,” Judge Failla wrote today, dismissing such arguments. “But rather is simply engaging in a fact-intensive application of an existing standard—an application that Coinbase also conducted—to determine whether certain transactions involving crypto-assets meet the characteristics of an ‘investment contract.’”Edited by Stacy Elliott.Stay on top of crypto news, get daily updates in your inbox.

Altcoins Are “Heavily Undervalued,” - Renowned Crypto Analyst


							

Michaël van de Poppe thinks altcoins are still “heavily undervalued.”



Poppe believes an upcoming Bitcoin correction will lead to an altcoin rally.



According to Poppe, the expected Fed interest rate decision will impact the market in the medium term.




Renowned cryptocurrency analyst Michaël van de Poppe thinks altcoins are still “heavily undervalued.” In a recent post on X, Poppe noted that altcoins are slowly moving upward. He cited Chainlink (LINK) as one of the altcoins experiencing significant strength. However, he believes the altcoin season has yet to begin fully.







Poppe’s post on X referenced one of his recently uploaded YouTube videos, where he analyzed the altcoin market, highlighting the current pre-halving trend. The analyst compared the current altcoin market to the situation before the 2016 Bitcoin halving.



According to Poppe, although Bitcoin did not reach a new all-time high (ATH) before the 2016 halving event, the trend of that cycle remains similar to the current price development. He noted a significant impulsive Bitcoin move pre-halving, resulting in a relatable correction. 



Meanwhile, the renowned analyst believes there is still a chance for a pre-halving correction following the current Bitcoin rally. He thinks the expected correction will enable altcoins to perform significantly well. However, Poppe cited the anticipated macroeconomic data expected soon from the U.S. Federal Reserve to impact the crypto market.



In further explanation, Poppe noted that he does not expect the Fed to cut down on interest rates. He thinks that would trigger the market to drop before making its way back up. In his opinion, not cutting down on interest rates would be positive for the market in the medium term.



Poppe noted that the crypto total market cap is closing up on the ATH. He thinks after the recent surge, the wholesale metric would experience some consolidation before continuing upwards. However, the analyst acknowledged the role of Bitcoin’s dominance in the crypto ecosystem. He thinks it is nearing a pre-halving peak that would trigger a capital rotation to the benefit of altcoins.

Roger Ver would support Bitcoin again if this happens


Roger Ver was one of the most vocal and important figures for Bitcoin’s (BTC) worldwide adoption in the early days.
The well-known investor and entrepreneur appeared in an interview on the Bitcoin Takeover Podcast on March 27. Among different topics, Roger Ver discussed with Vlad Costa about Ross Ulbricht’s 40th birthday, his thoughts on cryptocurrencies, and what would take Ver to vocally support Bitcoin again.
In particular, he explains that he would need to see Bitcoin being able to provide more economic freedom to the world. However, Roger Ver does not think this has been the case for the past seven years.



“As soon as I see BTC as a product that could have a chance to provide more economic freedom to the world, I would be right back there, in a moment. But, at the moment, I see projects like Monero, Zano, Bitcoin Cash, Litecoin, and things like that having a much much bigger potential impact in freedom for the world.”
– Roger Ver

Moreover, Roger Ver explained that the cryptocurrency world has seen a move from BTC to Monero (XMR) in the darknet. This, according to him, was due to Monero’s privacy features, which help to “bring more economic freedom to the world,” in Ver’s words.

Roger Ver’s new book: Hijacking Bitcoin
The once known as “Bitcoin Jesus” has stepped away from supporting the most capitalized version of Bitcoin, BTC, in 2017. Roger Ver was, back then, one of the main supporters of the alternative, Bitcoin Cash (BCH). BCH aims to be an efficient medium of exchange, besides being a solid store of value, as the narrative behind what we currently know as Bitcoin.

“Whatever people can use as a medium of exchange is also what they want to use as their store of value.”
– Roger Ver

Interestingly, Roger Ver talked about a new book he is launching with Steve Patterson, now in pre-order on Amazon. The book is called “Hijacking Bitcoin: The Hidden History of BTC” and has already made the first place for new releases in “General Technology & Reference.” It is also possible to pay for the book using BCH.
On the notes about “Hijacking Bitcoin,” he comments:

“There is history that needs to be told. For the most part, the histories are told by the victors. The big block side, until now, has lost in terms of the Bitcoin-scaling war, but I think it’s really important for both sides to be heard. And one side engaged in a bunch of censorship and dirty and immoral tactics that are outlined in the book.”
– Roger Ver

Is Bitcoin priced by the free market?
In the discussion between Bitcoin and Bitcoin Cash, the known freedom enthusiast slams external interference on the BTC price.
First, he says that “the free market is never done speaking,” about Bitcoin having a larger value than the alternatives. Second, he explains how, so far, there is no real “free market” dynamics in play to price Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies.

“It is not a free market at all. Not even remotely close. You have all these bureaucrats and politicians all over the world setting rules for this, and rules for that. BTC is allowed to have an ETF today, maybe Ethereum will next week, and Ripple is in trouble with the SEC, Bitcoin Cash is in limbo, Monero is not allowed to be listed on exchanges in half the countries around the world because it is too private. We are not even remotely close to a free market.”
– Roger Ver

In this context, Roger Ver had also said he believed the cryptocurrency market would have a lot more relevance and value today if Bitcoin had performed well as a medium of exchange.
All in all, the interview lasted for nearly one and a half hours. It was one of the longest interviews with Roger Ver in the past few years. Moving forward, the market could now expect to hear more from the “Bitcoin Jesus.”

RWA Platform Ondo Finance Will Use BlackRock's Ethereum-Based BUIDL Fund to Back Its T-Bill Token OUSG

Ondo's action marks the first example of a crypto protocol leveraging asset management giant BlackRock's tokenized fund offering, which debuted last week. The fund, represented by the Ethereum-based BUIDL token backed by U.S. Treasury bills and repo agreements, is targeted for white-listed, institutional clients and requires at least $5 million minimum allocation. While the strict requirements prohibits smaller investors to invest in BlackRock's BUIDL, it allows other platforms such as Ondo to leverage the fund for its own retail-facing offerings.

Ethereum ETF Delays as US Lawmakers Demand Clarity from SEC - DailyCoin


        
Congress demands clarity on Ethereum’s status after ETF approvals stall.



ETF decision delays prompt calls for definitive crypto regulations.



SEC asked to provide comprehensive guidance on crypto assets. 
In the crypto ecosystem, Ethereum is a key player and the biggest platform for DeFi and decentralized applications. However, its regulatory status remains uncertain, especially as the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) deliberates on approving ETH-based Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs).Recent developments have seen a group of US lawmakers stepping into the fray, seeking clarity from the SEC regarding Ethereum’s classification and the broader regulatory definitions affecting digital assets.Lawmakers Demand SEC ClarityOn Tuesday, March 26, a group of Republican lawmakers, led by prominent figures in the House Financial Services Committee and House Committee on Agriculture, wrote a letter to the SEC, asking for clarity on digital assets, specifically Ethereum. The letter, signed by 48 lawmakers, directly responds to Prometheum Capital, which will offer custody services for ETH to institutional clients later this month. Lawmakers inquired whether Special Purpose Broker-Dealers (SPBD) can have custody over non-security digital assets like Ethereum.Lawmakers remarked that the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) and the SEC have a record of classifying Ethereum as not a security. However, they also stated that the SEC has hesitated to classify ETH, which has led to heightened uncertainty expressly.The letter also delves into the broader implications of the SEC’s regulatory approach. It emphasizes the potential negative effects on the digital asset markets. A lack of clear guidelines and consistent regulatory policy could impact Ethereum’s derivatives market and influence the broader digital asset landscape. 



The SEC’s wavering is already impacting several major institutions that have filed applications for Ethereum ETFs. SEC’s Postpones Decision on Ethereum ETFsThe SEC has recently postponed its decision on the applications for Ether (ETH) Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs) from major financial institutions like BlackRock and Fidelity. These delays come despite previous approvals for Bitcoin-based ETFs. Final deadlines for these decisions have been extended to May 2024, reflecting the SEC’s ongoing evaluation process and its call for public comments on these ETF applications. Moreover, recent reports revealed that the SEC is looking to classify Ethereum as a security, a move that would most likely block Ethereum ETFs. 



This postponement of the decision and the latest investigations have raised doubts among traders about the approval of Ethereum ETFs. A Bloomberg analysis put the approval odds at just 25% due to the SEC’s lack of engagement with the process. On the Flipside
Despite the calls for a new framework on digital assets, the SEC has maintained that current regulation is enough. 



SEC Commissioner Hester Peirce has been a vocal critic of the agency’s approach to digital assets, spearheading the call for regulatory clarity. 
Why This MattersEthereum’s role as a foundational platform for DeFi, NFTs, and other decentralized applications makes its regulatory classification a pivotal issue for stakeholders in the crypto space.Read more about Ethereum ETF’s winning approval by the SEC: Ethereum ETF Approval Odds Dim to 25% Due to SEC’s InactionRead more about Tether’s big AI play: Tether Bets Big on AI: Can Blockchain Take on Big Tech?

AMC forgot about NFTs


There was a brief period where the movie theater and gold mining conglomerate AMC participated in the then-trendy NFT market, releasing several different collections tied in with various movies or the concept of stock ownership.
Twelve collections were initially released over 306 days, however, it’s been 527 days since the last one listed on the AMC website’s NFT page was released.
Back in this heady era, AMC proudly mentioned NFTs in its financial filings, and even claimed that it would “continue to implement innovative NFT offers to further engage and build loyalty with our guests.” 
The first NFT launch — a tie-in with Spider-Man – No Way Home — reportedly crashed both AMC and Fandango’s websites and led to chief exec Adam Aron to state that the “Spider-Man NFT is a key reason why No Way Home generated the second highest one-day ticket sales in AMC’s entire history.” 

However, it wasn’t mentioned in the next quarter’s filing and hasn’t been mentioned in quarterly filings since. 
The NFTs still exist and are still traded, albeit with varying degrees of value. Someone purchased several of the Spider-Man NFTs several weeks ago, and they were willing to pay almost $20 for each of them. Yesterday, someone also paid $10 for a Batman NFT but most collections are less liquid and traded than these.

SEC Asks Judge To Order Ripple To Pay Nearly $2,000,000,000 in Fines and Penalties - The Daily Hodl


								The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has asked a judge to order Ripple to pay nearly $2 billion in fines and penalties.
The SEC first sued the payments company in late 2020 for allegedly selling XRP as an unregistered security.










Last summer, US District Judge Analisa Torres ruled that Ripple’s automated, open-market sales of XRP, referred to as programmatic sales, did not constitute security offerings, contrary to what the SEC alleged.
The judge did, however, side with the SEC’s claim that Ripple’s sale of XRP directly to institutional buyers constituted a securities offering.
James K. Filan, a defense lawyer and crypto legal expert, shared the SEC’s new Motion for Remedies and Entry of Final Judgment, which was submitted to the court on Monday.
The SEC has asked the court to order Ripple to pay $876,308,712 in disgorgement, $198,150,940 in prejudgment interest, and a $876,308,712 civil penalty, which totals around $1.95 billion.
Argues the regulator,
“Ripple’s years-long, nearly $1 billion, course of violations of the securities laws alone warrants injunctions, significant penalties, and the disgorging of Ripple’s profits. Additional evidence shows the egregiousness of Ripple’s misconduct, highlighting the importance of this relief for deterrence and to ensure Ripple ceases its illegal conduct.”
Stuart Alderoty, Ripple’s chief legal officer, accuses the SEC of trading in “statements that are false, mischaracterized and designed to mislead.”
“Rather than faithfully apply the law, the SEC remains bent on wanting to punish and intimidate Ripple – and the industry at large. We trust the Court will approach the remedies phase fairly.”

SEC vs. Ripple Resolution Nears: Is $2B Fine the Final Stroke? - DailyCoin


        
Ripple will face a potential $2 billion fine if the SEC succeeds in classifying XRP as a security.



Both parties could still choose to settle, avoiding a definitive ruling on XRP’s status.



The court has not yet determined the verdict, and the final judgment could be significantly different.
The long-running legal battle between the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and Ripple Labs appears to be nearing its conclusion. The case concerns whether XRP, Ripple’s native token, constitutes an unregistered security. SEC Seeks $2 Billion from RippleThe SEC levied charges against Ripple in December 2020, alleging the company raised over $1.3 Billion through the unregistered sale of XRP tokens. A recent filing by the SEC in the remedies stage seeking disgorgement of $876 Million, which they believe represents Ripple’s net profits from the unregistered sales along with prejudgment interest and a civil penalty, brings the total requested in remedies to nearly $2 Billion.Ripple maintains that XRP is a utility token and not a security, and therefore, it is exempt from SEC registration. They argue that their sales to institutional investors caused no harm and that the SEC’s accusations stifle innovation in cryptocurrency. Ripple’s CLO has stated that their response to the SEC’s filing will be submitted next month and has asserted that the SEC’s statements are false, mischaracterized, and designed to mislead.What’s at Stake?For Ripple, a loss in court could have significant repercussions. A hefty fine would undoubtedly impact their finances, but more importantly, a ruling classifying XRP as a security would subject Ripple to stricter regulations and potentially hinder XRP’s adoption and use case.



While a resolution appears imminent, the final ruling and any imposed penalties remain to be seen. The court could decide in favor of either party or even settle. Here are some possibilities:
Ripple Wins: If the court favors Ripple, it would be a significant blow to the SEC’s efforts to regulate the cryptocurrency industry.



SEC Wins: A win for the SEC would establish a precedent for future enforcement actions against ICOs and token sales. The $2 Billion fine could be imposed, though the final amount may be less.



Settlement: Both parties could reach a settlement agreement, potentially involving a financial penalty but avoiding a definitive classification of XRP as a security.
The $2 billion figure being circulated represents the SEC’s claim, not a predetermined penalty by the court. The verdict is yet to be determined, and the final judgment could be significantly less or even entirely removed, depending on the court’s decision. On the Flipside
Even with a court decision, a lengthy appeals process could delay any final resolution for Ripple and the crypto industry.



The $2 billion fine isn’t the final judgment for Ripple; they still need to file their response, and the judge will make the final decision.



XRP community members argue that the SEC’s $2B damages claim appears excessive, considering Ripple’s $15B market cap loss at the time of the lawsuit’s filing. They assert the SEC should be accountable for investors’ losses due to its approach.
Why This MattersThis lawsuit sets a potential precedent for how the SEC regulates cryptocurrency tokens. A clear ruling will impact Ripple, XRP, and other companies dealing with token sales, influencing how they structure their offerings and potentially affecting the overall adoption of cryptocurrencies.

KuCoin Moves 2T SHIB in Strange Move as the Law Closes in - DailyCoin


        
KuCoin saw massive outflows yesterday as holders panic over DoJ charges.



Co-founders face allegations from the United States Department of Justice.



On Wednesday, SHIB reclaimed $0.00003, hovering around $18bn market cap.
The United States Department of Justice (DoJ) sent ripples through the cryptosphere yesterday, slapping KuCoin, one of the globe’s leading crypto exchanges, with serious criminal charges for alleged money laundering.Here’s What Set Off the Swirl of Huge WithdrawalsIn an official statement by the DoJ on March 26, 2024, two of KuCoin’s co-founders are accused of conspiring to violate the Bank Secrecy Act by “willfully failing to maintain an adequate anti-money laundering (AML) program,” which is aimed to prevent the exchange from being used for money laundering and terrorism financing.Naturally, the legal scrutiny has caused panic among KuCoin’s users, who rushed to withdraw their assets. Crypto whales have been spotted relocating tens of millions in popular stablecoins like Tether USD (USDT) and USD Coin (USDC) to competing crypto exchanges like Bybit and OKX.Following the accelerated outflows on KuCoin, blockchain analytics firm LookOnChain spotted a 32 million USDT deposit to Bybit on Wednesday morning. According to the reserve statistics, KuCoin now holds approximately $6.137B in digital assets, including over $1bn of Bitcoin (BTC) and 3.37T, or $104.95 million of the popular Japanese guard dog-embossed Shiba Inu (SHIB).2T SHIB Leaves KuCoin Amid Mounting Legal TroublesAmong a flurry of hefty whale transactions, a gargantuan 2 trillion Shiba Inu (SHIB) transfer was seen by Whale Alert. The 2T SHIB transfer immediately raised eyebrows in X, as cryptocurrency traders witnessed a $62,232,000 SHIB transfer on-chain.Surprisingly, this transaction wasn’t attributed to cryptocurrency whales relocating their crypto stashes due to fear and uncertainty. On the contrary, the cryptocurrency address is tied to KuCoin’s platform, as it’s labeled ‘KuCoin 20’ on EtherScan blockchain explorer.



Further investigation by DailyCoin showed that Shiba Inu is the second largest asset in the ‘KuCoin 20’ account. Worth $63,109,626 at the time of publication, the only larger crypto assets in this hot wallet are over $100 million of KuCoin’s KCS token.On the Flipside
The 2T Shiba Inu transfer amounts to up to 59% of KuCoin’s total 3.37T SHIB reserves.



Most cryptocurrency exchanges tend to shift massive amounts of reserves for maintenance.
Why This MattersKuCoin is the fourth-largest cryptocurrency exchange globally, with nearly 10 million monthly visitors. The criminal charges against the platform’s co-founders resembled last year’s, when the DoJ fined Binance $4.3 billion for similar offenses.Read DailyCoin’s trending crypto stories:

SEC Is Correct in Bashing Coinbase, Max Keiser Claims, Slamming XRP and ETH

Bitcoin evangelist and financial journalist Max Keiser has commented on the recent news of the court rejecting Coinbase’s request to drop the SEC suit against them. The only achievement of the exchange’s legal team here is that the court agreed to exclude the Coinbase Wallet from the list of subjects of the SEC’s lawsuit. Keiser supports SEC against Coinbase and altcoinsKeiser tweeted that “SEC is right”, again reminding his army of followers that all cryptocurrencies except Bitcoin, are “unregistered securities”, including XRP and ETH.SEC is correct. Anything not #Bitcoin is an unregistered security, including ETH & XRPCoinbase was slammed with a legal action by the SEC in the summer last year for allegedly allowing users to trade unregistered securities. For the Securities and Exchange Commission all altcoins are considered securities and only Bitcoin and Ethereum have been proclaimed commodities. However, recently discussions again began rising inside the SEC about whether the second largest cryptocurrency Ethereum is a commodity indeed. All Bitcoin maximalists, including Max Keiser and Samson Mow, believe ETH to be a security, a heavily centralized crypto.As for XRP, the case of the SEC against Ripple about this coin has been going since December 2020. Last year, Ripple scored a major victory in mid-summer, when the federal judge ruled that XRP sales on the secondary markets do not qualify as securities sales. The regulator also dropped charges against Ripple cofounder Chris Larsen and the company’s chief executive Brad Garlinghouse.In the latest, development, the SEC demands that Ripple pays $2 billion in remedies to them to cover all the fines and damages caused.

Ripple Legal Saga: Pro-XRP Lawyer Challenges SEC Allegations, Raises Validity Concerns - Coin Edition


							

Pro-XRP lawyer Bill Morgan questions SEC’s allegations, citing lack of evidence and validity.



SEC claims Ripple’s discounts caused $480 million in harm to investors, stirring legal tensions.



Concerns mount over Ripple’s reputation and compliance amidst regulatory scrutiny and legal battles.




In the ongoing legal saga between Ripple and the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), Pro-XRP lawyer, Bill Morgan, has stepped forward to provide insights into the potential impact of the regulatory body’s recent allegations. As tensions continue to rise, Morgan’s analysis sheds light on the challenges Ripple faces through legal scrutiny.







Morgan’s comments revolve around the SEC’s accusations aimed at Ripple, particularly concerning the crypto firm’s ‘alleged’ preferential treatment towards institutional investors.



Source: Bill Morgan



The SEC’s latest brief alleges that such preferential discounts given by Ripple could have resulted in harm amounting to a staggering $480 million for investors left out of these arrangements. 



Morgan has expressed reservations about the stance taken by the SEC. He believes that it is necessary to scrutinize the evidence behind the allegations and questions the validity of the SEC’s assertions. He highlights the apparent lack of evidence regarding the causation of the alleged wrongdoing. 



Morgan is also concerned about the potential damage to Ripple’s reputation among institutional investors. The revelation of selective discounts raises questions about the company’s compliance with regulatory standards, particularly regarding disclosure requirements. Such issues could further complicate Ripple’s legal proceedings and erode investor trust in the company.



The SEC has escalated its efforts by appealing to Judge Torres for a final judgment against Ripple. The regulatory agency is seeking a range of punitive measures, including permanent injunctions, disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and civil penalties totaling nearly $2 billion.

Samsung tops Apple in AI smartphone race with Galaxy AI updates

Samsung’s free-for-now AI smartphone features will get an update on Thursday, putting the South Korean electronics giant even further ahead of Apple in the race to bring generative AI to cell phones.Is Bitcoin a good speculative investment?Samsung first launched Galaxy AI on its Galaxy S24 smartphone in January. The AI software (which leverages Google’s AI chatbot Gemini) offers live translation when users make phone calls, so they can select the language they’re speaking and the language they want their voice to be translated to in real time. There’s also AI photo editing capabilities and “circle to search,” which lets people quickly look up information about an element within a picture. Now the AI features, which come at no cost until 2025, will be available on more Samsung phones — the S23 series, S23 FE, Z Flip 5, and Z Fold 5.Google was the first to debut a smartphone with AI tools with the Pixel 8 Pro in December. But Apple has yet to release an iPhone powered by AI features. The tech giant is reportedly in talks with Google parent Alphabet to use Gemini for iPhones, and it’s also considered leveraging OpenAI’s model. Apple also quietly acquired the Canadian startup DarwinAI earlier this year as it prepares to launch iOS 18 (probably in September) with generative AI features.Apple’s AI push comes as it’s falling behind in the smartphone market. iPhone sales fell 24% year-over-year in China to start 2024.Bank of America analyst Wamsi Mohan noted  the muted sentiment for Apple during a recent visit to China to meet with supply chain company executives. “This is the first trip over approximately 20 years we have been doing this where smartphones were barely a part of the conversation,” Mohan wrote in an email to investors Wednesday.Apple is facing other challenges, too. The company is being sued by the Department of Justice for allegedly violating antitrust law, and it’s getting investigated by the European Union over similar concerns about allegedly anticompetitive practices. Not to mention the company shuttering its electric vehicle project and its stock underperforming other tech giants in the so-called Magnificent Seven. It’s safe to say Apple has had a rough 2024 so far. A push into AI could give it a boost.

Bitcoin Miner Sued Over Pollution Despite Cleanup Claim - DailyCoin


        
A Pennsylvanian community group sues Bitcoin miner Stronghold Digital Mining.



The community group alleges environmental damage caused by the mining process.



Stronghold claims its activities are helping the local environment. 
The environmental toll of Bitcoin mining continues to be a flashpoint, with critics denouncing the crypto industry’s intensive use of fossil fuels and wasteful draw on electricity supply. This debate is playing out in Pennsylvania, where a community group called Save Carbon County has sued Bitcoin miner Stronghold Digital Mining over claims the firm is polluting the local environment. Yet, Stronghold insists its operations are cleaning up the local area.Bitcoin Miner Stronghold Digital in Legal Hot WaterIn a blow to Bitcoin mining, Save Carbon County has filed a lawsuit against Stronghold Digital, alleging the company’s mining operation is polluting nearby communities by burning waste coal and old tires to power the energy-intensive mining process and releasing mercury into the local waterways.The community group is seeking compensation and punitive damages from the company, as well as a court order to stop the alleged pollution.The lawsuit also names Pennsylvania as a defendant, along with related entities, including the state governor, Josh Shapiro, on the basis that the co-defendants are complicit in violating the state’s constitutional duty to protect the environment by enabling Stronghold Digital’s activities through issued permits and tax incentives.Stronghold Digital stated that its facilities clean up land and water using coal waste from historic mining in the region. The company claimed to have reclaimed over 1,050 acres of formerly blighted land.



This latest case has reignited the debate on Bitcoin mining’s environmental impact. Still, industry groups including the Bitcoin Mining Council (BMC) argue that proof-of-work mining creates an inconsequential impact.BTC Mining Has Minimal Environmental ImpactThe BMC continues to contend that Bitcoin mining is not as environmentally damaging as critics claim. In its latest report for the first half of 2023, the council stated that the Bitcoin network is using 59.9% sustainable energy sources, up from 58.9% in the previous period covering Q4 2022.On the matter of wasteful electricity usage, the BMC claimed the Bitcoin network used just 0.21% of global energy in the first half of 2023, a slight increase from 0.17% in Q4 2022. The council argued that this demonstrates Bitcoin’s minimal burden on worldwide power grids.



The BMC consists of independent Bitcoin miners who voluntarily share their operational data to increase transparency in the mining industry. The organization aims to educate the public on the benefits of BTC mining.On the Flipside
The BMC‘s membership represents a fraction of global miners, meaning its data may be unrepresentative.



Proponents of energy-intensive proof-of-work mining claim it is superior to proof-of-stake as it is more decentralized, and more secure due to the prohibitive cost of attacking a proof-of-work system.
Why This MattersWhile crypto proponents may tout economic opportunities as a result of Bitcoin mining, this case lays bare the tension between those financial incentives and environmental costs. A ruling favoring the community group could encourage more challenges against miners operating in residential areas and spur tighter regulations around emissions and energy sources.The Biden administration pushes energy tax to curb Bitcoin mining activity.

Is KuCoin The Next FTX? CryptoQuant's CEO Has The Answer


								On Tuesday, the US Department of Justice announced criminal charges against the global crypto exchange KuCoin and two of its founders, Chun Gan (also known as “Michael”) and Ke Tang (also known as “Eric”). The charges, related to conspiring to operate an unlicensed money transmitting business and violations of the Bank Secrecy Act, have stirred concerns among users and investors about the future of the Seychelles-based exchange, echoing fears reminiscent of the FTX collapse.
Is KuCoin The Next FTX?
According to the official press release by the Southern District of New York, the indictment accuses KuCoin and its founders of deliberately failing to implement an adequate anti-money laundering (AML) program. This negligence allegedly facilitated the use of the platform for money laundering and terrorist financing activities.
Moreover, the exchange is accused of not maintaining necessary procedures to verify customer identities and failing to report any suspicious activities.

Despite these serious allegations, CryptoQuant CEO Ki Young Ju provided a contrasting view, focusing on the exchange’s operational and financial stability. Through a statement on X, Ju highlighted that, from an on-chain perspective, KuCoin’s Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) reserves seem unaffected by the surge in withdrawals, primarily by retail users.
Ju remarked, “On-chain wise, Kucoin is fine. BTC and ETH withdrawals surged, driven mainly by retail users, with a small impact on the overall reserve. They appear to not commingle customers’ funds and have sufficient reserves to process user withdrawals.”

This reassurance comes at a crucial time when the memory of FTX’s downfall, triggered by liquidity issues and allegations of misusing customer funds, still lingers in the minds of the crypto community. Ju made a clear distinction between the reserve management practices of KuCoin and FTX, underscoring the organic nature of KuCoin’s BTC and ETH reserves in contrast to the problematic handling of funds by FTX.
“Kucoin’s BTC and ETH reserves appear organic, unlike those of FTX. They don’t commingle customers’ funds,” Ju stated and shared the Bitcoin and Ethereum exchange reserves charts by CryptoQuant.

Ju contrasted these charts with the one’s from FTX, noting “Here are FTX reserves for comparison. FTX commingled customers’ funds with their funds; you can see a lot of bulk deposits/withdrawals in the charts. It doesn’t look organic.”

As of now, KuCoin hold 5.949 BTC and 99.358 ETH, according to CryptoQuant’s data. The total balance of KuCoin’s portfolio across multiple chains is valued at $4.764 billion, according to Scopescan data.
At press time, the KuCoin token (KCS) traded at $11.42, down -20% since the news broke.

El Salvador Adds to Bitcoin Stash, Now Holds Nearly $400 Million in ‘Digital Gold’ - Decrypt

El Salvador’s Bitcoin-loving leader Nayib Bukele has added to the country’s crypto holdings, which have swelled to almost $400 million in virtual currency.In a Monday Twitter post, the popular President showed off an address holding over 5,695 BTC. At today’s prices, that would mean the country holds over $391 million in digital coins. President Bukele’s administration was previously opaque about its Bitcoin buys. The leader would post on Twitter when he would buy the asset—even boasting that he’d snap it up naked or “in the toilet”—but exact figures could not be obtained from the government’s press office or website. He then said on the platform in 2022 that the country would buy 1 BTC every day. Earlier this month, he announced that the country had moved a “big chunk” of its holdings to cold storage, and revealed a crypto wallet address in the process.President Bukele’s idea to put Bitcoin in the government’s coffers came after he announced that the asset would be made legal tender back in 2021—alongside the U.S. dollar. The policy was criticized by the IMF and U.S. politicians but the eccentric leader carried on with the plan.  Despite El Salvador’s Bitcoin law, which asks businesses to accept BTC if they have the means to do so, Decrypt found during a 2021 visit that Salvadorans weren’t using the asset much at all to buy things. Subsequent studies and polls confirmed that citizens in the tiny country weren’t crypto crazy, either. But Bukele is still wildly popular with Salvadorans after having cleaned up the country’s once sky-high crime rate. Human rights activists have argued that it has come at a cost, though, and that Salvadoran authorities have allegedly hurt innocent people in a massive gang crackdown that has imprisoned 1% of the population. Bukele nonetheless won reelection in February by a huge landslide. Edited by Ryan Ozawa.Stay on top of crypto news, get daily updates in your inbox.

Ethereum Designated As Commodity By CFTC, Triggering Regulatory Conflict With SEC | Bitcoinist.com


								A recent development highlights the ongoing interagency drama between the US Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) and the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC): the classification of major cryptocurrencies has become a focal point of contention. 
Once again, the CFTC has affirmed its position that Ethereum (ETH) and several other cryptocurrencies should be classified as commodities, intensifying the battle for regulatory oversight in the expansive digital assets industry.
Regulatory Rift With SEC Over Bitcoin, Ethereum, And Litecoin Classification
The latest episode in this regulatory feud unfolded with the CFTC filing a complaint against the crypto exchange KuCoin, coinciding with the unsealing of an indictment by the US Department of Justice (DOJ) against KuCoin and its founders, Chun Gan and Ke Tang. 
The CFTC’s complaint alleged that KuCoin engaged in illegal off-exchange commodity futures transactions and leveraged, margined, or financed retail commodity transactions. 
Furthermore, the exchange was accused of operating without the necessary registrations, failing to supervise its activities diligently, and neglecting to implement an effective customer identification program.

However, the most striking aspect of the complaint lies in the CFTC’s assertion that KuCoin facilitated trading involving digital assets such as Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), and Litecoin (LTC), recognizing them as commodities. 
An excerpt of the CFTC complaint highlights Ethereum as a commodity. Source: Jake Chervinsky on X
This starkly contrasts with the SEC’s current stance, championed by Chair Gary Gensler, which suggests that only Bitcoin holds the commodity classification, leaving other cryptocurrencies outside this designation, including Ethereum.
This ongoing turf war over cryptocurrency classification has a history, as evidenced by the CFTC’s previous lawsuit against Binance last year, where Ethereum and Litecoin were also deemed commodities. 
Legal Experts Suggest Turf War Over Crypto Jurisdiction
The discrepancies between the two regulatory bodies have sparked debate within the industry, with legal experts such as Jake Chervinsky, Chief Legal Officer at venture capital firm Variant, interpreting the CFTC’s position as a challenge to the SEC’s authority. 
Chervinsky suggests that the CFTC’s message to the SEC is that numerous digital assets should be regarded as commodities, indicating that the cryptocurrency space is within the jurisdiction of both agencies, even if the CFTC’s approach is less vocal. Chervinsky’s statement further reads:
Usually, the SEC and CFTC pretend they aren’t in a turf war over crypto. Today the CFTC is openly attacking the SEC’s supposed investigation of ETH. This may seem minor, but is actually pretty savage interagency drama by DC standards… I read it as CFTC saying to SEC ~ a ton of other digital assets are commodities too and you’re not the only one who gets to judge them; this space belongs to us just as much as you, even if we aren’t as loud about it.

As the CFTC and SEC clash intensifies, the industry awaits further developments and official rulings that will shape the regulatory landscape for cryptocurrencies and their respective classifications.

At the time of writing, the price of ETH stands at $3,543, experiencing a slight 0.6% decline in the past 24 hours. This follows a notable 5% rebound over the past seven days.

Russia’s finance minister stresses the importance of crypto regulation 1

Russia’s finance minister Anton Siluanov recently discussed the issues surrounding crypto regulation and its usage across the country. The minister, at a lecture, talked about the need to drum up regulations that will help the sector thrive. He also talked about regulators and the issues they are facing in the industry.Russia’s finance minister drums up the need for crypto regulationAlthough the minister’s stance when it comes to crypto mining in the country is firm, he is being opposed by the Central Bank of Russia over the absence of regulatory oversight of the assets in the country. The bank’s stance is not new, because it has been against legalizing the use of digital assets citing various issues about control.Despite being opposed when it comes to domestic circulation, Siluanov talked about his openness to using mined digital assets to settle international payments. He also talked about the importance of collaborating with the central bank to come up with rules for the assets.The topic of cryptocurrency regulation in Russia has been a subject of deliberation for several years. Siluanov’s intention to engage with central bank officials highlights the government’s dedication to devising a balanced approach that considers both the opportunities and risks associated with cryptocurrencies.Russian President Vladimir Putin’s endorsement of digital currencies introduces another dimension to this discourse. Since 2022, Putin has advocated for leveraging digital currencies for international payments, showcasing a strategic interest in harnessing blockchain technology for financial transactions.A clear approach to crypto and international transactionsThis alignment with digital currencies mirrors Russia’s broader initiatives in the fintech arena. According to the Skolkovo Fintech Hub, a state-run entity, Russian miners generated substantial amounts of cryptocurrencies in 2022, underscoring the burgeoning economic impact of cryptocurrency mining activities in the country.The recent enactment of a law by President Putin to regulate the utilization of digital currencies for international payments signifies a step forward in establishing clarity and legal frameworks for such transactions. Nonetheless, discussions regarding the domestic use and circulation of cryptocurrencies remain intricate and necessitate meticulous consideration of regulatory implications.Siluanov’s statements epitomize the ongoing endeavors to navigate these intricate challenges. He emphasized the necessity of defining the permissible and impermissible uses of mined cryptocurrencies, particularly in the realm of domestic and international payments. This nuanced approach acknowledges the potential advantages of digital currencies for cross-border transactions while also addressing concerns surrounding regulatory oversight and control.Anton Siluanov’s commentary underscores the evolving landscape of cryptocurrency regulation in Russia. As discussions persist and regulatory frameworks evolve, striking a balance between harnessing the benefits of digital currencies and mitigating associated risks will be imperative for Russia’s financial ecosystem.

Dormant Bitcoins on the Move: An Unexpected Boon for BTC? - DailyCoin


        
Old Bitcoin holdings have been consolidated and moved, sparking talks of strategic asset repositioning.



The Bitcoin halving event is approaching and has historically been linked to price increases.



This recent Bitcoin movement has followed prior instances of dormant BTC being awakened.
The Bitcoin market has witnessed a flurry of activity recently, with large sums of the cryptocurrency changing hands. These movements have sparked discussions among analysts about a potential “sell-side liquidity crisis” brewing in the digital asset space.Bitcoin Consolidation Sparks Talk of Sell-OffOne particularly noteworthy transaction involved the consolidation of 2,000 Bitcoin, mined in 2010, into a single wallet. Developer Mononautical identified this activity, suggesting the coins may have been sold via an over-the-counter (OTC) trade. Ki Young Ju, CEO of crypto analytics firm CryptoQuant, believes this movement signifies a “sell-side liquidity crisis waking up old Bitcoin.”A sell-side liquidity crisis occurs when there’s a shortage of sellers willing to part with their assets. This scarcity can make it difficult for buyers to find sellers at their desired price points, potentially leading to price volatility.The recent consolidation comes amidst heightened anticipation surrounding the upcoming Bitcoin halving event, expected around 21 April 2024. This pre-programmed mechanism in Bitcoin’s code reduces the block reward for miners by half, effectively limiting the new Bitcoin entering circulation. This event historically coincides with price appreciation for Bitcoin.Recent Activity Has Analysts DividedAdding to the intrigue, another significant transfer occurred over the weekend. The fifth-wealthiest Bitcoin address, which held 94,500 since 2019, fragmented its holdings and sent them to three separate addresses. The purpose and plans for these transferred Bitcoins remain unclear.These large-scale movements follow an incident in January where an individual seemingly sent 26.9 Bitcoin to the irretrievable Bitcoin Genesis wallet, the first-ever wallet on the network. Additionally, in July 2023, a dormant wallet containing over 1,000 Bitcoin, inactive for eleven years, suddenly transferred its entire holdings.



While the exact motivations behind these recent Bitcoin movements remain to be seen, they collectively paint a picture of increased activity within the long-dormant segments of the cryptocurrency market. Whether this signifies a coming sell-off or a strategic repositioning of assets in anticipation of the halving event remains a topic of debate among analysts.On the Flipside
The consolidation of old Bitcoins could indicate renewed interest from early adopters, potentially bringing fresh investment to the market.



A sell-side liquidity crisis, if it occurs, can lead to price volatility as buyers might have to offer more to entice sellers or struggle to find sellers at all.
Why This MattersThe awakening of long-dormant Bitcoins and the upcoming halving injects uncertainty into the market. This uncertainty could trigger price volatility as analysts debate whether these movements foreshadow a potential sell-off or a pre-halving strategic play, impacting not just Bitcoin but potentially the broader cryptocurrency market.Curious about a large Bitcoin wallet that recently moved for the first time in four years?

OKX API glitch leads to incorrect account balances, causing confusion among thousands of users.
                        The OKX API has recently been plagued by a technical glitch that has left users in Singapore, Japan, and the United States with incorrect account balances.According to reports on the OKX Telegram, affected users have experienced a range of issues, from accounts displaying zero balances to others showing balances skyrocketing into the tens of millions.The widespread nature of the OKX API glitch has caused major frustration among traders, who have reported losses due to their inability to access or close positions.OKX Acknowledges Rest API Issues and Reassures Users
In response to the numerous user complaints, OKX has acknowledged the issues with their Rest API, which facilitates connections to external services through standard HTTP requests.The Rest API experienced a crash during this time, leading to errors, incorrect data, and failures when attempting to execute trades.OKX has reassured users that their engineering team is actively working to resolve the API glitch and has emphasized the safety of user assets throughout the incident.The exchange has also stated that their WebSocket, app, and website remain unaffected by the glitch.Despite these assurances, the OKX API glitch has had repercussions on the exchange’s native token, OKB, causing a 2.21% decline in its value to $64.59 as of writing.Recent Developments and Glitches in the Crypto Space
Prior to the current OKX API glitch, the exchange had recently integrated Uniswap Labs’ application programming interface (API) into its decentralized exchange (DEX) to allow gas-free trading through a feature called “Snap.”This feature was intended to simplify decentralized token swapping and provide direct connection with Uniswap, granting the OKX DEX access to the UniswapX protocol and its liquidity.However, the OKX API glitch is not an isolated incident in the crypto space. In recent weeks, platforms such as Coinbase and Solana have also been affected by outages and glitches.Solana experienced a nearly 5-hour outage in early February, wherein block production abruptly ceased. The issue was traced back to an infinite recompile loop triggered by a legacy loader program within the JIT cache, necessitating a network upgrade and restart by validator operators.Coinbase, meanwhile, encountered an outage that led to a $100 billion loss in Bitcoin market cap within just 15 minutes in late February. The disruption occurred during a period of substantial rally in Bitcoin prices, with CEO Brian Armstrong attributing the outage to unexpectedly high demand.

KuCoin plans $10M airdrop of BTC, KCS as Justice Dept., CFTC circle

Cryptocurrency exchange KuCoin will hold an airdrop of Bitcoin (BTC) and its native KuCoin (KCS) token worth $10 million, according to a letter from CEO Johnny Lyu posted on the exchange’s blog on March 27. The news comes a day after the United States Justice Department announced charges against the exchange and two of  its founders.Lyu did not mention the federal charges, although he alluded to them in the first sentence of his letter:“I would like to express my gratitude to all KuCoin users, for your support, trust and companionship during the past few days.”Comparing the airdrop to the exchange’s reimbursement of its investors who lost money in the Confido rug pull, Lyu continued:“Recently, on March 26th and 27th, some users experienced longer-than-expected wait times during the withdrawal process. […] To express our profound gratitude for your support and patience KuCoin will launch a special airdrop event totaling 10 million USD in KCS and BTC.”Rules for the airdrop will be released in three days, Lyu wrote. The recent delays in withdrawals were possibly caused by the high volume as wary customers abandoned the exchange. The airdrop thus rewards users who remained loyal to the exchange in its time of crisis.Related: KuCoin agrees to ban New York residents and pay $22 million settlementThe timing of the airdrop is noteworthy since KuCoin was hit with a barrage of legal actions one day earlier. The Justice Department unsealed an indictment for violations of the Bank Secrecy Act for lacking an Anti-Money Laundering program by the two founders and operating an unlicensed money-transmitting business. Simultaneously, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) initiated a civil case against the exchange for violations of the Commodity Exchange Act and CFTC regulations.Source: Wu BlockchainKuCoin hastened to assure users that their assets were safe after the charges were filed and KCS fell 12% in 24 hours. Airdrops come with risks, not the least of which is the possibility of regulatory action. The SEC wrote in its document “Framework for “Investment Contract” Analysis of Digital Assets”: “The lack of monetary consideration for digital assets, such as those distributed via a so-called ‘air drop,’ does not mean that the investment of money prong [of the Howey test] is not satisfied; therefore, an airdrop may constitute a sale or distribution of securities.” The DeFi Education Fund teamed up with a small Texas clothing company sued for a declaratory judgment against the SEC to prevent the agency from prosecuting the company for holding an airdrop.Magazine: Cool green mayor giving a grand in Bitcoin to each resident

Binance to End Support for TRC-20 USDC Tokens Following Circle's Withdrawal from Tron Network



                    
Binance, the leading cryptocurrency exchange, is set to discontinue the support for deposits and withdrawals of USD Coin (USDC) tokens based on the TRC-20 protocol from the Tron blockchain, effective April 5. 



This decision follows an announcement on February 20 by Circle, the issuer of USDC, regarding its move to halt the support for the stablecoin on the Tron network. 




Circle’s choice is part of a broader strategy to maintain USDC’s reliability, transparency, and security. Alongside ceasing its support, 



Circle also ceased the minting of USDC on Tron’s blockchain on the same date, with a plan to fully phase out its involvement with this network.



The impact of Circle’s decision extended to Binance, which, due to its significant trading volume, plays a crucial role in the cryptocurrency market. 




Binance’s announcement to end TRC-20 USDC support came on March 25, providing a 12-day window for users to manage their assets accordingly. 



Although Binance will stop facilitating deposits and withdrawals of TRC-20 USDC tokens, the platform will continue to support USDC trading activities beyond the cut-off date. 



It’s important to note that this change will not affect USDC transactions over other blockchains supported by Binance, and the decision has garnered positive feedback within the crypto community on social media platform X.



Circle has not explicitly stated why it chose to withdraw support for Tron, mentioning only a continuous evaluation of blockchain platforms within its risk management strategy.

In response to these developments, a Tron representative expressed to Cointelegraph that the blockchain was left in the dark about the specifics behind Circle’s decision and was not notified prior to the public announcement.



Amidst these changes, Tron is exploring innovative approaches to maintain its relevance and utility within the cryptocurrency ecosystem. 



Notably, Tron’s founder, Justin Sun, has shared plans to implement a Bitcoin layer-2 solution aimed at introducing a “wrapped” version of Tether to the network. 



This initiative is expected to bridge Tron directly with Bitcoin, potentially unlocking access to over $55 billion in Bitcoin network value. 



Sun’s announcement outlines a roadmap for integrating stablecoins and tokens between Tron and Bitcoin, which could significantly enhance Bitcoin’s financial ecosystem.

Gurbacs shared his dissatisfaction in an X post, as he highlighted the extent of the limitation of innovations and the negative economic outlook caused by ineffective regulatory frameworks by relevant authorities.The shared concern by the VanEck advisor came shortly after the SEC announced the delay in VanEck’s spot Ether ETF application on March 20.Gurbacs also drew attention to the rise of scammers in the blockchain sector, which has become a hotbed for fraud.His observation aligns with Chainalysis 2024 crypto crime report data, which disclosed that illicit crypto addresses received $24.2 billion in 2023.Additionally, the advisor noted that while there are a few exceptions to his criticism, regulators must provide and implement new structures to build tomorrow’s markets.“It’s not excusable or tolerable to prioritize personal/political interests and senseless bureaucracy over national interests and capital formation,” he said. “Not ever but particularly not in the economic condition where the world is now.”Meanwhile, two events corroborating Gubarcs’ concerns include the DoJ indictment against the KuCoin exchange and the SEC settlement with Binance.Federal prosecutors in Manhattan had on March 26 charged KuCoin and two of its founders, Chun Gan and Ke Tang, over an alleged violation of the US anti-money laundering (AML) laws and for operating an unlicensed money transmitting business.Some analysts and market players believe the fresh lawsuit will probably result in a huge settlement as it did for Binance.It could be recalled that the SEC had charged Binance for multiple offenses like fraud, AML violation, sales of unregistered assets, and more in 2023 before the exchange was slammed with a federal resolution charge of $4 billion. However, it should be noted that Binance is not the crypto exchange in the eye of the storm of the SEC – Coinbase was sued a day after Binance.While Federal charge settlements seem to be a fair penalty for large firms, the VanEck advisor believes that the existing crypto regulations are biased.VanEck Joins Others in Waitlist for SEC’s Greenlight
SEC’s delayed announcement of VanEck’s spot Ether ETF proposal puts the asset manager on a waitlist that includes Grayscale, Fidelity, BlackRock, Ark 21 shares, Hashdex Nasdaq Ethereum ETF, and the Invesco Galaxy Ethereum ETF.Experts believe these postponements indicate a trend of caution by the SEC in approving crypto-based ETFs.The speculation surrounding the decision on a spot Ethereum ETF has been a topic of contention. Recent optimism about crypto ETFs has diminished, however, with Bloomberg ETF analyst Eric Balchunas revising his prior forecasts of the possibility of approval by May 23 to become uncertain.Meanwhile, a local news report suggested that the US regulatory agency plans to classify ETH as a security and has issued subpoenas to three companies to investigate the Ethereum Foundation, the entity behind the Ethereum blockchain network.While the SEC had previously approved 11 Bitcoin ETFs earlier this year, Ethereum ETFs may encounter regulatory obstacles.Regardless, VanEck and other participants wait patiently for the Ethereum ETF green light, similar to Bitcoin ETFs, which has an impressive record of $57B in on-chain holdings, representing 4.17% of the current BTC supply.

Coinbase Increases USDC Reserves as TVL Surpasses $1 Billion - DailyCoin


        
Coinbase has begun storing more USDC on Base to enable faster transactions and lower fees.



The USDC landscape has changed as Circle has halted issuance on the Tron blockchain.



Binance has delisted Tron-based USDC deposits and withdrawals, although USDC trading remains unaffected.
In a move aimed at streamlining customer fund management, Coinbase announced plans to increase its storage of USDC, a popular stablecoin, on Base. This Ethereum Layer 2 solution, built by Coinbase and powered by the OP Stack, promises significant advantages including lower fees, faster transaction times, and enhanced security.Coinbase Leverages Base Layer 2 Max Branzburg, Coinbase’s Vice President and Head of Consumer Products, revealed the decision, highlighting user benefits. He encouraged other companies to adopt a similar approach and transition their business on-chain."This enables us to manage and secure customer funds with lower fees and faster settlement times, with no impact to the Coinbase user experience," he stated in a recent post.He further encouraged other companies to adopt a similar approach and transition their business on-chain. The crypto community has responded positively to the announcement. Jesse Pollak, a contributor to Base, expressed his support and excitement for Coinbase’s move. He described the decision as “based” and pledged continued assistance for Coinbase’s on-chain endeavors. This development comes amidst a period of rapid growth for Base. According to Defi Llama, user deposits on the platform have surpassed a staggering $1 billion, doubling since the beginning of March. This surge is largely attributed to the decentralized exchange Aerodrome, which has contributed a significant portion of the locked value since its rise in February. Additionally, Base has witnessed a notable increase in transaction counts, surpassing other optimistic rollup solutions in growth.Circle Announces Changes to Token CreationMeanwhile, the landscape surrounding USDC is undergoing further changes. Boston-based Circle, the firm behind USDC, has announced plans to discontinue the creation of USDC tokens on the Tron blockchain. 



Citing a focus on transparency, trustworthiness, and safety, Circle stated that the decision stemmed from a company-wide evaluation. This move was followed by a similar announcement by Binance, which will no longer facilitate Tron-based USDC deposits and withdrawals.Importantly, Binance emphasized that USDC trading remains unaffected on its platform, and deposits and withdrawals through other supported networks will continue as usual. With a current circulation of approximately $32.1 billion, USDC remains the second-largest stablecoin globally after Tether and ranks as the seventh-largest cryptocurrency overall. While most USDC tokens reside on the Ethereum blockchain, Coinbase’s decision to leverage Base for its USDC reserves signifies a potential shift towards a more efficient and secure future for the stablecoin.On the Flipside
While Base promises security, Layer 2 solutions inherently introduce additional security risks compared to the base layer (Ethereum in this case).



Coinbase storing a significant amount of USDC on Base, a network they built, raises centralization concerns.
Why This MattersCoinbase’s move to store USDC on Base, an Ethereum Layer 2 solution, could set a precedent for wider adoption of Layer 2 technologies. This shift can potentially improve transaction speeds, reduce fees, and enhance security for USDC and other cryptocurrencies within the Ethereum ecosystem.

Fidelity Makes a New Ethereum Spot ETF Move - Bloomberg ETF Analyst Reveals Likelihood of ETFs Approval - Bitcoin Sistemi

According to recent SEC filings, Fidelity has filed a Form S-1 for its spot Ethereum ETF, which also includes staking.
Fidelity has filed an S-1 for its Ethereum ETF, Bloomberg analyst James Seyffart confirmed. “This is not a change; this is the company's first application. They had only filed 19b-4 to date,” Seyffart said.


Despite this development, Seyffart remains skeptical about the ETF's approval. “That doesn't change our view right now. We still think we're likely to see rejection in May,” he added.
According to Seyffart, the chances of spot Ethereum ETFs being approved in May are decreasing. Seyffart cited U.S. regulators' lack of engagement with potential issuers on the products as a contributing factor to the rejection. “We now believe these products will be ultimately rejected for this round on May 23,” the analyst wrote in an earlier post. He and his colleague Eric Balchunas had previously given a 35% chance of approval in May.






The US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) had previously postponed a decision regarding spot ETH ETFs. However, he will have to make a decision by May 23 as it is the deadline for one of the applicants.
Form S-1 SEC is the initial registration form required by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) for new securities for public companies incorporated in the United States. Any securities that meet the criteria must file an S-1 before the shares can be listed on a national exchange, such as the New York Stock Exchange.


Currently, seven companies plan to launch an Ethereum fund: BlackRock, Fidelity, Galaxy with Invesco, Grayscale, VanEck, Ark with 21Shares, and Hashdex.

Bitcoin Cash (BCH) Price Could Drop to $400 - Here's Why


Bitcoin Cash (BCH) price is making another attempt at breaching the year-to-date high, although, by the looks of it, this may not happen.
Multiple reasons are contributing to the bearish anticipation, but this could be turned around if BCH flips a crucial level into support.
Bitcoin Cash Whales Signal Drawdown
Bitcoin Cash price will potentially bear the impact of the bearishness exhibited by the whales. These large wallet investors tend to sway the direction of the price action. Historically, their selling has induced corrections, while accumulation has resulted in rallies.
This time around, the outcome is expected to be bearish since the addresses hodling between 1,000 to 10,000 BCH have been consistently selling since March began. Nearly 50,000 BCH worth over $25 million were sold in the last week alone.

However, since the price kept going upward, the altcoin is now due for a correction.
Read More: Bitcoin Cash (BCH) Price Prediction 2024/2025/2030
As a matter of fact, even retail investors are going to sell their holdings now. The Market Value signals this to the Realized Value (MVRV) ratio. The MVRV ratio measures investors’ profit/loss.
Bitcoin Cash’s 30-day MVRV at 10% signals profit, potentially prompting selling. Historically, BCH corrections have occurred when the indicator is between 7%-17% MVRV, labeled a danger zone.

Thus, BCH is vulnerable to corrections due to selling, which could occur at any time.
BCH Price Prediction: What to Expect?
If selling begins, Bitcoin Cash price will likely fail in testing the $501 resistance as support, even if it does manage to breach it. A decline to $448 will result in BCH losing the 50-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA).
Falling through this support will result in a drop to $400 or $378, which marks the confluence of the 100-day EMA.

However, the altcoin could invalidate the bearish thesis if the breach and testing of $501 as support be successful. BCH would then be open to rising towards $520.

Tether's Dark Crown: Most Used Stablecoin In Illicit Crypto Transactions, Reports TRM


								While Tether (USDT), the world’s leading stablecoin, has been pivotal in facilitating transactions across the blockchain space, a recent analysis by blockchain analytics firm TRM Labs sheds light on a less desirable aspect of USDT’s ubiquity: its significant use within illicit crypto flows during the past year.
This development unfolds against declining overall volumes of illegal transactions in the crypto sector, a trend attributed to heightened sanctions and regulatory actions against various entities within the ecosystem.

At the Heart Of Illicit Crypto Transactions?
According to TRM Labs’ review, Tether accounted for $19.3 billion of the illicit transaction volume in 2023, marking a decrease from $24.7 billion in the preceding year. Despite this reduction, USDT remained the most utilized stablecoin for criminal purposes, including a notable dominance in terrorist financing activities.
TRM’s findings specifically highlight the use of USDT on the Tron blockchain, which hosts a “significant portion of Tether’s total volume,” as the preferred currency for terrorist financing entities. According to TRM, this blockchain saw a 125% increase in terror-financing-related addresses receiving USDT.
The analysis further breaks down the distribution of illicit flows across major blockchains. Tron was responsible for 45% of these flows, showing an increase from the previous year.
According to the report, the Ethereum and Bitcoin blockchains followed, facilitating 24% and 18% of the illegal transactions.
In comparison, the second-largest stablecoin, USDC, issued by Circle, was linked to a lower volume of illicit activity, totaling $428.9 million.
A Tether spokesperson said to Bloomberg in response to the TRM Labs report:
While we don’t have access to the report, historical evidence repeatedly shows that transactional figures have often been exaggerated due to a misinterpretation of data that assumes that if a service receives some small portion of illicit funds then all funds in the service are illicit, significantly inflating the actual values.
Notably, this shift in the landscape of illicit crypto transactions coincides with a broader trend of declining illegal fund volumes in the sector, which fell to $34.8 billion in 2023 from $49.5 billion the year before, as highlighted by TRM.
TRM Labs attributes this positive development partly to a “threefold increase in sanctions” and regulatory measures targeting “crypto-related businesses and individuals.”
Tether’s Efforts And Regulatory Scrutiny
Despite TRM’s claims in the report, Tether’s stance against the misuse of its stablecoin is worth noting. Last year, Tether collaborated with US authorities and the OKX crypto exchange to freeze $225 million of its stablecoin linked to a criminal syndicate.
Furthermore, last year, Tether faced criticism, including from the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime, which pointed out the popularity of stablecoin among money launderers and fraudsters, especially in the context of online gambling platforms.
In response to these criticisms, Tether defended its operations, emphasizing the “transparency” and “traceability” of transactions on public blockchains, which, according to Tether’s CEO, Paolo Ardoino, makes USDT an “impractical choice” for conducting illicit activities.

The company also expressed disappointment over assessments that focus solely on the negative uses of its stablecoin, arguing that such perspectives overlook USDT’s role in supporting developing economies in emerging markets.

UK Regulators Release Guidance for ‘Finfluencers’ and Memes Promoting Financial Products - The Daily Hodl


								Regulators in the United Kingdom are releasing new regulations for influencers and memes that promote financial products.
In a new press release, the UK’s Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) is giving out new guidelines on how social media can be used to promote financial products, including fintech and digital assets, as a means of combating fraud.










According to the FCA, in the future, influencers may not be allowed to promote financial products – including through memes – without the approval of an FCA-authorized person.
“The FCA has set out how adverts across social media channels must be fair, clear and not misleading, meaning they must have balance and carry the right risk warnings so people can make well informed financial decisions. Social media has become a central part of firms’ marketing strategies. 
Firms are on the hook for all their promotions and the FCA has warned they need to ensure influencers they work with communicate to their followers in the right way. 
And influencers are reminded that promoting a financial product without approval from an FCA-authorized person with the right permission could be a criminal offense.” 
Lucy Castledine, Director of Consumer Investments at the FCA, says in the press release that in 2023, regulators removed over 10,000 misleading advertisements alone.
“Any marketing for financial products must be fair, clear and not misleading so consumers can invest, save or borrow with confidence. Promotions aren’t just about the likes, they’re about the law. 
We will take action against those touting financial products illegally. Social media will not always be the best place to promote complex products. Firms need to consider whether a platform that offers limited characters or space is the right place to do so.”

UK Issues Guidance and Warning on Memecoins - Bitcoin Sistemi


The UK Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) is turning the regulatory spotlight on memecoin 'finfluencers' as it seeks to rein in memecoin-centric marketing for financial products.
The FCA has published guidelines for both financial services companies and social media influencers who create memecoins about cryptocurrencies or other investments. The regulator emphasizes that all marketing must be transparent and not misleading.


The FCA stated that 'finfluencers' must obtain approval from an FCA-appointed representative before advertising financial products and services or issuing memecoins. “Influencers are reminded that it may be a criminal offense to promote a financial product without the consent of an FCA authorized person with the correct consent,” the regulator wrote.
The FCA also urged consumers to be wary of questionable advertising and online scams. He stated that it is important for influencers to ensure they comply with the rules and consider the potential damage to their reputation if they are found to be promoting illegal products.






Lucy Castledine, the FCA's director of consumer investment, said the watchdog would “take action against those who promote financial products illegally”. The regulator noted that promotion through memecoins is particularly popular in the cryptocurrency industry, which has a dedicated memecoin space.
The FCA's latest warning comes after it stressed last month that it would take action against firms running illegal financial promotions. Last year, the agency issued 450 warnings as part of its enforcement efforts against illegal cryptocurrency advertising.

Apple wins antitrust suit over Venmo, Cash App fees after judge tosses case

United States District Judge Vince Chhabria dismissed an antitrust lawsuit brought against Apple by Venmo and Cash App customers over allegations the California company’s Apple Cash product was anti-competitive. The lawsuit, initially filed on Nov. 17, 2023, in San Jose, sought to hold Apple accountable for its perceived monopolistic practices involving the Apple iOS App Store. Per the complaint, Apple allegedly makes it difficult or impossible for competitors to the Apple Pay service to introduce desirable features such as integrating decentralized cryptocurrency payments into existing or new products and services. As such, the complainants allege that Venmo, CashApp, and other existing or new services are unable to introduce features that would lead to competitive pricing and improved functionality for iOS end users. Related: Apple sued for blocking crypto tech for P2P paymentsJudge Chhabria granted Apple’s motion for dismissal on March 26, 20. According to the case filing, the complaint suffered from “several fatal issues.”The filing goes on to state that the plaintiffs failed to establish what antitrust actions took place, nor did they establish why competitors such as Zelle weren’t included in the initial complaint. It also refers to the plaintiff’s suit as “speculative,” and outlines what the court perceives as a flawed premise. Essentially, the initial complaint alleges that Apple’s terms of service for products such as Venmo and Cash App to appear on the App Store prohibit those companies from including cryptocurrency features in their products. The judge’s ruling cites the relevant rule (Guideline 3.1.5 in the App Store T.O.S.) and dismisses its applicability in the suit.According to the filing:“Even assuming that Guideline 3.1.5 restricts decentralized cryptocurrency transactions (which seems doubtful), it is not clear how companies agreeing to a guideline outlining the Apple Store requirements for apps facilitating cryptocurrency transactions constitutes an unlawful agreement.”Going forward, the plaintiffs have 21 days from the date of the filing to submit amendments to the case that could compel the court to move forward with the lawsuit before the dismissal becomes record. However, the odds may not be in the plaintiff’s favor, given the tenor of the judge’s final remarks in the filing:“The plaintiffs should not assume that the defects mentioned in this ruling are the only ones in the complaint. Apple’s motion to dismiss has put them on notice of many more potential problems. Indeed, it is difficult to see how amendment could salvage this case. But, in an abundance of caution, the motion to dismiss is granted with leave to amend. If no amended complaint is filed within 21 days of this ruling, dismissal will be with prejudice.”

KuCoin Witnesses $1B In Withdrawals As Exchange Is Accused Of Money Laundering: 'SEC Trying To Protect Us From Making Money?' Questions Trader - Benzinga

Leading cryptocurrency exchange, KuCoin saw a massive $1 billion in crypto withdrawals over the past 24 hours, coinciding with a notable decrease in the exchange’s assets.What Happened: Arkham Intelligence data highlighted KuCoin exchange balance at $4.7 billion, down from more than $6 billion the prior day. This decline was attributed to a substantial amount of assets being withdrawn by investors amid allegations of money laundering against the exchange by the U.S. Department of Justice. U.S. Attorney Damian Williams stated, "KuCoin allegedly deliberately chose not to implement even basic anti-money laundering policies."The accused crypto exchange KuCoin witnessed around $1 billion in crypto withdrawals over the past 24 hours and assets under management plunged 20% amid the exchange facing charges from U.S. authorities, as reported by CoinDesk citing Nansen and Arkham Intelligence data.  Amidst many loopholes in the functioning of cryptocurrency exchange, Benzinga’s Future of Digital Assets conference, scheduled for Nov. 19, will bring industry leaders and investors together to discuss the future of digital asset investments.Also Read: Philippines Blocks Binance Over Unlicensed Operations, Citing Investor ProtectionWhy It Matters: The U.S. Department of Justice noted KuCoin purposely failed to comply with anti-money laundering laws to grow its platform. The indictment further detailed KuCoin's alleged attempts to conceal its activities from U.S. regulators, including not requiring customer identification and falsely claiming to have no U.S. customers, said a Benzinga article.A crypto trader, Doncrypto questioned, "What ever Kucoin did wrong? They even made it KYC mandatory to comply with regulations?”, adding “Why is SEC trying to protect us from making money?Notable NFT and crypto expert, Foster Hilt tweeted about KuCoin joining the list of exchanges facing scrutiny, alongside Binance, Coinbase and Kraken. Hilt emphasized the current lack of regulatory clarity in the U.S. cryptocurrency landscape.  Hilt’s tweet concluded with a reminder: “This is yet another reminder that regardless of how big or reputable an exchange appears to be, the best practice is to always self-custody your crypto.”The allegations against KuCoin, especially in the lead-up to the Bitcoin halving event, have broader implications for the crypto market and its operations as a whole.

ChatGPT crypto scam videos are flooding YouTube

Have you seen YouTube ads recently for a “slippage bot” that uses ChatGPT and promises to help you earn passive income with crypto? It’s a scam. And it’s ripping off a lot of people, all while using unsuspecting actors hired on Fiverr who don’t understand what they’ve been hired to read. One of the actors tells Gizmodo he ultimately didn’t even get paid for his work, despite his face showing up constantly on YouTube under accounts he doesn’t control.Is Bitcoin a good speculative investment?The videos all follow the same basic script. They open with an actor saying they personally created a bot using ChatGPT that allows anyone to earn money without any real coding knowledge. Early in the videos, the actors warn that the crypto community has lots of scammers, so it’s important that the viewer not interact with “unfamiliar wallets” and “unknown exchanges.”After getting the ironic warning about scammers out of the way, the script then dives into where you can copy code that can be pasted into a website that will supposedly execute a so-called front run on crypto transactions. You’ll have to link up your crypto wallet, of course, for the entire thing to work. The underlying idea, also known as a sandwich attack, is a real thing done by unethical crypto traders to extract money. But that’s not what will happen if you try to execute the code in the video.If you actually just breeze through the code, there’s nothing inherently suspicious about it, aside from the promise of free money. But that’s because the real wallet address has been hidden inside by splitting it up into pieces. Anyone who connects their Metamask wallet and runs the code simply sends their crypto to one of many wallets controlled by the anonymous scammers.The videos all follow the same basic script with minor changes and the only real difference between many of the videos is the wording about  how much you’ll supposedly make with their technique. Sometimes the titles and thumbnails promise $2,000 a day or $3,000 per day, while others list the amounts in ethereum or percentages. But anyone who follows the video’s instructions is going to make precisely zero dollars, and instead send their crypto to scammers.Gizmodo has yet to find evidence that anyone who’s appearing in these videos knows they’re participating in a scam. In fact, three of the people we’ve talked to were all hired on Fiverr for video and voice-acting work. And it’s pretty clear why these scammers are hiring real actors. By laying down a few hundred dollars at a gig-work site like Fiverr, (one actor told us he got $500), these scammers get real people to be the face of their scam without ever revealing their own identities while raking in the real money.As you can see in the short video compilation we’ve compiled below, the  script being read is identical across hundreds of videos on YouTube.Clips from scam YouTube videos featuring unsuspecting actorsThe videos have been an enormous headache for some of the actors involved because there appears to be an army of new YouTube accounts posting the videos every day. The actors have no control over how the videos are being used, and even if they’re able to get some taken down, they’re reappearing constantly on other accounts.“I’ve been contacted by internet security professionals, OSINT  enthusiasts, [...] one victim,  AND multiple people in my real life relationships that have had the  video hit their feeds,” one of the actors, Scott Panfil, told Gizmodo by email on Sunday.Panfil, a 41-year old music teacher in New York, went on to say that at least four “actual friends” have reached out to him since seeing the videos in their YouTube ads. He contacts YouTube every time he finds a new video to get it taken down but it’s quite a game of whack-a-mole.Panfil reached out to Fiverr to ask about the account that hired him and was told it was terminated. But he says Fiverr insisted it couldn’t do anything beyond that. A spokesperson for Fiverr told Gizmodo in an email Tuesday the company has blocked the accounts brought to their attention and are going to provide Panfil with some kind of compensation after he wasn’t paid.“Any attempt to defraud or scam others is in clear violation of our terms of service and strictly prohibited. It is against our Community Standards  to allow anyone to use services offered through Fiverr to promote  intentionally misleading information or fraud, or that can pose  financial risks for our users,” the Fiverr spokesperson said.Many of the scammy videos are  unlisted, meaning they don’t show up in regular YouTube and Google search results. But they frequently appear as paid ads, as you can see below in a screenshot Gizmodo took on March 23. That video on the far right featuring Panfil is “sponsored,” indicated just below the title that it’s being promoted through YouTube’s ad program.Anyone who clicks to view the supposed creator’s other videos will see just five or six created recently. Those videos tend to be generic explainers on technical topics like NFTs and smart contracts, making it appear as though the person who ostensibly created this YouTube page knows what they’re talking about when it comes to crypto. But the person that’s featured on each YouTube account has no control over the content that appears there, as you can see in an account using Panfil’s face below. These people were just hired for a single video on Fiverr and their videos are being reused repeatedly.Most of the tutorials acting as a smokescreen aren’t even narrated. They’re boring and act as nothing more than cover for the paid ads that aren’t even visible to a basic search on YouTube. Again, it should be stressed that the people who have appeared in these ads probably have no idea they’re promoting a scam. And their videos are being used across several accounts.The other common element in all of these YouTube videos is that the comments are overwhelmingly positive, clearly a result of some bot network trying to lend the scams credibility.Oddly enough, Gizmodo first learned about this scam about a month ago while combing through consumer complaints filed with the FTC that mention ChatGPT. We obtained the complaints through the Freedom of Information Act, and one complaint, which was filed on Dec. 27, 2023, really caught our eye:I found a video from YouTube “etsy web3 dev,” YouTuber video called “I used ChatGPT arbitrage Trading Bot to make $1,248 per day - passive income.”I followed instructions to deposit 0.5 Ethereum from my Metamask crypto wallet to an Etherscan contract that I was instructed to create. I did create the contract then used the compiler in ChatGPT to generate profit from my 0.5 ETH that I sent from my Metamask account. Nothing was found in my wallet and YouTuber could not respond my message. I tried again with 0.65 ETH the following day, but still nothing showed in my contract. I suspect the YouTuber to take in a way my Ethereum through the instructions are crooked to steal my money that are now worth $2,500 total.The name of the person who filed the complaint was redacted by the FTC, which is standard practice when the agency releases documents through FOIA, so we were unable to reach out to that person directly. But having the name of a scammy video led us down a rabbit hole where we found hundreds of other videos with similar titles, all promising easy passive income. They were all using the same script and being read by real people.Ever since we started looking into this scam, the YouTube videos have become even more common, as others on social media have reported seeing them frequently in recent days. YouTube spokesperson Javier Hernandez says the platform has “strict policies in place to protect the YouTube community” and six channels have been terminated for scams and other deceptive practices. “We are also in the process of reviewing the ads in question and will take the appropriate action on those that violate our ads policies,” Hernandez said via email. Most of the videos have real actors, but there are some where we never see a person appear aside from the thumbnail. And while almost all of the videos we found containing this scam featured male actors, there were some that featured female voice actors but they rarely had visual representation of an actual woman in the video, aside from some thumbnails.How much are these scammers making? That part is hard to figure out precisely, but Gizmodo messaged one victim who said he lost 1 ETH, which is about $3,300 at the current price. Based on anecdotal reports on various crypto forums the amount being pulled in by these scammers is almost certainly reaching into the hundreds of thousands and beyond.There are a handful of video explainers trying to warn people about the scam. But they haven’t gotten much attention. This video, for example, has just 75,000 views at the time of this writing despite being up for almost a year. Disturbingly, some of the videos claiming to debunk the scam are actually just trying to push their own version of the scam by debunking other videos and claiming they have a real bot that can generate this kind of passive income.Needless to say, you should be wary of anyone promising a way to make easy money. And if you’re an actor looking to do some work through Fiverr, make sure you understand what you’re reading. Because even if you get paid, you could be confronted with some major frustrations down the line if it winds up being a scam.A version of this article originally appeared on Gizmodo.

Coinbase Loses SEC Case Dismissal Bid: How Big Is the Blow? - DailyCoin


        
Judge Katherine Polk Falia has ruled on Coinbase’s motions to dismiss the SEC case against it.



The ruling was not what many in the crypto industry expected.



Experts have, however, downplayed the impact of the ruling.
After months of anticipation, Judge Katherine Polk Falia has finally entered her ruling on Coinbase‘s motions to dismiss the SEC case against it. The ruling, however, was not what many in the crypto space had hoped for.Following months of deliberation, Judge Falia sided with the SEC on all but one claim, setting the stage for the case to head to trial.How impactful is the ruling in this case that could help shape the future of the crypto industry in the U.S.?Coinbase Motion to Dismiss Largely DeniedIn a decision filed on Wednesday, March 27, Judge Falia denied Coinbase’s motion to dismiss the SEC case against it “in large part,” contending that the federal markets regulator had made a “plausible” case against the exchange for allegedly facilitating the trading of unregistered securities."As explained herein, the 'crypto' nomenclature may be of recent vintage, but the challenged transactions fall comfortably within the framework that courts have used to identify securities for nearly eighty years," she wrote.Judge Falia extended the same view to Coinbase’s staking service. The judge cited customers’ dependence on the exchange’s “managerial efforts” in arguments for why the service could fall under the Howey definition of an investment contract.Nonetheless, it was not a landslide win for the SEC, as Judge Falia sided with Coinbase on one claim. Contrary to the agency’s complaint, the judge found that the exchange had not operated as an unregistered broker through its wallet service.



Despite market jitters in response to the ruling, experts have downplayed its impact.Coinbase Dismissal Loss Par for the Course?Responding to the ruling, Coinbase Chief Legal Officer Paul Grewal suggested that the outcome was largely expected."Early motions like ours against a government agency are almost always denied. But clarity is the ultimate goal and today's decision continues us on that path," the attorney wrote in a six-part X post.According to Grewal, the exchange remains confident in its arguments and embraces the opportunity to prove them in court.



The Coinbase CLO was not the only one to dismiss the impact of the recent ruling on the case. Chiming in, Brown Rudnick Partner Stephen Palley described the ruling as “work-a-day procedural stuff.”Variant Fund Chief Legal Officer Jake Chervinsky described the ruling as “disappointing,” highlighting the optimism that had followed oral arguments in January 2024. Nonetheless, the lawyer surmised, “it’s only the beginning — not the end — of the SEC’s case against Coinbase.”Judge Falia set a deadline of April 19 for Coinbase and the SEC to come up with a case scheduling plan.On the Flipside
Many in the crypto industry have hailed the court ruling that Coinbase does not offer an unregistered brokerage service through its wallet as a win for DeFi.



With the case going to trial, a jury will decide Coinbase’s fate, not the judge.
Why This MattersThe recent ruling in the SEC case against Coinbase has caused significant concern in the crypto space, with some crypto asset prices sliding in response. Experts, however, suggest that this concern is not warranted.Read this for more on the SEC case against Coinbase:How the Coinbase vs SEC Showdown Could Alter “Securities”See how KuCoin’s recent legal woes affect you:How KuCoin’s DoJ Fight Affects User Funds and What to Do

Fifth Largest Bitcoin Whale Moves $6 Billion In BTC, Here’s The Destination


                            The crypto community’s attention has been drawn to a Bitcoin whale who recently moved a huge portion of their BTC holdings across different wallets. This action has sparked the curiosity of those in the community about the reason for these transactions. 
Bitcoin Whale Moves $6 Billion In BTC
Blockchain analysis platform Arkham Intelligence first brought this occurrence to the community’s attention when it mentioned in an X (formerly Twitter) post that the Bitcoin address (37XuVSE) had moved over $6 billion in BTC to three new addresses. 

As part of the transactions, $5.03 billion worth of BTC was sent to one of these addresses (bc1q8yj), while the two other addresses (bc1q6m5 and bc1q592) received $561.46 million and $488.40 million worth of BTC respectively. Arkham added that one of the wallets (bc1q592) has since then proceeded to transfer the received funds to another wallet. 
Notably, the wallet which moved $6 billion in BTC was before now the fifth richest Bitcoin address having held over 94,500 BTC in its wallet. As of now, it still holds 1.31 BTC in the wallet in question. Interestingly, before now, this address was dormant as it had not moved any of this BTC which it received since 2019. 
Transactions of such magnitude are always sure to cause a stir in the crypto community, considering the impact such whales can have on the market. Usually, a move like this can cause community members to speculate that the whale may be looking to offload their tokens and take profits. However, the fact that these transactions weren’t made to exchange-linked wallets has quelled such speculations. 
Another BTC Whale On The Rise
Bitcoinist recently reported on BlackRock’s Bitcoin wallet, which has continued to accumulate Bitcoin at an astonishing rate due to the impressive demand for its iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT). Despite just launching this ETF in mid-January 2024, BlackRock now holds 243,126 BTC for the fund. 

BlackRock’s BTC holdings has seen it rise to becoming one of the largest corporate BTC holders, only behind centralized exchanges Binance, Bitfinex, and Coinbase and fellow Bitcoin ETF issuer Grayscale. A sustained demand for the IBIT ETF could however see BlackRock surpass these entities at some point. 
That is also something that could reflect positively on Bitcoin’s price seeing as how instituitional demand for the flagship crypto has helped propel it to new highs. 
At the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading at around $70,500, up in the last 24 hours according to data from CoinMarketCap.

Massive Bitcoin ETF Growth Will ‘Continue for Years’, Says Bitwise CIO - Decrypt

The overwhelming demand for Bitcoin spot ETFs over the past two months is likely to continue for many years, predicts Bitwise CIO Matt Hougan.The executive highlighted “key takeaways” from his interactions with investors and capital allocators this month who are interested in buying into the ETFs—one managed by Bitwise itself.One takeaway, he recalled in a Twitter post, is that there is “massive dispersion in the pace of adoption of bitcoin ETFs.” While some financial advisors and national account platforms are plugging into the products as early as possible, others aren’t considering any portfolio allocation for their clients—or aren’t enabling them on their platforms until next year.“The truth is, most professional investors still cannot buy bitcoin ETFs,” Hougan wrote. “That will change through a series of 100+ individual due diligence processes over the next two years.”Since launching on January 11, the Bitcoin ETFs have absorbed net inflows of $11.7 billion, despite also factoring in over $14.3 billion of old BTC outflows from the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC). On Tuesday alone, they took in another $418 million, including $16.7 million for the Bitwise Bitcoin ETF.Brazil-based Hashdex announced today that it was finally bringing its Bitcoin spot ETF online.Such flows already represent a massive leg up over previous years when money within institutional Bitcoin funds paled in comparison to today. According to CryptoQuant, this metric has risen from less than $20 billion to over $94.6 billion in the past six months as excitement around the ETFs began to take hold.On-chain data shows that demand from “accumulation addresses”—Bitcoin addresses that only buy and never sell—has also skyrocketed.“We estimate monthly Bitcoin demand has increased from 40K Bitcoin at the start of 2024 to 213K Bitcoin currently,” CryptoQuant Head of Research Julio Moreno told Decrypt. “An important part of this demand growth has been driven by ETF buying, but lately also from other large investors.”Compared to previous years, Hougan also said that investors have dialed up their once ideal 1% Bitcoin portfolio share, now preferring 3% or higher. The executive believes ETFs are the cause, having “de-risked” Bitcoin in the eyes of many.“Before, people were worried bitcoin could go to zero. In that world, a 1% allocation is all you can stomach,” he said. “But if “going to zero” is off the table, 3% or 5% starts to make more sense.”According to Coinshares’ Head of Research James Butterfill, most institutional investors remain “very under invested” in Bitcoin, which comprises only a 0.2% average share of their portfolios.“What proportion Bitcoin ends up being is dependent on risk appetite,” Butterfill told Decrypt, “A 4% position would represent only 100 basis point of additional risk in a regularly rebalanced portfolio.”Edited by Ryan Ozawa.Stay on top of crypto news, get daily updates in your inbox.

HSBC rolls out tokenized gold for Hong Kong retail investors 1

Renowned financial institution HSBC has entered the blockchain technology industry by making tokenized gold available for retail investors in Hong Kong. This initiative makes HSBC the first bank to provide retail investors with a tokenized real-world asset (RWAs) on a blockchain platform.HSBC rolls out its gold token for retail investorsAccording to its announcement, the HSBC Gold token is now available on its HSBC Online Banking and the HSBC HK Mobile App. In addition, the gold token can be minted on the Orion digital asset platform owned by the bank. This move reflects a bigger shift towards tokenizing real-world assets (RWAs) in the financial and banking industry.Tokenization is simply representing real-world assets as digital assets on a blockchain. This process, which usually offers enhanced security, transparency, and accessibility to users is either on private ledgers or on public blockchains like Ethereum. The firm’s decision to enter the tokenized gold market shows a growing demand for blockchain-based solutions in the financial industry.The firm had previously made hints towards offering tokenized gold as part of its digital asset custody platform when it announced a collaboration with Switzerland-based safekeeping platform Metaco. The successful launch of its gold token shows the bank’s commitment to offering innovative financial products by leveraging distributed ledger technology.HSBC’s Hong Kong’s head of wealth and personal banking Maggie Ng expressed pride in the HSBC Gold Token. The executive highlighted its status as the first retail product in Hong Kong based on distributed ledger technology authorized by the Securities and Futures Commission (SFC). This approval also adds credibility to the blockchain-based offering of the bank, setting a precedent for similar products in the region.Advantages of tokenized gold for investorsHolding tokenized gold has several advantages for retail investors. Due to the conversation from physical gold to digital tokens, investors can hold a fraction of gold. Aside from that, HSBC also eliminates the need to store gold in physical form while aiding seamless transactions. Moreso, using the blockchain enhances trust while ensuring the immutability and traceability of the tokenized assets.This recent move by HSBC mirrors the trend in the broader financial industry, where financial institutions are looking into blockchain-bass solutions for tokenization among other things like custody and transactions. The integration of blockchain technology into traditional banking shows a shift towards the digital ecosystem and innovation in the financial sector.With blockchain technology gaining momentum across various industries, HSBC’s move underscores the potential of distributed ledger technology. Also, by tokenizing gold and making it available to investors, the firm is opening up new opportunities for investment and financial inclusion in Hong Kong’s market landscape.The launch of the tokenized gold by HABC on its Orion digital assets platform is a landmark milestone in the adoption of blockchain technology in the financial sector. Aside from providing investors with tokenized gold, it also showcases HSBC as a flag bearer in leveraging blockchain for financial products.

Here’s How High Solana (SOL) Could Surge, According to Coin Bureau’s Guy Turner - The Daily Hodl


								A widely followed crypto analyst says that smart contract platform Solana (SOL) looks bullish on multiple timeframes.
In a new video update, Guy Turner, the host of Coin Bureau, tells his 2.45 million YouTube subscribers that Solana’s weekly and monthly charts foreshadow a 35-45% breakout for the Ethereum (ETH) rival above the $300 price tag.










According to Turner, Solana is also breaking out against Bitcoin (BTC), and he says that since the flagship digital asset is itself on the cusp of a rally due to its upcoming halving event in April, Solana could go even higher.
12:30 “In SOL’s case, it appears to be breaking out against BTC on the weekly and the monthly, foreshadowing a 35 to 45% gain respectively. 
What this means is that if BTC’s price stays roughly where it is, SOL could rally between 35 and 45%, bringing it close to that $300 mark. Given that the Bitcoin halving is just around the corner, it’s likely that BTC’s price will rally though. That means a 35 to 45% gain in SOL versus BTC would bring it above the $300 milestone.”
Source: Coin Bureau/YouTube
Guy goes on to say that four of Solana’s upcoming milestones will also play a key role in whether or not it surges to $300.
“Whether SOL can hit $300 or more depends on Solana’s milestones. The Solana Foundation put out a de facto roadmap back in January which included four milestones. 
The first was the release of token extensions which you’ll recall occurred shortly after in January. The second milestone is the launch of new validator clients, namely Firedancer… the Firedancer client will significantly increase Solana’s speed but it’s not clear by how much… 
The third milestone on Solana’s de facto roadmap is unspecified institutional support. The milestone notes that enterprises now have access to all the tools they need to build on Solana. The fact that Solana’s purpose is to be a decentralized NASDAQ suggests that tokenized real world assets could be coming.” 
The fourth milestone, according to Turner, is the Solana Foundation’s call to developers to make use of all the tools at their disposal to build products and services over Solana.
SOL is trading for $181.55 at time of writing, a 5% decrease during the last 24 hours.

DeFi Protocol Ethena (USDE) Plans to Airdrop Governance Token Next on April 2

The protocol is set to airdrop 750 million ENA tokens, or 5% of the total supply. The campaign to earn "shards," which qualify users for the token airdrop, will end on April 1. Those who unstake, unlock or sell all their USDe before this date will not be eligible for the airdrop.

Not just the halving: Why analysts are bullish on Bitcoin in 2024

The Bitcoin (BTC) halving in April will only be one small part of why the cryptocurrency could see phenomenal gains this year, according to multiple industry analysts.Next month, the Bitcoin halving will reduce daily BTC production by about 450 BTC from the current average daily amount of 900 BTC, investment researcher Lyn Alden told Cointelegraph.However, Alden said the amount of supply cut pales compared to daily fiat flows in and out of crypto exchanges and Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs).“In fact, inflows or outflows can easily exceed 10x of that value,” Alden said, adding that overall demand for Bitcoin is a “bigger factor than tightening supply.”Historically, demand for Bitcoin has been more correlated with measures of global liquidity, such as the global broad money supply, Alden stressed, referring to a chart reflecting the BTC price versus global monetary supply (M2).Bitcoin price vs. global liquidity (M2). Source: Look into Bitcoin“So I think the halving is important, but it’s only one factor out of many that determines the occurrence and timing of a bull market. Various measures of global liquidity, HODL waves, and other catalysts combine to serve a larger role,” Alden said, adding:“I am bullish for the next two years due to a combination of the halving, expectations for improved global liquidity, and the fact that so many coins have rotated to strong hands in the bear market, and so a relatively minor increase in demand can move the price quite a bit.”10x Research CEO and head analyst Markus Thielen says the current rally is “undoubtedly on par” with the 2020 and 2021 bull market, which initially peaked in April 2021.Referring to tools like quantitative analysis, Thielen has been bullish on the price of Bitcoin after the cryptocurrency crossed its multi-year highs on March 13, 2024. Based on historical price changes and Bitcoin’s recent new highs, 10x Research projected that Bitcoin would reach $77,000 by early April and $99,000 by May 2024.“When Bitcoin made a new high at $68,300, we saw a wave of intraday selling, but every attempt to push down prices has been met with relentless buying,” Thielen wrote in an email to Cointelegraph on March 14.The analyst noted that each time Bitcoin made new price breakouts in February 2013, February 2017, and November 2020, the price could grow s much as 189% after 180 days. Eventually, Bitcoin would top after nine to 11 months following the breakouts historically, Thielen noted.Bitcoin 90 days after making new bull market highs. Source: 10x ResearchThielen forecasted that between December and February 2025 — or in nine to 11 months following the March 13 breakout — Bitcoin could move to an eye-watering $146,000.“Although corrections and retracements could occur at any time, traders could use the breakout level — $68,300 — as their new line in the sand, where we can argue that above this level, Bitcoin could be materially higher over the next few weeks and months,” the analyst said, adding:“Despite the possibility that Bitcoin could climb to 146,000 this summer, we keep our 125,000 price target for now as we expect this bull market to continue until 2025.”The current Bitcoin rally is the first time Bitcoin has posted a parabolic rise and hit a new all-time high before the block reward halving, eToro crypto analyst Simon Peters emphasized.According to Peters, the main reason for such a breakout is the launch of spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETF) in the United States on Jan. 11, 2024.“Demand for Bitcoin is fast outstripping the new supply, and this is something we’ve never really had in previous cycles,” Peters stressed. Before the introduction of ETFs, the demand was previously driven mainly by retail, while the ongoing cycle is going to be “more institutional,” he added.According to Peters, Bitcoin miners are the only natural sellers, as they have been actively dumping BTC since August 2023. “This suggests to me that miners have already been selling into the current rally in preparation for the upcoming block reward halving,” the analyst said, adding that all selling is “well bid” because of the high demand from spot ETFs," said Peters, adding: “If we do see a slowdown in spot ETF inflows, this could be an indication of the market topping out and running out of steam, but it’s important to note that whilst the ETFs have been a major contributor to the rally so far, they are not the only participants in the space. Other entities such as MicroStrategy and Bitcoin whales continue to accumulate too.”Meanwhile, Exness financial market strategist Li Xing sees macroeconomic developments driving the Bitcoin price this year. Apart from the spot Bitcoin ETF launch, other economic developments, like expectations of a softer monetary policy and lower interest rates in the U.S. and elsewhere, could boost Bitcoin’s appeal as an alternative store of value, the analyst said.Related: Bitcoin to enter pre-halving ’danger zone,’ but crypto CEOs remain bullish“Moreover, geopolitical risks and uncertainties surrounding the U.S. elections could continue to buoy demand, marking the beginning of a sustained bull run in the future,” Li added.Programmed to occur once per 210,000 blocks or roughly every four years, Bitcoin halvings are designed to maintain Bitcoin’s deficit and counteract inflation.Since its launch in 2009, Bitcoin has come through three halving events in 2012, 2016 and 2020, cutting its miner incentive from the initial 50 BTC to the current 6.5 BTC. The soon-to-come Bitcoin halving in 2024 will further decrease the mining reward from 6.5 BTC to 3.125 BTC.Historically, Bitcoin halvings have been associated with post-halving rallies. For example, Bitcoin skyrocketed about 3,000% in 17 months after halving in 2016, reaching a historic milestone of $20,000 in December 2017.Magazine: ‘Crypto is inevitable’ so we went ‘all in’: Meet Vance Spencer, permabull

1.3 Billion Dollar Cryptocurrency Project Announces Airdrop Distribution: Here is the Critical Date - Bitcoin Sistemi


Ethena, the decentralized finance (DeFi) protocol known for its $1.3 billion USDe token, announced today that it plans to launch its governance token. According to a recent blog post, the token will be introduced to users through an airdrop scheduled for April 2.
The protocol plans to distribute a total of 750 million ENA tokens, representing 5% of the total supply. The “shard” winning campaign, which qualifies users for the token airdrop, will end on April 1. Users who bought back, unlocked or sold all their USDe before this date will not be considered for the airdrop.


Starting the day after the airdrop, users will be able to claim their tokens. ENA will also be listed on centralized exchanges, according to the blog post. Following the airdrop, Ethena will launch a new campaign with additional incentives for the next phase of the airdrop.

Ethena's USDe token, often referred to as a “synthetic dollar”, claims to provide stable returns to investors. This is achieved by using Ethereum (ETH) liquid staking tokens, such as Lido's stETH, as the supporting asset. These are paired with short ETH perpetual futures positions of equal value on derivative exchanges to maintain a “rough target” price of $1. Known as “cash and carry” trading, this strategy uses derivative funding rates to generate returns.





The USDe token has seen significant growth recently, rising from $85 million at the beginning of the year to $1.3 billion.

Blob base fee surges, Ethereum misses slots as ‘BlobScriptions’ go viral - Blockworks


On Wednesday morning, the website Ethscriptions created a way to mint inscriptions on EIP-4844 blobs, which are cost-saving packets of data introduced in Ethereum’s recent Dencun upgrade.
As with other blockchains that have received the inscription treatment, so-called BlobScriptions have heavily driven up the price of blockspace — or in this case, blobspace. 
Since Dencun, the base fee for a blob, or the minimum gas price needed for a blob to be included in the next Ethereum block, has been one wei, an Ethereum-denominated price that is equivalent to a fraction of $0.01. 
Read more: The biggest Ethereum upgrade ever goes live
Today, the blob base fee climbed above 500 gwei, according to ultrasound.money. One gwei is worth a billion wei.
At the time of writing, the blob fee was roughly 6 gwei, marking a 60 trillion percent increase over the one wei blobs cost in the two weeks since Dencun. Six gwei is equal to around $0.20, according to CoinBrain. 
Notably, the much-increased blob fee is still lower than the price of gas on Ethereum’s layer-1, which stands at around 37 gwei, per Etherscan.
Nevertheless, at a price of one wei, blob space was effectively “free,” Blocknative CEO Matt Cutler told Blockworks in a text. “But the current Blob Base Fee is measured in Gwei and that’s far from free.”
Inscriptions — which have seen a resurgence in popularity on Bitcoin in recent months — create an inexpensive means of embedding art or would-be tokens onto a blockchain. In the case of BlobScriptions, a host of pictures and tokens are now being inscribed on blobs.
What’s important to note, however, is that blob data is only kept by Ethereum nodes for roughly 18 days to let layer-2s verify transactions. So after 18 days, BlobScriptions will disappear from Ethereum. But BlobScriptions will still be stored in the indexer for creator protocol Ethscriptions, co-founder Tom Lehman said on X.
Read more: What does EIP 4844 mean for Ethereum rollups?
In the four hours before press time, 41% of created blobs were inscription mints, according to a Dune dashboard. By way of comparison, popular layer-2s Arbitrum, Base, and Optimism each accounted for roughly 9% of blobs in the same time span. 
Lehman told Blockworks his goal in using blobs for inscriptions was to let people get around using expensive smart contracts for data storage. 
“We created Blobscriptions to enable ordinary people — not just giant layer-2s — to benefit from EIP-4844 blobs,” Lehman said in a direct message.
Ethereum also saw an increase in missed slots Wednesday afternoon, though there was disagreement among researchers as to whether the slots were being missed due to blob inscriptions or something else.
Either way, blob inscriptions could impede the low-fee promised land layer-2s have lived in for the past two weeks.
“[Is] this an ephemeral fad or a behavior that is here to stay? Time will tell,” Cutler wrote.

Age-old Cardano debate resurfaces: Which side are you on? - AMBCrypto



A crypto influencer questioned Cardano’s high market value despite lower network utilization.
Cardano’s market cap to TVL ratio was one of the highest in the space.

A crypto influencer enraged the supporters of popular smart contracts chain Cardano [ADA], sparking a heated debate on the network’s fundamentals.
What happened?
In a controversial X (formerly Twitter) post that went viral, MartyParty questioned the rationale behind the ADA token commanding a $23 billion-plus market valuation despite having much less network utilization.
The influencer went one step further by advising his followers to dump the token and shift to a “performing” blockchain token.
These remarks weren’t taken well by the Cardano community, who jumped to counter Marty’s arguments.
Some of them even called the transaction per second (TPS) data highlighted by him as outdated, adding a community note under his post with a link to the updated source.
Not the first time
Over the years, many prominent market observers have trained their guns on Cardano’s network capabilities and the justification behind it having a disproportionately larger market cap.
Just last month, Bitcoin [BTC] advocate and BitMeX co-founder Arthur Hayes threw shades at the network.
The Cardano community has energetically countered these arguments every time, with some questioning the use of TPS metric to gauge the network’s performance.
Others have drawn attention to the technical intricacies of a single transaction on Cardano.
Does the argument hold merit?
AMBCrypto assessed Cardano network through Santiment’s asset valuation metric, NVT Ratio. When compared to Ethereum [ETH], Cardano’s NVT Ratio has been on the lower side in recent months.
This meant that its market valuation was lower than the value being transmitted on the network, in other words an undervalued asset.
Source: Santiment
That being said, Cardano’s DeFi growth has lagged well behind its market cap increase.
As of this writing, its total value locked (TVL)  was just $418 million according to DeFiLlama, significantly lower than chains with similar market caps.

Read Cardano’s [ADA] Price Prediction 2024-25

These findings have led critics to question the network’s potential in building effective decentralized apps (dApps).
Meanwhile, ADA fell 4.5% in the last 24 hours, trading at $0.65 as of this writing, according to CoinMarketCap.

XRP Price Enters Pre-Bull Rally Phase: Crypto Analyst Reveals Next Target


                            The XRP price has largely left many of its enthusiasts feeling dissatisfied during this bull cycle, as it has failed to reach the $1 mark despite the bullish sentiment surrounding cryptocurrencies. However, crypto analyst EGRAG CRYPTO believes a $1 XRP price is still possible in this cycle, as he predicted a price surge in the near term. From this analyst’s technical perspective, recent price action has seen XRP forming a “W” pattern, making it ready for a massive push above $1.
XRP Price Pattern Signals A Potential Massive Move
XRP’s highest price so far this year is $0.718. The cryptocurrency now finds itself perambulating below the $0.65 price level and even falling to as low as $0.57 in the past seven days. This has prompted many investors and holders to feel frustrated and concerned about the poor price performance. 

Despite this lackluster performance, many analysts continue to hold on to a bullish price action for XRP. EGRAG, who is well-known for his bullish attitude on XRP, has, for the most part, encouraged his followers on social media to maintain their positive posture on XRP. His most recent technical analysis, which he shared on social media, indicates that the price formation of XRP has now established a bullish pattern, which has been responsible for significant price increases in the past.
This price spike is particularly based on a peculiar “W” pattern, which he highlighted on a 3-day candlestick chart of the XRP price. Interestingly, a detailed look into the chart shared by EGRAG shows that XRP embarked on the formation of this “W” pattern in July 2023. Now that the formation seems complete, the analyst noted that XRP could potentially surge to $1 on a standard scale and $1.2 on a logarithmic scale.

At the time of writing, XRP is trading at $0.63. A surge to $1 and $1.2 from the current price level would mean a 58.7% and 90.47% spike respectively. However, EGRAG also noted the possibility of the “W” pattern leading to a downturn. In his price chart, he highlighted a worse case scenario of XRP falling to $0.44518. 
What’s Next For XRP?
EGRAG is one of the many crypto analysts who are still ultra-bullish on XRP’s price trajectory. His long-term price projection for XRP is $27. Other analysts like Mikybull predict XRP can reach as high as $6.

Ripple’s lawsuit with the SEC seems to be nearing its end which could mean the end of a prolonged stunted price growth for XRP. As a result, we could see XRP surging to new highs very soon. Whether or not XRP reaches $27 or sets new records, many see it as an undervalued asset with significant upside potential. This fundamental growth could see XRP push to $1 for the first time since November 2021.

Terra Luna Classic's $1 Dream: Is Chain Upgrade the Catalyst? - DailyCoin


        
Smoothly executed Hard Fork on Terra Luna Classic chain restores optimism.



Terra members greet the devs as LUNC reaches for a $1 billion market cap.



Terra Classic holder count mounted to a new all-time high at 5.52 million.
The Terra Luna Classic community is celebrating a breakthrough in further developing the game-tested blockchain. According to the pre-accepted governance proposal #12090, Terra Classic’s Layer-1 chain at block height 17309000 was supposed to kick in on March 25, disconnecting the chain briefly.This chain upgrade v2.4.2 brings highly-awaited improvements to the Layer-1 chain, including IBC-Hooks, which are crucial for the seamless integration of new decentralized applications (dApps) on the network, such as Enterprise DAO. As the Hard Fork procedure went smoothly, this has sparked the Terra Classic community’s optimism regarding LUNC.After completing the crucial Hard Fork, Genuine Labs, the developer team responsible for a smooth transition into the upgraded chain version, published a bi-weekly report confirming that the chain upgrade is implemented. As Terra Classic validators gradually returned online, community members greeted Genuine Labs for their great work.Terra Luna Classic’s $1 Dream Comes Closer?The smooth operation of v.2.4.2 post-upgrade has planted optimism among Terra Classic’s community members. Crypto chart analyst Crypto Anu insisted that this new chain upgrade adds extra security measures to Terra Classic’s chain via The Terra Classic Security Package, which is due for completion in eight weeks.Moreover, the recent upgrades have bumped the total LUNC holder count to 5.52 million, signaling long-term investor interest in this digital asset. Encouraged to contribute to LUNC burns, the community has set aflame to 105 billion LUNC tokens, leaving 5.8T Terra Classic tokens in circulation.Terra Luna Classic ranks just #124, struggling to keep itself relevant among newly-emerged competing altcoins and memecoins. However, the 35% surge over the past month has brought optimism to its community as it continues to task itself with Terra Luna’s chain revitalization plan. Spearheaded to $1, LUNC would still be far from its all-time high set at $119 on April 5, 2022.On the Flipside
The recent LUNC price surge is partly attributable to the recent legal developments of Do Kwon’s release.



Terra Luna chain’s creator has been released from jail in Montenegro with a pending extradition status.



Meanwhile, the Securities and Exchange Commission initiated the TerraForm Labs trial for market manipulation.
Why This MattersOnce a TOP 5 blockchain by global market capitalization, Terra Luna Classic still hosts a vibrant community of developers and crypto enthusiasts aiming to restore a part of its former glory.

Top 4 Altcoins Poised for New All-Time Highs This April


March was an exceptional month for the crypto market as investors witnessed Bitcoin prices hitting all-time highs as well as the rise of multiple major altcoins. However, despite the bullishness, some altcoins missed the mark.
These altcoins will likely print new all-time highs in the coming month of April, when the second quarter of 2024 begins.
SUI Will Be the First to Shatter the Record
Sui is the altcoin in the top 100 cryptocurrencies list that is the closest to printing a new all-time high. The altcoin made an attempt last month but failed only to witness a 21% rise in the past 48 hours. This rally has brought it closer to the previous high of $2.10, witnessed back in May 2023.
SUI/USDT 1-day chart. Source: TradingView
The Relative Strength Index (RSI), a momentum oscillator measuring the speed and change of price movements, is also in the bullish zone. This suggests that the digital asset is not yet overbought and could cross $2.10 by the beginning of April.

Aptos (APT) Bull Run Continues
Aptos price rose from the low of $9 to nearly double in value as the altcoin can be seen changing hands at $18.6 at the moment. This rally will only continue as we move into Q2, given APT is less than 12.5% away from breaching the previous all-time high of $20.40 from January 2023.
APT/USDT 1-day chart. Source: TradingView
The Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD), a trend-following momentum indicator that is used to identify bullish and bearish trends, is also signaling growth. The indicator is continuing the bullish crossover uptrend, which will drive APT higher.

BNB Price Set to Initiate a Recovery
BNB is currently on a short-term incline, inching closer to the $691 ATH. The Binance native token is about 18.14% away from the price point, which would require BNB to close above the $600 mark first.

BNB/USDT 1-day chart. Source: TradingView
Although MACD and RSI are both noting a downtick right now, they aren’t highlighting bearish trends. As long as BNB stays above the 50-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA), the coin will have a shot at recovery, which will likely take place in April.
Arbitrum (ARB) Will Need a Push
Unlike other altcoins in this list, Arbitrum’s price noted its all-time high earlier this year back in January 2024. The cryptocurrency, however, noted significant correction since then, bringing the price down to $1.69.

ARB/USDT 1-day chart. Source: TradingView
The all-time high is now 42% away from the token, and ARB would need to flip the 50 and 100-day EMA in order to make it to $2. This support level will provide the boost necessary to rally on towards $2.40.

MACD indicates that a bullish crossover is imminent, suggesting that the uptrend momentum will reignite soon.

BOOK OF MEME Advances Rapidly In Trading Volume - BOME Bulls Look To Outperform Shiba Inu ⋆ ZyCrypto

&nbsp

&nbsp
In the crypto world, new projects frequently emerge and battle for attention and market share. One newcomer making waves in the market is Book Of Meme (BOME), a cryptocurrency that has recently captured the spotlight with its impressive increase in trading volume and price. BOME has even gotten close to the trading volume of Shiba Inu. With BOME’s rapid pump, everyone is eager to know what lies ahead for this memecoin.



BOME’s Recent Rise



In the last 24 hours, BOME experienced a remarkable pump in its price and trading volume, showing increased interest from traders and investors. BOME increased by 6.4% in price and 13.4% in trading volume, totalling an impressive $1.5 billion. This surge in trading activity has put BOME ahead of Shiba Inu, a cryptocurrency often dubbed the “Dogecoin Killer,” which recorded a trading volume of $1.2 billion over the same period.



This buzz surrounding BOME is happening due to several factors, such as listings on major crypto exchanges.



In addition to the listings, BOME’s derivatives data shows further optimism among investors. A notable 30% rise in volume and open interest reaching $143.4 million suggest strong demand for the memecoin. Specifically, over the last 24 hours, traders have been even more active as the number of liquidations has risen, mostly coming from long positions.



What’s Next for BOME?



Prominent crypto technical analyst Kyledoops has also weighed in on BOME’s potential, suggesting that the coin’s breakout from resistance levels has settled at a good support level. This move and its strength in testing these levels hint at a possible sustained pump. The analyst’s sentiments reflect the optimism around BOME as it continues to climb through the crypto rankings.

&nbsp



As BOME continues to challenge established players in the crypto space, there are still questions about its long-term stability. Will BOME emerge as a powerful contender, maintaining its momentum and gaining substantial market share, or will it become a victim of volatility and fall off like most meme coins?

What to expect at Sam Bankman-Fried’s sentencing hearing

On March 28, former FTX CEO Sam “SBF” Bankman-Fried will face a judge and learn whether his time in federal prison is ending or just beginning following his conviction on seven felony charges.Judge Lewis Kaplan will hear from prosecutors and SBF’s attorneys in United States District Court for the Southern District of New York for one of the last times the former FTX CEO will appear in person as part of his criminal case. The sentencing hearing will likely conclude the matter, which started with the collapse of FTX in November 2022 and continued with Bankman-Fried’s arrest, extradition, trial and conviction.Source: Will RobbinsIn November 2023, a jury found SBF guilty of charges that included wire fraud, securities fraud, commodities fraud and money laundering. The former CEO’s lawyers were the first to file a sentencing recommendation, suggesting that SBF serve 6.5 years in prison for his actions that led to FTX investors losing access to millions of dollars. The seven felony counts carry a maximum allowable sentence of 110 years. Prosecutors recommended Bankman-Fried serve between 40 and 50 years to “reflect the seriousness of the defendant’s crimes,” but the decision will come down to Judge Kaplan’s interpretation of the case and consideration of the victims and affected parties.“I think you’re going to see a sentence of, I’m going to handicap about 30 years, is what I think [SBF] will get — maybe more,” Mark Bini, a former Assistant U.S. Attorney in the Eastern District of New York and current partner at law firm Reed Smith, told Cointelegraph. “There’s a big dispute between the government and the defense about the loss number here — what is the actual amount that was lost, because that’s a big driver of the guidelines.”Bini said the sentencing guidelines would require Judge Kaplan to consider the amount lost at the time of the collapse of FTX rather than any repayment plan the firm has proposed in bankruptcy proceedings. One proposed plan would reimburse FTX users in fiat for their lost crypto based on prices in November 2022 — many have pointed out that this would cause them to miss out on recent surges in the price of Bitcoin (BTC) and other tokens.“My whole life has been destroyed,” said one unidentified FTX user with two children in a victim impact statement to the court. “I did not agree to the risk that SBF took with my funds.”Source: Tiffany FongRelated: Crypto users weigh in on Sam Bankman-Fried’s prison time ahead of sentencing memoBankman-Fried’s case is mainly new ground regarding a high-profile figure from the digital asset space going through a full trial and being convicted and sentenced. Ross Ulbricht, creator of the Silk Road marketplace, was sentenced to two life sentences without the possibility of parole in 2015. Elizabeth Holmes, founder of Theranos, was sentenced to more than 11 years for exaggerating or falsifying claims about the firm’s blood-testing technology.In the crypto world, former Binance CEO Changpeng “CZ” Zhao has pleaded guilty to one felony count related to failure to maintain an effective Anti-Money Laundering program at the crypto exchange and is scheduled to be sentenced in April. Former Celsius CEO Alex Mashinsky, charged with defrauding and misleading customers, is set to go to trial in September.“I don’t think that we’ll see [CZ’s] case impacted that much because they’re very different types,” said Bini. “The Mashinsky case, it could have big consequences because you’ve got the same defense attorney who’s now representing SBF and both of those being in the Southern District of New York. They’re not exactly the same, but [...] certainly Mashinsky will be watching.”Bankman-Fried’s sentencing is scheduled to begin at 9:30 am ET in New York on March 28, his first appearance in court since waiving a potential conflict of interest for his lawyers. It’s unclear if SBF’s family will be in attendance.Magazine: ‘Less flashy’ Mashinsky set for less jail time than SBF: Inner City Press, X Hall of Flame

Kucoin, In Trouble With Lawsuits In The US, Announces That It Will Distribute 10 Million Dollar Airdrop To Its Users - Bitcoin Sistemi

Cryptocurrency prices experienced a significant decline yesterday following the accusations made against the KuCoin cryptocurrency exchange by the US Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) and the US Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York.
The charges, which included violations of the Bank Secrecy Act and unlicensed money transfer crimes, led to a significant outflow of assets from the exchange.


According to the statement made by the CFTC, a civil lawsuit was filed in New York Court against Mek Global Limited, PhoenixFin PTE Ltd, Flashdot Limited and Peken Global Limited. These entities collectively operate KuCoin, a centralized digital asset exchange, and have been charged with multiple violations of the Commodity Exchange Act (CEA) and CFTC regulations.
Following these accusations, onchain analysis and intelligence company Nansen reported that a total of $1.7 billion in crypto assets were withdrawn from this exchange. In the last 24 hours, there has been an outflow of over $842 million in Ethereum and $938 million in EVM chains from an initial asset level of $6 billion, representing a more than 15% decline in assets held by the exchange.






In response to these developments, KuCoin announced a $10 million airdrop to its users. KuCoin CEO Johnny Lyu thanked all KuCoin users for their support and trust over the past seven years. Lyu acknowledged that some users experienced longer-than-expected wait times when making withdrawals on March 26 and 27, and apologized for this.
According to its official statement, KuCoin will launch a special airdrop event worth a total of $10 million in KCS and BTC to express their deep gratitude for user support and patience. “We hope that through this initiative we can express our gratitude for the support of our loyal users,” Lyu said.


According to the official announcement, the rules of the airdrop event will be officially announced within three days.

Solana-based WEN erases losses: Time for another hike? - AMBCrypto



Sentiment around WEN was positive as trading volume increased.
The 4-hour analysis suggested a possible climb toward $0.00088.

WEN, the cat-themed meme coin built on Solana [SOL], has seen its price increase by an incredible 29.10% in the last 24 hours. Like the price, the trading volume of WEN also jumped.
At press time, the volume was $345.71 million, hinting at increased interest in the token. Before, its recent decrease to $0.00049, the price of WEN climbed to $0.00051.
This value represented the highest point it had reached within the last month.
The cat has a bull’s eye
AMBCrypto’s investigation into the reasons for the unprecedented hike provided some insights. According to our findings, Crypto.com’s listing of WEN was one reason for the hike.
Not many centralized exchanges have the coin listed.
So, when the exchange announced the listing on the 26th of March, demand for the token soared. WEN is one of the meme coin that has launched on Solana in the last six months.
Although, it does not have the Bonk [BONK] and dogwifhat [WIF] kind of hype yet, on-chain data showed many market participants have kept an eye on it.
According to Santiment, WEN’s social volume jumped to 156 on the 26th of March. The hike was proof that attention in the market shifted to the Solana-based token.
When AMBCrypto checked the Weighted Sentiment, we noticed that the metric soared. At press time, the Weighted Sentiment had skyrocketed to 1.25, indicating a bullish perception around the token.
Source: Santiment
If sentiment remains bullish in the coming days, the price of WEN might increase further. However, traders might need to be wary of profit-taking.
In a case where selling pressure increases, the possible rise beyond $0.00051 might be disproved.
WEN targets the moon
However, it is also important to look at the price potential from a technical angle. As of this writing, the Relative Strength Index (RSI) on the 4-hour WEN/USD pair showed the token was overbought.
In this state, it is expected that WEN’s price might retrace. If the price declines, the value of the token might pull back as low as $0.00037 (the 0.786 Fibonacci retracement level).
Despite the possible decline, our analysis showed that the price of WEN might extend to $0.00088 (the 4.238 Fib level). However, the possible jump to $0.00088 might not happen immediately.
In addition, indications from the Awesome Oscillator (AO) showed that WEN could continue its upward movement. At press time, the AO reading was positive, indicating increasing bullish momentum.

In the short term, WEN’s value might decrease below $0.00049. However, a possible memecoin season might be close.
When this begins, the cryptocurrency might be one of the tokens that could display an exceptional performance. For the time being, traders might be on the lookout for good entries.

Blast dapp hack was an inside job, and it could have been worse - Blockworks


Munchables, a GameFi project built on Blast, reported late Tuesday that it was “compromised” to the tune of $62 million.
A further $25 million was spared in a related vault of Juice Finance due to an apparent typo.
By blacklisting the hacker’s address, the network was able to seal off the funds, and convince the attacker to give up the controlling private keys.
And that’s not all that’s unusual.
On-chain evidence provided by investigator ZachXBT indicates that the culprit went by a variety of pseudonyms.
“Four different devs hired by the Munchables team and linked to the exploiter are likely all the same person,” he wrote on X following the incident.
Read more: $80M lost in first hack of 2024
Users of Juice Finance, which designed a vault and bot system to play the game and earn valuable points at an accelerated rate, were also at risk, according to Chief Operating Officer Eric Ryklin. 
The Juice team independently reviewed Munchables’ code, a prerequisite for launching its own product.
“The malicious exploit was not in their code,” Ryklin told Blockworks. “Nor is it in their actual audit itself.”
“This guy pushed an upgrade that no one could have seen — it was unverified — and it essentially gave him three wallets that had unlimited access to withdraw funds, plus he had the keys to the upgrader and the main deployer wallet,” he said.
Read more: Latest DeFi exploits show audits are no guarantee
Juice and Munchables shared several investors, and both teams were in touch with each other regularly in the runup to the theft, Ryklin said. The malicious actor, who worked for Munchables, was a member of a group chat that included the Juice team.
“They met this guy in a developer Discord somewhere across the space,” Ryklin recalled, and after the hack it emerged that the team was not the actual owner of their contracts.
“Someone from their HR team messed up big time,” blockchain security firm SlowMist said on X.
Ryklin described it as a “sleeper cell,” and ZachXBT pointed to North Korean hackers as likely responsible.
“This guy inserted three sleeper wallets into the actual contract that no one could find at first,” Ryklin said. “But the second that he would do a transaction, that sleeper wallet would become public, so the Blast sequencer could essentially blacklist him.”
ZachXBT declined to comment on how he arrived at that conclusion. 
A spokesperson for security firm CertiK told Blockworks “it’s highly unusual that the funds were then returned to the project from a malicious DPRK affiliated worker” — referring to agents of the North Korean government — and that the firm assessed it could be “a rogue developer,” who, with their identity revealed, “decided to give the funds back after pressure from the Web3 community to prevent further backlash.”
“Obviously, seeing the funds returned is abnormal behavior,” ZachXBT told Blockworks.
In any case, quickly recognizing those wallets proved crucial to securing the return of the stolen funds.

With the jig up, and no way to exfiltrate the funds, the attacker made it easier on the Blast team by handing over their private keys.
That avoided the need to employ more technical solutions.
“Blast could have definitely pushed a soft fork to literally just blacklist his wallet and pull the money out,” Ryklin said, “I think at that point, it’s like, ‘Why would he not give the keys back?’”
The hacker was not able to take 7349.99 wrapped ether, worth about $25 million at the time, as a result of an apparent typo. It was what Juice’s auditor, Trust Security, called “one of the weirdest side stories of the Munchables exploit.”
Instead of snatching all the wrapped ether, the attacker took just 73.49 wETH (about $267,000).
“The hacker was off by two 0s when inputting the amount! It is easy to confirm in a simulation that they could have indeed taken the whole vault,” Trust said. “It must have taken the hacker over eight minutes to realize their mistake, which is when the team paused withdrawals.”
CertiK confirmed to Blockworks this was the most plausible explanation for the data.
None of Juice’s other vaults or its own smart contracts were affected, the team said.
The hacker also missed the chance to grab an additional $7 million in USDB, Blast’s interest bearing stablecoin, which was secured before it could be stolen, Ryklin said.
“The bridges got closed, so the money was contained,” he said.
That meant that, unlike in other hacking cases, the thief had no leverage. The fact that Blast has multiple centralized components meant that there would be no chance to try to launder the proceeds.

That may trouble some “decentralization maxis,” but Ryklin finds it completely normal at this stage of the network’s development.
“I think the reason that you were able to successfully recover $97 million instead of everyone losing their money is because there are guardrails in place, and I don’t think those are the worst things in the world,” he said.

Can Solana’s Decaf App Bring the Unbanked to Crypto? - DailyCoin


        
Decaf uses Solana to make financial services accessible in over 184 currencies. 



Stablecoin transfers offer a safeguard against inflation.



Decaf simplifies the transition from fiat to crypto. 
The global financial landscape is marked by pronounced disparities, with access to stable and reliable financial services remaining out of reach for significant portions of the world’s population. In regions plagued by economic instability, residents often face the dual challenges of inflation and limited access to traditional banking systems.In light of these challenges, blockchain technology has been heralded for its potential to offer alternative solutions. Among the initiatives emerging in this space is Decaf, a digital wallet built on the Solana blockchain, which aims to mitigate some of these financial disparities. How Decaf Uses Solana to Onboard Unbanked to CryptoOn Tuesday, March 26, the Solana Foundation featured Decaf, a mobile payment app, in its “Only Possible on Solana” series. Co-founded by Fernanda Orduña Rangel, Decaf targets the issues people face in unstable and underdeveloped economies.Decaf lets users easily convert their assets between 184 fiat currencies and various cryptocurrencies. The platform has also integrated with Moneygram locations globally, enabling users to redeem crypto for fiat at over 350,000 locations worldwide. Critically, due to its support for stablecoins like USDC, the platform offers a stable alternative in countries experiencing significant inflation. This means it enables people in affected countries to preserve their savings in an economic crisis. Can Solana Apps Onboard the Unbanked to Crypto? The potential for technological solutions to the problems of the unbanked is there, and Solana, with its high-performance blockchain, presents a fertile ground for applications that aim to address this. However, crucial factors need to be considered. 



In many regions, particularly in Africa and Asia, mobile payment apps like M-Pesa, Paytm, and GCash have significantly impacted financial inclusion. These platforms have successfully onboarded millions of users by providing essential financial services. Blockchain-based apps like Decaf will have to compete with these apps. To do so, they require ease of use and a strong infrastructure. What is more, regulatory environments in these countries need to be conducive to blockchain solutions. On the Flipside
In some emerging markets, there is still considerable ambiguity or even hostility towards crypto, which could hinder operations and user adoption of crypto apps.



Blockchain technology cannot single-handedly rectify the complex economic and political issues contributing to financial instability and inequality. 
Why This MattersThe deployment of Decaf on Solana represents an important validation of blockchain’s potential in real-world use cases. It also reinforces Solana’s position as a leading platform for developing scalable and accessible financial applications.

Larry Fink, who was once an enemy of Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies and is now one of the biggest pro-cryptocurrency names with his applications for Bitcoin and Ethereum Spot ETF, is making statements on Fox Business live broadcast.
We will constantly update and share Larry Fink's statements regarding the cryptocurrency market and the US economy here.



Larry Fink announced that he is bullish on Bitcoin in the long term.
Larry Fink: “Look, I'm very bullish on the long-term viability of Bitcoin. We're now producing a market with more liquidity and more transparency, and I'm very surprised by that, and I would never have predicted that before.”
Spot Bitcoin ETFs are the fastest growing ETFs in ETF history.
FOX reporter Charles Gasparino asked Fink a question about Ethereum: “There is a lot of buzz about the SEC declaring a security that would remove Ethereum from the category of its Bitcoin counterpart as a commodity. How would this be reflected in an ETF?” Fink answered the question this way: “I don't think so, look, and I can't really talk about it, but I don't think that characterization would be that harmful.” Gasparino: “So you can launch an ETH ETF even if it is a security?” Fink: “I guess so, yeah.”

BlackRock submitted its Ethereum ETF application in November and was included in the latest postponements by the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). The financial regulator's biggest concern may be the staking feature of the network.

U.S. Treasury Department Targets 13 Russian Firms Allegedly Offering Crypto-Related Services To Avoid Sanctions - The Daily Hodl


								The US Government has named entities and individuals allegedly responsible for providing crypto products and services that aided in the evasion of sanctions on Russia.
The U.S. Department of the Treasury’s Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) says that it has “sanctioned thirteen entities and two individuals for operating in the financial services and technology sectors of the Russian Federation economy.”










According to the agency, many of the designated individuals and entities “facilitated transactions or offered other services that helped OFAC-designated entities evade sanctions.”
Among the designated entities include the Moscow-based fintech firm B-Crypto, which OFAC accuses of partnering with Rosbank to enable Russian exporters to make cross-border payments using crypto assets. Rosbank is a Russian commercial bank that is also under US sanctions.
Other designated entities are Moscow-based fintech firms Masterchain, Laitkhaus, and Atomaiz. Peer-to-peer crypto exchange Bitpapa and centralized digit asset exchange Crypto Explorer were also sanctioned.
Firms based outside Russia that were sanctioned include Eastern European companies such as the Cyprus-based Tokentrust Holdings and the Estonia-based Bitfingroup.
Blockchain technology firms Veb3 Integrator and Veb3 Tekhnologii as well as fintech firm TOEP which operates a crypto exchange were also placed on the list of entities supporting the evasion of sanctions by Russian firms and individuals. The two firms are based in Moscow.
The two sanctioned individuals are Igor Veniaminovich Kaigorodov, the majority shareholder of Veb3 Integrator and Veb3 Tekhnologii and Timur Evgenyevich Bukanov, the owner and director of TOEP.
While some of America’s economic and trade sanctions on Russia have existed for decades, some of the most severe ones were placed following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine in February of 2022.
Last year in May, it was reported that the world’s largest crypto exchange Binance was being investigated by US authorities over possible violation of sanctions on Russia.

Invest In Altcoins Now Or Wait? What Experts Say Might Surprise You - Emeren Group (NYSE:SOL) - Benzinga

Altcoin Sherpa, a popular analyst, shared an optimistic outlook on the altcoin market. On X, the cryptocurrency commentator pointed to the consolidation pattern in the chart of Render RNDR/USD, a project focused on decentralized GPU rendering. He noted the similarity of this pattern to “a lot of good charts,” suggesting a potential breakout for RNDR and potentially other altcoins in the near future.“RNDR: you know, a lot of good charts have this same type of price action,” Altcoin Sherpa said. “I think now is a great time to scale into many altcoins that you like and just sit on them. The next leg seems like it’s going to come in the next few weeks.”SolanaAltcoin Sherpa also offered his insights on Solana SOL/USD, a major Ethereum competitor. He believes SOL could experience a price dip before a potential rally.“SOL: I think this remains a good area to buy and scale in,” he said. “Would DCA (dollar cost average) from here to $140 personally.” Dollar-cost averaging (DCA) is an investment strategy where investors buy a fixed amount of an asset at regular intervals, regardless of the asset’s price. Here, Altcoin Sherpa suggests buying SOL gradually as the price potentially dips towards $140.In another tweet, Altcoin Sherpa expressed bullish sentiment towards RSS3 RSS/USD, a decentralized information processing protocol. He believes RSS3 is currently consolidating and poised for a price increase.“RSS3 is consolidating here in my opinion,” he stated. “I think the next leg is coming. In this one personally and have a node. Bullish.”Also Read: Can You Make Millions In Minutes? This Trader Found Out The Hard WayPentoshi Cautions On Short-Term Altcoin PerformanceNot all analysts share Altcoin Sherpa’s immediate optimism. Crypto analyst Pentoshi took a more cautious stance on altcoins in the short term. While acknowledging the long-term bullish trend, Pentoshi believes a pullback and consolidation period might be imminent for altcoins.“First bearish post in a very long time,” Pentoshi said.“This is only a short term view,” Pentoshi said. “Not high time frame. But I do believe we likely see the market pull back again and then consolidate in terms of alts.”Pentoshi clarified that he doesn’t advocate for exiting positions entirely. Rather, he suggests having stablecoins ready to capitalize on potential buying opportunities that might arise during a pullback.“I don’t think it’s worth ‘exiting positions,'” he said. “But more just haven’t stables ready for opportunities that may present themselves. The trend is clearly up on all time frames.”What’s Next: With the Bitcoin halving only weeks away, its impact on the altcoin market will be monitored by traders and investors alike.These topics are expected to be thoroughly explored at Benzinga’s upcoming Future of Digital Assets event on Nov. 19.Read Next: Coinbase Legal Setback: Court Rejects Motion To Dismiss SEC’s Securities AllegationsImage: Shutterstock

There Are Now 11 Bitcoin ETFs Trading as One More Launches - Decrypt

Crypto asset management Hashdex announced on Tuesday that it launched its Bitcoin ETF on the New York Stock Exchange, making it the eleventh Bitcoin ETF to go live since the SEC approved the bulk of fund applications in January.Hashdex's entry originally launched in September 2022 as a Bitcoin Futures ETF trading on the New York Stock Exchange as DEFI. The Brazil-based firm said it had converted that product to a spot Bitcoin ETF to offer investors more immediate exposure to the number one cryptocurrency.Unlike other spot Bitcoin ETFs, however, Hashdex launched its product within the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME). And the new fund will continue to incorporate Bitcoin futures.“Going forward and under normal market conditions, the fund’s investment policy is to maximize its holdings of physical Bitcoin such that it is expected that at least 95% of the fund’s assets will be invested in spot Bitcoin,” Hashdex said. “Up to 5% of the fund’s remaining assets may be invested in CME-traded Bitcoin futures contracts and in cash and cash equivalents.”A Bitcoin Futures ETF refers to investments in futures contracts that offer indirect Bitcoin exposure, whereas a spot Bitcoin ETF holds actual Bitcoin, providing direct market price exposure.Hashdex says the Bitcoin ETF holds 5,500 Bitcoins, currently worth around $377.2 million.The spot Bitcoin ETF is sponsored by Tidal ETF Services, Hashdex said, which serves as the fund’s administrator along with BitGo, which acts as the custodian of the Bitcoin underpinning the ETF.“We are thrilled to complete the conversion of DEFI and, with it, deliver an innovative product in coordination with Tidal that furthers our mission of empowering individuals and institutions around the world to access this revolutionary innovation,” Hashdex co-founder and CEO Marcelo Sampaio said in a statement.In January, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission approved ten spot Bitcoin ETFs from investment firms, including BlackRock, Bitwise, Grayscale, VanEck, Franklin Templeton, and ARK 21 Shares.While Hashdex did file a Bitcoin ETF application with the SEC, the regulatory agency was still reviewing the final registration statement when the other firms' applications were approved in January, delaying the company’s launch plans.“DEFI originally received its 19b-4 approval first alongside other issuers, and this latest announcement is regarding the product going effective and converting from a futures to a spot Bitcoin ETF,” a Hashdex spokesperson told Decrypt. “To that end, its tracking of a new benchmark index became effective today, March 27, 2024.”Edited by Ryan Ozawa.Stay on top of crypto news, get daily updates in your inbox.

Litecoin ETF Rumors Swirl After Multiple CFTC Nods - DailyCoin


        
The Bitcoin ETFs have been hugely successful.



Rumors of a Litecoin ETF grow louder.



Some believe altcoin ETF approval is inevitable.
The arrival of Bitcoin ETFs in January ushered in a watershed moment for the crypto industry, with billions of dollars flowing into the leading cryptocurrency since. Analysts widely credit this Wall Street embrace as the driving force behind Bitcoin’s recent bull run to new all-time highs. Hot on the heels of this resounding success, whispers about institutions gearing up for a Litecoin ETF are growing louder.Litecoin ETF RumorsFueling the speculation is a recent tweet from Fox Business journalist Eleanor Terrett, who claimed to have heard “rumblings on the institutional level” about growing interest in Litecoin ETFs. According to Terrett, the rationale behind this stems from Litecoin’s “functional similarities” to Bitcoin, making it a safer proposition for Securities Exchange Commission (SEC) approval versus an Ethereum ETF.Lending further weight to this narrative is Coinbase’s recent announcement of plans to launch Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC)-approved futures contracts for Dogecoin, Litecoin, and Bitcoin Cash. Terrett inferred that this regulatory green light from the CFTC suggests that authorities view these cryptocurrencies as legitimate tokens.Further bolstering the case for Litecoin’s regulatory standing is the recent Department of Justice lawsuit against the KuCoin exchange. According to reports, the CFTC explicitly classified Litecoin and Ethereum as commodities in the legal proceedings, adding ammunition to the argument that Litecoin is a viable candidate for an ETF product.While the regulatory stance appears to favor Litecoin as a commodity, opinions remain divided on the potential trajectory and long-term implications of an altcoin ETF frenzy.Are Altcoin ETFs the Next Big Thing? Weighing in on the prospects of a wave of altcoin ETFs coming to market, Luke Martin posed a thought-provoking question during a recent Stacks podcast, asking why Wall Street would stop at Bitcoin ETFs, especially considering their runaway success.



3AC co-founder Su Zhu agreed with Martin, stating that altcoin ETFs are inevitable as the SEC “won’t want to fight fights it can’t win.” However, Zhu tempered his outlook, suggesting that while initial altcoin ETF launches may experience a significant pump, akin to the cannabis stock frenzy, the effect could dissipate for latecomers as the novelty wears off and market dynamics shift. On the Flipside
The odds of an Ethereum ETF being approved were slashed to 25% owing to renewed doubts about ETH‘s securities status.



A token’s commodity status is not necessarily an automatic green light for ETF approval.



Investor appetite for a Litecoin ETF remains speculative at this stage, with institutions‘ actual appetite yet to be determined.
Why This MattersThe prospect of a Litecoin ETF holds immense significance. An SEC-approved product would legitimize Litecoin as a mainstream investment asset, potentially drawing billions in institutional capital to catalyze widespread adoption and cement Litecoin’s position in the crypto hierarchy, which has been on the wane in recent years.The Litecoin Foundation comments on LTC’s lagging price action.

Bitcoin market analysis: Grayscale report signals bull run continuation

The last market description from Grayscale shows that Bitcoin (BTC ) is in the middle of a bull run right now. The latest report from Grayscale supports the strong sentiment of the crypto due to both the fundamental and technical factors that are currently ongoing.Precursors of bull marketGrayScale’s research identifies a few causes that usually act as a beacon that triggers the commencement of a bullish trend. The dominance of Bitcoin, for instance, can be traced as preceding the cryptocurrency market movement as a whole. Initially, a bull run in BTC would bring altcoins out of hibernation in search of higher yields as traders look for the next opportunity. This phenomenon was observed during the 2021-2022 bull upswing, where a significant uptick followed Bitcoin’s predominating rise in altcoins increase in their valuations.Considering past developments and the three key catalysts that differ from the current market cycle, Grayscale employers can expect astounding characteristics in the crypto space. The key background is related to BTC ETFs but positive stablecoin inflows and a drop in BTC balance on exchanges.Spot Bitcoin ETF inflowsThis trend commenced immediately after the spot Bitcoin ETFs were passed in January and extends to the present time, when the inflow of capital into the funds surpassed BTC emission, with upward movement seen in the prices. This pushes the institutional capital inflow as the key component that has shifted market dynamics tremendously from previous investment rounds.Although stablecoin investment, as seen by the growing funds in the reserve of crypto exchanges, has contributed to the influx of capital, generally, “stablecoins in the crypto market are believed to be vehicles for capital inflow, particularly during a bull market.” Also, a declining BTC held on the exchange hand in hand with subsequent transfers to custodian cold wallets for more storage confirms a strong supply-demand setup that fosters the price rise.Grayscale, on the threshold of the knowledge, employs Net Unrealized Profit/Loss (NUPL) for its assessment of the particular stock market stage. It proposes that the market is in the “mid-phase” or “fifth inning” phase of the current bull run. The NUPL ratio is comprehensive enough to display the climax of this cycle, but the overall market outlook is still on the grey side compared to previous peaks.Retail investor participationStatements and Google Trends analytics show that the passion of the retail investor Bitcoin has still not reached the level typical for 2021. Conversely, though the sentiment analysis shows a similar expression to the one of the last bull market hydra, it implies the possibility of the retail investors returning.Grayscale summarises that the draw run is probably to last, whereas they record favorable market patterns and the constant interest of investors. Nevertheless, they are encouraged to watch the Bitcoin ETF spot flow and look for any macroeconomic developments or signals of a market shift.Although progress has been posted lately, Grayscale is confident space exists for protracted amelioration. Going forward in this novel field, participants` attentiveness and calculated orientation will be critical in managing the ever-changing world of cryptocurrencies markets.

US Lawmakers Urge SEC to Confront Prometheum's Custody Plans for ETH


																United States House Financial Services Committee and House Agriculture Committee members have expressed notable concerns regarding the Securities and Exchange Commission’s (SEC) approach to managing Ethereum (ETH).
The focus of their apprehension centers on crypto firm Prometheum’s plans to offer institutional custody services for ETH, which has sparked several demands for clarity and action from regulatory authorities.
Regulatory Ambiguity
In a letter addressed to SEC Chair Gary Gensler dated March 26, prominent lawmakers, including House Financial Services Committee Chair Patrick McHenry and Vice Chair French Hill, urged the Commission to confront Prometheum’s intentions to provide custody services for ETH through its subsidiary, Prometheum Capital.
They warned that such actions could have serious and potentially irreversible implications for the digital asset markets. The lawmakers’ concerns revolve around the ambiguity surrounding the SEC’s stance on Special Purpose Broker-Dealers (SPBD) and their ability to custody non-security digital assets like ETH.
Despite previous assertions by the SEC and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) recognizing ETH as a non-security digital asset, questions linger regarding the regulatory classification and allowed activities within the existing framework.






The letter highlights the lack of clarity in the SEC’s rule concerning SPBD custody of non-securities and the agency’s apparent inactivity in addressing potential non-compliance issues within this matter.
Lawmakers also expressed concern over the absence of comprehensive guidance or a defined regulatory framework for digital asset securities, increasing uncertainty within the digital asset space.
Lawmakers Demand Clarity on ETH
Furthermore, the lawmakers draw attention to Chairman Gensler’s reluctance to definitively classify ETH, which has only increased the confusion surrounding its regulatory treatment. Despite previous acknowledgments of ETH as a non-security digital asset, the SEC’s failure to provide unquestionable clarity has left market participants dealing with uncertainty.
The result of the SEC’s stance extends beyond regulatory ambiguity, potentially impacting the broader digital asset marketplace. Lawmakers warn that classifying ETH as a digital asset security could disrupt existing commodity futures markets and imperil essential risk management tools, ultimately stifling innovation and market growth.
The letter concludes with a call to action, urging the SEC to promptly address the concerns raised and provide much-needed clarity on the regulatory treatment of ETH. Failure to do so, lawmakers warn, risks undermining the integrity and competitiveness of U.S. digital asset markets, with far-reaching consequences for investors and market participants alike.

Sam Bankman-Fried is pushing for lenient jail time ahead of his sentencing Thursday by submitting several letters of support to the court.
                        Sam Bankman-Fried’s legal team has submitted several last-minute letters of support for the disgraced FTX founder in hopes of leniency at his March 28 sentencing, court documents filed Wednesday reveal.Supportive Pleas Surface as Sam Bankman-Fried Awaits Sentence
Spanning from Sam Bankman-Fried’s friends from MIT to parents with children with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD), the latest letters addressed to Judge Lewis A. Kaplan go as far as to call the FTX founder a “kind” and “wonderful person.”“The hope that customer funds will be reimbursed in some measure mitigates the severity of Sam’s guilt, and it seems the length of his sentence should reflect this fact,” the parent of an FTX customer who lost their life savings on the doomed crypto exchange wrote.“Though I have never met Sam, I firmly believe that while he may be an MIT grad – he did not fully understand the scope of what was going on and did not have malicious intent,” said a mother of a son with ASD.Sam Bankman-Fried is facing a potential maximum penalty of over 100 years in federal prison following his November 2023 whirlwind trial that saw the FTX founder convicted on seven different fraud charges.His lawyers have since requested a maximum prison sentence of six years for orchestrating the $8 billion digital asset fraud, citing his ASD and “genuine concern” for others.Prosecution Counters with Strong Rebuke to SBF’s Support Letters
Shortly after Bankman-Fried’s legal team filed additional letters on the FTX founder’s behalf pushing for leniency on Wednesday, prosecutors submitted their own court filings in the form of additional victim impact statements.“My whole life has been destroyed,” one FTX depositor wrote, stating that he “did not agree to the risk that Sam Bankman-Fried took” with his funds.“Sam Bankman-Fried’s callous disregard for the impact of his actions on individuals like myself, who have diligently worked to build a future, is reprehensible and deserving of maximum sentencing,” wrote another.How Long Will Bankman-Fried Get In Prison?While Bankman-Fried is facing hefty prison time for his role in FTX’s ultimate collapse, the actual length of his sentence will largely be under the discretion of Judge Kaplan and the court’s recommended guidelines.“Kaplan’s tough – and he has that reputation – but he’s not nasty,” former U.S. assistant attorney and white-collar crime expert Kevin J. O’Brien said in an interview with Cryptonews. “I don’t think he’s effectively going to put the guy away for the rest of his adult life. He’s going to give him an opportunity to make amends and live a meaningful life outside of prison.”When asked how long of a prison sentence the FTX founder would get, O’Brien suggested two decades in prison. “I wouldn’t be surprised if Sam Bankman-Fried got 15 years,” he concluded.Cryptonews will be reporting live from the courtroom of Bankman-Fried’s March 28 sentencing starting at 9:30 a.m ET.

                        Laser Digital – the crypto-focused subsidiary of Japanese asset manager Nomura – has launched an institutionally focused liquid staking fund on Polygon in collaboration with TruFin.The fund, titled the Laser Digital Polygon Adoption Fund, will provide institutional clients with exposure to Polygon’s native gas token, MATIC, while also tapping into native staking rewards.Liquid Staking With Laser Digital
Per a press release shared with Cryptonews, the fund is specifically targeted toward sovereign wealth funds, institutional funds, and private asset managers.“Institutional investors are beginning to understand the benefits and necessity of decentralized security, and this Fund shows that institutions are compelled by the broader ecosystem,” noted Laser Digital.According to stakingrewards.com, the estimated annual staking reward for MATIC stakers is currently 5.94%. However, using the TruStake liquid staking solution, fund investors can access yield consistnetly higher than Lido’s 5% average while maintaining the freedom to sell their tokens at any time.TruFin has already partnered with Balacner and Chainlink to maximize the liquidity of the TruMATIC token.The fund takes advantage of the Polygon AggLayer, which aggregates zero-knowledge proofs from all connected blockchains, boosting liqudiidty and transaction speed while maximizing the fund’s operational efficiency. It will first become available to investors in the United Kingdom following relevant registrations and regulatory approvals.“Laser Digital Asset Management aims to transform DeFi investment opportunities into investable TradFi solutions,” said Sebastien Guglietta, Head of Laser Digital Asset Management.“Leveraging TruFin technology and its integration with Polygon’s AggLayer, we are making Polygon-Matic digital asset investment accessible, in the most secure, and efficient way for institutional investors.”Another Boon For Polygon Adoption
Colin Butler, Global Head of Institutional Capital at Polygon, added that getting institutional investors involved with staking would boost the overall security of the Polygon network.Polygon is one of the leading layer 2 scaling networks for Ethereum (ETH) – the largest smart contract blockchain by volume and market cap.Thanks to Ethereum’s recent Denucun upgrade, the cost of “rollups” on Polygon – batches of transactions that are later settled to the Ethereum blockchain – is expected to drastically fall following the latter’s Feijoa update. It’s also a slight boon for Polygon staking, since Ethereum L1 settlement costs became slightly cheaper.While liquid staking is DeFi’s most popular use case, prominent developers like Vitalik Buterin have warned that the phenomenon is pushing networks like Ethereum toward centralization.

The Protocol: Meme Coins (and Pepe's Best Friend) Swarm Coinbase Layer 2 Chain

It's not something we have historically written a lot about – bridging yields. But a new report from the crypto investment firm Exponential.fi included a chart on these yields, and it caught our eye because they've been rising fast recently, pushing above 15%. Co-founder Mehdi Lebbar attributes the rising yields to higher demand from users, in part a reflection of the trend toward greater interoperability between blockchains, along with the proliferation of layer-2 and layer-3 networks. "As the DeFi ecosystem extends across networks, third-party bridging protocols like Across and Synapse are reaping higher fees," the report reads. These yields are paid out to liquidity providers who supply the bridges with cryptocurrencies, according to Lebbar: "The bridge allows transfers of bitcoins across chains, and people pay commissions on that. Commissions are reversed by the bridge/protocol to liquidity providers." Asked if the higher yields might reflect increased risk, Lebbar said: "The increased yield would reflect 'protocol risk' if we were in a mature, highly efficient market, but that’s not the case for bridging."

Fidelity registers for spot Ethereum ETF - Crypto Briefing




Fidelity Investments (Fidelity) has filed a registration with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to apply for a spot Ethereum (ETH) exchange-traded fund (ETF). Notably, the filing featured an option to stake a portion of the fund’s assets.According to the S-1 filing, the proposed ETF would be available for trading on the Cboe BZX Exchange, with Fidelity’s digital asset division serving as the custodion of the trust’s Ethereum holdings. However, Fidelity has not specified which staking infrastructure they will be using or partnering with.However, incorporating staking in the ETF structure introduces additional risks, which were outlined in the application. According to Fidelity’s registration statement, current regulatory measures in the US and elsewhere may adversely impact the fund’s status.Causes for termination may come from the SEC itself, if the Commission determines that Fidelity’s fund may be in violation of the 1940 Act. This piece of legislation was enacted in August 22, 1940 and has since codified how Congress regulates investment funds in the US.This act, along with other financial regulations like the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and the Investment Advisers Act of 1940, plays a central role in the country’s financial regulation. Primarily, the 1940 Act seeks to protect investors and the investing public’s interest by requiring investment firms to disclose material information and assessing whether firms under its jurisdiction present or are operating with conflicts of interest.The 1940 Act covers a range of investment entities, including mutual funds, closed-end funds, hedge funds, private equity funds, and holding companies. Notably, under the law, mutual funds are required to limit leverage and maintain sufficient cash reserves to accommodate investors wishing to sell their shares.This law may present contentious and critical points to an Ethereum ETF, even if it has been updated in the past decade. This represents a risk for Fidelity in that it could encompass potential losses for the firm’s proposed Ethereum ETF by slashing penalties and liquidity risks within the staking process.The SEC is currently unclear as to whether Ethereum (Ether/ETH) is a security, with GOP lawmakers demanding the regulator clarify its stance. The status of staking rewards as income is also unclear, and the rewards would be taxable for investors, even in the absence of an associated distribution from the trust. Recently, the Ethereum Foundation was mired in an investigation by an undisclosed “state authority” that was later alleged by Fortune to be an initiative of the SEC as it campaigns to classify Ethereum as a security. The Commission has delayed approval from seven other applicants, with a decision timeline set for May 23 this year.

Dogecoin On-Chain Metrics Explode As Bulls Drive 36% Rally | Bitcoinist.com


								Dogecoin has been heating up recently and this has been apparent in both its price, as well as its on-chain meme metrics. With investor interest now turning back to the OG meme coin, there has been some marked increase in its on-chain metrics, which suggests that the rally might just be starting.
Dogecoin On-Chain Metrics See Significant Increase
Among the Dogecoin on-chain metrics that have seen a significant uptick in recent days, three in particular stand out the most. These include the transaction count, number of whale transactions, and the age consumed of DOGE tokens.

Transaction count and whale transactions saw a notable shift as the price began to recover. As data from the on-chain tracking platform Santiment shows, these active transactions rose significantly from 1.22 billion to 9.2 billion in the space of two days. Looking at the DOGE chart, it shows a correlation during this time between the increase in its price and its transaction count.
Following the same path, the whale transactions, also know as large transactions rallied at this time. These transactions which are carrying DOGE tokens worth $100,000 or more spiked from around 1,500 daily transactions at the start of March to over 4,000 daily transactions toward the end of the month.
The third metric that has seen an increase during this time is the age consumed. The “Age Consumed” here refers to the amount of time that DOGE tokens are being held by investors. So rather than selling their coins, more Dogecoin investors are choosing to hold onto them in anticipation of more upside.

DOGE Bulls Face Resistance
Despite Dogecoin showing considerable strength recently, it continues to face considerable resistance from bears who struggle to pull down the price. The main price point of contention now is $0.2, where the bears have mounted resistance.

Since hitting this level in early March, Dogecoin has been unable to revisit it, making it the level to beat. Nevertheless, the coin is sitting above its 50-day moving average, which means DOGE is skewing toward buy for the short term.
In addition to its on-chain metrics heating up, the Dogecoin daily trading volume witnessed a 13% increase in the last day, suggesting increased interest. If these metrics continue to rise, it could translate to demand for DOGE and this could trigger a rally above $0.2.
At the time of writing, Dogecoin is holding steady above $0.18 and maintaining a 36% gain on the 7-day chart.

Binance Unleashes SHIB, DOGE & PEPE Pairs for Margin Trading - DailyCoin


        
Memecurrency sector observed the hottest week in history this March.



Top crypto platform Binance adds new memecoin Margin trading pairs.



Solana’s emerging canine coins make their way to new all-time highs.
The globe’s leading cryptocurrency exchange has introduced a lengthy list of new trading pairs for Margin. The latest announcement is relevant to both Cross Margin and Isolated Margin in a quest to boost the ecosystem’s liquidity by meeting the rising demand for advanced memecurrency trading.Binance Meets Trading Demand with These PairsFirst, Dogecoin (DOGE) traders can trade DOGE/USDC in both Cross and Isolated margins. Custodians of Shiba Inu (SHIB) can also partake in SHIB/USDC trading in both modes.However, things might look slightly different for crypto aficionados seeking to trade Pepe (PEPE), as this memecoin has now expanded to four trading pairs. In further detail, both Cross and Isolated traders can use PEPE trading against two popular stablecoins: USD Coin (USDC) and First Digital USD (FDUSD).This means that PEPE traders can choose between PEPE/FDUSD and PEPE/USDC pairs on both versions of Margin trading. Meanwhile, fans of brand new, straight-out-the-gate memecoins get BOME/FDUSD, a Solana-based memecurrency.Is the Ongoing Memecurrency Rally Sustainable?The all-around memecoin frenzy in the last couple of months has made the major players adapt to the shifting crypto landscape. Most large and mid-cap memecurrencies have surged in triple digits, as top crypto exchanges have welcomed a series of promising projects, including Book Of Meme (BOME) and Dogwifhat (WIF).As memecurrencies have lately witnessed the most successful week ever in this department, the Spring 2024 memecoin rally is yet to face a longer market correction. For instance, Dogecoin has embarked on a 40% weekly run to claim the yearly heights of $0.188 today. Meanwhile, Shiba Inu’s 289% run placed the original Doge Killer right next to its main rival in the charts.



Younger siblings Dogwifhat and Bonk (BONK) quickly made a name for themselves by securing new all-time highs recently, making these Solana’s canine coins long-term TOP 100 contenders. While the memecoin bull rally is fun to watch, it bears mentioning that memecurrencies are volatile and known for their highly fluctuating market prices.On the Flipside
Book Of Meme (BOME) trading has raised substantial controversy due to allegations of insider trading on BOME’s launch day on Binance.

SBF Supporters Use Autism as Excuse for Lenient Sentencing - DailyCoin


        
SBF’s sentencing trial will take place in a few days.



The former FTX CEO’s loved ones are advocating for lenient judgment as the sentencing nears.



SBF faces multiple decades behind bars.
Following his conviction on multiple counts of fraud in the collapse of FTX, the question of SBF’s fate has lingered across the industry as his sentencing nears. While prosecutors assert that the fallen crypto mogul deserves at least 40 to 50 years behind bars, SBF’s legal team has gone on a ‘lenient-sentence’ advocacy campaign with a string of tactics, seeking to mitigate the sentence he faces.Continuing the trend, more supporters have joined the ‘pro–SBF’ campaign, seeking little to no time behind bars for the convicted CEO.SBF Sentencing Plea: “He Did Not Understand What Was Going On”In various letters on Tuesday, March 26, five individuals called on US Judge Lewis Kaplan to temper SBF’s judgment with mercy, factoring faults in the disgraced crypto mogul’s neurological traits.One stand-out excuse was the assertion that SBF had been diagnosed as on the autistic spectrum, which allegedly played a significant role in the actions that led up to his conviction. Advocate Maria Centrella emphasized that SBF’s autism should be considered as a mitigating factor in his sentencing, adding that the former FTX CEO was likely unaware of the crimes he was committing.“I firmly believe that while he may be an MIT grad - he did not fully understand the scope of what was going on and did not have malicious intent,” stated Centrella.Another Matt Kelly, in a letter with three others, emphasized that the manner of his trial and the psychological troubles stemming from it, as evidenced by the testimony of Caroline Ellison and other SBF co-workers, should be taken into account during his sentencing. They emphasized that determining the most appropriate type of institution for SBF should receive additional consideration. However, the recent pleas are not isolated; they represent the latest legal efforts to secure minimal time behind bars for SBF.SBF Sentencing CampaignOver the past month, SBF’s lawyers have raised pleas for leniency ahead of his sentencing trial, marked by limitless arguments citing his mental health conditions.



On February 28, SBF’s defense counsel submitted a sentencing memorandum to the United States District Court Of the Southern District of New York, touting SBF’s image in the lobby for a sentence no longer than 63-78 months, approximately five to six and a half years. “Those who know Sam know he is selfless, altruistic, and a young man who has demonstrated throughout his life “a genuine concern for those less fortunate around the world,” the memorandum stated, adding that, “as a society, we need more people like him,” the lawyers stated.Bankman-Fried’s family and friends have submitted an additional 27 letters expressing concern for his well-being and asserting that his personal traits make him unsuitable for prison. On The Flipside
Despite the arguments that SBF’s autistic spectrum factored into his crimes, the condition is renowned for its positive effects and is not indicative of incapability or irresponsibility.



SBF’s team has argued that the 2022 FTX collapse was due to bad business decisions and not maliciously driven.



Nearly two years after its collapse, an extensive list of creditors awaits compensation for the $8 billion loss incurred.
Why This MattersThe arguments of neurological disorders as excuses for fraud ahead of SBF’s sentencing underscore the relentless efforts by his team to mitigate the consequences of his actions. However, it is a dangerous and outdated viewpoint that is unlikely to hold up as an excuse for his litany of crimes in the eyes of a judge.

Ethena Labs Announces Airdrop Date of Native Token ENA - The Defiant

Starting April 2, 750 million ENA or 5% of the total supply, will get airdropped.Synthetic stablecoin startup Ethena Labs has announced it is one step closer to the holy grail of internet money.After six weeks of Ethena’s “Shard Campaign,” or points system, which saw the total supply of its stablecoin, USDe, balloon to $1.3 billion, the ecosystem is ready to begin distributing its second native token, tickered ENA.Launching the ENA token, according to the team, marks the beginning of the decentralization of the Ethena protocol.Beginning April 2, ENA will be eligible for claim on the project’s official claim website, as centralized exchanges get ready for listing. On this date, the project will distribute 750 million ENA, or 5% of the total 15 billion supply.The 5% allocated to the airdrop will come from the overall 30% that belongs to Ecosystem Development.ENA Distribution ENA will play a pivotal role in governance, according to the team. Voting using the token will go to deciding general risk management frameworks, USDe backing composition, exchange and custodian exposure, community grants, and size of Reserve Fund, among other uses.Calling it the holy grail of internet money is a lofty claim.According to Guy Young, Ethena Labs’ founder, the holy grail of crypto is building or attaining the status of money.“BTC and ETH converge to trying to become money,” he told The Defiant, and that Ethena’s mission–and holy grail–is creating their own native version of internet money.For eligibility, users that stake, hold USDe in incentivized pools, LP pools, or Pendle Finance, must leave their tokens in their respective wallets and protocols.Additionally, holders of two NFT collections–SchizoPosters and Redacted Remilio Babies–will receive 3% of the initial airdrop amount.Ethena’s Controversial Stablecoin USDeEthena Labs’ caused a stir in the crypto industry on February 19 after it announced a 27% yield on its native stablecoin, USDe.Double digit yield-bearing assets reminded Crypto Twitter of Terra’s UST algorithmic stablecoin, which saw its demise in early May 2022, causing a death spiral that wiped out $50 billion in market capitalization in three days.But the synthetic stablecoin has been lauded by many for its architecture, which backs the token that is pegged to $1 with staked Ethereum, while also hedging stETH with short ETH positions on centralized exchanges. Both stETH and short positions contribute to yield that’s passed on to stablecoin holders.Austin Campbell, founder and managing partner of Zero Knowledge Consulting firm, said Ethena is a “truly interesting experiment” and is substituting credit risk with price risk.His view echoed that of Ryan Watkins, co-founder of Syncracy Capital, who said USDe should be conceptualized as a structured product, and that it offers a “key source” of liquidity.

Casa Launches Global Inheritance Solution for Secure Digital Asset Transfer | Cryptopolitan

Casa, a leading provider of self-custodial digital asset solutions, is taking a significant step forward by making its innovative inheritance product available to customers worldwide. This move aims to address what Casa identifies as the most pressing issue in self-custody: ensuring the safe transfer of digital assets, such as bitcoin, ether, and stablecoins USDT and USDC, to heirs.Simplifying Crypto inheritanceThe Casa Inheritance feature offers a streamlined approach to passing on digital assets. It stands as a robust alternative to traditional methods involving custodial providers or hardware wallets, which are often criticized for their vulnerability to loss. The company highlights a staggering $140 billion in bitcoin lost, largely due to misplaced keys, underscoring the need for a more secure solution.Previously exclusive to U.S. investors with significant bitcoin investments,the company’s expanded service builds upon its multi-key vault technology. This technology allows members to set up secure, conditional access to their digital vault for a chosen recipient, such as a family member, trustee, or estate executor, starting at $250 per year.How Casa inheritance worksCasa’s multi-key vaults enhance security by distributing control over assets across up to five keys, offering a more secure alternative to single-key solutions. This setup was extended last year to include ether and stablecoins alongside bitcoin, in response to client demand and technical advancements in Ethereum support.The multi-signature (multisig) approach requires approvals from multiple devices for transactions, safeguarding funds even if one key is compromised. Casa also provides an emergency recovery service, holding a backup key for users, adding an extra layer of security.To utilize the inheritance feature, members grant conditional access to their vault and share encrypted, locked keys with a designated recipient through the Casa app. In the event of the member’s incapacitation, the recipient can initiate a transfer request. This request triggers a six-month waiting period, during which Casa attempts to notify the member of the pending transfer. Only after this period does the recipient gain access to the vault.Beyond spot ETFsCasa’s commentary on the recent launch of U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs is critical, noting that while these funds offer a convenient way to include bitcoin in retirement accounts or other regulated investment vehicles, they miss out on bitcoin’s core value proposition as truly ownable digital money. This, according to Casa, can only be fully realized through self-custody.The company also points out the centralization risks associated with spot Bitcoin ETFs, many of which rely on a single custodian, such as Coinbase, for the custody of bitcoin. Casa co-founder and CEO Nick Neuman emphasizes the growing trend among sophisticated investors towards self-custody for safeguarding generational wealth, especially for those viewing bitcoin as a long-term hedge against the financial system. Casa’s global expansion of its inheritance solution marks a critical development in the digital asset space, offering a secure and user-friendly option for managing the transfer of crypto assets across generations.

Top Analyst Says Ethereum Rival Looks Turbo Bullish, Updates Outlook on Arbitrum and Solana-Based Memecoin - The Daily Hodl


								A top trader who accurately called Bitcoin’s (BTC) floor price during the 2018 bear market says one Ethereum (ETH) challenger looks extremely bullish.
Pseudonymous analyst Bluntz tells his 251,100 followers on the social media platform X that he expects the native asset of the layer-1 protocol Near (NEAR) to rally to a level last seen in May 2022.










According to the analyst, NEAR appears to be in the midst of a five-wave surge that could see the altcoin soaring close to $10 in a matter of days.
“NEAR looks turbo bullish here IMO (in my opinion), clear ABC down from the highs, spent all weekend accumulating and now breaking out.
Should be one of the first to make new highs IMO.” 
Source: Bluntz/X
Bluntz uses the Elliott Wave theory to predict the future price action of crypto assets. According to the theory, a bullish asset tends to witness a five-wave rally after completing an ABC corrective move.
At time of writing, NEAR is worth $7.60, an increase of over 3% in the past day.
The trader is also keeping a close watch on the Ethereum scaling solution Arbitrum (ARB). Bluntz says ARB is flashing multiple bullish reversal signals on the daily chart.
“ARB not only looks like a nice clear as day ABC down but there’s also a daily bullish divergence now on that daily close print.
ETH beta about to get some love again IMO.” 
Source: Bluntz/X
Traders often watch out for assets that give off a bullish divergence reading. It suggests that a bullish reversal is in sight as the asset gains momentum despite the price trending down or sideways.
At time of writing, ARB is worth $1.70.
Bluntz says he’s also expecting rallies for the Solana (SOL)-based meme token Slerf (SLERF).
“Initial hype and first pullback on SLEF looks over. Took a punt now it’s cooled off.” 
Source: Bluntz/X
At time of writing, SLERF is worth $0.767, up over 17% in the last 24 hours.

Ethereum ‘BlobScriptions’ lift off and it’s taking Blob fees with it

A viral new method for minting data to the Ethereum blockchain dubbed “BlobScriptions” is pushing up the price of Blob fees — the amount required for a blob to be included in an Ethereum block. BlobScriptions were introduced on March 27 by a protocol called Ethscriptions, allowing users to inscribe data — from JPEGs to text — directly onto “blobs,” which were introduced to the Ethereum network as part of the network’s Dencun upgrade on March 13. Less than five hours after the introduction of BlobScriptions, the gas fees for Blobs soared as high as 585 gwei — equivalent to roughly $18, according to data from Ultrasound.money.This was a far cry from the average gas price for minting data on a blob before BlobScriptions, which averaged around one wei, equivalent to a tiny fraction of $0.01. Blob fees soared following the introduction of BlobScriptions. Source: Ultrasound.moneyHowever, Blob fees have since fallen considerably from its newly notched high. At the time of publication, blob fees are running at 35.8 gwei, equivalent to $1.20, per Coinbrain conversion data. Meanwhile, users have made over 4,500 inscriptions on blobs since the introduction of BlobScriptions, according to Dune Analytics data. In a March 27 post to X, Ethscriptions founder Tom Lehman — who goes by the alias Middlemarch — noted the spiking cost of “blobspace,” and urged users to mint BlobScriptions via the official blobscription protocol. Source: MiddlemarchMuch in a similar way to the early days of Bitcoin Ordinals, Ethereum users are opting to mint small pieces of text and seemingly random assortments of images to blobs, with the most recent activity on blobscription.io showing hundreds of new images added in the last few hours. Ethereum users are flooding the protocol to mint data on blobs. Source: BlobScriptionsNotably, blob data is only stored on Ethereum nodes for around 18 days meaning that after that period, BlobScriptions data will be removed from the network. However, Lehman added that the Ethscriptions indexer would store the data “indefinitely.” Related: Starknet targets increased throughput, lower fees with parallel transactions in 2024Blobs were introduced by way of EIP-4844 — a core data-saving feature of Ethereum’s Dencun upgrade — which was focused primarily on reducing transaction costs on layer-2 networks by a significant margin.Transaction fees on Ethereum L2s fell drastically following the Dencun upgrade, with swap fees on Arbitrum plunging from around $1.25 to below $0.02, while Polygon fees fell by a similar amount. As a way of lauding the decreased fees that came with blobs, one developer Ethereum managed to mint the entire script of the Bee Movie on an Ethereum blob less than 15 minutes after the upgrade went live all for less than $13 in ETH gas fees.

Due to the meme coin’s increasing popularity, many exchanges including Binance, Coinbase, and Bybit have listed it on its platform. Additionally, its growing interest among traders and investors effectively underscores the cryptocurrency’s burgeoning potential and appeal. 
In addition to Shiba Inu, Bitcoin.com.au offers a plethora of other cryptocurrency options, including leading digital assets like Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), XRP, and Dogecoin (DOGE). 
Shiba Inu Extends Its Reach Into Australian Markets

45 Days Until Altcoin Season: How to Prepare


As the horizon brightens with the anticipation of another altcoin season, investors are on the lookout for the next big cryptocurrency. 
With a diverse range of tokens gaining traction, the market is ripe with opportunities for those willing to dive into the depths of blockchain technology and its myriad applications.
45 Days Until Altcoin Season
According to renowned analyst Rekt Fencer, altcoin season might be around the corner. This optimistic outlook suggests it is now the time to select the right low-cap cryptocurrencies, aiming for the elusive 100x returns that many dream of.
For this reason, it is crucial to understand the sequence of a typical bull run. Ran Neuner, a South African entrepreneur, explained that altcoin season traditionally starts with a surge in the price of Bitcoin. This is followed by Ethereum and then high-cap cryptocurrencies such as Solana and Avalanche. 

“[Bitcoin is] attacking the all-time high with huge momentum. Now, the reality is that as soon as that all-time high is breached [again], and it could happen as soon as today, it is like the gun goes off for altcoins, and the race begins,” Neuner said.

Neuner pointed out that becuase Bitcoin surpassed its previous all-time high, altcoins could also reach new highs about 70 days later. It is worth noting 22 days following Bitcoin’s peak, altcoins often undergo a correction period.

Bitcoin vs Altcoins Market. Source: TradingView
The crypto market is currently 14 days into this correction phase, and the market is beginning to recover. This pattern suggests that if the cycle continues as it has historically, altcoins season could start in approximately 45 days.

“To see how far [altcoins] have to go between now and hitting the all-time, that means that altcoins need to go up by 50%. Do you understand how violent a move of 50% in the next 45 days is going to be? It’s face melting,” Neuner emphasized.

Meanwhile, Rekt Fencer highlighted that the low-cap coins and meme coins could benefit the most, albeit the higher risk. He said that achieving 2x to 10x gains is common, especially, in the early stages of altcoin season. 
The Cryptocurrencies to Watch
To navigate altcoin season, investors are advised to build a diversified crypto portfolio, stick to their investment narratives, and exercise patience. 

Rekt Fencer shared a list of six under-the-radar altcoins that may have significant potential. Leading the pack is Polyhedra Network (ZK), a project focused on Web3 interoperability, scalability, and privacy through zero-knowledge proof technology. With a market cap of $286.3 million and a current price of $3.14, Polyhedra presents an interesting entry point.
Not to be overlooked, the quirky meme coin Wolf Wif Ballz (BALLZ) continues to charm its way through the Solana ecosystem. With its blend of humor and investment potential, BALLZ, priced at $0.05 and boasting a $50.2 million market cap, exemplifies the unpredictable nature of meme coins.
Portal (PORTAL) emerges in the GameFi space, offering a cross-chain gaming ecosystem that bridges disparate blockchain networks. Coupled with staking rewards, PORTAL, at $2.07 and a $306.6 million market cap, is crafting a new narrative for gamers.

Meanwhile, Boson Protocol (BOSON) enables the tokenization, transfer, and trade of physical goods as NFTs. BOSON, priced at $0.68 with an $83.1 million market cap, aims to revolutionize the perception of value and ownership in the digital age.
Finally, the market of artificial intelligence in crypto is led by pioneers such as VoluMint (VMINT) and Monai (MONAI). These projects leverage AI to enhance trading activity and integrate LLMs with blockchain protocols, respectively.
In preparing for the upcoming altcoin season, investors should conduct thorough research, consider diversifying their portfolios, and remain cognizant of the risks associated with cryptocurrency investments. With the right strategy and a bit of patience, the next few months could be transformative for the savvy crypto investor.

Could PEPE Price Hit New Highs as Exchange Supply Drops?


PEPE supply on exchanges saw a significant drop in just one day, signaling that holders anticipate a rise in value, as an increasing Mean Coin Age suggests a lack of selling pressure and a phase of accumulation. 
Though EMA lines don’t show a strong bullish trend, they indicate potential consolidation, setting the stage for a possible price surge. Despite a 442.77% increase this year, PEPE price struggles to surpass and maintain above the $0.0000080 threshold.
PEPE Supply On Exchanges Triggered An Important Signal
Between March 25 and March 26, the PEPE supply on exchanges experienced a significant reduction, dropping from 180.7 trillion to 178.7 trillion. 
Such a sizable decrease in supply available for trading can have a substantial impact on PEPE’s price, primarily due to the principles of supply and demand. When the supply of PEPE on exchanges diminishes, but demand remains constant or increases, it naturally leads to upward pressure on the price.

Historically, a precedent for this scenario occurred when a similar reduction in supply was promptly followed by a notable price surge—from $0.000008 to $0.0000106 in just one day. 

This pattern suggests that the recent drop in exchange supply could be a precursor to another significant price increase for PEPE, as reduced availability on trading platforms may prompt a spike in buying interest and price.

PEPE Mean Coin Age Suggests Accumulation
Since the beginning of March, the Mean Coin Age for PEPE has been on a consistent upward trajectory. Mean Coin Age measures the average age of all coins in a network, calculated from the time they were last moved. 
This metric serves as an indicator of investor behavior. A growing Mean Coin Age suggests that holders are increasingly opting to hold onto their coins rather than sell them, indicating a period of accumulation. This trend is generally seen as a bullish signal for the cryptocurrency, as it implies a strong holding sentiment among investors and a potential decrease in selling pressure, which can lead to price increases.
PEPE Mean Coin Age. Source: Santiment.
The Mean Coin Age has shown stability in the last three days, hinting that PEPE may be entering a consolidation phase. Consolidation periods often precede significant market movements as they reflect a balance between supply and demand before a new trend emerges. 

This stabilization of Mean Coin Age, therefore, could be an early indicator that PEPE is gearing up for the next phase of price surges, as the market consolidates and prepares for future volatility.
PEPE Price Prediction: Can It Surpass Beyond $0.000011?
On March 14, PEPE reached its all-time peak, hitting a remarkable price of $0.0000106. Since reaching this pinnacle, it has encountered challenges in maintaining its value above the $0.0000080 mark, showing signs of struggle in the market.
Currently, three out of the four Exponential Moving Average (EMA) lines for PEPE are converging, aligning closely with the current price trajectory. This convergence, especially with short-term EMA lines positioned above the longer-term counterparts, sends a bullish signal to investors. This alignment suggests that the PEPE price might be stabilizing, potentially entering a phase of consolidation as market participants gauge their next moves.

Exponential Moving Averages (EMA) focus more on recent data, making them quicker to react than Simple Moving Averages (SMA). They give more weight to the latest prices, decreasing this weight for older data.
Read More: Pepe (PEPE) Price Prediction 2024/2025/2030
Rising supply on exchanges and Mean Coin Age for PEPE show holders want to keep their assets. They expect gains, setting PEPE up for potential price increases. If PEPE breaks the $0.0000085 level, it may reach $0.000011 for the first time. However, if it falls below $0.0000070 support, the price could dip to $0.0000049.

Coinbase Wallet triumph over SEC allegations is a ‘giant win’ for DeFi

Crypto lawyers are hailing a recent decision by a United States judge to dismiss allegations against Coinbase Wallet as a win for self-custody wallets and decentralized finance (DeFi) apps.U.S. District Judge Katherine Failla on March 27 denied Coinbase’s bid to dismiss a Securities and Exchange Commission’s lawsuit, finding the SEC “sufficiently pleaded” Coinbase was unlicensed and its crypto staking offering was unregistered securities.The judge also determined the SEC failed to allege that Coinbase conducted brokerage activity through Coinbase Wallet — its self-custody crypto wallet app giving users full control of their assets.“[This] is a pretty giant win for browser-based wallet extensions, application front ends, and other similar applications,” said Ethena Labs general counsel Zach Rosenberg in a March 27 X post.“[It’s] not just that Coinbase won, but the basis for it,” Rosenberg emphasized. He explained that Coinbase helping Wallet users find token prices doesn’t mean it’s acting as a broker by “routing or making recommendations.”


The court order could be used by DeFi app developers facing similar lawsuits to argue their way out of allegations they acted as an unregistered broker.Industry advocate body the Blockchain Association legal head Marisa Tashman Coppel posted she was “very pleased to see the court curb massive SEC overreach with regard to the Coinbase Wallet allegations.”Law firm Willkie Farr & Gallagher partner Mike Selig said in an X post the Coinbase Wallet dismissal was a “significant setback” for the SEC. “SEC aimed to discourage builders from developing peer-to-peer software. Didn’t work.”Crypto venture firm Variant legal chief Jake Chervinsky said, however, that while there are “some positives” in the judge’s order — “overall, SEC wins.”Related: US lawmakers demand SEC clarify position on Prometheum’s plans for Ether“It’s great for DeFi that Wallet is not a broker, and there’s good language on other issues,” he said. “But the court sided with the SEC (incorrectly, [in my opinion]) on several key issues.”Chervinsky explained Judge Failla said the Howey test — a legal framework to classify securities — applies to “purely secondary market transactions” and ignores the “‘contract’ in ‘investment contract.’”He claimed the court also adopted the SEC’s theory that a token project using sale profits to re-invest into its ecosystem is a “common enterprise” where buyers would reasonably expect profits — making it a security.“This is a disappointing outcome,” Chervinsky said. “But it’s only the beginning — not the end — of the SEC’s case against Coinbase specifically.”The case will now continue into discovery — where Coinbase and the SEC collect evidence for their arguments.The SEC first sued Coinbase in June last year, alleging it listed 13 tokens the regulator deemed securities and operated as an unlicenced exchange and broker-dealer, which Coinbase denies.X Hall of Flame: Coinbase ‘is going to win’ says MetaLawMan

Edward Snowden Predicts SEC Will 'Lose So Hard In Court' against Coinbase: Gensler Had To Approve Bitcoin ETFs 'With Tears In His Eyes' - Coinbase Glb (NASDAQ:COIN) - Benzinga

Whistleblower and Bitcoin BTC/USD supporter Edward Snowden isn’t bothered by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission’s latest legal wrangling with Coinbase Global Inc. COIN.What Happened: Snowden’s comment came in response to a tweet about a court ruling allowing the SEC to proceed with its lawsuit against Coinbase. The former National Security Agency contractor tweeted, “This doesn’t bother me. If the SEC keeps acting in bad faith like this, they’re going to lose so hard in court that they’ll never be able to do this to anyone ever again.”The post on X, formerly Twitter, also recalled a past incident where the SEC Chair Gary Gensler had to approve Bitcoin ETFs following a legal defeat.“Remember when the SEC got spanked so badly that Gensler had to approve BTC ETFs with tears in his eyes?”See Also: Here’s How Much $100 In Bitcoin Could Be Worth In 2030 If Cathie Wood’s New Price Target Is ReachedWhy It Matters: The SEC filed a lawsuit against Coinbase in June 2023, accusing the exchange of operating as an unregistered securities dealer. The court recently rejected Coinbase’s motion to dismiss the SEC’s allegations, marking a significant setback for the company. Snowden, a known supporter of Bitcoin, has previously called it the most significant monetary advancement since the invention of coinage. He has also predicted that a national government will be revealed this year to have been buying Bitcoin without disclosing the fact. Price Action: Coinbase shares ended the regular session 3.79% lower at $256.70. The shares were up nearly 0.9% in the after-hours trading.

                        Russian government bodies, the nation’s anti-money laundering agency, and the Central Bank have reportedly “come to a consensus” on crypto policy.The breakthrough could finally put an end to a long-standing crypto impasse in Moscow. It could also see Russia belatedly start regulating the crypto sector.Russian Government’s Crypto ‘Breakthrough’
According to the media outlet RBC, the Ministry of Finance, the Central Bank, and Rosfinmonitoring have “agreed on an approach to regulating cryptocurrencies.”Rosfinmonitoring is the country’s anti-money laundering and counter-terrorism financing agency. It has recently called for Moscow to fast-track crypto regulations after the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) downgraded Russia’s compliance rating.The FATF noted that Russia had adopted “insufficient regulation of virtual assets and cryptocurrencies” at a February 23 plenary meeting.The Ministry of Finance and the Central Bank have been at loggerheads over crypto policy for years.The ministry wants to regulate crypto and legalize industrial mining. It also wants to let Russian firms use crypto as an international payment tool.Miners this month petitioned ministries in a third concerted effort to have their industry placed on an official register of licensed business activities.Ministries have responded “positively,” Russian reports have claimed. However, the Russian government is not united on the matter.The nation’s trade and industry ministry is reportedly unhappy with the proposal.However, the acting director of the Financial Policy Department of the Ministry of Finance, Alexey Yakovlev, said “both the state and market participants” were interested in legalizing the industry.Miners have claimed Moscow can expect to raise millions of dollars worth of tax every year from their booming industry.They have also claimed that if Moscow nurtures their industry, Russia will be able to displace the United States as the world’s biggest crypto mining power.Anton Siluanov (left), Russia’s Minister of Finance. (Source: Studio Production/YouTube)Third Time Lucky for Russian Crypto Miners?
The Ministry of Finance has reportedly begun drafting a bill that will deal with matters related to crypto mining.The same ministry’s last attempt to create a crypto bill resulted in abject failure in 2022, when the Central Bank countered with its own rival bill.The crypto-skeptic Central Bank’s 2022 bill proposed a China-style ban on almost all forms of crypto-related activities.Crypto Consensus Forming in Moscow?
However, Yakovlev offered hope. He said that both the bank and Rosfinmonitoring were “consulting” with the ministry on the draft bill.Yakovlev said the bill would address matters including how miners must handle coins. The bank has previously said it will only countenance crypto mining if miners swap their coins for fiat on overseas crypto trading platforms.Law enforcement agencies have expressed their destain for this plan, saying that it will “open the door to money laundering.”RBC also quoted a Ministry of Finance spokesperson as “expressing the hope” that the State Duma would “be able to consider a bill on the regulation of cryptocurrencies” in the current session.Yakovlev has previously said it “would be pointless” for the Russian government to “attempt to ban crypto mining.”In March 2022, he poured cold water on ministry proposals to ban “private” mining – and “legalize” industrial the mining sector.

$9.5 Billion In Bitcoin Options Poised To Expire This Friday: Market Turbulence Ahead?


                            This Friday, the spotlight is turned to Deribit, the leading crypto derivatives exchange, as it gears up for a notable event in its trading history. Particularly, the exchange is poised to witness the expiration of over $9.5 billion in Bitcoin options open interest.
For context, Open interest refers to the total number of outstanding derivative contracts, such as futures or options, that have not been settled or closed. It represents the number of contracts market participants hold at the end of each trading day. 
This surge in open interest recorded by Deribit reflects increased market participation and signals heightened liquidity, marking a notable milestone in the crypto derivatives landscape.

Record-Breaking Open Interest
Notably, this event is significant in two ways: It underscores the growing interest in Bitcoin as an asset class and highlights the increasing “sophistication” of the cryptocurrency market. This is because Open interest can also serve as a critical indicator of market health and trader sentiment. 
As such, the record levels of open interest set to expire on Deribit suggest a “vibrant” trading environment, with more investors engaging in complex financial instruments like options.
According to Deribit data, the exchange is set to host one of its largest option expiries ever, with $9.5 billion worth of Bitcoin options poised for expiry at the end of the month. This figure represents a substantial portion, approximately 40%, of the exchange’s total options open interest, which stands at $26.3 billion.

The magnitude of this expiry event eclipses previous months, with January and February end-of-month expiries totaling $3.74 billion and $3.72 billion, respectively. This trend indicates a large increase in market activity and investor engagement on the platform.
Implications Of The Bitcoin Expiry
The upcoming expiry has notable implications for the market, especially considering the current pricing dynamics of Bitcoin. 
With Bitcoin’s spot price hovering below $70,000, an estimated $3.9 billion of the open interest is expected to expire “in the money,” according to Deribit analysts, presenting profitable opportunities for holders of these options contracts. 
The “max pain” price, which represents the strike price at which the highest number of options would expire worthless, thereby causing the maximum financial loss to option holders, is identified at $50,000.

According to the analysts, this scenario suggests that a significant number of traders are positioned to benefit from the current market conditions, potentially leading to “increased buying activity” as these options are exercised.
Additionally, Deribit analysts speculate that the high level of “in-the-money expiries” could exert upward pressure on Bitcoin’s price or amplify market volatility. They added that as traders “hedge their positions” or “speculate on future price movements,” the market may witness a flurry of activity, impacting Bitcoin’s price trajectory in the short term.

This comes at a time when Bitcoin has experienced a slight retracement from its recent all-time high above $73,000, with the price adjusting to approximately $68,946, at the time of writing

Cardano [ADA] starts bull run as XRP lags behind - What's going on? - AMBCrypto



Stagnant ADA tokens decreased, which is a bullish sign for the long term.
XRP remained rangebound even as the MDIA fell.

Bitcoin [BTC] was trading at $70.2k at press time, under 5% beneath its all-time high of $73.7k, as ETF inflows had another strong day.
A Santiment post on X (formerly Twitter) noted that previously dormant wallets were getting active and bringing older BTC into circulation.
This behavior is one of the “primary ingredients” for a bull run, Santiment’s tweet said. AMBCrypto used this metric to analyze Cardano [ADA] and Ripple [XRP] to understand whether their bull run has begun too.
Cardano is off the marks
The Mean Dollar Invested Age (MDIA) is the metric that both Santiment and AMBCrypto referred to earlier. It is slightly different from the mean coin age metric.
The difference is that the mean dollar invested age accounts for the purchase price of the dormant BTC (or any other asset).
An uptrend in an asset’s MDIA is considered normal and reflects the coins getting increasingly dormant over time. Holders prefer to hold, which is generally a good thing.
However, when this happens for months at a time or longer, there is some stagnancy in the network. This is concerning because it would make it harder for prices to continue to rise.
When the MDIA falls, it shows previously dormant coins waking up. In the long term, as prices trend higher, investors want to see the MDIA metric trend lower.

The Cardano MDIA (5 years) has been on an uptrend since July 2021. In early March, the metric fell lower as if off a cliff. This was good news for long-term investors.
Less stagnant ADA is generally associated with the beginning of a strong bull run that could last many months.
The last time the MDIA of Cardano maintained a steady downtrend was in July 2020. ADA prices surged from $0.09 to $3.1 before correcting.
During the price’s uptrend, the weekly RSI also formed a series of lower highs. This is technically a bearish divergence, but is not a signal to use for trading during the price discovery phase.
As things stand, this set of lower highs was not present on the weekly RSI.
While XRP investors fret

XRP also saw a downtrend in its MDIA metric from September 2020 to April 2021. This began to reverse and prices trended lower.
This trend strengthened the deeper it got into the bear market, signaling accumulation as prices slid.
Like ADA, XRP also saw a sharp fall in the MDIA. However, this occurred in early December 2023, and the metric has trended higher since.
The precipitous drop not followed by an uptrend could be from profit-taking activity or vast selling pressure from whales.

The MDIA alone is not enough to glean information on exactly where XRP is in the current cycle. Its uptrend since January hinted strongly that an accumulation phase was underway.
XRP remained within a range and was unable to break the $0.7 key resistance level. The uptick in MDIA could be followed by a true bull run in the coming months.

Gaming Platform Exploit Ends With $62M In Crypto Returned


								In the late hours of Tuesday, the crypto community saw another exploit. Munchables, the Ethereum Layer-2 NFT gaming platform, reported being compromised on an X post.
The crypto heist, which momentarily stole over $62 million, took a shocking turn of events after the attacker’s identity opened a Pandora’s box.

Crypto Developer Turns Hacker
Yesterday, Munchables, a gaming platform powered by Blast, suffered a security breach that resulted in the theft of 17,400 ETH, worth around $62.5 million. Immediately after the X announcement, crypto detective ZachXBT revealed the sum stolen and the address where the funds had been sent.
It was later informed that the crypto heist had been an inside job instead of an external one, as one of the project’s developers seemed to be responsible.
Solidity developer 0xQuit shared on X concerning information about Munchable. The developer pointed out that the smart contract was a “dangerously upgradeable proxy with an unverified implementation contract.”


The exploit seemingly wasn’t “nothing complex” as it consisted of asking the contract for the stolen funds. However, it required the attacker to be an authorized party, confirming that the heist was a scheme carried out inside the project.
After a deep dive into the matter, 0xQuit concluded that the attack had been plotted since deployment. Munchable’s developer used the contract’s upgradable nature to “assign himself an enormous ether balance before changing the contract implementation to one that appeared legit.”
The developer “simply withdrew the balance” when the total value locked (TVL) was high enough. DeFiLlama data shows that, before the exploit, Munchables had a TLV of $96.16 million. At writing time, the TVL has plummeted to $34.05 million.
As reported by BlockSec, the funds were sent to a multi-sig wallet. The attacker eventually shared all private keys with the Munchables team. The keys gave access to $62.5 million in ETH, 73 WETH, and the owner key, which contained the rest of the project’s funds. According to Solidity developer’s calculations, the total amount neared $100 million.


Change Of Heart Or Fear Of The Crypto Community?
Unfortunately, crypto exploits, hacks, and scams are common in the industry. Most play out similarly, with hackers taking massive sums and investors looking at their empty pockets.
This time, the incident turned out more thrilling than usual, as the identity of the developer-turned-hacker untangled a web of lies and deception. As ZachXBT suggested, Munchable’s rogue developer was North Korean, seemingly tied to the Lazarus group.
However, the movie doesn’t end there: the blockchain investigator revealed that four different developers hired by Munchables’ team were linked to the exploiter, and it seemed like they were all the same person.


These developers recommended each other for the job and regularly transferred payments to the same two exchange deposit addresses, funding each other wallets. Journalist Laura Shin suggested the possibility of the developers not being the same person but different people working for the same entity, North Korea’s government.
Pixelcraft Studios CEO added that he had done a trial hire with this developer in 2022. During the month the ex-Munchables developer worked for them, he exhibited practices “sketchy af.”
The CEO believes that the North Korean link is possible. Additionally, he revealed that the MO was similar back then, as the developer tried to get “his friend” hired.
An X user highlighted that the developer’s GitHub name was “grudev325,” pointing out that “gru” could be related to Russia’s Federal Agency for Foreign Military Intelligence.
Pixelcrafts’s CEO commented that, at the time, the developer explained that the nickname was born after his love for the character Gru from the Despicable Me movies. Ironically, the character in question is a supervillain who spends most of the movie trying to steal the moon.



Whether he was trying to steal the moon and failed like Gru, the developer ultimately returned the funds without asking for “compensation.” Many users believe that the suspicious “change of heart” results from ZackXBT’s deep dive into the attacker’s web of lies and the threats made.
This thriller ends with the crypto investigator’s reply to a now-deleted post. In his reply, the detective threatened to destroy the developer and all his “other North Korean devs hard on-chain your country has another blackout.”

BlackRock's BUIDL Ethereum Fund Draws $245 Million In a Week - Decrypt

The Ethereum-based BUIDL fund from investing giant BlackRock has raised $245 million in Ethereum tokens since its launch last week. According to data from Etherscan, ten transactions have entered the BlackRock USD Institutional Digital Liquidity Fund, beginning with $5 million on March 20 when the BUIDL fund launched.Over the next seven days, an additional $239.8 million flowed into the ERC-20-based fund, including $92 million in Ondo Short-Term US Government Treasuries from the tokenized real-world asset platform Ordo Finance.“We’re excited to see BlackRock embracing securities tokenization with the launch of BUIDL, especially its broad cooperation with ecosystem participants,” Ordo Finance said in a blog post on Wednesday. “Not only does this further validate our original concept of a tokenized US Treasury fund, but it also bolsters our thesis that tokenization of traditional securities on public blockchains represents the next major step in the evolution of financial markets.”While not a stablecoin like USDT or USDC, BlackRock says the value of BUIDL is intended to remain 1 to 1 with the U.S. dollar, where 1 BUIDL equals $1. Cryptocurrency stablecoins aim to provide some stability in the often volatile cryptocurrency market and provide a pathway to exchanges for fiat or other tokens.BlackRock said the fund invests 100% of its assets in cash, U.S. Treasury bills, and repurchase agreements.BlackRock filed documents for the British Virgin Island-based BlackRock USD Institutional Digital Liquidity Fund with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission on March 14. News of the application renewed hope that a spot Ethereum ETF could be on the horizon despite the SEC's pushback on BlackRock’s iShares Ethereum Trust ETF.Last week, the SEC also delayed a decision on Grayscale’s Ethereum ETF until the end of May.According to data from the Real-World Assets (RWA) platform, BlackRock’s BUIDL ranks second after Franklin Templeton’s Franklin OnChain U.S. Government Money Fund, which has a market capitalization of $360.2 million. The Ethereum-based BlackRock BUIDL fund has a market capitalization of 106.5 million.Speaking to CNBC in January, BlackRock CEO Larry Fink laid out the case of crypto-based exchange-traded funds after the SEC approved the first Bitcoin ETFs.“I see value in having an Ethereum ETF,” Fink said at the time. “As I said, these are just stepping stones towards tokenization.”While there is strong interest in an Ethereum spot ETF, such an investment vehicle is unlikely to draw anywhere near as much interest as those now available for Bitcoin, which attracted $4.5 billion in their first day of availability.Edited by Ryan Ozawa.Stay on top of crypto news, get daily updates in your inbox.

Ondo Finance Joins BlackRock Tokenized Fund As Inflows Surpass $160M


                            BlackRock, one of the largest asset managers globally, has witnessed notable success with its newly launched tokenized money-market fund, BUIDL. The fund, which records shared ownership on the Ethereum (ETH) blockchain, has attracted over $160 million in just one week since its debut. 
BlackRock’s BUIDL Fund
According to a Bloomberg report, the BlackRock USD Institutional Digital Liquidity Fund (BUIDL) primarily invests in cash, US Treasury bills, and repurchase agreements. The fund rewards its holders with a cryptocurrency, BUIDL, valued at $1 per token. 
Shareholders can transfer these tokens to other validated addresses using digital wallets approved by Securitize, BlackRock’s partner for the investment vehicle. The tokenized fund serves several key use cases, including treasury management for crypto companies, support for derivatives of Treasury bills, and acting as collateral for borrowing and trading, thus providing an alternative to stablecoins.

It is worth noting that Securitize Markets, an SEC-registered alternative trading system, plays a critical role in facilitating the transfer of tokens between market participants. 
While the SEC has recently increased its scrutiny of Ethereum’s native token, ETH, Securitize CEO Carlos Domingo emphasizes that the investigations should be separate from the underlying blockchain infrastructure. Domingo also highlights the battle-tested nature of the public Ethereum blockchain, which provides a “robust foundation” for tokenization activities.
As previously reported by our sister website, Bitcoinist, BlackRock has emerged as an advocate for cryptocurrencies and tokenization within mainstream financial institutions. Chairman and CEO Larry Fink believes every financial asset will eventually be tokenized. 
The company’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) has already attracted more than $13 billion in inflows since its launch as an exchange-traded fund (ETF) in January. With the BUIDL fund’s launch, BlackRock continues to demonstrate its willingness to explore new digital asset solutions.
Ondo Finance To Transfer $95 Million In Assets To BlackRock
Ondo Finance, a platform specializing in tokenized real-world assets (RWA), has moved $95 million worth of assets to BlackRock’s BUIDL fund. This strategic move enables Ondo Finance to facilitate instant settlements for its US Treasury-backed token, OUSG. 
This makes Ondo Finance a major participant in the BUIDL ecosystem. According to on-chain researcher Tom Wan, it currently holds $15 million worth of BUIDL tokens, which, in addition to those above $95 million, will result in a substantial $110 million worth of BUIDL tokens.  

The researcher noted that this collaboration further strengthens the tokenized US Treasury market, with the potential to reach $1 billion in value. In its announcement, the team behind the Ondo Finance platform summarized:
We’re excited to see BlackRock embracing securities tokenization with the launch of BUIDL, especially its broad cooperation with ecosystem participants. Not only does this further validate our original concept of a tokenized US Treasury fund, but it also bolsters our thesis that tokenization of traditional securities on public blockchains represents the next major step in the evolution of financial markets.

At the time of writing, the native token of Ondo Finance, ONDO, is trading at $0.909, exhibiting a surge of over 4% within the past 24 hours. This positive momentum adds to its impressive price uptrend of 115% recorded over the past 30 days.

BlackRock CEO ’very bullish’ on Bitcoin as its ETF crosses $17B

BlackRock CEO Larry Fink has been “pleasantly surprised” by the performance of his firm’s spot Bitcoin (BTC) exchange-traded fund (ETF) and has reiterated he's “very bullish” on the long-term viability of Bitcoin. “IBIT is the fastest growing ETF in the history of ETFs. Nothing has gained assets as fast as IBIT in the history of ETFs,” Larry Fink said in a March 27 interview with Fox Business.Fink said the iShares Bitcoin Trust’s (IBIT) performance has even “surprised” him at how well it has performed over the first 11 trading weeks.IBIT has a strong start to trading, tallying $13.5 billion in flows in the first 11 weeks, with an $849 million daily high on March 12, according to Farside Investors. IBIT averages a little over $260 million in inflows per trading day.“We’re creating now a market that has more liquidity, more transparency and I'm pleasantly surprised. I would never have predicted it before we filed it that we were going to see this type of retail demand,” Fink said.Asked whether IBIT would “do good, but not this good,” Fink responded: “Yes, definitely.”“I’m very bullish on the long-term viability of Bitcoin,” the BlackRock CEO added.


IBIT currently holds $17.1 billion in Bitcoin, according to BitMEX Research, and took only two months to reach the $10 billion mark — a milestone that took the first gold ETF two years to reach.Of all the currently approved ETFs, IBIT only trails the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust in Bitcoin holdings — at $23.6 billion in BTC. Grayscale's Bitcoin holdings have continued to slip, however, down from 620,000 BTC it held before converting to a spot Bitcoin ETF.Source: BitMEX ResearchThe nine-spot Bitcoin ETF issuers (excluding Grayscale) now hold over $34.1 billion in Bitcoin, with IBIT, the Fidelity Wise Origin Bitcoin Fund (FBTC) and ARK 21Shares Bitcoin ETF (ARKB) leading inflows. Related: Bitcoin currently in ‘middle of the bull run’ — Grayscale reportMeanwhile, some industry pundits predict that some spot Bitcoin ETF issuers could eventually shut down due to a lack of profits.“Most of the current ETFs launched will never even break even as costs will only work if they get to billions of assets under management, which they won’t,” Hector McNeil, the co-CEO and founder of white-label ETF provider HANetf, recently told Cointelegraph.Several ETF issuers have lowered fees to try to be competitive against some of the bigger players. But these smaller issuers “face an uphill battle in entering this turf war of giants,” according to Bloomberg ETF analyst Henry Jim.“If they match fees, they won’t have enough revenue to survive, and if they don’t lower fees, they won’t be able to gather enough critical mass assets to survive.”Asset management firm Hashdex had its spot Bitcoin ETF approved on March 27, making it the 11th and latest entrant to a competitive spot Bitcoin ETF market in the United States.Magazine: Wolf Of All Streets worries about a world where Bitcoin hits $1M: Hall of Flame

Anthropic's Claude AI Overthrows ChatGPT on Chatbot Arena Leaderboard - Decrypt

While ChatGPT from Open AI enjoys the largest mainstream mindshare of all generative AI tools, its top spot has been stolen by the top-of-the-line Claude 3 Opus from perennial contender Anthropic on a popular crowdsourced leaderboard used by AI researchers.Claude’s ascension in the Chatbot Arena rankings marks the first time that OpenAI's GPT-4, which powers ChatGPT Plus, has been dethroned since it first appeared on the leaderboard in May of last year.Chatbot Arena is run by Large Model Systems Organization (LMSYS ORG), a research organization dedicated to open models that support collaboration between students and faculty at the University of California, Berkeley, UC San Diego, and Carnegie Mellon University. The platform presents users with two unlabeled language models and asks them to rate which one performs better based on any criteria they deem fit.After aggregating thousands of subjective comparisons, Chatbot Arena calculates the "best" models for the leaderboard, updating it over time.That subjective approach, based on participants' disparate personal tastes, is what sets Chatbot Arena apart from other AI benchmarks. Model trainers cannot "cheat" by tailoring their models to beat the algorithm, as they might with quantitative benchmarks. By measuring what people simply prefer, Chatbot Arena is a valuable, qualitative resource for AI researchers.The platform collects users’ feedback and runs it through the Bradley-Terry statistical model to predict the likelihood of a particular model outperforming others in direct competition. This approach enables the generation of comprehensive statistics, including confidence interval ranges for Elo rating estimates—the same technique used to measure the skill of chess players.The top 10 LLMs ranked by the Chatbot Arena. Image: HuggingfaceClaude 3 Opus's rise to the top is not the only significant development on the leaderboard. Claude 3 Sonnet (the medium size model available for free) and Claude 3 Haiku (a smaller, faster model), also developed by Anthropic, are currently in 4th and 6th place, respectively.The leaderboard includes different versions of GPT-4, such as GPT-4-0314 (the "original" version of GPT-4 from March 2023), GPT-4-0613, GPT-4-1106-preview, and GPT-4-0125-preview (the latest GPT-4 Turbo model available via API from January 2024). According to the ranking, Sonnet and Haiku are both better than the original GPT-4 with Sonnet also outpacing a tweaked version launched by OpenAI on June 2023.This also means that, sadly, there is only one open-source LLM currently in the top 10: Qwen, with Starling 7b and Mixtral 8x7B the only other open models in the top 20.One of the advantages of Claude over GPT-4 is its token context capacity and retrieval capability. The public version of Claude 3 Opus handles over 200K—and the organization claims to have a restricted version capable of handling 1 million tokens with almost perfect retrieval rates. This means that Claude can understand longer prompts and retain information more effectively than compared to GPT-4 Turbo, which handles 128K tokens and loses its retrieval capabilities with long prompts.Recall accuracy of Claude 3 Opus vs GPT-4 Turbo. Image from Decrypt using data from Anthropic and Greg Kamradt.Google's Gemini Advanced has also been gaining traction in the AI assistant space. The company offers a plan that includes 2TB of storage and AI capabilities in the suite of Google products for the same price as a Chat GPT Plus subscription ($20 per month).The free Gemini Pro is currently ranked number 4, between GPT-4 Turbo and Claude 3 Sonnet. The top-of-the-line Gemini Ultra model is unavailable for testing and is not yet featured in the rankings.Edited by Ryan Ozawa.Stay on top of crypto news, get daily updates in your inbox.

What is ASI? SingularityNet, FetchAI, and Ocean's $7.6B Merger - DailyCoin


        
SingularityNet, FetchAI, and Ocean have joined an alliance. 



The ASI alliance looks to take on Big Tech and its dominion over the AI industry. 



The $7.5 billion alliance aims to accelerate the race to a more open and democratized AI industry. 
Artificial Intelligence (AI) has been making waves in recent headlines, proving it is more than just another buzzword. The growing hype surrounding the technology has spurred a race among firms, especially Big Tech, as they vie for control over the sector.In this fast-paced competition, several blockchain companies have also joined the fray, aiming to ride the AI wave and democratize access to this transformative technology. However, despite these valiant efforts, Big Tech’s dominance remains, overshadowing the handful of blockchain AI projects. Enter the Artificial Superintelligence Alliance, a multi-billion dollar merger involving SingularityNet, Fetch.AI, and Ocean Protocol, poised to directly challenge the monopolistic control over AI.What is the ASI Alliance?The Artificial Superintelligence Alliance is a merger of the leading AI blockchain protocols in the industry. It includes SingularityNet, a blockchain-based AI marketplace; Fetch.AI, a decentralized multi-agent AI platform; and Ocean Protocol, a data exchange firm.Pending approval from their respective communities, this alliance is poised to establish the world’s largest open-sourced decentralized network via the ASI token, which will accelerate the collaborators’ race to Artificial General Intelligence (AGI).How will SingularityNet, FetchAI, and Ocean Merge Their Token?As part of the formation of the Alliance, Fetch.AI’s FET token, Ocean Protocol’s OCEAN token, and SingularityNet’s AGIX token will converge into a single ASI token that will operate across a combined decentralized AI network, providing unprecedented scale and power.



Upon receiving majority approval from their respective communities, the following conversions will take place:
FET becomes ASI with a total supply of 2.63055 billion tokens and a starting price of $2.82



AGIX tokens migrate to ASI at a conversion rate of 0.433350:1



OCEAN tokens migrate to ASI at a conversion rate of 0.433226:1



ASI will have a total FDV of $7.6 billion.
Who Will Lead the ASI Alliance? In an official release shared with DailyCoin, SingularityNet confirmed that the ASI alliance will be led by led by Ben Goertzel, CEO and Founder of SingularityNet; Humayun Sheikh, co-founder of Fetch.AI; Bruce Pon, CEO and Co-Founder of Ocean Protocol; and Trent McConaghy, Co-Founder of Ocean Protocol.According to the release, the underlying entities, SingularityNet, FetchAI, and Ocean Protocol, will continue to operate as separate entities but will collaborate closely in the shared $ASI tokenomic ecosystem and in the operation of the Alliance.How will the ASI Alliance Impact the AI Industry?The ASI Alliance looks to capitalize on the success of the AI industry, including the growth of the underlying organizations as a countermeasure against Big Tech’s expanding control over AI development, use, and monetization. 



The alliance aims to create a decentralized, open AI infrastructure that will promote open networks for coordinating machine intelligence toward shared objectives, unlike BigTech’s promotion of closed-source solutions such as ChatGpt. Bruce Pon, Ocean Protocol CEO & Co-Founder, believes the combination can deliver on the promise of a vertically integrated stack of decentralized technologies with scale to compete globally. “The combination of our technologies creates a leader in R&D, applications, and commercialization of AGI,” Pon notes. “The unified ASI token is the glue to orchestrate all actors with common incentives. ASI tokens are used to secure the public network, as data access tokens and to unlock computation without needing traditional banking and payment rails. It is the native currency for the machine economy.”On the Flipside
OCEAN witnessed the biggest surge among the three tokens, gaining as much as 36% over the past 24 hours to trade at $1.49 as of press time following news of the merger. 



Tether Operations Limited also recently introduced its entry into AI.
Why This MattersThe Artificial Superintelligence Alliance marks a significant achievement for both the crypto and AI industry, posing a direct challenge to the expanding dominance of Big Tech over AI. Read more about the ASI token: SingularityNet Confirms Groundbreaking AI Merger to ASI TokenFTX claimants beware of this ongoing scam:FTX, BlockFi Claimants Scammed for Millions via Fake Emails

Seasoned Analyst Reveals Ethereum Spot ETF Approval Prediction for May: "Unlikely This Year" - Bitcoin Sistemi

Cryptocurrency market maker GSR revised its forecast for the approval of a spot Ethereum ETF in May, reducing the probability to just 20%. That's a significant drop from the firm's estimate in January, which put the chance at 75%.
“We now believe there is a 20% chance that the SEC will approve a spot Ethereum ETF in May,” GSR analyst Brian Rudick explained the revised forecast in a note published today. According to GSR Research Analyst Matt Kunke, the previous optimistic outlook was attributed to Grayscale's Court of Appeals victory and the approval of Ethereum Futures ETFs in October.


Rudick noted that the conditions leading to the potential approval of the spot Ethereum ETF are similar to those leading up to the approval of spot Bitcoin ETFs. These included the existence of a futures-based ETF and a significant correlation between the spot and futures markets.

However, Rudick has now taken a more conservative view on the potential for spot ETH ETF approvals. He cited minimal interest from the SEC, political pressure against approving additional digital asset ETFs, and an alleged SEC investigation into whether ETH is a security as factors reducing the likelihood of approval.





Rudick now predicts that the approval process for spot Ethereum ETFs could take much longer than previously anticipated. “Our best guess is that the process will take much longer and will likely involve litigation, and we now believe spot Ethereum ETFs will likely be approved in 2025-2026,” he added.
Rudick also noted that, surprisingly, several applicant companies have recently amended their ETF applications to include ETH staking. While an ETF with staking returns is likely more attractive than one without one, Rudick questioned why companies would complicate the approval process, which already appears weak.


Rudick speculated that this could be an attempt by companies to get a response from an unresponsive SEC, or perhaps an admission of defeat in May and lay the groundwork for a future staking feature. “Both of these reasons, if true, point to lower approval ratings for May,” he said.

Ripple (XRP) Price Analysis: Bearish Signals Point to Major Drop


Ripple (XRP) price has been in a downtrend for the better half of the month, and these bearish signals are getting stronger.
Will the altcoin end up losing crucial support since XRP long-term holders are losing conviction in the asset?
Ripple Investors Lose Conviction
The long-term holders are one of the most important cohorts that impact the XRP price. These investors tend to hold an asset for a period of more than 12 months. Thus, selling from them is considered to be a confirmed bearish signal.
Their actions are observed by the total age consumed when they move their holdings between addresses. The higher the spike, the larger the amount of tokens moved. In the case of Ripple, their movement has not been as significant as instances in the past. Nevertheless, this is a signal that these investors are losing conviction.

Historically, during such occurrences, the XRP price has witnessed corrections most of the time. The same outcome can be expected this time around as well.
Read More: Ripple (XRP) Price Prediction 2024/2025/2030
A bearish move would be confirmed once the Relative Strength Index (RSI) falls below the neutral line at 50.0. RSI is a momentum oscillator measuring the speed and change of price movements, indicating overbought and oversold conditions.

Thus, the chances of a decline would increase if the indicators fall into the bearish zone.
XRP Price Prediction: Crucial Support Lost
XRP price is presently trading above the $0.606 support level. The altcoin has already slipped below the 50-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA). If the $0.606 support is invalidated, too, the cryptocurrency will lose the 100-day EMA as support.
This will result in further decline, potentially sending Ripple to $0.555.

However, per the Average Directional Index (ADX), the bearish trend has yet to gain strength. The latter is still below the 25.0 threshold crossing, which generally suggests that the active trend is gaining strength.

So, if the XRP price sees no immediate bearishness and manages to bounce back from $0.606, it might have a shot at recovery, potentially invalidating the bearish thesis.

The cryptocurrency market has been recovering significantly with strong bullish momentum. While Bitcoin has been a notable performer, investors have focused on altcoins for high returns. The global crypto market capitalization has exceeded $2.2 Trillion after falling down to a low of $2.2 Trillion in March 2024. During the bullish phase, investors are looking for projects that offer high growth potential.

So, the SEC just got a win against Coinbase - What do we do now? | Cryptopolitan

Hey! Wake up and smell the legal documents because the SEC just scored a victory against Coinbase, and it is a big blow for all of us. Yes. Sad day indeed. This landmark decision might just shake the very foundations of how crypto platforms operate in the United States. Unpacking the Legal DocumentSo here’s what went down. The court threw out Coinbase’s attempt to sidestep allegations by the SEC, effectively highlighting the platform’s operations as an exchange, a broker, and a clearing agency. All these titles come with heavy regulatory expectations under the US’s federal securities laws, and guess what? Coinbase has been doing its thing without the actual official thumbs-up from the SEC. Not to mention, their Staking Program’s caught up in this mess too, accused of offering and selling securities without registration.But then! The court did give Coinbase a pat on the back, dismissing the SEC’s complaints about the platform’s ‘Wallet.’ So, I guess that’s some good news.Now, moving on. The SEC’s beef with Coinbase revolves around the platform allowing trades of crypto assets that are, for all intents and purposes, being sold as investment contracts, a.k.a. securities. This includes a band of 13 crypto heavyweights like SOL, ADA, ICP, NEAR, MATIC, FLOW and a few others, making up the CryptoAssets list. Except for NEXO, which hangs out in Wallet territory, all these digital tokens are up for grabs for anyone who decides to jump on the Coinbase wagon. That sucks, no?But the SEC didn’t stop there. Oh no, they’ve laid out an entire buffet of claims against Coinbase, and pointed fingers at CGI, Coinbase’s parent, holding it responsible for not reigning in on these alleged securities law violations. And for the cherry on top, Coinbase’s Staking Program is under fire for supposedly offering and selling securities without the necessary legal hoopla.The Court’s Take and What It Means for UsThe SEC’s whole argument is leaning on established definitions of what constitutes an exchange, a broker, and a clearing agency. And when it comes to the big question – are these crypto assets securities? – the court looked at things through a lens that’s been polished by decades of U.S. securities law and said, “Uh, yes.”Coinbase did try its luck with arguments about the major questions doctrine and other legal defenses, but man, the court wasn’t buying it. So yeah I guess, the cryptocurrency industry doesn’t quite tip the scales compared to other industries that have triggered the major questions doctrine in the past.Moreover, the court said that the SEC’s filing this action was not an overreach of its authority in the least. If anything, it’s operating within the bounds set by Congress, tackling new challenges posed by new technologies like crypto. Meanwhile, Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong and Chief Legal Officer Paul Grewal were quick to drop their speeches on social media concerning the ruling. My boys are keeping it cool. Grewal said they have actually been preparing for this. His words were, “Early motions like ours against a government agency are almost always denied. But clarity is the ultimate goal and today’s decision continues us on that path.”He added that he is looking forward to the final judgment where they’ll prove they’re right. He also thanked the Court for its understanding of the Wallet’s technology. As for Brian, he quoted Paul’s tweet with a simple, “Great progress on the SEC case – and huge win for self-custodial wallets. This ensures the onchain ecosystem will continue to innovate and create economic freedom around the world.”So, where does this leave us? I don’t even know, you guys.

Can FET, AGIX, and OCEAN's merger spark another AI season? - AMBCrypto



The prices of the tokens surged one hour after the report became public knowledge.
Bringing  ASI to life might trigger a surge in the AI tokens’ market cap.

If the proposal laid down by the Fetch.ai [FET], SingularityNET [AGIX], and Ocean Protocol [OCEAN] teams is successful, all three AI-themed tokens might become one.
According to a Bloomberg report, the projects were nearing the finishing touches as they aim to create a decentralized platform. From the ongoing discussion, the ticker for the cryptocurrency would be “ASI” and it would have a diluted market cap of $7.5 billion.
ASI stands for Superintelligence Alliance. Since the beginning of this cycle, cryptocurrencies with Artificial Intelligence fundamentals have performed well.
Collaboration over competition
At press time, AMBCrypto observed that the impressive performances have driven the market cap of the category to $43.12 billion.
An hour after the development became public, the price of FET jumped by 3.78%. AGIX rose by 2.79%  while  OCEAN’s value climbed by 5.81%.
The price action of these tokens displayed increasing optimism about the outcome of the proposal. Furthermore, on-chain data showed the sentiment around these cryptocurrencies was starting to change.
Before the proposal came out, many AI tokens lost the goodwill they had earlier in the market. This was evident in the previous Weighted Sentiment reading.
At press time, the individual Weighted Sentiment readings of FET, AGIX, and OCEAN have improved. Though the sentiment around AGIX and FET remained negative, OCEAN rose much higher.
Source: Santiment
The rise in sentiment implied that participants were no more bearish on the projects. Going forward, there could be a case of  “buy the rumor.”
Buying the rumor here means that demand for the tokens might increase. This is because traders might accumulate the tokens in anticipation of a positive declaration. If the projects agree to the proposal, the market might experience a significant shift.
Done deal by April?
This potential shift could drive a rally that could see many AI tokens hit new highs. However, if the deal falls through, the prices might jump later. But a significant correction might appear before that.
In addition, AMBCrypto looked at the number of holders of each of these projects. As of this writing, the total amount of FET holders was 71,700. OCEAN had a lower number at 67,100 while AGIX was higher at 101,000 holders.
Source: Santiment
Should the proposal become a reality, the total number of “ASI” holders might be much more than these figures.
Until the projects conclude, they would continue as separate bodies. However, details from the report showed that the ranks might change if they reach an agreement.
Interestingly, a new development came in at the time of this writing. According to Fetch.ai’s official blog, FET, AGIX, and OCEAN executive teams have agreed to become one.

Realistic to not, here’s AGIX’s market cap in FET terms

However, Fetch noted that the integration would be subject to voting. The announcement read,
“A governance proposal will also be available to FET token stakers on the http://Fetch.ai network, and the other communities will vote on their side regarding this merger.”

                        Bitcoin halving stands as a significant event within the cryptocurrency sphere, signaling a shift for miners, institutions, and the overall market.This scheduled occurrence, happening roughly every four years, is expected to take place this April and would directly impact Bitcoin’s supply by reducing the mining reward by half, a core aspect designed to preserve its value over time.In a conversation with Cryptonews.com, William Quigley, a venture capitalist who co-founded the stablecoin issuer Tether and the NFT platform WAX.io, delved into the broader effects of Bitcoin halving.Quigley elaborated on the intricacies of Bitcoin halving, its direct impact on the crypto market, and particularly, how it affects both miners and individual investors.Bitcoin to Reach $300,000 by 2025 End
Quigley first touched on Bitcoin’s price forecast post-halving, elaborating how the market would adjust to the event based on previous records.“There is a historically Bitcoin prices increased the months following the Bitcoin halving,” said Quigley. “For the first halving in November 2012, Bitcoin went up 100 times from its pre happening level, $12 to $1,200.”“The second halving, it went up about 30 times, from $650 to $20,000. And the third halving, it went up eight times, from $8,500 to about $19,500,” he said.Though Bitcoin price has always been surging following the halving events, Quigley pointed out that the multiple has kept dropping, from 100 times, to 30 times, and the most recent eight times.“So, you know, maybe four times, three times this time,” he predicted. If Bitcoin price were to regain the $70,000 level by [presumably] April 20, four times of its value could exceed the $300,000 mark.Quigley also incorporated historical statistics of the previous post-halving rally cycles, suggesting that it would take 500 days to 18 months for Bitcoin to hit the next all-time high, which would be October 2025 for this fourth event.Bitcoin Halving’s Impact on Miners and Investors
The crypto veteran continued to analyze the chain of reactions from Bitcoin miners, individual investors, and financial institutions post-halving.William Quigley“In order for Bitcoin to continue to function the way it’s supposed to, we need to be reducing the number of daily Bitcoin mined,” said Quigley “So we’ll drop from 900 to 450 beginning [presumably] on April 20.”The reduction of mining rewards would then pose significant challenges and opportunities for the miners. “Now, a few months ago when Bitcoin was like 40,000, most of the Bitcoin miners were profitable… At 67,000, what it is today, they’re very profitable,” said Quigley.Even if Bitcoin price may skyrocket to boost the profit margin of mining operations, the competition will probably intensify proportionally as more industry players seek to benefit from the rally.For individual investors, the halving event presents a nuanced landscape. Quigley’s advice leans towards a long-term investment horizon.Unlike a traditional company which has makes its own profits and releases new products, Quigley emphasized that Bitcoin operates as an open-source platform maintained and utilized by a community of independent users.Therefore, traditional financial metrics cannot determine Bitcoin’s value. “Bitcoin is valued purely by sentiment of the people who are buying and selling it,” said Quigley.“If you’re trying to trade on sentiment on a daily basis, that sentiment is random. It goes up and down throughout the day. I wouldn’t trade it,” shared Quigley. “If you are going to buy Bitcoin first or any crypto, it should be a very, very small percentage of your net worth.”“Also, never buy crypto unless you are able to hold it for five years,” he added. “Which doesn’t mean you do hold it for five years, but you have the ability to hold it for five years.”More Crypto Quant Trading Firms Post Bitcoin Halving
Regarding institutional players in the industry, the Tether and WAX co-founder argued that more quant trading firms specialized in crypto investment will emerge post-having due to the soaring trading volume.“In the first halving in 2012, the amount of trading volume on a daily basis was probably less than a million dollars,” said Quigley. “By the third happening in 2020, we were doing $15 billion to $30 billion a day, up to a hundred billion.”“When you have that much trading and crypto trades 24 hours a day, seven days a week, there are price disparities that people can exploit” he explained.“The primary trading volume of Bitcoin is in Bitcoin futures, if you can use leverage to exploit those, you can make a lot and you can also lose a lot,” said Quigley. “But the futures markets will always attract people who think they can take advantage of some price difference and make a lot.”

A New Crypto AI Alliance; 3 Decentralized Platforms Set to Merge | Cryptopolitan

The crypto AI industry keeps developing, with new projects springing up during this bull run. Recent developments show that SingularityNET, Fetch.ai, and Ocean Protocol are reportedly in the final stages of discussing a merger. It is reported that three crypto AI platforms could announce a merge of their tokens into an ASI (Artificial Superintelligence) token that could have a fully diluted value of about $7.5 billion. The main aim of the merger is to create an AI collective that provides an alternative decentralized alternative. According to Ocean Protocol, the merger will create an $ASI token that will accelerate the race to Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) and compete against Big Tech on AI development, use, and monetization. The new crypto AI project is set to lead the transformative phase in AI by merging forces to create a superintelligence platform. SingularityDAO went on Twitter to announce the developments and warn crypto enthusiasts to be careful of potential scams mimicking $ASI. A New Era for Crypto-AIThe three platforms, Fetch.ai, Ocean Protocol, and SingularityNET are deeply involved in the crypto AI project, and many are starting to see their long-term vision to rival Big Tech within the AI space. “We stand now as not just the DeFi hub within the SingularityNET ecosystem, but now the wider AGI domain. SingularityDAO is excited to continue bridging the gap between AI and finance, furthering growth and innovation” SingularityDAO on Twitter. The goal is to improve decentralized finance through AI. There’s a lot yet to be announced regarding the partnerships, including the 2024 Roadmap, which will shed more light on the vision and mission of the firm. Impact of Crypto AI merger on token holdersAccording to Ocean Protocol’s detailed explanation on Twitter, those currently in possession of $FET and $AGIX will need to vote on the token merger proposal. However, the $OCEAN community will not be required to vote as Ocean relinquished all control over the $OCEAN token after the max supply mint. $FET will then be rebranded to $ASI with a 2.63 billion total token supply. The $OCEAN holders will migrate to $ASI at a convection rate of 0.433226:1. The conversion rate for $AGIX to $ASI migration will be 0.433350:1.The leadership team remains interestingly the same, with big names from each platform receiving a leadership role at $ASI. Reportedly, Humayun Sheikh from Fetch.ai will be the chairman, and Ben Goertzel from SingularityNET will assume the CEO position. Trent McConaghy and Bruce Pon will represent Ocean Protocol, while Janet Adams will represent SignularityNET. Fetch.ai, through Humayun Sheikh, said, “Our mission with this token merger is to combine our platforms to ensure ethical and transparent AI…This enhances data privacy and paves the way for a more democratic and trustworthy AI ecosystem.” The merger is poised to create a powerhouse in crypto AI, which will become a learning tool in AGI’s research and development, application, and commercialization.

BlackRock's Bitcoin Bet Pays Off As IBIT ETF Crushes Records, Leaves CEO Larry Fink 'Pleasantly Surprised' - BlackRock (NYSE:BLK) - Benzinga

BlackRock Inc.

                        A South Korean civil servant was arrested on March 27 on charges of committing crypto-related fraud and carrying out voice phishing attacks.According to Fn News, the accused is a level six district office official in her 50s. Police said she “received money from multiple victims.”Police say she converted the fiat to Bitcoin (BTC). She then reportedly sent the coins to a “voice phishing gang member.”South Korean Civil Servant ‘Worked for Voice Phishing Gang’
Police in Seoul’s Dongdaemun District said they had arrested the woman “on charges of fraud” at a bank in the Jegi Neighborhood.Officers said that the civil servant “converted over $74,000 worth of her voice phishing fraud funds into Bitcoin.”She then allegedly sent the coins “to a voice phishing organization member.” This person allegedly paid her “a fee” for her activities.Seoul’s Dongdaemun District. (Source: Brit in Seoul [CC BY-SA 4.0])The woman reportedly stated she was “deceived” into joining the gang by an individual. This person, she claimed, said she could make money “through legitimate means.”A police spokesperson said officers were still “investigating evidence.” Officers said they were also “identifying potential additional victims.”Officers said they had searched addresses connected to the civil servant, and were now examining additional data.Police said they were “conducting an investigation” into whether the public official had used “information she learned at work” to prey on potential victims.Rise in Crypto Crime?
In recent years, police have noted an uptick in crypto-related crimes, including voice phishing. Attackers often pose as civil servants, tax service workers, or bank employees.They often tell potential victims that their bank accounts are under attack or that they are being investigated for tax-related offenses.Attackers often tell victims that they have the power to solve these issues, and invariably request bank or crypto transfers to help “fund” their “solutions.”In June 2023, the nation was stunned by the case of a government worker who allegedly escaped to the Philippines after stealing around $3.5 million from the National Health Insurance Corporation (NHIC).The NHIC operates South Korean nursing care funds. The civil servant allegedly embezzled the money from April 2022 to September 2022.He then reportedly converted the money to crypto. He then allegedly fled to live a “life of luxury” at an expensive resort in the Philippines.Local police arrested the man in January this year, and he was repatriated to face charges shortly after.In 2022, photographers caught a “high-ranking” South Korean civil servant buying Dogecoin (DOGE) on his cell phone in the middle of a key local government meeting.

Could Bitcoin Whales' $7 Billion Move Signal a Bullish Trend?


							

Whales buy over 100K BTC in a week, signaling strong confidence in Bitcoin’s future.



Despite whale accumulation, Bitcoin’s price falls below $70K, hinting at market volatility.



Bearish indicators suggest a potential downturn, but bullish momentum could reverse the trend




Bitcoin’s market is witnessing an extraordinary phase of accumulation as prominent crypto investors, often referred to as whales, have increased their stakes in the digital currency. In an aggressive expansion of their portfolios, these whales have added over 100,000 BTC, valued at approximately $7 billion, over the past week alone.







This investment highlights a profound vote of confidence in Bitcoin from its most substantial investors, suggesting a bullish outlook for its future. The details of this transaction surfaced on social media, where ali_charts drew attention to the whales’ buying spree on Twitter. 



This aggressive investment maneuver by such key market participants is viewed as a strong endorsement of Bitcoin’s long-term value. Historical patterns of similar large-scale acquisitions have frequently led to notable shifts in the market price. This hints at the possibility of an impending upward trend and sparks speculation about Bitcoin’s market trajectory.



Despite this aggressive accumulation by whales, the price of Bitcoin has faced a downturn in the last 24 hours, falling below the $70K mark. According to CoinMarketCap, Bitcoin opened the day at $71.22K but dropped to an intraday low of $69.448K, eventually stabilizing at $69.77K. This represents a 1.39% decrease for the day, mirrored by a similar decline in its market capitalization to $1.369 trillion and a 23.13% fall in its intraday trading volume to $33.892 billion.







BTC/USD 24-Hour Chart (Source: CoinMarketCap)



The technical analysis on the 4-hour chart indicates a bearish trend, as the Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) indicator trends downward at 1189. This movement, nearly crossing the signal line, suggests the forecast of potential bearish momentum in the near future. 



Additionally, the histogram bars are flattening and approaching the zero line, suggesting a decrease in price may be imminent. The RSI stands slightly above the middle line at 60.48, indicating a potential weakening of buying pressure. Originating from an overbought condition, this suggests a possible reversal and a downward price movement in the days ahead.







BTC/USD 4-Hour Chart (Source: TradingView)



Should the bearish trend persist, Bitcoin’s price is expected to target the 50% Fibonacci retracement level, acting as the immediate support. Conversely, a resurgence of bullish momentum could propel the price toward the 78% Fibonacci level, serving as the next significant resistance point above the $70K threshold.

DOGE, SHIB Face Critical Exposure Despite Binance Announcement


							

Binance added the DOGE/USDC and SHIB/USDC to its Isolated margin.



DOGE painted a bearish structure that could drive its price down to $0.16.



The 0.786 Fib level on the SHIB/USD 4-hour chart showed that the price could pull back to $0.000024.




Dogecoin (DOGE) and Shiba Inu (SHIB) were part of the cryptocurrencies linked to a recent Binance announcement. On March 27, Binance revealed that assets including SHIB, DOGE, and others have gotten new trading pairs on the Cross and Isolated margin market.



For Dogecoin, the exchange noted that it had added the DOGE/USDC pair in the Isolated margin. The SHIB/USDC pair also appeared in the same market. This disclosure meant that traders could now access better options as the exchange tried to attract more liquidity to its platform.



However, the development might also affect the prices of SHIB  and DOGE. Thus, Coin Edition looked at the potential impact on the price action.



Dogecoin (DOGE)



At press time, the price of Dogecoin did not react positively or negatively to the margin listing. According to CoinMarketCap, the coin changed hands at $0.18. This was around the same value as the last 24 hours.



The 4-hour DOGE/USD chart painted a bearish picture. This was because the Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) was negative, indicating that momentum was downwards. If the reading of this indicator remains the same, then DOGE’s price might drop to the $0.16 underlying support.







DOGE/USD 4-Hour Chart (Source: TradingView)



On a broader view, if bulls fail to arrest the decline, DOGE might dump harder toward $0.14. However, the Relative Strength Index (RSI) remained above the neutral line. If buyers sustain this momentum then the bearish prediction might be invalidated and DOGE might sustain its hold on $0.18.



Shiba Inu (SHIB)



Unlike DOGE, Shiba Inu put up a mini show as its price jumped by 2.05% in the last 24 hours. As of this writing, SHIB’s price was $0.000030. However, SHIB presented a structure similar to Dogecoin.



At press time, the RSI reading was almost the same, indicating that buying momentum was solid. However, indications from the Fibonacci retracement, suggested that bulls might lose hold of $0.000030.



This was because the 0.786 Fib level was at $0.000024. With this position, SHIB’s price might retrace in the short term. However, the conditions might change if volatility around the token spikes.







SHIB/USD 4-Hour Chart (Source: TradingView)



If buying pressure accompanies high volatility, then SHIB might rally toward $0.000035. However, increased selling volume might drag down the price toward $0.000022.

Bitcoin charts suggest the ‘dominance train’ is coming, traders say

A clear ascending triangle is forming on the Bitcoin dominance chart, signaling a potential surge in Bitcoin’s (BTC) market share, according to several crypto traders. Some, however, argue it’s going to go the other way. “The BTC dominance train is about to leave the station,” crypto trader and Into The Cryptoverse founder Benjamin Cowen declared to his 810,700 followers in a March 27 X post.Since September, Cowen claims Bitcoin’s market cap dominance has been in an ascending triangle pattern. Source: Benjamin Cowen/XAn ascending triangle pattern on a chart develops when the price consolidates between an upward trendline support and a horizontal resistance trendline.Bitcoin’s dominance — measuring Bitcoin’s share of the total crypto market capitalization — “is coming back in a big way,” crypto trader “Beanie” on X told his 194,800 followers on March 27.Beanie suggested Bitcoin’s dominance usually grows in bear markets as crypto-native investors flock to it as a safe haven, preferring its stability over more risky and speculative digital assets.Despite Bitcoin hitting an all-time high this month, Beanie added the current trend mirrors the 2018 bear market.“This is far different from the 2021 bull market where dominance fell considerably from 70% to 40%. It actually parallels the 2018-2019 bear market,” they said.Bitcoin held an 85% market dominance in March 2017, but by January 2018, it plummeted to an all-time low of 32.45%.Bitcoin dominance is currently sitting at 50.1%, according to CoinStats data.Related: Cathie Wood’s Bitcoin ETF hits daily inflow record as BTC retests $72KNot every trader agrees with the sentiment.

Coinbase Motion for Dismissal of SEC’s Lawsuit Denied


							

Judge Katherine Failla denied Coinbase’s motion to dismiss the SEC lawsuit.



Fox Business Journalist Eleanor Terrett said that the case would last at least a year.



Coinbase can file an interlocutory appeal on some or all parts of the denial, said Terrett.




United States District Judge Katherine Polk Failla has denied Coinbase’s motion to dismiss the case brought forth by the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) in June 2023 against the leading American exchange. 



Notably, Eleanor Terrett, a journalist for Fox Business, shared the next steps for Coinbase on social media platform X (formerly known as Twitter), adding that the Court will now set a full discovery schedule, and each side can request documents for the discovery process. 



“Some of this case could be undermined and exposed through discovery, so Coinbase will attempt to get as much discovery on the SEC as they can during this process, and the SEC will do the same,” sources told Terrett.



While referring to the discovery phase in the XRP lawsuit, Terrett said that the phase will act like a “window” to the mind of the SEC in the lawsuit against Coinbase. 



Further, the journalist also predicted that the case will drag on for at least a year because discovery can take “many months” and then follows “the process of filing summary judgment briefs and then a potential trial on top of that,” while adding:




 In the meantime, I’m told one of Coinbase’s more near-term options could be to file an “interlocutory appeal” on some or all parts of the denial of Motion To Dismiss if their lawyers think that it makes sense to do so. 




Notably, the SEC filed for an interlocutory appeal in the XRP lawsuit but was denied by Judge Analisa Torres, who made the historical decision that XRP was not a security when sold to retail investors.

                        BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) continues to gain traction in the cryptocurrency market, with recent data revealing a significant influx of $320 million in new investments. This surge in inflows comes as BlackRock CEO Larry Fink has praised IBIT as the “fastest-growing ETF in the history of ETFs.”In a recent interview with Fox Business, Fink expressed his surprise and satisfaction with IBIT’s performance.“Nothing has gained assets as fast as IBIT in the history of ETFs.” He emphasized that the trust’s success surpassed his expectations, particularly during its first 11 weeks of trading.IBIT Accumulates $13.5B in First 11 Weeks
Since its launch, IBIT has captured the attention of investors, accumulating a total of $13.5 billion in inflows within the first 11 weeks. Notably, on March 12, the trust reached a daily high of $849 million in flows. On average, IBIT receives over $260 million in daily inflows, contributing to its remarkable growth.Fink acknowledged the significance of this achievement, highlighting the positive impact of IBIT on the market. He emphasized that the trust has enhanced liquidity and transparency, creating a more robust ecosystem for Bitcoin investments. Fink also expressed his bullish outlook on Bitcoin’s long-term viability and the increasing demand from retail investors.Currently, IBIT holds a substantial $17.1 billion worth of Bitcoin, according to BitMEX Research. Impressively, it took only two months for the trust to surpass the $10 billion mark, a milestone that the first gold ETF took two years to achieve. Among the approved ETFs, IBIT ranks second in terms of Bitcoin holdings, trailing behind the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust, which holds $23.6 billion in BTC.Spot Bitcoin ETFs See Another Day of Net Inflows
On March 27, spot Bitcoin ETFs collectively received net inflows of $243 million. According to data from SoSoValue, BlackRock ETF IBIT had a single-day net inflow of $323 million, while Ark Invest’s ARKB recorded a single-day net inflow of $200 million.Conversely, Grayscale’s GBTC experienced a single-day net outflow of $299 million.The price of Bitcoin has maintained the $70,000 mark amid the news that the London Stock Exchange plans to introduce Exchange-Traded Notes (ETNs) for BTC and ETH in May.The decision follows the exchange’s previous announcement that it would accept applications for crypto ETNs during the second quarter of this year.In a recent note, crypto asset trading firm QCP Capital also revealed that asset managers continue to add Bitcoin allocations as a “portfolio diversifier.”Additionally, requests for structured products such as Accumulators and FCNs have flooded in, revealing a strong appetite for diversifying investment portfolios with BTC, the Singapore-based crypto firm wrote. ⁠”Anecdotally, wealth desks at major banks have been pleasantly shocked at the tremendous demand from clients for BTC spot ETFs, along with requests for structured products like Accumulators and FCNs.”QCP even said it expects the leading cryptocurrency to maintain momentum, breaking all-time highs and potentially reaching the coveted $100,000 mark.

THORChain hits $10B monthly volume as Bitcoin maxis debate safety

The decentralized liquidity protocol THORChain has notched more than $10 billion in total monthly trading volume for the first time in history. However, Bitcoin (BTC) maximalists are divided on whether the platform offers enough safety to potential borrowers. In a March 27 post to X, the official social media account for THORChain announced the milestone, with Runscan data showing that the protocol has since notched $10.26 billion this month. Source: THORChainIn a series of follow-up comments and posts, a debate between Bitcoin maximalists broke out over THORChain’s security and potential pitfalls for Bitcoiners looking to take out interest-free loans against their BTC using the platform.In a March 27 post to X, mathematician and Bitcoin investor Fred Krueger said he was “willing to take the heat” for declaring THORChain to be “real” — which is essentially saying that BTC-backed loans on the protocol were a safe bet for Bitcoiners looking to gain more in the way of liquid funds.However, Bitcoin analyst Dylan Le Clair pushed back on Krueger’s claims.“A bitcoin collateralized loan that is dependent on the exchange rate of an altcoin to offer you a ‘“0% interest no liquidation risk” loan is simply transmuting the risk,” asserted Le Clair. “You are shorting a tail that you don’t know how to quantify.”Source: Fred KruegerTHORChain is a decentralized liquidity protocol that facilitates native asset swaps across blockchains. The protocol offers interest-free loans against major crypto assets like Bitcoin and Ether (ETH) and doesn’t enforce liquidations or fixed expiry dates.

The first was that investors take the risk more obvious risk of lending their Bitcoin to a protocol that could otherwise collapse or fall victim to an exploit — which THORChain already did in 2021, although the funds were returned.The second was that investors are relying upon a centralized provider not to change its terms and conditions at a later date, exposing their loans to risk. Notably, THORChain was forced to halt its mainnet twice in 2023 amid reports of potential security vulnerabilities with the protocol.

BlackRock CEO Says ETH ETF Still Possible Even if SEC Brands ETH Security

                        BlackRock CEO Larry Fink said he is “bullish on the long term viability of Bitcoin” and thinks an ETH exchange traded fund (ETF) may still be possible even if the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) brands ETH a security.In an interview with Fox Business on Wednesday, BlackRock’s Fink was asked about the recently launched iShares Bitcoin Trust trading under the ticker symbol “IBIT” and the huge inflows.“IBIT is the fastest growing ETF in the history of ETFs. Nothing has been getting assets as fast as IBIT,” responded Fink. BlackRock CEO Bullish Bitcoin
“I’m very bullish on the long-term viability of Bitcoin,” said Fink. “I mean, look as we’re creating a market that has more liquidity and more transparency — and I’m pleasantly surprised … I would never have predicted it before we filed it [IBIT] that we were going to see this type of retail [demand]” adds Fink.The Fox Business host went on to ask Fink about the ETH ETFs and the SEC making lots of noise about declaring ETH a security which will take it out of the Bitcoin category as a commodity. How would this impact BlackRock’s ETH ETF application? Fink stressed he cannot discuss the BlackRock ETH ETF application in more detail but when pushed by the host about what will happen if the SEC brands ETH a security — it is still possible to start a ETH ETF?“I think so,” responded Fink.What Happens if the SEC Brands ETH a Security?
Currently the status of Ethereum is in limbo – ETH is not considered a security by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) — but this could all change very quickly.It has been widely reported that a number of U.S. based companies have received subpoenas attempting to label ETH as a security.Ethereum is viewed as a decentralized cryptocurrency, rather than a security. However, regulatory agencies like the SEC continue to monitor the cryptocurrency space and may provide further guidance and sudden change or new rulings in the future. It’s essential to stay updated on regulatory developments.SEC Will “Kick the Can Down the Road”
According to HANetf founder and co-CEO Hector McNeil the SEC reviewing ETH as a security is one way to delay its decision to approve ETH ETFs by “kicking the can down the road.”If the SEC moves ahead to reclassify ETH as a security this would terminate any SEC applications with ETH ETFs in its current form, explains Laurent Kssis, head of CEC Capital.“You cannot change an asset overnight from commodity to securities as the ETH futures are considered defacto non-security and not within the scope of the CFTC and not within its regulatory framework,” Kssis told Cryptonews in an interview.

Will BONK or FLOKI become a top 3 memecoin after this update? - AMBCrypto



Binance listed USDC pairs for BONK and FLOKI.
Despite the development, price of both the tokens moved in negative direction.

After having a look at the general trajectory of the crypto market since the beginning of the year, it is safe to say that the memecoin sector has gained the most in this period. For coins such as BONK [BONK] and Floki [FLOKI], the rally could continue.
The reason would be Binance’s recent listing of BONK and FLOKI’s USDC pairs on its platform. As Binance is one of the largest Centralized Exchanges (CEX) in the crypto space, the development could benefit these memecoins to a large extent.
Binance’s vast user base exposes the tokens to a much wider audience, increasing their visibility and potentially attracting new investors. This can lead to a rise in demand for BONK and FLOKI, which could drive their prices up. It could also increase the market cap of these tokens and help them flip WIF and PEPE to enter the top 3 memecoins club.
BONK continues to bleed
Despite this update, the price of both of these tokens suffered over the last 24 hours. BONK witnessed a drop of 2.16% and was trading at $0.00002582 at the time of writing.
The correction was part of a larger trend that started on the 4th of March. After testing the $0.00004820 levels, the price of BONK fell materially while exhibiting multiple lower lows and lower highs, indicating a bearish trend.
The price fell till the $0.00001934 level before witnessing an upward momentum, which could have been driven by the recent Binance update.
However, the uptick wasn’t significant enough to reverse the ongoing trend. Bonk’s CMF (Chaikin Money Flow) also declined during this period, implying that the overall money flow for the memecoin has fallen.
Source: Trading View
FLOKI holders could still stay hopeful
FLOKI, on the other hand, witnessed a significant correction of 7.72% in the last 24 hours. At press time, FLOKI was trading at $0.0002332.
While a 7% decline in price may appear significant at first glance, when considering the broader price chart of SHIB, it doesn’t appear to be particularly substantial.

Realistic or not, here’s FLOKI’s market cap in BTC’s terms

The price was still observed to be moving particularly close to the  $0.0002558 level which had been tested multiple times. If momentum around the token is picked back up, the price of FLOKI may test the $0.0003092 level that has already been tested in the past.
However, the RSI was at 48.31 at the time of writing, indicating that the price may move sideways for some time before making a large move in either direction.

Cathie Wood’s Bitcoin ETF hits daily inflow record as BTC retests $72K

ARK 21Shares’ spot Bitcoin (BTC) exchange-traded fund (ETF) managed to notch a record $201.8 million of inflows on Wednesday, almost quintupling its average daily inflows as Bitcoin just fell short of reaching $72,000.Preliminary data from Farside Investors revealed that on March 27, the ARK 21Shares Bitcoin ETF's daily inflow was a four-fold increase from its daily average of $43.9 million since its launch on Jan. 11.It also nearly tripled the amount from the previous day when ARK Invest saw inflows of $73.6 million, while there were no recorded inflows on March 25.Bitcoin ETF flow table. Source: Farside InvestorsMeanwhile, the Valkyrie Bitcoin ETF (BRRR) witnessed $5.1 million in inflows, the Invesco Galaxy Bitcoin ETF (BTCO) saw $4.8 million in inflows, the Franklin Bitcoin ETF (EZBC) had $4 million in inflows and the VanEck Bitcoin ETF (HODL) noted $1.9 million.Both the WisdomTree Bitcoin ETF (BTCW) and Fidelity Investments Bitcoin ETF (FBTC) reported $1.5 million in inflows — all single-digit inflows. However, BlackRock data has yet to come in at the time of writing.It comes as Bitcoin hit $71,670 before falling below the $69,000 support level before closing the day at $69,698. At the time of publication, Bitcoin’s current price is $69,464, as per CoinMarketCap data.Crypto commentators, meanwhile, have begun to argue that investors are too fixated on Bitcoin’s short-term price fluctuations rather than considering the broader perspective.In a March 28 post on X, crypto researcher Gumshoe informed his 28,900 followers that investors are opting for a micro perspective, focusing on daily price closures rather than considering the actual influx of funds into Bitcoin.“Bitcoin ETFs seeing ATH inflows and people are panicking over the daily close of a candle,” he stated.Related: Bitcoin ETFs see $15M comeback as BTC price taps best close in 10 daysIn a March 27 post on X, chief investment officer of Bitwise Matt Hougan stated that the majority of professional investors are still unable to buy Bitcoin ETFs, especially in the United Kingdom where “the FCA is still broadly aligned against crypto.”“The truth is, most professional investors still cannot buy bitcoin ETFs. That will change through a series of 100+ individual due diligence processes over the next two years,” he stated.Popular crypto commentator Bitcoin Munger told his 31,800 followers he believes the next $13 billion of inflows could “add $50K-$70K or more to the price.” On March 18, Cointelegraph reported that a total of $13.2 billion in new capital has flowed into investment products such as spot Bitcoin ETFs year-to-date.Magazine: China will intensify Bitcoin bull run, $1M by 2028: Bitcoin Man, X Hall of Flame

1.1 Million daily users on Polygon: MATIC's next move? - AMBCrypto



Polygon was the sixth-largest chain in terms of total stablecoin supply.
Whales have shown lukewarm interest towards MATIC.

The Polygon [MATIC] chain has been experiencing higher user participation and liquidity infusion in 2024, causing the broader market to sit up and take notice.
Polygon sees rise in stablecoin supply
According to AMBCrypto’s analysis of DeFiLlama’s data, Polygon’s stablecoin market cap hit nearly $1.5 billion as of this writing, marking an impressive 18% growth year-to-date (YTD). As of this writing, it was the sixth-largest chain in terms of total stablecoin supply.
Source: DeFiLlama
Stablecoins can be construed as the on-chain equivalent of cash in traditional financial markets. A higher stablecoin marketcap indicates a larger pool of liquidity, making trading on the chain easier, and thereby leading to a more efficient market.
That being said, the current levels still remained a far way off from the peak registered in July 2021. In reality, Polygon’s next aim should be the pre-bear market level of $2.6 billion achieved in September 2022.
The best-performing ETH scaling solution
The rise in stablecoin market cap comes alongside an impressive surge in user engagement on the network.
According to AMBCrypto’s examination of Artemis’ data, the Polygon proof-of-stake (PoS) chain massively outperformed other scaling networks in daily active addresses and transactions in 2024.
Source: Artemis
Take for instance, the daily active addresses count on Polygon PoS on the 26th of March was 1.1 million, more than triple the count of the second-best ranked chain on the list. A similar trend came to light when it came to transaction count.
Will whales show interest?
The chain’s native token MATIC rose 1.73% in the last 24 hours, taking its last seven-day gains to over 11%, as per CoinMarketCap. MATIC’s performance was in line with the broader altcoin market report card. On a YTD basis, the crypto was up 12%

Interestingly, the rise was not built on whales’ accumulation. Using Santiment, AMBCrypto noted a sharp drop in whale transactions in 2o24.
Moreover, the holdings of these influential investors remained flat during this time, implying lower engagement from whales.

                        The Hague Conference on Private International Law (HCCH) has initiated a project on digital asset tokenization. It aims to bring legal clarity to cross-border businesses engaging with digital assets.This project will encompass various digital token types. It will also explore preliminary legal questions surrounding digital securities and blockchain-based digital asset management.The intergovernmental organization aims to clarify which laws apply to cross-border businesses and how legal rulings are enforced internationally.Proposal Urges CGAP Study on Private International Law Challenges of Digital Tokens
A recent proposal recommends that the Council on General Affairs and Policy (CGAP) commission a study on the private international law implications of digital tokens, including real estate tokens, utility tokens, payment tokens, NFTs, and stablecoins.It will exclude securities, central bank digital currencies, and carbon credits.  That is because they are already under consideration in a separate project.The study aims to deliver a report with recommendations for future action to the CGAP by a scheduled meeting in 2025.Joint Project Identifies Tokenization as a Key Focus Area
Further, the project will be conducted alongside relevant specialists and external observers.Members will be invited to nominate relevant experts for the study. These experts will include legal and technical specialists in digital tokens, as well as individuals with experience in national digital token initiatives.Following the adoption of digital asset principles in 2023, the International Institute for the Unification of Private Law (UNIDROIT) collaborated with the HCCH on a joint project. Through a series of meetings, they proposed potential areas for future work.They focused on areas including: applying existing custody rules (defined by UNIDROIT) to situations beyond traditional custody, and exploring the legal implications of “linked assets” (tokenized assets).Established financial institutions are increasingly interested in the potential of tokenization.Moody’s recently highlighted a dramatic rise in the value of tokenized funds, driven by US treasury tokenization. Similarly, Bank of America anticipates tokenization will transform financial and non-financial markets within the next few years.

Digital Asset Traders Withdraw $208,000,000 Worth of Crypto From KuCoin Following Government Charges: Nansen - The Daily Hodl


								Crypto traders moved $208 million worth of digital assets off the embattled exchange KuCoin following the company’s indictment.
The blockchain analytics platform Nansen reports that $99 million worth of crypto flowed off the exchange on Ethereum (ETH) and $108 million on Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) chains.










KuCoin still holds more than $6 billion worth of assets across Ethereum, Bitcoin (BTC), Solana (SOL) and other chains, according to the analytics platform.
On Tuesday, the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) and the Commodities Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) unsealed an indictment against KuCoin and two of its founders, Chun Gan and Ke Tang.
The DOJ alleges that the duo operated an unlicensed money-transmitting business and failed to maintain an adequate anti-money laundering (AML) program. The Feds also allege the exchange has received over $5 billion worth of suspicious and criminal proceeds.
Darren McCormack, the acting special agent in charge of the New York Field Office of Homeland Security Investigations (HSI), called KuCoin an “alleged multibillion-dollar criminal conspiracy.”
“KuCoin grew to service over 30 million customers, despite its alleged failure to follow laws necessary to ensuring the security and stability of our world’s digital banking infrastructure.  The defendants’ alleged pattern of skirting these vitally important laws has finally come to an end.”

QuadrigaCX Co-Founder Targeted Over Source of Funds


Authorities from British Columbia, Canada's westernmost province, are going after Michael Patryn, a co-founder of the failed QuadrigaCX cryptocurrency exchange, according to a report by the Vancouver Sun.  B.C. has filed an unexplained wealth order in order to compel Patryn to reveal the source of his allegedly corrupt assets. This is an attempt to seize and dispose of the wealth that was acquired unlawfully. The province introduced unexplained wealth orders last year in order to fight against money laundering. Such orders also exist in the UK, New Zealand, and Ireland. The authorities allege that Patryn's cash, gold bars, expensive watches, and jewelry are related to the QuadrigaCX scam. Prior to that, Patryn denied these allegations.  As reported by U.Today, QuadrigaCX CEO Gerald Cotton died from Crohn's disease in India in late 2018, taking the password to the exchange's cold wallets with $190 million worth of crypto to his grave. It later turned out that Cotton was running a scam, with accounting firm Ernst & Young revealing that he was actually transferring funds from customer accounts to other trading platforms in order to enrich himself. There were some conspiracy theories about whether or not Cotton actually died: the Rajasthan state is known for issuing fake death certificates. The mysterious death of the Canadian crypto king even inspired Netflix to release a true crime documentary about the QuadrigaCX case. In late 2022, a mysterious transfer of 100 Bitcoins from the exchange's cold wallet puzzled the community. Last year, EY announced that it would start interim distribution to some QuadrigaCX customers.

                        The UK’s Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) on Tuesday issued new guidelines for financial services promotions on social media. These apply to formats like memes, reels, and gaming streams, highlighting the need for fairness and avoiding any misleading information.In a press release, the regulator said that companies are responsible for all their promotional content, including that created by influencers.Promoting a financial product without the requisite authorization from a duly qualified FCA-authorized person constitutes a potential criminal offense, it warned.“Consumers need to be alert to dubious adverts and scams online, but it is important that influencers ensure they’re on the right side of the rules and consider what would happen to their own reputations if they’re found to promote products illegally,” the watchdog said.FCA Removed Misleading Advertisements in 2023
“Promotions aren’t just about the likes, they’re about the law,” said Lucy Castledine, director of consumer investments at the FCA. “We will take action against those touting financial products illegally.”The financial regulator has intensified its oversight of financial promotions. Last year, it removed a higher number of misleading advertisements compared to 2022.This increased scrutiny follows the implementation of stricter rules for advertising high-risk investments, including crypto. In July 2023, the FCA issued specific guidelines on how companies must disclose information about crypto-related products across various online platforms.FCA’s Agenda for Market Integrity and Consumer Protection
The regulations extend to crypto businesses operating internationally, provided their advertising reaches UK residents. Non-compliance can lead to severe penalties, including imprisonment for up to two years and potentially unlimited fines.Further, the FCA recently outlined plans to strengthen its ability to identify and address crypto market abuse over the next year. Its business plan prioritizes consumer protection and market integrity. It also aims to foster international competitiveness within the financial sector.This initiative comes as the UK establishes itself as a major player in the global crypto space. FCA research indicates a doubling of digital asset ownership within the country between 2021 and 2022.The watchdog has faced challenges in enforcing its crypto advertising regulations. Despite issuing guidance and removing a significant number of non-compliant ads (450 alerts issued in 2023 alone), it acknowledged persistent violations by some in the industry.Still, it remains committed to upholding regulatory compliance will continue taking action against those who breach the rules.

$ETH: BlackRock's Ethereum-Powered Money Market Fund Attracts Over $240M in Just One Week | Cryptoglobe


                                
According to Bloomberg, BlackRock’s USD Institutional Digital Liquidity Fund (BUIDL), which was launched on March 20, has seen an influx of over $240 million. This tokenized fund, issued on the Ethereum blockchain, offers investments in cash, US Treasury bills, and repurchase agreements, issuing a cryptocurrency token, BUIDL, valued at $1 per token to represent share ownership.



BlackRock enables token holders to transfer BUIDL within digital wallets approved by Securitize, its partner for this venture. This move is in line with BlackRock Chairman and CEO Larry Fink’s vision of a future where all financial assets are tokenized.



Carlos Domingo, the CEO of Securitize, outlined to Bloomberg three primary use cases for the tokenized fund. It targets crypto companies managing treasuries on blockchains, including decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs), supports crypto projects in developing derivatives of Treasury bills, and offers an alternative to stablecoins for use as collateral in borrowing and trading. Domingo emphasizes the institutional nature of the fund, managed by the world’s largest asset manager, BlackRock, highlighting its security and absence of counterparty risk for crypto companies.







            
            

            
            

            
            

        

Bloomberg reports that crypto startup Ondo Finance has made a significant investment in BlackRock’s BUIDL, totaling $95 million. This places BlackRock’s fund in a growing field of tokenized money-market funds, which started with Franklin Templeton’s launch of the first US-registered tokenized fund in 2021. Unlike Franklin Templeton’s fund tokens, BENJI, which are not transferable between investors, BlackRock’s BUIDL tokens can be transferred between validated addresses, thanks to Securitize Markets’ regulatory compliance with the SEC and FINRA.



The use of the Ethereum network for the BlackRock fund comes at a time when the SEC has heightened its examination of Ether. Despite this scrutiny, Domingo separates the regulatory investigations from the blockchain infrastructure itself, praising Ethereum’s reliability and suitability for the fund’s operations.

Top Analyst Says Blue Chip Ethereum Rival Eyeing Fresh 2024 Highs, Updates Outlook on Bitcoin and Dogecoin - The Daily Hodl


								A widely followed analyst and trader is offering his prediction on three crypto assets amid a slight bump in the markets.
Starting with the layer-one blockchain Near Protocol (NEAR), the analyst pseudonymously known as Bluntz tells his 251,200 subscribers on the social media platform X that the Ethereum (ETH) rival could rise above $9.01, the 22-month high last reached a little over a week ago.










“Will NEAR be the first Layer-1 in the top-50 (by market cap) back to fresh 2024 highs? I think the answer to that will be a resounding yes.”
According to the analyst who regularly uses the Elliott Wave theory in his technical analysis, two five-wave patterns are playing out on the four-hour chart of NEAR. The Elliott Wave theory states that the main trend of the price of an asset moves in a five-wave pattern while a correction occurs in a three-wave pattern.
Based on Bluntz’s chart, one of the five-wave patterns could complete at above the $8.80 price while the second one could complete at around the $9.53 level.

NEAR is trading at $7.84 at time of writing.
Next up is Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum. Bluntz says that it is “looking” like the two largest crypto assets by market cap have formed price floors and are now destined to “start pushing higher again from here.”
Based on Bluntz’s charts, it appears that both Bitcoin and Ethereum have completed a three-wave corrective pattern to the downside on the 15-minute and one-hour timeframes, respectively.

Bitcoin is trading at $71,163 at time of writing while Ethereum is changing hands at $3,645.
Turning to Dogecoin (DOGE), Bluntz says that the largest memecoin by market cap has completed a three-wave corrective pattern on the 30-minute chart, suggesting the potential end of a downtrend.
“Starting to think it might not give deeper pullback, definitely strong, no doubt about that.”

DOGE is trading at $0.189 at time of writing.

                        Canadian authorities have filed a third “unexplained wealth order” application with the British Columbia Supreme Court targeting the co-founder of QuadrigaCX Michael Patryn to explain how assets were acquired.QuadrigaCX filed for bankruptcy in Canada in 2018 after its CEO, Gerald Cotten, died under mysterious circumstances in India, taking the only known private keys to the exchange’s wallets with him. Although some of the funds owed to the exchange’s customers have been paid back, large amounts are still missing.This latest unexplained wealth order application allows the Canadian authorities to take over assets linked to QuadrigaCX case.“Today, we have filed our third unexplained wealth order application with the British Columbia Supreme Court – a strong demonstration of our government’s commitment to take decisive action against criminals and organized crime,” said Mike Farnworth, Minister of Public Safety and Solicitor General for British Columbia, in a statement.The QuadrigaCX case has been much publicized in recent years, and was the subject of a popular 2022 Netflix documentary.Cash, Gold Bars, Rolex Watches Seized
The order will allow the forfeiture of $250,200 in cash, 45 gold bars, four luxury watches and a number of pieces of expensive jewelry contained in a safety deposit box belonging to QuadrigaCX co-founder Patryn.“The international, criminal actions of Quadriga Coin Exchange (QuadrigaCX) led to thousands of people losing their life savings,” said Farnworth.“While the fallout of cryptocurrency theft that leaves many victims in its wake is topical, what is even more timely is the recovery of these ill-gotten funds and converting them to community benefits in a public way,” said Farnworth.Proceeds From Crime Redirected to Victims
The Canadian official went on to stress that authorities will continue to take the assets from unlawful activity and redirect those proceeds made from crime to much-needed victim services programs and crime prevention initiatives, such as the anti-hate grants to communities announced on Feb. 15, 2024.“Gold bars may be highly liquid and flashy luxury goods, such as jewelry and Rolex watches, attract attention, but they are also attracting the attention of police and our government. If they are the proceeds of criminal activity like fraud, drug trafficking or money laundering, we will go after them,” said Farnworth.

Dogecoin Dev Breaks Silence on DOGE Payments in X


A prominent developer within the Dogecoin community, known by the pseudonym "Mishaboar," has sparked discussions regarding the potential integration of Dogecoin and crypto payments into X (formerly Twitter). Since Elon Musk's acquisition of the social media platform in October 2022, speculations have swirled around the incorporation of DOGE into X's payment system.Despite hints from Musk and other indicators, such as X Payments obtaining licenses for money transmitter activities in various U.S. states, the implementation of Dogecoin payments is pending.In a recent public statement, Mishaboar highlighted the ongoing debate surrounding X's payment infrastructure. Referring to Elon Musk's previous remarks, Mishaboar speculated on the possibility of crypto payments being introduced in subsequent phases of X Payments. However, the exact timeline and mechanism of integration remain uncertain, with Mishaboar suggesting potential collaborations with exchanges or brokerage platforms. The discussion expanded as other DOGE enthusiasts joined in, sharing their perspectives on the matter. Some expressed cautious optimism, emphasizing the likelihood of a gradual rollout of crypto payments, while others anticipated a longer time frame, estimating up to five years for full implementation.Operational reachMeanwhile, recent regulatory developments have seen X Payments achieve significant milestones, acquiring licenses for money transmitter activities in three additional U.S. states: Illinois, New Mexico and Oregon. This expansion enhances X Payments' operational reach, complementing existing licenses held in 19 other states.As Dogecoin continues to capture the attention of both seasoned investors and crypto enthusiasts, its potential integration into platforms like X could herald a new era of mainstream acceptance for cryptocurrencies.

Why Is Bitcoin Cash (BCH) Rising With Positive Decoupling From The Market? - Bitcoin Sistemi


Bitcoin Cash (BCH) increased by 13% ahead of the halving event expected to take place on April 4. Blockchain followers note that this event has historically preceded price increases.
Is Bitcoin Cash (BCH) Pricing Its Halving?
The current block reward for BCH is 6.25 BCH, but it will be reduced to 3,125 BCH after the halving. This decrease in the rate at which new coins are produced is expected to reduce available supply and potentially push prices up.


Open interest in BCH tracking futures also increased, indicating increased interest in leveraged bets on expected price volatility. This suggests that investors are preparing for potentially significant market movements in the near future.

Bitcoin Cash is a cryptocurrency resulting from a fork of Bitcoin. For this reason, it enters a halving process, just like Bitcoin. This situation triggers an increase in the price of BCH.





Additionally, there are 24 days left until Bitcoin's halving event. The halving is expected to occur approximately on April 24.
On the broader cryptocurrency market, however, the Bitcoin price has remained relatively stable over the past 24 hours, hovering around $70,000 after a volatile week.


Looking ahead, some investors are warning of a possible market-wide pullback if Bitcoin fails to sustain the $69,000 level in the coming days.

Is BlackRock's IBIT ETF the Fastest-Growing in History?


							

IBIT became the fastest-growing ETF, amassing $13.5B in just 11 weeks.



Larry Fink is bullish on Bitcoin as IBIT holds $17.1B in BTC.



Spot Bitcoin ETF market grows, exceeding $34.1B across nine issuers.




BlackRock CEO Larry Fink recently revealed his optimism regarding Bitcoin’s future while paying tribute to the success of the firm’s spot Bitcoin ETF, IBIT. Launched lately, IBIT has received impressive attention, becoming the fastest-growing ETF in the industry’s history, as claimed in a March 27 interview with Fox Business.







Under Fink’s leadership, BlackRock’s involvement in the crypto world with the iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) has exceeded all expectations, attracting $13.5 billion in just 11 weeks of trade. This success story marks a new chapter for the investment firm, with Fink acknowledging the unexpected high demand from retail investors. Larry Fink said:




 “IBIT is the fastest growing ETF in the history of ETFs. Nothing has gained assets as fast as IBIT in the history of ETFs.”




The ETF’s daily inflow average stands at over $260 million, with a peak single-day inflow of $849 million on March 12, data from Farside Investors reveals. Moreover, the surge in interest and investment has propelled IBIT to hold $17.1 billion in Bitcoin, a feat achieved in record time compared to traditional investment vehicles like the first gold ETF. 







Such rapid accumulation highlights the growing acceptance and interest in cryptocurrencies as a viable investment option. With this achievement, IBIT only trails behind the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust, which remains the largest holder of Bitcoin with $23.6 billion in assets.The broader market for spot Bitcoin ETFs has also seen significant growth, with total holdings exceeding $34.1 billion across nine issuers, excluding Grayscale. Among these, IBIT, along with the Fidelity Wise Origin Bitcoin Fund (FBTC) and ARK 21Shares Bitcoin ETF (ARKB), leads the pack in attracting inflows, showcasing the burgeoning interest in digital assets among investors.

Elon Musk offers free premium features on X, crypto scammers included

Elon Musk will no longer charge influential accounts on X for certain premium features as long as they meet certain conditions. However, those conditions also appear achievable for accounts involved in cryptocurrency scams.On March 28, Musk announced that accounts with 2,500 verified subscribers as followers will no longer need to pay for “Premium” features on X. Additionally, accounts with over 5,000 followers will get free access to “Premium+.”Source: Elon MuskX offers paid subscriptions for three tiers of premium services — Basic, Premium and Premium+ — incrementally unlocking more features for content creators within the X platforms. However, the ability to purchase verification on Twitter allows scammers and bad actors to easily impersonate influential people and dupe their followers into various scams.Elon Musk rolled out the paid verification model on X, earlier known as “Twitter Blue,” to fight scammers and spammers thriving on the platform before his takeover. Regardless, the crypto community argues that the X Premium features continue to aid scammers in reaching potential victims more effectively. While some community members appreciated Musk’s decision not to charge popular account verification fees, skeptics pointed out possible loopholes, given the lack of information about the platform’s internal mechanism to ensure eligibility. Prominent game developer Tyler Glaiel argued:“Haha so a bot farm can buy 2500 accounts and then use those to verify infinite accounts (or have them all follow each other and then stop paying?)”Few users — while acknowledging the costs involved — echoed Glaiel’s sentiment in speculating that the new feature could incentivize large groups of scammers to join hands and repurpose accounts for different types of cyberattacks.Some smaller accounts on X believe that Musk’s recent move incentivizes the “rich,” while others urged fellow verified users to play the system by following each other in order to claim free premium services. Related: X launches dedicated payments account, crypto community speculatesX is well aware of the concerns around verified scam accounts as, earlier in January 2024, the platform scaled back pricing for verified organizations on the social media platform. The move was aimed at countering numerous “gold check” accounts dedicated to pushing crypto scams.Source: VerifiedA recent CloudSEK report highlighted that “malicious campaigns are brooding on a large scale that requires a Twitter Gold account,” targeting X users with job and crypto scams. However, many speculated the price drop may have been an attempt to gain more paid subscribers. Magazine: ‘SEAL 911’ team of white hats formed to fight crypto hacks in real time

FTX Fallout: Victims' Stories Pile Up As Sam Bankman-Fried Faces Judge


								The upcoming sentencing of Sam Bankman-Fried, founder of the now-bankrupt FTX cryptocurrency exchange, is taking on a new dimension as the emotional and financial wreckage left behind by the company’s collapse comes to light.

The US Department of Justice submitted 52 victim impact statements to the court, painting a grim picture of lives upended and dreams shattered. A former member of the FTX Unsecured Creditors Committee detailed the loss of his entire $4 million life savings, forcing him out of work and into a deep depression. The incident, according to his statement, even strained his marriage.
FTX Victims Reveal Their Miseries


For an Italian woman, the collapse of the crypto exchange was a brutal double blow. Having previously lost funds in another crypto platform, Celsius Network, she saw FTX as a safe haven. However, the exchange’s demise triggered severe mental trauma, further impacting her marriage.
Another victim recounted how he poured his savings into FTX, lured by the exchange’s high-profile advertising and the promise of a future business venture. Now, with FTX gone, those dreams have vanished.
These are just a few of the harrowing stories emerging, each highlighting the human cost of the FTX debacle.
Beyond the financial losses, the statements reveal a deep sense of betrayal. Victims trusted the company, a seemingly established exchange, only to have their faith shattered.

Total crypto market cap at $2.5 trillion on the daily chart: TradingView.com
Many argue that the current legal proceedings fail to adequately address their needs. One victim, for instance, stressed the importance of valuing lost assets based on their current market value, not just their worth at the time of FTX’s bankruptcy filing.
There’s a glimmer of hope, however. The recent sale of FTX’s shares in artificial intelligence firm Anthropic for $884 million could provide a source of funds for potential reimbursement. However, the path to full compensation for victims remains unclear, and the legal complexities of asset valuation and distribution are sure to present significant challenges.
DOJ Recommends 50 Years For SBF
This human cost of the FTX collapse serves as a stark reminder of the risks associated with cryptocurrency investments. While the potential for high returns exists, the lack of robust regulations can leave investors vulnerable. The FTX saga underscores the urgent need for increased oversight and investor protection in the evolving world of digital assets.

The DOJ’s sentencing memorandum recommends a prison term of 40 to 50 years for Bankman-Fried, who was convicted of seven fraud and conspiracy charges in November.
 Bankman-Fried’s defense team, on the other hand, is advocating for a lighter sentence of no more than 6.5 years. The sentencing is scheduled for 9:30 a.m. ET on March 28, as Judge Lewis Kaplan nears a decision on the case.
Meanwhile, victims look to Kaplan to consider their emotional and financial hardships when sentencing the former FTX big boss, Sam Bankman-Fried. They also hope their stories will push the Federal Court towards a more victim-centric approach to compensation.
Whether justice can truly be served for those whose lives have been irrevocably altered by the FTX collapse remains to be seen.

Bitcoin ETF Inflows Could Eclipse $1 Trillion, Predicts Bitwise CIO


                            Following a week of net outflows, the spot Bitcoin ETF market has rebounded with impressive net inflows this week, highlighting a growing investor confidence in Bitcoin and its associated financial products. This week’s market activities have shown a remarkable reversal from the previous 5-day net outflow streak, with Tuesday witnessing a substantial net inflow of $480 million, followed by $243.5 million on Wednesday.
Yesterday’s resurgence in investor interest was notably boosted by Blackrock’s massive inflow of $323.8 million, effectively offsetting Grayscale GBTC’s $299.8 million outflows. Moreover, Ark Invest’s ARKB reported its best day yet, with $200 million in inflows, despite Fidelity experiencing its worst day with a mere $1.5 million in outflows. Nevertheless, Fidelity managed to bounce back with significant inflows of $261 million and $279 million on Monday and Tuesday, respectively.


1% Down, 99% To Go For Bitcoin ETFs
However, according to Bitwise Chief Investment Officer (CIO) Matt Hougan, this is just the mere beginning of what is to come in the upcoming months. Hougan’s commentary, part of his weekly memo to investment professionals, sheds light on the current market dynamics and the colossal potential that lies ahead. “1% Down; 99% to Go,” Hougan wrote, highlighting the nascent yet promising journey of Bitcoin ETFs.

Lately, the market has been characterized by its volatility, with Bitcoin’s price oscillating between $60,000 and $70,000. Hougan advises a calm and long-term perspective amidst this fluctuation, especially as the sector anticipates the upcoming Bitcoin halving around April 20, the approval of Bitcoin ETFs on national account platforms, and the soon-to-come completion of due diligence by various investment committees.
Despite the current sideways movement of Bitcoin’s price, Hougan remains bullish about its long-term trajectory. “Bitcoin is in a raging bull market,” he asserts, noting a nearly 300% increase over the past 15 months. The launch of spot Bitcoin ETFs in January has marked a significant milestone, opening up the Bitcoin market to investment professionals on an unprecedented scale.
Hougan’s analysis points to a profound shift as global wealth managers, who collectively control over $100 trillion, begin to explore investments in the “digital gold.” He suggests that even a conservative allocation of 1% of their portfolios to Bitcoin could result in approximately $1 trillion of inflows into the space.

This perspective is backed by historical data showing that even a 2.5% allocation to Bitcoin has enhanced the risk-adjusted returns of traditional 60/40 portfolios in every three-year period of Bitcoin’s history.
The recent inflows into Bitcoin ETFs, though impressive, are seen by Hougan as merely the beginning of a much larger movement. “We are all excited about the $12 billion that has flowed into ETFs since January. And it is exciting: Collectively, the most successful ETF launch of all time..But imagine global wealth managers allocate just 1% of their portfolios to bitcoin on average,” Hougan elaborates, emphasizing the scale of potential growth awaiting the cryptocurrency market. He concludes:
Think about the implications. […] A 1% allocation across the board would mean ~$1 trillion of inflows into the space. Against this, $12 billion is barely a down payment. 1% down, 99% to go.
At press time, BTC traded at $70,644.

Interoperability Protocol LayerZero Soars to $3B Valuation


							

LayerZero achieved a valuation of $3 billion, following growing interest from prominent venture capital firms.



Anticipation is mounting around LayerZero’s token airdrop, expected to occur soon.



World Economic Forum praised the protocol’s technology and models.




Omnichain interoperability protocol LayerZero has garnered significant attention from prominent investors, resulting in a valuation of $3 billion. With anticipation building around its upcoming yet-to-be-launched token airdrop, the growing interest solidifies the protocol’s impact.



LayerZero is reportedly designed to seamlessly connect blockchains while ensuring smooth cross-chain transactions with its models. Moreover, LayerZero’s ZRO airdrop is expected to occur soon, fueling investors’ interest in the token.



According to reports, several projects are built on or utilizing LayerZero’s technology, including the bridging platform Stargate, the RWA gaming asset tokenization protocol MetaZero, the decentralized lending and borrowing protocol Radiant Capital, and the decentralized exchange Trader Joe.









It is widely believed that interaction with LayerZero integrated platforms and protocols could provide traders and investors with a strategic advantage in terms of the increased likelihood of receiving the ZRO airdrop.



Additionally, reports added that the omnichain interoperability protocol is backed by prominent venture capital firms such as a167, Sequoia, and Coinbase Ventures. These partnerships led LayerZero’s $120 million raise to reach a $3 billion valuation.



Another reported method to keep an eye on the ZRO airdrop is by monitoring the protocol’s Discord activity. LayerZero’s Discord channel serves as a means of interaction with the community and its members, providing answers to questions and assistance.



The World Economic Forum (WEF) highlighted LayerZero’s technology, stating that the protocol “standardizes how information is passed across any blockchain.” Moreover, the WEF added that LayerZero has facilitated the movement of $50 billion in value and accounted for 97% of cross-chain message volume.

Ethereum reaches 1M validators, community thinks it’s ‘too much’

The Ethereum network recently hit the one million validator milestone, with 32 million Ether (ETH) currently staked, valued at approximately $114 billion based on current market prices.On March 28, the Dune Analytics dashboard created by Hildobby to track Ethereum staking progress showed that the network achieved a validator count of one million, with the 32 million ETH staked accounting for 26% of the total supply.The data also showed that around 30% of the ETH is staked using the Ethereum staking pool Lido, a liquid staking platform for proof-of-stake (PoS) cryptocurrencies. Staking pools like Lido remain popular because they allow users with a smaller amount of ETH to pool their assets and participate.Ethereum reaches one million validators. Source: DuneValidators ensure the security of a blockchain by monitoring the network for any malicious transactions, such as double-spending, which is essentially spending the same currencies twice. In Ethereum, validators participate in proposing and validating transactions within the network. Those who wish to participate in this process are required to stake 32 ETH. In return, they get a small portion of ETH as a reward. While the number of validators could translate into higher security for a blockchain, some community members think too many validators could pose a problem. Source: Gabriel WeideVenture investor and Ethereum advocate Evan Van Ness said there’s arguably already “too much” staked. Gabriel Weide, who runs a staking pool, believes that too many validators can eventually lead to “failed transactions.” Meanwhile, Peter Kim, the head of engineering at Coinbase Wallet, said that while the number of validators is “impressive,” it’s “artificially inflated by the 32 ETH cap.” However, he suggested this may change soon. Related: Vitalik Buterin on fix for Ethereum centralization: Make running nodes easierAs the number of validators continues to rise, Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin proposed a way to improve the network’s decentralization. On March 27, Buterin published a blog post proposing to penalize validators in proportion to their average failure rate.If many validators fail in a given slot, each failure’s penalties will be higher. Such an approach could potentially reduce the advantage of large ETH stakers over smaller ones, according to Buterin. Magazine: ETH a security?

                        Bitcoin Price PredictionAmid fluctuating markets, Bitcoin dips below $70,000, spotlighting debates on its future price. U.S. and U.K. sanctions against Gaza Now’s crypto operations underscore ongoing regulatory scrutiny, possibly influencing Bitcoin’s trajectory. Meanwhile, BlackRock’s bullish stance and the success of its Bitcoin ETF highlight growing institutional interest. Casa’s new inheritance solution for Bitcoin ensures secure asset transfers, enhancing trust in cryptocurrency as a long-term investment amidst evolving regulatory and market landscapes. Let’s take a look at intraday Bitcoin price prediction. The US and UK Sanction Crypto Addresses Linked to Gaza Group







The United States and the United Kingdom have imposed sanctions on crypto addresses associated with ‘Hamas-aligned’ Gaza Now and its founder, Mustafa Ayash. These measures come in response to Hamas’ fundraising activities following the October 7 incident in Israel.
Despite Gaza Now’s effort to raise funds through cryptocurrency, contributions remained low, with only $21,000 received post-attack.
Data from Elliptic and TRM Labs indicates that most crypto donations to such groups are under $500.















While these developments spotlight concerns over the use of digital currencies for terrorist financing, they’re unlikely to directly affect Bitcoin prices.
However, they could lead to heightened regulatory scrutiny and demands for tighter controls on crypto transactions, potentially impacting investor sentiment and broader crypto adoption.
Key Points:

US and UK sanction crypto addresses linked to Gaza Now and Mustafa Ayash.
Following the October 7 incident, only $21,000 in crypto donations were received.
Increased regulatory attention on crypto transactions may affect investor sentiment.

The recent approval of Hashdex’s spot Bitcoin ETF further energizes the competitive sphere.Fink’s announcement is a positive indicator of growing institutional engagement in Bitcoin, potentially buoying BTC prices as more investors turn to regulated avenues for cryptocurrency investment.Key Takeaways:
BlackRock’s CEO Larry Fink is “very bullish” on Bitcoin, with the firm’s ETF crossing $17 billion.

Bitcoin Price Prediction
Bitcoin (BTC/USD) exhibits a promising outlook, momentarily trading above the pivotal $68,558 mark, suggesting a bullish momentum. The cryptocurrency faces immediate resistance at $71,677, with subsequent thresholds at $73,383 and $75,692 potentially capping gains. Support levels at $66,844, $63,820, and $60,763 offer a safety net against downturns. Bitcoin Price PredictionThe Relative Strength Index (RSI) at 56 and a bullish engulfing candle on the 4-hour chart bolster the potential for upward movement, especially if Bitcoin sustains above the $68,500 benchmark. However, slipping below this critical level could precipitate a significant sell-off, marking a crucial juncture for Bitcoin’s near-term trajectory.Last Opportunity: Invest in Sponge V2 Before It Hits Exchanges – Secure 170% Staking Rewards!

21Shares launches staking ETP on TON

21Shares’ announcement to launch a TON-based staking ETP on the SIX Swiss Exchange has generated significant excitement within the crypto community and traditional investors. 
This move represents a significant step for the TON project, bringing it closer to the traditional market in a similar way to Bitcoin, while at the same time offering investors a new way to gain exposure to this emerging blockchain without the need to directly own the tokens.

21Shares launches staking ETP on TON
But what exactly does this new feature mean? To fully understand it, it is essential to understand what an ETP is. An Exchange Traded Product is essentially a financial security listed and traded on the traditional market, which aims to replicate the performance of a specific asset or group of assets. 
In the context of blockchain and cryptocurrencies, an ETP linked to TON offers investors the opportunity to invest in this blockchain without having to directly manage TON tokens.
This is a significant advantage for institutional and traditional investors who may be reluctant to dive directly into the world of cryptocurrencies due to the complexity and operational challenges associated.
Through the ETP staking of TON offered by 21Shares, these investors can gain exposure to the TON blockchain and benefit from its growth potential without having to deal with the challenges related to custody and direct token management.
Furthermore, the interest shown by 21Shares in TON underlines the growing acceptance and interest of financial institutions towards emerging blockchains and cryptocurrencies.
The fact that a major company like 21Shares is investing in TON through an ETP represents a significant vote of confidence in the vision and potential of this blockchain.
The challenges and uncertainties in the new vision of 21 shares
Despite the uncertainties and challenges that may accompany the adoption of new technologies and financial assets, the announcement by 21Shares marks an important step towards the integration of TON into the traditional financial landscape. 
This could lead to an increase in visibility and liquidity for TON, opening up new investment opportunities for a wide range of investors.
It is important to note that while the ETP of TON offered by 21Shares provides a new option for investors, it is essential to conduct diligent research and carefully evaluate the associated risks before investing. 
Cryptocurrencies and emerging blockchains may be subject to volatility and unique risks, and investors should be aware of such factors before making investment decisions.
Conclusions
In conclusion, the launch of the TON ETP staking by 21Shares marks a significant moment in the evolution of the cryptocurrency sector and in the convergence with the traditional market. 
This initiative offers investors a new and accessible way to gain exposure to TON, while highlighting the growing interest of financial institutions in emerging blockchains. 
The integration of TON within ETPs represents an important step towards greater adoption and acceptance of cryptocurrencies in the global financial landscape. 
However, it is essential that investors carefully examine the associated risks and conduct diligent research before making investment decisions. 
With further innovations and developments in the cryptocurrency sector, we expect to see new opportunities and challenges emerge, paving the way for greater integration and growth in both the traditional financial market and the world of cryptocurrencies.

Bitcoin: a whale from 2010 wakes up, but the price does not react

Yesterday something curious happened: the news came out that a whale moved a large amount of Bitcoins that had not moved since 2010, but when this news spread, the price of BTC did not react at all. 
Usually news like this spreads some apprehension in the market, but this time it has been completely ignored. This seems to show that the price of Bitcoin is once again going its own way at the moment, until the halving on April 20th. 

Bitcoin moved by the whale and the price reaction
The BTC were moved by the whale on Tuesday, and in total they were about 2,000. Nowadays they have a market value of about 140 million dollars, and are comparable to the amount of BTC liquidated daily by the Grayscale ETF in this period.
The fact is that those BTC have not moved since 2010, when they were mined between August and November of the same year. 
So someone who was mining Bitcoin at the time collected them and held them for 14 years, only to move them all at once yesterday.
It should be remembered that at the time Bitcoin had only been in existence for just over a year and a half, and its market value was on average less than $0.1. Overall, the 2,000 BTC moved yesterday were worth less than $200 at the time. 
Until November 2012, 50 BTC were awarded to anyone who managed to mine a block, and in fact anyone could do it using even a simple computer. To earn 2,000 BTC with mining you just needed to mine 40 blocks, and from August to November 2010 about 25,000 blocks were mined in total.
What is surprising, therefore, is not that the whale was able to accumulate 2,000 BTC in 2010, but that it has kept them for 14 years. 
The movements of the whale
It is not known who owns those BTC, but it is unlikely to be an exchange, since at that time there were very few exchanges with insignificant trading volumes. 
For example, it is enough to remember that it often happened that there were entire days without even one exchange. 
Instead, it is much more likely that he was a member of the cypherpunk community in which Bitcoin was already relatively widespread, and that he was simply accumulating BTC through mining, since at the time anyone could do it even with low-power machines. 
Moreover, it has been since 2020 that that whale moves Bitcoin collected in the early years, probably always thanks to mining.
Actually, in this March 2024 he has already made three big movements, one on March 1st, always of 2,000 BTC, and another on March 5th of 1,000 BTC. In total, he has moved 5,000 BTC only in the month of March, for a value in dollars of about 350 million.
Probably this is also why the news did not trigger sales on the current market, since these movements have been going on for some time now. 
Furthermore, it is not even known precisely what happens to those BTC once moved, because if they were sold on exchanges they could actually lower the price. 
Since this is not happening, it is presumed that they have not been moved to be sold, also because the number of Bitcoins present on the known wallets of exchanges has been decreasing in the last 30 days.
The price of Bitcoin
Yesterday, however, the price of Bitcoin recorded some movement, although not as a result of this news, and with a practically zero final balance. 
Before the opening of the US stock exchanges it was around $70,000. 
Just before their opening, it had quickly risen to over $71,500, anticipating the clearly positive opening of the US stock exchanges. 
However, as soon as the news spread that a US judge had rejected Coinbase‘s request to dismiss the SEC’s charges against the exchange, the price started to drop, reaching $68,300 a few hours later.
Once the trading session on the American stock exchanges was closed, the price of Bitcoin slowly returned to where it had started, namely $70,000, thus canceling out all the day’s losses. 
It has been lateralizing around $70,000 since Monday, without having the strength to rise above $72,000, nor the weakness to fall below $68,000. 
The rally that started in early February ended on March 14 with a new all-time high of $73,800, while the correction that started on the same day ended on Wednesday, March 20. From the same Wednesday until Sunday, it then rose back up to $70,000, and since then it has been trading sideways around this figure. 
The hypothesis circulating is that the current sideways movement could continue at least until the end of the month, while starting from next week it could return to move significantly.

The Cryptonomist

In this month of general crypto bull run, in the specific category of memecoins, it seems that FLOKI’s performance stands out compared to Dogecoin, Pepe, Shiba Inu, and Bonk. In fact, FLOKI’s price has increased by +360% in the last 30 days. 

FLOKI: its performance surpasses Dogecoin and other memecoins in this crypto bull run
FLOKI, the memecoin developed on Ethereum and also supported by Binance Smart Chain (BSC), seems to be registering the best price performance compared to Dogecoin and others in its category. 
And indeed, in the last 30 days of the crypto bull run, the price of FLOKI is up +360%, which includes the retracement that is occurring in the last week. 
Basically, at the time of writing FLOKI is worth $0.0002271, but this month it reached its maximum price of $0.000303 on March 14 and the minimum price of $0.0000429 on February 28. 
Her colleagues memecoins, on the other hand, seem to have ridden the wave of the general crypto bull run in a different way. 
Dogecoin (DOGE), the ultimate memecoin, with its total market cap of 28.91 billion dollars, has recorded a price pump of +111% in the last month. Following, the price of Shiba Inu (SHIB) up by +186%, PEPE by +190%, and BONK by +91%. 
The only memecoin to be at the same level as FLOKI seems to be dogwifhat (WIF) which, at the time of writing, is up +370% in price compared to a month ago. 
FLOKI: the top memecoin that surpasses Dogecoin and the others in this crypto bull run
Since the bull run period seems to not be over yet, there are analysts who, studying the specific category of memecoins, seem to look at FLOKI as the best. 

“According to several cryptocurrency analysts, $FLOKI will be the best #memecoin of this bull cycle. #$Floki has outperformed $DOGE, $PEPE, $SHIB, $WIF, and $BONK during the last memecoin run of this cycle.”
Actually, as already mentioned before, it seems that at the moment WIF is also dominating the memecoin scene. 
The ranking of the main memecoins sees DOGE in first place, followed by SHIB and PEPE remaining on the podium. Immediately after it’s time for WIF, then FLOKI and finally BONK.
The boom on Binance
To support the current top performance of FLOKI, it could have been its listing on the Binance crypto-exchange.
An entrance door that allowed FLOKI to see its trading volumes grow, especially for the FLOKI/USDT and FLOKI/TRY pairs. 
And indeed, at the beginning of March 2024, it was shown how 50% of FLOKI’s trading volumes were taking place on Binance.
It should be noted that the memecoin FLOKI is not as widespread as its other colleagues. In fact, on Kraken and Coinbase, FLOKI has not yet been listed.

Bitbot’s presale surpasses $1.5m
The Bitbot presale is in the seventh stage and has already raised more than $1.5m. The 7th stage will end once the amount raised reaches $1.63m.

Could $BITBOT rally higher this year?
The crypto market has been bullish since the start of the year and many analysts expect BTC to surpasses $150k in the coming months. With the Bitcoin halving roughly 20 days away, trading volume in the market could significantly go higher.
Bitbot could be a big winner in the market if it rolls out its products. The project can leverage the growing trading volume in the market to obtain a sizable market share. If that happens, its native $BITBOT token could soar higher in the coming months and years.

                        Amazon has invested $4 billion in ChatGPT’s rival artificial intelligence (AI) startup Anthropic, solidifying its minority ownership in the company. In a recent announcement, the e-commerce and technology giant revealed that it has injected an additional $2.75 billion into Anthropic, following an initial investment of $1.25 billion made back in September.Anthropic, founded in 2021 by former members of OpenAI, has emerged as a notable competitor to ChatGPT with its own AI chatbot named Claude. The company recently unveiled Claude 3, its most advanced version capable of analyzing images alongside its chat capabilities.ChatGPT Rival Anthropic Chooses AWS as its Cloud Provider
As part of the investment deal, Amazon disclosed that Anthropic has chosen Amazon Web Services (AWS) as its primary cloud provider for critical workloads, including safety research and future model development. Anthropic will leverage AWS Trainium and Inferentia chips to construct, train, and deploy its upcoming models.“We have a notable history with Anthropic, together helping organizations of all sizes around the world to deploy advanced generative artificial intelligence applications across their organizations,” Swami Sivasubramanian, Vice President of Data and AI at AWS, said. He referred to generative AI as “the most transformational technology of our time.”In addition to its significant AI investments, Amazon recently launched its own AI-powered assistant, Amazon Q, tailored for businesses. Amazon Q boasts chatbot capabilities, problem-solving abilities, content creation, and more.While ChatGPT might be dominating the AI space in terms of popularity, Amazon’s investment in Anthropic is not the only one among tech giants eyeing the promising AI startup. In October of last year, Google announced a $500 million investment in Anthropic, with plans to increase it to $2 billion.However, like many prominent AI chatbot developers, Anthropic has faced legal disputes concerning copyright and data infringement. The company battled a lawsuit filed by music label Universal Music Group (UMG) in January. UMG accused Anthropic of “unlawful” use, copying, and dissemination of copyrighted works from their catalog during AI training.Three Major AI Blockchain Firms Merge
SingularityNET, Fetch.ai, and Ocean Protocol are planning a merger of their crypto tokens to establish a decentralized AI platform and foster collaboration among the three companies.The companies are exploring the creation of an ASI token, which would possess a fully diluted value of approximately $7.5 billion.While the merger plans are subject to approval from the respective communities, an official announcement could be expected as early as Wednesday. Under the proposed arrangement, SingularityNET, Fetch.ai, and Ocean Protocol would maintain their separate operations while working together under the guidance of a newly formed entity called the Superintelligence Collective. However, not everyone is optimistic about AI-related crypto tokens. In a recent research report, leading crypto exchange Coinbase said the surge in the AI token market may be driven more by hype than actual utility.The report suggested that the value potential of many AI tokens may be overstated due to the prevailing attention on the AI industry, and that these tokens may lack sustainable demand-side drivers in the short to medium term.

Hong Kong-based Asset Manager VSFG aiming for a May spot Bitcoin ETF launch



                    

                    
There are reports that the Hong Kong SFC is considering to approve Bitcoin ETFs in Q2 2024.
VSFG and Value Partners have applied for approval to offer a spot Bitcoin ETF in Hong Kong.
VSFG is targeting to launch the spot BTC ETF as early as May this year.

Hong Kong’s financial landscape is set for a potential transformation as Venture Smart Financial Holdings Ltd (VSFG), a prominent asset management company, gears up to launch a spot Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) in the country as early as May.
Collaborating with local firm Value Partners, VSFG has filed an application with the Hong Kong Securities and Futures Commission (SFC) to introduce this innovative investment product to the market.
Hong Kong’s stand on Bitcoin ETFs
Following regulatory considerations initiated in December 2023, Hong Kong regulators have been actively contemplating the approval of spot crypto ETFs within the region.
Earlier, Bloomberg Senior ETF Analyst Eric Balchunas in a post on X, citing a Bloomberg Intelligence report, stated that the SFC is considering allowing in-kind creations and redemptions for spot bitcoin ETFs in the second quarter of this year.
If true, the move will underscore Hong Kong’s growing reputation as a crypto-friendly hub where financial institutions can readily offer innovative products to local investors.
Industry leaders have echoed the sentiment, urging regulators to expedite the launch of spot ETFs in Hong Kong to meet the increasing demand from investors.
Bitcoin ETF boom and its impact
The approval of spot Bitcoin ETFs in the United States in January sparked a surge in offerings by major financial institutions such as Grayscale, BlackRock, and Fidelity Investments. Accumulating approximately $50 billion in assets within a few months, these ETFs have significantly boosted investor engagement in the crypto market.
Moreover, the approval of Bitcoin ETFs coincided with a substantial BTC price escalation, with its value skyrocketing from around $30,000 to as high as $73,700 in March. Currently trading at $70,630, Bitcoin’s value is poised for further growth, especially with the anticipated approval of spot ETFs in Hong Kong.
VSFG’s move to apply for a spot Bitcoin ETF aligns with the broader trend of financial institutions capitalizing on the growing interest in cryptocurrency investment products. If approved, the ETF would streamline the investment process for Hong Kong-based investors, providing them with a regulated and accessible avenue to gain exposure to Bitcoin.
With the potential launch of the spot Bitcoin ETF in May, VSFG aims to position itself at the forefront of Hong Kong’s evolving financial landscape, catering to the increasing demand for crypto investment opportunities in the region.

Mike Novogratz, the cofounder and chief executive officer (CEO) of Galaxy Digital, has shared another hot take on why he believes owing Bitcoin (BTC) as an asset class is essential.Debt spiral analogy and BitcoinAccording to Mike Novogratz, the state of the United States debt deficit is notably alarming. He said that what many do not want to hear is how the government needs to cut its spending drastically while levying heavy taxes on the wealthy class.He said any major loophole through which cash is reduced also needs to be covered. He said if these recommendations are done the right way, America may get to prevent slipping into a debt death spiral in the long term. He pointed out that the current government debt is pegged at about $34 trillion, a figure that grows every 100 days.If left unchecked, Mike Novogratz is convinced the debt may soar as high as $37 trillion without an end in sight. The financial guru noted that this debt challenge makes it easier to convince anyone to buy Bitcoin or other assets. Case for BitcoinBitcoin is considered a major hedge against currency devaluation and a store of value, accounting for why firms like MicroStrategy Incorporated have continued buying the cryptocurrency at every opportunity it gets.Rather than the U.S. Dollar, which is being printed indiscriminately, Bitcoin has a maximum supply of 21 million. This sum is emitted in bits, and the last Bitcoin will not be mined until 2140, owing to the provisions encoded in the BTC halving event. This makes the digital currency a very scarce commodity overall.Galaxy Digital and Invesco co-own a spot Bitcoin ETF, a product that also contributes to the scarcity of Bitcoin through intense, regular accumulations. In all, Mike Novogratz implied that, unlike the USD, which is being devalued, these fundamentals might help Bitcoin gain more traction this year and in the long run.

Should you ditch Dogecoin for ICP? Here's what the market is telling you - AMBCrypto



The values of ICP and DOGE have risen by double digits in the last week.
Both altcoins appear ready to extend their price rallies.

Internet Computer [ICP] outperformed Dogecoin [DOGE] last week, as its value climbed by over 50% during the seven-day period, according to CoinMarketCap. Leading memecoin DOGE managed only a 30% price uptick during that period.
The double-digit rally in the values of both altcoins mirrors the general market growth witnessed in the last week. According to CoinGecko’s data, the global cryptocurrency market capitalization increased by 4% during that period.
Both tokens are ready to extend their gains
AMBCrypto’s assessment of ICP and DOGE’s price movements on a 24-hour chart revealed the possibility of further price gains.
Trading at a two-year high at press time, ICP exchanged hands at $17.85. Confirming the recent uptrend, its Aroon Up Line (orange) was 92.86%. This indicator measures an asset’s trend strength and potential trend reversal points in its price movement.
When an asset’s Aroon Up Line returns a value close to 100, it indicates that the current market uptrend is strong and that the most recent high was reached relatively recently.
Also, readings from the altcoin’s Directional Movement Index (DMI) showed its positive directional index (green) resting significantly above its negative index (red). 
When these trend lines are positioned this way, the buying pressure in the market is significantly higher than the selling pressure. It also indicates a strong uptrend in the price of the asset.
Further, the gap between these lines is also noteworthy because the wider it is, the stronger the trend is considered to be. The gap between ICP’s positive and negative directional indexes was considerably wide at the time of writing.
At press time, the token’s Money Flow Index (MFI) trended upward and returned a value of 80.36, indicating that the price rally was backed by real demand. This showed that market participants favored ICP accumulation over selling their holdings for profit.

DOGE follows suit
Regarding meme coin DOGE, readings from some of its key technical indicators revealed that it followed a similar trend and was poised to extend its gains. 
For example, the coin’s MACD line crossed above its signal line on 26th March. This was a bullish signal, suggesting that the shorter-term moving average had begun gaining strength relative to the longer-term moving average.

Also, DOGE’s Parabolic SAR indicator, which tracks its potential trend direction and reversals, showed significant bullish sentiment. The dotted lines comprising the indicator rested below the coin’s price at price time.
When these dotted lines are positioned in this way, the market is deemed to be in an uptrend.

                        The Ethereum network has surpassed one million validators, with approximately 32 million Ether, worth around $114 billion, staked within the network.According to data from the Dune Analytics dashboard, which tracks Ethereum staking progress, the validator count reached the one million mark on March 28. The 32 million ETH staked represents approximately 26% of the total supply, highlighting the substantial commitment to Ethereum’s proof-of-stake (PoS) consensus mechanism.Lido Accounts for 30% of Staked ETH
Among the staking options available, about 30% of the ETH is staked through Lido, an Ethereum staking pool that allows users with smaller amounts of ETH to pool their assets and participate in the staking process.Validators play a crucial role in maintaining the security of the Ethereum blockchain by monitoring transactions for any malicious activities, such as double-spending. In Ethereum, validators propose and validate transactions within the network, requiring a stake of 32 ETH. In return for their participation, validators receive rewards in the form of a portion of ETH.While a higher number of validators generally enhances blockchain security, some members of the Ethereum community express concerns about potential issues arising from an excessive number of validators. Evan Van Ness, a venture investor and Ethereum advocate, suggests that there may already be “too much” staked. Gabriel Weide, operator of a staking pool, warns that an abundance of validators could lead to an increase in “failed transactions.”Addressing the network’s decentralization, Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin recently proposed a mechanism to improve the system. In a blog post, Buterin suggested penalizing validators in proportion to their average failure rate. By implementing this approach, penalties would be higher if multiple validators fail within a given slot, potentially reducing the advantage of larger ETH stakers over smaller ones.SEC Postpones ETH ETF Decisions
The SEC has recently postponed its decision on the applications for Ether (ETH) ETFs from major financial institutions like BlackRock and Fidelity. The final deadlines for these decisions have been extended to May 2024. The SEC’s decision to extend the deadline follows its earlier postponement in December 2023, during which it sought additional public input on whether the ETF should be listed. Grayscale had proposed listing and trading shares of its Ethereum Futures Trust ETF under the New York Stock Exchange Arca Rule 8.200-E in September 2023. Bloomberg Intelligence ETF analysts James Seyffart and Eric Balchunas have both expressed their calibrated predictions of the pending approvals, expecting a potentially persisting denial in May.“Our odds of eth ETF approval by May deadline are down to 35%,” stated Balchunas. “I get all the reasons they SHOULD approve it (and we personally believe they should) but all the signs/sources that were making us bullish 2.5mo out for btc spot are not there this time.”

Dogecoin (DOGE) Explodes 10% Daily, Bitcoin (BTC) Reclaims $70K (Market Watch)


																Bitcoin slumped hard yesterday and dropped below $69,000, but the bulls have taken charge since then, and the asset now stands well above $70,000.
While most alternative coins are slightly in the green, DOGE and BCH have gone on a tear with double-digit price gains overnight.
BTC Goes Above $70K
Last week was quite negative for the largest cryptocurrency, in which it fell to under $61,000 at one point and was down to $62,500 on Friday. The weekend finally saw a recovery attempt but BTC was stopped at $66,000.
It wasn’t until Monday that the asset started actually charting meaningful increases and soared to $70,000. More gains came on Tuesday and Wednesday that culminated in jumping to almost $72,000 yesterday.
However, the cryptocurrency failed to overcome that level, and the subsequent rejection pushed it south by over three grand to $68,500. The landscape now is quite different, and Bitcoin has returned to over $70,500 as the community’s anticipation for a $100,000 price tag grows stronger.


Thanks for subscribing, you will get your first report in the next hours!

DOGE, BCH Go Up
Most altcoins were in a retrace mode yesterday but have managed to erase a large portion of the losses today. Binance Coin, Ripple, Toncoin, and Chainlink have increased by somewhere between 1% and 3%. Ethereum, SOL, ADA, and DOT are also in the green but in a more modest fashion.
Shiba Inu has gained over 4% overnight, but its increase is trumped by its older and larger brother – Dogecoin. DOGE has jumped by over 10% in a day and sits above $0.2.
Bitcoin Cash is the other notable gainer from the larger-cap alts. Just days ahead of its next halving, BCH has soared by 13% to over $550.
The cumulative market cap of all crypto assets has increased by about $50 billion overnight but still stands below $2.8 trillion.

Ethena Protocol Launches ENA Token and Announces Sustainable Strategy


							

Ethena Protocol announces the launch of its ENA token aligned with the protocol’s sustainable strategies



The protocol also announced the ENA token distribution features vesting schedule. 



The new Shard Campaign will introduce Sats Campaign, focusing on Bitcoin integration and boosted rewards.




Recently, the widely growing Ethena Protocol announced the launch of the ENA token. This launch marks a significant milestone in the evolution of digital currencies.



Notably, the protocol’s USDe supply has surged to over $1 billion, making it one of the fastest USD-denominated assets to reach this milestone in crypto history. This feat underlines Ethena’s position as a new emerging leader in the DeFi landscape.



With its growing ecosystem, Ethena has attracted key players in the DeFi space, including MakerDAO, Frax, Curve Finance, and Aave, among others. These integrations also show the growing relevance and adoption of Ethena’s USDe stablecoin within the broader DeFi ecosystem.



Scheduled for April 2nd, users will have the opportunity to claim their share of 750 million ENA tokens, representing 5% of the total supply, based on their accumulated shards—a measure of their contribution to the Ethena ecosystem.



To ensure the longevity and sustainability of the ENA token distribution, a vesting schedule has been implemented particularly for the top 2000 wallets and holders of Pendle’s YT token. This vesting mechanism aims to give incentives to long-term participants of the Ethena ecosystem.



Furthermore, the ENA tokenomics outlines a distribution plan that allocates tokens to core contributors, investors, the foundation, and ecosystem development initiatives. These allocations reflect Ethena’s commitment to fostering growth, innovation, and community engagement within the DeFi space.



Ethena is about to begin its second season of the Shard Campaign, aptly named the Sats Campaign. This new campaign comes along with the protocol’s aim of Bitcoin as a backing asset.

Realio Network: the crypto RIO marks a +250% in 9 days

In recent days, the market’s attention has been drawn to the graphic performance of the Realio Network (RIO) crypto and the increasingly growing trend of the Real World Asset (RWA) sector.
RIO marks today its sixth consecutive green candle, standing at +250 since March 20th.
How far will this promising currency go?
Let’s see all the details below.

What is the RWA Realio Network project?
Realio Network is a SaaS (Software as a Service) platform that offers an integrated solution for issuance, investment, and management of the lifecycle of tokenized real-world assets, such as private equity, real estate, bonds, as well as for native digital assets such as cryptocurrencies.
The RWA project presents its own blockchain, built with Cosmos SDK, which serves as a layer for transactions within the Realio ecosystem.
At the center of the decentralized network is the RIO crypto, gas token that allows the user to facilitate a wide range of operations such as paying for requests for tokenization and participating in platform management.
Owners of RIO can take part in the governance of the project by voting on ecosystem upgrade proposals.
Distributed consensus is achieved with a native dual-token POS mechanism that uses RIO and another resource called RST.
There is also an L2 that reduces gas fees for more advanced DeFi services and for issuing digital tokens.
Among the various functions available in the app realio.fund, we also find the possibility to carry out decentralized swaps, cross-chain exchanges, delegation in governance processes, investments in various types of assets.

The goal of Realio is to offer advanced blockchain technology, capable of leveraging institutional quality investment opportunities in the world of real assets, while at the same time combining the advantages of decentralized finance and P2P exchanges.
The company managing the project was founded in 2018 in New York by Derek S. Boiron and Aaron Gooch, but currently all Limited companies are based in the Cayman Islands and the British Virgin Islands.
Despite this, it appears to be openly compliant with the standards established by the US SEC, and requires its users to undergo verification KYC during the registration phase.
Given the dominant trend of RWA in the crypto space, we will probably hear a lot more about this innovative project for a long time.
Think that even companies like BlackRock and Morgan Stanley are starting to invest in this sector.
.

Analysis of the prices of the crypto RIO: how far can it go?
The crypto RIO is attracting the attention of retail investors after the performances recorded in the market, where the currency RWA has exceeded the $3 threshold printing a +250% in the last 9 days of trading.
With the latest upward movement, RIO managed to surpass the peak of 2.78 dollars in May 2021, which marked the end of the bull market and the beginning of a long bearish phase that led the same coin to touch the bottom at 0.02 dollars in December 2022.
From that moment to today RIO is gaining an incredible amount of 13400%, surpassing any other result in the cryptocurrency market.

With a low emissions tokenomics of new tokens that stimulates speculation and a market capitalization still relatively low at 21 million dollars, RIO still has many growth opportunities ahead, but at the same time many challenges.
First of all, the RWA sector token needs to be listed on other major exchanges outside of OKX, which is the dominant market, HTX, MEXC and BINGX.
A listing on Binance, Bybit or Coinbase could definitely give an additional bullish push to the coin, which now has to face its price discovery phase.
Be careful not to be caught up in FOMO because the coin is now recording one of its highest RSI levels ever on the weekly chart, and it comes after two vertical green candles, which could pave the way for a slow distribution phase.
In the medium/long term, RIO can definitely be one of the most interesting horses, especially considering the growth prospects of the Real World Asset sector, and we could hypothesize at least reaching a market cap of 100 million dollars, which would translate into a coin price of 15 dollars.
However, the immaturity and youth of tokenization platforms, combined with the speculative nature of the crypto market, could highlight better in the future more established projects in this field such as Avalanche, Ondo and Chainlink, disadvantaging emerging platforms like Realio.

Coinbase CEO Explains Why They Got 'Huge Win' Against SEC


The CEO of Coinbase has shared an update on the company's ongoing legal fight with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. The court's latest decision has been described as a "huge win" for the future of self-custodial wallets and the blockchain ecosystem.The court ruled to proceed with most of the SEC's claims against Coinbase but, importantly, dismissed the claims aimed at Coinbase Wallet. This decision is seen as a victory for Coinbase and the crypto industry, emphasizing the importance of achieving clarity in the regulation of digital assets. The CEO expressed readiness to delve deeper into the SEC's internal perspectives on cryptocurrency regulation as the case progresses. Obtaining clarity from early court decisions, especially against government agencies, is close to impossible, but at the same time, it would make the life of companies operating in the industry much easier. This clarity is what Coinbase aims for.In light of this, the CEO urges Congress to push forward with legislation that supports digital asset innovation in the United States, emphasizing the need for the country to remain a hub for technological advancement.The court's recognition that innovations like the Coinbase Wallet do not fall under U.S. securities laws has been particularly welcomed by Coinbase. This acknowledgment supports the company's position that the technology driving cryptocurrency and self-custodial wallets should not be restricted by outdated rules.Practically, Coinbase and many other crypto-related companies want nothing but clarity from regulators and updated laws and rules. Additionally, Coinbase is trying to get official documents from the SEC that would clarify their stance on digital assets.

$0DOG prediction: Bitcoin Dogs sets a new tone amid robust use cases and BTC link - CoinJournal



                    

                    
Bitcoin Dogs token is set for listing as post-listing speculation gains mount.
Investors have been attracted by Bitcoin Dogs as the first ICO on the Bitcoin blockchain.
The token could rise to $1 amid speculation and use cases.

As Bitcoin Dogs ($0DOG) presale came to its ultimate halt on March 15, one thing was clear. The presale had exceeded expectations, raising nearly $13.5 million within a month. Investors were particularly interested in this token, being the first ICO on the Bitcoin blockchain. As such, predictions are rife that this token could surge strongly when it debuts on exchanges. Let’s dive in and explore the $0DOG potential as 100x predictions surface.
Bitcoin Dogs: A 100x potential token and the first Bitcoin ICO
As Bitcoin price hits levels about the 2021 record, attention has shifted to Bitcoin Dogs. Experts predict that as Bitcoin gains in value, Bitcoin Dogs will attract a positive sentiment. That’s partly because Bitcoin Dogs is the first-ever BRC-20 minted token. As such, investors looking for a share of the legacy Bitcoin network see Bitcoin Dogs as a sound alternative.
Being a Bitcoin-linked crypto token has won the hearts of Bitcoin Dogs backers. Bitcoin is the oldest blockchain and carries robust security features. This has allowed Bitcoin Dogs to ride the positive reception of Bitcoin and become a trailblazer in the presale. 
Besides, a lot of speculation remains in the crypto markets regarding Bitcoin developments in 2024. These include the approvals of the first spot Bitcoin ETFs earlier in the year and the halving event in April. The positive sentiment could flow into Bitcoin Dogs and help in its price discovery.
There is a lot to expect as Bitcoin Dogs eyes the next step in its budding life. That includes a listing on centralised exchanges (CEXs), scheduled for the first quarter. Owing to the strengths of Bitcoin Dogs in the presale, the listing will be met with a lot of token speculation. But Bitcoin Dogs has attracted attention with its exciting use cases. 
Biggest Bitcoin ordinals and Dogaverse experiences
Bitcoin Dogs spotlight seems to have also been inspired by its alluring NFT collection. This is a 10,000 unique and collectible tokens that would be available to $0DOG holders. And guess what? The collection will be the biggest Bitcoin ordinals NFT collection.
Users can curate and display their collectibles for sale within the Bitcoin Dogs NFT metaverse. Thanks to this feature, users have found a sound alternative to owning a piece of digital art. This comes even as Bitcoin NFTs gain popularity and Web 3.0 applications recover from the bear market lows. Bitcoin Dogs doesn’t stop there.
The platform features virtual interactions through its metaverse-themed Dogaverse. Fans are thrilled that virtual realities are fast gaining attention and Bitcoin Dogs is part of the transition. Once launched, $0DOG holders can immerse themselves in exciting experiences, opening up new opportunities. Fans can engage in dog training sessions, interact with fellow dog holders, and engage in competitions. As the metaverse ecosystem grows, the use case of $0DOG will be strengthened, boasting its price.
Bitcoin Dogs ($ODOG) prediction in 2024
A bullish crypto market, Bitcoin Dogs’ use cases, and its relationship to Bitcoin make the token attractive. This could allow $0DOG to surge wildly and claim a coveted 100x gain. Tokens that have attracted a lot of FOMO have risen and exceeded the margins in the past. 
With the presale’s starting price of $0.015, a possible 100x gain could see the token rise to above $1. Although speculative, favourable factors and investors buying the token on exchanges make the price realistic.
In the future, the price of Bitcoin Dogs will be pegged on its diverse use cases. The launch of the NFT marketplace and metaverse could see $ODOG deployed more in Web 3.0. Being the first Bitcoin ICO means Bitcoin Dogs will gain fast traction in the application areas. This will see the token continue increasing in value.

“While the macro outlook and timing of potential rate cuts remain uncertain, the upcoming halving event could add to the ETF tailwinds for bitcoin,” analysts led by Michael Graham wrote, adding that “for the rest of the ecosystem, activity levels continue to rebound from 2023 lows.” The quadrennial halving is when miner rewards are slashed by 50%, thereby reducing the supply of bitcoin. The next halving is expected in April. Canaccord says it is encouraged by the Securities and Exchange Commission’s (SEC) approval of 11 U.S. spot bitcoin ETFs in the quarter. “While bitcoin’s increase in value during Q1 was far greater than ETF inflows, this tailwind should persist as retail investors look to add crypto exposure to IRAs and other tax-advantaged accounts, and we expect spot ETFs could become a more meaningful part of bitcoin’s price action going forward,” the authors wrote. IRAs are a way of saving for retirement in the U.S.

Canadian authorities move to seize assets tied to QuadrigaCX CEO

The director of civil forfeiture in the Canadian province of British Columbia has made an unexplained wealth order to confiscate cash, 45 gold bars and luxury items found in a safe deposit box linked to a co-founder of the QuadrigaCX cryptocurrency exchange.An unexplained wealth order is a type of court order that compels a person to explain how they acquired their assets. Mike Farnworth, the province’s minister of public safety and solicitor general, said in a statement:“Through this action, we are demonstrating again that criminals will have to prove that their assets are the proceeds of lawful activity and not financial crime. The international, criminal actions of Quadriga Coin Exchange (Quadriga CX) led to thousands of people losing their life savings.”QuadrigaCX, once the largest cryptocurrency exchange in Canada, became insolvent in February 2019, shortly after its co-founder, Gerald Cotten, died in India, taking the private keys to QuadrigaCX’s offline storage systems to the grave.According to documents submitted to the British Columbia Supreme Court, the assets are allegedly the proceeds of criminal activities linked to Michael Patryn, co-founder of Quadriga Coin Exchange, and Gerald Cotten. The order facilitated the seizure of a safe deposit box at CIBC Bank along with an account. Related: QuadrigaCX creditors set to receive 13% of their claims as an ‘interim dividend’ Civil forfeiture has existed in British Columbia since 2006, allowing the province to confiscate property without criminal charges.Inside the safe deposit box were 250,200 Canadian dollars ($184,250) in cash, gold bars, two Rolex watches, a Chanel J12 Black Diamond watch and other jewelry items. Additionally, the box contained a 45-caliber Ruger 1911 pistol with ammunition and identity documents bearing the names Omar Dhanani and Omar Patryn, according to the CBC.The order contends that Patryn played a significant role in QuadrigaCX’s activities, including misappropriating customer funds and cryptocurrency, justifying the seizure of assets. Following the seizure, the next course of action is to prompt a response from Patryn to account for his wealth. After QuadrigaCX’s collapse, Patryn embarked on a new venture in decentralized finance, participating in various protocols like Wonderland and UwU Lend, using the alias “Sifu.” Michael Patryn was previously known as Omar Dhanani before two name changes in 2003 and 2008. He has been convicted of various financial crimes in the United States. Magazine: $3.4B of Bitcoin in a popcorn tin — The Silk Road hacker’s story

Bitwise CIO on the Future of Spot Bitcoin ETFs: Insights from a 20-Day Financial Odyssey | Cryptoglobe


                                
Matt Hougan is the Chief Investment Officer (CIO) at Bitwise Asset Management (aka “Bitwise Investments”). Hougan is well-regarded in the investment community for his deep expertise in exchange-traded funds (ETFs) and cryptocurrency. He has been a vocal advocate for the potential of cryptocurrencies to transform the financial industry, contributing to Bitwise’s mission of bridging the gap between traditional financial markets and the emerging crypto economy. 



On March 26, Hougan shared insights from his extensive 20-day journey across various financial circles. In a post on the social media platform X, Hougan conveyed his observations and predictions about the future of cryptocurrency investments, particularly focusing on spot Bitcoin ETFs, investor demand in different regions, and the shifting attitudes towards allocation percentages in investment portfolios.



Hougan expressed optimism about the sustained demand for spot Bitcoin ETFs, dismissing the notion that the remarkable inflows witnessed during the initial months were merely a temporary surge. His interactions with financial advisors and national account platforms revealed a significant disparity in the adoption pace of spot Bitcoin ETFs, indicating a long-term growth trajectory similar to that of gold ETFs but potentially unfolding over a shorter period. Hougan’s conviction is rooted in the understanding that a considerable segment of professional investors is yet to engage with spot Bitcoin ETFs, a situation he expects to evolve positively over the next two years as more due diligence processes are completed.







            
            

            
            

            
            

        

While in London for Blockworks’ Digital Asset Summit, Hougan noted a stark contrast in investor demand between the UK and the US, attributing the lag in the UK to more conservative regulatory stances towards cryptocurrencies. He mentioned that despite the vibrant developer and institutional trading communities in the UK, the end-investor demand remains in its infancy compared to the transformative impact ETFs have had in the US market. This observation led Hougan to reflect on the perceived progressiveness of US regulatory frameworks from the perspective of UK stakeholders eagerly eyeing advancements across the Atlantic.



Another significant shift highlighted by Hougan is the increase in the recommended allocation to Bitcoin within investment portfolios. Where a 1% allocation was the norm among professional investors discussing Bitcoin since 2018, Hougan has observed a paradigm shift towards a 3% or higher allocation. This change, he believes, is largely due to the introduction of spot Bitcoin ETFs, which have mitigated the perceived downside risk of Bitcoin investments, making higher allocations more palatable for investors.

QuadrigaCX Co-founder Faces “Unexplained Wealth” Case in Canada - DailyCoin


        
The QuadrigaCX crypto scandal continues.



The exchange’s surviving co-founder is facing a new court order.



The court order seeks to compel the co-founder to explain how he came by some seized assets.
Michael Patryn, a co-founder of defunct crypto exchange QuadrigaCX, is the target of an “unexplained wealth order” seeking to compel him to explain the source of funds used to obtain a cash hoard, gold bars, and luxury watches.Patryn is the surviving co-founder of QuadrigaCX, a trading platform that collapsed in 2019 due to a Ponzi scheme operated by its CEO and founder, Gerald Cotten. Cotten died unexpectedly in 2018 at the age of 30 while volunteering at an orphanage in India.British Columbia Authorities Target PatrynAccording to a Bloomberg report on March 28, the Director of Civil Forfeiture in British Columbia has sought a court order to force Patryn to explain how he came by over $600,000 in assets, which were seized by the Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) in June 2021.The assets in question include a cash hoard of C$250,200 ($184,250), 45 gold bars, two diamond-studded Rolex watches, Chanel J12 Black Diamond watches, and other jewelry. The assets were seized from a Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce safety deposit box in Vancouver, along with a 45-caliber Ruger 1911 pistol with ammunition.While Patryn’s lawyer had intimated in October last year that the seized assets weren’t linked to illegal activity, the co-founder must demonstrate that every item was legitimately acquired or risk forfeiting them.“Gold bars may be highly liquid and flashy luxury goods, such as jewelry and Rolex watches, attract attention, but they are also attracting the attention of police and our government. If they are the proceeds of criminal activity like fraud, drug trafficking or money laundering, we will go after them,” Mike Farnworth, Minister of Public Safety and Solicitor General, stated.Per Farnworth, if the assets are forfeited, their proceeds would be donated to crime victims and crime prevention services.

Solana Dominates Altcoin Market: Are ETH, ADA and LINK Bulls NGMI? - Coin Edition


							

Cardano bull Dan Gambardello addressed Solana’s bullish performance against ETH, ADA, and LINK.



SOL has seen over 850% gain in six months, while ETH, ADA, and LINK see less comparable gains.



Gambardello argued the altcoin season would commence after halving, and the game would change.




Solana (SOL) has been an extraordinary performer in the crypto scene for the past six months. Since last October, it has recorded over 850% gain, soaring from around $21 to above $200. Meanwhile, rivals such as Chainlink (LINK) gained about 200% during the same period. Ethereum (ETH) and Cardano (ADA) have witnessed gains exceeding 100%.



Notably, Solana’s astronomic gains took place before the Bitcoin’s halving, with the much-awaited altcoin season in the initial phase. This has led to concern about whether it’s game over for other top market contenders as Solana continues to dominate the spotlight among the most prominent cryptos.



Weighing in on this conversation is the popular Cardano bull Dan Gambardello. In a recent analysis, Gambardello attempted to clarify the performance of Ethereum, Cardano, and Chainlink in relation to Solana. 







Gambardello cited market data suggesting Solana is the only asset among the most valuable tokens outperforming Bitcoin. While he praised SOL, the analyst argued that the development is not unprecedented. 



On this premise, he recalled the price trajectory of Chainlink in the last bull cycle. Gambardello emphasized that LINK similarly experienced explosive gains of up to 1,000% gains pre-Bitcoin halving.



In contrast, contenders like ADA, SOL, and ETH did almost nothing while LINK mooned. Meanwhile, the analyst noted that Chainlink maintained its bullish momentum even after Bitcoin halved in 2020 but soon lost its steam. 



Essentially, Gambardello sought to emphasize that Solana’s lone bullish trajectory should not overly concern market participants to the extent that they believe other coins will never have their moment.  He stressed that the altcoin season is poised to commence after Bitcoin halves, and the game will really change.

Ethena prepares for governance token launch with a major airdrop

Alongside the significant move in the DeFi sector, Ethena, the protocol that governs USDe, a $1.3 billion token, will launch its ENA governance token soon. The most important action follows on April 2nd when the project enters its new phase, facilitating the release of 750 million ENA tokens, or 5% of the entire supply, distributed among the platform’s universe of users.Strengthening Ethena’s network through ENA airdrop initiativesThe protocol set down the entry procedure for the community members so they could partake in the airdrop while announcing that the engagement and commitment could help the platform grow. Those looking to earn the airdrop must work on their worthiness, shown in the number of shards they collected (shards contain one’s stake and involvement in the ecosystem). The cutoff for earning shards is set for April 1, with a clear guideline: If anyone in the community misses the date by unstaking, unlocking, or selling their USDe tokens before time fits, he/she will not be eligible for the AMAs. The distribution will be complete by listing ENA on well-established centralized exchanges, allowing new people to participate in the Ethena ecosystem.Revolutionizing yield generation with Ethena’s innovative token strategyOn top of that, 10% of the tokens are reserved for players and sold through airdrop, both a reward for current users and a lever allowing each of them to participate in Ethena‘s governance. Post-airdrop, the project is laying out a line of fresh incentives to keep the users hooked on the platform. Besides, the project aims to develop a stable ecosystem that is a real strength.The success and market value of Ethena, which are directly related to its creative technology idea for business-aimed token production, are proof of this. The USDe coin, sometimes called the “synthetic dollar,” opened up the option for steady yields by forcing liquid ether (ETH) staking tokens, including Lido’s stETH, to work as the backing assets. To create such a pair, we take a position worth long ETH perpetual futures of the same amount on the derivatives’ platform, trying to set a price at $1. Derivatives yield rates are examined via the “cash and carry” trade scheme.This business structure has exceeded the expectations of Ethena, starting with 85 million dollar value of USDe token on the first day of the year and then crossing the milestone of north of 1300 billion at the end of the year, which can be seen from the DefiLlama pricing. The swelling results from two factors: the possibility of wonderful profits prompted by the cryptocurrency interplay and the expectation of the ENA token airdropping, which is awaited.ENA token launch catalyzing growth and decentralization in Ethena’s futureAdding the ENA governance token to the Ethena community is significant for both Ethena and its participants. Through institutionalizing a governance architecture, the protocol is evolving to a more disintermediated and user-driven structure, in which token holders have a say and influence on the platform’s path and future. This move is twofold. First, by definition, Ethena agrees with decentralized finance, further consolidating its position in the competitive market.USA will focus on the token as a drive for expansion and enrichment and the governance structure to guarantee innovation, transparency, and good communal input. Smart contracts exploitation marketing campaigns are set to receive the intended spotlight from the existing DeFi contributors and new users, which will widen Ethena’s market hold in the blockchain sphere.Ethena’s ENA token distribution via an airdrop emphasizes the dedication to communal representation and decentralized handling of the network, which the protocol has shown. With more developed functionality and integration of these features, such as increased risk management, the platform positioned itself for the DeFi space, which will inevitably spur growth and innovation.

XRP price-to-sales ratio double that of Nvidia

The XRP token’s price-to-sales ratio is nearly double that of Nvidia, one of the most traded stocks on the market. The XRP (XRP) token has a price-to-sale ratio of 61.689, while Nvidia has a price-to-sales ratio of 37. This ratio is calculated by dividing a company’s market capitalization by the company’s revenue or total sales over the past 12 months. The lower the ratio, the more attractive the investment.Ripple’s XRP ledger generated over $583,000 worth of network fees in 2023, according to Messari. In comparison, Nvidia generated $26.97 billion in revenue during 2023, according to its 2023 fiscal report.The XRP token rose 0.15% in the 24 hours up to 10:30 am UTC, to $0.6205, with a $34 billion market capitalization, according to CoinMarketCap data.Nvidia shares were down 0.49% in pre-market trading to $898.25, according to Yahoo Finance data.Nvidia is the world’s largest semiconductor chip manufacturer and the third-largest company in the world, with a market capitalization of $2.25 trillion. The firm reported a 265% year-on-year increase in revenue amid rising global demand for artificial intelligence (AI) equipment.The XRP price rose 20.55% over the past year, while Nvidia’s share price rose over 241%, mainly driven by increased global demand for semiconductor chips widely used for high-level AI models.

DeFi Saver integrates Safe to bring account abstraction to DeFi | Cryptopolitan

Delaware, USA, March 28th, 2024, ChainwireIn a move to greatly improve the user experience of DeFi users in the Ethereum ecosystem, DeFi Saver integrated native support for Safe smart accounts and multisigs.DeFi Saver, one of the leading apps for creating, tracking, and managing DeFi positions on Ethereum just announced they’ve integrated account abstraction leader Safe, to take the experience of DeFi users to the next level. This comes on the back of Safe’s recently announced milestone of more than $100 billion in digital assets secured on Safe smart accounts, with more than 40 million transactions conducted on Safe infrastructure.The update means that DeFi users of protocols such as Aave, Compound, Morpho Blue, Spark, CurveUSD and Liquity will be able to manage their positions more efficiently, through use of options that bundle or batch multiple actions into one single transaction using the power of the Safe smart accounts. This includes features such as leveraging up or unwinding in one transaction, doing collateral and debt swaps, moving whole active positions between different protocols, various automation features, but also even simpler things such as depositing collateral and borrowing funds in one, single transaction. All of this results in unnecessary steps being abstracted away from DeFi users and traders.Besides all the advanced features that are made possible through use of a smart account, this update also allows DeFi users to greatly increase their security through the use of Safe multisigs, which are the security standard for asset ownership. Starting today, all current and new users can enjoy native multisig support at DeFi Saver moving forward.Another important aspect for both teams is the composability and portability that users will enjoy. Since Safe is widely supported in DeFi apps and frontends, this means that all DeFi Saver users will be able to check and manage their positions through other apps. And, vice versa, all existing Safe users can now seamlessly connect to the DeFi Saver app and make use of the plethora of tools available.“We believe that composability and portability are some of the greatest, most important aspects of DeFi and yet this primitive is being ignored by many teams opting to build small, proprietary, walled garden systems. That’s why we chose Safe and intend to keep building on the open, permissionless building blocks.” said Nenad Palinkasevic, the co-founder of DeFi Saver.Lukas Schor, co-founder at Safe, commented, “Smart Accounts are critical infrastructure and we think that for DeFi mass adoption, we need the security of smart accounts, but also the UX benefits to already integrate within the top DeFi projects today. We welcome this move by DeFi Saver to accelerate the transition to smart accounts and Safe ecosystem.”  Moving forward, the teams also highlighted that this change will allow great improvements to the user experience in DeFi through continued batching of multiple actions into single transactions, but also through features such as sign-only modes where all transactions would be handled for the users in the background, providing a quicker and smoother experience.About DeFi SaverDeFi Saver is a management application for decentralized finance protocols best known for their advanced leverage management features and automated liquidation protection options. Having initially started as a MakerDAO-focused dapp in the early days of DeFi, they quickly expanded support to more protocols, as well as multiple L2 networks.

Ripple Vs. SEC Saga: Legal Expert Unravels The "Bigger Argument" | Bitcoinist.com


								Former founder and chairman of Murphy and McGonigle law firm James A. Murphy, also known as MetaLawMan, has delved into the legal battle between Ripple Labs and the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), offering his perspective on the bigger argument in the case.
Bigger Argument Within The Ripple Vs. SEC Case
James Murphy revealed his insights on the legal dispute in an interview with Scott Melker on the Wolf where he examined the SEC’s damages theory in the case. According to Murphy, Ripple recently had a very lucky break, which he perceives as the bigger argument in the court case.

He then drew attention to a previous ruling by the Second Circuit Court of Appeals, which states that the SEC must prove misconduct by naming actual money-losing victims or something identified as pecuniary harm in order for there to be a disgorgement.
He stated:
The Second Circuit Court of Appeals ruled at the end of last year that in order for there to be a disgorgement, there have to be victims of the frauds, victims of the securities law violation. There has to be something called the pecuniary harm that means actual losses.
However, applying this statement to the SEC’s filing on the damages theory, Murphy asserted that a piece of the filing mentioned the presence of pecuniary harm in XRP sales, but they do not correspond to a single purchase of XRP.
Generally, the SEC’s lawsuit is predicated on the notion that certain buyers of XRP were adversely affected financially because they purchased the product at a lower price than others. 
Consequently, it would be difficult for the court to demonstrate that the proposed $850 million punishment is appropriate in the absence of actual harm evidence. Considering the nature of the case, Murphy believes that the aforementioned figure will be significantly lower when punishment is finally established.
Addressing the concept of disgorgement, Murphy emphasized that in the absence of identifiable victims, the disgorgement that seeks to reimburse those harmed for illegitimate profits becomes unsustainable.
Therefore, there is no $200 million interest since interest triggers a disgorgement. Nonetheless, it is still possible to have a penalty in the absence of victims and disgorgement judgment.
$2 Billion Fine Request By The SEC
It is noteworthy that the SEC has filed a motion asking US Judge Torres Analisa to grant its requested fine of about $2 billion from Ripple as its final judgment against the payment firm.

The regulatory watchdog is requesting $1,950,768,364 in total from Ripple. Specifically, the grant would propel Ripple to pay $876,308,712 in disgorgement and demand a civil penalty of $876,308,712 and prejudgment interest of $198,150,940. 
So far, Ripple Chief Executive Officer (CEO) Brad Garlinghouse has criticized the agency regarding the move. Garlinghouse slammed the SEC, saying that this had never been done before and that he and the firm would keep exposing the Commission to what it is when they respond to the motion.

YouTuber Logan Paul argues CryptoZoo ‘isn’t a scam’ in new documentary

YouTuber Logan Paul has argued that his infamous CryptoZoo project, which resulted in many investors losing money, was not a scam.In a new documentary, 5 Months with Logan Paul, journalist Graham Bensinger sat down with Paul to get his side of the story on the CryptoZoo nonfungible token (NFT) gaming project. The duo spoke about the many allegations hurled at the internet celebrity, with Bensinger reiterating the point that the exposure brought by Paul “led people to lose money.” Logan Paul answering questions about CryptoZoo. Source: YouTubePaul admitted that there’s an element of truth to the statement. However, the YouTuber argued it was not a scam. Paul added: “Everything you just said has an element of truth to it. Here’s the problem. What you just described isn’t a scam. I took on a project that I was simply incapable of handling at the time.”Paul argued that he also lost money in the project, seemingly implying he was also a victim. “I didn’t make any fucking money, bro. I’ve lost half a million dollars on this. Where is the scam?”The YouTuber also said in the documentary that he’s had suicidal thoughts because of the CryptoZoo project. “For the first time in my life, I was having suicidal thoughts. I was just spiraling,” he said. Related: YouTuber KSI faces pump-and-dump allegations from ZachXBT and CoffeezillaApart from attempts to counter allegations, Paul also said in the documentary that he’s going to “take care” of the people who made CryptoZoo look like it was a scam perpetuated by him. He said: “The CryptoZoo saga is far from over because it was a one-sided story. He [Coffeezilla] told it how he wanted to tell it and told it a certain way that made me look like the captain of the ship.”This isn't the first time Paul has promised to act against those who have reported about CryptoZoo. In January 2023, Paul threatened to take legal action against YouTube journalist Stephen Findeisen — also known as Coffeezilla — after Findeisen published a piece on the project. However, Paul quickly backtracked on the threats and apologized to Findeisen days later. In the same month, Paul unveiled a $1.5 million recovery plan for those affected by the failed project. However, it took a year and a class-action lawsuit before the buyback plan was implemented. In February 2023, disgruntled investors filed a class-action lawsuit against CryptoZoo and Paul, alleging that the venture performed a rug pull. The plaintiffs alleged that Paul and the project stole millions of dollars through the venture. Source: NAWOT On Jan. 5, Paul announced that the buyback program would begin. However, it included a catch: Users could only get a refund if they waived any current or future claims against the YouTuber.Magazine: ‘Am I sorry?

XRP and XLM about to ‘melt faces;’ Here’s why


With the optimistic sentiment still ruling the cryptocurrency sector, crypto technical analysts have observed that the chart patterns of some of its assets are displaying signs of possible ‘face-melting’ rallies in the near future, in particular those of XRP and Stellar lumens (XLM).
As it happens, pseudonymous crypto market analyst Charting Guy has recently pointed out that the “2 coins that have traded sideways or as some say, ‘done nothing’ for 6 years” would “melt faces very soon,” as he explained in an X thread published on March 27.
Indeed, the expert stressed that both “have been consolidating with higher lows, but also lower highs,” forming a symmetrical triangle pattern, which are the “biggest ones I’ve ever seen and their apexes are rather close,” citing his colleague Coins Kid who said that “compression leads to expansion.”


XRP price prediction
Specifically, Charting Guy noted that XRP, the token at the center of the court standoff between the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and blockchain company Ripple, was targeting an area between $10 and $13, as its symmetrical triangle casually aligned with the top of the observed channel.

As a reminder, the XRP price at press time stands at a mere $0.6198, down 0.01% on the day, gaining 0.01% across the week, and advancing 5.46% in the last month, which means it could soon grow its price between an immense 1,513.42% and 1,997.45%, should the crypto analyst’s predictions prove correct.

XLM price prediction
At the same time, Charting Guy highlighted that XLM was making the same pattern, emphasizing the fact that “these 2 charts are almost identical and they have a very high correlation in price movement,” which could lead Stellar lumens toward hitting the price in the $2.50 zone.

Currently, XLM is changing hands at the price of $0.1367, recording an increase of 0.54% in the last 24 hours, adding 3.47% to its value across the previous seven days, and growing 13.74% on its monthly chart. Should the expert’s prognoses materialize, it could further gain 1,728.42%.

Finally, as Charting Guy concluded in response to potential critics of his theory:

“i don’t think you all understand the [total addressable market (TAM)] of XRP & XLM. these coins will run the new financial system as a neutral bridge currencies that connect [central bank digital currencies (CBDCs)]. f*ck trillions. we’re talking QUADRILLIONS of dollars.”

Meanwhile, Coins Kid, the pseudonymous crypto market specialist and a staunch believer in XRP’s future quoted by Charting Guy, shared these remarks on his own X profile, commenting in agreement that the “time in the market beats timing the market,” as he said on March 27.
Ultimately, time will tell whether the above predictions come true, but it is important to remember that trends in this industry could easily change, so doing one’s own research and reading up on XLM and XRP news is critical before investing in these assets.

Dogecoin Jumps 10% to Clear $0.20 for First Time Since 2021 - Decrypt

Dog-themed meme crypto Dogecoin has surged by 10% in the past day, reclaiming $0.20 for the first time since December 2021.Dogecoin is currently priced at $0.2038, up 10.8% on the day and 34.6% on the week, per data from CoinGecko. The cryptocurrency last hit $0.20 on December 4, 2021, according to the crypto price tracker. It remains a far cry from its all-time high price of $0.73, posted in May of that year at the height of the crypto bull market.The meme coin's price bump comes days after Twitter's artificial intelligence chatbot Grok told some users that Dogecoin payments on the platform were possible—likely as the result of an AI hallucination, since no such functionality has been enabled.In a Twitter thread, Dogecoin developer Mishaboar speculated that Twitter crypto payments could be implemented "much earlier" than a five year horizon, albeit "probably not sooner than next year," arguing that payment services such as PayPal already support crypto.Elon Musk, Twitter payments and DogecoinTwitter owner and chariman Elon Musk has previously revealed his intention to turn the platform (rebranded as X) into a "super app" with payment capabilities, with an official @XPayments account launching earlier this year.However, although Musk has long professed to be a fan of Dogecoin, the tech billionaire has not confirmed that the meme coin (or, indeed, any cryptocurrency) would form part of any planned payments feature.He has previously speculated that Dogecoin could be used as a means of payment for the social media platform's premium subscription service Twitter Blue, and has collaborated in the past with Dogecoin developers.Last year, the Financial Times reported that Musk wanted Twitter's planned payment service to be primarily based around fiat currency, but with the option of adding crypto functionality "at a later point," according to sources familiar with the matter.Edited by Stacy Elliott.Stay on top of crypto news, get daily updates in your inbox.

Over $1B in U.S. Treasuries (UST) Has Been Tokenized on Public Blockchains

The rapid rise in Treasury yields in the past two years has fueled demand for their tokenized versions. The 10-year yield, the so-called risk-free rate, has risen to 4.22% from 1.69% since March 2022, denting the appeal of lending and borrowing the dollar-pegged stablecoins in the decentralized finance market.

BlackRock: approval of the Ethereum ETF is possible

Yesterday, the founder and CEO of BlackRock, Larry Fink, stated that he believes it is possible to launch an ETF on Ethereum spot even if the SEC manages to declare ETH a security. 
He stated this during a live appearance on Fox Business.


BlackRock’s Ethereum ETF
BlackRock has not only launched on the US stock exchanges what is set to become the world’s largest Bitcoin ETF, but a few months ago it also filed a request with the SEC to launch an ETF on Ethereum spot.
Although BlackRock has a approval rating of over 99% for its ETF issuance requests, doubts are circulating about whether the SEC will approve it. 

The problem is that the SEC considers ETH an unregistered security, and therefore traded on US markets illegally. 
However, it is not the government agency that can decide whether an asset should be considered a security or not, so much so that a court last year ruled against the SEC itself, which claimed that XRP should be considered a security. 
Actually, the issue on XRP does not seem to be completely closed yet, both because XRP has been declared not to be an investment contract if purchased on the secondary market, but nothing has been decided yet for sales on the primary market, and because the lawsuit against Ripple is not yet over. Furthermore, in other similar cases, other judges have ruled differently.
However, so far no judge has yet expressed an opinion on whether ETH should be considered a commodity like Bitcoin, or an unregistered security.
ETH as security
The issue with securities is that in the USA they can only be legally sold after receiving approval from the SEC. 
ETH has not yet received this approval, also because it has never been requested. 
Until last year it was believed that Ethereum was a commodity like Bitcoin, but the switch to Proof-of-Stake with the introduction of staking has questioned this definition.
It is possible to imagine that in order to reach a final judgment from a judge, which is the only way to do it, the SEC will first have to reject the requests for the issuance of ETFs on ETH spot in the USA, leading to a court appeal by the applicants. 
For Bitcoin, on the other hand, something similar happened, because despite being clearly a commodity, the SEC initially rejected requests for the issuance of spot BTC ETFs in the USA. 
At that point Grayscale sued the SEC, and a judge ruled in favor of Grayscale and against the SEC, paving the way for the subsequent approval. 
By the end of May, the EC will necessarily have to pronounce itself on the requests for the issuance of ETFs on ETH spot, and at this point it seems likely that it will opt for an initial rejection, pending a subsequent explicit pronouncement by a court that clarifies the nature of ETH as a commodity or security. 
The role of BlackRock in approving the Ethereum ETF
It is worth noting that the situation regarding Bitcoin spot ETFs began to unlock as early as June of last year, just when BlackRock submitted its request. In fact, it was known that its approval rate for ETFs was over 99%. 
Later, the court ruled in favor of Grayscale at the end of August, finally resolving the issue. 
So yesterday’s words from Larry Fink seem like a way to anticipate the SEC’s moves.
In other words, it’s as if they stated that their request to issue an ETF on ETH spot on US exchanges will proceed even if the SEC refuses to approve it, using the excuse of considering ETH an unregistered security. 
Moreover, surely even in BlackRock they know very well that the SEC, in the midst of the electoral campaign for the November presidential elections, could opt for a rejection in May, but they also know perfectly well that the issue would only be resolved in front of a judge at that point. 
BlackRock has now thrown itself headlong into the crypto sector, even launching a tokenized fund on Ethereum.
It should not be forgotten that this is a real giant, a global giant that manages over $10 trillion in assets, making it the world’s largest asset manager. 
The price of Ethereum
In fact, the price of ETH, the native cryptocurrency of the Ethereum ecosystem, has not been particularly affected by the assumption that the SEC will likely reject the ETFs in May.
Shortly after mid-October, the price of ETH entered a bullrun phase, ending on March 13th. 
The price went from less than $1,700 to over $2,400 by the end of 2023, then rose to $2,700 in January 2024, and later to almost $4,100 on March 12. 
This is a remarkable -150% in less than five months, although there was a correction afterwards that brought it back to $3,000.
Currently it has risen to over $3,500, which is a value 115% higher than before the bullrun started. 
Interestingly, however, it has not yet managed to update the highs of 2021, when it reached nearly $4,900. On the other hand, the TFs are pushing mainly Bitcoin, and it will probably take a while before they can also push ETH.

BTC Whales Sell to TradFi; Analyst Predicts Price to Reach $77K


							

Old Bitcoin whales’ are selling to new institutional players, reshaping market dynamics.



Bitcoin may surge 10% to $77K if it holds above the $70K threshold.



BTC’s 24-hour trading volume has spiked by 25%, reaching $42.392 billion.




The market activity of Bitcoin has drawn attention as the changes in ownership patterns have become evident. On-chain data reveals that old established Bitcoin holders, known as ‘old whales,’ are transferring their Bitcoins to new institutional investors, implying a shift in market dynamics.



Notably, this movement of Bitcoin is happening between these large-scale holders, known as ‘whales,’ and not spreading widely among retail investors. On the same accord, a chart from analyst Axel Adler Jr., shared by Ki Young Ju, CEO of CryptoQuant, captures the shifting dynamics between investor classes. 







The chart specifically compares the supply and demand trends of new versus established Bitcoin investors over an extended period. This distinction between new and established investors is crucial, as it highlights the growing interest from traditional financial institutions in the crypto space.



Simultaneously, technical analysis from other sources, such as Ali Martinez, suggests that Bitcoin is on the verge of a bullish breakout. Observations of a ‘bull flag’ pattern on the 4-hour chart hint at a possible significant price surge. 







Based on this outlook, if Bitcoin’s price holds above the $70K level, it could experience an increase of around 10%, reaching a new all-time high of $77K. In tandem with the positive outlook for crypto, Bitcoin has gained a 1.23% rise during the previous 24-hour period.







BTC/USD 24-Hour Chart (Source: CoinMarketCap)



As of press time, Bitcoin’s price has reached $70.62K. This upswing comes despite the coin experiencing some volatility earlier in the week. Alongside the rise in its price, Bitcoin’s market capitalization has climbed by 1.32%, reaching a notable $1.389 billion. 



Complementing these gains, there has been a significant uptick in activity, as reflected by the 25.02% increase in intraday trading volume, which has surged to $42.392 billion, signaling heightened investor interest and market movement.

Indonesia to implement regulatory sandbox for crypto assets

The Indonesian Financial Services Authority (OJK) said that local financial services institutions offering new products and services must be included in the regulatory sandbox or leave room for testing upcoming innovations, including crypto asset products. According to a report by local Indonesian media outlet DetikFinance, once regulated and supervised, crypto assets will also need to go through a regulatory sandbox in the future. This means crypto firms in the sandbox stage will have to be evaluated by the regulator before being approved to operate in the country. Regulatory sandboxes are typically tools for businesses to test and experiment with new innovative products or services for a limited period.  Hasan Fawzi, the head of the country’s supervision of the financial sector technology innovation, digital financial assets and crypto assets, said that crypto assets have been included in the regulatory sandbox in an effort to eradicate fraudulent investments.  “I think this is our spirit at OJK, especially in consumer protection and education. We really hope that all of our regulatory mechanisms will be present and have a direct impact on preventing fraudulent investments.”Related: SBI expands Ripple remittance tech to banks in Vietnam, Indonesia, PhilippinesAs a part of this announcement, the OJK will take over regulation of the crypto industry starting in January 2025. Currently, it is under the jurisdiction of the country’s commodities agency, known as Bappebti. Indonesia classifies crypto assets as commodities, though when moved to OJK’s governance, it is speculated that they may be reconsidered as financial instruments. The crypto landscape in Indonesia has been heating up over the last year, with a pro-crypto candidate elected vice president in the most recent presidential elections. During his election campaign, Gibran Rakabuming Raka vowed to prepare blockchain, crypto, artificial intelligence (AI) and cybersecurity experts that would encourage local youth in the digital space.In 2023, the country launched its landmark national crypto exchange — the Indonesian Crypto Asset Futures Exchange — monitored by local regulators. It serves as the country’s sole platform for the legal exchange of digital assets. It has also begun conducting blockchain trials in public services. Earlier in March, Indonesian officials were reportedly considering changes to its dual taxation on crypto, urging a reevaluation of the country’s current 0.1% capital gains tax and 0.11% VAT on crypto transactions.Magazine: Owner of seven-trait CryptoPunk Seedphrase partners with Sotheby’s: NFT Collector

As Bitcoin (BTC) Halving Approaches, Analysts Shared Their Expectations! Here are the Details - Bitcoin Sistemi


As Bitcoin continues to attract the attention of investors worldwide, a new report from broker Canaccord Genuity highlights the potential for further bullish momentum in the cryptocurrency market following the upcoming halving event.
Canaccord Report Says Bitcoin Halving Could Boost ETF Momentum
According to the report released today, history suggests that an increase in Bitcoin and crypto market activity may be on the horizon in the months following the halving.


Canaccord analysts led by Michael Graham attribute the over 60% rise in Bitcoin (BTC) in the first quarter to several key factors, including the approval of spot exchange-traded funds (ETFs), the upcoming reward halving, and increased risk appetite in financial markets.
“While the macro outlook and timing of potential interest rate cuts remain uncertain, the upcoming halving event could contribute to significant upside for Bitcoin,” the report states.






Canaccord highlights the importance of the halving, which occurs approximately every four years and involves reducing miner rewards by 50%, thus reducing the Bitcoin supply. The next halving is expected to occur on April 21.
On the other hand, the report underlines that it is a positive development that the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) approved 11 US spot Bitcoin ETFs in the first quarter.


Canaccord predicts that this approval will continue to gain momentum, especially as individual investors look to add cryptocurrency exposure to Individual Retirement Accounts (IRAs) and other tax-advantaged accounts.

KuCoin Stays True to Its Motto “The People’s Exchange” With $10M Airdrop Compensation - Coin Edition


							

KuCoin CEO announced that the exchange will be airdropping $10M in BTC and KCS



FUD caused users to withdraw more than $1 billion from KuCoin



Lyu stated that KuCoin stayed loyal to its motto the “People’s Exchange”




CEO of KuCoin Exchange Johnny Lyu announced that KuCoin will be air-dropping $10 Million worth of KCS and BTC. In Lyu’s words: “To express our profound gratitude for your support and patience, KuCoin will launch a special airdrop event totaling 10 million USD in KCS and BTC”



In particular, this announcement comes after KuCoin was slapped with allegations from both the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission(CFTC). 



With the allegation against KuCoin, fear, uncertainty, and doubt (FUD) took the better of many users and as a result, KuCoin saw around $1 billion in crypto being withdrawn, causing a 20% drop in assets under management.



Addressing the issue and thanking the loyal users, the CEO of KuCoin stated in a blog post on their official website:




I would like to express my gratitude to all KuCoin users, for your support, trust, and companionship during the past few days, as well as the past 7 years. We will absolutely ensure the security of user assets as always and comply with regulations to fulfill our trust.,




Reflecting on compensation that KuCoin made in the past, Lyu stated, “In the early days of October 2017, at the very early stage of KuCoin, we made the unprecedented decision in the industry to proactively acquire and compensate users in large amounts due to the abnormal delisting of the CFD project.”



He further stated that this act of proactive compensation marked the origin of the title of “People’s Exchange” – a testament to the community’s original affirmation of KuCoin. He mentioned that they have always treasured this rare trust, and being “People’s Exchange” was their proudest label.



However, airdrops have their own set of problems. One of these problems is the threat of regulatory consequences.



The SEC, in its “Framework for ‘Investment Contract’ Analysis of Digital Assets,” stated: Just because digital assets are received for free, for example, being put into an “airdrop,” does not mean the investment of money requirement of the Howey test is not met; therefore, an airdrop can be considered a sale or distribution of securities.

Cardano architect slams ‘zombie blockchain’ allegations


Not long after an article came out describing multiple blockchains, including Cardano (ADA), Tezos (XTZ), Litecoin (LTC), Algorand (ALGO), Monero (XMR), Ripple, and others, as “zombies” with “few users,” Cardano founder Charles Hoskinson clapped back in his own style – with humor.
Apparently, an investigation by Forbes staff revealed that about 50 cryptocurrency platforms are “today trading at values of more than $1 billion, of which at least 20 are functional zombies,” according to the article that the popular media outlet published on March 27.
What did the report say?
Indeed, the report has slammed these blockchains and their crypto assets as “useless,” “good-for-nothing,” and with “little utility other than for speculative crypto trading,” boasting “treasuries brimming with millions” and answering “to neither shareholders nor regulators.”


In particular, Forbes writers had especially vicious criticism aimed at Cardano, which they argued had “brought in $3 million in fees last year, despite the Cardano Foundation itself saying it hasn’t yet completed its developmental stages,” as well as its founder, saying that:

“Hoskinson himself seems to be the main attraction. He owns an 11,000-acre ranch in Wyoming, funds self-described alien hunters and recently opened an anti-aging and regenerative medicine center in the town of Gillette. (…) He claimed to have dropped out of a math Ph.D. program (…), but the school says Hoskinson was an undergrad who didn’t complete his degree.”

Charles Hoskinson’s witty response
In response, Charles Hoskinson posted an animation featuring zombies from the hit series South Park, mentioning the other platforms called out in the article, including Bitcoin Cash (BCH), Stellar (XLM), and Ethereum Classic (ETC), saying Forbes was calling them zombies “because we got all the brains!”

As a reminder, this isn’t the first time that the media has accused Cardano of being dead, irrelevant, or failing, which its founder pointed out in August last year, sending a message to all the nay-sayers that “Cardano is here to stay,” as Finbold reported back on August 15, 2023.
In fact, the declarations of death have happened many times even to the crypto market representative and flagship decentralized finance (DeFi) asset Bitcoin (BTC), specifically 476 times since 2010, including as recently as February 2024, according to the data retrieved from 99Bitcoins.
Ultimately, the modern blockchain industry will unavoidably have plenty of critics, whether with well-founded or misplaced criticism, but also supporters who, nonetheless, should approach this market with caution and do careful research, including keeping up with Cardano news, before investing.

Fantom: Market Slowdown Chops off 10% From Gains, Here's Why


                            Leading the downturn today, Fantom (FTM) contributes to the 2% drop in the crypto market after weeks of growth.

Fantom is one of those altcoins that followed the broader momentum of the market. The latest market data shows that the token is down 10% in the past 24 hours, but is still on the green in the bi-weekly timeframe at 14%. However, Fantom has a trick up its sleeve to curb this brewing bearishness potentially. 
Fantom CEO Michael Kong Unveils Sonic Launch 
Sonic is the brand-new technology that the Fantom has been developing in the past 2 years. According to their latest blog post, Sonic was able to surpass the network’s 200 transactions per second metric. Although 200 TPS was already impressive compared to Ethereum’s 12 TPS, the network was quickly congested, and user experience deteriorated. 
Kong said in the blog post: 

“​​Sonic will be used to create a new best-in-class shared sequencer for L1 and L2 chains, capable of processing over 180 million daily transactions with real, sub-second confirmation times, and serve as the foundation to relaunch Fantom as an entirely new community-centric brand.” 

This brand-new tech will cover all parts of the Fantom network, from bridging to a stablecoin launch, Sonic has it all. 
Sonic Labs will also gain a slice of the pie as the foundation ultimately adds grant programs alongside the network upgrades. 

Bitcoin is now trading at $70.396. Chart: TradingView
“We will continue to significantly scale and accelerate our Sonic Labs grant program for developers who build unique and valuable applications and public goods in categories including gaming, DeFi, social media, streaming, and now distributed AI,” Kong added. 
This will significantly increase the size of Fantom’s user base, boosting investor confidence, and giving more room for developers to innovate. 
Furthermore, the advancements brought forth by Sonic Labs in covering all aspects of the Fantom network, from bridging to the launch of a stablecoin, are poised to have a notable impact on Fantom’s market dynamics.
By streamlining processes, enhancing interoperability, and introducing new functionalities, these developments are likely to enhance the network’s attractiveness to investors and users alike.


The Fantom Foundation X account announced today that Frax Finance Founder Sam Kazemain is the first angel investor for Sonic, stating that Frax will deploy natively issued assets on Sonic on its eventual launch.
Short-Term Gains Slashed In Favor Of The Long-Term
Meanwhile, the bears have completely taken over the FTM market in the short to medium term. Investors in FTM could only hope that the broader market downturn will reverse in the coming weeks.

Prisma Finance exploited in $10 million breach

Crypto Remains Under-regulated, FATF Chief Warns | Coinspeaker



Data detailed in a statistics report shows that less than 30% of jurisdictions globally have implemented the FATF crypto-targeted guidelines.

The Financial Action Task Force (FATF) has highlighted the need for comprehensive regulation in the crypto space. The message was conveyed in a recent interview granted by the FATF President T. Raja Kumar.
According to Kumar, the rallying call comes as a result of recent research into how global jurisdictions are responding to FATF’s recommendations for crypto regulation.




Data detailed in a statistics report shows that less than 30% of jurisdictions globally have implemented the FATF crypto-targeted guidelines. Essentially, this means that a significant portion of the crypto market continues to operate without oversight.
The report is named “Status of Implementation of Recommendation 15 by FATF Members and Jurisdictions with Materially Important VASP Activity”. FATF’s recommendation charges jurisdictions to clamp down on the criminal uses of crypto by licensing virtual asset service providers (VASPs). The agency also urges every jurisdiction to do a review of their business practices, products and technology.
As of publication, jurisdictions including Italy, France, and many more across Europe have aligned with FATF’s dictates. Although the recommendations are not mandatory, non-abiding jurisdictions face the potential risk of being isolated globally.
FATF Chief Sounds Alarm on Inadequate Crypto Regulation
Kumar spoke about the far-reaching implications of the lack of comprehensive regulation in the industry. Although he acknowledges the rapid growth and widespread adoption of cryptocurrencies globally, Kumar also noted that insufficient regulatory oversight creates grounds for risks, while also threatening the integrity of the financial system.
Interestingly, the negative effects of an unregulated crypto space do not end with investors alone. Law enforcement agencies also face challenges in combating illicit activities such as money laundering, terrorist financing, and fraud, which are often associated with cryptocurrencies. That is not to mention the constant uncertainty and hindrance to growth that legitimate crypto-based businesses may also experience as a result of unclear regulations.
The warning issued by the FATF chief underscores the urgent need for enhanced regulatory oversight in the crypto space. But more importantly, it also highlights the need for cooperation and cross-coordination among every stakeholder.
As cryptocurrencies continue to gain mainstream acceptance and adoption, regulatory authorities must prioritize the development of clear and comprehensive regulations. That is to ensure that the integrity of the financial system is kept intact while investors and consumers are also fully protected.
Looking forward, effective regulation will do two things for the crypto industry. Firstly, it will mitigate the risks that are linked with cryptocurrencies. It will also foster greater trust and confidence in the market, thereby encouraging responsible innovation and sustainable growth.

Let's talk Sam Bankman-Fried: What to expect from his sentencing | Cryptopolitan

Sam Bankman-Fried, the ex-FTX CEO, is on the edge of his seat as March 28 approaches. That’s the day he finds out if he’s walking free or starting a long stint in prison after being found guilty of seven serious crimes. Judge Lewis Kaplan of the New York Southern District is the man of the hour, listening to the last pleas for and against Bankman-Fried. This courtroom drama started with FTX’s crash in 2022 and followed with Bankman-Fried’s arrest, extradition, trial, and conviction.The Sentence DebateIn November 2023, a jury nailed Bankman-Fried for wire fraud, securities fraud, commodities fraud, and money laundering. His lawyers, hitting the ground running, asked for a 6.5-year jail time, arguing that the mess he caused only temporarily locked FTX investors out of their money.The prosecution, on the other hand, is pushing for 40 to 50 years, emphasizing the gravity of Bankman-Fried’s actions. The legal tussle focuses on how much money was actually lost when FTX went under, a key factor in deciding the sentence length.Legal eagle Mark Bini predicts a 30-year sentence, maybe even longer, considering the heated debate over the losses incurred. There’s a proposed plan to refund FTX users in cash, based on November 2022 crypto prices, but that means they’d miss out on any recent spikes in Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies’ values.An FTX user shared the devastation of losing their funds, highlighting the real-life impact of Bankman-Fried’s decisions. This case is charting new territory in dealing with high-profile digital asset figures facing trial and sentencing, with comparisons drawn to other notable cases like Ross Ulbricht of Silk Road and Elizabeth Holmes of Theranos.Comparing CasesBankman-Fried’s legal saga might not affect Changpeng “CZ” Zhao’s upcoming sentencing for a different type of crime at Binance, but Alex Mashinsky’s trial could feel some ripples, given the shared defense team and similar New York venue.As D-Day looms, there’s no word if Bankman-Fried’s family will be there to support him. The judge will weigh various factors, including the nature of his offenses and the financial damage inflicted on FTX’s customers and investors.The collapse of Bankman-Fried’s crypto exchange left an $8 billion hole and led to his conviction on several counts of fraud and money laundering. Despite the dire situation, FTX’s bankruptcy process has hinted at a possible full repayment to customers.Bankman-Fried’s defense argues that the financial harm to those involved is nil, attributing the $8 billion gap to a liquidity crisis amid a customer withdrawal frenzy. Moreover, ongoing restructuring talks suggest FTX could repay its customers significantly more than their initial claims, thanks to a rebound in crypto and AI asset values.Prosecutors dismiss these claims, highlighting that many customers won’t recover the real value of their deposits, as some cryptocurrencies have vanished. They also point out the enduring financial and emotional toll on FTX users, emphasizing that any future repayments won’t undo the immediate harm caused.Investors like Sequoia Capital are also staring down substantial losses, with their stakes now worth zilch. The final outcome depends on resolving claims and finalizing the bankruptcy plan, but Bankman-Fried’s actions have left a mark that won’t easily be erased.Legal experts are skeptical of Bankman-Fried’s defense swaying Judge Kaplan, noting the jury’s rejection of similar arguments. While some investors might have been more crypto-savvy, the notion that Bankman-Fried isn’t directly making victims whole is a sticking point.

Biden administration takes action to safeguard public from AI risks

The White House has unveiled its inaugural comprehensive policy for managing the risks associated with artificial intelligence (AI), mandating that agencies intensify reporting on AI utilization and tackle potential risks posed by the technology.According to a March 28 White House memorandum, federal agencies must, within 60 days, appoint a chief AI officer, disclose AI usage and integrate protective measures. This directive aligns with United States President Joe Biden’s executive order on AI from October 2023. On a teleconference with reporters, Vice President Kamala Harris said: “I believe that all leaders from governments, civil society and the private sector have a moral, ethical and societal duty to make sure that artificial intelligence is adopted and advanced in a way that protects the public from potential harm while ensuring everyone can enjoy its full benefits.”The latest regulation, an initiative by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB), aims to guide the entire federal government in safely and efficiently utilizing artificial intelligence amid its rapid expansion. While the government seeks to harness AI’s potential, the Biden administration remains cautious of its evolving risks.As stated in the memo, certain AI use cases, particularly those within the Department of Defense, will not be mandated for disclosure in the inventory, as their sharing would contradict existing laws and government-wide policies. By Dec. 1, agencies must establish specific safeguards for AI applications that could affect the rights or safety of Americans. For instance, travelers should have the option to opt out of facial recognition technology used by the Transportation Security Administration at airports.Related: Biden administration announces key AI actions after executive orderAgencies unable to implement these safeguards must discontinue using the AI system unless agency leadership can justify how doing otherwise would heighten risks to safety or rights or hinder critical agency operations.The OMB’s recent AI directives align with the Biden administration’s blueprint for an “AI Bill of Rights” from October 2022 and the National Institute of Standards and Technology’s AI Risk Management Framework from January 2023. These initiatives emphasize the importance of creating reliable AI systems.The OMB also seeks input on enforcing compliance and best practices among government contractors supplying technology. It intends to ensure alignment between agencies’ AI contracts and its policy later in 2024.The administration also unveiled its intention to recruit 100 AI professionals into the government by the summer, as outlined in the October executive order’s “talent surge.”Magazine: Real AI use cases in crypto: Crypto-based AI markets, and AI financial analysis

BlackRock CEO’s ETF comments boosts Ethereum (ETH) and Algotech (ALGT)



                    

                    
BlackRock CEO Larry Fink believes a spot Ethereum ETF is possible even if SEC designates ETH a security.
Markets are upbeat amid this outlook despite current weakness.
Meanwhile, investors eyeing new gems have identified new token Algotech (ALGT).

BlackRock CEO Larry Fink has noted his bullish stance on Bitcoin, with the global asset management behemoth seeing massive uptake for its iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) spot Bitcoin ETF. Fink is also optimistic about a spot Ethereum ETF.
What does this mean for Ethereum price? Elsewhere, why is the new decentralized trading platform Algotech (ALGT) attracting so many investors to its presale?
Larry Fink on potential spot ETH ETF
In comments on Wednesday, BlackRock CEO Larry Fink said that designating ETH a security won’t be “deleterious”, noting that an ETH ETF was still possible.
Various analysts have noted that a spot Ethereum ETF nod from the SEC is unlikely in May. 
However, Fink’s comments align with the broader anticipation that this will eventually get an approval. As such, the BlackRock CEO’s remarks saw a slight flip for Ethereum and other altcoins late Wednesday.
Ethereum price rose slightly to above $3,658. However, it remains choppy amid recent news around the Ethereum Foundation.
The outlook was similar across the altcoin market, except for Dogecoin and Bitcoin Cash.
DOGE and BCH were seeing double-digit gains, perhaps helped by the anticipated Coinbase listing of Dogecoin and Bitcoin Cash futures trading on April 1, 2024. 
Crypto traders are eyeing the futures listing. Interest in new crypto project Algotech is also rising.
Why is Algotech (ALGT) attracting investors?
The crypto world offers multiple opportunities, particularly in the trading space. However, many people around the world are unable to tap into this due to various reasons. One of these is the complexity of the trading market.
Algotech is a new trading platform that seeks to level the playing field, tapping into AI and machine learning to open up opportunities for everyone.
The algorithmic crypto trading platforms offer intelligent trading strategies. The AI-powered platform removes the limitations associated with manual trading, including limited analytics, inconsistency in execution and human emotions and biases.
All these factors make crypto trading on traditional platforms largely unappealing for the ordinary user. Algorithmic platforms change this.
Advanced algorithms allow for real-time access and analysis of markets, datasets and trends. Leveraging the automated platform means users can make informed decisions related to the opportunities available.
With Algotech, users will tap into speed and efficiency, data-driven decision-making and real-time market data. It’s one platform likely to change the crypto trading landscape big time.
Should you buy ALGT today?
The token powering the Algotech ecosystem is ALGT.
According to the Algotech whitepaper, the total supply of ALGT is 350 million. 70% of this is available in presale. The project has raised over $3.3 million from early investors so far, with more than 84.9 million tokens sold.
For a project likely to dominate given its robust technical infrastructure, tokenomics, roadmap and future dominance, the sub-cent presale prices might offer a great entry point.
Currently, the presale is in stage 2, which is 92% sold out with ALGT price at $0.06. Presale participants can access a 20% promotion bonus on all deposits in this stage. Meanwhile, the next stage will see ALGT price rise to $0.08.

Hashing It Out: Can blockchain create a sovereign internet?

A week after experiencing an internet blackout in his country, Hashing It Out host Elisha Owusu Akyaw looks for answers on how blockchain technology can create a more sovereign internet in an interview with the co-founder of XYO Network, Arie Trouw. The episode also covers data sovereignty and the importance of privacy in the ever-evolving internet landscape. The conversation between Owusu Akyaw and Trouw explores new issues like elections and fake news, and how blockchain tech could be used to verify the authenticity of information on social media. Trouw explains that the sovereign internet is based on that idea of the original version of the internet (Web1) but with the functionalities of Web2 and Web3. On a sovereign internet, users own their own data set, tools and services, which they can share with other users without needing a central server or third-party authority. “So the sovereign internet is really, to some degree, a step back from Web2 to Web1, where each party has their own services and their own peer-to-peer functionality that they share with somebody else. And the internet works the way it’s meant to be, where it’s resilient to outages.” With major elections taking place worldwide in 2024, issues like fake news and artificial intelligence-generated deep fakes threaten to widen the polarization in society.Trouw concedes that blockchain may not be the answer to the problem since dealing with fake information on the internet requires the average person to be a skeptic and have the desire to verify everything they read. However, when society develops a culture that seeks to verify the credibility of information, Trouw believes that blockchain technology would be the ultimate method to authenticate the origin of information on the internet. The rest of the podcast explores more use cases of blockchain technology in creating a better internet by using location data and how blockchain technology could play a role in identifying aliens.

                        Western Europe has emerged as a leading region in global crypto adoption, attracting a substantial number of daily traders, ranging from 1.2 million to 1.5 million individuals.According to a new research from Bitget, Germany and France are at the forefront of activity in the region, while Austria has experienced the most significant yearly growth, witnessing a remarkable 70% surge in users. Germany closely followed with a 69% increase, while other Western European countries demonstrated slower growth rates ranging between 15% and 20%.When compared to other regions, Western Europe benefits from a clearer level of compliance, the report said. Countries such as Germany, Switzerland, Belgium, France, Austria, Liechtenstein, Luxembourg, and the Netherlands adhere to the legislative framework established by the European Union for regulating crypto assets.Spot Trading Dominates Trading in Western Europe
Centralized exchanges and spot trading dominate the cryptocurrency trading landscape in Western Europe. Users in Germany, Switzerland, and the Netherlands exhibit a preference for trading futures, while other countries lean towards spot trading.Centralized exchanges attract the majority of daily traders, with centralized exchange (CEX) traffic surpassing decentralized exchange (DEX) traffic by a factor of 10. Among those opting for decentralized platforms, PancakeSwap and Uniswap emerge as the most popular exchanges. Coinbase Wallet, Metamask, Bitget Wallet, and TrustWallet are the preferred cryptocurrency wallets across the eight countries.Over the past year, centralized exchange traffic from Western European users has experienced significant growth, particularly in Germany, Switzerland, and Poland. Germany and Switzerland saw a year-over-year increase of over 50%, while Poland witnessed a growth rate of 145%. However, France and Belgium exhibited slower growth rates, with Belgium even experiencing a 6.8% decline compared to the same period last year.DeFi Accounts for Majority of Crypto Activity in Western Europe
Decentralized finance (DeFi) usage constitutes the majority of cryptocurrency activity in Western Europe, while peer-to-peer (P2P) trading volumes remain relatively low. The prevalence of purchasing digital assets using fiat deposits or linked cards contributes to the limited adoption of crypto P2P trading in the region. In contrast, regions like Southeast Asia rely more on P2P transfers as the primary instrument for cryptocurrency trading.Regarding asset choices and trending topics, Western European traders actively participate in decentralized projects, show familiarity with DEX tools and trading, engage with NFTs and Web3 platforms, and demonstrate interest in popular chain ecosystems like Solana. Emerging cryptocurrencies such as Ordinals, NFTs, RWAs, DePin, Solana ecosystem tokens, and meme coins have gained significant attention among traders in Western Europe throughout the year.“The Bitget research suggests that cryptocurrency participants in the region typically possess a high level of education, exercise caution, and prioritize long-term investments,” the report wrote. “Additionally, a significant portion of local users actively engage in both online and offline forums, including community Ask Me Anything (AMAs), where they exchange market insights and discuss industry trends.”Another recent survey has revealed that nearly 50% of European cryptocurrency holders owned Bitcoin in February.

ONDO, MKR are 'profitable' - These numbers will tell you why - AMBCrypto



ONDO’s price surged as interest in the Real World Asset sector grew.
MakerDAO continued to dominate the space, with the highest TVL accrued.

Ondo Finanace [ONDO] has seen a massive uptick in price over the last week, largely owing to the behavior of whales concerning this token. However, new data suggested that this uptick could be part of a larger trend.
Welcome to the Real World
The sudden interest in ONDO could be driven by the interest in the RWA (Real World Asset) sector. For context, the RWA sector in crypto stands for Real World Asset tokenization. It bridges the gap between traditional finance and crypto by creating digital tokens representing real-world assets like real estate, commodities, or even intellectual property.
This allows these assets to be bought, sold, and traded on a blockchain platform, potentially increasing their liquidity and accessibility for investors. It’s seen as a way to modernize traditional financial markets by leveraging the transparency and efficiency of blockchain technology.
Ondo Finance has emerged as the fourth-largest holder of Blackrock’s Ethereum-based tokenized fund, BUIDL, boasting holdings totaling $15 million.
Thanks to the endeavors of ONDO and similar protocols, the total tokenized US Treasuries on public blockchains have reached $1 billion. Within a mere week, Blackrock’s BUIDL saw an astonishing surge of 400%, skyrocketing from a supply of 40 million to 240 million.

Don’t forget about Maker
Apart from Ondo Finance, other networks such as MakerDAO[MKR] have also been showing large amounts of growth. At press time, MakerDAO had the largest amount of TVL (Total Value Locked) collected on its network.
It was the leader in the space and despite the protocol’s considerable resources, the price of the MKR token had declined by 7.28% over the past month.
Source: DeFi Llama
Due to the vast difference between the value collected by RWA protocols and their market cap, market speculators believe that these tokens may be undervalued.

Realistic or not, here’s MKR’s market cap in BTC’s terms

At press time ONDO was trading at $0.9011 and its price had grown by 0.84% in the last 24 hours. MKR on the other hand was trading at $3,353.13 and its price had grown by 3.64%  during the same period.
Most of the holders of these tokens were profitable as suggested by their high MVRV ratios. Only time will tell whether these addresses will sell their holdings or continue to hold them going forward.

Ethereum Network Hits Record High of 1 Million Validators with $114B Staked | Coinspeaker



Ethereum now has more than 1 million validators, with more than 26% of Ether’s total supply currently staked in pools.

The number of validators on the Ethereum network has hit 1 million, a new high for the blockchain. In total, the validators have staked 32 million Ether, worth around $114 billion at current market prices.
According to data from Dune Analytics on Thursday, the validator count is exactly 1,002,400, with precisely 32,076,797 ETH staked. This translates to 26.74% of the entire ETH supply.




Lido Has the Highest Number of Validators
The Dune Analytics dashboard also displays further information, including showing Lido as the Ethereum staking pool with the highest volume of staked tokens, at 30%, with more than 9.6 million ETH staked, and 302,000 validators. Coinbase is in the second position with 14%, 4.5 ETH and 141,000 validators, while Binance is the third-largest but well below Coinbase. Binance has 39,000 validators who have staked 1.24 million ETH, 3.9% of the total supply.
Validators are necessary for the function of proof-of-stake (PoS) blockchains. Essentially, they validate transactions, create new blocks, and are responsible for network security and consensus. Each validator must stake a minimum of 32 ETH. Unsurprisingly, Lido has the largest market share because it allows users to participate collectively instead of each one single-handedly meeting the 32 ETH minimum.
Ideally, the number of validators suggests an increase in blockchain security. However, venture investor and former Ethereum Chief Decentralization Officer, Evan Van Ness believes that there is “already too much staked”.
Last September, Ethereum developers decided to change a Dencun upgrade code relating to validator set size growth. They considered this necessary because over time, there have been issues and warnings about the effect of a large volume of the validator set size. For instance, when developers were testing the Holesky testnet, they discovered that at 2.1 million active validators, the testnet could not finalize.
According to Ethereum Foundation DevOps Engineer Parithosh Jayanthi, network attestations were between 40% and 50% even when block proposals hit 80%. Jayanthi said attestations only grew to the 82% to 84% range when developers reduced the testnet size from 2.1 million to 1.4 million.
Restaking Spikes Volume of New Ethereum Validators
Last month, the number of validators on queue hit 7,045, the highest since October 6. At the time, the backlog was for 225,000 ETH, about $562 million. The backlog resulted from Ethereum’s restriction of the number of validators allowed to join the network per epoch – the block creation duration, which is about 6.4 minutes. The number on the queue later increased to 9,000.
The large number of validators on the queue may be because of restaking, which allows staking already-staked ETH to boost rewards. The staked ETH in one pool, like Lido, can be restaked on another platform for additional yield.
While staking increases network security, concerns about validator control were recently raised after a large number of validators made a heavy ETH withdrawal amounting to about $320 million.

Crypto Influencer EmperorBTC Advises Followers To Buy The Dip If Bitcoin Dumps To $65K Again - What Are Analysts Saying? - Benzinga

With nearly 400,000 followers on X, crypto influencer EmperorBTC has achieved success by offering market insights and Bitcoin (BTC) trading analysis to his community. EmperorBTC is one of many influencers on X who continually post content about Bitcoin's future. While there are some valuable insights, some of the content can be directed at an echo chamber of Bitcoin bulls. For this reason, it's important to consider many different analysts' opinions on Bitcoin. Don't Miss:Take a look at what EmperorBTC has been saying about Bitcoin. The influencer recently posted on X:1. If Bitcoin Dumps to $65K again, it will be time to buy the dip even harder. Buy everything you have belief in.2. The halving is not priced in. No one is giving it enough attention. It’s automatically bullish.3. It’s time to deploy your time, sleep and capital season.The controversial point in the post comes from the halving. There is lots of debate around whether the event is priced in, meaning that the price of Bitcoin already reflects the known impacts of the halving. There are reasonable arguments on both sides. JPMorgan Chase & Co. analysts believe the halving is already priced in, saying that BTC could go as low as $42,000. "This $42,000 estimate is also the level we envisage bitcoin prices drifting towards once bitcoin-halving-induced euphoria subsides after April," JPMorgan analysts wrote. They also mention that the halving will lower mining profitability, which could have negative effects on Bitcoin's price. On the other side of the debate, analysts see Bitcoin continuing to rise in 2024. Fundstrat's Tom Lee said that Bitcoin will reach "$150,000 before year end … and much much higher numbers in the future." Lee has experience with financial markets and crypto, so this prediction carries some weight.Additionally, Standard Chartered is also bullish on the token, projecting it to reach $100,000 by the end of 2024 and $200,000 by the end of 2025. Both Standard Chartered and Lee believe that the halving will reduce selling pressure and allow the price of Bitcoin to surge.The halving will reduce the number of new Bitcoins minted each day from around 900 to 450. Some miners take these newly minted tokens and sell them each day, which can help keep prices lower. With fewer tokens, there could theoretically be less selling activity. JPMorgan and others see the situation differently. They believe that the halving is already priced in or that it will lead to a large selloff. This would lead Bitcoin's price to either trade sideways or fall after the halving. EmperorBTC's opinion is that the halving will be positive for BTC. If he is correct, now would be one of the last times to get into an investment for a solid price. If he is wrong, an investment in BTC right now could fare poorly. Bitcoin is extremely unpredictable, especially with the novelty of current market dynamics.Read Next:

Veteran Bitcoin Whales' On-chain Antics Spark Intrigue - Who's Gaining?

CryptoQuant CEO Ki Young Ju highlights an intriguing Bitcoin trend spotted via on-chain data: old whales are selling Bitcoin to new whales (TradFi), not retail investors.Veteran Bitcoin whales, referring to early adopters with vast quantities of the currency, are beginning to sell off their holdings. But contrary to what one might expect, it is not the retail investors who are the primary beneficiaries of this sell-off. Instead, a new class of whales has emerged from the traditional finance sector (TradFi), and they are the ones scooping up the Bitcoin being shed by the old guard. One of the classic patterns observed during Bitcoin bull markets is a transfer of wealth from old to young. Investors who accumulated BTC at lower prices several months or years ago prefer to increase their distribution pressure as new ATHs are reached.Julio Moreno, CryptoQuant's head of research, reported an incident along these lines that saw an early BTC miner, probably from the Satoshi era, shift 2,000 BTC. Moreno added that these coins were mined in 2010 and were all transferred to a single address that was newly created.Similarly, CryptoQuant noted in a recent analysis, referencing Bitcoin Realized Cap Hold Waves, that in recent months, short-term Bitcoin holders have accumulated significant amounts of Bitcoin. Based on this metric, short-term holders now account for 50% of the realized Bitcoin cap.Shift in dominanceBitcoin reached an all-time high of $73,750 on March 14. At the time of writing, BTC had risen 1.17% in the previous 24 hours to $70613, down 4.29% from its recent all-time highs.According to on-chain analytics firm Glassnode, a market rally to new all-time highs coincides with a shift in dominance, in which funds held by new investors and speculators surpass those held by longer-term HODLers.As Bitcoin reached its ATH, Glassnode reports that $2.6 billion in realized profit were locked in through on-chain spending. Nearly 40% of this profit-taking can be attributed to the long-term holders, which include investors divesting from the GBTC Trust.

QuadrigaCX Co-Founder Grilled by British Columbia Authorities, Here's Why



Records submitted to the British Columbia Supreme Court indicate that Michael Patryn is suspected of having obtained the assets illegally. 

The British Columbia (BC) government recently filed an unexplained court order, seeking to seize assets belonging to Michael Patryn, co-founder of the defunct crypto exchange QuadrigaCX.
Authorities Move to Seize QuadrigaCX Co-Founder’s Assets
The director of Civil Forfeiture in B.C. explained in a report that the seizure targets a quarter-million dollars in cash, 45 gold bars, luxury watches, and jewelry contained in a safety deposit box belonging to the co-founder.




Records submitted to the British Columbia Supreme Court indicate that Michael Patryn, who was once involved with Gerald Cotten in establishing QuadrigaCX, is suspected of having obtained the assets illegally.
B.C. Solicitor General, Mike Farnworth highlighted that the recent move by B.C. authorities is the third instance that an unexplained wealth order has been issued in British Columbia since amendments were made to the Civil Forfeiture Act. Simply explained, unexplained wealth orders require individuals to explain the origins of their wealth and assets, especially where criminal conduct is suspected.
“Through this action, we are demonstrating again that criminals will have to prove that their assets are the proceeds of lawful activity and not financial crime,” Farnworth explained.
After Cotten’s unexplained death in India in 2018, the exchange, which had millions of investor funds under management, experienced turmoil. His passing accelerated the discovery of almost $215 million in missing investor funds, causing QuadrigaCX to file for bankruptcy under a court order in 2019. A subsequent investigation conducted by the Ontario Securities Commission later ruled that QuadrigaCX was not merely a failed business venture but a fraud and Ponzi scheme.
In June 2021, authorities seized a safety deposit box linked to Michael Patryn at a Vancouver-based CIBC branch. Among the items seized were $250,200 in Canadian currency,  luxury timepieces, 45 gold bars from Australia and Canada, a variety of jewelry, and numerous identity documents linked to different aliases.
It is estimated that QuadrigaCX defrauded approximately 76,000 customers. The exchange’s bankruptcy trustee, Ernst & Young (EY), was only able to collect $46 million of the $215 million owed to investors. Last year, a law firm representing users of the defunct crypto exchange said it would begin an interim distribution of cash related to the trading platform’s bankruptcy proceedings.
Implications of Civil Forfeiture to QuadrigaCX
Civil forfeiture, a legal procedure in place in British Columbia since 2006, allows the province to recover assets without filing criminal charges. This option allows police to dismantle criminal enterprises and recover proceeds from illicit activity.
In the instance of QuadrigaCX, where thousands of investors were left in financial ruin, seeking justice through civil forfeiture is viewed as a critical step in dealing with the consequences of the fraudulent operation. The QuadrigaCX case serves as a reminder of the dangers of unlicensed cryptocurrency exchanges and the necessity of strict regulation in the nascent field of digital assets.

Quantum Computing Firm D-Wave Quantum Inc. (QBTS) Reports Mixed Q4 Results - Tokenist


					
Neither the author, Tim Fries, nor this website, The Tokenist, provide financial advice. Please consult our website policy prior to making financial decisions.



D-Wave Quantum Inc. (NYSE: QBTS), a trailblazer in commercial quantum computing systems, software, and services, recently unveiled its financial achievements for the fourth quarter and the conclusion of the fiscal year 2023.



The company’s CEO, Dr. Alan Baratz, heralded this period as a testament to D-Wave’s undeniable momentum, underscored by remarkable commercial traction, significant product advancements, and the establishment of pivotal strategic partnerships.According to Dr. Baratz, these accomplishments are steering D-Wave to fortify its standing as the pioneering force and commercial leader in quantum computing.



D-Wave Reports $2.9 Million in Q4 Earnings, Up 21% Year-Over-Year



The financial highlights for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2023 reflect D-Wave’s success. The company reported a 21% year-over-year increase in revenue, amounting to $2.9 million, marking the third consecutive quarter of sequential growth. Bookings for the same period exhibited a 34% rise from the previous year, totaling $3.1 million and representing the company’s seventh consecutive quarter of year-over-year growth in this metric. Moreover, D-Wave’s gross profit surged by 45% to $2.0 million, and its GAAP gross margin expanded significantly to 67.7%, both indicators of the company’s robust financial health and operational efficiency.





D-Wave Misses on Revenue Expectations in Q4



When juxtaposed with market expectations, D-Wave’s fiscal achievements underscore the company’s capacity to outperform and drive growth. Analysts had projected an earnings per share (EPS) of -$0.11 and revenue of $4.69 million for the quarter. Although D-Wave’s revenue fell short of these projections, its EPS of -$0.10 per share reflected a narrower loss than anticipated, demonstrating the company’s improving profitability trajectory.



The company’s effective management of operating expenses, which decreased 17% year over year, along with a notable advancement in adjusted EBITDA, further illustrates D-Wave’s adeptness at surpassing expectations through strategic financial stewardship.



D-Wave Expects $4.3 Million in Bookings for Fiscal Q1



Looking ahead, D-Wave has set ambitious targets for the first quarter of fiscal 2024, aiming for at least $4.3 million in bookings. This goal signifies a minimum of 36% growth over the fourth quarter of fiscal 2023 and a 47% increase from the first quarter of the previous fiscal year, signaling the company’s eighth consecutive quarter of year-over-year growth in quarterly bookings. D-Wave’s projection for the full fiscal year 2024 anticipates an Adjusted EBITDA Loss of $54.3 million, less than the fiscal 2023 Adjusted EBITDA Loss of $54.3 million, highlighting the company’s ongoing efforts to refine its profitability and operational efficiency.

BlackRock CEO Remains Confident on Ethereum ETFs, Says IBIT Is The Fastest-Growing ETF


																In a recent interview on FOX Business, BlackRock CEO Larry Fink shared his insights on the potential for an Ethereum exchange-traded fund (ETF) amidst regulatory scrutiny.
Despite concerns over a possible designation of Ethereum as a security by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), Fink expressed confidence in the feasibility of launching such an ETF.
SEC’s Stance on Ethereum Raises Doubts
BlackRock and several other ETF providers have submitted applications for a spot Ethereum ETF to the SEC. However, there are doubts regarding the agency’s approval of these ETFs as the May deadline approaches.
When asked about the SEC’s stance on ETH possibly being classified as a security, Fink refrained from providing detailed commentary but remained optimistic. “But I don’t think that designation is going to be too deleterious,” Fink stated, suggesting that such a designation wouldn’t necessarily hinder the creation of spot Ethereum ETFs.
It was recently disclosed that the SEC is exploring the classification of Ethereum as a security and has issued subpoenas to three companies for details regarding the Ethereum Foundation, a Swiss nonprofit important to the growth and advancement of the blockchain. This development has raised concerns about the possibility of launching an Ethereum ETF in the United States.




On the other hand, analysts in the field are sharing differing opinions. Bloomberg’s ETF experts James Seyffart and Eric Balchunas have voiced doubts, pointing to the SEC’s minimal interaction with filings as worrisome. However, Craig Salm has countered this argument, suggesting that the SEC’s lack of engagement shouldn’t necessarily signal the approval outcome.
Fink Bullish on Bitcoin
Despite these challenges, Fink remains optimistic about Ethereum’s and Bitcoin’s long-term prospects. BlackRock is not only pursuing an Ethereum ETF but also operates one of the most successful spot Bitcoin funds, the iShares Bitcoin Fund (IBIT), which has amassed over $17 billion in assets under management since its approval in January.


IBIT is the “fastest-growing ETF in the history of ETFs,” Fink stated on Fox Business. He also said he is “very bullish on the long-term viability of Bitcoin. We’re creating now a market that has more liquidity, more transparency, and I’m pleasantly surprised and would have never predicted it before we filed it that we were going to see this type of retail demand,” he added.

                        SHIB has gained by 5% in the past 24 hours, as the Shiba Inu price moves to $0.00003204 on a quiet day for the crypto market as a whole.This moves means that SHIB has recorded an 18% return in a week and a 205% increase in the last 30 days, with the meme token’s trading volume rising beyond $1.5 billion today.Such a volume indicates a spike in demand for SHIB, potentially coming from whales who expect the token to rally further in the coming weeks.And with the market enjoying a lift in recent days, today could be the beginning of a productive period for Shiba Inu.Shiba Inu Price Prediction as $1.5 Billion Trading Volume Floods In – Are Whales Buying?
SHIB’s chart looks pretty bullish today, with the coin showing plenty of momentum that could continue for another one or two days yet.Its relative strength index (purple) has jumped to 70 in the past hour, rising from under 50 yesterday.Source: TradingViewThis signals a big shift in buying pressure, which also finds reflection in SHIB’s 30-day average (orange), which has begun rising again in the last few hours.What’s also promising is that Shiba Inu’s resistance (red) and support (green) levels have been rising in parallel this week, suggesting that the coin’s price will occupy an increasingly high range in the near term.On top of this, SHIB’s 24-hour trading volume has increased by around 125% since Monday, rising from $700 million to about $1.7 billion.Again, this shows that whales may be moving to SHIB in the expectation that the meme token has some substantial gains to make in the coming weeks and months.And given that SHIB is still some 62% down from its current ATH ($0.00008616), it has plenty of room for big gains.Such gains could come as the wider market gains speed, with analysts expecting prices to rise as we move towards next month’s Bitcoin halving.The market is also likely to become increasingly bullish in response to expected Federal Reserve rate cuts, which will increase investor appetite for risk-on assets such as cryptocurrencies.This includes Shiba Inu, which remains one of the strongest meme tokens in the market in terms of its fundamentals.The Shiba Inu price could therefore reach $0.00004 in the next few weeks, before making a climb towards $0.00005 and higher by the summer.New Meme Tokens Bring Greater Volatility
The only issue with SHIB is that, as a well-established meme coin, the days of its astronomical gains are most likely over.Traders wanting exponential returns will therefore have to look elsewhere, with several newer meme coins looking like they could fill the void.A good case in point is Slothana (SLOTH), a Solana-based meme token that has raised just over $1.2 million in its presale.This figure is highly impressive in light of the fact that it opened its sale only a few days ago, and it provides an indication of how popular SLOTH is becoming among investors.It has styled its memes after the lovable sloth, a representation of how it expects to make traders big profits with a minimum of effort.Its launch comes at a time when demand for Solana-based meme coins has been sky-high.For example, the recently listed Pundu raised just over $100 million in its presale, while DogWifHat has gained by just over 200,000% since listing in December.SLOTH is clearly trying to tap into such a market, and while it’s still very, its ability to raise over $1 million in just a couple of days is a very good sign.VIDEOInvestors can get involved in its presale by going to its official website, with the coin available at a price of 1 SOL for 10,000 SLOTH (or roughly $0.019393 per coin).It’s also worth pointing out that its team was also responsible for Smog (SMOG), which rallied enviably earlier this year after listing.SLOTH may therefore replicate such performance, making its early investors a sizeable profit.Visit Slothana Now

Final Bitcoin Options Expiry Before Halving Is Here-What You Need to Know - Decrypt

Approximately $15 billion worth of Bitcoin open interest contracts expire tomorrow—the last monthly expiry ahead of the next BTC halving—across derivatives exchanges CME, Derebit, OKX, Binance and Bybit, according to CoinGlass.For Derebit, this March 29 expiry accounts for roughly 40% the $26.3 billion worth of total Bitcoin open interest on the platform—"one of the biggest in Derebit's history," the exchange said on Twitter.The groundswell of institutional interest and deepening liquidity signaled by current open interest can't be overstated. Ahead of the last Bitcoin halving, which occurred on May 11, 2020, open interest had only reached $2 billion.Now, ahead of the 2024 halving, the BTC market is seeing unprecedented levels of open interest in options and futures. This hints at a highly sophisticated and liquid market. Institutional participation has grown, helped massively by the introduction of spot Bitcoin ETFs in January. The anticipation surrounding the halving and its potential impact on supply and price dynamics is more pronounced than ever.Open interest is a measure of the nominal value of derivatives contracts, like futures and option. Traders use them to bet on the future price movements of an asset, like BTC and stocks, or commodities, like grains and gas.And the swell of open interest points to crypto traders feeling especially bullish during these final weeks ahead of the next Bitcoin halving, which currently looks to be taking place in 23 days on Saturday, April 20.After every 210,000 blocks have been processed on the Bitcoin network, the reward paid to miners is cut in half—which is where the Bitcoin halving name comes from. It's an anti-inflation measure that increases the scarcity of BTC roughly every four years and usually also kicks off a price rally.But it hasn't always been easy to gauge how traders are feeling about the halving with open interest. The first Bitcoin futures platform, ICBIT, emerged in 2011, but didn't attract much market attention. So when the first Bitcoin halving occurred on November 28, 2012, BTC was still very much an experimental technology with a small investor base.By the time the second halving occurred on July 9, 2016, the Bitcoin ecosystem had evolved. BitMEX had started offering BTC derivatives in 2014 and introduced perpetual swaps in 2016. And not long after, traditional finance mainstays CBOE and CME began offering Bitcoin derivatives in December 2017—marking the first time crypto derivatives were being traded on U.S. regulated exchanges.The CBOE and CME entry came at an especially significant time in the market. The 2017 bull run had just taken BTC on a ride from $1,000 in January to $20,000 in December.But when the third halving occurred on May 11, 2020, investors were still in the grips of a global pandemic that seemed to underscore Bitcoin's appeal as "digital gold." This was the first time that substantial open interest in Bitcoin futures and options signaled deepening market liquidity and a broader investor base. Institutional interest had started to pick up as the Bitcoin market capitalization exceeded $1 trillion for the first time.Even so, the current open interest is seven times larger than the $2 billion worth of open contracts ahead of the 2020 Bitcoin halving.Stay on top of crypto news, get daily updates in your inbox.

Data shared by the @spotonchain analytics X/Twitter account shows that a smart whale has sold a large Ethereum chunk. It included a lot of dormant ETH coins acquired when the second largest cryptocurrency traded below the $700 zone.Dormant ETH coins bring whale $10 million in profitThe tweet reveals that this whale (wallet ending in 0xf2b) has dumped all of his Ethereum – 17,768 ETH, selling it for 62.24 million DAI. The aforementioned amount of Ethereum is equal to a massive $63,655,281 in fiat. That is a ROI of more than 400%, the tweet states. @spotonchain also revealed that a lot of the coins sold by this whale were purchased by him from centralized exchanges Gemini and Bittrex between 2018 and 2021, when ETH traded approximately at $679 – an estimated cost of almost $10 million.Debates about Ethereum ETF continueRecently, Bloomberg’s ETF analyst Eric Balchunas stated that the odds of the SEC greenlighting spot Ethereum ETFs have plunged to merely 25% and became less likely, taking a pessimistic turn.There is less than a month now before the deadline for VanEck’s ETF application arrives but, according to the aforementioned Bloomberg expert, there are hardly any communications between the regulator and ETF issuers who have filed their applications, BlackRock among them. Another reason for believing in a great delay on Ethereum ETF approvals is the fact that getting a green light for spot Bitcoin-based ones took years.Still, BlackRock boss Lary Fink recently stated that he believes that approval of spot Ethereum ETFs is still possible, even if the SEC eventually classifies Ethereum as a security. So far Ethereum, along with Bitcoin, has been named a commodity, but recently discussions begun to emerge, which question this decision by the SEC regarding Ethereum.Within the past 24 hours, Ethereum has demonstrated a rise of 3.70%, reaching $3,585. However, until that price increase happened, ETH saw a 5.19% decline from the local high of $3,667.

                        Singaporeans are increasingly viewing Bitcoin in a favorable light, thanks to the recent approval of spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) in the United States.According to a new report from the digital currency exchange Independent Reserve, 39% of Singaporeans have expressed a more favorable view of Bitcoin following the approval of spot Bitcoin ETFs. There is also a high awareness of the US SEC’s approval of spot Bitcoin ETFs among Singaporeans, with 51% of respondents indicating their knowledge of this development. Furthermore, 33% of participants are open to investing through an overseas offering since retail investors in Singapore do not have access to such products.Crypto Investors in Singapore Plan to Increase BTC Holdings
As the Bitcoin halving event approaches in April, 48% of crypto investors in Singapore plan to increase their Bitcoin holdings over the next 12 months. The report noted that this sentiment is particularly strong among those who already hold more than 50% of their portfolio in cryptocurrencies, with 68% intending to further increase their Bitcoin investments.When given a choice, 75% of Singaporeans prefer to invest directly in Bitcoin through a cryptocurrency exchange rather than using a Bitcoin ETF. The reasons cited for this preference include lower fees and a wider range of trading options available on cryptocurrency exchanges.“The long-awaited arrival of spot Bitcoin ETFs has supercharged the demand side for Bitcoin as billions of dollars from institutions have poured in,” Lasanka Perera, CEO of Independent Reserve Singapore, said. “The trust and understanding of Bitcoin have grown significantly over the past few years, and more Singaporeans are increasing their allocations.”The Independent Reserve Cryptocurrency Index (IRCI) for Singapore scored 56 this year, reflecting a positive shift in public perception toward cryptocurrencies. While overall awareness and ownership of cryptocurrencies may have slightly decreased, other key metrics suggest growing confidence and optimism in the market.Singaporean Crypto Investors Are Becoming Experienced
The study also revealed that Singaporean cryptocurrency investors are becoming more experienced. More than half (52%) have been in the market for over three years, and their portfolios are becoming increasingly diverse, with 16% now holding six or more different cryptocurrencies.Meanwhile, diversification remains a primary motivation for Singaporean crypto owners, with 52% investing in cryptocurrencies to expand their investment portfolios. Despite market volatility, 53% of respondents plan to invest more in their existing portfolios, while 45% expressed an interest in diversifying into new projects.Experienced investors, those with over five years of market experience, engage in frequent trading, with 61% trading at least once a week compared to newcomers. This year, 64% of crypto owners reported making profits, a significant increase from previous years, while only 10% experienced losses.More than half of the respondents (55%) believe that cryptocurrencies will be widely accepted by businesses and the general public, with 35% of non-crypto owners sharing this belief as well.A recent report by Seedly and Coinbase, conducted in the fourth quarter of 2023 and encompassing over 2,000 adults, found that 57% of respondents currently hold digital assets.The majority of respondents said they have invested between US$1,000 and $25,000.

Crypto is ‘too big to ignore’ for the charitable sector

Cryptocurrency adoption in the charity space is growing quickly, with 56% of the top 100 charities in the United States now accepting crypto donations as of January 2024, according to the 2024 annual report from crypto charity organization The Giving Block. This marks a huge turnaround for nonprofits, many of which were initially hesitant to adopt crypto payments.As the report states, “When we launched The Giving Block in 2018, we had to practically bust down doors to get nonprofits to talk to us about bitcoin.”The report adds, “A lot has changed since then.”Cointelegraph spoke with the Giving Block co-founder Alex Wilson to discover how attitudes are shifting and whether he expects to see charitable organizations trend toward greater crypto adoption in the future.“Yes, over time, we continue to see greater adoption of nonprofits accepting cryptocurrency donations,” said Wilson. “The market has become too big to ignore. There aren’t many markets in the world that allow a nonprofit to tap into a $2 trillion donor base.”Wilson believes knowledge and familiarity with cryptocurrency are key to this change.“Most of it is a matter of education. Many nonprofits just don’t realize how many people own cryptocurrency. Yet once they realize that, they come around to it pretty quickly,” he said.Keeping crypto donations simpleTo onboard as many charities as possible, the Giving Block aims to make it simple for charities to accept crypto donations. Part of that comes in the form of an auto-sell feature, which transfers crypto into dollars at the point of donation.“If they’d like, they can opt to hodl, but most are more comfortable liquidating the donations, similar to how they treat other non-cash donations like stock or other forms of property. Our goal is to make taking crypto just as easy as taking any other gift a nonprofit gets,” said Wilson. With this in mind, using a donation solution minimizes a nonprofit’s exposure to cryptocurrency. Recent: Ethereum Dencun upgrade lowers transaction fees for L2s“The main pitfall is trying to do too much without knowing what they’re doing,” said Wilson. “Some nonprofits have opted to take things on themselves rather than work with a trusted partner.”According to Wilson, it “doesn’t usually end well” for those who try to go it alone.Trusted partners: Streamlining adoptionSave the Children, a nonprofit focused on improving the lives of children worldwide, began accepting Bitcoin (BTC) in 2013 after Typhoon Haiyan struck the Philippines.Ettore Rossetti, head adviser for technology, marketing and innovation partnerships at Save the Children, told Cointelegraph that the path to accepting crypto donations wasn’t wholly straightforward, requiring several sign-offs from various departments before the initiative could move forward.“I secured the proper legal, financial and media communications permissions to be able to accept that Bitcoin donation,” said Rossetti, who admitted “there were concerns” centered around matters such as environmental impact.Even with those concerns, Rossetti managed to secure all necessary approvals within 24 hours, proving that where the will exists, progress can be very swift indeed. Having used various trusted partners from 2013 onward, Save The Children is now one of the many nonprofits working with The Giving Block. Many of its programs have benefited from the generosity of crypto donors.For example, in Afghanistan, crypto donors helped support humanitarian assistance for 730,000 children in the chaotic aftermath of the U.S. withdrawal.Following the 2023 earthquake in Syria and Turkey, crypto donations helped fund Save the Children’s water and sanitation program, reaching 1.1 million children and 2.6 million people in total.In Uganda, in cooperation with World of Women, Save the Children raised $100,000 — helping to meet the educational needs of 115,000 children and adolescents.Crypto’s troubled reputationAlthough crypto and charitable giving are becoming increasingly close-knit, there are still challenges ahead. The mainstream media isn’t always kind to the blockchain industry, and nonprofits must remain mindful of their reputation.Then there are figures such as U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren who associate the crypto industry with illicit activity. We asked Wilson what impact figures like Warren have on the industry.“It’s frustrating since Elizabeth Warren and other politicians have often used exaggerated or outright false data to support their claims,” said Wilson. “Luckily, the facts support us, and the evidence is clear that there is much less illicit activity than people like Elizabeth Warren claim. All the data points to there being less illicit activity in crypto than there is in the traditional economy.”Rossetti said that one thing Save the Children had to actively consider was the environment and “the reputational risk associated with issues such as energy utilization, especially proof-of-work chains like the Bitcoin blockchain.”Recent: Bitcoin halving hype: How retail investors can prepareFor Rossetti and Save the Children, the environment is something they are continually mindful of since climate change “exacerbates the problems facing children — more natural disasters and so on.”“We are the world’s first nonprofit to be part of the Green Climate Fund and the only children’s charity. So, we’re proud of that. We only have one planet,” said Rossetti.“But in looking at it more closely, just beyond headlines, many of the blockchains are powered by renewable sources or underutilized energy. And therefore, that essentially tends to be overblown.”Crypto for good: #HODLhopeSave the Children’s latest drive for crypto samaritans is #HODLhope. As the campaign states, “Around the world children are being robbed of their futures by a global economy built on inequality and greed. [...] Save the Children believes that blockchain technology and cryptocurrencies can be a force for good and a force for financial inclusion.”The aim of #HODLhope is to raise $10 million in crypto donations by the end of 2024, allowing children around the world to hold on to hope. Having raised nearly $8 million by March, the campaign looks sure to attain that.For the 44% of the top 100 U.S. charities that have yet to awaken to the power of Bitcoin and cryptocurrency more generally, now may be the time to take note.

QuadrigaCX founder could be forced to explain where he got his Rolex


Canadian authorities are petitioning courts to force QuadrigaCX co-founder Michael Patryn to explain how he came to be in possession of 45 gold bars, a diamond-studded Rolex watch, and more than $250,000 in cash.
As reported by Bloomberg, the Director of Civil Forfeiture in British Columbia has asked for a court order that would force Patryn to explain the assets which were seized in June 2021 two years after Quadriga’s collapse.
A 2020 investigation concluded that the exchange’s 2019 implosion was caused by fraudulent activity committed by the exchange’s other founder, Gerry Cotten. Cotten died in mysterious circumstances while on his honeymoon in 2018.
The probe also found that Patryn cut ties with QuadrigaCX after 2016 before the majority of the fraudulent activity took place. However, according to the most recent filing, chat records from 2014 and 2015 appear to show the founders discussing how they could appropriate customer funds and make it look as though Patryn had left the company.

In a previous filing, Patryn’s legal team claimed that the seized assets had no connection to any illegal activity. The latest application will be heard by a judge on April 30.
According to British Columbia’s solicitor general Mike Farnworth, if Patryn cannot or will not adequately explain how he came to own the cash and jewelry, he may be forced to forfeit them and see them donated to victims of crime and crime prevention services.

Bybit crypto exchange launches trading platform in the Netherlands

Bybit, one of the world’s largest cryptocurrency exchanges by trading volumes, is expanding operations in Europe after facing regulatory scrutiny in Hong Kong.On March 28, Bybit officially announced the launch of its digital asset platform, Bybit.nl, in the Netherlands. The new local trading platform is regulated in the country and designed to provide Dutch users access to cryptocurrency trading and education resources.The launch of Bybit.nl is enabled through collaboration with Satos, one of the oldest Bitcoin (BTC)-focused companies in the Netherlands. Through the partnership, Bybit’s Dutch users can deposit and withdraw fiat currency and trade over 300 pairs.Bybit’s launch in the Netherlands aims to further the company’s commitment to serving users while upholding regulatory compliance, Bybit co-founder and CEO Ben Zhou said. He added:“Through our partnership with SATOS, we aim to provide Dutch users with a secure and seamless trading experience, backed by industry-leading security measures and unparalleled support.”According to some local reports, Bybit was discontinuing some of its services in February 2024. The exchange specifically shut down derivatives services in the Netherlands in compliance with guidelines by the Dutch central bank. “The first changes to the new regulations will be effective from March 5,” Cryptotag’s head of communications Indy Rottier wrote in a LinkedIn post on Feb. 20.According to Rottier, other major global exchanges like Binance and Gemini were forced to terminate their operations in the Netherlands to comply with local laws in 2023.Cointelegraph approached Bybit for a comment regarding the Bybit.nl launch but had yet to receive a response at the time of publication.Related: Philippines to block Binance exchangeThe news comes a few weeks after Hong Kong’s Securities and Futures Commission (SFC) issued a public warning against Bybit on March 14. The regulator elaborated that Bybit offered crypto-related products in a number of jurisdictions without holding a license.“The SFC is concerned that these products have also been offered to Hong Kong investors and wishes to make it clear that no entity in the Bybit group is licensed by or registered with the SFC to conduct any ‘regulated activity’ in Hong Kong,” said the regulator.Established in 2018, Bybit is one of the world’s largest crypto exchanges. According to data from Kaiko, Bybit’s daily spot trading volume peaked at $4.3 billion on March 4, ranking the second biggest exchange after Binance, which reached nearly $24 billion in volumes on that day.Magazine: ‘SEAL 911’ team of white hats formed to fight crypto hacks in real time

Ethereum's Rising Validator Count Is Causing Concerns, Fidelity Digital Assets Says

The rapidly rising validator count on the Ethereum blockchain following the Shapella upgrade in April last year is causing concerns about technical capacity and centralization, Fidelity Digital Assets wrote in a research report on Thursday.

Fidelity noted that “with the lowered risk from increased liquidity, the active validator count has risen by 74%,” and said “future roadmap upgrades will become more difficult” with this larger set.

The Shapella upgrade enabled withdrawals, for the first time, for validators who staked their ether (ETH) to secure and validate transactions on the blockchain.

A large validator count is a concern because “bandwidth and latency are critical in a large validator set network, where each validator must independently download the latest data and verify state change proposals within a small time frame,” analyst Daniel Gray wrote, adding that “the larger the block (data), the more computing power needed to process and re-execute the transactions before the next slot.”

Every new validator adds a further connection to the network which increases the overall bandwidth that is needed to maintain consensus, the note said.

“The potential concern is that as the bandwidth requirements grow, the validators that are unable to keep pace will drop from the network - those that drop are more likely to be the self-hosted nodes,” Gray wrote. “If the average household struggles to keep up with the network, there is a risk of increased centralization over time, as the only hardware to survive may live within institution-owned data centers,” he added.

While the growth in the size of the validator set has slowed recently, it's unclear what the situation may be in a year from now, the report said; “therefore, the possibility of rapid growth could be a problem due to centralization and bandwidth risks.” 

The challenge of an expanding validator count has always been viewed as a “good problem” as it represents increased adoption and security for the Ethereum blockchain. Still “it is impossible to accurately predict the staking demand in the future,” the report added.

                        KuCoin, a cryptocurrency exchange, has announced an airdrop of Bitcoin and its native KuCoin (KCS) token, totaling $10 million, to their loyal customers, despite recent US DOJ charges.KuCoin CEO Johnny Lyu announced the news in a letter published on the exchange’s blog. The move comes amid legal challenges and charges filed by the United States Justice Department against the exchange and its founders.KuCoin CEO Expresses Gratitude to Users, Announces Special Airdrop EventOn March 27th, KuCoin’s CEO, Johnny Lyu, expressed gratitude to the exchange’s user base in a letter posted on the exchange blog. Despite recent challenges, including withdrawal delays on March 26th and 27th, Lyu emphasized KuCoin’s commitment to ensuring the security of user assets and complying with regulatory standards. He thanked users for their support and trust during this tumultuous period.Lyu mentioned that since their intervention, KuCoin’s mission has been to grow alongside the crypto industry and promote global recognition, acceptance, and affection for the sector. He drew parallels between the airdrop and the exchange’s past initiative to reimburse investors affected by the Confido rug pull.The CEO explained that some users experienced withdrawal delays due to high volumes, possibly from cautious customers withdrawing from the exchange. To show appreciation for users’ support and patience, KuCoin will initiate a special airdrop event totaling $10 million in KCS and BTC. Lyu highlighted that this proactive compensation marked the origin of the title “People’s Exchange,” reflecting the community’s affirmation of KuCoin. He said,“This act of proactive compensation marked the origin of the title “People’s Exchange”—a testament to the community’s original affirmation of us. We have always treasured this rare trust, and being “People’s Exchange” is our proudest label.”While Lyu did not directly mention the legal issues faced by the exchange, the airdrop serves as a token of gratitude to loyal users who stood by KuCoin during its challenging period. Detailed rules for the airdrop will be released in three days, ensuring transparency and clarity for users.KuCoin and Founders Indicted by U.S. Justice Department for Unlicensed Money Transmission
The timing of the airdrop is noteworthy, given the current legal actions against KuCoin. On March 26, United States Justice Department officials charged KuCoin and two of its founders with “conspiring to operate an unlicensed money-transmitting business” and violations of the Bank Secrecy Act, or BSA.The U.S. Department of Justice said KuCoin founders Chun Gan and Ke Tang had willfully failed to maintain an anti-money laundering program at the exchange, leading to the platform being used for “money laundering and terrorist financing.” According to the Justice Department, KuCoin received over $5 billion and sent over $4 billion of “suspicious and criminal funds.” The Commodity Futures and Trade Commission (CFTC) also charged KuCoin with multiple violations of the Commodity Exchange Act. The CFTC is seeking to impose fines and trading bans, while the DoJ is seeking forfeiture and to pursue criminal penalties.Following the Department of Justice’s filing of charges, KuCoin saw more than $1 billion worth of crypto withdrawals from the platform, which caused a 20% drop in assets under management. Nevertheless, the exchange comforted its customers, saying that all systems are running smoothly and the user funds are safe.Although popular in the crypto community, the concept of airdrops carries its own risks, especially from a regulatory standpoint. The “Framework for ‘investment contract’ Analysis of Digital Assets by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has outlined that airdrops might still satisfy the criteria of investment of money under the Howey test.

Tokenized Treasury Notes Surpass $1B

The market for tokenized U.S. Treasury debt is booming. The market value of Treasury notes tokenized through public blockchains like Ethereum, Polygon, Avalanche, Stellar and others has crossed above $1 billion for the first time, data tracked by Tom Wan, an analyst at crypto firm 21.co, show. Tokenized Treasuries are digital representations of U.S. government bonds that can be traded as tokens on the blockchain. The market value has risen nearly 10-fold since January last year and 18% since traditional finance giant BlackRock announced Etheruem-based tokenized fund BUIDL on March 20.

BlackRock's Larry Fink says Bitcoin's spot ETF is the fastest growing ETF in history | Cryptopolitan

BlackRock’s big boss Larry Fink just threw a piece of knowledge that’s got everyone talking. On a sunny day on Fox Business, he didn’t just chat about the weather but dropped a bomb about Bitcoin that’s echoing across the financial world. The word is out. BlackRock’s Bitcoin ETF, known as $IBIT, is smashing records left and right, becoming the champ of ETF growth speed in the history of the world. Now, that’s not something you hear every day. Fink’s confidence in Bitcoin isn’t just a passing cloud. He’s all in, betting on the cryptocurrency’s bright future. It’s not just a hunch; he’s seeing a tsunami of retail demand that’s turning the market into a more liquid, transparent beast than ever before. This isn’t your everyday financial forecast; it’s a bold statement from the helm of the world’s largest asset manager. And when Fink speaks, people don’t just listen; they take notes.Unprecedented Growth Sparks InterestLet’s cut to the chase. The explosion of BlackRock’s Bitcoin ETF is more than just impressive stats; it’s a signal, loud and clear, that Bitcoin is becoming a big deal in the investment world. The reasons? Think inflation jitters, economic roller coasters, and the hunt for something solid in a sea of financial uncertainty. Bitcoin, with its cap on how much exists and its freedom from central control, is looking pretty good as a safe haven and a spicy addition to investment portfolios.As $IBIT skyrockets, it’s not just about the numbers. Fink backing Bitcoin throws a huge dose of credibility into the crypto ring. Institutional eyeballs are turning towards Bitcoin, seeing it not just as digital gold but as a legit slice of a savvy investment strategy. This isn’t just another day at the stock market; it’s a glimpse into a future where Bitcoin plays a starring role.Let’s not forget the price tag on Bitcoin itself. After a bit of a rollercoaster, it’s on the up again, touching the sky at $71,500. And with Fink hinting at a possible climb to $80,000, all eyes are on the prize ahead of the Bitcoin halving. The air is electric with “what ifs,” as Bitcoin ETFs pull out of a slump and head for new heights.A New Era for Bitcoin InvestmentNow, onto the heavyweight facts. Since getting the green light from the SEC, BlackRock’s been on a shopping spree, scooping up 243,627 Bitcoins. Do the math, and you’re looking at $17 billion worth of digital gold. That’s a whole lot of Bitcoin, growing by the day, with sights set on hitting $22.6 billion by April’s end. If that doesn’t scream “momentum,” what does?This week alone, Bitcoin ETFs have seen a cash influx of $348 million. Just a week ago, things were looking a bit gloomy with a massive $800 million heading out the door. But the tide’s turned, with a fresh batch of Bitcoin worth nearly half a billion dollars making its way into ETFs. It’s a rollercoaster that’s going up, with Fink’s bullish outlook fueling the fire for Bitcoin’s ascent.The market’s buzzing, and Bitcoin’s potential to breach $80,000 is more than just cocktail chatter. It’s a possibility backed by hard cash and a growing investor appetite. And while some might worry about a bit of resistance around the $72,000 mark, Fink’s words have the power to turn holders into HODLers, paving the way for Bitcoin to not just hit new highs but to redefine them.There you have it. Clearly, we’re witnessing history in the making.

Stran & Company, Inc. Reports Record Q4 Sales of $23.3 Million - Tokenist


					
Neither the author, Tim Fries, nor this website, The Tokenist, provide financial advice. Please consult our website policy prior to making financial decisions.



Stran & Company, Inc. (NASDAQ: SWAG) has recently released its financial outcomes for the fourth quarter and fiscal year ending December 31, 2023, showcasing a remarkable boost in sales and profitability.



The Quincy, Massachusetts-based marketing solutions provider reported a 27.5% year-over-year sales increase for the fourth quarter, totaling approximately $23.3 million.



This surge in sales marks the highest quarterly revenue in the company’s history. Moreover, Stran achieved a gross profit of roughly $8.7 million during the same period, representing a substantial 63.5% increase from the previous year and pushing the gross margin to 37.4%.



The company’s operating income also saw a significant rise, with a 156.1% increase reaching approximately $1.1 million, coupled with net earnings of $883,000 for the fourth quarter of 2023. These figures reflect Stran’s enhanced operating efficiency and economies of scale, solidifying its position in the market.



Stran & Company’s Diluted $0.03 EPS Misses Expectations in Q4



Compared to the expectations set for the quarter, Stran & Company’s performance did not exceed analysts’ forecasts. The anticipated earnings per share (EPS) were pegged at $0.04, with revenue expectations at $27.1 million. The company’s revenue fell slightly short of projections, the basic EPS of $0.05 surpassed estimates, but the diluted EPS of $0.03 fell short of expectations.



This discrepancy underscores Stran’s ability to maintain a robust margin and operational leverage despite the challenges posed by purchasing costs and the integration of recent acquisitions. The positive variance in EPS can be attributed to the company’s focused efforts on enhancing sales and marketing strategies and the successful assimilation of acquired assets, which contributed significantly to the bottom line.





Stran & Company Provide Optimistic Guidance, Plans to Nurture Organic Growth



Stran & Company has provided guidance reflecting optimism for the continued growth trajectory. The company’s strategic acquisitions, including adding T R Miller Co., Inc. and others in the past two years, have broadened its geographical reach and bolstered warehousing and manufacturing capabilities.



Stran is keen to nurture its organic growth further while optimizing the synergies from its acquisitions. With an eye on expansion, the company is actively exploring further mergers and acquisitions opportunities.



Stran’s initiatives towards improving sales and marketing, including enhanced SEO and demand generation efforts, are expected to impact the contract pipeline positively. The company also boasts a solid balance sheet, with approximately $18.5 million in cash and investments as of the end of 2023.

Let's Break Down Vitalik Buterin's Latest Essay | Cryptopolitan

Vitalik Buterin, the brain behind Ethereum, dropped a thought bomb on the crypto community, challenging us to rethink what we know about decentralization. He’s not one to shy away from the tough topics, and this time, it’s no different. Buterin is throwing down the gauntlet, suggesting we might be doing decentralization all wrong. He’s proposing a wild idea: make the crypto world a fairer place by slapping bigger penalties on those who mess up in a way that screams, “I’m gaming the system.” Rethinking Penalties: A Game Changer for DecentralizationButerin’s not just talking out of his hat here. He’s got a plan, and it’s all about making big players sweat a little when they screw up. Right now, in Ethereum land, if you mess up, you get a slap on the wrist, a penalty. But here’s where Buterin turns the tables: what if the more you and your clone army mess up together, the more you pay?It’s like saying, “Oh, you thought you could outsmart the system by being everywhere at once? Think again.” This idea isn’t new to Ethereum, where they’ve already got some of this smart thinking in the slashing and inactivity leak mechanics. But Buterin’s saying it’s not enough. We need to dial it up for the everyday mistakes too, not just the once-in-a-blue-moon mega fails.He’s got the numbers to back it up. Buterin and co. have been crunching the data, looking at when validators are supposed to do their thing and when they actually do it. They’re also peeking into who’s who in the Ethereum zoo, linking validator IDs to the big names like Lido, Coinbase, and yes, even Buterin himself. The results? When validators in the same crew are supposed to attest at the same time and don’t, it happens way more than it should by sheer chance. This isn’t just bad luck; it’s a pattern.Buterin’s deep dive into the data shows us that, yes, these big validator clusters are messing up together more often than they should. It’s like they’re all tripping over the same cable. If things were really decentralized, these failures wouldn’t be so… cozy. They’d be all over the place, not huddled together, whispering, “Oops, we did it again.”Crunching the Numbers: The Buterin WayLet’s get into the nitty-gritty of how Buterin suggests we fix this. Imagine every slot in the Ethereum blockchain is a little contest, and if you miss more slots than the average, you start to rack up penalties. But here’s the kicker: these penalties grow the more you and your buddies miss together. It’s a way to say, “Play fair, or pay up.” And this isn’t just theoretical. Buterin ran the numbers, and the results are pretty telling. The more this penalty system is put into play, the less advantage the big guys have. Suddenly, being a behemoth with a zillion validators doesn’t look so hot.But what’s really going on here? Well, in the grand scheme of things, the total number of misses is pretty small. But for a big player, even a few misses can skew the numbers because they have so many validators. This means they can single-handedly bump up the failure rate for a slot, which, in turn, bumps up their penalties. It’s a self-own of epic proportions.So, could a big staker just spread out their validators to avoid these penalties? Sure, but then they lose their economies of scale, which is a fancy way of saying, “It’s gonna cost you.” And that’s the beauty of Buterin’s proposal. It’s a subtle nudge to big players, saying, “Maybe don’t put all your eggs in one basket.”

ChatGPT now helps you backtest simple trading strategies


ChatGPT, an artificial intelligence (AI) language model developed by OpenAI, has released a new tool designed to simplify the process of backtesting trading strategies. 
In a thread published on their X (formerly Twitter) account, on March 27, Pedma, a library of trading strategies, outlined a 6-step process. They utilized ChatGPT to backtest a simple moving average (MA) crossover strategy for Bitcoin (BTC) rather than a ChatGPT trading bot.
Here’s a breakdown of the key components:


ChatGPT Python 
In the first step, the user requests ChatGPT to provide Python code for importing the required libraries for backtesting a trading strategy, with a focus on data handling from Yahoo Finance and visualization. 
By providing the necessary tools right away, ChatGPT saves time and makes it easier for traders to turn their ideas into reality.
Data retrieval from Yahoo Finance
After setting up the initial libraries, Pedma asked ChatGPT how to get data. They wanted to know how to get historical Bitcoin price data (daily OHLC and volume) in Python, starting from January 1, 2020. 

With ChatGPT’s help, users can easily get important info like daily prices and trading volume. 
This means traders can focus on understanding market trends and improving their strategies without wasting time looking for data themselves.
ChatGPT trading strategy
In the third step of the process, Pedma asked ChatGPT to help define a trading strategy using the available Bitcoin data. Specifically, they requested guidance on creating a MA crossover strategy in Python using the ‘pandas tool.’ 
By offering clear guidance on strategy definition, ChatGPT enables traders to develop structured approaches to market analysis, which can help them make smarter decisions when dealing with the market.
Implement the backtest
Once the strategy was defined, Pedma inquired about implementing the backtest using Python and pandas to assess the strategy’s performance. 
They asked ChatGPT how to execute this step to analyze how well the strategy would perform in real market conditions. 
This step helped Pedma understand the effectiveness of their trading idea and its potential to succeed in the market.
Analyze the results and visualize
After completing the backtest, Pedma wanted to see the results and make a graph to show the returns. They asked ChatGPT how to do this using pandas and matplotlib.

Their goal was to understand the important numbers from the backtest and visualize the equity curve to show how the strategy worked with Bitcoin data.
Python code knowledge will help
In the final step, Pedma noticed a problem with the drawdown chart — it wasn’t showing the right data. So, they had to manually fix it to make sure it displayed the correct information. 
While ChatGPT automates much of the process, basic Python knowledge is still recommended. 
More complex strategies might require manual code adjustments, especially for accurate visualization.

Solana's stellar performance shakes up the Altcoin market

The surge by Solana (SOL) has been accompanied by more than 850% over the past year, yielding much better rewards. Six months ago, CRO was trading at around $21; after spearheading this more recent bull run, CRO has now captured a price of over $200, which leaves its competitors like Ethereum, Cardano, and Chainlink with only moderate gains. Solana’s dominance in the Altcoin marketOver this period, Ethereum and Cardano ascurred increased over 100%, while Chain link inscribed the gain of 200%. This remarkable role has also led to debates among the market players, including investors and analysts, on what tendencies may shape the future of this market. This remarkable role has also led to debates among the market players, including investors and analysts, on what tendencies may shape the future of this market.Against this background, the notorious Cardano supporter, Dan Gambardello, has recently spoken about Cardano’s current place amongst altcoins. Using the market data, Gambardo pointed out Solana’s unique growth rate, and this is the case of only coins, which managed to expand even faster than Bitcoin. Interestingly, he believes that Solana’s latest development is somewhat uncharacteristic but not completely without parallel.Bringing up the previous bull market analogy, Gambardello related to Chainlink’s tremendous gains before the Bitcoin halving event 2020, where the asset recorded lows of up to 1000% rise. Nevertheless, Chainlink’s vibrant performance in the events that followed the halving has been compacted in Gambardello’s forecasts, which cautiously indicate that Solana’s status may also change along this line.Gambardello’s inferences are not limited to historical exemplifications but provide a larger picture, which he explains will appear soon after the Bitcoin halving. He points out that Solana’s heightened presence in the digital currency world does not necessarily mean that the remaining crypto options will cease to be widely accepted. On the other hand, Gambardello believes this scenario would lead to adjusting the market balances, which would allow other anonymous cryptocurrencies to step forward.A changing game for altcoinsThe discussion surrounding Solana’s ascendancy and its implications for the altcoin market is multi-faceted. Gambardello’s comments shed light on the cyclical nature of the cryptocurrency market, suggesting that current market trends may not indicate long-term outcomes. His analysis implies that while Solana’s performance is noteworthy, it does not necessarily preclude other altcoins from experiencing significant gains in the future.This perspective is crucial for investors and market observers as it underscores the importance of looking beyond immediate market movements to understand underlying trends and potential shifts in market dynamics. As the Bitcoin halving approaches, the anticipation of an altcoin season offers a glimmer of hope for currencies that have yet to match Solana’s explosive growth.Moreover, Gambardello’s analysis serves as a reminder of the inherent unpredictability of the cryptocurrency market. Past performance, while informative, is not always a reliable predictor of future results. This unpredictability necessitates a balanced investment approach, where understanding the broader market context and potential catalysts for change is as important as analyzing individual asset performance.Solana’s remarkable surge in the cryptocurrency market has ignited discussions about the future of altcoins. While its dominance is undeniable, the insights provided by market analysts like Dan Gambardello suggest that the game is far from over for other leading cryptocurrencies.

Dogecoin Soars 17% To Break $0.21 As Volume Explodes


                            Dogecoin has jumped 17% in the past 24 hours to break past the $0.21 barrier as on-chain data shows a significant increase in volume for the memecoin.
Dogecoin Beats Market With 17% Rally In The Last Day
Most of the top cryptocurrencies have seen flat returns in the last 24 hours, but Dogecoin has gone its own way as the original meme coin has enjoyed a strong rally.

The below chart shows what the asset’s performance has looked like during the last few days:

The price of the coin appears to have sharply soared over the past day | Source: DOGEUSD on TradingView
In this latest rally, Dogecoin has surged more than 17% in the last 24 hours and has cleared the $0.21 level. Among the top 100 cryptocurrencies by market cap, only Bitcoin Cash (BCH) has registered comparable profits in the same period.
DOGE still beats BCH in the 1-week timeframe, however, as the memecoin has managed returns of more than 40% in this period, while the Bitcoin hard-fork has seen 33%.
The reason behind these two assets in particular seeing a strong performance may lie in the fact that Coinbase plans to add futures products for them starting the 1st of April. Litecoin (LTC) is also set to see a listing on the same day, but its performance has been much weaker than the other two.
In terms of market cap, Dogecoin is currently the eighth-largest coin in the sector, as the table below shows:

Looks like the market cap of the memecoin is just under $31 billion at the moment | Source: CoinMarketCap
From the table, it’s apparent that the gap to USD Coin (USDC) in seventh isn’t too much right now, so if Dogecoin can keep up its surge, it’s possible that it may be able to flip the stablecoin.
DOGE Transaction Volume Has Observed A Sharp Increase Recently
Something that would confirm that widespread speculation around Dogecoin is ripe for a rally currently would be its Transaction Volume. As a user on X pointed out using data from the on-chain analytics firm Santiment, DOGE’s Transaction Volume has shot up recently.
The “Transaction Volume” keeps track of the total amount of tokens (in USD) for a given cryptocurrency that has observed some movement on the blockchain in the past 24 hours.
When the value of this metric is high, it means that the users are transacting large amounts on the network right now. Such a trend implies the trading interest around the asset is high currently.
On the other hand, low values of the indicator can be a sign that the general interest in the cryptocurrency, both as an asset and a network, is low at the moment.

Now, here is a chart that shows the trend in the Dogecoin Transaction Volume over the past year:

The metric seems to have gone up in recent days | Source: @trader_kamikaze on X
As is visible in the chart, the Dogecoin Transaction Volume has experienced quite a boost recently, and what has accompanied this rise has been the latest rally.
A rising volume can often be a positive sign for the sustainability of any rally, as it means that interest in the asset is going up, and thus, more fuel is potentially coming in.
Something to keep in mind, though, is that selling and buying alike affect this indicator, so a mass selloff would also register as a spike in the metric. Thus, while high volumes are usually a requirement for rallies to continue (as without interest, the run can easily die down), they alone can’t predict a further rise, as the nature of this activity can be hard to ascertain.

Solana Future Clouded By Coinbase-SEC Ruling: Crypto Lawyer


								On Wednesday, the future of Solana may have been clouded by United States Southern District of New York’s Judge Katherine Polk Failla with her decision against Coinbase’s motion to dismiss. The ruling enables the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to advance its case against the crypto exchange giant. The case centers on allegations that Coinbase has been operating as an unregistered exchange, broker, and clearing agency, and its Staking Program constitutes the unregistered offer and sale of securities.
Solana (SOL) Is A Security: Judge Failla
The implications of this ruling extend far beyond Coinbase, striking a chord, particularly with the Solana community. The judge’s mention of SOL (and Chilliz (CHZ)) in the context of the lawsuit highlights the SEC’s position that both crypto assets are securities. Notably, the agency only has to prove that at least one of the 13 named tokens is a security, and Judge Failla specifically chose SOL (and CHZ) as an example to agree with the SEC’s arguments.

Bill Morgan, a pro-XRP lawyer, offered a detailed commentary on the ruling via X (formerly known as Twitter), drawing attention to the critical examination of SOL. Morgan stated, “One of these was Solana. She found that the SEC plausibly asserts that Coinbase facilitated transactions in crypto-asset ‘securities’. She clearly found that the SEC had plausibly argued sales of SOL were securities and did not accept sales on secondary markets were not securities.”
This observation underscores the heightened regulatory scrutiny and potential reclassification risks facing Solana and similar tokens. Morgan added, “It is a setback for Coinbase and does not look good for SOL sales not being found to be investment contracts. Seriously, if Coinbase was consistent in its reaction to the filing of the SEC v Ripple case in delisting XRP it would now delist SOL.”
In her ruling, Judge Failla detailed SOL’s operational history and its efforts to raise capital, thus framing the context for its potential classification as a security. “SOL” is described as a crypto-asset that is the native token of the Solana blockchain, a network designed to support decentralized applications (dApps) and characterized by its high transaction speeds and scalability.

The judge noted, “To raise capital, Solana Labs conducted a series of initial offerings of SOL to institutional investors. Between May 2018 and early March 2020, initial investors were provided with “sale and issuances rights to receive [SOL] tokens in the future via a Simple Agreement for Future Tokens (SAFTs). Through these offers and sales, Solana sold approximately 177 million SOL, raising over $23 million. Later in March 2020, Solana Labs conducted additional SOL sales on the CoinList trading platform in a “Dutch auction.”
This assessment not only underscores the magnitude of Solana’s fundraising efforts but also aligns with the criteria of an investment contract under the Howey Test—a benchmark for determining whether a transaction qualifies as a security. If SOL is adjudged to meet these criteria, the implications for SOL could be profound.
The classification of SOL as a security could introduce significant regulatory burdens and reshape its market dynamics.
Just last week, Anatoly Yakovenko, co-founder of Solana Labs, expressed his support for Ethereum amid escalating regulatory scrutiny. His statement, shared via X, came after it became known that the SEC is scrutinizing the Ethereum Foundation for a potential classification as a security. “If the state is against ethereum then I am against the state,” he stated.


It is also important to note that the SEC called Solana a security also in the Binance lawsuit, alongside other altcoins like Polygon, Cardano, Filecoin, Cosmos Hub, and gaming-centered projects such as The Sandbox, Decentraland, and Axie Infinity in June 2023. To date, the US agency hasn’t taken any action against Solana Labs.
Market response to the ruling was swift, with Solana’s price witnessing a 5.7% drop, although it managed to recover most of its losses today. At press time, SOL traded at $185.

Dogwifhat (WIF) Catching Up to DOGE and SHIB: Investors' Top Meme Coin Pick for 2024 - Benzinga

If you've looked at crypto in recent months, you've heard something about meme coins. New tokens constantly pop up; millionaires are made in minutes; and unbelievable returns are on the table. As the meme coin mania of early 2024 is beginning to calm down, some are looking for the token that could be the top pick for the remainder of 2024.dogwifhat (WIF), launched in late 2023, is a meme coin based on the Solana chain. The token is based on a picture of a Shiba Inu dog wearing a pink knitted cap. Unlike some meme coins that try to woo investors with ambitious plans for the future and a high-quality website, WIF leans into its identity, with the headline stating that it's "literally just a dog wif a hat." Don't Miss:The token exploded in 2024. It began the year hitting an all-time low of under $0.07. Since then, it has grown exponentially, reaching a high of $3.53 on March 14. At the high, it represented a gain of over 5,000% from lows, which came just two months earlier. The market cap went from around $200 million to well over $3 billion, helping the token cement itself in the top 50 tokens by market cap. WIF also helped revive the Solana chain. If investors wanted to buy the token, they had to buy SOL and swap it for WIF. This practice increased the use of the Solana chain and helped it appreciate over 150% since the launch of SHIB. Many thought that Solana would be unable to recover after the collapse of FTX, but WIF, along with other meme coins and projects, helped SOL recover to near-all-time highs (ATHs).There have been several catalysts for WIF, such as Binance offering the token and LeBron James wearing a pink hat. While the event with James was a coincidence, it brought more attention to the token. The hype hasn't ended yet. WIF investors are eyeing the top spot in terms of meme coins. For this to happen, WIF would have to surpass DOGE and SHIB, which have market caps in the tens of billions.For WIF to catch SHIB, the token would have to go up by an additional 500% from current levels. While this may seem like a lot, it is not out of the question considering WIF's past price movements. It will be interesting to see what is in store for WIF this year. The project could go in several directions, but where WIF ends up will likely be the result of market sentiment, which changes constantly and could work to the benefit or detriment of WIF. Read Next:

"Settling transactions to Base has the benefit of enabling more seamless bridging and on/off-ramping from Base and Coinbase for users and developers."Degen Chain will host the DEGEN token and community moving forward, with the project also inviting third-party developers to build on top of the network.Jacek, the founder of DEGEN, noted that several socialfi-focused applications have already expressed an interest in building on Degen Chain, including Farcaster frames PayBot, Perl, and LottoPGF.DEGEN ralliesDEGEN launched in January, with its developers seeking to ride the momentum of Farcaster, the recently surging decentralized social platform.Farcaster’s daily active user base rocketed by around 2,000% to an all-time high of 40,000 in early February from roughly 2,000 at the start of January, according to Dune Analytics. Farcaster hosted more than 32,000 active users in 24 hours on March 26.DEGEN was airdropped to Farcaster users and positioned itself as a mechanism to reward activity on the platform, such as tipping and liquidity mining. The token has since enjoyed explosive growth, with its price doubling in the past week and rocketing 2,045% in 30 days, according to CoinGecko.DEGEN/USD price history.

Logan Paul Counters CryptoZoo Scam Claims in New Documentary - DailyCoin


        
Logan Paul has told his side of the story on CryptoZoo.



The internet celebrity spoke in a new documentary.



Paul said he would “take care” of the people who made the project look like a scam.
While featuring in a new documentary by journalist Graham Bensinger, YouTuber Logan Paul once again defended his failed CryptoZoo project, saying it “isn’t a scam.”Paul’s rocky escapade with his defunct NFT-based game started last year when blockchain detective Coffeezilla created a multi-part video expose titled Investigating CryptoZoo. In the expose, Coffeezilla chronicles the project’s rise and ultimate fall, presenting evidence that Paul and his team might have conducted their “biggest scam.”While Paul seemingly took accountability, pledging a $2.3 million buyback plan on January 4 to compensate for losses endured by NFT traders, the controversial internet star had another story to tell.Paul’s Side of the Story on CryptoZooTitled 5 Months with Logan Paul, the 54-minute documentary tackles various allegations levied against the internet star. Bensinger stresses how the failed CryptoZoo project “led people to lose money.”Without dismissing the fact that people lost money, Paul argued that the project was not a scam.“Everything you just said has an element of truth to it. Here’s the problem. What you just described isn’t a scam. I took on a project that I was simply incapable of handling at the time,” Paul stated. “I’ve lost half a million dollars on this. Where is the scam?”Paul stated that the CryptoZoo saga “is far from over because it was a one-sided story” and that he would “take care” of the people who made it look like a scam he engineered.
“He [Coffeezilla] told it how he wanted to tell it and told it a certain way that made me look like the captain of the ship.” Paul said.Besides countering the scam allegations, Paul implied that he was a victim of CryptoZoo, too, claiming the project’s predicaments led him to “having suicidal thoughts for the first time” in his life.Stay updated on QuadrigaCX co-founder Michael Patryn’s woes in Canada:

20 Billion Dollar Cryptocurrency Investigation from USA and UK to Russia! - Bitcoin Sistemi


According to Bloomberg, the USA and the UK are investigating the $20 billion cryptocurrency transfer sent to the Russian stock exchange.
The United States and Britain are examining more than $20 billion in cryptocurrency transfers through a Russia-based virtual exchange as part of Russia's efforts to evade sanctions, according to people familiar with the matter.


Knowledgeable people said that the $20 billion transfer examined was made through the Moscow-based cryptocurrency exchange Garantex and using Tether (USDT).
It was stated that the transfers in question took place since Garantex was sanctioned by the USA and the UK on suspicion of facilitating financial crimes and illegal transactions in Russia.





Sources said the $20 billion transaction was one of the largest sanctions violations since the beginning of sanctions against Russia.
At this point, Tether, which supported the investigation, said that it had frozen all assets of the organizations whose addresses were on the US sanctions list related to the US-UK investigation.


Tether said in a statement to Bloomberg:

“With Tether, every action can be online, every transaction can be tracked, every asset can be seized, and every criminal can be caught.
“We are working with law enforcement to do exactly that in relation to the US-UK investigation.”

Crypto's true power lies in its small yet impactful nature | Cryptopolitan

Katherine Dowling from Bitwise Asset Management compared investing in cryptocurrency to adding cayenne pepper to a dish during a conference in West Palm Beach, Florida. She meant that just a small amount of crypto can make a big difference in an investment portfolio. Ivory Johnson, a financial advisor and CNBC Council member, agrees with Dowling. He believes that because cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin are so up and down, investors should only need a little bit in their portfolios to see an impact. Johnson, who runs Delancey Wealth Management, suggests that having 2% to 3% of your investment in crypto is plenty.Understanding Crypto’s Role in Your PortfolioJohnson points out that cryptocurrencies are an “alternative investment,” different from traditional stocks, bonds, and cash. He explained that even a tiny bit of crypto could grow fast and balance out other slower-growing investments in your portfolio.Investing in crypto depends a lot on how much risk someone can handle. Johnson mentioned that younger investors might go for a bigger slice of crypto, up to 5% to 7%, because they have time to bounce back from any losses. However, he cautioned against older investors putting too much into crypto due to the high risk of losing their retirement savings.The unpredictability of crypto is well-known. Bitcoin, for example, reached an all-time high of over $73,000 before dropping below $69,000. Despite a rough 2022, Bitcoin’s value has significantly rebounded, showing its volatile nature.The Highs and Lows of Investing in CryptoThe ease of investing in crypto improved with the introduction of bitcoin exchange-traded funds approved by the Securities and Exchange Commission. Johnson suggests buying a small amount over time and adjusting investments to keep the portfolio balanced.A story of resilience came from Heather Ferguson, whose son lost $130,000 when the FTX crypto exchange collapsed. Later, he learned he would get his money back, which showed the unpredictable nature of investing in crypto.The legal saga around Sam Bankman-Fried, the former executive of FTX found guilty of fraud, adds another layer of drama to the crypto world. His sentencing is under debate, with some arguing for leniency due to efforts to repay affected customers.Bankman-Fried’s trial revealed deep issues within the crypto industry and sparked discussions about the impact of neurological conditions on behavior and decision-making. Letters from concerned parents, including those with children on the autism spectrum, highlighted these complexities.Maria Centrella and Matt Kelly, both parents of children with autism, shared their perspectives, hoping to influence the sentencing by pointing out that those on the spectrum may process situations differently.

Institutional Demand and Technicals Remain Bullish for Bitcoin Despite Strong Price Resistance | Coinspeaker



Major institutional investors, such as BlackRock and ARK 21Shares, have invested $323 million and $200 million, respectively, signaling their confidence in BTC Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs)

The cryptocurrency market has been a battleground of bulls and bears. Bitcoin (BTC) has faced a series of short-term volatility events, forming various highs and lows as it struggles to reclaim its previous all-time high.
Bitcoin’s price broke above $70,000 again two days ago, prompting many analysts to jump into predictions. The prevailing one being that the coin was going to break into an all-time high (ATH) in no time. Since then, BTC has been consolidating, trading sideways within the range of $69,000 to $71,000 and closing at $70,000 and around $69,400 on Tuesday and Wednesday, respectively.




Ali Charts, a prominent onchain analyst, shed light on the coin’s price struggle to regain its new all-time high and explained that there are crucial resistance levels at $70,180 and $70,600. These price points are levels where there are a lot of selling orders from BTC bears. According to his on-chain analytics, 292,000 and 397,000 addresses are creating strong resistance at those prices, respectively. He continued by saying that if the bulls can successfully break above those resistances, there is a significant barrier again on their way to another ATH.


Technical Analysis Unveils Bullish Potential
Ali, in a different post, further revealed that the coin appears to be breaking out of a bull flag pattern on the 4-hour chart. If BTC can maintain its position above the $70,000 level, the analyst anticipates a surge of nearly 10%, propelling BTC to an all-time high of $77,000.
Echoing this optimism is another notable crypto analyst, Benjamin Cowen, founder of ITC Crypto, who opined that the BTC dominance train is about to leave its station, further fueling the confidence of the bulls and creating a favorable market environment for Bitcoin and potentially for other cryptocurrencies as well.
Institutional Influx Fuels Bullish Sentiment
Fueling the bullish sentiment is the substantial inflow of capital into the crypto market over the past 24 hours. Major institutional investors, such as BlackRock and ARK 21Shares, have invested $323 million and $200 million, respectively, signaling their confidence in BTC Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs). This active buying aligns with Bitcoin’s positive price movement and could potentially shift market dynamics.
Corroborating the increasing demand, Ali revealed that whales (large investors) have accumulated more than 100,000 BTC, worth approximately $7 billion, over the past seven days. The substantial accumulation by institutional and high-net-worth individuals further showcases the growing interest in BTC as a viable investment asset.


Judging from analysts predictions about a bullish rally and significant whale accumulation, this indicates a potential upward trend. The resistances that are stopping the price from going upward seem to be very temporary. In no time, we should see the price hit an all-time high, which could also affect market sentiment towards altcoins and drive them bullish.

This Analyst Foresees Crash for Dogecoin (DOGE) and Shiba Inu (SHIB) Prices as Emerging Rival Gains Favor with Whales | Cryptopolitan

The cryptocurrency market is in a state of flux as emerging projects challenge the dominance of established tokens like Dogecoin (DOGE) and Shiba Inu (SHIB). With the rise of Retik Finance (RETIK), an innovative newcomer, some analysts are predicting a significant shift in market dynamics. Let us delve into the analysis of an expert who foresees a crash in DOGE and SHIB prices as Retik Finance gains favor among influential investors known as “whales.”The Emergence of Retik Finance (RETIK)Retik Finance has quickly gained traction in the cryptocurrency space, offering a range of innovative features and solutions that address the limitations of traditional finance. From futuristic DeFi debit cards to AI-powered peer-to-peer lending, Retik Finance has positioned itself as a formidable competitor to established meme coins like DOGE and SHIB. Retik Finance has achieved a significant milestone by securing over $32 million in total funds, showcasing its robust development momentum and active engagement with investors. This accomplishment underscores the platform’s unwavering commitment to growth and innovation within the cryptocurrency industry. Furthermore, Retik Finance’s successful completion of a thorough audit by Certik, a highly esteemed blockchain security firm, bolsters its credibility and resilience, instilling confidence among investors. The platform’s strategic initiatives, including the recent $333,000 giveaway event, have played a pivotal role in fostering vibrant community participation and bolstering investor confidence in Retik Finance. This event not only served as a means to reward the community for their unwavering support but also demonstrated the platform’s dedication to engaging with its user base. In acknowledgment of Retik Finance’s achievements during the presale phase, the platform is thrilled to announce a special $5000 giveaway. Participating is straightforward: users are encouraged to share an original photo, video, or meme that encapsulates their excitement for Retik Finance. Twenty-five fortunate winners will each receive $200 as a token of appreciation for their steadfast support and dedication to the Retik Finance community.The Downfall of Dogecoin (DOGE)Once hailed as the “people’s cryptocurrency,” Dogecoin’s meteoric rise has been overshadowed by its lack of utility and technological stagnation. Analysts argue that DOGE’s reliance on social media hype and celebrity endorsements makes it vulnerable to market manipulation and sudden price crashes.The Decline of Shiba Inu (SHIB) Shiba Inu, another meme-inspired token, faces similar challenges as DOGE. Despite its vibrant community and ambitious ecosystem plans, SHIB’s lack of real-world use cases and reliance on speculative trading have raised concerns among investors.The Rise of Retik Finance (RETIK) and Whale Favoritism Retik Finance’s innovative features and proactive community engagement have attracted the attention of influential investors known as “whales.” These deep-pocketed individuals have begun accumulating RETIK tokens, signaling a shift in favor away from DOGE and SHIB. According to the analyst, the increasing favoritism towards Retik Finance among whales could lead to a significant sell-off in DOGE and SHIB prices. With Retik Finance offering a more robust and innovative platform, investors may opt to reallocate their funds, causing a downward spiral in DOGE and SHIB’s market value. As Retik Finance continues to gain momentum and favor among influential investors, the future looks uncertain for Dogecoin and Shiba Inu. While both tokens have enjoyed periods of success, their reliance on hype and speculation may not be enough to sustain long-term growth. About Retik FinanceRetik Finance (RETIK) is a cutting-edge decentralized finance (DeFi) project revolutionizing global transactions with its innovative suite of financial solutions.

FTX's SBF Sentenced to 25 Years in Prison

Prior to receiving his sentence from the judge, Bankman-Fried spoke for several minutes in which, repeatedly, he made the claim that "there were enough assets, there are enough assets" for FTX's creditors to get paid back in full. The focus of Bankman-Fried and two victims who also spoke focused primarily on the FTX bankruptcy estate and its proposed payouts to creditors, which they all said are lower than they should be given current market prices. Bankman-Fried named three of the government's key witnesses, Nishad Singh, Gary Wang and Caroline Ellison, and expressed regret for his role in FTX's collapse.

Creating ‘good’ AGI that won’t kill us all: Crypto’s Artificial Superintelligence Alliance


            
After a year of increasingly dire warnings about the imminent demise of humanity at the hands of superintelligent artificial intelligence (AI), Magazine is in Panama at the Beneficial AGI Conference to hear the other side of the story.Attendees include an eclectic mix of transhumanists, crypto folk, sci-fi authors including David Brin, futurists and academics.  



We’re at the conference run by SingularityNET, a key member of the proposed new Artificial Superintelligence Alliance, to find out what happens if everything goes right with creating artificial general intelligence (AGI) — human-level, artificial general intelligence.



But how do we bring about that future, rather than the scenario in which Skynet goes rogue and kills us all?



One of the best insights into why those questions are so important comes from futurist Jose Luis Cordeiro, author of The Death of Death, who believes humanity will cure all diseases and aging thanks to AGI.He tells Magazine of some sage wisdom that Arthur C. Clarke, the author of 2001: A Space Odyssey, once told him.  




“He said: ‘We have to be positive about the future because the images of the future — of what’s possible — begin with our minds. If we think we will self-destroy, most likely we will. But if we think that we will survive, [that] we will move into a better world [then we] will work toward that and we will achieve it.’ So it begins in our minds.”




Janet Adams, CEO of SingularityNET, warms the conference up with some yoga. (Fenton)



Beneficial AGI: The quest for artificial general intelligence 



Humans are hardwired to focus more on the existential threats from AGI than on the benefits.Evolutionary speaking, it’s better that our species worries nine times too often that the wind rustling in the bushes could be a tiger than it is to be blithely unconcerned about the rustling and get eaten by a tiger on the 10th occurrence.






Even the doomers don’t put a high percentage chance of AGI killing us all, with a survey of almost 3000 AI researchers suggesting the chance of an extremely bad outcome ranges from around 5% to 10%. So while that’s worryingly high, the odds are still in our favor.Also read: Ben Goertzel profile — How to prevent AI from ‘annihilating humanity’ using blockchain



Opening the conference, SingularityNET founder and the “Father of AGI,” Dr. Ben Goertzel, paid tribute to Ethereum founder Vitalik Buterin’s concept of defensive accelerationism. That’s the midpoint between the effective accelerationism techno-optimists and their “move fast and break things” ethos, and the decelerationists, who want to slow down or halt the galloping pace of AI development.Goertzel believes that deceleration is impossible but concedes there’s a small chance things could go horribly wrong with AGI. So he’s in favor of pursuing AGI while being mindful of the potential dangers. Like many in the AI/crypto field, he believes the solution is open-sourcing the technology and decentralizing the hardware and governance.

What is the Artificial Superintelligence Alliance?



This week SingularityNET announced it has teamed up with the decentralized multi-agent platform FetchAI — founded by DeepMind veteran Humayun Sheikh — and the data exchange platform Ocean Protocol to form the Artificial Superintelligence Alliance (ASI).It will be the largest open-sourced independent player in AI research and development and has proposed merging SingularityNET, FetchAI and Ocean Protocol’s existing tokens into a new one called ASI. It would have a fully diluted market cap of around $7.5 billion — subject to approval votes over the next two weeks. The three platforms would continue to operate as separate entities under the guidance of Goertzel, with Sheikh as chair.According to the Alliance, the aim is to “create a powerful compelling alternative to Big Tech’s control over AI development, use and monetization” by creating decentralized AI infrastructure at scale and accelerating investment into blockchain-based AGI.







What are the benefits of AGI?



Probably the most obvious beneficial impact is AGI’s potential to analyze huge swathes of data to help solve many of our most difficult scientific, environmental, social and medical issues.



We’ve already seen some amazing medical breakthroughs, with MIT researchers using AI models to evaluate tens of thousands of potential chemical compounds and discovered the first new class of antibiotics in 60 years, one that’s effective against the hitherto drug-resistant MRSA bacteria. It’s the sort of scaling up of research that’s almost impossible for humans to achieve.And that’s all before we get to the immortality and mind-uploading stuff that the transhumanists get very excited about but which weirds most people out.  



This ability to analyze great swathes of data also suggests the technology will be able to give early warnings of pandemics, natural disasters and environmental issues. AI and AGI also have the potential to free humans from drudgery and repetitive work, from coding to customer service help desks.






While this will cause a massive upheaval to the workforce, the invention of washing machines and Amazon’s online businesses had big impacts on particular occupations. The hope is that a bunch of new jobs will be created instead.



Economic professor Robin Hanson says this has happened over the past two decades, even though people were very concerned at the turn of the century that automation would replace workers.  



Hanson’s study of the data on how automation impacted wages and employment across various industries between 1999 and 2019 found that despite big changes, most people still had jobs and were paid pretty much the same.



“On average, there wasn’t a net effect on wages or jobs in automation of U.S. jobs from 1999 to 2018,” he says.

AGI could make better decisions than we can: SingularityNET CEO Janet Adams 



Janet Adams, the optimistic CEO of SingularityNET, explains that AGI has the potential to be “extraordinarily positive for all humanity.”



“I see a future in which our future AGIs are making decisions which are more ethical than the decisions which humans make. And they can do that because they don’t have emotions or jealousy or greed or hidden agendas,” she says.Adams points out that 25,000 people die every day from hunger, even as people in rich countries throw away mountains of food. It’s a problem that could be solved by “intelligent allocation of resources across the planet,” she says. But Adams warns AGI needs to be trained on data sets reflecting the entire world’s population and not just the top 1% so that when they make decisions, “they won’t make them just for the benefit of the powerful few, they will make them for the benefit of the broader civilization, broader humanity.”



AI safety and ethics: Addressing the concerns



Anyone who watched the early utopian dreams of a decentralized internet crumble into a corporate ad-filled landscape of addictive design and engagement farming may have doubts this rosy future is possible.Building high-end AI requires a mountain of computing and other resources that are currently out of reach of all but a handful of the usual suspects: Nvidia, Google, Meta and Microsoft. So the default assumption is that one of these tech giants will end up controlling AGI.Goertzel, a long-haired hippy who plays in a surprisingly good band fronted by a robot, wants to challenge that assumption. 



Goertzel points out that the default assumption used to be that companies like IBM would win the computing industry and Yahoo would win search.

“The reason these things change is because people were concretely fighting to change it in each instance,” he says. “Instead, Bill Gates, Steve Jobs and the Google guys came along.”



The founder of SingularityNET, he’s been thinking about the Singularity (a theoretical moment when technological development increases exponentially) since the early 1970s when he read an early book on the subject called The Prometheus Project. 



He’s been working on AGI for much of the time since then, popularizing the term AGI and launching the OpenCog AI framework in 2008.



Adams says Goertzel is a key reason SingularityNET has a credible shot.“We are the biggest not-for-profit, crypto-funded AI science and research team on the planet,” Adams says, noting their competitors have been focused on “narrow AIs” like ChatGPT and are only now shifting their strategy to AGI.



“They’re years behind us,” she says. “We have three decades of research with Dr. Ben Goertzel in neural symbolic methods.”



But she adds that opening up the platform to any and all developers around the world and rewarding them for their contribution will give it the edge even over the mega-corporations who currently dominate the space.



“Because we have a powerful vision and a powerful commitment to building the most advanced, most intelligent AGI in a democratic way, it’s hard to imagine that Big Tech or any other player could come in and compete, particularly when you’re up against open source.”



“[We will] see a potentially huge influx of people developing on the SingularityNET marketplace and the continued escalation of pace toward AGI. There’s a good chance it will be us.”



HyperCycle CEO Toufi Saliba (Fenton)



Decentralized AI: Opening the door to open source development 



The Prometheus Project proposed that AI was such an earth-shattering development that everyone in the world should get a democratic vote on its development.



So when blockchain emerged, it seemed like implementing decentralized infrastructure and token-based governance for AI was the next most practical alternative.



HyperCycle CEO Toufi Saliba tells Magazine this mitigates the threat of a centralized company or authoritarian country gaining immense power from developing AGI first, which would be “the worst thing that ever happened to humanity.”



Also read: Real AI use cases in crypto, No 1: The best use of money for AI is crypto It’s not the only potential solution to the problem. Meta chief AI scientist Yan Le Cun is a big proponent of open-sourcing AI models and letting a thousand flowers bloom, while X owner Elon Musk recently open-sourced the model for Grok.



But blockchain is arguably a big step up. SingularityNET aims to network the technology around the world, with different components controlled by different communities, thereby spreading the risk of any single company, group or government controlling the AGI.






“So you could use these infrastructures to implement decentralized deep neural networks, you could use them to implement a huge logic engine, you can use them to implement an artificial life approach where you have a simulated ecosystem and a bunch of little artificial animals interacting and trying to evolve toward intelligence,” explains Goertzel.




“I want to foster creative contributions from everywhere, and it may be some, you know, 12-year-old genius from Tajikistan comes up with a new artificial life innovation that provides a breakthrough to AGI.”




It’s possible the fate of the world may rest in this man’s hands. (Fenton)



What is HyperCycle? What is OpenCog Hyperon?



HyperCycle is a ledgerless blockchain that’s fast enough to allow AI components to communicate, coordinate and transact to finality in under 300 milliseconds. The idea is to give AIs a way to call on the resources of other AIs, paid for via microtransactions.For now, the fledgling network is being used for small-scale applications, like an AI app calling on another AI service to help complete a task. But in time, as the network scales, it’s theoretically possible that AGI might be an emergent property of the various AI components working together in a sort of distributed brain. 



“So, in that approach, the entire world has a much higher chance to get to AGI as a single entity,” Saliba says.



Goertzel didn’t develop HyperCycle for that reason — he just needed something miles faster than existing blockchains to enable AIs to work together.  



The project he’s most excited about is OpenCog Hyperon, which launches in alpha this month. It “combines together deep neural nets, logic engines, evolutionary learning and other AI paradigms in the same software framework, for updating the same extremely decentralized Knowledge Graph.”The idea is to throw open the doors to anyone who wants to work on it in the hope they can improve the METTA AGI programming language so it can scale up massively. “We will have the complete toolset for building the baby AGI,” he says. “To get something I would want to call it baby AGI we will need that million times speed up of the METTA interpreter,” he says.



“My own best guess is that Opencog Hyperon may be the system to make the [AGI] breakthrough.”



AI governance: The role of voting systems 



Of course, decentralization does not ensure things will go right with AGI. As Goertzel points out, the government of Somalia was decentralized very widely in the 1990s under a bunch of warlords and militias, but it would have been preferable at the time to live under the centralized government of Finland.Furthermore, token-based governance is a long way from being fit for prime time. In projects like Uniswap and Maker, large holders like a16z and the core team have so many tokens it’s almost not worth anyone else voting. Many other decentralized autonomous organizations are wracked by politics and infighting.The surging price of crypto/AI projects has attracted a bunch of token speculators. Are these really the people we want to put in control of AGI?



Goertzel argues that while blockchain projects are currently primarily attractive to people interested in making money, that will change as the use case evolves. 



“If we roll out the world’s smartest AI on decentralized networks, you will get a lot of other people involved who are not primarily oriented toward financial speculation. And then it’ll be a different culture.”



But if the Artificial Superintelligence Alliance does achieve AGI, wouldn’t its tokens be ludicrously expensive and out of reach of those primarily interested in beneficial AGI?Goetzel suggests that perhaps a weighted voting system that prioritizes those who have contributed to the project may be required:



“I think for guiding the mind of the AGI, we want to roll out a fairly sophisticated, decentralized reputation system and have something closer to one person, one vote, but where people who have some track record of contributing to the AI network and making some sense, get a higher weighting.”



As Goertzel has told Magazine previously, our chances of controlling AGI after a certain point are slim. (Fenton)

Call of Duty cheaters targeted with crypto-draining software


Gamers downloading cheats for the first-person shooter Call of Duty are reportedly being targeted by crypto-draining malware that has so far compromised the details of more than 4.9 million accounts.
Call of Duty cheat provider Phantom Overlay was made aware of the malware campaign this week after users started to make unauthorized purchases. Phantom Overlay provides a marketplace for Call of Duty gamers to buy cheats, such as aimbot and player detection behind walls.
As reported by malware sleuth VX Underground, an unknown entity is using malware to steal the credentials of cheaters before publishing them online. The culprit has also infected users with crypto-draining malware capable of stealing bitcoin from Electrum wallets.

Malware campaign spawns unlikely alliance 
VX claims that “in a bizarre twist of fate,” video game company Activision Blizzard is working alongside cheat providers to help users infected with the malware because “The scope of the impact is so large.”
Indeed, VX reports that the accounts of an estimated 3,662,627 Battlenet, 561,183 Activision, 117,366 Elitepvpers, 572,831 UnknownCheats, and 1,365 Phantom Overlay have been compromised, making up 4,915,372 accounts altogether.

Phantom Overlay reportedly approached gaming forum Elitepvpers, which confirmed that over 40,000 of its accounts were comprised
VX Underground claims that the amount of crypto stolen and the malware delivery methods are currently unknown. VX also clarified that not all of the comprised accounts are cheaters, adding that some impacted users were utilizing software for latency improvement, controller boosting, and VPNs.
Protos has contacted Phantom Overlay, Elitepvpers, and Activision Blizzard for comment and will update if we hear back.

Is MicroStrategy's Bitcoin Strategy a Double-Edged Sword? This Hedge Fund Thinks So - Tokenist


					
Neither the author, Tim Fries, nor this website, The Tokenist, provide financial advice. Please consult our website policy prior to making financial decisions.



Kerrisdale Capital has recommended a unique investment strategy involving Bitcoin and MicroStrategy (NASDAQ: MSTR) shares. The investment firm suggests going long on Bitcoin while shorting MicroStrategy shares, anticipating that the premium at which MicroStrategy often trades due to its Bitcoin holdings might contract, as it has in the past.



Hedge Fund Claims MicroStrategy’s Premium Cannot Be Sustained and ‘Leverage Cuts Both Ways’



MicroStrategy is often considered a proxy for Bitcoin due to its strategic decision to hold the cryptocurrency as a store of value and use debt to purchase more Bitcoin.



Kerrisdale argues that the premium at which MicroStrategy’s stock trades is excessively high, especially given the increasing accessibility of Bitcoin to investors through brokerages, exchanges, and new spot exchange-traded funds.



These developments have diminished MicroStrategy’s unique position as a way for investors to gain exposure to Bitcoin. While MicroStrategy’s stock has surged over 200% alongside Bitcoin’s record rally, Kerrisdale notes that the premium to Bitcoin can both benefit and harm shareholders.



The report also highlights the downside of MicroStrategy’s leverage strategy. Despite the company increasing its Bitcoin holdings, the massive dilution has kept the amount of Bitcoin per share virtually unchanged. Shareholder value has mainly been driven by Bitcoin’s price appreciation rather than any unique value added by MicroStrategy.



Betting against MicroStrategy has been unprofitable for short sellers, who have faced significant paper losses this year. However, Kerrisdale’s pair trade strategy suggests that there may be an opportunity to profit from the potential contraction of MicroStrategy’s premium while still benefiting from the appreciation of Bitcoin itself.





MicroStrategy’s Bitcoin Buys Summarized



MicroStrategy has amassed a significant portfolio of Bitcoin, totaling 214,245 Bitcoins at a current price of $71,413.03 per Bitcoin. The portfolio’s total value is an impressive $15.34 billion, representing an all-time profit of approximately $7.76 billion, or a 102.4% increase from the initial investment. The company’s average purchase price, or dollar-cost average, is $35,372.59 per Bitcoin.



MicroStrategy’s purchases have been made at various price points, ranging from as low as $10,419.15 to as high as $68,477.00 per Bitcoin, with a total reported cost of $7.578 billion.



The portfolio has experienced varying degrees of profit across different transactions, with percentages ranging from 20.4% to over 500% for specific buys.



MicroStrategy Stock Brief



MicroStrategy shares were trading at $1,889.00, down $30.16 (-1.57%), as of 10:40 AM EDT on Thursday. The company has a market capitalization of $32.053 billion.



The stock opened at $1,942.00 and has fluctuated between $1,822.23 and $1,989.00 throughout the day, compared to the previous close of $1,919.16. Over the past 52 weeks, the stock has traded between $266.00 and $1,999.99.



The trading volume for the day stood at 1,121,956 shares, lower than the average volume of 2,254,900 shares. The stock has a beta of 2.83 (5-year monthly) and a PE ratio (TTM) of 71.34, with earnings per share (TTM) of $26.48.



The company is expected to report its next earnings between April 29, 2024, and May 3, 2024. MicroStrategy does not currently offer a forward dividend. Analysts have set a one-year target estimate for the stock at $1,144.25.







Do you think MicroStrategy’s premium will make sense in the future as Bitcoin continues to gain mainstream adoption? Let us know in the comments below.

Ethereum: Security or not, BlackRock CEO confident in ETH ETF approval - AMBCrypto



BlackRock CEO said Ethereum ETF approval is likely despite ETH designation.
Hopeful issuers are adding “staking” to ‘nudge the SEC.”

Blackrock’s Larry Fink’s recent take on Ethereum [ETH] ETF approval has many commentators speculating on possible outcomes.
In a recent interview with FOX Business, Larry Fink was asked if one can start an ETH ETF even if ETH is designated as “security.” To which he answered, 
“Yes, I think so.”
He added that ETH designation or categorization won’t harm ETF approval.
Fink’s revelation has sparked new speculation. 
ETH ETF approval in May
Nate Geraci of ETF Store reacted to Fink’s revelation on X (formerly Twitter) and shared his opinion; 
“Just reading b/w lines & speculating, sounds like SEC seriously trying to classify eth as security.  If so, tough to have optimism on May spot eth ETF approval. 
That said, Fink says SEC could still allow spot eth ETF post-security classification.”
Another source of confusion regarding the ETH ETF approval is the addition of “staking” in recent amendments by potential issuers. 
On 27th March, Fidelity amended its ETH ETF filing to include “staking” to users. The filing stated; 
“As a result of any staking activity in which the trust may engage, the trust expects to receive certain staking rewards of ether, which may be treated for federal income tax purposes as income to the trust.”
Like Fidelity, Grayscale’s ETH ETF filing included staking. 
However, these trends are confusing given the SEC’s stance on staking, as seen during the Kraken lawsuit in 2023. 
During the Kraken fine, the SEC warned that,
“When investors provide tokens to staking-as-a-service providers, they lose control of those tokens and take on risks associated with those platforms, with very little protection.”
Bloomberg ETF analyst Eric Balchunas claimed that the reason hopeful issuers are adding staking on the filing is to,
“To nudge the SEC, hope squeaky wheel gets grease. And, I respect the hustle but I just think SEC’s mind is decided on this.”
The Bloomberg ETF analyst has maintained a pessimistic 25% odd of May approval for ETH ETFs. 
However, Fink’s positive inclination toward approval, even if ETH is classified as a “security,” is worth noting. If Fink’s stance pans out, we might eventually have an ETH ETF either way.

The Bulls Are Back: Spot Bitcoin Inflows Surge With New Records


                            Bitcoin bulls look to be firmly back in the driver’s seat following weeks of seeing BTC suffer a bearish sentiment with its price dips. The current bullish outlook for the flagship crypto is evident in the fact that the Spot Bitcoin ETFs are again recording an impressive amount of inflows. 
Spot Bitcoin ETFs Record $243 Million In Inflows
Farside Investors revealed in an X (formerly Twitter) post that the Spot Bitcoin ETFs recorded $243 million in inflows on March 27. This record was primarily thanks to BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) and the ARK 21Shares’ Bitcoin ETF (ARKB), which saw individual inflows of $323.8 million and $200.7 million, respectively. 

These inflows were enough to overshadow the $299.8 million that Grayscale’s Bitcoin ETF GBTC recorded on the day. Meanwhile, this marks the third consecutive day that these Spot Bitcoin ETFs have recorded net inflows, having seen net outflows throughout last week. These funds recorded an inflow of $418 million and $15.4 million on March 26 and 25, respectively. 
This is undoubtedly a welcome development for the crypto community, considering that analysts at JPMorgan already predicted that the wave of profit-taking from the BTC ETFs could last until Halving. Therefore, seeing sustained inflows into these ETFs could mean that the sentiment among these ETF investors has changed. 
Irrespective of the current outlook for these ETFs, there is reason to be confident about their future trajectory and how much funds could still flow into the Bitcoin ecosystem. Matt Hougan, the Chief Investment Officer (CIO) at Bitwise, recently suggested that the demand for these Bitcoin ETFs is far from its peak. That means that these funds could still witness an astonishing amount of inflows.
BTC Still Primed For More Upside Move Before Halving
The current bullish sentiment towards BTC suggests that the flagship crypto move could see further moves to the upside before the Halving event in mid-April. Besides the Spot Bitcoin ETFs, which are back to recording net inflows, other fundamentals hint at a price surge for BTC soon enough. 

NewsBTC recently reported that the supply of BTC on centralized exchanges (CEX) has been declining lately, which means that the sell pressure for the crypto token has reduced significantly. With Bitcoin whales cooling off on selling, that leaves room for BTC to embark on an upward trend. 
At the time of writing, BTC is trading at around $70,300, up in the last 24 hours according to data from CoinMarketCap.

Crypto Crackdown: US, UK Zero In On Hamas Funds In Gaza


								In a synchronized move aimed at disrupting the financial infrastructure backing Hamas, the United States and the United Kingdom have taken decisive action by imposing sanctions on Gaza Now, an internet-based media platform allegedly involved in financing the militant group.
The focal point of these sanctions is directed towards Mustafa Ayash, the mastermind behind Gaza Now, alongside various individuals and entities connected to the organization’s fundraising endeavors.
The decision to implement these measures stemmed from an extensive inquiry into Gaza Now’s fundraising initiatives subsequent to the occurrence of an assault in Israel on October 7th.
Cryptocurrency In Terrorism Financing



To address the challenges posed by the limited use of cryptocurrencies in terrorist financing, there is a growing recognition for a reevaluation of strategies and tools in combatting terrorism financing.
Authorities and regulatory bodies must enhance monitoring capabilities and establish more effective regulatory mechanisms within the digital currency space.

The preference for specific cryptocurrencies, such as Tether on the TRON blockchain, is driven by attributes like low transaction fees and perceived anonymity, highlighting the complexities faced in countering terrorism financing in the digital age.
The sanctions imposed by the US and UK form part of a wider international approach to counter the financing of terrorism. Both countries’ Treasury Departments emphasize the importance of global collaboration in addressing these issues.
In addition to the sanctions, the UK has implemented a comprehensive asset freeze on individuals and entities associated with Gaza Now to reinforce the principle that the financial system should not be exploited for terrorist activities.

The sanctions imposed on Gaza Now and its affiliates demonstrate a firm stance against entities involved in financing terrorism. The US and UK aim to disrupt the financial networks supporting Hamas through these measures, thereby weakening their operations and capabilities. The sanctions serve as a clear message that any attempt to exploit the financial system for illicit activities will face severe consequences.

In countering terrorism financing in the digital age, specific challenges arise, including the anonymity of cryptocurrencies, the lack of regulatory frameworks, the proliferation of cryptocurrency exchanges, the use of privacy-focused cryptocurrencies, sophisticated money laundering techniques, and the need for collaboration and information sharing.
Gaza Groups Raise Over $130 Million In Crypto Since 2021
Since at least 2019, Hamas and Palestinian Islamic Jihad (PIJ) have made an effort to raise money through cryptocurrencies in an effort to obtain funds outside of the most popular means of financial transfers. Restrictions on access to the international banking system result from the groups’ designation as terrorist organizations in Israel, the US, and other Western countries.
According to estimates, since 2021, terrorist organizations in Gaza have raised over $130 million in cryptocurrencies, with $41 million coming from Hamas and $93 million from Palestinian Islamic Jihad.
Defence Minister Yoav Gallant has disclosed that Iran provides the lion’s share of international money to the terror groups operating in Gaza. The country has financed the PIJ with tens of millions of dollars annually and Hamas with about $100 million each year.

Nansen integrates blockchain data from SportFi chain Chiliz and Ethereum rollup zkSync

Cryptocurrency users looking for the latest “alpha” in SportFi and zero-knowledge rollups can keep close tabs on data and insights from blockchain Chiliz and Ethereum layer 2 zkSync through new integrations on Nansen.The blockchain analytics platform announced the integration of the two different protocols on March 28, unlocking on-chain data analytics and insights for its users. Nansen data journalist Martin Lee told Cointelegraph that the integration provides a high-level overview of both ecosystems, allowing cryptocurrency teams to run their own queries and get insights from the raw data itself via Nansen query:“Users can gain insights into the daily active users and transactions on the chain, as well as which entities and protocols are seeing the most usage via the macro dashboard.”The functionality will unlock data insights into Chiliz, the proprietary blockchain powering scores of fan tokens licensed by high-profile sports teams and organizations worldwide that operate on the Socios platform.Related: Man and machine: Nansen’s analytics slowly labeling worldwide walletsChiliz and Socios CEO Alexandre Dreyfus says the collaboration will deepen the understanding of the Chiliz ecosystem and potentially drive user adoption and growth of the SportFi ecosystem:“Having Chiliz Chain on Nansen is a critical step to grow the ecosystem and help developers and industry stakeholders to start looking at Chiliz at a legitimate layer-1 with a very long-term vision.”According to data from CoinMarketCap, the Chiliz blockchain has a total market capitalization of $1.2 billion.

The Bitcoin halving is just weeks away - here’s how miners have prepared - Blockworks


Mining companies are bracing themselves for the Bitcoin halving — a time expected to weed out the segment’s less efficient operators, and those with trouble accessing capital.
Per-block mining rewards are set to drop from 6.25 bitcoin (BTC) to 3.125 BTC on or around April 20. Such an event occurs roughly every four years.  
Read more: The next Bitcoin halving is coming. Here’s what you need to know
While some industry players are expected to struggle, other firms have made it clear they intend to take advantage of buying opportunities and set themselves up for future growth.
Such vision takes preparation, and miner moves have been aplenty in recent months.
While some miners have already started acquiring properties, others have focused on buying new and more efficient machines. Cutting costs and diversifying revenue sources has been another strategy used by various companies.
Let’s take a deeper look.
Acquiring sites
While a bunch of the larger mining companies have signaled the intent to be opportunistic in a post-halving world, some have already started to buy properties.
Compass Point research and trading analyst Joe Flynn has referred to Marathon Digital as “the 800-pound gorilla” in the mining space. Indeed, the company sported an energized hash rate of 28.7 exahashes per second (EH/s) as of Feb. 29, and has no plans to slow down. 
The company closed its acquisition of two mining facilities in Texas and Nebraska in January. Marathon more recently revealed its intent to buy a Texas bitcoin mining facility owned by Applied Digital for roughly $87 million.
CleanSpark has also bought facilities this year — completing its acquisition of three data centers in Mississippi last month.
The purchases — as part of a $19.8 million cash deal — were set to expand CleanSpark’s operating hash rate by 2.4 EH/s.
Bitfarms bought land in Yguazu, Paraguay in January for a planned 100 megawatt (MW) facility. Near the Itaipú Dam, the facility — to boost Bitfarms’ portfolio of “low-cost renewable hydropower” — is set to be completed in the second half of 2024, the company said at the time. 
Refreshing machine fleets
Buying mining machines was a trend in 2023, as a dozen or so public mining companies committed more than $1 billion in purchase orders, according to BlocksBridge Consulting data.
Read more: Crypto miners keep busy ahead of halving with accelerated machine buys
Among the larger purchases was Riot Platforms’ buy of 66,560 MicroBT machines for $290.5 million in December — amounting to 18 EH/s of mining capacity.
Riot then bought 31,500 more miners from MicroBT last month, for $97.4 million. About 17,000 of those machines were set to replace “under-performing” miners in its Rockdale, TX facility, Riot CEO Jason Les said at the time.
Others have followed suit with acquiring and deploying new machines that improve the company’s mining efficiency.
Bitfarms revealed in November it had ordered 35,888 Bitmain T21 miners as part of a so-called “transformative fleet upgrade” — with deliveries slated between March and May.
The company then agreed to buy nearly 52,000 more machines earlier this month.
“Securing these miners now is a key part of our strategy to drive rapid and meaningful improvements across our three key operating metrics of hashrate, energy efficiency and operating costs per terahash with a plan to capture greater upside from rising bitcoin prices with rapidly expanding mining margins,” Bitfarms CEO Geoff Morphy said in a statement.
The latest Bitfarms purchase came just days after the company said it planned to sell common shares of the company to gain proceeds of up to $375 million.
Bitmain agreed to invest $53 million in Core Scientific in September ahead of Core’s emergence out of bankruptcy in January. That Bitmain deal was set to supply the mining company with 27,000 Bitmain S19J bitcoin mining servers — totaling 4.1 EH/s of hash rate. 
Core Scientific said earlier this month that it completed the payments due in 2024 for its S19J and S21 machines.
CleanSpark bought 4.4 EH/s worth of Antminer machines in October, while New York-based Cipher Mining purchased 16,700 Avalon A1466 miners from Canaan in January. 
Most recently, Singapore-headquartered Bitdeer said Tuesday it was set to install new SEALMINER A1 miners as part of an initial 3.4 EH/s expansion in Texas and Norway. The company said it would be retiring older mining rigs as part of the upgrade.
Cost-cutting and diversifying revenues
While growth is critical, not all miners are seeking to expand at all costs. Just ask Hut 8. 
The company merged with US Bitcoin Corp. in November. It then named US Bitcoin Corp. co-founder Asher Genoot as Hut 8’s new CEO, replacing Jaime Leverton.
Hut 8 said earlier this month it would cease mining operations at its Drumheller site in Alberta, Canada as part of a larger effort to cut inefficiencies. 
“I’m going through not just every single facility, every single category of miners and every single business line, but also every single cost center,” Genoot previously told Blockworks.
Read more: Hut 8 eyes growth around the Bitcoin halving — but not at all costs
Diversifying revenue streams, as well as exploring new geographies, has also been a focus for some segment players. 
Miners have increasingly looked to support the high-performance computing (HPC) and AI sectors. 
Hive Digital Technologies rebranded last July as part of a pivot to HPC, while Hut 8 has said it also plans to boost its footprint in the growing AI infrastructure and computing markets in the coming years.  
Earlier this month, Core Scientific said it would lease up to 16 MW of capacity in its Austin data center to cloud provider CoreWeave. Possible revenue via the CoreWeave deal exceeds $100 million, the company said. 
Geographic diversity is also a way some miners have looked to gain an edge.
Marathon Digital expanded into Abu Dhabi and Paraguay last year — and signaled it is looking into Africa as another possible spot to set up operations.
Charlie Schumacher, Marathon’s vice president of corporate communications, previously told Blockworks that expanding into new regions can help improve margins and reduce concentration risk in the business.
Looking ahead
The big public miners have noted that building up balance sheet strength has been crucial as executives expect there to be more buying opportunities post-halving.
Ultimately, segment observers note that bitcoin miner consolidation appears imminent. 
Marathon executives said during a February earnings call they would look to use the firm’s balance sheet — with roughly $1 billion worth of unrestricted cash and bitcoin, as of Jan. 31  — to nearly double the firm’s hash rate to 50 EH/s by the end of 2025.

Riot Platforms ended 2023 with $597 million in cash on its balance sheet, and held 8,067 BTC at the end of February — worth roughly $550 million.
The company intends to use that capital to help it reach 38 EH/s by the end of 2025, Riot executives note.
Core Scientific CEO Adam Sullivan told Blockworks that the company is set to focus on opportunistically buying machines from struggling miners unable to afford parts of their existing orders after the halving.
Read more: Core Scientific CEO: Machine buys, deleveraging key around Bitcoin halving
While Hut 8’s Genoot said the firm will look to invest in growth going forward, its decision to build scale or buy scale will depend in part on cost. 
The company’s recently announced 63 MW build-out in Texas was expected to cost $275,000 per megawatt — roughly 40% less than the roughly $460,000 per megawatt that Marathon spent on two mining facilities in December. 
“We’re very active in the M&A markets, but we’re also very cost-conscious,” Genoot said previously. “We’re not going to overpay because we know what the cost is to develop ourselves as well, so we’re running both in parallel very aggressively.”

Floki Inu price prediction after $2 billion added in a month


A common feature of cryptocurrency bull markets is the emergence – and resurgence – of various meme coins and the associated rags-to-riches and riches-to-rags stories.
The ongoing crypto market surge is no different and has already featured a massive meme coin rally early in March in which the internet-joke-based cryptocurrencies briefly dominate the weekly charts. 
It also saw the release of multiple new meme coins and the creation of several new millionaires out of investors who timed their trades particularly well with some of the most notable examples being associated with Dogwifhat (WIF) and the mishap-ridden Slerf (SLERF).


One of the mainstays of the lineup, however, the viking dog-themed and Elon Musk-inspired Floki Inu (FLOKI) has, in many ways, been the start of recent weeks. 
The token, which tries to differentiate itself from the crowd with various Web3 projects including those linked to non-fungible tokens (NFTs), games, and educational platforms, has been experiencing a massive and protracted surge in the last 30 days. 
On February 27, Floki Inu’s market cap stood at just under $475 million, and, by press time on March 28, it skyrocketed to $2.465 billion – nearly $2 billion in one month.

FLOKI’s surge initially took off on March 2 after the proposal to burn approximately 190 billion tokens – about 2% of the circulating supply – was approved by the community.

Along with the staggering market cap rise, the price of Floki Inu tokens also skyrocketed in the last 30 days. Within the time frame, FLOKI rose 426.60% from approximately $0.00004533 to $0.0002508.

The 30-day surge even briefly saw Floki Inu strive to surpass its old all-time highs above $0.00031 in 2021 near mid-March, but the token retraced since. 
Still, Floki Inu’s ultimate potential upside is difficult to predict as it already broke above its established first resistance level of $0.000240, is trading close to its second resistance of $0.000254, and has proven its ability to break above the third resistance at $0.000262, though it couldn’t maintain the high level.
Nonetheless, despite the correction, FLOKI’s uptrend remains strong and it is 10.85% in the green on the weekly chart. The latest 24 hours of trading were also positive for the token as it is 12.35% in the green in the time frame.
The performance indicates that the current trend – likely to be bolstered in April by the ripple effects of the Bitcoin (BTC) halving – might prove strong enough for FLOKI to surge significantly above its old highs.
Longer-term, Floki Inu has also been doing well – much like most other cryptocurrencies – and has surged 615.87% year-to-date (YTD) and is up just over 700% in the last 52 weeks.

Kerrisdale Capital Is Short MicroStrategy Stock, Long Bitcoin: 'Things Have Gotten Carried Away' - MicroStrategy (NASDAQ:MSTR) - Benzinga

Short-selling investment firm Kerrisdale Capital has MicroStrategy Inc MSTR in its crosshairs. The short seller released a bearish report on the stock Thursday and announced a short position as part of a pair trade.What To Know:  MicroStrategy serves as a proxy for Bitcoin BTC/USD. The recent boom in crypto markets helped spark a more than 200% rally in MicroStrategy stock since the start of the year. Kerrisdale Capital believes the move higher is overdone. “We are long bitcoin and short shares of MicroStrategy, a proxy for bitcoin which trades at an unjustifiable premium to the digital asset that drives its value. Shares of MicroStrategy have soared amid a recent rise in the price of bitcoin but, as is often the case with crypto, things have gotten carried away,” the short seller said.Kerrisdale Capital claims that bitcoin would need to be trading at $177,000 right now in order to justify the current valuation of MicroStrategy.Benzinga reached out to MicroStrategy for comment, but the company did not immediately respond.MicroStrategy stock used to offer investors a unique way to gain access to bitcoin, but the asset is now easily obtainable, especially given the recent approval of several spot bitcoin ETFs, the short seller said. “MicroStrategy's trading history and basic common sense suggests the current inflated premium will contract, much as it has on prior occasions, providing a compelling opportunity for a pair trade,” Kerrisdale said in the report.Related Link: BlackRock’s Bitcoin Bet Pays Off As IBIT ETF Crushes Records, Leaves CEO Larry Fink ‘Pleasantly Surprised’Kerrisdale Capital made it clear that its thesis is not built on a bearish view of bitcoin or MicroStrategy by itself, rather that the relationship between the two has become distorted. MicroStrategy’s software analytics business only represents about 3% of the company’s total enterprise value and much of the bitcoin the company has acquired was paid for through debt financing and equity offerings, which has diluted shareholders. Kerrisdale claims that although MicroStrategy’s bitcoin holdings have increased, the amount of bitcoin per share has remained “virtually unchanged” in recent years. Other arguments for MicroStrategy’s premium include the ability to reinvest cash flows from the software business, lack of management fees, liquidity and ease of trading, but Kerrisdale believes all of those arguments are weak. MicroStrategy currently trades at a 2.6x equity premium to bitcoin, which is well above the historical average of 1.3x and even above the 2x premium it has been at or below on 94% of trading days since 2021, Kerrisdale said. “Assuming the premium to NAV reverts to more historically consistent averages implies a 50% return,” the short seller said.

FTX Hearing Started: Judge Cornered SBF! Here's What the Judge Said! - Bitcoin Sistemi

The cryptocurrency exchange FTX, which suddenly went bankrupt in November 2022, caused a major collapse in the market and investors suffered huge losses.
While FTX's bankruptcy had a shocking effect on the market, its founder Sam Bankman Fried was arrested. SBF, who has been detained since then, appeared before the judge again today regarding the charges against him.


According to information reported by Inner City Press, at the SBF hearing, Manhattan judge Lewis Kaplan stated that Sam Bankman-Fried lied to him several times during the case.
At that point, the judge said SBF lied when it claimed it had “no knowledge” that hedge fund Alameda was using FTX customer deposits until the fall of 2022.





Sam Bankman-Fried again said he was “sad” about what happened at today's hearing.
Here are the highlights of what Judge Lewis Kaplan said about SBF's defense:



“I reject the defense's claim regarding the loss, both in terms of law and facts.
The claim that customers and creditors will be paid in full is misleading.
SBF's crimes included the defendant SBF taking money from FTX customers to whom it had no right to do so.
A thief who takes what he steals to Las Vegas and successfully places a bet is not entitled to a sentence reduction, even if he pays back.
“We estimate that investors lost $1.7 billion, lenders lost $1.3 billion, and customers lost $8 billion following FTX's bankruptcy.”

Ethena Protocol announces the airdrop of the ENA token

Ethena, a high-performance protocol that leverages the concept of synthetic dollar, has just announced the launch of its governance token ENA, which will be distributed to its community through an airdrop.
Anyone who has participated in the incentive campaign and has farmed “shards” is eligible to redeem the cryptocurrency, which will be available from April 2nd.
Let’s see below how Ethena works and the details of the inauguration of the new token.

Ethena: what is this $1.4 billion yield protocol?
Ethena is a yield protocol, which introduced for the first time in the history of DeFi the concept of synthetic dollar with the digital resource USDe, with which returns are generated from innovative hedging strategies and from Ethereum staking.
Ethena is betting everything on USDe, which represents the cornerstone currency of the project, built to be scalable, stable, and resistant to censorship.
It is an algorithmic stablecoin, which maintains its peg through a sophisticated delta-hedging mechanism with collateral in ETH.
The protocol, thanks to its stablecoin, offers an investment tool called “Internet Bond”, which provides a 10% yield to USDe holders, composed of the returns from liquid stakes in Ethereum staking, combined with the activity of arbitrage of the funding rate in derivatives of the same currency.
The LST resources that Ethena invests in are: stETH, cbETH, rETH, WBETH, fxsETH, and BETH.The platforms where it goes to do short hedging for each collateral position in ETH are Gmx, Dydx, Binance, Okx, Deribit, Bybit, Bitmex, Synthetix, Bitfinex, and others.

We underline that short hedging is carried out using 1X leverage and serves to support the peg of the stablecoin in case ETH were to lose value too quickly.
If indeed the price of ETH falls, short positions become profitable, causing the peg stand to compensate for the erosion of the cryptocurrency.
This mechanism helps the financial stability of Ethena, which, although not exempt from major systemic implosion risks, can be considered “safer” than the Terra/Luna ecosystem (which fell into disgrace precisely because of its algorithmic component).

From a practical point of view, users can mint USDe simply by depositing staked Ethereum (stETH), without any lock-up constraints.
Subsequently, by staking USDe for sUSDe, users are able to effectively take advantage of the yield promised by the protocol. This kind of  “Token Vault” model ensures that the staked USDe generate a yield by automatically compounding profits.
The innovation introduced by Ethena and its high profitability have allowed the protocol to grow significantly in recent months, reaching a total of over 100,000 active users and a TVL of 1.37 billion dollars, which corresponds to the supply of its stablecoin.
Obviously the intrinsic risks presented by Ethena are blatantly evident: it will be interesting to see if the protocol will be able to survive even in bear market conditions, or if it will meet the same fate as other similar ones that have tried in vain to beat the benchmark with promises of overly optimistic returns.

Ethena (ENA) token launch set for April 2nd with accompanying airdrop: check your eligibility
The strong attractiveness of Ethena that allowed the platform to attract billions of dollars in capital, is not only due exclusively to the high yield offered but also to the airdrop campaign that the protocol is carrying out and which is now almost coming to an end.
Yesterday in fact Ethena Labs announced the launch of their governance token ENA, with a distribution through airdrop scheduled for April 2nd.
Everyone who has supported the protocol up to now, by staking USDe and participating in the “shards” campaign, is eligible to redeem a portion of the 750 million ENA tokens put up for grabs by the project team.
This represents 5% of the total supply of the new cryptocurrency, which amounts to 15 billion tokens. Initially, the circulating supply launched on the market will be 1.425 billion tokens.
We expect a market capitalization of about 1 billion dollars at launch, which translates to a likely price of 0.70 per ENA.

To check their eligibility, users can visit the website claim.ethena.fi, currently inaccessible but will be open the day before the airdrop distribution.
It will be possible to claim for the next 30 days; all unclaimed tokens will then be used in a second season of incentives or reassigned to other eligible users.
Meanwhile, it is important to emphasize that those who unlock or sell all their USDe before the date of April 2nd, will lose the associated rewards.As clearly described in the blog post announcing the launch of the ENA token:
“Any user who completely exits any of the incentivized pools by selling the system before the end of the shard campaign will lose all their shards. If you have repositioned between USDe, sUSDe, LP pool or Pendle, you will still receive your shards.”
It should also be noted that the first 2000 wallets by shard number will have 50% of the airdrop locked in vesting for a period of 6 months, with the other 50% sellable immediately.
All other users will not have any blocking constraints.

Ethena Labs announces 750 million ENA airdrop for its community - CoinJournal



                    

                    
Ethena Labs has announced that the ENA airdrop is set for April 2, with trading on exchanges also open.
Eligible Shard Campaign participants will be airdropped tokens amounting to 750 million, or 5% of ENA supply.

Ethena Labs is set to mark the next step in its decentralization with one of the biggest airdrops in the crypto market.
The Ethena Labs team announced that the highly anticipated ENA token airdrop happens next week, on April 2. Trading on crypto exchanges also opens on the day.
Per the update, the DeFi protocol’s community will receive a distribution of 750 ENA tokens, which represent 5% of the total supply of 15 million ENA tokens.
ENA distribution follows Ethena’s mainnet launch in February and marks the end of the project’s “Shard Campaign”. 
Users’ engagement and accumulation of “shards” ends on April 1, allowing the community to claim ENA tokens from April 2.
ENA airdrop: Who’s eligible?
According to an announcement from Ethena Labs, airdrop eligibility will be pegged on users’ shards accumulation up to the snapshot date on April 1. During this program, the USDe stablecoin’s supply rose to over $1.38 billion.
Participants must have held onto their staked USDe to qualify. Unstaking or selling USDe before this date will see participants become ineligible for the ENA airdrop.
However, following an exploit on DeFi protocol Prisma Finance, a “21 day lock on the mkUSD<>USDe pool on Ethena” was lifted. The exploit on Prisma on Thursday saw more than $10 million in assets stolen and the Ethena team acknowledged the need to allow users immediately withdraw their funds.
“Users will not lose any shards or accrued rewards for withdrawing from this pool,” Ethena Labs posted on X.

We are aware of the ongoing issues with our friends at @PrismaFi
The 21 day lock on the mkUSD<>USDe pool on Ethena has been lifted with immediate effect so users can withdraw as required
Users will not lose any shards or accrued rewards for withdrawing from this pool https://t.co/NEGXegqMVp
— Ethena Labs (@ethena_labs) March 28, 2024

Notably, the top 2,000 wallets eligible for the airdrop will receive 50% of their allocation and have the other 50% subject to a 6-month vesting schedule.
The remaining wallets, which are currently eligible for smaller allocations, are set to enjoy the full liquidity of airdropped tokens starting April 2.

Degen Chain Debuts on Base as 'Blockchain Equivalent of Las Vegas' - Decrypt

One of the most active and fastest-growing communities in the Farcaster ecosystem is getting its own layer-3 blockchain. The Degen chain was announced today by pseudonymous founder Jacek and infrastructure provider Syndicate, debuting with its native gas token DEGEN, touted as “one of the first community tokens with its own L3.”The Degen movement launched in January with a channel on Farcaster, a decentralized and blockchain-based social network on Base, the Ethereum layer-2 incubated by Coinbase. Frequently positioned as a crypto-friendly alternative to Twitter, Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin is a Farcaster fan, and the release of Farcaster Frames in February made it especially attractive to software developers.Since token claims opened in January, 53,000 DEGEN holders have already made over 553,000 transactions, Syndicate said, mostly tipped as a reward for posting quality content. A dedicated Degen blockchain was the next logical step.“It’s designed to be a vibrant playground for developers and a gateway for users to safely experiment with their funds,” Jacek told Decrypt. “Picture it as the blockchain equivalent of Las Vegas—less about gambling, more about the thrill of exploration and fun.”With Degen chain, crypto developers can tinker with various community management and engagement models, including tipping, community rewards, payments, and gaming.Designed as an “ultra low cost” layer-3, the Degen chain uses Arbitrum's Orbit architecture, its affiliated AnyTrust protocol to ensure data availability, and the Ethereum layer-2 Base—released by exchange giant Coinbase last fall—to settle transactions.Syndicate cofounder Will Papper said he was excited to work on a community-centric blockchain and provide “all of the tools and infrastructure to not only make the chain easy-to-use but also unlock new capabilities.”“Layer 3s are the next frontier for fully on-chain experiences, games, and applications,” Papper said. “We can't wait to see all of the new things that can only be developed on an L3 with Degen chain.”Syndicate is also tapping its experience with layer-3 infrastructure technologies ranging from Conduit for transaction rollups, Decent for the bridge, and Airstack APIs. The company also unveiled its Frame L3 for Farcaster developers last month. With the launch of Degen chain, the company is offering a free plan to allow developers to test drive the tech stack.Jacek said the point is to have fun, not to take tokens to the moon.“Whether returning with gains or not, the key is the enriching experience and connections made along the way,” he said.Stay on top of crypto news, get daily updates in your inbox.

Hedgeye Claims Reddit is 'Grossly Overvalued', Insiders Sell Shares After IPO - Tokenist


					
Neither the author, Tim Fries, nor this website, The Tokenist, provide financial advice. Please consult our website policy prior to making financial decisions.



Reddit Inc. (NYSE: RDDT) has made headlines since its blockbuster IPO, but only some of the attention has been positive. The social media giant’s stock has experienced significant volatility, with insider trading and overvaluation concerns taking center stage. As top executives, including CEO Steve Huffman, CFO Andrew Vollero, and CTO Christopher Slowe, sell substantial amounts of stock, questions arise about the company’s future performance.



Meanwhile, Hedgeye Risk Management has labeled Reddit as a potential short idea, suggesting that the stock is grossly overvalued and could face a 50% downside. As the market digests these developments, Reddit’s stock price has dropped 7.74% to $53.28 at 9:36 a.m. EDT.



Reddit Stock Sees Significant Insider Trading After Blockbuster IPO



Reddit’s top executives have engaged in significant stock transactions since the social media firm’s public debut, with CEO and President Steve Huffman leading the charge.



Huffman sold 500,000 shares at an average price of $32.30, resulting in a transaction valued at approximately $16.15 million. Following the sale, Huffman directly owned 710,306 shares, indicating that the transaction represented about 41.3% of his total holdings.



Chief Financial Officer Andrew Vollero and Chief Technology Officer Christopher Slowe also participated in the selling spree. Vollero offloaded 71,765 shares at the same average price as Huffman, generating roughly $2.32 million from the sale.



After the transaction, Vollero retained 681,660 shares directly, marking the sale as approximately 9.5% of his total shares. Meanwhile, Slowe sold 185,000 shares at $32.30 each, totaling approximately $5.98 million, representing a significant portion of his combined direct and indirect holdings of 443,752 shares.



On the buying side, Chief Accounting Officer Michelle Marie Reynolds and Director Robert A. Sauerberg made notable purchases. Reynolds acquired 3,000 shares at $34 each, totaling $102,000, which adjusted her direct holdings to 96,413 shares. Sauerberg also invested an additional $340,000 in Reddit, purchasing 10,000 shares at $34 each, bringing his post-transaction direct and indirect holdings to 57,087 shares.





Hedgeye Names Reddit as a Short Idea, States Stock is “Grossly Overvalued”



Hedgeye Risk Management has identified Reddit Inc. as a potential short idea, suggesting the stock could face a significant downside of approximately 50%. In a recently released report, the firm characterized Reddit’s stock as “grossly overvalued” and argued that it should trade closer to its initial public offering (IPO) price of $34.



Hedgeye analyst Andrew Freedman expressed concerns about Reddit’s future performance despite the stock’s initial positive trajectory following its IPO. Freedman pointed to the potential for revenue and user growth deceleration in the latter half of 2024 and the first half of 2025 as key factors contributing to the firm’s bearish outlook on the social media platform’s stock.



Reddit Inc. saw a significant drop in its stock price, with shares trading at $53.28 as of 9:36 a.m. EDT, down $4.47 or 7.74% from the previous close.

Trader Turns Bullish on Altcoin Amid Breakout of Accumulation Range, Maps Path Forward for Sei and Gala - The Daily Hodl


								A widely followed cryptocurrency analyst and trader is expressing bullish sentiment on a top-30 altcoin by market cap.
The trader pseudonymously known as Altcoin Sherpa tells his 212,600 followers on the social media platform X that Internet Computer (ICP), a blockchain project whose aim is to replicate the internet’s speed, power and scale on decentralized networks, appears to have completed a consolidation period that begun earlier in the year.










“ICP: This looks like it’s finished its multi-week accumulation period, it’s time to go.
This is one to actively trade for the next few weeks in my opinion.”
Source: Altcoin Sherpa/X
ICP is trading at $19.40 at time of writing, up by around 72% in seven days.
Next up is the layer-one blockchain Sei (SEI). Altcoin Sherpa says that he expects SEI to continue trading in a range that started forming 83 days ago.
“SEI: Nearly three months in this trading range with some deviations to the upside. Expecting more chop on this one for a bit.”
Source: Altcoin Sherpa/X
SEI is trading at $0.845 at time of writing.
Next up is the native token of the Gala (GALA) blockchain gaming platform. Altcoin Sherpa says that GALA, which is 92% below its all-time high price of $0.825 reached in November of 2021, presents an attractive upside opportunity.
According to Altcoin Sherpa, the risk-reward ratio of Gala is “not bad”.
“GALA: Some of these coins have a long way to go to former all-time highs. Not saying they’re going to get anywhere close to it but the upside is definitely good if these projects still have some money in the bank + catalysts + kept building in the bear market.”

GALA is trading at $0.065 at time of writing.
