Crypto Whales Push Tellor (TRB) Price and Market Cap in May


In May, Tellor (TRB), a decentralized oracle network, significantly outperformed expectations, doubling its market capitalization early in the month. As of April 30, TRB’s market value was $143.32 million. By the morning of May 7, in Asia market hours, this figure had surged to an impressive $247.81 million.
This substantial growth aligns with a noted increase in crypto whale activity. Furthermore, it suggests a wave of profit-taking may influence the market dynamics.
Unpacking the Surge in Tellor’s Market Capitalization
Data from the blockchain analytics platform Santiment revealed a spike in crypto whales’ transactions and active addresses involving TRB. Specifically, on May 6, there were 212 daily active addresses, and whale transactions exceeded $100,000, totaling 16. 
This starkly contrasts with May 1, which saw only 131 active addresses and no significant crypto whale transactions. However, this activity indicates a growing investor interest and potential for profit-taking from TRB.

Despite this, crypto analysts remain optimistic about TRB’s price trajectory. Analyst Javon Marks, highlighting Tellor’s market strength, anticipates a continued upward trend.


“TRB (Tellor) is now starting to display major strength after holding a bullish pattern and can still be getting ready for a massive, [above] 315% move back to [over] $261,” Marks commented.

He then reiterated his positive outlook, highlighting the responsiveness of TRB prices to recent patterns. This optimistic analysis is further supported by the technical patterns observed. The formation of higher lows in price action coupled with lower lows on the momentum oscillator suggests a bullish continuation for TRB.

Bitcoin Parabola Becoming Obvious As BTC Indicators Flip Bullish, Says Crypto Trader - Here’s His Outlook - The Daily Hodl


								A popular crypto trader thinks that the most recent correction allowed Bitcoin (BTC) to solidify the final base of its multi-month parabolic ascent.
Analyst Kevin Svenson tells his 144,300 followers on the social media platform X that Bitcoin may have just completed base four of its parabolic curve pattern.










The crypto strategist shares a chart indicating that Bitcoin is now poised to rally to the pattern’s price target of $90,000.
“BITCOIN | Parabolic Trend 
Now entering the stage where the parabola becomes obvious.
I’ve been screaming from the rooftops about this potential for the past year. Here we are. It’s real.” 
Source: Kevin Svenson/X
Svenson’s stance on Bitcoin comes as he says two momentum indicators have flipped bullish for BTC. According to the analyst, Bitcoin’s moving average convergence divergence (MACD) and relative strength index (RSI) indicators on the daily chart have swung to the side of BTC bulls.
“BITCOIN | Daily Chart | MACD + RSI
BTC’s first positive MACD in 50+ Days.
BTC broke above the 65+ day RSI downtrend.
The picture is certainly shifting here.” 
Source: Kevin Svenson/X
Svenson takes his bullish outlook on BTC a step further, saying that Bitcoin’s bull market will not end once the crypto king hits $90,000.
“People jump to the conclusion that this is my bull cycle prediction. They assume $90,000 is my cycle peak target. That is not the case…
I do expect a major correction after $90,000, but we are still very early in this cycle. The BTC halving JUST happened. There will be a lot more action after this.”
At time of writing, Bitcoin is trading for $63,711.

Truflation chooses Chainlink's crypto standard for altcoins

Truflation, independent and impartial provider of verifiable economic data, has chosen the Chainlink CCIP crypto standard, dedicated to facilitating cross-chain transfers of altcoins. 
Thanks to the integration, the native TRUF token can now be transferred between the main networks of Arbitrum, Base, and Ethereum. 

Chainlink CCIP: the crypto standard for cross-chain transfers of altcoins is integrated into Truflation
Chainlink has announced that its CCIP standard has just been chosen and integrated into the Truflation crypto project, to facilitate cross-chain payments of its native token TRUF.

“@truflation has integrated #Chainlink CCIP into @arbitrum, @base, and @ethereum to power TRUF transfers across chains. Truflation, a member of Chainlink BUILD, is deepening its integration with Chainlink.”
Thanks to the integration of Chainlink CCIP, TRUF will be able to be exchanged through the main networks of Arbitrum, Base, and Ethereum. 
In its blog post, Truflation explains the reasons that led it to choose Chainlink as a partner for this cross-chain journey.
The crypto project, an independent and impartial provider of verifiable economic data, sees in CCIP an interoperability solution with proven experience in maintaining the highest security standards. 
Indeed, the Chainlink CCIP standard is supported by the Risk Management Network, a separate and independent network that continuously monitors and verifies cross-chain operations for suspicious activity.
This is an additional level of security that is particularly important, especially in light of the sector’s historical exploits and the billions of user funds lost due to insecure and unreliable cross-chain infrastructures.
Chainlink: the crypto project that offers cross-chain of altcoins with a high level of security 
Regarding the security of the Chainlink standard for cross-chain transfers of altcoins, Stefan Rust, CEO of Truflation, stated the following: 
“We are excited to integrate Chainlink CCIP to support TRUF transfers between chains with a level 5 security between chains. By making TRUF transfers safe and seamless, we can simplify the payment process, unlock new use cases, and allow more users to participate in our protocol in the multi-chain ecosystem.”
Not only that, Truflation wanted to emphasize how Chainlink CCIP is future-proof, built to support continuous updates. 
Among other things, Truflation lists the integration of new blockchains, the introduction of advanced features, and the addition of other approaches to defense in depth to security. 
With this setup, integrating Chainlink’s CCIP would also mean eliminating future change costs in case new cross-chain functionalities are needed. 
The +5% pump of TRUF in the last 24 hours
It seems that the new choice of Chainlink CCIP has been highly appreciated by TRUF investors. 
In the last 24 hours, TRUF has indeed recorded a price pump of +5.20%. At the time of writing, TRUF is worth 0.56$.
After all, in addition to the token, Truflation’s crypto project also seems to be well received in the crypto world. 
Last September 2023, in fact, the news had leaked that Coinbase had selected Truflation as one of the first six investments for the Base Ecosystem Fund. In practice, Truflation emerged among 800 candidates.
The project behind TRUF offers users unprecedented access to independent and verifiable data on prices in key sectors such as housing, employment, and transportation in the United States.

                        Public mining companies have reported decreases in Bitcoin production ranging from 6% to 12% for the month of April following the halving event. Major Bitcoin miners, including Bitfarms, Cipher, CleanSpark, Core Scientific, Riot, and Terawulf, were all affected, according to a report from The Miner Mag. However, the report said that the robust Bitcoin fee market briefly mitigated the impact of the halving on these companies.Hut 8 Reports 36% Decline in BTC Production
Hut 8, one of the prominent Bitcoin mining companies in North America, has reported a significant decline in its proprietary production for the month of April. In their monthly update released on Monday, Hut 8 disclosed that they mined 148 BTC with their proprietary mining fleet during April, marking a 36% decrease compared to March. This decrease resulted in a realized hashrate of 3.44 EH/s, a considerable drop of 51% from Hut 8’s peak of 6.27 EH/s in December following the merger with USBTC.While the halving event had its impact, Hut 8 attributed the decline in production primarily to the relocation of proprietary miners previously hosted in the Kearney and Granbury sites, which were purchased by Marathon in December. Marathon accelerated the process of vacating the tenants in February, leading to disruptions in Hut 8’s mining operations.Hut 8’s CEO, Asher Genoot, stated in the release that the team successfully removed over 25,000 miners on 440 pallets in just eight days during April, aiming to minimize downtime within the company’s fleet. Furthermore, he shared that the relocated Kearney and Granbury miners have found a new home at the Salt Creek site in Texas, which became operational within a remarkable three-month period since breaking ground. The Salt Creek site boasts a power capacity of 63 megawatts.Additionally, Hut 8 announced that its total self-mining, hosting, and managed power capacity expanded to over one gigawatt in April. This expansion was partially due to the energization of a 215-megawatt site in Ward County, Texas, on behalf of Ionic Digital. Ionic Digital emerged from the Chapter 11 bankruptcy case of Celsius, a significant development in Hut 8’s mining operations.Bitcoin Miners Adjust Operations After Halving
Bitcoin miners, including Riot Platforms, have been adjusting their operations after the halving event on April 20, which reduced mining rewards from 6.25 BTC to 3.125 BTC, equivalent to approximately $180,600 at presentAs reported, a notable outflow of Bitcoin from miners could be on the horizon in the months following the upcoming halving event.In a recent note, Markus Thielen, the head of research at 10x Research, estimated that Bitcoin miners have the potential to liquidate approximately $5 billion worth of BTC after the halving.Asset manager CoinShares analysis suggests that Riot, TeraWulf, and CleanSpark are among the best-positioned companies to weather the impending storm.

Mark Cuban Backs Dogecoin Co-Founder Billy Markus' 'S**t Posting' On X, Says 'Positive Trolling ... Is Never Silly' - Benzinga

Billionaire entrepreneur Mark Cuban has publicly supported the confession of Billy Markus, the co-founder of Dogecoin DOGE/USD.What Happened: Markus, who created the meme cryptocurrency Dogecoin in 2013, recently confessed on the X social media platform. Cuban, a well-known Dogecoin enthusiast, has shown his support for Markus’ actions.Markus, in his confession, addressed his activity on social media, particularly his engagement in “s**t posting” and complaining. Markus, also known by his pseudonym “Shibetoshi Nakamoto,” wrote, “i’m just s**tposting but my actual positon here is: 1) complaining about people complaining on social media is pretty silly 2) it’s cool when people do things to try to help fix really difficult problems 3) it’s perfectly fine to complain, like you’re literally doing.” Cuban, in response, expressed his support for Markus, emphasizing that “Positive trolling towards s**t posting trolls is never silly.’Despite withdrawing from the Dogecoin project over a decade ago, Markus still holds a small amount of DOGE and a minimal amount of Bitcoin.Cuban, who was previously a vocal critic of cryptocurrencies, has become a strong advocate for not only Dogecoin but also Bitcoin BTC/USD, Ethereum ETH/USD, and other leading cryptocurrencies.See Also: Despite Bitcoin Hitting $64K, Analyst Says King Crypto Remains In ‘Prime Buy Zone’Why It Matters: Cuban’s support for Dogecoin is not new. The billionaire has been a vocal advocate for the meme cryptocurrency and has even allowed the Dallas Mavericks to accept DOGE as payment for tickets and merchandise. Despite the recent surge in his crypto investments, Cuban’s support for Dogecoin and its community remains unwavering. His backing of Markus’ confession on X is likely to further bolster the confidence of Dogecoin investors and enthusiasts.Markus’ recent disclosure on X comes at a time when the social activity surrounding Bitcoin ETFs is reportedly on the decline, suggesting that retail investors may be losing interest in the cryptocurrency. Price Action: Dogecoin is currently trading at $0.16, marking a decrease of 0.45% in the last 24 hours, while showing a notable 68.86% increase year-to-date, according to the data from Benzinga Pro.Read Next: EcoAi Coin: A Sustainable Digital Token For A Greener PlanetImage Via FlickerThis content was partially produced with the help of Benzinga Neuro and was reviewed and published by Benzinga editors.

Polygon’s ZK-rollup Ethereum scaler Miden hits testnet

Ethereum layer-2 developer Polygon has launched an alpha version testnet of its latest zero-knowledge (ZK)-rollup solution called Miden as Ethereum scaling competition heats up.In a May 6 X post, Polygon said the Polygon Miden Alpha Testnet zero-knowledge was live for developers to begin testing. Miden is a ZK-rollup designed to extend the capabilities of the Ethereum blockchain.Polygon’s latest solution — like other ZK-rollups — uses a type of cryptography where data can be verified or “proved” without revealing what the data consists of to the rest of the network.Miden also has client-side proving, where users can “locally generate proofs for their own state transitions without having to disclose the state to the network,” Polygon explained. This aims to lower the burden on the network and improve privacy and scalability. Overview of the Miden network. Source: PolygonMiden also enables additional functionality such as private accounts enabling private tokens and transactions where only the hash of the account is stored on-chain.Miden also leverages parallel transaction execution — where transactions can be processed concurrently — enabling it to achieve a much higher throughput compared to the Ethereum mainnet and reduce blockchain node state bloat. Other planned key features include customizable smart contracts and customized node scripts where users will be able to write their own note scripts using the Miden virtual machine (VM) and programming languages such as Rust.According to the Miden roadmap, a builders testnet is scheduled for September. There is no mention of a mainnet launch timeframe.Related: Vitalik Buterin breaks down ‘Binius’ as a way to speed up zero-knowledge proofsMiden has entered a market in direct competition with StarkWare’s layer-2 scaling network and rollup tech stack StarkNet and other alternatives such as Matter Labs’ zkSync Era. Polygon also builds zkEVM a scaling solution equivalent to Ethereum Virtual Machine, allowing most existing smart contracts, tools, and wallets to work seamlessly.The blockchain’s native token Polygon (MATIC) did not react to the testnet launch falling 3.7% on the day to trade at $0.704 at the time of writing.

Marathon Digital Mints Massive Market Cap Gain: Up $800 Million


								Bitcoin mining company Marathon Digital (MARA) is basking in the glow of a successful week, with its stock price surging after inclusion in the prestigious S&P SmallCap 600 index and the announcement of a performance-based executive bonus plan. However, the company’s fortunes remain tethered to the ever-volatile Bitcoin price.

S&P Inclusion Boosts Visibility And Investor Confidence
The inclusion in the S&P SmallCap 600 index marks a significant milestone for Marathon Digital. This widely tracked index exposes the company to a broader pool of investors who base their investment decisions on index holdings.
The news triggered an 18% jump in Marathon Digital’s stock price, reaching $20.67 per share, according to Yahoo Finance data. This surge reflects investor confidence in the increased visibility and potential for more significant investments.
Being added to the S&P SmallCap 600 is a validation of Marathon Digital’s position as a leading player in the cryptocurrency mining industry. This inclusion will enhance the company’s standing and attract a new wave of investors seeking exposure to the Bitcoin mining space.
Source: YCharts
Executive Bonus Plan Aligns Interests With Shareholders
Adding to the positive momentum, Marathon Digital unveiled a new executive bonus plan directly linked to the company’s stock price performance. This strategic move aligns the interests of top executives, including CEO Fred Thiel, CFO Salman Khan, and General Counsel Zabi Nowaid, with those of shareholders.
Bonuses of up to nearly $33 million can only be awarded if the stock price performs well, incentivizing executives to make decisions that drive shareholder value.

Total crypto market cap currently at $2.282 trillion. Chart: TradingView
The executive bonus plan demonstrates the management team’s confidence in Marathon Digital’s future growth trajectory. Tying bonuses to stock price performance ensures that executives are focused on strategies that will benefit shareholders in the long run.
Bitcoin Price Volatility: A Double-Edged Sword
While the S&P inclusion and bonus plan are positive developments, Marathon’s fortunes remain intricately tied to the price of Bitcoin. The article mentions Bitcoin hovering around $63,200, with increased trading volume but a bearish trend over the past 24 hours. This volatility presents a double-edged sword for Marathon Digital.

A sustained rise in Bitcoin price would significantly benefit the company, as its mining operations become more profitable. However, a prolonged slump could put a damper on Marathon Digital’s growth prospects. Investors considering Marathon Digital as an investment should carefully consider their risk tolerance regarding Bitcoin’s price fluctuations.
Looking Ahead: Marathon Digital Charts A Growth Path
Despite the inherent risks associated with Bitcoin price swings, Marathon’s recent developments paint a promising picture for the company’s future. The S&P inclusion broadens its investor base, and the executive bonus plan incentivizes leadership to focus on shareholder value creation.
As the cryptocurrency mining industry continues to evolve, Marathon Digital is well-positioned to capitalize on growth opportunities, provided it can navigate the unpredictable tides of the Bitcoin market.

Cardano: Analyzing what's going wrong as ADA struggles in $0.45 range - AMBCrypto



ADA continued the stop-and-start price trend.
Active addresses increased slightly.

After experiencing a two-day downtrend, the recent uptrend in Cardano [ADA] would certainly be welcomed by holders. However, are there any metrics indicating a sustained run for ADA?
ADA sees a slight positive trend
AMBCrypto’s analysis Cardano’s price trend indicated a fluctuating pattern in recent days. 
The month began on a positive note with a three-day consecutive uptrend observed from the 1st to the 3rd of May, during which the price rose from around $0.45 to $0.46.
 However, these gains were followed by consecutive declines, bringing the price back to around $0.45. This trend of downtrends following uptrends has persisted, signaling a lack of sustained momentum. 
Source: TradingView
As of this writing, ADA was trading with a nearly 1% increase, returning to the $0.46 price zone. 
Despite this, it remained entrenched in a bear trend, as indicated by its Relative Strength Index (RSI) hovering just above 40. 
But the price chart suggests a potential death cross if ADA fails to sustain its uptrend. 
A death cross occurs when the long moving average (blue line) crosses above the short moving average (yellow line), typically signaling a negative price trend. 
As of this writing, the price was trending below the blue and yellow lines, underscoring the uncertainty in ADA’s price trajectory.
Cardano volume shows declining trading activity
Cardano’s volume does not provide encouraging signs. Analysis of the volume indicates a decline over the past few days. 
At the beginning of the month, the volume surged to over $400 million, briefly surpassing the $500 million mark. 
Source: Santiment
However, it has since declined. At press time, the volume stood at around $279 million. Typically, an increase in volume can drive price movements, reflecting heightened trading activity. 
Conversely, the current downward trend suggests a decrease in trading activity, which may hinder the potential for sustained positive momentum in ADA’s price.
Slight tick in Cardano active addresses 
AMBCrypto’s analysis further indicated a recent uptick in the seven-day Cardano active addresses metric.

Also, Santiment revealed that between 4th May and press time, the number of active addresses rose from around 159,000 to over 163,000. 
While this increase is notable, it appears insufficient to impact trading activity on the network significantly.

How long does it take to mine 1 Bitcoin?

                            What is Bitcoin mining?                                        Bitcoin mining is the network’s method of transaction validation. This process is also how new Bitcoin are added to the existing supply.There are currently around 19.5 million Bitcoin in circulation and the cryptocurrency is programmed to have a total supply of 21 million. The final 1.5 million or so are locked away, waiting for users with powerful computers to release them through Bitcoin mining.Bitcoin mining is like a digital treasure hunt. Armed with powerful computer hardware, miners search for a 64-digit hexadecimal code that validates a block of transactions. This code (also called a hash) is found through a process called hashing. Hashing requires computer hardware to sift through trillions of hashes to find one that matches a block’s difficulty (also called target hash). Once miners find a block’s target hash, they can verify its transactions are genuine and will issue a block confirmation. The network then releases more Bitcoin (BTC).Finding the target hash can take miners a long time. The amount of time varies based on many factors, such as the Bitcoin network’s current mining difficulty. A difficulty adjustment occurs every 2,016 blocks and raises or lowers based on the number of miners contributing. More miners means a higher difficulty, while fewer miners means a lower difficulty. Mining rigs abide by Bitcoin’s mining algorithm, SHA-256. SHA-256 is a cryptographic hash function used in password hashing and digital signature verification, among other applications. In the case of Bitcoin, it is used for hashing.A new block is mined every 10 minutes, and the network releases a fixed amount of Bitcoin and distributes it to miners. This release of Bitcoin is called a block reward. Before the Bitcoin halving in April 2024, the block reward was 6.25 per block. The Bitcoin halving event reduced this reward to 3.125 Bitcoin, with halvings occurring roughly every four years. This halving process was programmed by Bitcoin’s creator and is designed to create digital scarcity and maintain the value of Bitcoin, which also dramatically affects mining profitability.Bitcoin’s creator programmed the network to halve every 210,000 blocks (around every four years) to create digital scarcity. At this rate, Bitcoin won’t hit its 21 million cap until 2140.At that point, miners will still earn rewards through transaction fees but will no longer release new Bitcoin into the network.                                                                    What’s the average time needed to mine a single Bitcoin?                                        The length of time it takes to mine 1 Bitcoin can vary.Each committed Bitcoin block releases 3.125 Bitcoin. To answer the central question in mind, it takes an average of 10 minutes to mine not just 1 Bitcoin but 3 — and that rate will fluctuate over time. But, due to the massive amount of computing power it takes to mine a single block (otherwise known as block time), it’s almost impossible for one miner to receive all 3.125 of the reward.How long does it take for one person to mine 1 Bitcoin? This number will range significantly due to the miner’s hardware. For example, some miners have dozens, if not hundreds, of pieces of mining hardware in an attempt to increase their hash rate. In that case, they will likely earn more Bitcoin per block than other miners with a lower hash rate. Many miners join a mining pool to contribute to Bitcoin mining in a meaningful way.A mining pool is a group of miners all contributing their hash rate as one entity in hopes of finding a target hash. In doing so, miners earn rewards based on their hash rate contribution.Rewards are distributed by a mining pool operator, who often charges a mining pool fee. However, miners can contribute to different types of mining pools.ProportionalA proportional mining pool distributes rewards based on a miner’s hash rate contribution. They can also earn additional rewards through transaction fees.Pay per last N groupsPay per last N groups mining pools distribute miners into shifts and pay them out based on their time on “shift.” A shift is a set period in which the miner contributes to the mining pool.Pay-per-sharePay-per-share pools provide miners with a fixed income, expecting them to contribute a certain amount of their hash rate daily. While this is a stable way to mine Bitcoin, it removes a miner’s ability to earn transaction fees.                                                                    How hard is it to solo mine Bitcoin?                                        Solo mining Bitcoin involves one miner competing with every other miner globally. Bitcoin’s proof-of-work (PoW) consensus protocol makes mining a natural competition. The chances of a solo miner beating the rest of the world to a block’s target hash are nearly zero — no matter their mining rigs’ power.In Bitcoin’s early days, mining difficulty was relatively low due to the lack of miners. Block rewards were also much higher, with miners earning dozens of Bitcoin per block. However, Bitcoin was worth less than $1 back then, so the reward was a bit more fitting.Presently, solo miners join cryptocurrency mining pools to have any chance of earning rewards from Bitcoin mining. Potential miners without a powerful mining rig can also join a cloud mining service to save on the initial investment cost. Cloud mining services consist of miners leasing out their hashing power via the cloud and asking users to pay for a share of it. As a result, the miners offload some energy consumption costs to paying users. In return, paying users earn block rewards based on their share of hashing power.                                                                    How to earn 1 Bitcoin per day without investment?                                        It takes money to make money. Earning Bitcoin without investment is nearly impossible, but there are inexpensive ways to get involved.It is nearly impossible to earn 1 Bitcoin per day without investment. Bitcoin mining requires energy consumption, which miners pay through their electricity bills. Moreover, Bitcoin mining is intended to get harder and harder over time. It requires a lot of electricity and specialized, pricey hardware. It is almost hard for an individual to mine 1 Bitcoin per day, even with substantial expenditure. Anyone wishing to mine Bitcoin would have to compete with powerful mining operations, with their economies of scale giving them a significant competitive edge over individual miners.As of May 6, 2024, 1 Bitcoin is worth $64,116. Earning this much daily without investment would heavily destabilize the cryptocurrency market. Therefore, beware of websites or programs claiming to help you earn 1 Bitcoin daily for free. These are often scams designed to exploit people looking for quick returns.Those looking to invest in crypto mining should first learn about crypto trading, blockchain technology and cryptocurrency markets. Over time, they might be able to turn minor investments into larger sums of money with the right information and approaches.

Kronos Research hacker shifts funds to Tornado Cash

The exploiter behind the $25 million exploit of quantitative trading firm  Kronos Research in mid-November last year has started to move funds nearly six months after the exploit.The hacker wallet address first transferred 1,314 Ether (ETH) worth $4 million to a new address, starting with 0x8F5e4 and later transferred all the ETH to another address starting with  0x164A24b. Source: PeckShieldThe hacker made 10 transactions of 100 ETH from the final wallet and transferred it to Tornado Cash, a crypto-mixing tool. Source: EtherscanTornado Cash is an open-source cryptocurrency tumbler that operates on networks compatible with the Ethereum Virtual Machine. The mixing services obscure the path of the crypto transactions and make it extremely difficult to trace the original source of the funds.Although created as a privacy tool, hackers often use these mixing services to launder stolen funds via decentralized exchange platforms. The significant usage of Tornado Cash for transferring illicit funds prompted the United States government to impose sanctions on its use in August 2022. Subsequently, its founders were charged with money laundering and sanctions violations a year later.Related: Five US enforcement agencies form new digital currency anti-crime task forceWhile opinions within the crypto community vary regarding the adoption of privacy tools, there is a consensus against governmental persecution of developers and creators solely for creating an application.The crypto analytics firm PeckShield raised an alert regarding the transfer of funds on X and cautioned that the transfer to Tornado Cash suggests that the hacker is attempting to launder the stolen funds.Over the years, exploiters have chosen crypto-mixing services over centralized exchanges as once they are identified, addresses are blocked by exchanges.Kronos Capital was exploited in November 2023 after the exploiters managed to gain access to the firm’s API keys. The firm first denied any loss of funds during its early announcement. Later, on-chain investigator ZachXBT revealed that roughly 12,800 ETH worth $25 million was stolen and transferred into six unique crypto wallet addresses. Kronos Capital halted its trading services to investigate the loss.Magazine: Breaking into Liberland: Dodging guards with inner-tubes, decoys and diplomats

The crypto wallet MetaMask has announced the update for Ethereum

MetaMask, one of the most popular crypto wallets, has announced a major update called ‘Intelligent Transactions’, aimed at combating the widespread issue of front-running on the Ethereum network. 
This move is part of a broader initiative to improve the functionality and security of transactions for its large user base.

The update of the crypto wallet Metamask for the Ethereum network
Front-running is a common issue in decentralized finance (DeFi) where traders or bots anticipate other transactions in the mempool (a sort of waiting room for transactions before they are confirmed on the blockchain) and place their own transaction first by paying higher gas fees. 
This unethical practice can lead to market manipulations and unfair advantages, negatively influencing users’ trust and the overall efficiency of the market.
The new ‘Smart Transaction‘ feature of MetaMask aims to reduce these risks by introducing several advanced mechanisms.
The key component of this update is the implementation of private transaction channels that keep transaction details hidden from the public mempool until they are ready to be processed. This approach reduces the visibility of transactions to potential front-runners.
Furthermore, ‘Intelligent Transactions’ employ sophisticated routing algorithms that analyze the network in real time to determine the optimal path for transaction execution, minimizing delays and potential exposure to front-running. 
MetaMask also promises improved encryption methods to further protect transaction data, ensuring that only intended parties can access and process it.
The importance of this new feature
The launch of ‘Intelligent Transactions’ is a fundamental step in MetaMask’s ambitious program to revise its core systems. 
Traditionally, Ethereum wallets like MetaMask have functioned more as gateways to interact with the blockchain, heavily relying on Ethereum network’s standard protocols and exposed transaction processes.
However, with the increasing complexity and scalability issues of the Ethereum network, MetaMask is taking proactive measures to optimize user experience and security.
This initiative also includes plans to improve the design of user interfaces, making them more intuitive and easy to use, especially for those who are new to using cryptocurrencies.
Furthermore, the integration of more robust security features such as multifactor authentication and biometric verification is set to enhance the overall security of digital asset management within the portfolio.
The transition of MetaMask to a more secure and efficient framework comes at a crucial moment. 
The Ethereum network has been under significant pressure due to its growing popularity and the resulting increase in fees and transaction times. 
Innovative solutions like ‘Intelligent Transactions’ are essential to maintain Ethereum’s position as a leading platform for DeFi activities.
The cryptocurrency community has reacted positively to the announcement of MetaMask. Many see this move as progressive not only because it addresses immediate issues like front-running, but also because it sets a precedent for other wallet providers and blockchain projects to improve their operational frameworks. 
Facing security concerns head-on, MetaMask is likely to strengthen its reputation and user trust, which are crucial in the competitive market of crypto wallets.
Conclusions
MetaMask with the launch of ‘Intelligent Transactions’ marks a significant milestone in its development. This feature not only represents a tool to combat front-running, but is part of a broader strategy to redefine the operation of the most widely used Ethereum wallet. 
As MetaMask continues to innovate and improve its service offerings, it remains at the forefront of developing technologies that could shape the future of cryptocurrency transactions on the Ethereum network. 
This proactive approach in combating front-running and strengthening transaction security could set new standards of security and efficiency in the DeFi space, benefiting the entire cryptocurrency ecosystem. 
MetaMask’s commitment to adapting and evolving alongside blockchain technology demonstrates a strong dedication to security, efficiency, and ease of use for cryptocurrency users worldwide.

                        Polygon, a prominent Ethereum layer-2 developer, has introduced the alpha version testnet of its latest zero-knowledge (ZK)-rollup solution named Miden.In a post on May 6, Polygon announced that the Polygon Miden Alpha Testnet zero-knowledge is now live, enabling developers to initiate testing. Miden is a ZK-rollup specifically designed to enhance the capabilities of the Ethereum blockchain.Miden Incorporates Client-Side Proving
Similar to other ZK-rollups, Polygon’s latest solution utilizes a cryptographic technique that allows data to be verified or “proved” without disclosing its contents to the rest of the network. Miden also incorporates client-side proving, which enables users to generate proofs for their own state transitions locally, without the need to reveal the state to the network. This approach aims to reduce the network load, enhance privacy, and improve scalability.Additionally, Miden introduces new functionalities, including private accounts that support private tokens and transactions, where only the hash of the account is stored on the blockchain. The solution also leverages parallel transaction execution, allowing concurrent processing of transactions, resulting in significantly higher throughput compared to the Ethereum mainnet and reduced blockchain node state bloat.The roadmap for Miden indicates that a builders testnet is scheduled for September, although no specific timeframe has been mentioned for the mainnet launch.Miden enters the market in direct competition with StarkWare’s layer-2 scaling network and rollup technology stack, known as StarkNet, as well as other alternatives like Matter Labs’ zkSync Era. Polygon also offers zkEVM, a scaling solution equivalent to the Ethereum Virtual Machine, which enables seamless compatibility with existing smart contracts, tools, and wallets.Despite the launch of the Miden testnet, the native token of the Polygon blockchain, also named Polygon, did not experience a significant reaction in the market. At the time of writing, Polygon’s token had fallen by 5% to trade at $0.704.Polygon Labs CEO Condemns Ethereum Layer 3 Networks
Last month, Polygon Labs CEO Marc Boiron lashed out at Layer 3 (L3) networks on the Ethereum blockchain, claiming they are unnecessary for scaling the network and only serve to drain value from the mainnet.At the time, Boiron expressed his skepticism about L3 networks, stating that Polygon Labs, a prominent Layer 2 (L2) scaling network for Ethereum, does not work on L3s because they are not essential for scaling existing networks. “L3s exist only to take value away from Ethereum and onto the L2s on which the L3s are built,” he argued.The L3 ecosystem includes various solutions from L2 networks such as Orbs, Xai, zkSync Hyperchains, and the recently launched Degen Chain on Arbitrum Orbit. Meanwhile, the Polygon Proof-of-Stake (PoS) sidechain has successfully executed the Napoli hard fork, adding support for Dencun features and making it the first network to support RIP-7212. EIP-1153 aims to enhance the efficiency of block space utilization, optimizing the overall performance of the network.

News from the crypto Atom, Shiba Inu, and Cardano

Despite the fact that at the moment the crypto markets are dominated by Bitcoin price movements, there are some cryptocurrencies that follow their own trend: let’s examine ATOM (Cosmos), SHIB (Shiba Inu) and ADA (Cardano). 

Analysis of the cryptocurrencies Cosmos (ATOM), Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Cardano (ADA)
ATOM is the native cryptocurrency of the Cosmos ecosystem.
In theory Cosmos is an independent ecosystem, which should not be influenced by Bitcoin or Ethereum.
Actually, the price trend of ATOM is heavily influenced by that of BTC, and to a lesser extent by that of ETH, although with some movements of its own. 
 In particular, in the last seven days the market value of ATOM has increased by 12%, compared to -3% for ETH and +0.1% for BTC. 
This positive difference for ATOM, however, is followed by a sharp drop in the last thirty days, during which it has lost 18%. 
In other words, just before mid-April, during the pre-halving retracement, the price of the Cosmos cryptocurrency experienced a sharp drop, much greater than that of Bitcoin or Ethereum.
Since then it has simply been bouncing back, going from $7.7 to $9.1.
What is surprising, however, is that its current price is actually lower than the $10.6 at the beginning of the year, even though in mid-March it managed to rise above $14. 
In short, 2024 is not proving to be a great year for ATOM so far, as its price is still down by a staggering -79% from the highs of 2021.
Just suffice to say that the current price is even lower than that of May last year, and this is because not even 2023 was a great year for the Cosmos cryptocurrency.
An even uglier fact is that the current price is not much higher than that of August 2020, before the start of the last major bull run, and that in October of last year it had also dropped heavily below that threshold. 
It almost seems that since the implosion of Earth/Moon in 2022, ATOM has lost all the gains from the last big bull run in 2021 and has never been able to recover them. 
The trend of SHIB (Shiba Inu)
Shiba Inu is one of the most important memecoins existing today. 
Although it is a token, and not a native cryptocurrency, the project has its own blockchain which is only a layer-2 of Ethereum. 
Even for SHIB, the last few months are not proving to be particularly happy so far. 
In the last seven days it has lost 1.5%, and in the last thirty days it is losing 16%.
It should be noted, however, that the current price of 23 cents is significantly higher than the 10 cents at the beginning of the year. 
So despite a -16% in the last thirty days, it still maintains a +120% since the beginning of the year. 
However, it must be said that 2023 has not been a particularly good year for the price of Shiba Inu, as it has only managed to go from 8 to 10 thousandths of a dollar even in the face of the beginning of the bull run in October. 
Currently, it is still down by -73% from the highs of 2021, and since the implosion of Terra/Luna two years ago, it has only made one significant upward movement this year, at the beginning of March, when in just a few days it went from just under 10 millionths of a dollar to almost 36 millionths, with a +260% in a week. 
Being a memecoin, its price trend moves in jumps, with real pumps often followed by dumps. 
Furthermore, it should not be forgotten that recently other memecoins have landed on the crypto markets that are performing better than SHIB in terms of price. 
ADA (Cardano) performance
ADA is the native cryptocurrency of the Cardano blockchain. 
Despite still being among the top 10 cryptocurrencies by market capitalization, its price performance is definitely disappointing. 
In the last seven days it is losing 1.5%, while in the last thirty days it is at -24%. However, what strikes the most is the -24% since the beginning of the year, which makes it the cryptocurrency with the highest loss in 2024 so far among the top 15. 
However at least until April 12th it had not performed badly in this 2024, going from $0.6 to $0.77, but only to drop in the last few weeks even below $0.45. 
In other words, the good results of the first two and a half months of the year have turned out to be just a flash in the pan. 
However, the picture improves slightly if the analysis is extended to 2023. 
Indeed, last year it started at $0.24, then rose to $0.6 thanks to the end-of-year bull run. 
So for Cardano, 2023 has been a clearly positive year, while instead 2024 is currently proving to be disappointing. 
The fact is that, despite the ongoing bull run, it has never managed to rise above the $0.9 it had before the Terra/Luna implosion, so much so that the current price is still -85% compared to the all-time highs of 2021. 
Even the fact that the bottom of the bear market of 2022 was reached at the end of 2023 does not shed a good light on the medium-long term trend of this cryptocurrency.

Revolut debuts dedicated crypto exchange for UK users

The fintech company and global neobank Revolut made a notable move into the cryptocurrency sphere by quietly introducing a specialized crypto trading platform for retail customers in the United Kingdom.Revolut unveiled Revolut X on May 7, targeting a specific set of customers. The platform is designed to rival major cryptocurrency exchanges by offering easy access for users and charging minimal fees, according to a press release shared with Cointelegraph. The platform features easy "on-ramping" and "off-ramping," allowing users to seamlessly convert fiat currencies like GBP to crypto and vice versa. Notably, Revolut X offers fixed fees of 0% for makers and 0.09% for takers, regardless of trading volume, potentially undercutting competitors.Leonid Bashlykov, the Revolut head of crypto exchange product, said that the company is “excited” to introduce a new crypto product that will “change the game for experienced crypto traders.”“We understand that competitive fees as well as easy on and off ramping are at the heart of what experienced traders want from a crypto platform.”Initially, the platform will offer trading for over 100 cryptocurrencies, including popular choices like Bitcoin (BTC), Ether (ETH), and XRP (XRP). However, it says it plans to expand this selection in the coming months. It added that while the platform was designed with seasoned crypto traders in mind, any U.K. users with a retail account will have access to Revolut X desktop with their existing credentials and can trade directly between the platform and their Revolut accounts without any additional fees or limitations.Cointelegraph reached out to Revolut for further information on the development. Related: Crypto exchanges to meet Nigerian SEC chief for regulatory talksThis move comes after the company scaled back its crypto offerings in both the U.K. and the U.S. due to regulatory hurdles.Revolut — which started in the U.K. offering money transfers in 2015 — has grown to become one of the country’s largest fintech companies, with over 40 million users worldwide. It began allowing users to buy, hold, and trade cryptocurrencies in 2017.However, in December 2023, the company planned to halt crypto services in the U.K. ahead of new regulations from the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA). The FCA's rules, which aim to increase transparency and protect investors, have presented challenges for several crypto firms. Prior to that, in August 2023, the company suspended its crypto-related services in the U.S., though it only affected around 1% of its user base. The launch of Revolut X signifies a renewed focus on crypto for Revolut. It follows the March 2024 introduction of Revolut Ramp, a service that allows users to purchase crypto directly within their Web3 wallets through a partnership with Consensys, the developer of MetaMask.Magazine: CZ gets jail sentence, Gensler viewed Ether as security, and FBI targets mixers: Hodler’s Digest, April 28 – May 4

Grayscale's Bitcoin ETF Breakout Series Ends! Successive Entries Started to Appear! - Bitcoin Sistemi

Grayscale's GBTC spot Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) recorded net inflows for the second day in a row, according to SosoValue data.
Grayscale's Bitcoin ETF Sees Second Day of Net Inflows
The fund withdrew $4 million on Monday, marking a positive shift after a 78-day streak of net outflows that ended last Friday with an addition of $63 million.


Since converting to a spot Bitcoin fund in January, GBTC has experienced cumulative net outflows of $17 billion.
Despite this, it currently manages approximately 292,217 BTC ($18.4 billion) in assets, a decrease from 619,220 BTC on January 11, as reported on its website.





On the other hand, 11 US-based spot Bitcoin ETFs added funds worth a total of $217.06 million on Monday. Fidelity's FBTC led net inflows with $99 million, while Ark Invest's Bitcoin fund attracted $76 million.
BlackRock's IBIT fund, which recorded zero to negative flows last week, recorded an inflow of $22 million on Monday.



Invesco and Galaxy Digital's BTCO also reported daily net inflows of $11 million, and Bitwise, VanEck and Franklin Templeton funds had net inflows of around $2 million each.
These funds maintained the positive flow they regained last Friday, the first total net inflow since April 23. Last month, the first net monthly outflow was recorded for US spot Bitcoin ETFs, with approximately $343.5 million removed from the funds.





However, daily trading volume for these funds has decreased compared to their peaks in March. While the total transaction volume last week was approximately 11 billion dollars, a transaction volume of over 32 billion dollars was recorded in the first week of March.

Whispers In The Deep: Why Are Ethereum Whales Disappearing?


                            Ethereum (ETH), the world’s second-largest cryptocurrency, continues to grapple with uncertainty after a steep price decline. Investors are on tenterhooks, with whales exiting their positions and the market sentiment teetering between fear and a glimmer of hope.

Ethereum Price Struggles To Regain Footing
Ethereum’s price has been on a rollercoaster ride in recent months. After reaching new highs in late 2021, the cryptocurrency plunged dramatically, leaving investors reeling. The recovery has been slow, with Ethereum currently hovering around $3,077 – a far cry from its peak.
Source: Coingecko
This lackluster performance is causing anxiety among investors, particularly large holders known as whales. Recent data from Lookonchain paints a concerning picture: a whale who bought ETH a year ago is cashing out, pocketing a cool $16 million in profit. This whale’s actions highlight a potential exodus of major investors, which could further depress the price.
Fear Grips Ethereum Whales
WhaleStats, a platform that tracks large cryptocurrency holders, reveals that Ethereum whales are experiencing extreme fear. The BSC Chain Ethereum Whales’ Fear and Greed Index, a measure of investor sentiment, is currently in the “extreme fear” zone. This suggests that whales are hesitant to make any significant moves, waiting for the market to stabilize before deploying their capital.
Source: WhaleStats
While Ethereum remains the most popular token among whales, their apprehension is palpable. They are closely monitoring market movements, waiting for a clear signal before taking the plunge.
Divided Opinions On Ether’s Future
The future of Ethereum remains a subject of debate among crypto analysts. Ashcrypto, a prominent analyst, believes in a potential rebound in the third quarter of this year. Based on historical patterns from 2020 and 2021, Ashcrypto predicts a price surge towards $4,000.

Data from IntoTheBlock reveals a strong correlation between Ethereum’s price and large transaction volume. The recent drop in large transactions coincides with the price decline, suggesting that whales play a critical role in influencing Ethereum’s trajectory.

ETH Price Action At A Glance
Meanwhile, with its next target of $3,090, Ether is expected to continue its correcting bearish trend, demonstrating further bearish bias when it settles below $3,120 once more.
If the price breaks $3,100, it will halt the projected slide and try to reclaim the main positive trend. A move below the EMA50 would support the continuation of the recommended negative wave.

Is Ethereum Headed For A Revival?
The answer remains unclear. While some analysts predict a resurgence, the ongoing whale selling and fearful market sentiment pose significant challenges. The coming months will be crucial for Ethereum, as it navigates a volatile market and attempts to regain investor confidence.

'Dogecoin Killer' Shiba Inu's Burn Rate Dips 84% Amid Sluggish Shibarium Transactions - Benzinga

Shiba Inu SHIB/USD, the meme cryptocurrency proclaimed as the ‘Dogecoin DOGE/USD Killer,' saw a drastic decline in its burn rate in the last 24 hours, slowing down the rate at which tokens are pushed out of circulation.What happened: In an X post on Tuesday, Shiba Inu's official burn tracker, Shibburn reported the burning of 12.47 million coins in the 24-hour timeframe, marking a drastic 84% drop.  The decline reversed the upward trend of the previous seven days when more than 132 million tokens were burned at an impressive weekly growth rate of 28.27%.A big factor behind the burn rate dip was low activity on the project's layer-2 blockchain, Shibarium. The number of transactions on the network plunged following an exponential increase in mid-April, according to Shibarium Explorer. Even the much-publicized hard fork failed to jack up transaction numbers. Why it matters: Coin burning has become one of the most keenly-watched events in the cryptocurrency space. Most projects look for ways to remove tokens from circulation to apply deflationary pressure to the asset. As far as SHIB is concerned, a small portion of the fees is burned every time a transaction is made on the network. Shibarium, with its growing popularity and utility, is a vital cog in SHIB's deflationary ambitions. Price action: SHIB was trading at $0.00002381 at the time of publication, falling nearly 5% in the last 24 hours, according to data from Benzinga Pro. Trading volume jumped 70% to $602 million.Read Next: Bitcoin, Ethereum, Dogecoin Dip After Robinhood Gets Wells Notice From SEC — Analyst Says ETHs Weak Fundamentals A ‘Roadblock’ For King CryptoPhoto by Dennis Diatel on Shutterstock

Bitcoin Price Prediction: Hits $64,000 on U.S. Economic Slowdown, Rate Cut Hopes

                        Bitcoin Price PredictionBitcoin failed to continue its upward trend despite multiple supporting factors such as a bearish US dollar and a dovish stance from the Federal Reserve. It lost some of its gains, dropping to around 63,400 and hitting an intraday low of 62,961.Although Bitcoin began the week on a bullish note after dipping to a low of $56,000 last week, it surged to $64,000 on Monday, spurred by a cooler-than-expected US April jobs report. The report suggested a slowing economy, which could lead to reduced inflation and lower interest rates.However, the increase in price was short-lived as BTC edged lower on Tuesday, possibly due to cautious sentiment ahead of a speech by Neel Kashkari, the President of the Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis. If his comments take a hawkish tone, signaling a stricter approach to interest rates, it could strengthen the US dollar and negatively impact BTC.Marathon Digital Soars 18%: A Beacon in Bitcoin Mining Amid Market Uncertainty
Marathon Digital Holdings, a prominent player in the Bitcoin mining sector, recently witnessed an 18% surge in its stock price to $20.67, elevating its market capitalization to nearly $800 million. This significant increase followed the announcement that Marathon would be included in the S&P SmallCap 600 Index, underscoring its rising prominence within the cryptocurrency mining industry.Marathon Digital Holdings Inc (MARA)Key Points:
Marathon Digital’s stock jumps 18%, market cap approaches $800 million.
Inclusion in S&P SmallCap 600 highlights its growing industry importance.
The company introduces an executive bonus plan to tie leadership gains to shareholder interests.
Despite Marathon’s stock success, Bitcoin itself has shown bearish trends, trading around $63,200, which reflects a complex sentiment in the broader market. This contrast suggests that while individual companies may thrive, the overall cryptocurrency market remains cautiously optimistic or mixed.SEC Stalls on Ethereum ETFs While Investment Soars in Bitcoin Options
The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has postponed its decision on approving Ethereum exchange-traded funds (ETFs) once again, extending the review period for Galaxy Invesco’s application by an additional 60 days to July 5. This delay continues a trend seen in earlier postponements affecting major financial players such as BlackRock and Fidelity, casting doubts on a near-term approval due to ongoing regulatory uncertainties. Analysts are increasingly sceptical about the likelihood of Ethereum ETF approval in the current climate.
Key Points:

SEC defers Ethereum ETF decision, extending Galaxy Invesco’s review to July.
Historical delays for major applicants like BlackRock and Fidelity enhance regulatory unpredictability.
In contrast, significant investments in Bitcoin ETFs, such as Hightower’s $68.35 million, highlight a diverging confidence level between Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs.


While Ethereum faces regulatory hurdles, investment in Bitcoin ETFs is on the rise, with firms like Hightower directing substantial capital towards them, underscoring a stronger market confidence in Bitcoin. This trend suggests that the market may be favouring Bitcoin over Ethereum amid these regulatory uncertainties, potentially influencing Bitcoin’s price positively in the near term.Anticipated Fed Rate Cuts Propel Bitcoin Demand Amid Weakening Dollar
The recent U.S. job market report has heightened expectations that the Federal Reserve may cut interest rates later this year, leading to a softer U.S. dollar and increased attractiveness of Bitcoin. Richmond Fed President Thomas Barkin supports maintaining current rates to manage inflation, while New York Fed President John Williams suggests potential rate reductions as early as September or November.Markets now forecast a total reduction of 46 basis points by 2024, signalling a shift towards a more accommodative monetary policy. This anticipated easing has consequently bolstered Bitcoin’s appeal as a hedge against currency devaluation, driving up demand and potentially its price.
Key Points:

Anticipation of Fed rate cuts weakens the dollar, enhancing Bitcoin’s appeal.
Potential rate cuts could total 46 basis points by 2024.
Increased Bitcoin demand may lead to higher prices.


This growing interest in Bitcoin, spurred by the prospect of lower interest rates, underscores its role as an alternative investment during times of monetary easing, possibly leading to a sustained increase in Bitcoin’s market value.


On Tuesday, bitcoin price prediction seems bullish. The cryptocurrency is currently trading at $63,535, marking a 0.59% increase. The asset now hovers above its pivot point at $63,002, suggesting a potential bullish trajectory. Immediate resistance levels are identified at $65,512, followed by $67,331 and $69,441, which BTC needs to breach to sustain upward momentum.
Conversely, Bitcoin finds immediate support at $60,928, with further support levels at $58,927 and $56,625 that could provide stabilization in case of a decline. The 50-Day Exponential Moving Average, positioned at $62,631, aligns closely with the pivot point, reinforcing support for potential upward movement.


Bitcoin Price Prediction – Source: Tradingview
Key Points:

Bitcoin’s immediate resistance at $65,512; breaking this could confirm continued gains.
Support established around $60,928, crucial for short-term stability.
Bullish trend likely if BTC maintains above $63,000; risks of sharp sell-offs if it falls below.

In conclusion, Bitcoin shows signs of a positive trend as long as it remains above $63,000. However, a drop below this critical level could trigger significant selling pressure.

This is what an RFK Jr. capital gains tax could look like


President Joe Biden recently brought taxes – capital gains taxes – into the forefront of the discussion with a budget plan that immediately proved a hot topic of discussion.
The plan would entail raising the maximum capital gains tax rate to an unprecedented 44.6%. For comparison, the rate started off at 7%, rose to 12.5% with the introduction of the Revenue Act in 1921, and only briefly stood at the previous record of 40% under President Carter.
Biden’s proposal also made a stir as it included another unprecedented element: an unrealized gains tax that would affect investors worth more than $100 million.


Having analyzed in response what a Trump tax rate might look like and the issues its implementation might face, Finbold decided to turn toward the independent Dalcassian candidate, Robert F. Kennedy Junior, the third most likely man to become president and see what his plan might look like.
The RFK capital gains tax
Given that he was one of the first to mention tax policy during the campaign, RFK Jr. has been surprisingly tight-lipped about hypothetical and desired changes to capital gains tax rates.
Some likely policy decisions can, however, be inferred from his other promises, best exemplified by one of the campaign slogans: It’s “We The People,” Not “We The Corporations.”
This, paired with the promise to close the Washington revolving door of politicians and bureaucrats swiftly moving to executive and lobbyist jobs and vice versa, might indicate that changing tax rates might be less of a priority than closing the numerous loopholes.
In a tax sense, these loopholes helped lead to a situation in which the IRS head recently claimed the richest Americans managed to evade paying about $150 billion each year.
Such a conclusion is further bolstered by the preferences of RFK Jr. voters, as compiled by the platform iSideWith, which indicates closing loopholes, levying more taxes on the richest, and keeping the capital gains rate unchanged not to disincentivize investing are high priorities.
RFK’s Bitcoin centerpiece
One area Kennedy has not been vague in is taxing Bitcoin (BTC). Already in the summer of 2023, RFK Jr. explained he believed that BTC should be exempted from capital gains taxes, particularly when being converted into dollars or another fiat currency.
While the approach is very enticing to any crypto trader, something can be said about the conclusion reached by Joseph Thorndike and Robert Goulder: it carries a paradox in its heart. 
Indeed, exempting Bitcoin from capital gains taxes would, in all likelihood, contradict Kennedy’s hypothetical anti-corruption drive as it would open new loopholes to replace the ones he would have presumably closed.

US Government Now Holds $13.82B Worth of Bitcoin | Coinspeaker



Although the US government holds a significant amount of Bitcoin, it has periodically sold portions of its crypto holdings.

According to data from the blockchain intelligence firm Arkham, the US government’s Bitcoin (BTC) holdings have reached a total of 216.788, worth approximately $13.83 billion. The company, focused on deanonymizing entities within the crypto space, said the increase stems from recent developments, particularly the seizure of assets from Banmeet Singh, an Indian national involved in illegal activities on the dark web.
Singh, who pleaded guilty to drug distribution charges in January this year, forfeited approximately $150 million in proceeds from his illicit operations. Additionally, authorities confiscated 3940 BTC belonging to the offender. The assets are currently valued at around  $250 million.




US Bitcoin Seizures
The recent seizure significantly contributed to the government’s Bitcoin reserves, which now total $13.8 billion. Arkham said a substantial portion of these assets may have been acquired through criminal seizures.
Before the recent addition, the US government’s Bitcoin holdings stood at approximately $8 billion. As of October 2023, the country held around $5.3 billion worth of Bitcoin.
According to separate data from blockchain analytics firm Dune, the government has confiscated around 200,000 tokens from cybercriminals since 2020.
The country’s top three Bitcoin seizures from November 2020 until now include the infamous Silk Road seizures totaling 69,369 BTC, the January 2022 Bitfinex Hack Seizure of 94,643 BTC, and the March 2022 James Zhong Seizure of 51,326 BTC.
US Leads in Largest Bitcoin Holdings
Due to its extensive Bitcoin portfolio, the United States recently emerged as one of the largest crypto holders on a regional scale. Arkham data showed that the US held around 212,847 Bitcoins as of April 2024, topping countries like the UK and Germany.


In addition to Bitcoin, the authorities also owned a significant portion of Ethereum (ETH) and other cryptocurrencies, such as USDT and USDC, with a total valuation of $200 million.
The UK and Germany took second and third place, respectively. Arkham said the British government held around  61,245 BTC, while the German government owned 49,858 BTC.
US Government Sells Bitcoin Holdings
Although the US government holds a significant amount of Bitcoin, it has periodically sold portions of its crypto holdings, especially BTC.
For instance, in March 2023, the US sold approximately 10,000 Bitcoins linked to the Silk Road case. In January this year, the government disclosed its intent to sell another portion of Bitcoin worth around $130 million.
Additionally, data from researcher Jameson Lopp revealed that the US Marshals had facilitated the sale of 195,000 BTC on behalf of the government. The total BTC seized and sold amounts to 195,091.75, yielding a total sales gain of $366 million.
Last month, the US government transferred another portion of the Silk Road seizure, valued at approximately $200 million at the time, to Coinbase. The exchange received around 30,175 Bitcoins from a wallet associated with the US government.

Flying Pepe (FLYPEPE) to Skyrocket 7,000% Ahead of MEXC Listing, as Bonk and Dogecoin Lag



                    

Flying Pepe (FLYPEPE) could turn early investors into multi-millionaires if it becomes a mainstream coin, like Bonk (BONK) and Dogecoin (DOGE).



Flying Pepe (FLYPEPE), a new Solana memecoin that was launched this week, is poised to explode over 7,000% in price in the coming days.




This is because FLYPEPE has announced its first centralized exchange listing, which will be on MEXC.



This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up.



Currently, Flying Pepe can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jupiter and Raydium, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days.




Early investors in BONK and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Flying Pepe could become the next viral memecoin.



To buy Flying Pepe on Raydium or Jupiter ahead of the MEXC listing, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Flying Pepe by entering its contract address – 65orYrJbQxa5BZUWyeCsDtJC7JZg8zQYcvRZpvnnd5eq – in the receiving field.



In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Bonk (BONK) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price.



If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner.




The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Bonk (BONK), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum.



This is why many BONK, DOGE, and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like FLYPEPE.

Blockchain analysis indicates that the hackers behind the November theft from Poloniex, involving $117 million, have transferred funds to Tornado Cash in 100 Ethereum (ETH) batches. Notably, these funds, worth about $3.3 million, were inactive for nearly six months before Tuesday’s transaction.
Concurrently, the hackers involved in a separate incident at Kronos Research transferred 200 ETH directly to Tornado Cash and about 1,314 ETH (valued at around $4 million) to a new crypto wallet – 0x164. From here, the funds have started moving to Tornado Cash, with the current balance at 314 ETH, approximately $962,000.

This saga commenced with a significant security breach at Taipei-based Kronos Research in November 2023. The incident resulted in a loss of $26 million due to unauthorized access to the firm’s API keys.

Tornado Cash, the platform utilized by these hackers, was designed to obscure the origins of crypto assets by blending them across various wallets over time. However, the US Treasury sanctioned the platform in 2022 following its association with Lazarus, a North Korean hacking group. Lazarus used Tornado Cash to launder money from the $615 million Ronin bridge exploit.
The repercussions of using Tornado Cash have been significant. The US Department of Justice (DOJ) has levied several charges against its developers, Roman Storm and Roman Semenov. These include conspiracy to commit money laundering and operating an unlicensed money transmitter. 
The DOJ’s recent filings argue against dismissing the charges against Storm, emphasizing that a jury should determine the nature of Tornado Cash’s services. Furthermore, the DOJ challenges the claim that Tornado Cash was not a money-transmitting business due to a lack of fund control.

“The definition of ‘money transmitting’ in Section 1960 does not require the money transmitter to have ‘control’ of the funds being transferred. The definition exends to ‘transferring funds on behalf of the public by any and all means,” the DOJ legal team argued.

New Solana Mememcoin Oil King Coin Will Explode 8,300%, Looks to Challenge Shiba Inu and Dogecoin



                    

Oil King (OILKING) could become a viral memecoin, like Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE).



Oil King (OILKING), a Solana memecoin that was launched this week, is aiming to challenge other memecoin giants, such as Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE).




Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Oil King presents a similar opportunity.



Oil King has market cap below $25,000 at the moment, meaning that when it just reaches a modest market cap of $200,000-$500,000, early investors would generate massive returns in a matter of days or hours.



The exciting memecoin is poised to rally 8,300% in the coming two days, and Oil King could potentially reach a multi-million dollar market cap within a few weeks.




Currently, Oil King can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jupiter and Raydium, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days.



To buy Oil King on these platforms, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Oil King by entering its contract address – H5LmDBec75DmGLwtALURVAtLuVDUX1GMh5CGQ8r5h5rU – in the receiving field.



In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price.



If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner.




The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum.



This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like OILKING.

Revolut Launches Crypto Exchange for Professional Traders Dubbed Revolut X | Coinspeaker



This newly developed exchange will allow customers to trade directly from it rather than using the Revolut app, thereby enjoying lower fees.

Revolut, a digital banking firm based in London, has launched Revolut X, a cryptocurrency exchange aimed at providing a suitable trading platform for professional traders. This move makes them the first bank to develop a separate platform for cryptocurrency traders.
Unveiling Revolut X: A Dedicated Platform for Crypto Enthusiasts
The digital bank, which boasts 40 million users across the globe, has been permitting its customers to buy and sell crypto on its Revolut App before announcing in February that it will be developing a separate crypto exchange.




This newly developed exchange will allow customers to trade directly from it rather than using the Revolut app, thereby enjoying lower fees. The structure of the fees has been set: the maker of the trade will be charged zero fees, while the taker of the trade will be charged 0.09%.
According to Revolut, the new development aims to compete with established and leading crypto exchanges. Starting today, the platform designed for professional traders is now available on desktops for all UK customers with a Revolut retail account. Digital assets like those already on the Revolut retail app will first be available on the new exchange platform. These include Bitcoin, Ethereum, and XRP, with more to be included in the coming months.
The firm revealed that UK Revolut retail account holders can seamlessly sign in to the newly created crypto exchange using their existing details. Customers can also trade crypto to fiat and vice versa between Revolut X and Revolut with zero fees.
Enhanced Accessibility
This consistent upgrade of the app and the launch of the crypto exchange show the company’s commitment to enhancing the accessibility and convenience of its customers. By creating a standalone exchange and offering a user-friendly interface, Revolut ensures its large customer base can seamlessly participate in the crypto market. This new feature will also enable traders to trade comfortably on the go. The educational resources within the Revolut app will also empower users with knowledge, creating responsible trading practices.
The bank’s commitment to providing top-tier crypto trading experiences is demonstrated in the words of Revolut Head of Crypto Exchange Product Leonid Bashlykov. He said:
“We are excited by the introduction of our new crypto product and believe this top-tier trading platform will change the game for experienced crypto traders, providing them with a safe and accessible place to trade.”
Before the launch, the digital bank had been making a series of improvements to its platform; recently, in collaboration with MetaMask, it introduced Revolut Ramp in March, which is aimed at making the purchase of cryptocurrency smooth and easy for its clients. This can also be accessed directly within MetaMask’s mobile app, browser extension, or on MetaMask Portfolio.
According to the release on their blog page, users of their platform can easily add to their MetaMask self-custody wallet with low fees by using their Revolut account, Visa, or Mastercard credit or debit bank card.

Shiba Inu Community Ignites Market with Massive SHIB Coin Burn, Price Surges Over 12%



                    

The Shiba Inu community has recently engaged in another significant burning of SHIB coins, a move that has seen a notable uptick in the cryptocurrency’s market price. 



A report from the Shibburn tracker has confirmed the commencement of this new burn phase, which has led to a substantial decrease in the number of SHIB coins in circulation, resulting in an over 12% increase in the coin’s price. 




This development has generated considerable excitement and speculation among investors and market watchers alike.



During this latest event, a remarkable total of 29,199,627 SHIB coins were permanently removed from circulation. 



The most substantial burn transactions included 14,943,135 and 10,006,280 SHIB coins respectively. 




This aggressive reduction in supply has significantly contributed to a soaring burn rate, which surged by an impressive 1,009% compared to the previous day.

Earlier in 2024, the SHIB team started testing a new automated coin burning mechanism on the Shibarium test network. 



This innovative system makes use of accumulated gas fees, converting a part of transaction fees paid in BONE tokens into SHIB, which are then sent to burn wallets, thus removing them from circulation permanently. 




This approach aims to establish a steady and automated method to support the coin’s value sustainably.



As these developments unfold, the community remains highly attentive to the timing and impact of future burns. 



Key figures like marketing officer Lucie and the creator, Ryoshi, have emphasized the critical role of community engagement in purchase transactions to ensure the continuity of these burns. 



Despite a recent dip in price following the surge, the strategic burning of SHIB is anticipated to play a pivotal role in its pricing strategy and market positioning moving forward.

Ethereum addresses rise, pushing ETH back to $3K - What's next? - AMBCrypto



Ethereum saw close to 350 new addresses in the last three days.
ETH volume has climbed over $13 billion.

Ethereum [ETH] recently experienced positive price movements, pushing its price back above the $3,000 mark. Concurrently, the number of addresses surged to levels not seen since 2022. 
Did this spike in new addresses lead to increased activity on the network?
Ethereum new addresses retest record number
According to data from Santiment, Ethereum experienced the highest daily new address creation between the 4th and the 5th of May, marking the first occurrence in nearly two years. 
The chart showed that the daily new address count was over 196,700, a milestone not seen since the 8th of October 2022. 
Source: Santiment
Subsequent analysis of the network growth chart revealed a gradual deceleration in this surge. 
By the close of trading on the 6th of May, the daily new address count had reduced to around 115,000, further declining to around 33,000 at the time of this writing. 
This influx is not unexpected, given Ethereum’s earlier flirtation with the $4,000 range this year. 
It’s plausible that the influx of these new addresses anticipates Ethereum’s potential to retest and surpass that price threshold. The last time there was an influx in Ocober 2022, the ETH price rose months later.
New Ethereum addresses yet to become active
Overall, the number of Ethereum daily active addresses has risen since March. Per AMBCrypto’s look at the chart below, it has consistently remained above 500,000, dipping below this threshold only occasionally. 
Source: Santiment
Specifically, on the 4th and 5th of May, the count was around 560,000 and 556,000, respectively, with no discernible trends observed. At the close of trade on 6th May, the count was 536,000.
 Also, as of this writing, the count was around 160,000. 
While this suggests a healthy level of activity on the network, the recent influx of new addresses has yet to impact it significantly. These new addresses may be content to observe from the sidelines for the time being.
Ethereum volume goes over $10 billion
AMBCrypto’s look at Ethereum’s volume revealed that the influx of new addresses did not lead to any significant changes in trading activity.

Realistic or not, here’s ETH market cap in BTC’s terms

The chart displayed a recent decline in volume, and even on the day of the spike in new addresses, the volume remained below $10 billion. 
It wasn’t until the 6th of May that the volume surpassed this threshold, going over $12 billion. As of the latest data, the volume was around $13 billion.

Arkham Found a New Bitcoin Wallet Owned by the US Government! How Much BTC Is In It? - Bitcoin Sistemi


Investors are curious about the BTC and altcoin portfolios of giant corporate companies that affect the Bitcoin price with their Bitcoin purchases and sales or moves, and especially the US Government, which is very effective on the price.
At this point, the cryptocurrency analysis company Arkham, which previously detected the Bitcoin wallets of Elon Musk's giant companies Tesla and Spacex, has now detected a new BTC wallet of the US Government.


Accordingly, Arkham identified the address where the Bitcoins seized by the US government from drug dealer Banmeet Singh during a hearing in January this year were located.
According to Arkham data, this address contains 3.94 thousand BTC (worth approximately $251 million).





Including the Bitcoins in the last detected wallet, the US government currently holds 216,811 thousand BTC (worth approximately $13.83 billion).

Australia tax authorities demand client data from crypto exchanges


The Australian Taxation Office (ATO) has recently requested personal data and transaction information from cryptocurrency exchanges, potentially involving up to 1.2 million accounts. This move aims to tighten enforcement against individuals who might be neglecting their tax obligations amidst the growing allure of digital tokens.
According to a notice issued by the ATO last month, the data is intended to assist in identifying traders who have not reported their crypto exchanges or the use of digital currency for purchases of goods and services. The ATO acknowledges the intricate nature of the crypto industry, which can contribute to a genuine lack of awareness regarding tax responsibilities.
The ATO highlighted concerns about the potential for individuals to exploit the anonymity of cryptocurrency transactions to evade tax obligations. It emphasized that the ease of purchasing crypto assets with false information could make them appealing to those seeking to circumvent tax laws.


What personal information does Australia want?
The information being sought includes personal details such as date of birth, phone numbers, and social media accounts, as well as transaction specifics like bank accounts, wallet addresses, and the type of cryptocurrency involved. 
In Australia, digital currencies are treated as assets for tax purposes rather than foreign currency, meaning investors are liable for capital gains tax on profits from selling crypto assets and on digital asset trades.
The popularity of crypto assets in Australia has been on the rise. A treasury report from 2022 revealed that over 800,000 Australian taxpayers had engaged in digital asset transactions in the preceding three years, with a significant 63% increase observed in 2021.
Since September 2022, Australia, which previously installed very few new crypto ATMs for years, has been steadily increasing its number of cryptocurrency ATMs. Currently, the country boasts a remarkable 1,007 of these machines, reflecting a significant expansion in accessibility to digital assets.

ETH Liquidation: 17K Tokens on Aave Protocol at Risk in the $2,800 Range | Cryptopolitan

Ethereum (ETH) proved resilient, easily bouncing above $3,000 after corrections in the past weeks. However, the token now sits in a risky space, within hundreds of dollars of a series of ETH liquidation levels.ETH traded around $3,070.30 on Tuesday, remaining within its tight range. Low-volume activity of around $13M in 24 hours is enough to keep ETH in its usual tight range. Liquidations are still happening across protocols and on centralized exchanges, despite precautions and automated mechanisms.But some price levels remain riskier than others. Decentralized protocols currently get sufficient support at many key price levels, but there are clusters that may be affected from relatively small corrections.Ethereum fluctuated easily between $2,900 and $3,300 in the past month, though sometimes showing significant short-term volatility.Aave Protocol Collateral to Liquidate Under $2,880.20An immediate and large liquidation cluster is now close to current price levels on Aave protocol. Other vaults and DeFi services are holding collaterals at much lower ETH levels accrued over the past years.Currently, around 17,167 ETH are at risk for liquidation if prices drop under the collateral level of $2,880.20.In addition to Aave, Maker DAO is exposed to ETH risk through its vaults, and has a series of liquidation levels below $2,700.A single wallet with 9,232.50 ETH is at risk of liquidation at $2,714.92. Those wallets and vaults at risk often resort to DeFi Saver, attempting to alert and prevent liquidations.DeFi Saver offers multiple vault controls through the Safe app, as a tool to monitor and automate DeFi risk exposure. ETH has shown it can easily dip to a lower range within a few days, often causing hundreds of millions of dollars in liquidations. One of the latest targets were Lido DAO addresses, which liquidated at the $3,080 range.In centralized trading, ETH liquidations remain relatively low, with mostly short positions liquidated in the past day.The past week was relatively stressful for traders, exposing the additional complexity of risk management tools.DeFi and LRT Have Sufficient CollateralsOne of the risks of early DeFi were the deep liquidations which cost many traders their collaterals. Currently, the Ethereum ecosystem is also padded by Liquid Staking Tokens, which often deviate from the price of ETH on exchanges, and may keep the ecosystem safer from liquidations.The recent market events were also far from previous series of $1B or more in liquidations daily.The Ethereum decentralized ecosystem is returning with a force in 2024. Various projects contain more than $54B in notional value, while producing $2.78M in fees each day. Nearly $25M in value enter Ethereum DeFi every day.ETH Traders Put Weight on Long PositionsShort liquidations diminished on Binance in the past few days. However, open interest on the ETHUSDT perpetual futures is growing.Open interest grew in the range of a day, up to $2.1B in notional value. Long positions dominated at more than 77.93% of all open interest, while market takers were predominantly buying ETH.Exchange reserves for ETH also indicate interest in withdrawals and buying. In the past 6-8 weeks, ETH reserves have been falling slowly, sliding under $13B in value. Peak selling happened at above $4,000 and since then, there are signs of accumulation.Ethereum is still used in re-staking. The Eigen protocol increased and consolidated its holdings above $15B in total value locked. Physical ETH tokens are still needed for staking, as well as for vaults and collateral wallets.On the other hand, the trend may reverse, as some whales may still seek to sell some of their ETH.Recently, wallet watchers also noticed one of the older pre-mine addresses move ETH for the first time in nearly nine years.

Poloniex Hacker Transfers 1100 ETH to Tornado Cash


							

The Poloniex hacker moved 1,100 ETH to Tornado Cash, as per PeckShield.



WuBlockchain confirmed that this is the first time the funds have been moved.



Poloniex was hacked in November of last year for $100 million.




A hacker involved in last year’s massive hack of Poloniex crypto exchange has reportedly transferred 1,100 Ethereum (ETH), valued at approximately $3.4 million, to the U.S.-sanctioned cryptocurrency mixer Tornado Cash in an attempt to launder the stolen funds. 



The movement of funds came to light following the on-chain data analysis conducted by security firm PeckShield. Notably, WuBlockchain also broke the news, confirming that this is the first time the hacker has transferred the funds to Tornado Cash to launder the money.



Poloniex, a major cryptocurrency exchange, fell victim to a substantial hack in November last year, resulting in the loss of $100 million from one of its hot wallets. Mixing services like Tornado Cash are often utilized by cybercriminals to obscure the trail of stolen cryptocurrency, making it harder for law enforcement agencies to track illicit transactions.









This attack on Poloniex is widely attributed to the North Korean Lazarus Group, a notorious state-sponsored hacking organization known for its involvement in various high-profile cyberattacks. 



In an unusual move, Poloniex offered the hacker a 5% bounty, amounting to around $5 million, to return the remaining 95% of the stolen funds. However, this attempt to negotiate with the hacker appears to have been unsuccessful, as evidenced by the recent transfer of ETH to Tornado Cash.



Poloniex has been a centralized exchange since its inception in 2014 and was later acquired by Tron founder Justin Sun in 2019. Notably, the hack dealt a significant blow to the exchange’s reputation and security measures.

Nigerian officials proposed secret crypto settlement, claims Binance CEO

New details have emerged suggesting Nigerian officials tried to coerce Binance representatives into a secret settlement paid in cryptocurrency during meetings in early 2024.Binance CEO Richard Teng issued a detailed account of Tigran Gambaryan’s ongoing detention on May7. Gambaryan is a former United States Internal Revenue Service agent who headed up Binance’s financial crime compliance team. Teng condemned the Nigerian government for its actions, claiming the country has “set a dangerous new precedent for all companies worldwide” after detaining two of its employees.Related: Arrested Binance exec pleads not guilty to charges in NigeriaGambaryan, who is a highly regarded figure in global financial crime prevention, was detained while on a business trip to Nigeria. Teng outlined the exchange’s efforts to engage constructively with Nigerian authorities, including participation in regulatory discussions and cooperation with law enforcement agencies.Request for public hearingAccording to Teng, Binance employees began discussions with Nigerian authorities during public investigative hearings following a request from the chairman of the House of Representatives Committee on Financial Crimes (HCFC).The committee is reported to have highlighted issues related to Binance’s operations in Nigeria and outlined the lengths to which they were prepared to summon Binance, including issuing arrest warrants against the exchange’s team and CEO and preventing its delegation from leaving the country. A public hearing was set for Jan. 10, and Binance was expected to respond to any allegations publicly in the presence of the petitioners, press and over 30 agencies. Teng claimed that Binance had not received details of the allegations, and the delegation sought to submit responses in writing in the absence of a public hearing. The committee chair said it would consider the request and respond to Binance’s legal counsel.Secret crypto settlementBinance’s CEO alleges that unknown persons approached the exchange’s employees and suggested making a payment in settlement of the allegations. Teng said Binance’s local counsel was handed over terms from an agent representing the HCFC committee:“Counsel reported back that he had been presented with a demand for a significant payment in cryptocurrency to be paid in secret within 48 hours to make these issues go away and that our decision was expected by the morning.”The exchange declined the payment demand through its local legal representation and continued its engagement in the settlement negotiations.

Despite being given safety assurances, Binance asserts that the pair were held against their will, and their passports and mobile phones were confiscated. Gambaryan remains detained, with the Nigerian government insisting that his release is contingent on Binance’s compliance with its demands. Binance has responded by shutting down certain services in Nigeria, hoping to resolve the situation and secure Gambaryan’s release.Magazine: Meme coins: Betrayal of crypto’s ideals… or its true purpose?

Shiba Inu (SHIB) Lead Shytoshi Kusama Shares Epic Mysterious Teaser


In a move that has set the Shiba Inu (SHIB) community ablaze with speculation, the enigmatic figure known as Shytoshi Kusama, lead of the popular cryptocurrency, has dropped a cryptic teaser on social media. Kusama's latest post features a gif with the word "Evita," a Spanish variant of the name Eva, meaning "life" or "living one," according to various dictionaries.Adding fuel to the fire, Kaal Dhairya, a key developer in the Shiba Inu ecosystem, also shared a similar post with the same word. The SHIB community is now buzzing with theories and conjectures, ranging from the possibility of a new partnership to the introduction of a new token alongside SHIB, BONE, LEASH and TREAT.While the true meaning behind Kusama's teaser remains elusive, this is not the first time the SHIB lead has teased the community with cryptic messages. Given his track record, it is unlikely that the answer will remain a mystery for long. Some speculate that the teaser may be related to the recent hard fork of Shibarium, the layer-2 blockchain solution from Shiba Inu. The upgrade, aimed at delivering faster transactions and more predictable gas fees, marks a significant milestone for the SHIB ecosystem. Last month, the Shiba Inu team emphasized the necessity of the hard fork to unlock next-level capabilities and improve usability and performance.As the SHIB community eagerly awaits further developments, with every new clue, speculation grows and the anticipation mounts. Stay tuned as the SHIB saga continues to unfold, one cryptic teaser at a time.

Bitcoin ETFs Ride The Bull Again: Second Straight Inflow Day


								The Spot Bitcoin ETF market is currently experiencing a resurgence, marked by a second consecutive day of positive inflows totaling $217 million. This increase in investment activity is a notable reversal from the previous weeks where inflows inflows stagnated since mid-March.
US Bitcoin ETFs Regain Momentum
Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC), a pioneer in crypto investment products, once again attracted capital with an inflow of $3.9 million. This positive trend for the second day in a row underlines that the outflows at GBTC may have come to a halt, which could remove significant selling pressure.
BlackRock’s IBIT also saw inflows for the second day in a row after seeing zero net inflows on six of the last seven days and one day of outflows, raising $21.5 million. Fidelity, another heavyweight in the financial sector, outshone others with the strongest inflows, drawing $99.2 million.

Other ETF providers like Bitwise, ARK, Invesco, Franklin, and VanEck also saw positive flows, although less pronounced compared to the leaders. Bitwise added $2.1 million, ARK impressed with $75.6 million, Invesco secured $11.1 million, while both Franklin and VanEck recorded $1.8 million each. This collective uptrend across diverse providers suggests a broad-based recovery in investor sentiment towards spot Bitcoin ETFs.


Bloomberg ETF specialist Eric Balchunas commented on the phenomenon, noting the rarity of uniformly positive inflows and the resilience of ETF investors. He said, “First time ever 1D flows all green, no red for the Bitcoin Bunch. Not going to spike the football like some did during the outflow period but will point out that over 95% of the ETF investors HOLD-ed during what was a pretty nasty and persistent downturn. Will same happen next time? Who knows, but track record says it will be pretty high % again. As we said, outflows will happen, so will inflows but over time two things tend to be true for ETFs: net growth and relatively strong hands.”

Adam Blumberg, the co-founder of Interaxis, commented on the mature behavior of ETF investors, emphasizing their long-term perspective and resilience to volatility. “ETF investors aren’t trading. They’re not degens. They expect the volatility, and in for the long term benefit. When they’re investing 1-5%, the short term downturns also have a minimal effect on overall portfolio,” he explained.
Adding to the optimism, a recent 13F filing revealed that Hightower, a $130 billion asset manager, purchased $68 million worth of spot Bitcoin ETFs. The diverse set of investments from Hightower in Bitcoin ETFs such as Grayscale, Fidelity, BlackRock, ARK, Bitwise, and Franklin Templeton illustrates a significant endorsement of Bitcoin from traditional financial institutions.


Hunter Horsley, CEO of Bitwise, reacted to the news of Hightower’s investment, indicating a positive outlook for the future interaction between traditional finance and Bitcoin. “Hightower is one of the largest RIA firms in the country, and highly admired. 2024 is going to have more & more stories of Bitcoin embraced by large traditional firms,” he remarked.
At press time, BTC traded at $64,273.

Crypto Whale Earns $3M in 4 Days - Bitcoin Trading Strategy Explained | Cryptoglobe


                                
In an astonishing display of market acumen, a crypto whale achieved a substantial profit of over $3 million in just four days. 



Initial Purchase and Withdrawal On May 3, amid a market downturn, the whale took a strategic position by purchasing 767 bitcoins when the prices were relatively low, paying an average price of $59,226 per BTC. This purchase was made from Coinbase, one of the most reputable cryptocurrency exchanges, amounting to a total investment of approximately $45.44 million. The decision to buy at this point was predicated on a sharp insight into market movements, pinpointing when Bitcoin hit what the whale perceived as a bottom price.



Subsequent Deposit and Sale Four days after the initial acquisition, as the market rebounded, the whale then transferred the same 767 BTC, now valued at $48.46 million, to Binance—another leading global cryptocurrency exchange. This transaction represents a clear intention to capitalize on the price recovery of Bitcoin over those four days. By depositing the Bitcoins into Binance, the whale positioned themselves to sell at a higher price, securing a profit that exceeds $3 million from this sequence of trades.







            
            

            
            

            
            

        

Address and Transparency The transaction details, including the Bitcoin address involved (1PGncMc8diiELpe4JAVCY51fcQ215JegAF), underscore the transparency and traceability inherent in blockchain technologies. This allows entities like Lookonchain to track and report on such movements, providing insights into how significant players are influencing the market dynamics.



Market Impact and Strategy This example of buying low and selling high showcases not only the individual trader’s prowess but also highlights how large-scale transactions can influence the broader cryptocurrency market. The whale’s ability to maneuver such large amounts of capital effectively and profitably emphasizes the sophistication and risks associated with high-stakes trading in digital assets.

Solana Hackathon: Ore Wins Despite Causing Bottlenecks


On May 6, Ore was named Grand Champion at the Solana Renaissance Hackathon, co-organized by Solana and Colosseum, winning a significant $50,000 prize. The project’s goal is to incorporate a unique proof-of-work algorithm into the Solana blockchain, which is aligned with the hackathon’s aim to introduce innovative projects to the ecosystem.
However, Ore’s victory attracted attention due to its mining system, which led to significant network bottlenecks within the Solana ecosystem in April 2024.
Ore’s Impact and Controversy within the Solana Ecosystem
Ore, envisioned by its pseudonymous creator, Hardhat Chad, offers a more egalitarian mining approach than Bitcoin’s competitive reward system. Such a system allows multiple miners to earn rewards.
This approach, dubbed “Bitcoin on Solana,” initially generated excitement but didn’t last long. The surge in Ore mining contributed to the congestion issue, which saw approximately 75% of transactions on the Solana network fail in April. The high volume of mining transactions generated by Ore’s novel mechanism causes delays and failures in transaction processing.

This led to a temporary halt in Ore’s mining activities. It also prompted a crucial network upgrade by Solana developers to alleviate the congestion.

The April issues were a pivotal learning moment for Solana and Ore. Solana’s team hastened a network upgrade to prevent future disruptions. 
They scheduled a significant update, version v1.18, for release on May 27 for its mainnet beta. This update aims at addressing ongoing congestion issues and strengthening the network’s infrastructure.
Meanwhile, Chad acknowledged the need for further development and testing before mining can resume.

“When these issues have been addressed and we have rebuilt the open-source client software for users, mining will resume. I expect this process to take a few weeks as we implement, test, and audit the changes. Ore will return. Until then, we’ll yearn for the mines,” Chad promised.

Goldman Sachs Shares Forecasts for How Many Rate Cuts Will Happen This Year and When - Bitcoin Sistemi


Goldman Sachs economists announced that they continue to predict two interest rate cuts this year, with the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting “mostly uneventful but dovish”.
The FOMC added a hawkish assessment to its statement that “no further progress has been made” on inflation so far this year. However, according to economists led by Jan Hatzius, President Powell gave a dovish message at the press conference.


“Our forecast remains unchanged and we continue to expect two rate cuts in July and November this year,” they added.

Economists emphasized that the most striking aspect of Powell's speech was that he took a strong step back against the idea of an interest rate increase. The Fed Chairman stated that a rise in policy rates “seems unlikely” and expressed confidence that current policy settings are restrictive enough.





Moreover, he noted that the Fed would need convincing evidence that it is not restrictive enough to consider a rate hike, and that evidence is not currently available.
“Powell hasn't given any major clues about the timing of the rate cut, but has consistently struck a dovish tone on inflation,” economists said.

Nigeria to ban peer-to-peer crypto trading in naira

The government of Nigeria is preparing to introduce new regulations to ban peer-to-peer (P2P) cryptocurrency exchange using the national currency, the Nigerian naira.Nigeria’s Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) is set to launch a new regulatory framework for crypto exchanges, custodians and other industry firms “in the coming days,” Bloomberg reported on May 7.According to SEC Director General Emomotimi Agama, the new regulations aim to delist the naira from P2P exchanges in order to protect the local currency from manipulation. He stated:“Recent concerns regarding crypto P2P traders and their perceived impact on the exchange rate of the naira has underscored the need for collective action.”The news follows a local ban issued to the global cryptocurrency exchange Binance and the arrests of its executives, Tigran Gambaryan and Nadeem Anjarwalla, in Nigeria in February 2024. Gambaryan, who has been jailed at the Kuje correctional center in Nigeria’s capital, Abuja, will go on trial on May 17, facing charges of tax evasion, currency speculation and money laundering.Major CEX platforms like Binance have their own P2P marketplaces, allowing users to switch between CEX and P2P when needed. However, Binance removed the naira from its P2P service as of March 2024 amid the Nigerian government launching a major crackdown on the exchange.Related: Ex-Binance CEO Changpeng Zhao sentenced to four months in prisonEven after removing the naira from its P2P service, Binance and its executives continued to face pressure from regulators in Nigeria, keeping Gambaryan arrested and jailed.On May 7, Binance CEO Richard Teng released detailed records of Gambaryan’s detention, condemning the Nigerian government for “setting a dangerous new precedent for all companies worldwide” after detaining two of its employees.Binance’s regulatory precedent in Nigeria and the planned P2P ban do not mean that P2P crypto trading will be gone for good in the country.Nigerians would apparently still be able to trade on P2P marketplaces using the U.S. dollar. According to some industry advocates, banning P2P is also not easy, if not impossible.Magazine: CZ gets jail sentence, Gensler viewed Ether as security, and FBI targets mixers: Hodler’s Digest, April 28 – May 4

Crypto DEX: How does the decentralized exchange GMX work?

In this article we explore GMX, a decentralized perpetual trading DEX that allows you to leverage up to 50X on various cryptos such as BTC, ETH, and many other altcoins.
In a short time, the platform has managed to become very famous in the DeFi world, thanks to its interesting features that allow you to operate in the encrypted markets in a very simple and efficient way.
Today GMX boasts a TVL of 500 million dollars and a cumulative volume of 200 billion dollars since its inception.
Let’s see all the details below.

GMX: the most popular decentralized perpetual crypto trading DEX in the world of DeFi
GMX is a decentralized DEX that allows spot and perpetual trading with up to 50x leverage on a wide range of cryptocurrencies such as BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, LINK, BNB, ARB, AVAX, NEAR, and many more.
Here users can exchange on-chain assets simply by connecting their non-custodial wallets, or they can act as liquidity providers by locking collateral for trades and earning trading fees.
Initially born from anonymous founders under the name Gambit Finance and launched on the BNB Chain, it was then renamed GMX and launched on the layer-2 of Ethereum Arbitrum in September 2021.
Today it has also expanded to Avalanche and has become extremely popular in DeFi, especially among those users looking for an efficient and high-performance decentralized platform.
The numbers speak for themselves: as of May 6, 2024 GMX has a volume in the last 7 days of 1.25 billion dollars, a cumulative volume of 199 billion dollars, a TVL of 436 million dollars and cumulative fees collected of 308 million dollars

From a technical point of view, GMX has introduced a new way of conceiving decentralized trading on DEX.
First of all, rather than opting for the classic architecture of DEX with dual token pools, GMX uses a single liquidity pool composed of 50% stablecoins (USDC, USDT, DAI, FRAX) and the remaining 50% of various tokens such as ETH and BTC.
All users who trade on the platform draw from this pool of cryptographic resources, within which the value of individual coins is secured by the price feed of Chainlink oracles, which ensures accuracy and reliability of the data.
This type of multi-asset pool is community-owned and is alternatively referred to as GLP: LP providers, by locking their coins on GMX, receive a corresponding amount of the GLP token representing their share of the provided liquidity.  
Subsequently, the protocol automatically stakes the newly minted GLP tokens. 
It is worth noting that those who provide liquidity to the decentralized trading DEX receive 70% of the trading fees in the form of esGMX tokens (a resource that guarantees the same rewards as GMX) and ETH or AVAX depending on the network, while the remaining 30% is offered to the platform’s stakers.
It is very important to underline how simplicity, intuitiveness, and immediacy of operations have been winning features for GMX, allowing the protocol to be used by the entire DeFi community, even among less experienced users. In addition, traders benefit from zero price impact and very low trading fees compared to the industry average.

GMX crypto: on-chain analysis
The newly introduced decentralized trading DEX also features a governance crypto, which bears the same name as the platform, namely GMX.
Token holders of GMX can participate in discussions regarding project developments by voting on governance proposals through their share of influence.
At the same time, however, crypto can also be locked in stake to take advantage of high yields. In particular, GMX stakers receive three types of rewards: multiplier points (points that reward long-term holders), GMX deposited as collateral, and rewards in ETH or AVAX depending on the originating chain.
The multiplier points, obtained at an APR of 100% compared to the amount deposited, then allow you to earn additional commissions.
However, at the moment, on the price front, the GMX token is not sailing in good waters as it is being traded with a drawdown of about 70% compared to the highs of April 2023.
In the last 10 weekly candles on the GMX-USDT trading pair, we can observe how 9 of these are bearish while only one hints at a timid green.

The weakness of the GMX token; after going through a bear market impeccably managing to stand out from all other cryptos, is also mainly due to the entry into the market of decentralized perpetual DEX competitor Hyperliquid.
This latest platform, driven by the trend of a possible airdrop of a proprietary token, has grown significantly in recent months, managing to capture part of GMX’s market share.
Just think that at the beginning of the year GMX had a market share of about 18% while at the end of April it recorded only a share of 3.5%.

It should also be noted that some of the historical investors in the GMX project and token have recently dumped all their “bags”, liquidating their holdings in the cryptocurrency.
In particular, we highlight how Arthur Hayes, a well-known crypto billionaire and founder of BitMEx, until a few months ago held tens of millions of dollars in GMX while at the beginning of April he sold all the tokens he owned.
Approximately 237,674 GMX have been sold since April 8th. This has definitely had a negative impact on the asset’s price action.

Macro Expert Names Four Catalysts That Could Trigger ‘Historic’ Stock Market Melt-Up This Year - The Daily Hodl


								David Hunter, the chief macro strategist at Contrarian Macro Advisors, thinks the stock market could be on the verge of a “historic” rally.
In a new interview with journalist David Lin, Hunter outlines the catalysts he thinks will drive a jump in equities prices.










“Part of the melt-up will be lower rates. I think we will get back to recognizing that inflation is trending down and moving towards that 2% target, so that will be received bullishly. I think you will see earnings look like they’re turning up, so you’re going to see increased earning expectations over the course of the next six months and estimates for next year starting to be hiked.”
The macroeconomic expert also thinks a market reversal will force the entry of investors who have been waiting on the sidelines hoping for a more significant dip in stock prices.
“So you’ll get FOMO (fear of missing out) kicking in. There’s a lot of skepticism out there: people didn’t believe the market when it moved from 3,500 to 4,600, then when it went back to 4,100 last October, they didn’t jump on there. They only jumped on and began to jump on when it got to new highs.”
The S&P 500 Index is trading at 5,180.74 at time of writing, according to MarketWatch.

Binance CEO Demands Release of Employee Detained in Nigeria - Decrypt

Binance CEO Richard Teng has demanded the release of the exchange's executive Tigran Gambaryan from detention in Nigeria, where he has been held for more than 70 days.In a blog post, Teng said that Gambaryan's detention "has set a dangerous new precedent for all companies worldwide," adding that he "is innocent and must be released."Gambaryan, the exchange's Head of Financial Crime Compliance, was detained in February by Nigerian authorities alongside his colleague, Binance's regional manager for Africa Nadeem Anjarwalla. The pair had traveled to the country to liaise with officials as they conducted an investigation into crypto exchanges.Both Binance execs were initially held without charge under the terms of a court order, before Anjarwalla escaped what Teng characterized as "unlawful detention". The pair, along with the exchange, were subsequently charged with tax evasion by Nigeria's Federal Inland Revenue Service (FIRS), while Gambaryan was transferred to a jail run by the country's anti-corruption agency.According to local media, Nigeria is seeking the extradition of Anjarwalla; a spokesperson for his wife subsequently claimed that reports of his arrest in Kenya are false.In his blog post, Teng emphasized that Gambaryan was visiting Nigeria as a "functional expert in financial crime and capacity building in policy discussions," and did not go to the country as a "'decision-maker,' nor a "negotiator.'"The Binance CEO also published a detailed breakdown of the exchange's activities in Nigeria over the past two years, and its negotiations with Nigerian lawmakers and regulators.Nigeria is currently undergoing a currency crisis, which Teng claims had been attributed by local authorities to Binance's activities in the country.As well as pushing back against those claims, he alleged that Gambaryan, an "innocent, mid-level employee," is being held in "a dangerous prison in order to control Binance." Gambaryan has sued the Nigerian government for violating his fundamental human rights.Teng claimed that Gambaryan and Anjarwalla had "received multiple assurances that they would be granted safe passage for their meetings," and that in the course of a "hostile" meeting, members of Nigeria's Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) demanded that the exchange delist the Nigerian naira from its platform and "provide granular-level detail on all Nigerian users."Following their detention, Teng said, Gambaryan and Anjarwalla were subject to "aggressive behavior" and were personally accused of "holding responsibility for the state of the naira and the overall economy," as well as allegations of terrorist financing and money laundering.Decrypt has reached out to the EFCC for comment and will update this article should they respond.As a "good faith gesture," Teng stated that Binance had delisted the naira and disabled its P2P product for Nigerian users, and urged the country's authorities to release Gambaryan and continue its "engagement" with the exchange over tax liabilities and cooperation with law enforcement."I hope that my next update is one where our employees are safe at home with their families," Teng added.Edited by Stacy Elliott.Stay on top of crypto news, get daily updates in your inbox.

KuCoin Strengthens Security with Bugcrowd Partnership to Launch Bug Bounty Program - Coin Edition


							

KuCoin partners with Bugcrowd to launch a bug bounty program to enhance security across its trading platform.



The program targets critical vulnerabilities in web and mobile modules, with rewards of up to $10,000 for extreme issues.



High-severity findings receive rewards up to $2,000, while medium-severity discoveries are rewarded up to $400.




The prominent global crypto exchange KuCoin has partnered with Bugcrowd, the leading crowdsourced cybersecurity platform, to enhance platform security. KuCoin announced this new security-focused collaboration in a recent press statement seen by Coin Edition.



The collaboration marks the launch of an extensive bug bounty program designed to identify and rectify potential vulnerabilities across KuCoin’s platform. The program focuses on pinpointing critical vulnerabilities in web and mobile modules.



Regarding the web modules, issues such as business logic flaws, payment manipulation risks, remote code execution, and sensitive information leakage are among the targeted vulnerabilities. Additionally, the program addresses a spectrum of OWASP issues, such as Cross-Site Scripting (XSS), SQL Injection, and others.









However, on the mobile front, the focus shifts to vulnerability functions capable of accessing unsafe external links. It includes potential exploitations of the “Jsbridge/Javascript interface” that could harm users and other mobile-related susceptibilities that could result in potential losses.



KuCoin and Bugcrowd have established a tiered reward system based on the severity of identified vulnerabilities to incentivize security researchers and reward their efforts. The rewards range from $10,000 for extreme severity to $50 for low severity issues.



Specifically, detected extreme severity issues are rewarded with $10,000, and critical severity vulnerabilities range from $3,000 to $5,000. Moreover, high-severity findings receive rewards ranging from $1,000 to $2,000, while medium-severity discoveries are rewarded between $200 and $400. Low-severity issues merit rewards varying from $50 to $100.



Johnny Lyu, CEO of KuCoin, emphasized the exchange’s commitment to prioritizing the security of user assets and transactions. Lyu remarked:




As People’s Exchange, the security of users’ assets is always our top priority. Ensuring the safety of user assets and transactions is an ongoing endeavor to which we are committed.




Bugcrowd CEO Dave Gerry echoed Lyu’s sentiments, highlighting the importance of trust and security in the cryptocurrency market. “We’re excited to partner with KuCoin to launch their Bug Bounty Program to achieve a safer trading environment for all users,” Gerry remarked.

From The Deep: Bitcoin Whale Emerges After A Decade, Millions On The Move


								A digital Lazarus has risen from the blockchain graveyard. After a decade of slumber, a Bitcoin wallet, presumed lost to the mists of internet history, stirred back to life on May 6th, 2024. This prehistoric beast, a “whale” in crypto terminology due to its massive holdings, sent ripples through the market by transferring a staggering 687 BTC, valued at nearly $44 million.

Bitcoin Through Time: From Humble Beginnings To Whopping Returns
The now-famous wallet first received its Bitcoin haul in January 2014, a time when the fledgling cryptocurrency was still finding its footing. Back then, 687 BTC cost a mere $630,000, a stark contrast to the multi-million dollar transaction it facilitated this week. This incredible price appreciation serves as a potent reminder of the crypto asset’s meteoric rise over the years.


Bitcoin’s Dominating Presence: A Cornerstone Of Crypto
At the time of writing, BTC was trading at $63,765, down 1.2% in the last 24 hours, and sustained a meager 0.6% gain in the last seven days, data from Coingecko shows.
Bitcoin remains the undisputed king of the cryptocurrency realm. Its daily trading volume regularly surpasses $20 billion, solidifying its position as the cornerstone of the digital asset market.

However, the recent months have been a rollercoaster ride for Bitcoin investors. A robust bull run that began in 2024 hit a snag in April when economic factors and a controversial token sale sent shockwaves through the market. Bitcoin dipped below $57,000, marking its first monthly loss in nearly a year.

Bitcoin is now trading at $63.765. Chart: TradingView
Bitcoin Price On A Tightrope: Bullish Signal Or Distribution In Disguise?
With the recent whale movement and Bitcoin’s nascent recovery, speculation is rife about the future course of its price. Some analysts view this large-scale transfer as a bullish indicator, suggesting that investors still see significant growth potential in Bitcoin.



Others sound a cautionary note. They worry that the transaction might be a sign of “distribution,” where early adopters are cashing out on their skyrocketing profits. This, they argue, could trigger a price decline in the near future.
Bitcoin At A Crossroads: Re-accumulation Or Retracement?
The coming days and weeks could be pivotal for Bitcoin. Its price currently sits at a critical juncture. If Bitcoin manages to reclaim the $60,000 mark by the end of the week, it could be interpreted as a sign of re-accumulation, suggesting that investors are buying back in, potentially propelling the bull run further.
But if it doesn’t succeed in doing so and ends the week below its peak, that would be interpreted as a negative signal that could lead to a more significant decline.

Nigeria Bans P2P Crypto Trading, Cites Naira Concerns


Nigeria’s Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has announced plans to ban peer-to-peer (P2P) crypto trading in a significant regulatory move. This development comes amidst a broader crackdown that includes the arrest of two Binance executives.
Indeed, Nigerian regulators’ enforcement is escalating tensions within the crypto sector. It also stirs concerns among global crypto entities about the regulatory environment in the region.
Nigeria to Tighten Regulations as Binance Case Continues
Emomotimi Agama, Director General of the SEC, expressed serious concerns about the effects of P2P trading on the Nigerian naira. Agama emphasized the urgency of these measures to stabilize the national currency.

“The thing that needs to be done is delisting the naira from the P2P space in order to avoid the level of manipulation that is currently happening. […] Recent concerns regarding crypto P2P traders and their perceived impact on the exchange rate of the naira has underscored the need for collective action,” Agama said.


Peer-to-peer platforms allow direct trading between crypto investors and bypass intermediaries. Therefore, the method may have raised concerns for the regulators in Nigeria.
Additionally, Nigerian officials have previously alleged that Binance and several other crypto exchanges engaged in fixing dollar prices. These prices did not refer to the price of the Nigerian naira at the central bank.
This ultimately made speculators take a chance and make prices on crypto exchanges the standard price used for foreign exchange trading. The issue is particularly noteworthy, considering Nigeria has been battling with inflation.

As Nigeria grapples with economic instability, the SEC’s approach aims to rein in activities perceived as threats to financial security. This initiative extends to upcoming regulations targeting crypto exchanges and digital asset custodians.
The regulatory body’s aggressive posture was highlighted earlier this year following the ban on Binance operations and the subsequent detention of its top executives, Tigran Gambaryan and Nadeem Anjarwalla. Although Anjarwalla managed to flee, Gambaryan has been arrested in Abuja. He is also facing charges, including tax evasion and money laundering, which will lead him to go on trial this month.

In response to the ongoing case between the company and the Nigerian SEC, Richard Teng, CEO of Binance, has publicly demanded Gambaryan’s release. In an open letter published on May 7, Teng criticizes the Nigerian authorities for setting a “dangerous precedent” for global corporate engagements. Furthermore, Teng defended Gambaryan’s integrity and professional background, particularly his global contributions to combating financial crime.

“It is important to note that Tigran did not go to Nigeria as a ‘decision-maker,’ nor a ‘negotiator.’ He was merely acting as a functional expert in financial crime and capacity building in policy discussions,” Teng stated.

This is not the first time Binance has publicly called for their executives’ release. In early April 2024, Binance collectively published a statement to “respectfully request that Tigran Gambaryan is not held responsible while current discussions are ongoing between Binance and Nigerian government officials.”

Tom Brady Ridiculed for FTX and Crypto Investments in Netflix Roast - Decrypt

We do the research, you get the alpha!Get exclusive reports and access to key insights on airdrops, NFTs, and more! Subscribe now to Alpha Reports and up your game!Go to Alpha ReportsStar NFL quarterback Tom Brady took a lot of flak for his crypto investments during a 3-hour live Netflix comedy roast on Sunday."The Roast of Tom Brady," which was recorded and is still available to watch on the streaming platform, featured a number of pointed jokes about Brady's affinity for Bitcoin and his ties to bankrupt crypto exchange FTX. And it didn't take long for the crypto jokes to show up, either.Within the first five minutes of the comedy special, host and comedian Kevin Hart addressed what he cast as the elephant in the room."Now, right now, I know what you guys are probably asking yourselves. You're saying, 'Guys, why didn't we go to the Crypto.com Arena downtown? The reason we didn't go there is because we didn't want to remind Tom's fans of how much money he owes them," Hart said. "He fucked those people. Tom fucked those people."Hart seemed to be alluding to Brady's time spent as a spokesperson for Crypto.com's former competitor, FTX.It only feels fair to point out that Hart has had his own crypto mishaps. He recently sold his Bored Ape Yacht Club NFT for at an 83% loss, and in 2019 was named as a defendant in a $7 million class-action lawsuit over the allegedly fraudulent ICO of crypto project FLiK.Brady and his ex-wife, supermodel Gisele Bündchen, announced that they had taken an equity stake in FTX in 2021. The celebrity couple appeared in a series of commercials and at live events with FTX founder—and convicted felon—Sam Bankman-Fried.But after the exchange collapsed, it was announced they had been paid their $30 million fee almost entirely in FTT, the official token of FTX that crashed spectacularly right before FTX filed for bankruptcy. Now, because of their work to promote FTX, both Brady and Bündchen have been named in a class action lawsuit from FTX investors and client that seeks to hold them accountable for encouraging people to use the exchange.Several celebrities have already reached settlements, including Jacksonville Jaguars quarterback Trevor Lawrence, and YouTube influencers Tom Nash and Kevin Paffrath. But Brady and Bündchen are still defendants in the case.Which is why, perhaps, Brady appeared visibly unsettled when comedian Nikki Glaser ridiculed him for having done business with FTX."Tom also lost $30 million in crypto. Tom, how did you fall for that? Even Gronk was like, 'Me know that not real money.'," Glaser said. "Gronk actually does Bitcoin, which is where he just chews on a handful of nickels."The "Gronk" she was referring to is NFL tight end Rob Gronkowski, Brady's longtime teammate. At one point in 2021, Gronkowski announced that he'd joined Brady's Autograph NFT platform.Stay on top of crypto news, get daily updates in your inbox.

Australian Tax Office seeks data from 1.2 million crypto exchange users: Report

Australia’s tax office reportedly seeks personal data and transaction details from up to 1.2 million cryptocurrency exchange users for a potential crackdown on crypto tax obligations.The Australian Taxation Office (ATO) said that the data will help identify traders who may have failed to pay their taxes on their crypto trades, according to a notice issued last month seen by Reuters.The ATO will be seeking personal data including users’ date of birth, social media accounts, and phone numbers, as well as transaction-related details like wallet addresses, type of coins trades, and bank account details.For Australian regulators, cryptocurrencies are taxable assets, unlike other foreign currencies. This requires traders to pay a capital gains tax on the profit from sold crypto assets.The news of the potential tax collection crackdown comes during a highly profitable time for crypto investors. Bitcoin (BTC) rallied over 44% since the beginning of the year, while Ether (ETH) rose 32% year-to-date (YTD). BTC, ETH, Total altcoin market cap, YTD.

The new bill is expected to provide a legal foundation for crypto taxes in Turkey, which is a leading crypto economy.In the United States regulators are aiming to raise the long-term capital gains tax rate to 44.6%, but only for investors earning over $1 million a year.The same Federal Budget proposal from the Biden administration also included a 25% tax on unrealized gains for ultra-high-net-worth individuals.“For 99.9% of people, it’s a big, fat nothing burger because it’s essentially just a proposal,” Matthew Walrath, founder of Crypto Tax Made Easy, told Cointelegraph.VIDEOHow Blockchain Data Is Used to Save on Taxes | Lukka Co-CEO Explains.

Can Legal Battles Secure the Future of Crypto in the US?


							

Robinhood receives a Wells notice from the SEC for likely enforcement action.



Its CEO, Vlad Tenev, vows to take legal action against the SEC if necessary.



Coinbase CEO disagrees that legal battles can secure the future of crypto; advocates for pro-crypto political candidates.




The future of crypto in the United States is shrouded in uncertainty due to the ongoing regulatory difficulties American crypto companies face. As a result, leading crypto businesses are moving to challenge U.S. regulators through legal means.



However, doubts persist regarding the efficacy of the judicial system in providing timely and lasting solutions. Brian Armstrong, the CEO of Coinbase, and Vlad Tenev, the CEO of Robinhood, recently expressed their views on this subject.



In a recent post in X, Tenev noted that the crypto industry has faced relentless regulatory pressure detrimental to American companies and consumers for the past three years. 



He highlighted the U.S. SEC’s persistent scrutiny of crypto and recent proposals, such as those concerning predictive data analytics, as yet another instance of government overreach hindering innovation.







Notably, this commentary surfaces amid Robinhood receiving a Wells notice from the SEC on Monday regarding the crypto assets traded on its platform. The Wells notice is a formal notification that the SEC often sends when it intends to initiate enforcement proceedings. 



Meanwhile, the CEO committed to fostering positive relationships with the U.S. regulator. However, he asserted that Robinhood is prepared to allocate resources to challenge the regulatory actions in court if necessary. The firm seeks to safeguard its crypto business and establish regulatory clarity in the United States for the benefit of its customers.









However, in response, Brian Armstrong, the CEO of Coinbase, shared an opposing view. He first welcomed Tenev to the fold of industry pundits, taking a stance against the onslaught of American crypto firms.



In parallel, Armstrong acknowledged the potential role of the courts in clarifying regulatory ambiguity. However, the Coinbase CEO emphasized that electing pro-crypto candidates in the upcoming elections is essential for achieving a lasting solution. He does not see court actions as sufficient to safeguard the industry.







Accordingly, Coinbase is taking a proactive stance in the political arena by being one of the major contributors to a super PAC that champions pro-crypto politicians. Specifically, Coinbase has donated $24.5 million to Fairshake, a super PAC dedicated to this cause.

Is XRP a Banana or an Apple? A Reddit User Breaks Down the SEC v. Ripple Saga | Cryptoglobe


                                
The ongoing legal battle between Ripple and the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) over the classification of the XRP token has captured widespread attention in the cryptocurrency community. To shed light on this complex issue, a user on the XRP subreddit ingeniously simplified the dispute using a memorable analogy, which has resonated with many for its clarity and humor.



In a Reddit discussion sparked by a user’s request for a simple explanation of the Ripple vs. SEC case, another user provided a creative and illustrative metaphor:



Ripple is portrayed as a Monkey, holding what it sees as a banana.The Banana represents XRP as a commodity, which Ripple maintains should not be regulated as a security.The SEC, depicted as a Gorilla, insists that the banana is actually an apple.The Apple symbolizes the SEC’s classification of XRP as a security, requiring oversight and regulation.The Lion, representing the U.S. court system, particularly Judge Analisa Torres, has the final say in determining the nature of XRP.



This metaphor not only highlights the essence of the legal arguments but also captures the conflicting perspectives in a way that’s easy to grasp for those unfamiliar with legal jargon.



The SEC initiated a lawsuit against Ripple in December 2020, alleging that Ripple conducted an unregistered securities offering by selling XRP. Ripple countered by arguing that XRP is a digital currency and should not be treated as a security.







            
            

            
            

            
            

        

On July 13, 2023, Judge Analisa Torres ruled that “XRP, as a digital token, is not in and of itself a ‘contract, transaction[,] or scheme’ that embodies the Howey requirements of an investment contract.” This ruling was a significant win for Ripple as it supported their argument that XRP is more akin to a commodity than a security.



This landmark decision has far-reaching implications for the cryptocurrency industry in the United States. It could influence how other cryptocurrencies are viewed and regulated by federal agencies, potentially fostering a more favorable environment for innovation and growth in the sector.



Currently, the SEC is seeking $2 billion in remedies from Ripple. In response, Ripple has contended that a sum no greater than $10 million would be appropriate. The SEC is expected to respond this week. It is anticipated that Judge Torres will make a ruling on the remedies sometime this summer.

                        Crypto wallet developer Exodus Movement has received approval to list its common stock on the NYSE under the ticker EXOD.Trading for the stock will commence on the platform on May 9, the company announced on Monday. “Trading on the NYSE American will allow Exodus to create greater long-term value for our stockholders by increasing our presence within the investor community and, in turn, increase liquidity,” Exodus CEO and Co-founder JP Richardson said. “We believe the uplisting will broaden the awareness of Exodus.”Exodus to Enhance Market Presence With NYSE Listing
NYSE American, formerly known as the American Stock Exchange (AMEX), focuses on companies with smaller market capitalization compared to the main NYSE. By moving to the NYSE American, Exodus aims to enhance its market presence and attract more investors.The EXOD stock is already listed on the OTCQX market, and the recent approval paves the way for Exodus’ stocks to be “uplisted” to the NYSE. The company told existing stockholders that no action was required prior to the NYSE American listing.Founded in 2015, Exodus Movement specializes in developing self-custodial wallet services for cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin, Ether, and other digital assets. Notably, the company has tokenized its EXOD security tokens, which represent Class A EXOD common shares, on the Algorand blockchain. These tokens can be managed using Exodus wallets. Exodus claims to be the only U.S.-based company that has its common stock tokenized on the blockchain.According to Exodus’ preliminary review for the first quarter of 2024, the company achieved a revenue of $29.1 million, marking a significant 118% increase compared to the same period last year. Additionally, Exodus reported having approximately 1.69 million monthly active users during the first quarter.zkSNACKs Bans U.S. Users from Wasabi Wallet and Other Services
Exodus’ move to list its common stock on the NYSE American comes as ACINQ’s Phoenix Wallet and zkSNACKs’ Wasabi Wallet have discontinued their services for customers in the United States. The move came as a response to the recent crackdown on self-custodial cryptocurrency wallet providers by regulatory agencies. Both companies have expressed concerns about the classification of self-custodial wallet providers as legitimate money service businesses following actions taken against Consensys, the creator of Metamask, and crypto mixer Samourai Wallet.The recent regulatory focus on self-custodial wallets stems from concerns that they may facilitate illicit activities such as money laundering. Consensys, the creator of MetaMask, received a Wells notice from the SEC on April 10, which warned of potential enforcement actions related to its MetaMask Swaps and MetaMask Staking products. In another incident, the co-founders of Samourai Wallet, a cryptocurrency mixer, were arrested on charges of money laundering brought by the U.S. Justice Department and other agencies. Samourai Wallet CEO Keonne Rodriguez and chief technology officer William Hill are facing charges of conspiracy to commit money laundering and conspiracy to operate an unlicensed money transmitting business.

The Security Of DeFi: A Deep Dive

Decentralized finance (DeFi) has revolutionized the industry by eliminating intermediaries and creating a more inclusive and accessible system for financial services. But as the ecosystem grows rapidly, the security of DeFi has become an issue. With monetary value at stake, it is crucial to address vulnerabilities and risks associated with DeFi platforms. This article thoroughly examines the security aspects of DeFi delving into the challenges it poses, recommended practices for risk mitigation, and potential solutions to establish a trustworthy decentralized financial ecosystem.
To maintain user trust and confidence in DeFi, addressing security challenges is essential. Key management compromises, coding errors, smart contract related risks, rug pulls (exit scams) inadequate regulatory frameworks, reliance on certain centralized components oracle manipulations, and simple human error are among the cybersecurity risks faced by DeFi.
To mitigate these risks within DeFi applications implementing various solutions can be beneficial. These include undergoing audits conducted by trusted parties or experts in the field of cybersecurity, utilizing multi-signature wallets for enhanced protection, enforcing proper access controls to limit unauthorized activities, and adopting secure coding practices to minimize vulnerabilities. To properly assess the security of DeFi it is crucial to evaluate the contracts and conduct audits on the underlying infrastructure and inherited components.
Understanding The Basics Of Security of DeFi
Before delving into DeFi security aspects, let’s first understand the concept of Decentralized Finance. 

DeFi stands for Decentralized Finance, a cutting-edge system that operates on a decentralized network often leveraging blockchain technology. 

Unlike financial systems that depend on intermediaries like banks or financial institutions, DeFi empowers individuals to directly access financial services without any intermediaries.
One key advantage of DeFi is its permissionless nature. Anyone with an internet connection can participate in DeFi and use a wide range of financial services such as lending, borrowing, trading, and investing. Additionally, the decentralized nature of DeFi ensures that no single entity has control over the system. This makes it resistant to censorship while granting users financial freedom.
At the heart of DeFi lies smart contracts—self-executing agreements with predefined terms written directly into code. Smart contracts automate transaction execution eliminating intermediaries and enabling trustless interactions between parties. This not only reduces transaction costs but also enhances security and transparency within the financial system.
The Risks And Vulnerabilities Associated With Security Of DeFi
Even though DeFi offers an approach to finance, it is not without its fair share of risks and vulnerabilities. Because decentralized finance relies on networks and heavily depends on contracts it becomes susceptible to various security challenges. It is crucial to understand these risks in order to mitigate them and ensure a more secure decentralized financial ecosystem.
Bugs and Vulnerabilities in Contracts
Smart contracts play an important role in DeFi as they automate financial transactions. However, they can still have flaws or loopholes that attackers may exploit. These vulnerabilities can result in losses or manipulation of transactions.
To address this risk developers should prioritize conducting audits and testing of contracts to identify and resolve potential flaws or weaknesses. Additionally adhering to security practices like code reviews and formal verification can enhance the integrity and resilience of contracts.
Hacking Incidents
Usually, DeFi platforms are targeted by hackers as a large amount of funds is involved. These types of attacks can lead to theft, manipulation, or disruptions in services. 
In order to safeguard ourselves against such hacking incidents DeFi platforms should implement security measures like using authentication factors, conducting security audits, and implementing encryption protocols. 

As DeFi disrupts systems by operating in an open and permissionless manner it may face regulatory and compliance challenges. Governments and regulatory bodies might try to impose regulations or restrictions on DeFi platforms, which can impact their operations and the privacy of their users.
Impermanent Losses

Impermanent loss means the decrease in funds that occurs when a liquidity provider adds funds to a pool and the value of those assets changes compared to their deposit value. 

To minimize impermanent loss one can consider using stablecoins with fixed values of coins when providing liquidity to pools. Additionally utilizing liquidity pools, with ratios can also help reduce these losses. The term “impermanent” is used because these losses only become permanent when you withdraw your coins from the liquidity pool. However, at that point, the losses do indeed become permanent.
To tackle risks effectively DeFi platforms should collaborate with regulatory bodies proactively while implementing compliance measures. These measures can encompass procedures like Know Your Customer (KYC) money laundering (AML) precautions and ensuring adherence to local regulations.

How To Protect Yourself From DeFi Scams And Hacks
DeFi scams and hacks can be prevented by implementing various security measures. 

Here are some best practices to protect yourself from DeFi scams and hacks.

Reentrancy Attacks
Be aware of reentrancy attacks and ensure that your smart contracts are coded correctly. A reentrancy attack is a type of smart contract vulnerability where an exploiter contract leverages the loophole of the victim contract to continuously withdraw from it until the victim contract goes bankrupt.
Wallet Security
Use wallets carefully and selectively. It is important to back up and safely store your seed phrase. Use a hardware wallet for your long-term investments that you make as secure as possible and never save, copy, or use its seed phrase on a device connected to the internet.
Smart Contract Audits
Conduct a thorough smart contract audit before deploying smart contracts on the mainnet. A smart contract security audit examines the smart contracts of a project in depth and is necessary to protect the monies invested through them.
Recognizing Red Flags
Be aware of common red flags that indicate a DeFi protocol might, in fact, be a scam or operate on fraudulent activities. For example, if an offer sounds too good to be true, it’s best to decline to avoid a potential scam.
Bug Bounty Programs
Participate in bug bounty programs to identify vulnerabilities and flaws before deploying smart contracts. Bug bounty programs offer rewards to individuals who identify and report security vulnerabilities in software.
By implementing these best practices, you can protect yourself from DeFi scams and hacks.
The Future of Security of DeFi and Emerging Trends
The global DeFi market size was valued at USD 13.61 Billion in 2022 and is expected to expand at a staggering compound annual growth rate of 46.0% from 2023 to 2030.
Some of the emerging trends in DeFi include the following:

The push toward real-world assets
Greater stablecoin adoption
Focus on layer-2 scaling and ZK technology
Security and compliance 
Privacy-focused DeFi services

Additionally, there is a growing demand for DeFi insurance policies, and the integration of traditional finance in DeFi is expected to enhance the traditional financial system to blockchain networks’ security, efficiency, and transparency.
Conclusion
To sum up, the changing world of decentralized finance (DeFi) has brought about exciting opportunities to reshape the financial industry. At it’s core, DeFi eliminates intermediaries and makes financial services more accessible aiming to create a more inclusive financial landscape. However along with its potential DeFi also faces various security challenges that require attention and has innovative solutions.
Throughout our exploration, we have delved into the realm of security of DeFi. We have examined the core elements of DeFi, understood the risks and vulnerabilities involved, and recognized the importance of security of defi. As DeFi platforms become more intricate so are the risks involved. This emphasizes the need to safeguard investments and maintain user trust.
In order to address these vulnerabilities effectively it is crucial for DeFi platforms to prioritize contract audits conduct thorough testing procedures and establish rigorous security of defi practices. Collaboration with bodies will play a vital role in finding a balance between DeFi’s decentralized nature and regulatory compliance. This will ensure that the ecosystem remains legitimate and sustainable in the run.
Furthermore, as the DeFi landscape continues to expand it is essential for users to adopt best practices to protect themselves from scams and hacks. Staying vigilant in making decisions when participating in DeFi projects or investments is key.
Looking ahead into the future of security of DeFi shows promise. Given the projected growth the industry is set to explore new possibilities by integrating real-world assets improving scalability and privacy and bridging the gap between traditional finance and the blockchain domain. As innovative solutions emerge and the DeFi ecosystem matures the combined efforts of platforms, developers, regulators, and users will shape a financial landscape that is secure, transparent, and prosperous.

As we move ahead, everyone – the platforms, the people who use them, and the people who make the rules need to work together to make sure DeFi stays safe and helps build a better financial world for all.

                        The tokenization of real-world assets (RWAs) is fast gaining momentum, with traditional fund managers, including the likes of Blackrock and Franklin Templeton, now issuing tokenized U.S. treasuries. However, amidst this surge of RWAs, one asset class that has yet to get the attention it deserves is real estate. The latest statistics reveal that the global real estate market was valued at $613 trillion in 2022, with projections showing it could eclipse $729 trillion by 2028. However, despite this potential, real estate remains one of the most illiquid asset classes. To provide some context, assets like stocks and bonds are traded on a daily basis, but a piece of property can take more than a decade before it changes hands. Of course, one of the main reasons is that property owners prefer to hold real estate as a long-term asset or because of the sentimental value attached to generational ownership.  But at the same time, we cannot ignore the fact that disposing of real estate can be an uphill task, especially if one is urgently in need of cash (liquidity). Bridging the Access Gap in Traditional Property Ownership
According to a tokenization report by BCG, the opportunity to tokenize illiquid assets such as real estate, art, and select commodities stands at a whopping $16 trillion. This partly explains why traditional financial companies that have been anti-crypto are, for the first time, willing to join the digital asset bandwagon.So, what’s in it for the real estate market? With tokenization, it is now possible for small-time players and underprivileged communities to gain access to the traditional real estate market through fractional ownership. Instead of buying a whole building or a huge piece of land, tokenization allows prospective investors to own a small portion by purchasing a specific number of digital assets that represent part of the underlying property.You might be wondering, how about the nuances associated with real estate property ownership, such as the notarization of the transfer documents or profit allocations in the case of an income-generating property?Although a nascent area of innovation, Blocksquare’s real estate tokenization protocol is a good example of the handful of RWA projects that have managed to integrate a foolproof notarization and registration process in its smart contract infrastructure. The project recently completed tokenizing a parking slot in Slovakia’s Tech Park Ljubljana, executing the first-ever notarization of a tokenized real estate asset that was registered in the Slovenian land registry. While some technical operations were involved, the tokenization process involved Blocksquare creating an ERC-20 smart contract dubbed ‘Prop Token’ to define the maximum number of its native token ‘BSPT’ that would be issued to represent the parking lot. On the other hand, NDP, which is the real estate company that manages the parking lot, drafted a corporate resolution, outlining the obligations and rights associated with the property. This corporate resolution was then made public through the InterPlanetary File System (IPFS) and recorded on the Prop Token smart contract to automate the token issuance process and distribution. The final and most critical step was the notarization which involved a loan agreement to tie down the parking lot as collateral. In this case, Blocksquare acted as the lender, issuing BSPT tokens that were distributed to several investors by NDP real estate management (borrower). More importantly, this transaction was authenticated by a certified notary public hence the recognition in the Slovenian land registry.  Of course, there are many other approaches that real estate RWA projects are using to tackle the liquidity gap and introduce the aspect of enforcement to digital property. Notably, the projects in this realm could benefit from partnering with local authorities that are involved in the property market which happens to be the case in a country like China. This way it would be more seamless to tokenize real estate with the blessings of the regulators. To add to it, specialization in certain types of real estate is also a need in the current market. For instance, assuming a potential real estate investor in the U.S. wanted to acquire high end properties in tourist destinations such as Thailand, it would be a cumbersome endeavor if they decided to go through traditional realtors. However, with decentralized real estate marketplaces such as Sabai RWA, these types of properties are now just clicks away.  What Is the Future of Tokenized Real Estate? 
As mentioned in the introduction, real estate holds immense potential for investors looking to maximize their returns or diversify their portfolio. It doesn’t stop there!Besides the allure of returns to investors, the real estate tokenization market could soon become the go-to ecosystem for loan borrowers in the commercial real estate (CRE) industry. According to a report by Reuters, the CRE market faced one of its biggest liquidity gridlocks last year following the Fed’s aggressive rate hike regime. Even private lenders who are considered ‘last resort’ could only lend to the CRE market at very high rates.What if more real estate were tokenized? This would mean more accessible capital for CRE borrowers at lower rates, while at the same time, even small-time lenders would get a piece of the real estate pie.In summary, the tokenization of real estate doesn’t stop with issuing or distributing tokens; this ecosystem can easily have a trickle-down effect on other asset classes that have long been cash-strapped due to over-reliance on illiquid property.

These Indicators Suggest Selling Pressure From BTC Investors May Be Waning: Bitfinex


																A bitcoin (BTC) price recovery may happen sooner than expected because selling pressure from market participants may be slowing down.
The latest weekly report from the crypto exchange Bitfinex revealed that some on-chain indicators suggest that selling pressure from short-term holders may be waning.
Bitcoin Selling Pressure May Be Waning
Since BTC hit its all-time high in March, the asset’s trajectory has remained bearish, plunging to a new local low of $56,500. One indicator that the bears are currently in charge is the spike in the Exchange Whale Ratio, which reveals that whales have been making large deposits in crypto exchanges, possibly to sell and realize profits.
Once the ratio stabilizes, it is a sign that long-term holders and whales have finished distributing their supply for the time being, preventing any further corrections.
Although whales are major players, short-term holders often trigger significant market responses. The Realized Loss metric shows that this cohort of investors currently dominates selling pressure, which is coming mostly from BTC held for one week to one month. Bitcoin’s spot price usually reacts to changes in the one-week-to-one-month cost basis.




One of the metrics that suggests selling pressure from short-term holders may be waning is the Market Value to Realized Value (MVRV) ratio for one-week to one-month holders. This indicator has dipped to the 0.9 to 1 range often seen during bull market corrections. Bitfinex said there are indications of a local bottom formation.
In addition, the short-term holder MVRV ratio is at 0.96, a level that often precedes a market recovery. This suggests that short-term holders could be nearing exhaustion in their selling.
BTC May Head North Soon
Another metric suggesting a potential BTC price recovery is the Bitcoin Fundamental Index (BFI), which evaluates several aspects of the network’s health, including wallet activity and transaction volume. The index is currently at an inflection point, suggesting that BTC may move northwards soon.
“The current position of the index indicates that selling pressure is waning, while network growth has surpassed levels observed at previously identified market bottoms. This potential for positive movement hinges largely on liquidity expectations, which makes future decisions of the FOMC meeting crucial,” Bitfinex said.

Will Ethereum Ever Surpass Bitcoin? Markus Thielen Weighs In


The crypto community has long debated whether Ethereum (ETH) might one day surpass Bitcoin (BTC) in market capitalization—a scenario often referred to as “the flippening.” However, Markus Thielen, head of research at 10x Research, remains skeptical. 
According to Thielen, Ethereum’s weak fundamentals and recent performance trends strongly suggest that Bitcoin will maintain its dominance.
How Ethereum Has Been Lagging Behind
Often called digital gold, Bitcoin has solidified its role as a hedge against inflation and a key asset in the portfolios of “sovereign individuals” worldwide. This identity was reinforced in 2017 when Bitcoin developers decided to maintain a 1MB block size, emphasizing its status as a store of value rather than a currency. 
This strategic move has made Bitcoin particularly appealing during economic uncertainties.
Conversely, Ethereum’s journey has been fraught with challenges. Despite playing a crucial role in the 2020-2021 bull cycle with innovations like NFTs and the potential for banking system replacements, Ethereum has struggled with significant scaling issues. 
The long-overdue Dencun Upgrade (EIP-4844), intended to reduce high gas fees, only arrived three years after these problems became evident. 


“While the Dencun Upgrade (EIP-4844) solved this in March 2024, it was three years too late. Crypto users (and traders) are not sitting around and waiting until a blockchain solves their bottlenecks; instead, those users move on, and today, most of the action is on Layer 2s,” Thielen said.

Consequently, Ethereum’s dominance in the crypto market has decreased from 17.8% to 15.8% post-upgrade. Moreover, the ETH/BTC trading pair has been in a downtrend since September 2022.

“Forget the flippening of BTC that many predicted,” Thielen boldly remarked.

Reflecting this disparity, Blackrock has shown a strong preference for Bitcoin over Ethereum. The market also mirrors this. For instance, Ethereum ETFs garnered just 15% of the inflows in Hong Kong compared to their Bitcoin counterparts, indicating limited investor interest in Ethereum.

Moreover, the regulatory environment remains a significant barrier for Ethereum. Recent SEC actions against exchanges like Kraken and Coinbase have left Ethereum’s classification as a security unclear. The regulatory uncertainty only deepens as the SEC is expected to deny Ethereum ETFs.
Financial indicators also highlight Ethereum’s struggles. The shift towards what some call “ultrasound money” has not resonated with investors as anticipated. Furthermore, Ethereum’s total value locked (TVL) in protocols is much lower than its peak, predominantly confined to staking and restaking activities.

“The concept of staking Ethereum became flawed as soon as US Treasury yields were available on-chain at much higher yields (5%). At the same time, the Ethereum use cases nosedived. The more people realize this, the less demand there will be for ETH,” Thielen explained.

In addition, Ethereum has lost ground in the stablecoin market, a critical area of crypto transactions. Tron has surpassed Ethereum in USDT issuance thanks to its lower transaction costs, signaling a strategic failure by Ethereum to maintain its market share.
Given these insights, Thielen recommends caution regarding Ethereum.

“Right now, we would be more comfortable holding a short position in ETH than a long one in BTC as Ethereum’s fundamentals are fragile, which is not yet reflected in ETH prices,” Thielen remarked.

                        SHIB has dropped by 6% in the past 24 hours, with the Shiba Inu price moving to $0.00002401 on day when the crypto market has fallen by 1.5%.The meme coin remains up by 2% in a week, but is down by 10% in a fortnight and by 15% in the last 30 days.On the other hand, SHIB holds onto a healthy 150% gain in the past year, with the coin remaining popular among traders, despite its ups and downs.And today’s move follows closely on the heels of large transfer of 875 billion SHIB, with a whale taking this sum off Robinhood on May 2, in a sign that the meme coin could rally big again soon.Shiba Inu Price Prediction as Whale Moves 800 Billion SHIB Within 1 Minute – Big News Coming?
While SHIB has suffered a blow today, its indicators suggest that it isn’t too far from making a comeback.Its relative strength index (purple) had fallen as low as 35 this morning, yet it has since begun rising towards 50, in a sign that SHIB’s discounted price is tempting buyers.Source: TradingViewMeanwhile, SHIB’s 30-day moving average (orange) is just dropping below its 200-day (blue), which usually indicates further losses in the near term.Yet this move also usually indicates that a bottom isn’t too far away, and that the coin will soon rebound.What’s also encouraging in this respect is the fact that SHIB’s resistance (red) and support (green) levels are converging on each other.Normally, such a convergence creates a pinch point that forces a given asset to make a big move in either direction.And given that SHIB has already taken its fair share of punishment over the past few days, you would expect this move to be positive.This appears to be what whales are expecting, with the tweet above showing that one large trader bought close to $20 million in SHIB a couple of days ago.In other words, smart money is betting on SHIB rising in the not-too distant future, and often it’s the case that where whales lead, retail will soon follow.The wider market will be instrumental in helping SHIB make some gains in the coming weeks and months, with the eventual cutting of rates likely to be a big factor in the crypto market’s rejuvenation.More broadly, Shiba Inu boasts possibly the strongest fundamentals of any meme token, with its developers recently raising $12 million for a new privacy-focused layer-three network.As such, the Shiba Inu price could reach $0.00004 by the end of the summer.New Meme Tokens Could Bring Market-Beating Gains
Yet SHIB isn’t the only meme coin in the market with solid fundamentals and real potentially to rally, with a handful of new meme coins also looking very promising.Arguably the best of such new tokens is Dogeverse (DOGEVERSE), a multi-chain cryptocurrency that has raised more than $13 million in its hugely popular presale.The first ever Doge-themed multichain cryptocurrency, the coin will launch on Ethereum and then bridge to Polygon, BNB Chain, Solana, Avalanche and Base.Its existence on multiple chains means that DOGEVERSE will have a considerably bigger addressable market than many of its rivals, with the coin potentially gaining much traction and use than it would have as a simpler single-chain token.Also bullish is its hard cap of 120 million tokens, which could make it deflationary over time, especially if it does attract adoption on multiple apps and trading platforms.Another positive feature is its staking system, which will not only reward holders with a passive income, but will take a big chunk of its total supply out of circulation.VIDEOSuch bullish features have clearly had a big influence on investors, who have flocked to the coin’s presale in recent weeks.New investors can still join by going to the official Dogeverse website, where 1 DOGEVERSE costs $0.00031.This price will rise several times before the sale ends, at which point it could rise even higher on exchanges.Buy DOGEVERSE Today

Boom in the Stock Market for Nvidia shares and crypto mining companies

Yesterday, it was a really good session on the stock market for Nvidia shares and crypto mining companies. 
Actually, in some cases the daily earnings have been really significant, if compared to the average of traditional stock exchanges.

Crypto mining: Marathon’s boom in the stock market and Nvidia’s shares
Probably the most representative stock of the American crypto mining industry is MARA by Marathon Holdings.
Yesterday MARA recorded a sensational +18% daily, although it was mainly a rebound after the losses of the previous days. 
In fact, yesterday’s closing price of 20.6$ is not much higher than the late April peak of 19.8$, and is still significantly lower than the 22$ at the beginning of April. 
The MARA title appears to be very volatile, even more than the price of Bitcoin, despite the company mainly focusing on Bitcoin mining.
The fact is that with the halving of the reward for miners, which occurred on April 20, there were strong doubts about the sustainability of the business of companies that mine Bitcoin.
During 2024, the MARA stock reached an annual peak on February 28th at over $34, but it had already risen above $30 by the end of December 2023. 
Starting from February 29th, it began to decline, despite the peak of Bitcoin occurring on March 14th, precisely due to the doubts about the impact of the halving on its business.
It should be remembered, however, that in October it was just above $7, so since then it has still recorded an incredible +185% in just over seven months. 
Actually in December a mini-bubble inflated that brought the price above $30, and then burst in March with a drop to $14 in mid-April. Since then it simply bounced back above $20.
Other cryptocurrency mining actions
In addition to MARA, you can also analyze the price trend of RIOT stocks. 
Yesterday Riot Platforms’ stocks gained just over 3%, failing to even rise above the $12 from which the descent started at the end of April. 
In other words, while MARA yesterday experienced a real boom in the short term, RIOT’s stocks are showing less volatility. 
The point is that not all crypto mining companies react in the same way to the halving, with some suffering more and others suffering less.
Nevertheless, even RIOT in the last seven months is showing a good +23% increase, although compared to the $18.7 at the end of December 2023, the current price of $10.7 is significantly lower. 
The title RIOT suffered a bit more in March, when it dropped from $18.3 at the end of February to $7.8 in the days just before the halving, but since then it has not dropped to these figures. 
So although the trend may seem similar, there are some significant differences in the performance of various mining companies, depending on how they have reacted to the halving. 
The Nvidia title
Another title that is performing well these days is Nvidia’s.
However, this is a company that operates in a different sector, specifically in the production of chips for artificial intelligence. 
Yesterday it recorded a great +3.7%, but in reality it has been rising since the beginning of May. 
The current value of $921 is not far from the all-time high of $974 in early March, as it has only dropped below $760 in mid-April since then, and then rebounded significantly above $900.
The fact is that in October it was more or less around $400, so in seven months the price of Nvidia shares has more than doubled. 
If we add that in October 2022 it had also dropped below $110, the gain since then has been 670% in just over a year and a half. Not even Bitcoin has managed to achieve such a gain since October 2022. 
The apparent correlation between Nvidia’s actions and crypto mining activities
Although these trends may seem related, they are actually only superficially so due to their dependence on a common underlying dynamic shared by many securities. 
The key point is liquidity, and above all how it moves in the markets. 
After the Fed’s QE of 2020/2021, there is still a lot of liquidity in the markets, but it is not stagnant. 
Although it has decreased slightly from the peak at the end of 2021, there is still a lot of it circulating, and depending on how it moves, it greatly influences the markets and financial assets. 
In particular, for a few months she has been attracted to stocks related to artificial intelligence, such as Nvidia, and those related to crypto markets, such as MARA and RIOT. This is probably also the basis of the crypto bull run that started in October of last year.
So it would be wrong to say that the trend of crypto mining companies going public is correlated with stocks like Nvidia, but they are certainly both similarly influenced by liquidity dynamics, which in turn are influenced by the Fed’s monetary policies and the fiscal and economic policies of the US government.

Shiba Inu (SHIB) Price Breakthrough Failed: What's Next?

Shiba Inu has failed to break through key resistance levels and is now experiencing downward pressure. This movement is characterized by a descending triangle pattern on the charts, indicating potential further declines.The descending triangle, typically viewed as a bearish signal, suggests that sellers are more aggressive than buyers, leading to progressively lower highs. Currently, SHIB is facing resistance along the triangle's upper trend line, while support has been established around $0.0000237. If this support level fails to hold, there is a strong possibility that SHIB could drop toward the next significant support at $0.000021.SHIB/USDT Chart by TradingViewShiba Inu’s market sentiment appears to be tilting toward bearishness. A breach below $0.000021 could lead to a test of the $0.00002 mark. The potential for a breakdown below this level could set the stage for even more of a substantial loss, bringing some troubles for market participants, and for SHIB specifically.On the flip side, if SHIB can gain enough buying pressure to reverse the current downtrend, a return to higher resistance levels such as $0.0000268 could be possible. This would necessitate a significant shift in market dynamics, potentially driven by positive developments within the Shiba Inu ecosystem or broader market sentiment shifts.Monitoring volume right now could be the best way to predict an upcoming move for Shiba Inu. Currently, volume trends have been relatively flat, which typically suggests a lack of conviction in the market's direction. An increase in trading volume, especially on upward movement, would be a positive sign that a stronger rebound might be underway, but only if the market in general is reversing upwards, which is not the case for now, unfortunately.

                        Austrian crypto exchange Bitpanda is expanding its operations to the Middle East and opening a regional office in the United Arab Emirates (UAE).The firm has tapped former 1inch Network’s business development and head of growth Walid Benothman to lead its operations in the region.In an announcement, Bitpanda said it will open its first office in Dubai at the DMCC Crypto Centre and has appointed an experienced team led by Benothman to tailor its offering to the local market.Bitpanda is in the final stages of obtaining its Financial Services Permission (FSP) and said it will continue to work with regulators in the region to make sure it is fully compliant.“The UAE is the ideal place for us to make our entry to the Middle Eastern market. It has the perfect mix of investor demand and innovative regulatory environment that will allow us to deliver the best trading solution available on the market,” said Eric Demuth, co-founder and CEO of Bitpanda, in a press release.The UAE is the fintech unicorn’s first expansion outside of Europe due to the region’s “tech-friendly banking industry” and the country’s crypto-friendly regulatory environment.Bitpanda BTS
The firm said it will be making its trading infrastructure business dubbed “Bitpanda Technology Solutions” (BTS) available in three months once Bitpanda MENA has finalised obtaining its local licence later this year.Earlier this year, Austrian cooperative bank Raiffeisenlandesbank Niederösterreich-Wien (RLB NÖ-Wien) began allowing its clients to trade digital assets via their banking apps using Bitpanda infrastructure.In April, German federal bank Landesbank Baden-Württemberg entered a crypto partnership with Bitpanda to offer crypto-asset custody services in the second half of 2024. Bitpanda said over the next few months it will work with the German bank to provide corporate clients with a regulated platform using its “investing-as-a-service” infrastructure for crypto-asset custody and procurement. Bitpanda was founded in 2014 in Austria by Eric Demuth, Paul Klanschek and Christian Trummer, achieving unicorn status in 2021.

                        Solana’s second biggest canine meme coin, Bonk ($BONK), tumbled 8.5% overnight as meme coins take some of the heaviest losses amidst a market-wide dip.Bonk now trades at $0.00002525. At this price, it’s about 7% more expensive than it was last week. These numbers make for a more volatile reading than those from market leaders Bitcoin ($BTC) and Ethereum ($ETH), but they are more stable than other high-market cap meme coins. The world’s favorite cryptocurrency with a market cap of over a trillion dollars, Bitcoin, dropped 1.4% in the last 24 hours but grew 3.8% over the seven days and now changes hands around $64,275. Its number one contender, the most commercially important blockchain Ethereum dropped 2.4% overnight but appreciated 1.8% over the seven days and trades at $3,124 as of this writing. Solana-based meme coins like BONK fared much better than their Ethereum or proprietary blockchain counterparts over the last week.Solana projects that posted notable seven-day appreciation include DogWifHat ($WIF), which grew 30%. Book of Meme ($BOME) rallied 27% and Popcat ($POPCAT) mushroomed a staggering 45% over the week.These gains far outdo the top performers among non-Solana meme coins. Original meme/canine coin Dogecoin ($DOGE) only added 14.5% over the seven days while Pepe Coin ($PEPE) added 21%.BONK’s trading chart for the last three months begins with the token setting an all-time high (ATH) of $0.00004547 on March 4, although today’s price represents a 44.5% pullback since then. Source: TradingViewBonk spent the rest of March and April in gradual free fall, bottoming out around $0.000015 before turning green again.With a relative strength index (RSI) of 45 and no clear indication of buying or selling momentum, BONK’s price could go either way by the end of the week, depending on the industry-wide or macroeconomic outlook.Is Solana’s $SEAL the Next Viral Meme After Bonk?
Solana meme coins will likely be the target for many investors hoping to help the ecosystem develop into the so-called “Ethereum killer” it’s often touted to be.Sealana ($SEAL) is the latest in a long line of hilarious new Solana coins vying for attention. The hillbilly seal has already raised more than$250,000 in a hilarious new presale that’s barely a week old. Sealana is a spin on the viral South Park character Gamer Guy, aka Fat Computer Nerd. Gamer Guy appeared in the hit cartoon’s side-splitting World of Warcraft episode and instantly became a viral meme all on his own for his milk-bottle glasses, screen-lit look of concentration, messy room and gravity-defying girth. He has symbolized anyone from the legions of disgruntled keyboard warriors writing sharp, acerbic opinions in internet comments sections, to a kind of Everyman – a symbol of the idler in everyone.Beached at his desk and ballooning by the day, Sealana’s roving flippers reach for sustenance of chips and tinned tuna between filthy degen trades. It’s the American Dream rewritten in Web3!For every 1 SOL, investors get 6,900 $SEAL tokens when the presale ends. This gives them some tidy booty to hoard (or HODL) to exploit some potentially explosive appreciation through the presale and beyond.Users can pay using a widget on the website or by sending SOL from a decentralized wallet to this address: DJ15ZYXqUNMYJ3hL7z4ciSaSFAw5cbos3YjGpdvwmF6c.Follow the latest developments on Sealana’s X account.Buy Sealana at the official website here.

Polygon launches ZK-based Ethereum scaling solution Miden on testnet

Polygon (MATIC), the leading Ethereum scaling solution, unveiled on Monday the introduction of its zero-knowledge (zk) based “Miden”, a scaler designed to enhance the capabilities of the Ethereum chain.A zero-knowledge rollup is a Layer 2 scaling solution that moves computation and network state off-chain. A rollup records transaction data directly on the Layer 1 chain, specifically on Ethereum. Put simply, a rollup decreases the computational burden on the Layer 1 chain, resulting in reduced transaction time and cost for users. Polygon’s ZK-rollup Ethereum scaler Miden hits testnetPolygon, a provider of layer-2 solutions for Ethereum, recently released an alpha version testnet of their new zero-knowledge rollup (ZK-rollup) solution named Miden. This comes as competition in the Ethereum scaling space intensifies.Polygon announced on May 6th that the Polygon Miden Alpha Testnet zero-knowledge feature was available for developers to start testing. Miden is a ZK-rollup that aims to enhance the functionalities of the Ethereum blockchain. The announcement was codial with “babe, wake up, it’s here: the Polygon Miden Alpha Testnet is live—a zk self-sovereign focused chain ready for pioneers who want to cook.”The protocol stipulated that the scaler will alleviate the strain on the Ethereum blockchain, enhancing privacy and scalability for users while expanding the chain’s capabilities. As the competition to expand Ethereum becomes more intense, developers can now start testing the zk-rollup.The several Layer 2 chains, namely Base, Optimism, Arbitrum, zkSync, Scroll, and Linea, aim to enhance the scalability of Ethereum. Rollups provide data verification while maintaining data confidentiality from the rest of the network. They prioritize user privacy and enable the development of proofs for client-side transactions locally. These steps aid in alleviating the strain on the underlying Ethereum blockchain.Keom Research, a project focused on developing zero-knowledge solutions for decentralized finance (DeFi), is currently conducting tests on Polygon’s Miden platform, as mentioned in a recent tweet on X.Miden explained – What did you miss out onThe scaler offers client-side proving, allowing users to construct proofs for their own state transitions without revealing the state to the network, as detailed by Polygon. The objective is to reduce the load on the network and enhance privacy and scalability.By design, the scaler also provides supplementary capabilities, such as private accounts that allow for private tokens and transactions, with only the hash of the account being maintained on the blockchain.Miden usees parallel transaction execution, allowing for concurrent processing of transactions. This enables it to achieve significantly greater throughput compared to the Ethereum mainnet and mitigate the issue of blockchain node state bloat.Additional expected notable features comprise of adaptable smart contracts and personalized node scripts, enabling users to compose their own scripts using the Miden virtual machine (VM) and programming languages like Rust.As per the Miden roadmap, a test network for builders is planned for September. The mainnet launch period is not specified.Miden has recently joined the market as a direct competitor to StarkWare’s layer-2 scaling network and rollup technology, StarkNet, as well as other options like Matter Labs’ zkSync Era.Polygon also develops zkEVM, a scaling solution that is functionally comparable to the Ethereum Virtual Machine. This allows for seamless compatibility with the majority of existing smart contracts, tools, and wallets.How is all this done?In order to handle all of these tasks, Miden nodes are equipped with distinct modules.The Tx prover is responsible for executing and providing evidence of transactions, similar to the Miden client.The Tx aggregator is a tool that combines multiple proofs together in order to decrease the size of the final state proof. This is achieved through the use of recursive proving.The block producer is responsible for providing the user with the RPC interface and managing transactions in the tx pool. It also maintains the state of Polygon Miden by storing information in three databases: accounts, notes, and nullifiers.

QCP Capital secures preliminary approval to operate in Abu Dhabi - Crypto Briefing




QCP Capital, a top Singapore-based crypto options trading desk for digital assets, has received in-principle approval from the Financial Services Regulatory Authority of Abu Dhabi Global Market (ADGM) to conduct regulated activities. This development marks the firm’s expansion into the Middle East.The crypto options trading desk, which processed nearly $60 billion in crypto derivatives trading volume last year, is the first Singapore-based digital-asset market maker and broker dealer to receive preliminary approval from ADGM, according to a spokesperson from the regulator. Once it secures a full license, the company plans to relocate some of its more than 70 employees to Abu Dhabi.The United Arab Emirates has been actively working to attract more crypto companies, with Binance, OKX, and Nomura’s Laser Digital already establishing operations in the region. Melvin Deng, CEO of QCP, praised Abu Dhabi’s regulators for their progressive approach to the digital assets ecosystem, considering it as a part of traditional finance.“Abu Dhabi has got very progressive regulators in that they are thinking about the digital assets as a complete ecosystem with all of traditional finance,” said Deng.Deng, who joined QCP in 2021 after spending over 15 years at Standard Chartered Bank, also cited the geographical location as a factor in the firm’s decision to expand to the Middle East. He noted that the region serves as a confluence for capital flows from Europe, the Middle East, and Asia, similar to Singapore’s position.According to an Ernst & Young report, the monthly volume of crypto derivatives stood at $1.33 trillion as of September 2023, with most of the activity taking place outside the United States.QCP recently announced a partnership with Abu Dhabi-based Further Ventures to develop new products in digital assets. Once the firm receives the full license, it will prioritize core businesses such as trading and market making in the region.

First Mover Americas: Bitcoin Settles Into $63K-$64K Range

Bitcoin fluctuated between $63,000-$64,000 during the Asian and European mornings on Tuesday, consolidating its recovery from last week's crash below $57,000. Despite retreating from Monday's high of around $65,500, BTC appears to have settled into a range comfortably above the $60,000 level. At the time of writing, it was priced at $64,114, largely unchanged from its price 24 hours before, but nonetheless up around 10% since the start of May following a slide of over 16% in April. The broader digital asset market has dropped 1.33% since yesterday, as measured by the CoinDesk 20 Index (CD20).

----------------

Why Is The Bitcoin Price Falling Today?


                            Bitcoin (BTC) has experienced a price slowdown, having recently recovered above $60,000. This tepid price movement is believed to be due to a couple of factors, including the reduced demand for the Spot Bitcoin ETFs. 
Spot Bitcoin ETFs Have Lost Their Spark
The Spot Bitcoin ETFs recorded billions of dollars in net inflows in the first three months of launch. This contributed to the significant rally that Bitcoin recorded right around when the funds were approved, with the flagship crypto rising to a new all-time high (ATH) in March. However, demand for these funds has declined since the start of this month. 

Research firm Kaiko also noted in its recent report that net inflows across all ETFs have steadily dropped for a while now. This has ultimately affected Bitcoin’s bullish momentum, with the flagship crypto trading sideways. Bitcoin’s price performance in the last 24 hours suggests that the recovery above $60,000 wasn’t necessarily a bullish reversal.
Andrey Stoychev, Head of Prime Brokerage at Nexo, had previously warned that Bitcoin was unlikely to experience any significant price surge without a catalyst. He added that the crypto token would likely continue to trade around the $67,000 price range. That means one can expect Bitcoin to keep bouncing off the support and resistance in the meantime. 
The silver lining is that the demand in the Spot Bitcoin ETFs could pick up soon enough, with these funds likely to provide a much-needed boost to Bitcoin’s price when that happens. A trend reversal for these ETFs looks imminent, especially after Grayscale’s GBTC recorded its first day of net inflows on May 3. 
Another Reason Why Bitcoin’s Price Is Down
Crypto analyst Mikybull Crypto also recently predicted that Bitcoin could drop below to clear the CME (Chicago Mercantile Exchange) gap at around $62,580. This price gap exists because the CME’s Bitcoin futures market doesn’t run on weekends. The crypto analyst added that things could pick up once Bitcoin clears the CME gap. 

The analyst also suggested that the worst may be behind, irrespective of whether Bitcoin continues to trade sideways, as he stated that the crypto token’s local bottom is in. However, Mikybull Crypto also predicts that Bitcoin will need to clear out the $67,000 price level and consolidate before it can move towards $73,000. 
In anticipation of this price surge, now looks to be an excellent time to accumulate the flagship crypto as crypto analyst Ali Martinez mentioned that Bitcoin’s Market Value to Realized Value (MVRV) 90-day ratio indicates that it is still in a “prime buy zone.”
At the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading at around $63,400, down over 1% in the last 24 hours, according to data from CoinMarketCap.

Poll: Most U.S. Voters Cringe About Crypto, But Enough Care to Warrant Politicians' Attention

About 14% of people in the online survey of registered voters own crypto right now, they said, and many more have a high awareness of the emerging financial technology. But fewer than one in three voters surveyed – 31% – said they have positive views on digital assets, according to the snapshot of responses from people in Michigan, Ohio, Montana, Pennsylvania and Arizona.

Silent Protocol unveils Ghost Layer, a modular Layer 1.5 for Ethereum


Silent Protocol, a leader in blockchain privacy technology, has announced its Ghost Layer, an innovative modular Layer 1.5 tailored for Ethereum (ETH), according to the information shared with Finbold on May 7. 
The new release aims to deliver compliant privacy enhancements to public blockchains, catering to individual and institutional clients alike.
The launch also underscores Silent Protocol’s dedication to constructing a compliant and composable framework, allowing institutions to securely and privately leverage Ethereum. 


Ghost Layer 0VM technology
By opening access channels to various execution layers, Ghost Layer allows for easy integration of existing applications into private workflows.
It leverages a zero-knowledge (ZK) based system in conjunction with its proprietary 0VM technology, which enables private asset storage and facilitates value transfers across different blockchains.
Novachrono, the founder of Silent Protocol, elaborated on the Ghost Layer’s role within the blockchain landscape, stating: 

“If you create a ledger whose state is decided by the base ledger but the computation is stored elsewhere — you can call it a Layer 1.5.” 

The strategic importance of Ghost Layer
Isa Sertkaya, Co-founder and CTO of Silent Protocol, highlights the strategic significance of the Ghost Layer:

“Rooted out of Ethereum and supporting Ethereum assets, the Ghost Layer achieves modularity not by capturing value vertically but by enabling horizontal composability across different chains.”

By implementing 0VM technology, the Ghost Layer advances system state while verifying updates and utilizing the base ledger for state validation through zksnarks.
Developers on various blockchains now also have the opportunity to transform their existing applications into privacy-preserving ones, known as 0dapps, while retaining the liquidity available on the mainnet.
Economical Zero Knowledge Execution Environment
In 2023, Silent Protocol introduced the Economical Zero Knowledge Execution Environment (EZEE), introducing a fully composable architecture supporting functional privacy. 
This framework empowers developers to create apps without the constraints of isolated systems. 
Additionally, Silent Protocol developed the Silent Compliance VM, a decentralized protocol that selectively reveals data to prevent misuse by malicious actors.

Ripple CTO Unveils Crucial Timeline for Stablecoin Reveal


David Schwartz, Chief Technology Officer of Ripple, has provided clarity on the timeline for the launch of the company's stablecoin. Addressing recent speculation, Schwartz clarified that the stablecoin's launch is not scheduled for June, contrary to some interpretations. Instead, he indicated that updates, including the announcement of the stablecoin's name, are expected to be shared in June.This clarification follows Ripple's recent announcement of its entry into the stablecoin market, aiming to enhance the stability and accessibility of the XRP Ledger. The company intends to achieve this by backing the new stablecoin with a combination of U.S. dollar reserves and similar assets, positioning itself as a competitor to established stablecoin creators, such as Tether and Circle. By engaging with regulatory authorities and emphasizing compliance, the company aims to establish its stablecoin as a trusted digital asset, potentially mirroring the functionality of a digital dollar. Notably, Ripple's established rapport with the SEC, despite its tense legal battles, lends further credibility to the new venture.What's with XRP?The previous clarification provided by Schwartz also addressed questions regarding the role of XRP in Ripple's view on payment solutions. He emphasized that the popular cryptocurrency remains integral to the company's vision, highlighting its suitability for specific transactional contexts. Schwartz underscored Ripple's dedication to optimizing its services by leveraging XRP's strengths while acknowledging its limitations.With Schwartz's announcement, the XRP community anticipates further updates from Ripple in June, eagerly awaiting the progression of this significant initiative and how it will affect the trajectory of their favorite cryptocurrency.

Joseph Lubin Defends Ethereum Against SEC Overreach | Cryptoglobe


                                
In a recent interview with Wired, Joseph Lubin, co-founder of Ethereum and CEO of Consensys, shed light on his ongoing legal battle with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). 



Consensys is a leading blockchain software technology company with a core focus on the Ethereum ecosystem. They develop a comprehensive suite of tools, products, and infrastructure designed to empower developers, businesses, and individuals harnessing the potential of Ethereum. Consider ConsenSys a pivotal player in constructing the foundation for the decentralized web.



The conflict, which centers around the SEC’s alleged attempts to classify Ethereum’s native cryptocurrency, ETH, as a security, has far-reaching implications for the future of the decentralized web.



Last month, Consensys received a Wells Notice from the SEC, indicating that the regulator is considering suing the company over its MetaMask wallet. The SEC takes issue with two specific features of MetaMask: token swapping and staking. However, Lubin believes that the SEC’s actions go beyond MetaMask and represent a broader effort to assert control over Ethereum and the decentralized technologies built upon it.



In response to the SEC’s notice, Consensys filed a lawsuit against the regulator, accusing it of an “unlawful seizure of authority over ETH.” The company argues that ETH does not possess the characteristics of a security and that the SEC’s actions could have disastrous consequences for the Ethereum network.







            
            

            
            

            
            

        

Lubin explains that if the SEC were to successfully classify ETH as a security, it would have a “chilling effect” on Ethereum users in the United States. Individuals would be unable to legally acquire ETH, and software developers would be hindered in their ability to further develop the Ethereum protocol or build applications on top of it. Moreover, Lubin fears that the U.S. could use its influence to pressure other countries to reduce access to decentralized protocols and financial disintermediation.



By bringing the lawsuit against the SEC, Consensys aims to clarify the limits of the regulator’s jurisdiction and encourage the broader crypto industry to push back against what Lubin describes as “aggressive and unlawful SEC overreach.” He argues that the SEC has been “gaslighting the industry” by secretly treating ETH as a security while publicly stating otherwise.



Lubin likens the current situation to the early days of the internet, when new technologies caused confusion and required open dialogue and clear regulation. He believes that, ultimately, the situation will be resolved favorably for Ethereum, but acknowledges that the industry is currently in a “painful stage” marked by resistance from regulators.



A favorable outcome for Consensys would be a clear declaration that ETH is a commodity, not a security, and the eventual approval of ETH spot exchange-traded funds (ETFs) by the SEC. Lubin believes that such a development would open “floodgates” of capital into the Ethereum ecosystem, driving further growth and maturation of decentralized finance (DeFi) applications.



Lubin dismisses the notion that the SEC’s interest in Ethereum intensified following The Merge, a major upgrade to the network’s consensus mechanism. He argues that the post-Merge Ethereum network is more decentralized and secure, and that staking rewards should be seen as income, not investment contracts.



When asked about the SEC’s motivations, Lubin offers a “conspiracy theory,” suggesting that the U.S. government and big banks are resistant to the disintermediation and direct financial agency that decentralized technologies offer. He believes that the SEC’s actions are less about expanding its jurisdiction and more about slowing down or killing new technologies that threaten the status quo.

This Solana trader lost $37,000 in 17 minutes with FOMO and a panic sell


A cryptocurrency trader speculating in the Solana (SOL) ecosystem lost $37,000 worth of SOL trading a meme coin. As things developed, the trader bought under the ‘fear of missing out’ (FOMO) and panic sold for the realized loss.
In particular, the Solana trader purchased 398 SOL worth of the cryptocurrency DEVIN during a price surge. The chart formed a local high at these levels and started dropping a few minutes later, as reported by Lookonchain.
17 minutes later, the Solana trader panicked and sold the recently acquired DEVIN’s stack for 158.8 SOL. Therefore, the address 8TALRxv9p5FdM5Mssvs8MTdZ9vh7DCj496YGoazYmJnu effectively lost 239 SOL, valued at around $37,000 by the time of reporting.

Solana trader: Panic sell and FOMO behaviors
This trading behavior is known as a panic sell or capitulation. A sell-off decision under losses during an aggressive price crash. Essentially, investors do that in an attempt to lower forecasted losses if they believe the price will continue crashing.
In this case, further price action justified the Solana trader’s action, as the panic selling occurred in the first 5 minutes of a 50-minute crash. However, this happened just before a major retracement that eventually surpassed the SOL-cost average of the FOMO purchases.
On that note, a ‘fear of missing out’ behavior happens when the trader enters a position after a meaningful positive performance. Nevertheless, doing that made this address enter the local top, providing net negative results.
If this Solana trader had waited for a correction before making the purchases—without FOMO—the results would have been better. Additionaly, if the trader had waited for the volatility to play out and did not panic sell, the address would currently hold a profitable stack of DEVIN.
In this context, Lookonchain urged investors to “don’t FOMO” and “be patient.”

Interestingly, the reported event illustrates two common behaviors among investors, which makes most traders lose money in the long term. Cryptocurrencies are highly volatile assets, and speculators should put emotion aside when making financial decisions.

Whale That Bought Bitcoin in 2014 Moves $43,940,000 in BTC After Sitting Dormant for Over Decade: On-Chain Data - The Daily Hodl


								A crypto whale is being noticed for suddenly moving tens of millions of dollars in Bitcoin (BTC) from a long-dormant wallet.
According to blockchain tracking firm Lookonchain, the deep-pocketed crypto investor completely emptied their wallet that had contained 687.33 Bitcoin for more than a decade.










“A wallet that has been dormant for 10.3 years transferred all 687.33 BTC ($43.94 million) out [on May 6th]. The whale received 687.33 BTC ($630,000 at that time) on January 12th, 2014, when the price was $917. Address: 15WZNLACuvcDrrBL2btDErJggnaMQtHh5G.”
Source: Lookonchain/X
Meanwhile, CryptoQuant CEO Ki Young Ju said last month that newer crypto whales are accumulating nearly twice as much BTC as their long-term holder counterparts. Ju also said that old BTC tokens were being transferred to new holders after Bitcoin’s average dormancy rate recently hit a 13-year peak.
Bitcoin is trading for $63,835 at time of writing, down slightly in the last 24 hours.
Next up, Lookonchain notices another whale is sitting on huge profits after buying a massive amount of Ethereum (ETH) last year. According to the on-chain monitoring platform, the investor has started to unload some of their holdings.
“A whale who bought ETH a year ago seems to be selling ETH to take profits. He withdrew 12,906 ETH ($24.39 million) from Binance at $1,890 a year ago and deposited it into Lido. He withdrew 7,000 ETH from Lido when the market dropped on April 30th and deposited it into Binance [on May 6th]. His profit on ETH exceeds $16 million!” 
Ethereum is trading for $3,083 at time of writing, down 1.6% in the last 24 hours.

Ronin Network Gets Boost from DeFi Lending, Aims to Revive Web3 Gaming | Cryptopolitan

The Ronin network has a small but complete ecosystem containing all the common elements of decentralized finance. Originally designed for Axie Infinity, Ronin’s use has expanded to include DeFi projects and other games. In May, Ronin expanded the DeFi sector, especially due to inflows into the MetaLend project. For a month, the project grew its total value locked (TVL) by 30%, while Ronin as a whole also recovered some of its value in the past two quarters. April marked a watershed for the Ronin network, with new active wallets returning for all use cases. In addition to DeFi, Ronin grows with the addition of third-party games, expanding the portfolio from the selection of Axie Infinity games. Adding new projects is helping Ronin recover after the 2022 hack, where the Ronin bridge lost around $600M worth of tokens.Ronin Expands Beyond Games SpecializationIn its initial stage, the Ronin network was a tool for the assets of the Axie Infinity game. Ronin was created to achieve cheaper transactions and trading for Axie NFT and the AXS and SLP token transfers. The Katana DEX was also launched to serve the game community. Now, Ronin has a native wallet and many more functions to connect to the wider Web3 space. Ronin users can add Coinbase pay, expanding the potential audience to another 90M users, based on Coinbase’s statistics. Ronin itself boosts daily active users with gaming challenge events, tournaments, or by using a play-to-airdrop model for otherwise free games. All activities combined result in significant daily active wallets growth. 
https://coinmarketcap.com/exchanges/katana/?type=spotAdditionally, Ronin offers an app-based integration to the Katana exchange, which now offers easier access to a wider selection of small-scale and riskier tokens. The Katana exchange has a turnover of around $4.2B in 24 hours, though liquidity is limited to the small selection of top tokens. RON Token Close to $1B ValuationThe RON token is now trying to recover its $1B valuation and possibly return as one of the successful unicorns in crypto space. RON has been successful in 2024, becoming one of the rare tokens to peak during the latest bull market. RON reached its all-time high in March, trading at $4.40. About two months later, RON is still holding onto some of the gains, trading at $2.80 for a total valuation of $913M. RON also has limited daily volumes of around $13M, but even activity at $100M is enough to cause a significant rally. The current market conditions see RON as potentially bullish if interest in Web3 and gaming returns. The RON token also benefitted from a new trading pair. At the end of April, RON was listed on the HTX exchange, in a new pairing with USDT. Axie Infinity Gamers Drive Attention to RoninRonin has the advantage of gaining attention when users return to Axie Infinity, one of the most high-profile games during the 2021 play-to-earn boom. The game is now showing signs of heightened interest, with more than 38K daily active players and more than $1B in value turnover. Users on Ronin are also reviving the NFT trade related to the Axie games, lifting turnover and interest in Axie metaverse land plots. Axie Infinity recently marked the highest player activity in the past 12 months, while also reaching 60K transactions per day on the Ronin blockchain.Additionally, the Wild Forest game aims to boost activity, by organizing play-to-airdrop events. Joining the game also requires usage of the Ronin network.In addition to gaming, Ronin is also working on a blockchain-based ID, one of the hot use cases for Web3 in 2024. Ronin offers a .ron naming service, creating specialized addresses similar to the Ethereum Domain Name Service.RON Tokens Locked for StakingRON is also growing in scarcity due to staking around 20% of the total supply. Staked tokens already exceed 209M, while only 1B RON will ever be created. Around 145K Ronin wallets have delegated their tokens. The circulating free supply of RON is only around 322M tokens, and usage for fees, gaming, and trading is growing.

Price prediction of Bitcoin: possible scenarios after the halving

On April 20th, the fourth halving in Bitcoin’s history went live, leading to the halving of the block reward from 6.25 BTC to 3.125 BTC.
Usually, the halving creates conditions for an increase in the price of the currency on the market, or at least that’s what has happened in recent years.
What are the post-halving price predictions for Bitcoin in this cycle?
SPOILER: there is someone who hypothesizes 150,000 USD
All the details below.

Bitcoin price prediction after the recent halving: is the road clear up to $150,000?
Last week Bitcoin hit a new local low at 56,500 USD, breaking a ranging graphic structure that started at the beginning of March 2024, and then quickly recovered the points lost in early May, returning above the price of 64,000 USD.
The canonical quadrennial event of new issuances reduction of the network, known in jargon as “halving”, did not immediately bring the desired effects from the community, especially considering the difficult outlook of the crypto which is in the midst of important geopolitical conflicts and macroeconomic tensions.
The result, unexpected by most forecasts, was a retracement of 21.7% since the beginning of April. This bearish movement is now the heaviest of this cycle, surpassing the correction of September 2023.

Indeed, the dip in recent days has been emphasized by the increase in the Labor Cost Index in the United States and the announcement by the Federal Reserve to continue fighting inflation without starting a quantitative easing policy which would involve a cut in interest rates on government bonds (possibly postponed to September)
Throughout all of this, we also witnessed the launch of the Hong Kong Bitcoin spot ETFs, with data that initially disappointed expectations due to low volumes recorded, later contradicted by metrics on the first day of trading inflows that indicated incoming flows (seed capital) of $292 million.

Pushed by these dynamics, Bitcoin has encountered difficulties in finding a price balance, while miners are preparing to face a season with halved earnings due to the protocol’s halving.
Despite all this, however, it seems that crypto is preparing the ground for a comeback in a big way, which would send it straight to record new all-time highs.
On the macro front, the cooling of the labor market gives hope that the FED may provide the necessary fuel for risk-on markets to face the second half of 2024.
From a more technical analysis and on-chain data perspective, we can see how the open interest, funding rate, and liquidation data have undergone a reset after the excessive speculation seen in the first quarter of the year, suggesting a possible restart in the near future.
The halving effect, which reduces the supply of new coins by 50%, will have its effects in the coming months and potentially cause a supply shock if we also have an increase in demand pressure for spot ETFs in the USA and Hong Kong.
In such a scenario, analyst Bernstein has released his forecast for the Bitcoin bull market, explicitly stating that the crypto will reach $150,000 as the cycle peak in the next year.

On-chain data from Bitfinex: reduction of implied volatility
According to the analysis of the cryptocurrency exchange Bitfinex, following the halving, the implied volatility of Bitcoin has substantially decreased, finding a new acceleration in price fluctuations only in the last few days.
In a context of graphic uncertainty weighed down by complex macroeconomic issues, while traders were trying to establish a price balance for Bitcoin and other assets, the volatility index has dropped sharply suggesting the beginning of a phase of stagnation before the restart.
This is what was reported by Bitfinex analysts, who observed how these dynamics reflect a less worrying expectation from market participants.
“The halving of Bitcoin has not only changed the supply mechanism of Bitcoin, but has also played a crucial role in recalibrating the dynamics of the cryptocurrency market and investors’ expectations”
It is clear that after the halving on April 20, it acted as an event of uncertainty resolution, significantly influencing the volatility and market dynamics of cryptocurrencies.
In particular, the volatility index has dropped by 24.3%, going from 74.54 points to 56.47 points in just a few days. This change indicates the expected market sentiment regarding future price fluctuations, but it has not been reflected by substantial price movements, suggesting a stabilization effect.

Similarly, the implied volatility of Ethereum (EVIV) has also decreased by 15.9 percent in the same period, dropping from 61.94 points to 52.08 points, even though its price has been more influenced by an upward trend with forecasts indicating the possibility of greater growth in ETH compared to BTC.
These declines suggest a lower degree of connection between price levels and volatility, and a greater reduction in market uncertainty.
In summary, Bitcoin’s halving not only reduced the potential supply pressure by decreasing the block reward, but also played a crucial role in recalibrating market dynamics and resetting investor expectations.
Now the market is healthy to start again and aim for the long-awaited $100,000 break.

Neither the author, Tim Fries, nor this website, The Tokenist, provide financial advice. Please consult our website policy prior to making financial decisions.



GlobalFoundries Inc. (NASDAQ: GFS) has recently disclosed its financial results for the first quarter of 2024, showcasing a performance that met and exceeded expectations. With revenue reaching $1.549 billion, the company has demonstrated resilience and adaptability in a challenging market. The gross margin stood at 25.4%, with a non-IFRS gross margin slightly higher at 26.1%, reflecting the company’s efficient cost management and operational effectiveness. Furthermore, GlobalFoundries reported a net income of $134 million, alongside a robust non-IFRS EBITDA of $577 million, solidifying its financial health and stability.



The company’s operating margin was reported at 9.5%, with a non-IFRS operating margin of 12.1%, indicating a strong operational performance despite the competitive and dynamic nature of the semiconductor industry. The cash reserves, including cash equivalents and marketable securities, were reported at $4.2 billion, providing GlobalFoundries with a significant buffer to navigate future uncertainties. Dr. Thomas Caulfield, president and CEO of GF, highlighted the positive financial outcomes as a result of the company’s strategic initiatives and the dedication of its global teams.



GlobalFoundries Beats EPS and Revenue Expectations in Q1



Comparing GlobalFoundries’ current performance against the expectations, it’s evident that the company has surpassed the anticipated metrics for the quarter. Analysts had forecast earnings per share (EPS) of $0.23 and revenue of $1.52 billion for the quarter. GlobalFoundries exceeded the revenue expectation with $1.549 billion and demonstrated a strong profit margin and net income, reporting an EPS of $0.31 for the quarter. This overachievement is particularly noteworthy given the semiconductor industry’s recent challenges, including inventory corrections and supply chain constraints.



The company’s financial results reflect a significant positive deviation from the expected performance, showcasing GlobalFoundries’ robust operational efficiency and strategic planning. Although showing a decline year-over-year and sequentially from the previous quarter, the gross margin and operating margin still represent a strong performance in the context of the broader industry challenges. 





GlobalFoundries  Optimistic for Upcoming Quarters



GlobalFoundries has provided optimistic guidance for the upcoming quarters, signaling confidence in its growth trajectory and operational strategy. The company’s recent business highlights, including significant awards from the U.S. Department of Commerce and New York State for expanding its manufacturing capabilities, are expected to bolster its position in key markets such as automotive, aerospace, and defense. Furthermore, GlobalFoundries’ commitment to sustainability, with goals to achieve net-zero greenhouse gas emissions and 100% carbon-neutral power by 2050, aligns with broader industry and societal trends towards environmental responsibility.

Crypto Trading Patterns: A Guide to Charting and Analysis

What Are Crypto Trading Patterns?
The crypto trading patterns include trends and formations appearing in price charts. The traders decide the right time for selling and buying digital assets by analyzing those patterns.  Chart patterns help investors to forecast future market trends. They decided to buy, sell, or hold the digital assets based on chart pattern analysis.

technical analysis, the traders analyze the price trend during a certain period. Technical analysis and fundamental analysis are very famous crypto trading patterns applied by traders.

Expand your understanding of technical analysis in cryptocurrency.

The other patterns include reversal and continuation. Some traders prefer another strategy called bilateral patterns. 
The price chart of the cryptocurrency shows two symbols of a trading pair of price tickets. Suppose a crypto trader purchases Bitcoin (BTC) against the United States dollar using the currency pair BTCUSD. So, the first currency, BTC, will serve as the base, and the second currency, USD, will serve as quote currency.  The horizontal price line depicts the most recent trading price of the digital currency. 
The trading task among the two currency pairs causes price fluctuation, creating line charts called Japanese candlesticks. The expert analysts analyze and foresee the possible chart patterns from the movement of lines and candlesticks. The price charts, trade volume, and price changes are basics of technical analysis. 
Why are Crypto Chart Patterns so Important?

There are more bit chances of upward price movement and continuing the previous increase as the handle appears.  

Wedges
If there is a rising wedges movement, it will show bearish market sentiments of two trend lines converging upward and having a sharper upper line than a lower one. Although there are similarities in lines, they differ from ascending triangles to line slope directions. 
If there is a falling wedges movement, it shows a downward slope converging trend and indicates a bullish market trend. If both lines of this pattern slope in the same direction, the lower bar steeps slowly, indicating a bullish market trend. 

Head and Shoulder Pattern
The head and shoulder pattern is very popular in the crypto space. It shows a negative trend and hints at a fall in prices. There are three major indications, “head” indicates a higher main peak, and two lower elevations are called “shoulders”. However, the peak heights, particularly in the shoulders, are precise. 

Ascending and Descending Triangle
The rising trend line and horizontal resistance line mutually create an ascending triangle, resulting in a bullish market trend. If the price resists, it shows buying pressure and a possible breakout. The descending triangle shows a price-falling trend and bearish market sentiments. If the price falls below the support level, check it carefully; it indicates a possible price decline.

Double and Triple Top Pattern
If the cryptocurrency price falls compared to the last peak, the double-top pattern forecasts bearish market sentiments. At the same time, the triple-top method has three peaks preceding the support breach, signaling the downward movement and resulting in the weakening of the bullish market trend. 

Double Bottom
In the double-bottom pattern, the price of an asset creates a W-shaped move. It shows that after two low price movements, there is the possibility of a price increase. It indicates a long-term or intermediate reversal in the overall market trends.

Binance CEO says Nigeria is detaining US exec as a control tactic, reveals bribe demands

Binance CEO Richard Teng has called for the release of Tigran Gambaryan, the exchange’s detained executive in Nigeria.In an extensive May 7 blog post, Teng said Gambaryan’s detention was unjust and set a dangerous precedent. He said:“To invite a company’s mid-level employees for collaborative policy meetings, only to detain them, has set a dangerous new precedent for all companies worldwide.”Gambaryan is a US citizen who heads the crypto exchange’s financial crime compliance department. He and Nadeem Anjarwalla, Binance’s regional manager for Africa, were apprehended upon their arrival in Nigeria’s capital, Abuja, on Feb. 26. Anjarwalla escaped custody on March 22.Teng pointed out that Gambaryan “did not go to Nigeria as a ‘decision-maker,’ nor a ‘negotiator.’ He was merely acting as a functional expert in financial crime and capacity building in policy discussions.”He accused Nigeria of detaining the Binance employee as a part of efforts to exert control over the exchange.According to Teng:“The message from the Nigerian government is clear: we must detain an innocent, mid-level employee and a former US federal agent, and place him in a dangerous prison in order to control Binance.”He concluded that Nigeria should “let Tigran go home to his family, and then Binance will work through the same process that we have done with Nigeria’s law enforcement community voluntarily more than 600 times in the past.”Binance makes bribe allegations against NigeriaIn his blog post, Teng revealed that the exchange received requests from “unknown persons,” purporting to be representatives of Nigeria’s House Committee on Financial Crimes (HCFC), demanding a “significant payment in crypto to be paid in secret.”Teng refrained from revealing further details regarding the amount requested.The New York Times reported that an individual associated with the Nigerian government approached Gambaryan and asked for a bribe amounting to approximately $150 million in crypto.However, Teng said the exchange declined the “payment demand” because it did not “view it to be a legitimate settlement offer.”Mentioned in this article

Hong Kong Forms Working Group to Support Tokenization, CBDC Interoperability



The Archite­cture Community aims to enhance interoperability between wCBDC and tokenized assets, where wCBDC acts as a digital bridge to facilitate smooth interbank settlements for tokenized assets.

Hong Kong is taking a bold step towards a digital asse­t-driven future. The Hong Kong Mone­tary Authority (HKMA), the region’s central bank, announce­d the formation of the “Project Ense­mble Architecture Community” on Tue­sday. This industry-wide working group represe­nts a significant advancement in deve­loping standards for Hong Kong’s tokenization marke­t, focusing on the integration of wholesale­ central bank digital currency (wCBDC).
The community unite­s key players from the financial sector, including the HKMA, the Securitie­s and Futures Commission (SFC), the BIS Innovation Hub Hong Kong Centre­, the CBDC Expert Group, and seve­n major private sector entitie­s: Bank of China (Hong Kong), Hang Seng Bank, HSBC, Standard Chartered Hong Kong, HashKe­y Group, Ant Digital Technologies, and Microsoft Hong Kong.




Interoperability with wCBDC for Tokenized Assets
The “Archite­cture Community” aims to enhance inte­roperability betwee­n wCBDC, tokenized money, and toke­nized assets. This focus on seamle­ss interaction holds significant potential, where­ wCBDC acts as a digital bridge to facilitate smooth interbank se­ttlements for tokenize­d assets.
“It will make recommendations on specific topics, initially focusing on setting up a mechanism to support seamless interbank settlement of tokenised deposit through wCBDC for tokenised asset transactions,” stated the HKMA in an official press release.
This collaborative approach shows Hong Kong’s commitment to deve­loping a robust and efficient digital asset e­cosystem. By e­stablishing clear standards and facilitating interoperability, the­ community aims to create a more stre­amlined and secure e­nvironment for both traditional and innovative financial instruments.
Industry Leaders Drive CBDC Innovation
The formation of the “Architecture Community” arrives amidst ongoing efforts by the HKMA to explore the potential of CBDCs. The authority has been actively testing its digital currency, with the second phase of the e-HKD pilot kicking off in March 2024. This pilot is anticipated to run until mid-2025, providing valuable insights into the real-world functionality and adoption of the e-HKD.
Hong Kong’s intere­st in CBDCs starte­d in 2017 with preliminary research. Howe­ver, a major push towards studying the e-HKD, cove­ring both wholesale and retail applications, happe­ned in 2021. The “Architecture­ Community” highlights Hong Kong’s ongoing dedication to innovation and exploration in the digital asse­t space.
By bringing top leaders togethe­r, Hong Kong puts itself at the front of making future-proof financial infrastructure. The focus on working well toge­ther and the ongoing e-HKD trial show gre­at promise for Hong Kong’s goals in the digital asset fie­ld.

EMURGO Inks Partnership with GSR to Promote Cardano Ecosystem



EMURGO has been a core supporter of the Cardano blockchain since 2021.

Cardano-based developer EMURGO has inked a strategic partnership with renowned trading platform GSR. This partnership is aimed at promoting the Cardano (ADA) ecosystem.
In a press release, the prominent blockchain technology firm that facilitates the commercial adoption of Cardano explained the modalities of this new alliance with GSR.




EMURGO to Leverage GSR’s Services and Expertise
The focus of the collaboration between EMURGO and GSR is to improve multiple sections of the Cardano growth trajectory. It will focus on improving provision of liquidity, identifying promising venture investments, fostering better user interoperability, and jointly promoting educational initiatives.
To achieve these goals, the collaboration will seek to onboard more developers, companies, users, as well as other stakeholders.
EMURGO’s new partner holds a license for the Digital Payment Token Service. This license was granted by the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS). This made it the first digital asset market maker to receive such accreditation. With such a license, GSR positions itself as a reputable player in the crypto ecosystem.
Apart from GSR’s suite of services, it brings onboard its expertise and consolidated experiences as one of the major market makers in the cryptocurrency space. Similarly, EMURGO will play the pivotal role of serving as a channel between GSR and the Cardano ecosystem.
According to Ken Kodama, CEO of EMURGO, “EMURGO is excited to work with GSR and utilize its established track record as one of the largest market makers in the crypto space to support the growing Cardano ecosystem.”
“GSR’s wealth of experience, expertise, and deep resources will enable Cardano builders and projects to develop and scale their Web3 products to potential Web3 users while fostering an even more robust Cardano ecosystem moving forward,” Kodama added.
EMURGO Proves Undying Support for Cardano
Noteworthy, EMURGO has been a core supporter of the Cardano blockchain since 2021. The firm continually offers support to regional startups through seed financing and incubation. Ultimately, the aim is to promote adoption of the Cardano blockchain in Africa as solutions for social impact.
After announcing its intention to launch the first stablecoin on the Cardano protocol in 2022, EMURGO debuted the fully backed, regulatory-compliant stablecoin dubbed USDA in May 2023. Avenues for easy adoption of the launched token were integrated into the design of the USDA stablecoin.
Usually, such collaboration news generally impact on the price of any associated asset. ADA is currently trading at $0.4519 with a 2.88% decrease within the last 24 hours. This level is a far cry from the Year to Date (YTD) price peak of $0.77. This level was attained at the beginning of March this year. This suggests that EMURGO’s collaboration with GSR has not has stirred any positive impact on ADA price yet.
With the recent statement from MicroStrategy’s founder Michael Saylor about how ADA is security alongside Ethereum and other altcoins, EMURGO may need to do more to amplify the capabilities of Cardano in and out of the blockchain ecosystem.

Key Shiba Inu (SHIB) Indicator Explodes by Almost 400%: Details


																TL;DR

Shiba Inu has experienced significant increases in large transaction volumes and daily active addresses, despite a recent 6% drop in value.
Positive developments in SHIB’s ecosystem, including a surge in the token burn rate and enhancements to its Shibarium layer-2 blockchain, suggest potential for a future price rally.


SHIB’s Resurgence
While the price of Shiba Inu (SHIB) is down 6% on a 24-hour scale, some important metrics related to its ecosystem have headed north. 
IntoTheBlock data shows that aggregated daily volume, where each transaction is larger than $100,000, has surpassed the $60 million mark. This figure represents a whopping 382% increase compared to the day before. The number of daily active addresses is also on the rise, albeit in a more modest fashion. 
The spike of such significant transactions can impact the SHIB price. For instance, large buy orders can reduce liquidity by taking a substantial amount of tokens off the market, potentially driving the value up due to decreased supply. On the other hand, sell orders can trigger the opposite scenario as more assets will become available.




Whale transactions may also influence investor sentiment, fueling additional enthusiasm among traders and thus propelling the flow of fresh capital.
Other Contributing Factors for a SHIB Rally
The burn rate and the advancement of the layer-2 blockchain solution – Shibarium – are additional elements that may cause a SHIB bull run. As CryptoPotato reported, the burn rate exploded by over 4,000% on May 6, resulting in more than 81 million tokens destroyed. 
The mechanism’s ultimate goal is to reduce the tremendous supply of the meme coin, making it scarcer and possibly more valuable in the future.
Shibarium has been making great strides, too, by undergoing two major upgrades. The first occurred in mid-April when the team launched a new user interface (UI) update, describing it as “faster, smoother, and more accessible than ever.” It aimed to enhance compatibility with popular self-custody wallets, including MetaMask, Coinbase Wallet, and Trust Wallet. 
Shortly after, the developers introduced another development via a “hard fork.” Its goal is to improve user experience, empower the community of developers and innovators, and implement quicker block processing times.
“We are also smoothing out transaction fee variations during high traffic times, making costs more predictable and fair for everyone. This ensures our platform remains affordable and accessible,” the team added.

Play Social Games, Earn Crypto Rewards: Solana Gaming App 'Cupcake' Launches - Decrypt

B+J Studios launched its new social rewards program for its online gaming app Cupcake on the Solana blockchain on Tuesday, billing the web-based experience as a fun and engaging potentially entry point into the world of cryptocurrency.Using a feed format similar to TikTok, Cupcake features mini-games inspired by crypto culture and memes and includes games like Would You Rather, Caption This, and Two Truths and a Lie to earn rewards. B+J Studios is billing Cupcake as a "CultureFi" (or "culture finance") app, following in the footsteps of such trends as GameFi and SocialFi.“Cupcake’s approachable social games create a new way to celebrate, understand, and onboard to the pace of innovation in crypto,” Cupcake CEO Chris Liquin told Decrypt. “Our rolling feed of ephemeral games lets users see and experience the trending cultural moment of the week, have an active role in the trend, and earn prizes and rewards for high engagement.”In the play-to-earn game, B+J Studios said, Cupcake players collect “Proof of Cake” rewards—unique, cupcake-themed collectibles, with each coming in different tiers—and rewards including cash, tokens, merch, experiences, digital status, and access to special events.Image: CupcakeAccording to Liquin, the Cupcake web app will be playable on Cupcake.com when it goes live today and will be available to a global audience. It's targeted towards players who are scrolling on their smartphones, given the TikTok-like design.While Liquin noted that the crypto builders are developing rich endemic culture that spans art, technology, music, memes, and fashion, the experience may feel gated behind “the chaos of Crypto Twitter, Discord, and Telegram.”“Unless you’re glued to your keyboard on Crypto Twitter, you face an insurmountable learning curve,” Liquin said.Cupcake is designed to be an easier entry point to the crypto space—with Solana-based rewards, to boot. Joining B+J Studios in the Cupcake launch and providing content and rewards are The Nifty, Cube, the Moutai meme coin, SolCasino, and BONK.Image: Cupcake“Most people in the world don’t gamble—but they do share funny memes on social media, play social games with their friends, and enjoy a little friendly competition,” Liquin said. “Unlocking the value of crypto culture with familiar social experiences and using tokens as a new primitive to incentivize engagement and active attention is the CultureFi opportunity.”Thanks to its low cost and speed, Solana has become an increasingly popular blockchain for launching video games, including space MMO Star Atlas, race-to-earn MixMob, and monster battle game Aurory. One such game with Solana-based assets, hero shooter Nyan Heroes, is reviving its pre-alpha demo servers starting Wednesday, May 8 for the second round of gameplay with play-to-airdrop rewards.Edited by Andrew HaywardStay on top of crypto news, get daily updates in your inbox.

Bitcoin mining revenue hits yearly low: Is BTC’s security at risk?


Bitcoin’s (BTC) mining revenue plunges to new lows following the halving event, raising concerns about the network’s security and profitability for miners. 
Daily revenue from Bitcoin mining has dramatically fallen to under $3 million from an average of roughly $6 million in early 2024, marking a significant decline. This downturn follows the Bitcoin halving on April 20, 2024, which reduced the block reward from 6.25 BTC to 3.125 BTC, effectively halving the miners’ income from block rewards.
Despite a brief surge in transaction fees due to the introduction of a new token standard called Runes, which spiked the daily transaction fees to an all-time high of $78.3 million on April 20, the hype was short-lived.


Bitcoin hash price index. Source: HashRate Index
Hashprice—a measure that miners use to determine the earnings potential of their operations—rose to $182/PH/Day the day after the halving, but Runes activity and transaction fees have since diminished, and the Hashprice hit an all-time low of $49/PH/Day on May 07, 2024, according to Luxor‘s index.
Challenges for sustaining profitability
The reduction in mining rewards has prompted miners to rethink their strategies to remain profitable. Many have resorted to upgrading their equipment to more energy-efficient models to cut operational costs. However, the lower profitability might lead some miners to exit the industry, which could have significant implications for Bitcoin’s network security.
Industry leaders are voicing their concerns in light of the recent decline in mining revenue. Ki Young Ju, CEO of CryptoQuant, said that miners are presented with two choices: either exit the market (capitulate) or hold out for a potential rise in Bitcoin’s price to offset their operational costs.

Yet, the continuous decline in revenue per terahash signals a potentially challenging future for miners if Bitcoin’s price does not appreciate significantly.
Bitcoin mining companies amid revenue’s yearly low
Amid these challenges, large mining companies like CleanSpark Inc (NASDAQ: CLSK),  Riot Platforms Inc (NASDAQ: RIOT) , and Core Scientific have been proactive in optimizing their operations to buffer against revenue fluctuations.

First, Cleanspark has managed to maintain healthy profit margins by acquiring more efficient mining equipment and expanding its facilities, despite industry challenges. Riot Blockchain has stayed competitive by continuously investing in the latest mining technology and making operational adjustments.
Meanwhile, Core Scientific, despite its financial challenges and a recent Chapter 11 bankruptcy, is restructuring to lower operational costs and improve mining efficiency for long-term sustainability.

Impact on network security and future outlook
The primary concern stemming from reduced mining profitability is the potential decrease in the hash rate—the total computational power used to mine and process transactions on Bitcoin’s blockchain.
A lower hashrate signifies fewer miners securing the network, which can increase vulnerability to attacks, such as the 51% attack, where an attacker could potentially control the majority of the hash rate and influence transaction verification.
Despite the drop in mining revenue, the overall hashrate has not shown a proportional decline, largely due to technological advancements and efficiency improvements in mining hardware. 
However, the profitability squeeze could lead to smaller or less efficient miners exiting the market, which might concentrate hashing power among larger mining operations. This centralization could pose additional security risks by making the network more susceptible to coordinated attacks or failures.
Historically, Bitcoin’s price has tended to increase following halving events, potentially offsetting the reduced block rewards. However, the unique circumstances of each halving mean outcomes can vary. The current halving occurs amidst a backdrop of high inflation and economic uncertainty, factors that could influence Bitcoin’s price differently compared to previous events.
Investors and participants in the Bitcoin ecosystem will need to monitor how these dynamics evolve. The network’s resilience in maintaining security and miner profitability will be crucial for its long-term viability and trustworthiness.

Ethena Breaks Consolidation: Is $1 the Next Stop for ENA?


Ethena (ENA) is gaining notable attention, stirring discussions among traders and analysts with its potential price trajectory aimed at flipping the $1 mark. 
The cryptocurrency maintains relevance without the hype surrounding AI or meme tokens, which are currently the key trending sectors at the moment. Based on recent sentiment and market trends, ENA shows signs of a bullish breakout.
Ethena Mentions on Social Platforms on the Rise
Over the past month, key influential accounts within the crypto community have steadily mentioned ENA, indicating rising interest. Analysis reveals that 32 significant X users discussed ENA in the last 30 days, with a reinvigorated focus from 12 of them in just the past week.

Remarkably, three unique key opinion leaders (KOLs) have again highlighted ENA in the last 12 hours, adding to the short-term bullish sentiment.
Despite this uptick in mentions and social buzz, long-term sentiment stability remains uncertain. Only 20% of the monthly mentions have occurred in the last week, suggesting that while the immediate outlook may be positive, sustained momentum could require further growth in engagement and discussion.

Ethena Bagholders Await Favorable Selling Conditions as Price Stalls 
As Ethena (ENA) inches towards the significant $1 price point, recent market dynamics hint at a potential upward trajectory. Currently trading at approximately $0.90, the token has seen notable activity in its trading volume and investor sentiment.

The most recent data indicates a strong holding pattern among investors, with a substantial 67.45% of ENA holders “Out of the Money,” meaning their holding price is higher than the current market price. This will likely cause a slow-down in selling at current levels and force the majority of holders to continue holding until their positions flip In the Money.”

Moreover, ENA’s network metrics reveal a healthy and growing ecosystem despite a slowing market. Despite fluctuations, the total number of ENA holders has maintained relatively steady growth. currently sitting above 36,000 holders for the past month. 
The network’s growth, illustrated by the number of new addresses being created daily, continues to decline as the price has followed a similar pattern. However, it is worth noting holders are still holding firm, as previously illustrated.

ENA Price Prediction: Push Above $1 Next
Technical analysis of the ENA price chart shows a consolidation phase with the price stabilizing above key Fibonacci support levels. The Relative Strength Index (RSI), currently at 55, points to a balanced market condition, neither overbought nor oversold. 
This stability, combined with sustained holder growth, presents a case for potential price appreciation after an extended consolidation period. Currently, ENA sits in the middle of the 0.737 and 0.5 fib levels – representing a strong consolidation area for ENA. 
A push toward $1 is likely, and should it flip this psychological resistance area, the price will likely test $1.12 next.

Given these factors, the $1 price level is not just a psychological barrier but a feasible short-term target. As the market conditions align with increased user engagement and solid technical support levels, ENA could see its value appreciate to or beyond this threshold soon.

Additionally, if market sentiment remains bearish, momentum could shift in favor of the bears, pushing the price back to the key fib support level at $0.735. Which would invalidate the bullish price target.

Hong Kong, which wants to be a leader in the Cryptocurrency Industry, has introduced yet another innovation! - Bitcoin Sistemi

Hong Kong has taken an important step towards the development of the tokenization market and the use of central bank digital currency (CBDC) by creating a special working group.
Hong Kong Forms Industry Community to Advance Wholesale CBDC and Tokenization
The Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA), the territory's de facto central bank, today announced the establishment of “Project Ensemble Architecture Community”.


This initiative aims to promote interoperability between CBDC, tokenized money and tokenized assets, and ultimately set standards for the emerging industry.
In a statement, the HKMA outlined the key objectives of the working group, which include recommending mechanisms to facilitate seamless interbank settlement of tokenized deposits via wholesale CBDC for tokenized asset transactions.





The group also aims to support the design and implementation of Project Ensemble, a new wholesale CBDC project launched by the HKMA in March.

The organizations participating in the “Architectural Community” comprise a range of stakeholders, including the HKMA, the Securities and Futures Commission, the BIS Innovation Center Hong Kong Centre, the CBDC Expert Group and seven private sector members.


Notable participants from the private sector include Bank of China (Hong Kong), Hang Seng Bank, HSBC, Standard Chartered Hong Kong, HashKey Group, Ant Digital Technologies and Microsoft Hong Kong.
The HKMA's initiative comes as efforts to test CBDC continue, with the second phase of the e-HKD pilot launched in March and expected to run until mid-2025.

New Memecoin Solana Doggy (SOLDOGGY) to Rally Over 6,000%, as Shiba Inu and Dogecoin Lag



                    

Solana Doggy (SOLDOGGY) could become a viral memecoin, like Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE).



Solana Doggy (SOLDOGGY), a Solana memecoin that was launched today, is aiming to challenge other memecoin giants, such as Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE).




Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Solana Doggy presents a similar opportunity.



Solana Doggy has a market cap around $13,000 at the moment, meaning that when it just reaches a modest market cap of $200,000-$500,000, early investors would generate returns of 2,000%-5,000% in a matter of days or hours.



The exciting memecoin is poised to rally 6,000% in the coming two days, and Solana Doggy could potentially reach a multi-million dollar market cap within a few weeks.




Currently, Solana Doggy can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jupiter and Raydium, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days.



To buy Solana Doggy on these platforms, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask, or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Solana Doggy by entering its contract address – 3f3XRScU3PnaXvsZ4ZGjxDa15SmbhWeMLxHmSyNngaAE – in the receiving field.



In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price.



If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner.




The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE), and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum.



This is why many SHIB, DOGE, and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like SOLDOGGY.

Bullish Momentum Looms: Bitcoin's Price Eyeing Upsurge on Inverse Head-and-Shoulders Confirmation



                    

Bitcoin’s price might witness a bullish reversal, igniting what one crypto trader calls the “next leg up,” should the inverse head-and-shoulders pattern, a well-regarded trading indicator, come into play.



Matthew Hyland, a crypto trader, shared his insights on May 4, suggesting that if Bitcoin doesn’t break through $67.5k directly, a scenario unfolding over the next month aligns with a potential bottom pattern reversal. 




The inverse head-and-shoulders pattern, which he referenced, indicates a shift from a downtrend to a bullish phase, signaling increased buyer dominance.



“It would be a great setup to propel the next leg up,” Hyland asserted.



While maintaining Bitcoin’s bullish trend is contingent upon it staying above its short-term holder price of $59,500, noted pseudonymous crypto analyst Willy Woo emphasized to his 1.1 million followers on May 3.




The setup of this pattern emerges as Bitcoin’s price forms three troughs beneath a neckline resistance, with the middle trough (the head) deeper than the left and right shoulders.



Following a slight rebound from the “head” at $58,614 on May 1, if the pattern unfolds as per Hyland’s model, Bitcoin could find support around its second shoulder at $60,000, a critical level.



This projected decline would represent a 5% drop from its current price of $63,350, potentially leading to liquidation of $530 million in long positions, as per CoinGlass data.

According to Hyland’s analysis, Bitcoin could surpass its current all-time high of $73,800 by June, aligning with increasing buyer interest in the crypto market, as evidenced by the Fear and Greed Index, which has recovered to a “Greed” score of 69 from a recent low of 43, indicating “Fear.”



Some traders anticipate Bitcoin’s price to remain stagnant in the short term, but they don’t perceive this as necessarily bearish.



“The longer the Bitcoin consolidation takes, the higher its price will meet the trendline,” noted pseudonymous crypto trader Titan of Crypto.



Echoing a similar sentiment, pseudonymous trader Daan Crypto Traders shared with his followers on X on May 4 that Bitcoin’s previous cycle all-time highs tend to decelerate price momentum, leading to temporary stalls.

Analysts Bullish on Polkadot, DOT Price Predicted to Hit $15 in the Near Term ⋆ ZyCrypto

&nbsp

&nbsp
Polkadot’s native cryptocurrency, DOT, has emerged as a standout performer in the digital asset market, with analysts predicting a significant price surge.



Polkadot (DOT) faces downward pressure below the critical $8 resistance level against the US Dollar, signaling a bearish trend. Failure to hold above $6.00 could lead to further downside. After encountering strong selling interest near $7.60, the DOT price initiated a downside correction, echoing similar movements in Ethereum and Bitcoin.



The decline extended below the $6.20 support zone, resulting in a low near $6.03. The price is currently consolidating losses and showing signs of a minor recovery. It is now trading above $7.1 and the 23.6% Fibonacci retracement level of the recent decline from $7.58 to $6.03.



Over the past week, Polkadot’s DOT has experienced a notable surge in price, climbing by 10% in a relatively short period. This increase has caught the attention of analysts and market observers, who see this as a sign of bullish momentum building up in the DOT market. 



The price surge has been attributed to several factors, including positive market sentiment, growing interest in Polkadot’s ecosystem, and overall market trends favoring altcoins.

&nbsp



Analysts Bullish on Polkadot Price Trajectory



Analysts have pointed out the potential for further gains in DOT’s price, with some predicting a spike to $10 in the near term. 



One analyst, Ted on X, believes that DOT is retesting a major support zone and could reach $10 if it surpasses the $7 mark.







Other analysts, such as CRYPTOWZRD and Jesse Olson, share this optimistic outlook. They see potential for DOT to exceed $9.60 and $15.80, respectively, in the coming months.



Analysts have compared DOT’s current price action to its performance six months ago. In November, DOT was trading at less than $5 before surging to almost $12 in mid-March.



Jesse Olson, in particular, has highlighted the similarities in price behavior, suggesting that the current conditions offer a similar buying opportunity as seen six months ago.



Several other analysts have also expressed bullish sentiments toward Polkadot and its native token, DOT. Ash Crypto, a popular analyst with a large following, has stated that he still holds his DOT stash and expects a rally toward a two-year high of $15.



Similarly, Michael van de Poppe has noted Polkadot’s “fundamental progress” and added DOT to his portfolio, anticipating a rotation towards the asset.



Polkadot Developer Activity Slows



Data sourced by ZyCrypto late last month revealed a decrease in developer activity on the Polkadot blockchain. Polkadot had 827 developers contributing to over 5,000 weekly code commits the week prior.



While Polkadot’s developer activity is not considered low, it falls behind other blockchains like Ethereum and BNB Chain. Ethereum, for instance, had over 2,000 weekly developers with more than 19,000 commits, while BNB Chain recorded over 6,000 weekly commits.

LayerZero Labs Shuts Out Employees from Upcoming Airdrop


							

LayerZero Labs bans employees from participating in the project’s token airdrop.



Community watchdog scrutinizes over 500 transactions for insider airdrop claims.



LayerZero addresses Sybil’s attacks with a self-reporting initiative ending next week.




LayerZero Labs CEO Bryan Pellegrino has confirmed that all company employees will be strictly prohibited from participating in the upcoming airdrop of the project’s tokens. Per the disclosure, this policy has been internally communicated and will be enforced with severe consequences, including potential termination.



Pellegrino announced the airdrop policy in a recent post on X while responding to community concerns. In particular, he responded to observations made by user Liubomyr, who has been monitoring the wallets associated with the LayerZero team and moderators. With over 500 transactions under scrutiny, Liubomyr intends to uncover whether these insiders are receiving the airdrop.







Notably, LayerZero is an interoperability protocol designed to empower developers by enabling the creation of cross-chain applications complete with adaptable security parameters. LayerZero Labs is the primary driving force behind the development of this protocol.



The latest development from LayerZero follows the project’s earlier initiative to address Sybil attacks. Early this month, LayerZero offered users gaming the system a chance to self-report in exchange for a 15% reduced allocation of the airdrop. 









Notably, the offer window ends on the 17th of this month. Those who did not come forward risked being excluded from the airdrop entirely.  The initial snapshot for the airdrop was taken on May 1, setting the stage for the upcoming distribution.



Meanwhile, LayerZero Labs has remained tight-lipped about the details of the anticipated airdrop. Regardless, previous hints point towards a potential token release in early 2024. 



Ultimately, LayerZero Labs’ approach reflects a growing trend in the crypto industry to prioritize equitable distribution and transparency in token allocations. Last year, Coin Edition reported that as much as 60% of the TIA airdrop tokens distributed by the Celestia team were claimed by Sybil addresses and airdrop hunters.

Best Polkadot (DOT) Wallets in 2024: Full Comparison


																Polkadot (DOT) is one of the largest and oldest decentralized networks in the crypto industry, popular for its sharded multichain architecture and parachains.
The protocol’s sharded architecture divides the network into multiple parallel chains (aka the shards) to enhance scalability and throughput. This enables Polkadot to process numerous transactions concurrently — thereby avoiding the congestion often seen in traditional sequential transaction processing.
DOT serves as Polkadot’s native cryptocurrency. It fulfills several main functions within the ecosystem:

Utility: DOT is used to pay for transaction fees and reward validators and nominators for their work, among other important functions.
Governance: DOT holders can participate in the network’s governance, influencing decision-making processes such as protocol upgrades and parameter adjustments.
Staking: DOT can be staked to secure and operate the network. Staking involves participants locking up their tokens as collateral to validate transactions and secure the network. To learn more about the process, check out our comprehensive guide on Polkadot staking. 
Parachain Creation: DOT is used to bond (lock up) tokens to allow parachains to be linked to Polkadot through an auction process on the Relay Chain.

Given that DOT has multiple roles within the Polkadot ecosystem, it’s crucial to choose the best Polkadot wallet according to your needs, whether you need to store, stake, or bond.
Regardless, we highly recommend that you review our guide on crypto security. It includes 9 comprehensive tips that anyone who wants to take up self-custody should be aware of. 

Quick Navigation

Types of Polkadot Wallets
Like most blockchain ecosystems, Polkadot has two main types of wallets: hot and cold wallets. The first refers to software applications connected to the internet, allowing users to manage their funds and access decentralized applications, among other features, across different devices.
Cold wallets refer to physical, hardware wallets similar to pen drives that provide better security because they store cryptocurrencies offline, i.e., off the internet. However, they require a higher degree of self-responsibility. They’re also less dynamic and flexible than hot wallets.
Let’s dive into the specifics below and see the other types of Polkadot wallets you can use.
Web Wallets
Web wallets refer to extensions that can be downloaded and installed into a browser, such as Chrome, Firefox, Opera, and others. They can be thought of as a mini-application within your browser for managing your crypto.
Web wallets are convenient due to their flexibility and accessibility, allowing you to manage, store, send, and receive crypto through a web browser. Moreover, several web wallets provide access to dApps and Web3 applications and support non-fungible tokens (NFTs), expanding their functionality beyond moving assets.
This level of accessibility makes them a user-friendly solution for everyday transactions and digital assets management.
Desktop Wallets
Desktop wallets can be downloaded and installed directly on your computer. They are usually more capable than browser extensions, adding extra features like integrated staking, broader cryptocurrency offerings, and reinforced security mechanisms for safeguarding your assets.
Similar to web wallets, desktop wallets are usually self-custodial, meaning you’re responsible for your funds, and they are not stored or managed by a third party. However, you might need a certain level of technical knowledge to install them.
Mobile Wallets
If you’re wondering if there’s any Polkadot wallet for iPhone, the answer is yes. Of course, there are DOT wallets both for iOS and Android.
The benefits might be obvious — accessibility and convenience, given that you can manage, store, send, and receive crypto on the go. However, be mindful of security risks due to potential malware on your phone (and the possibility of losing your phone).
Hardware Wallets
As mentioned earlier, hardware wallets are physical devices designed to securely store cryptocurrency private keys.
Hardware wallets generate and store private keys directly on the device, isolating them from the internet. This greatly reduces the risk of hackers accessing keys through malware or online attacks.
Hardware wallets provide the highest levels of security for the crypto funds you could ever ask for.
In conclusion, each type of wallet has its fair share of pros and cons. It all depends on your needs and what you wish to do with your crypto funds.

What it allows you is to completely wipe off your device, put it into airplane mode forever, and use it as a cold storage. You will have to install an app, downloaded from either the App Store or from Google Play, but the overall setup process is relatively simple.
You can find additional information here.
How to Choose the Best Polkadot Wallet?
Choosing the best Polkadot wallet is largely dependant on your own preferences, level of technical understanding, as well as goals. You should determine what’s the purpose that you want your wallet of choice to serve.
However, there are a few fundamental characteristics that you should probably consider. These include:
Custody
Do you want to be in complete control of your DOT or are you comfortable sacrificing security for convenience? This will determine whether you should store your DOT on a centralized exchange or on a self-custody wallet. The latter is always recommended.
Purpose
If you are looking for a solution to simply store your DOT without any further Web3 interactions, getting a hardware wallet and keeping it in a safe location is undoubtedly the best option. In general, hardware wallets provide more security, but they do come with slight inconveniences when it comes to frequent interactions with Web3 applications.
User Interface
There are multiple wallet providers out there, and choosing one based on reviews alone can be a bit overwhelming. Take some time to simply test the applications and choose the one that feels easiest to use.
Security
It’s always recommended to use a wallet provider with a proven track record and, preferably, no incident history.
Customer Support
Chances are that you will have something to ask at some point, and it’s always convenient to have reliable and knowledgeable customer service available.
Frequently Asked Questions
Which Polkadot wallet is best for airdrop?
Airdrops can be an exciting way to earn money out of thin air, but they also come with a lot of risks. There are a lot of bad actors who are using scam airdrop campaigns to exploit their victims. Therefore, it’s always recommended to use a hot wallet like Nova Wallet for Polkadot airdrops, but make sure that it is isolated and not connected to your main accounts.
Is Polkadot on Metamask?
Polkadot is not supported by wallets like MetaMask, which have extended support predominantly for the Ethereum network. This is because Polkadot is a standalone layer-one blockchain and you need to use compatible wallets to store your DOT.
What is the minimum for Polkadot wallet?
There is no minimum amount of DOT required to use a Polkadot-compatible wallet. You can send as little as 0.001 DOT if you want. Just make sure to always have some spare DOT for gas fees.
Is Polkadot on Trust Wallet?
Yes, Polkadot is supported by Trust Wallet. In fact, Trust Wallet is one of the best Polkadot solutions for integrations with hardware wallets like Ledger, for example.

Friend Tech Enjoys Activity Resurgence After V2 Rollout - The Defiant

The price of FRIEND is up 200% from its May 3 low.Friend Tech is enjoying an increase in activity and adoption following its controversial airdrop last week.Data from Dune Analytics shows that more than 79,500 users have created 137,157 clubs since the feature debuted alongside Friend Techl’s v2 iteration on May 3. Club keys have already driven 18.4 million FRIEND in volume ($37.9 million) from nearly 103,500 traders.For comparison, 1,175 traders drove just $155,000 worth of key trades on April 28. Key volume also surged to its highest level in six months following the airdrop, with Friend Tech hosting $4.98 million worth of key trades on May 6, down from $11.6 million on May 3.“Over 100,000 clubs have been created since Friday,” Friend Tech tweeted. “At this rate, there will be more clubs than there exist pigeons on Earth by the end of the year.”However, sell orders have accounted for more than 97% of trade volume since the airdrop, suggesting many users are offloading their keys after receiving a token allocation.Friend Tech’s long-awaited airdrop elicited pushback from the project’s community, with many users encountering errors that prevented them from claiming while the price steadily crashed on launch day.However, the token’s price has tripled from its low, last changing hands for $2.67 after dropping to $0.89 on May 3, according to CoinGecko. FRIEND currently ranks as the 262nd largest cryptocurrency by market cap at $247 million.Friend Tech ignited a web3 socialfi boom when it launched in August 2023, with the volume of daily key trading peaking above $20 million during the following month. Daily active users also tagged all-time high in October at 74,000, with roughly 833,000 unique users having interacted with the protocol as November began.However, Friend Tech’s explosive growth quickly slowed, with 911,450 wallets having interacted with the protocol today.

Ethereum Spot ETF Approval Delayed: SEC Postpones Verdict on Invesco's Proposal | Bitcoinist.com


								Pessimism surrounding Spot Ethereum ETFs approval is set to increase as the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has opted to delay its decision on the approval process of Invesco Galaxy’s ETH Spot ETF, fueling uncertainty in the crypto market.
SEC Pushes Back Invesco’s Ethereum Spot ETF
In October last year, Invesco Galaxy filed a proposed rule change to list and trade shares of its Ethereum spot ETF, Commodity-Based Trust Shares, with the SEC under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 19b-4 thereunder, which was published in the Federal Register in November.

Invesco Galaxy’s Ethereum Spot ETF aims to reflect the performance of the spot price of Ether, by retaining ETH units with a different custodian. The document indicated that Invesco is the sponsor and Galaxy Digital is the execution agent, which is responsible for selling ETH to cover the Trust’s costs. However, according to a Monday filing, the Commission has decided to postpone its decision on the company’s proposal. 
The SEC declared that additional time is needed to analyze the related concerns and the proposed rule change, stressing the need for more time to fully assess the spot ETF proposal. Thus, the regulatory watchdog has given an additional 60 days to approve or disapprove the proposal.
The filing read:
The Commission finds that it is appropriate to designate a longer period within which to issue an order approving or disapproving the proposed rule change so that it has sufficient time to consider the proposed rule change and the issues raised therein.
Given that the SEC has 240 days overall from the publishing date to make extensions before reaching a final decision to approve or disapprove the application, the agency is expected to issue a final decision on Invesco Galaxy’s Ethereum Spot ETF by July 5, 2024.
Invesco Galaxy is the latest asset management company to see its Spot ETF proposal being delayed by the agency. Other notable companies like Blackrock have also encountered the same fate over time.
Blackrock’s proposed Spot Ethereum ETF was delayed in March, marking the second time the Commission has postponed the firm’s proposal. This repeated delay from the SEC thus far has cast a dark shadow on the exchange products within the crypto community.
ETH Spot ETFs See Pessimism From Top Crypto Figures
Over time, Ethereum Spot ETFs have seen constant negative sentiment from top figures in the crypto space, unlike Bitcoin, which saw unwavering optimism from these figures. Last Month, Tron Founder Justin Sun expressed his disbelief in the products getting approved by the May 31 deadline. “My honest opinion (NFA) is that an Ethereum ETF won’t be approved in May,” he stated. 

Sun claims the crypto industry still needs to prepare for a drawn-out education process in order to help authorities and regulators understand cryptocurrency, even though he believes the industry has already reached this stage.
Currently, the likelihood of acceptance of the ETH Spot ETFs now stands at a mere 12%, which is a significant decline from the 76% odds recorded in January following the approval of Bitcoin spot ETFs.

Opportunity? Bitcoin reconfirms $150,000 target


With Bitcoin (BTC) back above the critical price level at $60,000, several finance experts have offered their views on the next target for the flagship decentralized finance (DeFi) asset, which sees it hitting $150,000 in the long run, as recently reiterated by the $800 billion bank Standard Chartered. 
As it happens, cryptocurrency investor and host Scott Melker, commodities specialist Mike McGlone, CoinRoutes chairman Dave Weisberger, and managing partner at the Bitcoin Opportunity Fund James Lavish, sat for an episode of Melker’s ‘The Wolf of All Streets’ streamed on May 6.
Discussing the potential Bitcoin target at $150,000, Melker argued that the maiden crypto asset could, indeed, hit this price, adding that the macro thought would suggest that $150,000 might be a really high target, but the “rational thought says ‘screw this, it could go higher.’”


Bearish Bitcoin price prediction
On the other hand, according to Bloomberg’s senior commodities expert McGlone:

“Everything is starting to tilt lower, Bitcoin’s potential leader, and it’s started. (…) Bitcoin has been underperforming the S&P500 NASDAQ for a couple of years now if you just look at the ratio basis and that’s a bit of a problem. (…) I want to see it really do well versus beta, but now that we’re past this perfect storm for higher prices, that’s over.”

In his view, for Bitcoin to get to $150,000, the S&P500 “needs another 30%,” but “we have to admit one thing – that’s very rare for S&P500 to sustain 20% above its 100-week moving average (MA),” although he acknowledged that the largest crypto had the “long-term definable diminishing supply, increasing demand and adoption.”
Bullish Bitcoin price prediction
At the same time, Weisberger believes that Bitcoin could go even higher than the set price, arguing that the bigger picture was more important when analyzing the asset’s future price movements, explaining that he was “almost eye-wateringly, unbelievably more bullish about Bitcoin now than ever before.”

“If we’re going to get a cycle high this time, where will it be? My answer is somewhere over $200,000 because that would literally be average based upon what it’s done in the past. (…) You have to go back at least to 2015 if you want to start drawing charts because you have to take into account these cycles.”

Finally, as he concluded, “Bitcoin is cheap, cheap, cheap compared to its fundamentals,” while also sharing his opinion that it is basically “on sale, I think it’s at a discount and that how I look at it long-term,” stressing the irony of Bitcoin not being very attractive to investors when its price is stalling.
Meanwhile, Lavish pointed out that Bitcoin going in the opposite direction would still be a good thing, as it would allow the late-comers to grow their coffers with the largest asset in the crypto market, as it would only continue to grow its price in the future:

“If Bitcoin collapses down to the $30,000 – $40,000, that’s a tremendous opportunity (…) to grab some deep value on a long-term asset that will hold its value and will continue to appreciate in long periods of time, so just give it a few years, and that’s it.

BTC price analysis
For now, Bitcoin price today stands at $63,620, recording a slight decline of 0.62% on its daily chart but, nonetheless, advancing 3.99% across the previous week as it attempts to reverse the previous losses of the accumulated 8.37% in the past month, as per data on May 7.

As a reminder, Bitcoin’s recent rally past the $60,000 price level marked a significant recovery from its drop below the $57,000 zone ahead of the recent Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting, signaling the possible end of the post-halving ‘danger zone.’
That said, things in this market can sometimes change suddenly, so making any specific Bitcoin price prediction is difficult, regardless of the technical analysis (TA) indicators and experts’ views, therefore doing one’s own research and weighing personal risks is critical.

SEC Chairman Gary Gensler Speaks About Cryptocurrencies! - Bitcoin Sistemi


SEC Chairman Gary Gensler spoke about cryptocurrencies after the Robinhood move. Bitcoin rose above $65,000 yesterday as it started the new week positively.
However, it fell to $63,000 after the news that the SEC sent a Wells Notice to the US-based cryptocurrency platform Robinhood.


While the SEC-Robinhood move remains hot on the agenda, SEC Chairman Gary Gensler spoke to CNBC's Andrew Sorkin.
Answering the questions, Gensler said:






“Many cryptocurrencies are securities under the law. However, investors are not given the explanations they need.
“Cryptocurrencies continue to be a big part of fraud, fraud and problems in general.”

University Speaker Takes Ayahuasca, Shills Bitcoin, Gets Booed - Decrypt

We do the research, you get the alpha!Get exclusive reports and access to key insights on airdrops, NFTs, and more! Subscribe now to Alpha Reports and up your game!Go to Alpha ReportsThe boos from 60,000 new Ohio State University graduates and their guests swelled as alum and commencement speaker Chris Pan explained: “I see Bitcoin as a very misunderstood asset class.”Throughout history, Ohio State’s commencement speech has been delivered by notable figures including former President Barack Obama, former U.S. Chief Medical Advisor Dr. Anthony Fauci, and astronaut Neil Armstrong.This year it was Pan, a 1999 OSU alum who’s since gone on to become a social entrepreneur, musician, and inspirational speaker, who did the honors.“It is decentralized and finite which means no government can print more at will,” he said to a stadium full of graduates about BTC. “In the early days, the exchanges for Bitcoin were prone to hacks and fraud. But this issue has been solved with the recent launch of Bitcoin ETFs.”Moans and groans spread across the 60,000 people in attendance, as Pan continued to shill Bitcoin. “This is embarrassing,” a student can be heard saying a circulating video.Neither Pan nor Ohio State University immediately responded to Decrypt’s request for comment.A week prior to the speech, the founder of positive-affirmation jewelry business called MyIntent, took to Linkedin to explain that he’d “got some help from AI (Ayahuasca Intelligence)” to write his speech. People later took to Pan's Linkedin post to chastise him for using the speech as a "Bitcoin and bracelet ad."But the psychedelic fueled writing session didn’t lead to an inspiring message about ego and spirituality, but rather a lecture for “alpha males” about inflation and digital currency. Fortunately (or unfortunately) the drugs seemed to kick in when Pan walked past the lectern to give a Michael Scott-esque karaoke rendition of “What’s Up?” by 4 Non Blondes. He later also sang the Harry Dixon Loes classic, “This Little Light of Mine.”“I didn’t go to give a speech,” Pan said in an Instagram story after the event. “I went to share truth so we stop funding wars. We have to stop the bloodshed.”While he believed he was changing the world with his Bitcoin speech, some attendees thought it was “the worst commencement speech ever given anywhere.”According to Ohio local newsletter, The Rooster, Pan had bigger visions including “a shirtless dance number” which the university requested to be removed. And according to other sources that spoke with The Rooster, Pan was “very angry” and “the worst person” the source had ever worked with leading up to the ill-fated commencement speech.There's also a sobering fact about the OSU commencement: While the speech was going on, a person died after falling from the stands in the stadium. Some believed that the ceremony continuing, despite this shocking news, was distasteful—especially since there was no acknowledgement of the dire situation.Edited by Stacy Elliott.Stay on top of crypto news, get daily updates in your inbox.

How 'hostile' U.S crypto regulations will benefit Coinbase, per exec - AMBCrypto



Bitwise executive claims that Coinbase benefits from hostile U.S. crypto regulation.  
The executive projects that crypto startups will fall off the wayside. 

Coinbase is reportedly the key beneficiary amidst aggressive U.S. enforcement actions in the crypto space.
 Robinhood Crypto is the latest firm to receive Wells notice from the U.S. SEC (Securities and Exchange Commission).  
Recently, MetaMask and Uniswap received Wells notices, too, signaling the SEC’s intention to take enforcement action against the firms. 
The CFTC (Commodity Futures Trading Commission) Chair warned that the trend will intensify in the “next 6–24 months.”
Interestingly, Coinbase thrives in the U.S. regulatory heat, according to Bitwise’s CIO Matt Hougan. Penning his claims on X (formerly Twitter), the exec commented, 
“The hostile regulatory environment is creating an artificial “moat” for Coinbase’s business, helping sustain extremely high margins and allowing them to over-earn in the short-term.” 
Coinbase’s playbook in the U.S. regulatory heat 
Citing Coinbase’s successful diversified ventures like the Ethereum [ETH] layer 2 — Base, the Bitwise exec added that, 
“What’s impressive is that they are using this opportunity to both raise cash (now $7.1 billion) and massively diversified their business (see the growth in USDC, Base, international futures).”
The executive also highlighted that the high regulatory costs in the U.S. could stifle competition and deter new entrants in the space. 
“The capture is nearly perfect. The regulatory costs are too high for crypto native startups to compete (just imagine Coinbase’s legal bills). And the regulatory risk is too high for traditional firms to be tempted (just look at what’s happening to Robinhood).”
The regulatory pressure further consolidates Coinbase’s market share as the primary place for buying or selling digital assets and tokens in the U.S. 
As of Q4 2023, Coinbase commanded over 75% of the US market share. 
However, Uniswap [UNI], MetaMask, and even Robinhood Crypto are ready to fight back at SEC. Reacting to the SEC Wells notice, Robinhood CEO Vlad Tenev vowed that, 
“If necessary, we will use our resources to contest this matter in the courts, with the intent of both defending our crypto business and establishing regulatory clarity in the United States for the benefit of our customers.”
It remains to be seen how Coinbase market share will be affected if these embattled crypto firms win against the SEC.

Crypto Analyst Says Bitcoin Decline Is A Bear Trap, Can Price Recover Above $70,000? | Bitcoinist.com


								Bitcoin is currently on a recovery path, which tracks to analysts’ prediction that the price decline over the last two days has been more of a bear trap. Crypto analyst Orson Fawley elaborates more on this in his analysis and shows that the BTC price remains inherently bullish given its recent movements.
Bitcoin Recovery Is Strong
Fawley took to the TradingView website to share his analysis on Bitcoin, covering its surge from last weekend through to the price decline on Monday. The crypto analyst pointed out that with the weekend surge that began on Friday, Bitcoin was able to form a wide-ranging bullish D1 candlestick close to its high.

Now, the thing about wide-ranging D1 candlesticks is that they are used to measure buying pressure. Given that this candlestick closed near the Bitcoin high on Friday, Fawley explains that this means that the price was being pushed up due to strong and sustained BTC buying pressure.
Furthermore, the analyst explains that the candlestick had also broken Bitcoin’s previous “Inside Bar pattern”. This pretty much tells the same story as the wide-ranging D1 candlestick closing to close its high, meaning that buying pressure has been sustained for the digital asset.
As a result of this price surge, Bitcoin had been able to break above $60,000, which the crypt analyst identifies to be a major psychological level. Breaking this $60,000 level has been positive for the coin, and this fuels Fawley’s sentiment that the price decline was a false break. In other words, the decline was a bear trap.

Source: Tradingview.com
For those unfamiliar, bear traps are crashes in price after a period of price recovery that makes investors believe that the price has peaked. This draws in more bears who continue to short the price, thinking it will keep falling, but eventually, the price resumes its upward trajectory. Since the BTC price decline has been identified as a bear trap, it means that the cryptocurrency’s price is expected to continue its climb toward its all-time highs.
BTC Buying Pressure Continues
Fawley also analyzed the Bitcoin price going forward, using the 4-hour chart as the point of focus. In this chart, the crypto analyst confirmed that BTC had formed a V-shaped pattern as a result of the strong buying pressure from the bottom of the dip.

He also points out that the coin had broken above its downward trend line resistance. This comes as the Bitcoin price is forming an accumulation zone around its recent high, which has been around $64,000. According to the analyst, if Bitcoin “ can break above this price high and the PPZ area, Bitcoin H4 will revert to the uptrend structure on the H4 timeframe.”
Presently, the BTC price is still holding above $64,000 after a sharp surge in the early hours of Tuesday. Its daily volume has also risen 45%, lending credence to Fawley’s analysis that buying pressure remains strong. “The false break creating a bear trap on Friday and sustaining through Saturday and Sunday shows Bitcoin D1 is strengthening,” Fawley states.

Are Stablecoins the Future of Payments? New Study Raises Doubts


							

Over 90% of stablecoin activity comes from bots and traders, not everyday payments.



Lack of user-friendliness is a major barrier to wider adoption of stablecoins.



Tracking real crypto activity with blockchain data is difficult, leading to inflated figures.




A new study by Visa and Allium Labs shares the idea of stablecoins becoming widely used for everyday transactions. The study reveals that a staggering majority (over 90%) of stablecoin activity stems from bots and large-scale traders, not real people.



To measure genuine use, Visa developed a metric that excludes bot activity. This metric showed that only a tiny fraction, roughly $149 billion out of $2.2 trillion in total transactions in April, originated from real users. This finding contradicts the optimistic view of stablecoin proponents who believe these tokens will revolutionize payments.



Proponents highlight the benefits of stablecoins, such as instant settlement and minimal fees. However, experts suggest user-friendliness is a major hurdle. Additionally, tracking real crypto activity using blockchain data is inherently difficult, leading to inflated figures.



Financial technology giants like PayPal and Stripe are still exploring stablecoins. However, this study suggests these tokens have a long way to go before becoming a major force in the payments industry. Despite potential advantages, user adoption and data transparency remain significant challenges.



Further complicating the picture, some experts worry that the dominance of bot activity could create artificial price inflation for stablecoins. This in turn could also discourage legitimate users from entering the market and would create a monopoly in the market making less users for the limited real-world adoption.









Ethereum which is the world’s leading smart contract blockchain network, witnessed a massive surge in stablecoin volume last month in April. According to data the surge reached unexpected levels. This surge also includes flash loan activity, which also soared the figures.

Australian tax office targets 1.2M crypto investors for tax compliance - CoinJournal



                    

                    
Australian Tax Office seeks data from 1.2M crypto users for tax compliance.
Cryptocurrencies are classified as taxable assets in Australia and capital gains tax applies.
Global crackdown on crypto tax evasion has gained momentum, especially in Canada, Turkey, and the U.S.

In a move aimed at enforcing tax compliance within the burgeoning crypto market, the Australian Taxation Office (ATO) is reportedly seeking data from up to 1.2 million cryptocurrency exchange users.
The initiative, detailed in a notice seen by Reuters, underscores the ATO’s efforts to identify individuals who may have neglected their tax obligations related to crypto trading.
ATO going after tax evaders
The sought-after data includes a range of personal information such as users’ dates of birth, social media account details, and phone numbers, alongside transaction-related specifics like wallet addresses, types of coins traded, and bank account information.
This comprehensive approach aims to facilitate the identification of traders who have potentially failed to report their crypto-related income and pay the required capital gains tax on profits accrued from cryptocurrency transactions.
Unlike other foreign currencies, cryptocurrencies are classified as taxable assets in Australia, necessitating individuals engaged in crypto trading to fulfil their tax obligations.
According to the ATO, the complex and evolving nature of the cryptocurrency landscape often leads to challenges in tax compliance awareness. The agency noted in its notice that the ease of purchasing crypto assets using falsified information could attract individuals seeking to evade their tax obligations.
Crypto tax compliance across the globe
Australia is not alone in its pursuit of tax compliance within the crypto space. Across the globe, jurisdictions are stepping up efforts to collect unpaid taxes arising from digital asset gains. In Canada, the Canada Revenue Agency (CRA) is reportedly conducting over 400 audits related to cryptocurrency and investigating numerous crypto investors to recover unpaid taxes.
Similarly, Turkey is expected to introduce crypto-related legislation to establish a legal framework for crypto taxes later this year, reflecting the growing recognition of cryptocurrencies in economies worldwide.
In the United States, regulatory proposals aim to raise long-term capital gains tax rates, particularly targeting high-income investors. The Biden administration’s Federal Budget proposal includes plans for a 44.6% tax rate on long-term capital gains for individuals earning over $1 million annually. Additionally, there is a proposal for a 25% tax on unrealized gains for ultra-high-net-worth individuals, though its implementation remains uncertain.
While these regulatory measures signal a tightening of oversight in the cryptocurrency realm, the extent of their impact on market dynamics and investor behaviour remains to be seen.

Why Meme Coins Are Falling Despite Supercycle Hopes


Despite soaring expectations of a meme coin supercycle, recent performance data reveals significant downturns among these assets, challenging the bullish forecasts. 
Over the past month, popular meme coins like Dogecoin (DOGE) and Shiba Inu (SHIB) have seen declines ranging from 8% to 31%.
Meme Coins Dip as Interest Shifts to Bitcoin
Market analysts attribute the downtrend in meme coins to a shift in investor focus towards Bitcoin following its latest halving and the increasing popularity of exchange-traded funds (ETFs). While some investors had anticipated a surge across all cryptocurrencies, the reality has been more nuanced. 
The market capitalization of meme coins as stands at $54.639 billion, experiencing a daily drop of 2.7%. This decline is echoed in their trading volume, which is reported at $5 billion over the past 24 hours.

Despite the general downturn, not all meme coins have suffered losses. PEPE and BONK have bucked the trend, registering gains of 15.5% and 4.3% over the last month, respectively. These outliers highlight the volatile and unpredictable nature of meme coin investments.

Meme Coin Prices. Source: CoinGecko
The broader narrative among investors suggests that the onset of a supercycle, fueled by Bitcoin’s halving and ETFs, could eventually benefit the meme coin sector.  This optimism is based on the expectation that Bitcoin’s reduced supply post-halving could drive up its price, potentially leading investors to seek higher returns in more speculative assets.
However, serious market analysts and entities such as venture capital firm a16z have expressed concerns about the sustainability of meme coins, citing them as potential risks to the cryptocurrency market’s credibility. Even Crypto Koryo, a data scientist, suggests that the meme coins have turned into high-risk, low-reward.

“Considering the vast majority of these new meme coins will go to $0, you need a lot of diversification if you want to play that game. If there is too little diversification, your portfolio could go to $0 anytime. Too much diversification, and even a 20x on one of them, wouldn’t impact the PnL by much,” Koryo explains.

In light of these dynamics, the future of meme coins remains uncertain. While some predict a rebound driven by broader cryptocurrency gains and increased investment in high-risk assets, others caution against the speculative nature of such investments.

Dog-themed cryptocurrency Shiba Inu (SHIB) has seen an astounding surge in whale activity, recording 382.88% in large transaction volume.Within the last 24 hours, Shiba Inu's large transaction volume climbed from 507.81 billion SHIB to 2.54 trillion SHIB, per data from on-chain analytics platform IntoTheBlock.The volume of large transactions valued at $100,000 or more has skyrocketed 382.88% accordingly, totaling $60.56 million. This surge coincides with a determined effort by bullish traders to uphold a critical 45 trillion SHIB range, reflecting the intense battle unfolding between bullish and bearish forces for the Shiba Inu price. Global In/Out of the Money, Courtesy: IntoTheBlockAccording to IntoTheBlock data, 45.78 trillion SHIB were bought by 50,590 addresses at SHIB's current trading price range between $0.000023 and $0.000025 at an average price of $0.000024. At the time of writing, Shiba Inu was teetering closer to the lower end of the range, down 5% in the last 24 hours to $0.00002363. As the battle between bulls and bears intensifies, the significance of Shiba Inu's current trading price range cannot be overstated. Its successful defense might trigger renewed bullish momentum, potentially propelling Shiba Inu to new highs. Conversely, a breach of this support at this range could invite further selling pressure, testing the resolve of bullish traders and signaling a shift in market sentiment.Against the backdrop of a bullish defense of the critical 45 trillion SHIB range, the stage is set for a high-stakes showdown between bulls and bears, with the SHIB community bracing for the outcome. If bulls prevail, SHIB might confront its next resistance in the $0.000025 to $0.000030 region; if bears succeed in pulling the SHIB price lower, support is envisaged in the $0.000019 and $0.000023 range.

Empire Newsletter: A busy crypto lawsuit season looms - Blockworks


Another one bites the dust
And then there were three. 
Robinhood has become the latest company to receive a crypto-related Wells notice from the Securities and Exchange Commission.
If you don’t know what a Wells notice is, you might be new to crypto. The notice is basically a heads-up given to a company that the SEC completed an investigation and may pursue an enforcement action against them. 
The notice doesn’t always mean that legal action will play out, but this is crypto.
This time last year, for example, we were playing the waiting game after Coinbase was served with a Wells notice in March. The SEC then filed a suit against the exchange company in June. 
As I previously reported, if that timeline holds, we could be looking at a summer legal action — similar to what we saw with Coinbase. 
So if things head to court, what happens exactly?
Robinhood, as part of its disclosures, said the SEC alleged that it violated 15(a) and 17A of the Securities Exchange Act. If that rings a bell, it’s because both Coinbase and Binance were hit with similar charges. 
17A focuses on clearing agencies and 15(a) centers around broker-dealer registration. It’s unclear if the SEC will seek charges regarding tokens it believes are securities, like we’ve seen in other cases. 
For its part, Robinhood has tried to stay out of the SEC’s spotlight by delisting tokens that the regulatory agency has targeted, such as Solana’s SOL, Polygon’s MATIC, and Cardano’s ADA. Unfortunately, it doesn’t seem like any company offering crypto services can avoid Gensler’s ire.
“​​The potential action may involve a civil injunctive action, public administrative proceeding, and/or a cease-and-desist proceeding,” Robinhood warned in its disclosure. 
Putting aside the potential charges, let’s talk about Robinhood’s chief legal and compliance officer, Dan Gallagher. 
Gallagher is actually no stranger to the SEC, having served as a Commissioner between 2011 to 2015. He worked in other positions within the SEC as well. 
Gallagher said yesterday that he was “disappointed” and insisted that the “assets listed on our platform are not securities.” He called the case against Robinhood Crypto “weak.” Perhaps Gensler’s met his match?
Either way, Robinhood’s not alone in the SEC’s spotlight.
Though Consensys — another company that was served with a Wells notice — may face different charges in a potential lawsuit from the regulator. We know from the lawsuit Consensys filed against the SEC that its Wells notice centered on two of its product offerings: MetaMask Swaps and MetaMask Staking. 
One aspect could look similar, however. 
Consensys said the SEC held a telephone conference between the two parties during which SEC staffers said they believed the Brooklyn-based company was operating as an unregistered broker-dealer because of the MetaMask Swaps software. 
The SEC also took issue with the staking program — which would echo what we’ve seen in the Coinbase and Binance cases. Consensys violated the Securities Act, the SEC allegedly said, because it offered and sold unregistered securities.
The third company in our roundup, Uniswap, represents the most unknowns so far. While Uniswap disclosed its Wells notice, it didn’t disclose any specifics. Uniswap didn’t respond to a request for comment on the details, either. 
As our own Casey Wagner pointed out in this newsletter a few weeks ago, Uniswap chief legal officer Marvin Ammori said securities regulators could — as they did with Binance and Coinbase — charge the firm with operating as an unregistered exchange and broker. 
It seems likely that Uniswap could also face securities charges as well, based on what we’ve seen with pending lawsuits and the other Wells notices. 
So the summer of fun, with the bull market looking like it’s just getting started, might be interrupted by a few more lawsuits. Yay.

Robinhood’s stock was down nearly a percent at the close yesterday, but it’s still up 95% over the past year.
Bitcoin, trying to regain $65,000, dropped back to $64,000 after Robinhood disclosed its Wells notice.
Grayscale’s bitcoin ETF posted another day of inflows, a record for the fund, on Monday. The firm saw positive flows of nearly $4 million.
Ethereum notched $30 million of inflows, finally breaking a seven-week streak of outflows, per CoinShares data.
Hong Kong’s new ETH and bitcoin ETFs recorded $307 million in inflows last week, according to the data.

Bubbles are mathematically impossible
If crypto were the ‘98 Chicago Bulls, Paradigm and a16z would be Michael Jordan and Scottie Pippen.
A few editions ago, we looked at the companies listed in a16z Crypto’s portfolio for a temperature check on how those bets are playing out this bull market cycle. 
Time to compare that to Paradigm.
Paradigm has fewer investments listed than a16z — 57 to 95. A similar percentage of startups have issued their own tokens, around 40%. 
a16z Crypto says it has $7.6 billion in assets under management in its four crypto funds. Paradigm, meanwhile, reportedly had $8.7 billion toward the end of 2022 — when crypto markets were bottoming out. 
Considering how wild these assets can be, let’s just call it even.
Complete details of either firm’s investments in the crypto space aren’t public knowledge, so we’re in the dark on size, mixture of equity and tokens, vesting schedules and cost basis. 
That means we can’t know exactly how well the funds are doing. We can still figure out what their star performers might be, at least out of the portfolio companies with native tokens.

Let’s say our current bull market began in mid-November, when bitcoin bottomed out around $16,500. 
In Paradigm’s case, it discloses unspecified holdings in bitcoin, ether, Coinbase stock, 23 crypto entities with their own tokens, and 33 without.
Most cryptocurrencies have underperformed the top two cryptocurrencies, with only four beating bitcoin up until the end of April, and another three came out ahead of ether.
Just like in a16z’s case, Sky Mavis’ RON token, the native asset for gaming-centric layer-1 Ronin, is the standout by far, having multiplied 11 times in price. 
Next were governance tokens for DeFi structured products protocol Ribbon Finance, trader-focused NFT marketplace Blur and DAI issuer MakerDAO’s, which have more than tripled.
Worst were also governance tokens. JET, for Solana-native lending app Jet Protocol, and FLX, for non-pegged stablecoin protocol Reflexer, which manages RAI. JET has fallen 97% this bull market, FLX has shed 60%.
When we looked at tokens issued by a16z’s portfolio companies, the median return was about 130%, largely thanks to RON and Solana, with about 15% of tokens losing value in the current cycle.

In Paradigm’s portfolio, including bitcoin, ether and Coinbase stock, the median is 58%, with about one-third posting negative returns.
Granted, all this says very little about the potential gains, both unrealized and unrealized, of both funds’ crypto ventures. It also doesn’t at all reflect the health of the companies tied to each token, only market sentiment.
It does, however, show how few VC-backed tokens have outperformed bitcoin in this bull market so far. 
Food for thought for those playing along at home.

The Works

Australia’s tax office is probing crypto traders in the country, according to AFR.
Fintech firm Revolut is launching a crypto exchange for traders in the UK. 
The SEC delayed another spot ether ETF late Monday. 
Block said Monday that it’s planning to offer $1.5 billion worth of senior notes.
Apple is developing its own data center chip for artificial intelligence, the WSJ reports.

The Morning Riff
Another day, another series of “Satoshi-era coins on the move” headlines. 
Yesterday, a clutch of bitcoins worth some $44 million “awoke” according to transaction data. 
It’s long been the case that crypto media jumps to report on anything related to old coins — that is, any holdings that haven’t budged in a decade or more. 
But this has seemed especially true in recent months, with bitcoin’s recent all-time highs prompting long-time holders to blow the dust off their wallets. A recent survey from Fortune and Chainalysis posits that old coin movements have become routine as of late.
Should people pay so much attention to these Lazarus-style hodlers? Maybe, if you’re the sort who cares a great deal about how many coins are effectively out of circulation because they were previously thought to be “lost.”
Me? I think people are looking for entertainment; if the number isn’t going up, at least somewhere, a number is doing something.

Hong Kong central bank forms community to explore assets tokenization

The Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA), the financial regulator and central bank of Hong Kong, is collaborating with the industry to explore asset tokenization.HKMA officially announced on May 7 that it will form a special community comprising industry representatives and regulators to develop tokenization standards.Called “Project Ensemble Architecture Community,” the community aims to supervise and support the development of tokenization projects in Hong Kong.The initiative is also designed to promote and support interoperability among wholesale central bank digital currencies (wCBDC) — a type of digital money used among banks and financial institutions. According to the announcement, the community will initially focus on establishing a mechanism to support seamless interbank settlement of tokenized deposits through wCBDC for tokenized asset transactions.At launch, the Project Ensemble Architecture Community will comprise regulators like HKMA, Hong Kong’s Securities and Futures Commission, the BIS Innovation Hub Hong Kong Centre, and the CBDC Expert Group. The private sector is represented by seven members, including Bank of China (Hong Kong), Hang Seng Bank, HSBC, Standard Chartered Hong Kong, HashKey Group, Ant Digital Technologies and Microsoft Hong Kong.Together, the companies and authorities are expected to design and launch the Project Ensemble Sandbox, which is targeted to launch around mid-2024 to facilitate further research and testing of tokenization use cases.Related: RWA protocols are closing in on $8B total value locked: Messari“The formation of the Community is based on a range of careful considerations, including the members’ expertise in contributing to the development of the tokenization market in Hong Kong, experience and competency in relevant fields and innovative capability,” HKMA said in the announcement, adding:“The HKMA will be working closely with the industry, and review the size and composition of the Community as and when deemed appropriate.”HKMA’s announcement comes a few months after the authority first disclosed its Project Ensemble to support the development of the Hong Kong tokenization market. Tokenization is the process of issuing a digital representation of real-world things such as fiat currencies, equity, commodities, real estate and others. Blockchain-based real-world tokenization (RWA) has emerged as one of the key trends in 2024 as investors look for new ways to diversify their portfolios.According to some forecasts, RWA tokenization could potentially revolutionize multiple industries and grow into a $16 trillion market by 2030.Magazine: Hong Kong Bitcoin ETF launch in ‘top 20%,’ STRK scam suspect busted: Asia Express

US Bitcoin ETFs see record outflows as Hong Kong counterparts thrive

CoinShares’ latest weekly report revealed that crypto-related investment products saw their fourth consecutive week of negative flows, dominated by the “measurable outflows from the newly issued ETFs in the US.”According to the report, the market saw an outflow totaling $251 million, with the Newborn Nine spot Bitcoin ETFs accounting for over 60%, or $156 million, of these flows.James Butterfill, CoinShares head of research, said:“We estimate the average purchase price of these ETFs since launch to be $62,200 per bitcoin, as the price fell 10% below that level, it may have triggered automatic sell orders.”A breakdown of the flows showed that Fidelity’s FBTC saw the highest outflow amount, with $131 million exiting the fund, followed by Ark 21 Shares’ ARKB, which saw outflows amounting to $84 million.Table showing the year-to-date, month-to-date, and weekly crypto ETP flows (Source: CoinShares)Meanwhile, BlackRock’s IBIT saw a modest negative flow of $24 million, while Grayscale’s Bitcoin ETF continued its outflow trend, with $277 million withdrawn during the period.The performance of these ETFs pushed outflows from the United States to $504 million. Notably, Canada, Switzerland, and Germany also saw outflows totaling $9.6 million, $9.8 million, and $7.3 million, respectively.However, despite the performance of US-based spot Bitcoin ETFs, the newly launched spot-based Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs in Hong Kong saw $307 million in inflows during the first week of their trading.Ethereum and Polkadot draw inflowsAcross assets, Bitcoin saw outflows totaling $284 million, propelling its month-to-date outflow to $291 million.CryptoSlate’s previous reports found that crypto investors increasingly sought exposure to altcoins while reducing their exposure to flagship digital currencies like Bitcoin.Table showing the year-to-date, month-to-date, and weekly crypto asset flows (Source: CoinShares)This trend continued this week as altcoins like Avalanche, Cardano, and Polkadot saw modest inflows of approximately $0.5 million, $0.4 million, and $0.3 million, respectively.Notably, Ethereum broke its 7-week spell of negative flows, seeing $30 million of inflows last week.

Whale Alert, an X account known for tracking large transactions on the blockchain, has reported a significant movement of Chainlink (LINK) tokens. According to its tweet, a staggering 3.7 million LINK tokens, equivalent to over $53 million at current market prices, were transferred from an unknown wallet to another unknown wallet.While such large-scale transfers are not uncommon in the world of cryptocurrencies, they often spark curiosity and speculation among traders and enthusiasts alike. In this instance, the reasons behind this massive transfer remain shrouded in mystery, leaving analysts to speculate on potential implications for the LINK ecosystem.One potential concern that arises from such sizable transfers is the possibility of a sell-off, wherein a large holder or group of holders liquidates their assets, potentially causing downward pressure on the token's price. However, despite the magnitude of this transfer, immediate market reactions have been muted, with the LINK price showing resilience in the face of uncertainty.Chainlink market sentimentAt the time of writing, the price of Chainlink stands at $14.51, marking a slight decline of 3.60% over the past 24 hours. Despite this short-term dip, the cryptocurrency has exhibited strong performance over the course of the week, with a notable increase of 8.83% in its value.Furthermore, market data indicates a notable uptick in trading activity for Chainlink, with the 24-hour trading volume experiencing a substantial surge of 27.62%. Currently, the total trading volume for LINK stands at $319,020,709, reflecting heightened interest and engagement within the crypto market.The significance of this transfer extends beyond mere numerical values, serving as a reminder of the dynamic nature of the crypto landscape. As investors and analysts continue to monitor developments surrounding Chainlink, attention will undoubtedly be focused on how this substantial transfer may influence market dynamics in the days and weeks ahead.

Crypto Crackdown Coming? CFTC Chair Predicts Enforcement Surge - Benzinga

The head of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC), Rostin Behnam, issued a warning to the cryptocurrency industry, predicting a surge in enforcement actions as the market rebounds and attracts more retail investors.What Happened: Speaking at the recent Milken Institute’s 27th annual Global Conference on Monday, he said, “From my standpoint as a regulator, we’re going to probably see in the next six to 18 months or six to 24 months, another cycle of enforcement actions because of this cycle of asset appreciation and interest by retail investors.” He highlighted the lack of a robust regulatory framework which, in his view, leads to ongoing issues of fraud and manipulation within the sector, The Block reported.The context for Behnam's remarks includes recent preliminary enforcement actions signaled by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) against several crypto entities. Notably, on the same day, Robinhood Markets disclosed receiving a Wells Notice from the SEC, suggesting potential securities violations by its cryptocurrency division.Similar notices were also issued to other key players in the crypto world, including Consensys and Uniswap, last month.This uptick in regulatory scrutiny follows a series of actions taken by both the CFTC and SEC against major cryptocurrency platforms such as Binance and FTX over the past year, reflecting a tightening landscape for crypto operations in the United States.Also Read: Bitcoin Spot ETFs Register $217M Net Inflows On MondayWhy It Matters: Additionally, during the conference, Behnam was questioned about the progress of proposed stablecoin legislation, which has been in development for over 20 months by key figures like House Financial Services Committee Chair Patrick McHenry, (R-N.C.), and Rep. Maxine Waters, (D-Calif.). Behnam expressed skepticism about the bill’s timely passage, citing limited legislative days and current political dynamics.“There’s a lot of momentum, there is a lot of desire, I think there’s going to be efforts by members on both sides, leadership on both sides, but getting legislation done these days is difficult,” he remarked.A particular point of contention in the stablecoin discussions has been the determination of whether state regulators or the federal government should oversee stablecoin issuers. Efforts to include the stablecoin bill in crucial upcoming Federal Aviation Administration legislation have stalled, as indicated by a Democratic aide last week.Behnam’s comments underscore the complexities and challenges facing the rapidly evolving cryptocurrency market as it attracts increasing scrutiny from U.S. regulators.What’s Next: These topics are expected to be thoroughly explored at Benzinga’s upcoming Future of Digital Assets event on Nov. 19.Read Next: Why Michael Saylor Sees Bitcoin As ‘Apex Property Of The Human Race’Image: Shutterstock

Bitcoin Price Exits Danger Zone: What Now?


Bitcoin price has once again shown its resilience by navigating through a volatile period known as the “Danger Zone.”
This phase follows Bitcoin’s halving event, which significantly impacts its price. Emerging stronger, Bitcoin is now drawing investors’ attention.
Bitcoin Price Moves From Danger to Accumulation
Technical analyst Rekt Capital describes the “Danger Zone” as three weeks of potential downside volatility after Bitcoin’s halving, a recurring cycle in its history.
In the past, this phase saw sharp price drops, like the 17% decline in 2016. However, the latest cycle experienced a milder 6.5% dip, indicating a maturing market. This downturn was brief, as Bitcoin soon rallied by 15%, confidently exiting the lower bounds of its re-accumulation range.

Bitcoin’s resilience underlines its consistent cycle post-halving. Despite expected volatility, the accumulation phase started earlier than predicted, with a strong support level that investors quickly leveraged.

“Time-wise, however, it isn’t – so we’ll need to wait a week for the confirmation of this zone being over for it to be official, but it’s a mere formality at this point,” Rekt Capital said. 

As a result, the market’s response has preemptively quelled fears, suggesting that the period of significant price corrections might already be over.

Bitcoin Price Analysis. Source: Rekt Capital

The broader economic environment bolsters Bitcoin’s positive prospects, especially the weakening US dollar. Notably, macroeconomist Henrik Zeberg recently highlighted a downturn in the US Dollar Index (DXY), which tracks the dollar against six major currencies.
Zeberg links this trend with falling yields on government bonds, creating a prime environment for cryptocurrencies.
This observation is crucial, given Bitcoin’s historical inverse correlation with the US dollar. When the DXY hit a two-decade peak in September 2022 amid aggressive Federal Reserve policies, Bitcoin fell to about $16,000. With the Fed pausing rate hikes as inflation eases, the DXY has dropped 2% since the month began, enhancing conditions for Bitcoin’s rise.


“Market participants were expecting a 75 to 100bps cut in interest rates during 2024, but the Federal Reserve has kept interest rates stable in response to the on-going inflation. Current expectations are for a 25 to 50bps cut during Q4 2024, with the first 25bps cut potentially occurring in October or November 2024 if inflation data don’t worsen in the coming months,” Matteo Greco, Research Analyst at Fineqia, told BeInCrypto.

This scenario is particularly relevant as Bitcoin surpasses 1 billion on-chain transactions. It is marking its growing adoption and integration into the global financial system. The favorable macroeconomic conditions and inherent market strength suggest Bitcoin may see sustained growth.

“1 Bitcoin is about ten times more scarce than 1 kilo of gold and is similarly priced. It should probably get repriced this cycle so that Bitcoin flips gold, passing gold parity at around 10 kilos per Bitcoin,” said Adam Back, Blockstream CEO.

As Bitcoin exits its “Danger Zone,” the road ahead is ripe with growth potential, driven by macroeconomic trends and its innate market resilience. With historical patterns as a guide and current economic indicators favoring cryptocurrencies, Bitcoin‘s post-halving path looks set for a bullish continuation.

Crypto researcher uncovers alarming tokenomics for this project: ‘Sheer greed’


In a recent post on X, Justin Bons—the founder and CIO of Cyber Capital, Europe’s oldest cryptocurrency fund—raised serious concerns about the Sui Network (SUI) project’s tokenomics. Bons, a full-time crypto researcher since 2014, claims that the project’s token distribution is marred by centralization, lack of disclosure, and “unbridled greed.”
According to Bons, SUI claims to have a capped supply of 10 billion tokens, with 52% being “unallocated” until 2030. However, he points out that over 8 billion SUI tokens are currently being staked, with founders holding an alarming 84% of the staked supply.

“SUI is centralized. The founders control the MAJORITY of supply without lock-ins and ZERO legal guarantees!”
– Justin Bons



Cyber Capital’s CIO accuses the team of deceptive communication, stating that “the legal fine print protects them, as the truth is sobering.” He claims that the chart published by the SUI Foundation is “a lie,” as the staked SUI implies no lock-in period at all. Moreover, the Foundation has refused to disclose the addresses controlling the “unallocated” supply, raising further suspicions.

Sui Network’s (SUI) alarming tokenomics
The researcher also highlights the substantial amounts of SUI tokens allocated to various entities, including 160 million to Mysten Labs (SUI’s for-profit arm), 600 million to “early contributors,” and close to 1.5 billion to VCs. Additionally, over 1 billion tokens are reserved for “stake subsidies,” which Bons claims will return to the founders who already control most of the stake.
Sui Network token unlocks. Source: TokenUnlocksApp
Justin Bons criticizes the lack of a public sale, calling SUI a “100% pre-mine.” He laments the growing trend of greed in cryptocurrencies‘ tokenomics over the past few years, with SUI being one of the worst examples.

“The sheer greed of SUI’s distribution is mindblowing,” he states, emphasizing that “SUI still refuses to give full disclosure on the MAJORITY of SUI supply…”

The researcher warns of the extreme risks posed by SUI’s centralized control, as the leadership effectively controls network consensus and has the power to crash the market overnight by selling their tokens. However, Bons suggests that a more likely scenario is a gradual selling of tokens to “slowly bleed retail investors dry.”
Justin Bons’ proposed solution
Despite his strong criticism, Justin Bons acknowledges that SUI’s technology is promising, with its object-centric model and novel solution to state bloat. He proposes two potential solutions to address the tokenomics issue:
Either burn the unallocated supply or turn control over to a decentralized on-chain governance treasury.
Yet, Bons concludes his post by emphasizing that “things are rarely black & white in crypto; nothing is all good or all bad.” He describes SUI as “a permissionless and public blockchain with a predatory supply distribution, good and evil!”
Nonetheless, he believes that SUI can redeem itself if the project’s leaders surrender control of the “unallocated” supply.

The Focus of Attention of Corporate Giant Whales Has Changed: “They Sold Bitcoin, After a Long Time, They Bought Ethereum and These Altcoins!” - Bitcoin Sistemi

While the rise in Bitcoin and altcoins over the weekend strengthened investors' rally expectations, Coinshares published its weekly cryptocurrency report.
Stating that it experienced an outflow of $251 million in cryptocurrency investment products last week, Coinshares said that the outflows reached the fourth week in a row.



“Cryptocurrency investment products saw outflows totaling $251 million for the fourth week in a row. These global outflows dwarf the $307 million inflows into Hong Kong ETFs.”

Ethereum (ETH) Sales Are Over!
When looking at crypto funds individually, it was seen that the majority of fund outflows were in Bitcoin.
While BTC was the only cryptocurrency to experience an outflow of $284 million, the largest altcoin Ethereum (ETH) broke its 7-week outflow streak and saw an inflow of $30 million.





When we look at other altcoins, Avalanche (AVAX) experienced an inflow of $0.5 million, Litecoin (LTC) $0.1 million, Polkadot (DOT) $0.3 million, and Solana (SOL) $0.3 million.

“As always, Bitcoin was the main focus, seeing an outflow of $284 million. Unusually, BTC was the only cryptocurrency to see an outflow.
Ethereum saw inflows of $30 million last week, breaking its 7-week outflow streak.
A wide variety of altcoins have seen inflow; “The most important ones were Avalanche, Cardano, and Polkadot, which saw inflows of $0.5 million, $0.4 million, and $0.3 million, respectively.”

When looking at regional fund inflows and outflows, it was seen that the USA ranked first with an outflow of 504 million dollars.


After the USA, Sweden ranked second with 30.3 million dollars.
Against these outflows, Hong Kong lost 306.5 million dollars; Brazil experienced an inflow of 3.7 million dollars.

Revolut Lists BONK, FLOKI on Standalone Crypto Exchange Launch - DailyCoin


        
Two popular dog-themed coins enter Revolut’s new crypto ecosystem.



The Revolut X platform centers on advanced traders and imposes smaller fees.



Besides over 100 cryptos in selection, Revolut offers new research tools.
The London-headquartered neobank Revolut is launching its highly anticipated Revolut X crypto exchange today. It is the first bank to have a standalone crypto exchange. Revolut announced an advanced cryptocurrency exchange in February 2024, with the United Kingdom being the first destination for the new crypto platform.Currently, Revolut X takes no maker fees, while the taker fees are limited to 0.09%. Along with the new crypto platform, Revolut listed multiple popular memecoins, including Bonk (BONK), Floki (FLOKI), and Worldcoin (WLD). With over 40 million customers globally, Revolut now supports over 100 cryptocurrencies.What Does Revolut X Bring to the Crypto Table?Besides offering crypto services outside the main Revolut app, Revolut X offers a bundle of financial research tools. Tools like the Relative Strength Index (RSI) can help advanced traders understand when the analyzed cryptocurrency is overbought or oversold.
Besides the more elaborate crypto analytics, Revolut X brings significantly lower transaction fees than the standard in-app exchange. Focused on advanced traders, Revolut X drives a bargain with 0.09% taker fees, compared to Revolut’s in-app crypto fees of up to 1.5%.Following the news, canine coins Bonk and Floki slipped by 7% over the past 24 hours as the general crypto markets faced a slight correction on Tuesday. In contrast, Sam Altman’s WLD soared in 24-hour trading volume, topping $545M on all platforms. The digital identity project’s native WLD coin retraced just 3.9% after inking 29.9% gains over the past seven days, trading at $6.12 as of press time.On the Flipside
Due to the Financial Conduct Authority’s (FCA) revision of regulation on crypto promotions, Revolut suspended their crypto offerings for British business clients.



Revolut X has yet to be released to clients in the European Union (EU) and the United States (USA).
Why This MattersMerging traditional finance with blockchain technology has played a key role in crypto adoption, as seen earlier this year with the introduction of Bitcoin Spot exchange-traded funds (ETFs).

Bitcoin's April plunge leads to $2.92 billion in spot outflows | CryptoSlate

Quick TakeBitcoin faced massive selling pressure in April 2024, recording its most significant monthly decline of 15% since November 2022, when it dropped over 16%. CryptoSlate previously analyzed the factors contributing to the dip, finding that the conclusion of the US tax season, compounded by various economic factors, prompted the sell-off. However, Bitcoin rebounded most of its losses in April and May.Bitcoin appeared to have hit a local bottom on May 1, hitting a low of roughly $56,800. It has since climbed over 11%.Graph showing the price of BTCUSD from April 1 to May 7, 2024 (Source: TradingView)According to data from Coinglass, Bitcoin saw substantial net outflows during April and early May, exceeding $500 million on two occasions: on April 13 ($547 million) amidst tensions in the Middle East and on May 1 ($536 million). The May 1 outflows coincided with the largest recorded outflow from the Bitcoin ETFs since its launch. Between April 9 and May 1, nearly every day saw net outflows, with only two exceptions.Chart showing spot Bitcoin inflows (green) and outflows (red) from July 13, 2023, to May 1, 2024 (Source: Coinglass)Coinglass data shows that over the past 30 days, Bitcoin saw $2.92 billion in net outflows.Table showing the netflow data for BTC (Source: Coinglass)In terms of price performance since the April 20 halving, BTC was trading at approximately $64,000, slightly ahead of the current price. This represents the second-weakest post-halving performance, just ahead of the first epoch. However, historical data suggests that most Bitcoin price gains come after the halving. Therefore, it would be premature to assess BTC’s performance in the current cycle at this stage.Graph showing Bitcoin’s price performance after previous halvings (Source: Glassnode)

Amid a fluctuating Bitcoin price and growing concern within the crypto community, Michael Saylor, the CEO of MicroStrategy, has emerged as a beacon of bullish optimism. Over the past 24 hours, Bitcoin's value has experienced mixed movements, dropping from $65,500 to $62,830 on Monday before rebounding to $63,600 today. However, the broader trend on the daily chart is disconcerting, with Bitcoin registering another lower high since mid-March, adding to anxiety following a recent lower low.For those unfamiliar with trading terminology, a "lower high" occurs when the peak price of an asset is lower than the previous high, indicating a potential downward trend, while a "lower low" signifies a new trough lower than the previous low, suggesting further declines.BTC to USD by CoinMarketCapDespite these concerning signals, Michael Saylor remains resolute in his bullish stance. In his latest communication, he advocates for embracing bullish sentiment, urging investors to "Run with the Bulls." Saylor's unwavering confidence in Bitcoin serves as a counterbalance to prevailing uncertainties, offering reassurance to those wavering on the cryptocurrency's future prospects.However, cautionary tones persist, reminding investors that Saylor's optimism does not guarantee stability. The fate of Bitcoin hinges on the actions of buyers, with the potential for a collapse looming if their support falters. Analysts warn that if bearish sentiment prevails, BTC could revisit key support levels at $61,000 and the $56,000 range, where significant liquidity is concentrated.

WIF's road to $5 - After latest 20% price hike, how feasible is it? - AMBCrypto



WIF’s price rose by double digits in the last week.
However, bulls do not yet have a clear path to victory.

The price of leading meme coin dogwifhat [WIF] crossed above its 20-day small moving average on the 3rd of May, and the token’s price has since risen by 20%. 
When an asset’s price rises above its 20-day SMA, it suggests that the short-term trend for the asset is upward. 
Market participants interpret this to mean that the asset’s current price is higher than the average price of the past 20 days, suggesting that buyers may be in control, and the price may continue to climb. 
WIF’s next direction?
According to CoinMarketCap, at press time, WIF exchanged hands at $3.26. 
The meme coin’s Fibonacci retracement assessed on a one-day chart revealed that if bullish sentiment persists, its next price point is $3.86.
For this to happen, there has to be a sustained demand for WIF. However, readings from the token’s key momentum indicators showed that the market is generally in a state of balance between buyers and sellers.
As of this writing, WIF’s Relative Strength Index (RSI) and Money Flow Index (MFI) were 55.06 and 50.51, respectively. 
These values showed that neither WIF buyers nor sellers clearly controlled the market at press time.
Further, WIF’s Chaikin Money Flow (CMF) was in a downtrend at the time of writing. This indicator measures the flow of money into and out of the asset over a specified period of time. 
This CMF decline occurred during the same period when WIF’s price recorded a rally, thereby creating a bearish divergence. 
This negative divergence is often interpreted as a signal of a potential reversal in the price trend.
If it persists, WIF’s price may lose momentum, and a correction may follow, as it means that the rally can no longer be backed by any real demand. 
If this happens, and the bullish projection made above is invalidated, WIF’s price may fall under $3 to exchange hands at $2.8.

It is also key to note that although WIF’s price has recorded gains in the past few weeks, bearish sentiments remain in the market. 
According to Santiment, despite last week’s double-digit price rally, WIF’s Weighted Sentiment has remained negative, sitting at -0.46 at press time.

Here’s How This Ethereum Whale Made $16 Million From A Single Trade


                            An Ethereum whale was recently revealed to have made $16 million from a single trade involving the second-largest crypto token by market cap. This whale’s story again highlights how conviction in an investment can be very rewarding in the crypto space. 
How This Ethereum Whale Made $16 Million In A Single Trade
On-chain analytics platform Lookonchain revealed in an X (formerly Twitter) post that the whale withdrew 12,906 ETH ($24.39 million) from Binance when the crypto token was still trading at $1,890 a year ago. With Ethereum currently trading at around $3,100, the whale’s ETH investment is now worth over $40 million, signifying a profit of about $16 million. 

Interestingly, his profits from this trade will likely be more than $16 million, as the trader deposited those tokens in the staking platform Lido when he withdrew them from Binance last year. That means he also earned significant staking rewards to go alongside his $16 million profit. 
On-chain data shows the whale recently withdrew 7,000 ETH ($21 million) from Lido back to Binance but has yet to offload these tokens. However, that is something to keep an eye on as the whale offloading those tokens could have a negative impact on Ethereum’s price. 
Tron’s founder, Justin Sun, looks to be another Ethereum whale that could make such significant returns on their ETH investment. Two wallets believed to belong to Sun are reported to have accumulated 295,757 ETH ($891M) at an average price of $3,014 since February 12. Since then, Sun has made some notable moves that could be profitable for him.
One such move is that the Tron founder recently deposited 120,000 eETH into Swell L2, a liquid restaking protocol. Although Sun claims that this move isn’t profit-motivated, he could still make huge profits from his venture, considering that restaking is one of the leading narratives at the moment. 
The Bull Run Presenting A Lot Of Opportunities
There have been a lot of reports highlighting how crypto investors and traders have been making life-changing, which suggests that the bull run is already in full force despite Bitcoin’s unimpressive price action lately. One opportunity that these traders have taken advantage of in this market cycle is meme coins. 

Before the bull run began, there was the belief that memes would be one of the leading narratives, and that has been the case. Bitcoinist recently reported two Solana meme coin traders turned $6,400 into $8 million. Meanwhile, Lookonchain revealed a Solana trader who turned 60 SOL ($8,673) into $1.26 million in 2 months, making a 144x return on his investment.

Commencement Exercises Chaos! Drug-Induced Bitcoin Speech Gets Booed At Ohio State


								Commencement speeches are supposed to be inspirational send-offs for graduating students, filled with wisdom and hope for the future. But at Ohio State University’s ceremony this past Sunday, the chosen speaker, Chris Pan, delivered a speech that left many scratching their heads and some downright booing.

Pan, a 1999 graduate and entrepreneur, ignited controversy by admitting on LinkedIn that he wrote the first draft of his speech under the influence of ayahuasca, a powerful psychedelic drug. This revelation was only the beginning of the unusual turn of events.
Bitcoin Takes Center Stage
While many expected Pan to impart conventional wisdom about navigating careers and life after graduation, his speech took a sharp turn towards the world of cryptocurrency. Pan, a self-proclaimed Bitcoin enthusiast, heavily promoted the digital currency as a hedge against inflation, urging graduates to invest.
This endorsement was met with audible boos from the audience, broadcasted live on the university’s livestream.
“Saving isn’t enough anymore,” Pan declared. “Inflation’s out of control, that’s why everything costs more! Bitcoin offers a misunderstood asset class. It’s decentralized and finite, meaning no government can just print more at will.”

University Clarifies Stance On Bitcoin
Ohio State University was quick to distance itself from Pan’s Bitcoin advocacy. A university spokesperson declined to comment on the specific content but made it clear that they don’t approve commencement speeches beforehand.
The university’s official write-up of the ceremony conspicuously omitted any mention of cryptocurrency, focusing instead on Pan’s message of civility and social responsibility.

Bitcoin is now trading at $64.192. Chart: TradingView
Psychedelic Inspiration Or Publicity Stunt?
Pan’s use of ayahuasca to craft the speech added another layer of eccentricity to the situation. While some might dismiss it as a publicity stunt, others wondered about the impact of such mind-altering substances on the speech’s content.
Unorthodox Methods, Unconventional Message
Regardless of the inspiration, Pan’s core message about overcoming fear and embracing new mindsets resonated with some. He highlighted common barriers to investing – fear, laziness, and closed-mindedness – urging graduates to break free from these limitations.

Pan’s Diverse Background
Pan’s biography offers a glimpse into his unconventional approach. A self-described “social entrepreneur, musician, and inspirational speaker,” his career path has spanned prestigious firms like McKinsey & Company and PepsiCo, along with stints at Facebook and his current venture, MyIntent, a company that creates custom-message bracelets. This eclectic background might explain his willingness to break the mold with his commencement speech.
Lingering Questions
The fallout from Pan’s speech continues. Whether his use of ayahuasca was a genuine creative outlet or a publicity stunt remains unclear. The university’s attempt to distance itself from the Bitcoin promotion raises questions about the control they have over commencement speeches.
Ultimately, Chris Pan’s unorthodox commencement speech will likely be remembered more for the controversy it sparked than for any pearls of wisdom it offered.

QANplatform launches world’s first quantum-resistant, EVM-compatible testnet

QANplatform launched the world’s first quantum-resistant blockchain testnet compatible with the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM), enabling the development of quantum-resistant smart contracts.The new testnet will enable developers to write smart contracts using any programming language, according to QANplatform’s announcement shared with Cointelegraph.This marks the first EVM-compatible testnet with quantum-resistant cybersecurity, according to Johann Polecsak, co-founder and CTO of QANplatform, who told Cointelegraph:“Centralized authorities like governments, companies, and organizations can switch their IT security to post-quantum cryptography much more easily than blockchain platforms.”Post-quantum security has become a pressing concern since December 2023, when the second-largest quantum processor, IBM Condor, was launched with 1,121 qubits.Due to their inherent decentralization, most of the top existing blockchain networks like Bitcoin, Ethereum, or Solana are unable to adopt quantum-resistant security measures without significant negative impact, explained Polecsak:“Pseudonymity of blockchain will backfire at post-quantum migration because it will be impossible to tell legitimate owners migrating their funds and data or hackers stealing all of it apart. In this case, billions of dollars worth of “free money” and data could land in hackers’ hands if they start migrating on the real owners’ behalf making the affected blockchains immediately worthless.”However, the new QANplatform testnet will enable EVM-compatible protocols to test their migration process for a quantum-resistant alternative, without risking user funds on the mainnet.The testnet announcement comes nearly two months after the first European country adopted QANplatform’s quantum-resistant technology in March. The tech stack protects against quantum computing attacks on government-owned cybersecurity infrastructure.Related: Robinhood crypto business slapped with SEC Wells noticeQuantum security is already a significant concern in 2024Governments worldwide are already preparing for a post-quantum era. In 2018, the European Commission launched the Quantum Flagship research initiative with a budget of at least 1 billion euros ($1.078 billion) and a duration of 10 years.These efforts are justified, considering that quantum computing is already presenting a significant security threat for everyday internet users, according to QANplatform’s Polecsak. He said:“Quantum-resistant technology is important already today because of the ‘Store now, decrypt later' cybersecurity threat that involves attackers collecting encrypted data with the intention of decrypting it later using more powerful computing methods, such as quantum computers.”Large companies are also gearing up for a post-quantum future. Apple unveiled a new update in February that aims to future-proof iMessages with post-quantum cryptography, making Apple the first among a handful of quantum-proof messaging providers. Signal messaging app also launched a “quantum-resistant” encryption upgrade in September 2023, but Apple says it’s the first to reach “level 3” encryption.While quantum computers may take more time to develop, post-quantum security needs to be ahead of the curve, as quantum computers with stable qubits will be able to break today’s main cybersecurity algorithms, according to Polecsak:“Today’s asymmetric cryptographic algorithms like RSA and EC used by the whole internet – including governments, banks, email providers, social media, blockchain platforms, etc — will be cracked by quantum computers.”Related: Crypto options desk QCP Capital wins Abu Dhabi license: Report

Big Rally Expectation for This Altcoin from Franklin Templeton, Who Manages 1.5 Trillion Dollars! "He'll be in the top three!" - Bitcoin Sistemi

Solana (SOL), which suffered a major collapse after FTX's bankruptcy in November 2022, but rose from its ashes again in 2023, has recorded a record increase of over 1500% since January 2023.
SOL, which rose from approximately 9.7 dollars to 157 dollars, rose to over 200 dollars in March.


While Solana has made a name for itself thanks to its successful performance, global investment giant Franklin Templeton, which manages 1.5 trillion dollars, claimed that Solana is ready to become the third largest cryptocurrency after Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH).
A recent report by Franklin Templeton analysts stated that the Solana network experienced significant growth in total fees and decentralized exchange (DEX) volumes last year.





Analysts expect the growth in the Solana network to continue and stated that the Solana network is durable despite the problems experienced in the network.
Stating that the durability of the Solana network, as well as the ongoing airdrops and the success of SOL-based mem tokens, have a positive impact on the SOL price, analysts pointed out that SOL has a strong chance to be among the top three cryptocurrencies.



“Cryptocurrency enthusiasts are wondering what the next big thing in crypto could be. While we don't know the exact answer, we think there's a strong chance it could happen in Solana.
Because the Solana network has proven how strong it is with its durability, ongoing airdrops, mem token success and resurgence.
That's why we believe Solana has the potential to become the third largest cryptocurrency on the market.”

2 cryptocurrencies to reach $5 billion market cap in May


Following Bitcoin’s (BTC) recent drop to $61,000, the cryptocurrency market is alive with speculation and excitement about a potential altcoin season. Analysts are forecasting a significant upturn in altcoin valuations, driven by Bitcoin’s price movements and broader market dynamics.
As Bitcoin stabilizes, the spotlight shifts to a diverse array of altcoins poised to lead the next market cycle. The expanding role of decentralized finance (DeFi), continuous improvements in blockchain scalability, and the increasing use of smart contracts are key factors expected to fuel a significant altcoin rally.
This surge is anticipated to push several altcoins beyond the $5 billion market cap mark, signifying a major milestone in their valuation and influence within the broader cryptocurrency landscape.


Finbold has highlighted two cryptocurrencies that are likely to surpass this threshold. These assets are nearing the milestone, with their trajectory dependent on the continuation of the bull run and factors like supply inflation. High supply inflation could increase their market cap even if their prices remain unchanged.
Render (RNDR)
Render (RNDR) has recently reclaimed a critical price level, now trading at $10.51, closely watched by market experts. After hitting a low of $7, Render has rallied impressively, marking a 33% increase over the week and displaying strong bullish momentum. Currently, its market cap stands at $4.15 billion.

The token has seen a rapid ascent, reflecting growing investor confidence. Analysts, including notable figures in the cryptocurrency community, suggest that Render could reach new all-time highs, potentially hitting $200 in this market cycle. This optimism is fueled by upcoming AI-related events and the increasing adoption of AI technologies, which could further boost interest and investment in AI-focused tokens like RNDR.
Hedera (HBAR)
Hedera (HBAR) has established itself with its Hashgraph consensus technology, offering faster transaction speeds and enhanced security compared to traditional blockchain systems. Hedera recently celebrated processing over 50 billion transactions, demonstrating its capability and the growing trust in its platform.
Hedera price and market cap. Source: CoinMarketCap
Partnerships with Shinhan Bank for facilitating stablecoin remittances using Hedera’s technology, underscore its practical application in mainstream finance. The bank leverages Hedera’s network for real-time settlement and FX rate integration, showcasing Hedera’s potential to transform financial services. The current market cap of HBAR is $3.97 billion, with the token trading at $0.111 and posting a weekly gain of 8%.
Both Render and Hedera are capitalizing on the broader crypto market’s recovery, with increasing investor interest and bullish trends. Render’s unique position in the digital content creation market and Hedera’s advancements in enterprise blockchain solutions set them apart as leaders in their respective fields. 
As these platforms continue to innovate and expand their use cases, achieving a $5 billion market cap seems increasingly likely. It’s worth noting that despite being supported by several fundamentals, the possibility of the highlighted cryptocurrencies reaching the $5 billion mark will largely depend on whether the market maintains a bullish momentum.

In the dynamic world of cryptocurrency investment, Ethereum (ETH) has recently made headlines by breaking its seven-week streak of outflows, welcoming a substantial influx of $30 million. This significant shift in investor sentiment marks a potential turning point for the popular digital asset.According to a recent report by CoinShares, a leading digital asset investment firm, the overall landscape of digital asset investment products witnessed outflows for the fourth consecutive week, amounting to a total of $251 million. Notably, this week's outflows included Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs) in the United States, which saw $156 million flowing out.Analysts speculate that the recent price decline of Bitcoin, dipping 10% below the average purchase price of these ETFs, might have triggered automatic sell orders, contributing to the outflow trend. While the bulk of outflows originated from the United States, amounting to $504 million, other regions such as Canada, Switzerland and Germany, also experienced outflows, totaling $9.6 million, $9.8 million and $7.3 million, respectively.Ethereum ETFs show dominanceAmid this outflow trend on the market, a notable exception emerged in the form of Hong Kong's successful launch of spot-based Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs. The debut of these ETFs saw an impressive $307 million in inflows during their first week of trading, indicating robust demand from investors in the region.Bitcoin remained a focal point for investors, witnessing outflows amounting to $284 million. Interestingly, Ethereum stood out by attracting $30 million in inflows, breaking its prolonged streak of outflows. Moreover, several alternative cryptocurrencies, or altcoins, also experienced inflows during the same period. Among them, Avalanche, Cardano and Polkadot emerged as the most significant beneficiaries, attracting $0.5 million, $0.4 million and $0.3 million, respectively.This shift in investment patterns suggests a nuanced evolution within the market. While Bitcoin continues to dominate investor attention, Ethereum's resurgence and the growing interest in altcoins indicate a diversification trend among traders. Moreover, the successful introduction of ETFs in new markets like Hong Kong underscores the global expansion and maturation of investment avenues.

Trader Names One Altcoin As ‘AI Bet’ for 2024, Updates Outlook on Two Additional Crypto Assets - The Daily Hodl


								A popular crypto trader says he’s long-term bullish on an artificial intelligence (AI)-related altcoin even though its chart is flashing some potential warning signs.
The pseudonymous crypto analyst known as Altcoin Sherpa tells his 215,900 followers on the social media platform X that Render (RNDR) is his top AI pick for this market cycle.










“Going to have this as one of my AI bets for this cycle and throw it into a cold wallet and hold most of it.”
Source: Altcoin Sherpa/X
Render aims to provide close to real-time rendering by leveraging its network of decentralized Graphics Processing Units (GPUs).
Explains the project’s website,
“On top of a decentralized GPU computing network, Render provides a platform for artists and developers to build services and applications for the emerging digital economy, including next-generation digital rights management (DRM), artificial intelligence (AI), and virtual assets [non-fungible tokens].”
RNDR, the project’s native token, is trading at $10.21 at time of writing.
Altcoin Sherpa is also interested in Bittensor (TAO), a decentralized blockchain platform that focuses on machine learning and AI. But the trader acknowledges that the asset’s chart looks “scary” right now.
“Do I want to make this one of my high-conviction AI bets for 2024? It’s a decent place to buy with the 200-day exponential moving average (EMA) plus 0.50 Fibonacci. I think I’m going to go half size here and more at the .618 fib at $300ish.”
Source: Altcoin Sherpa/X
TAO is trading at $451.47 at time of writing. The 44th-ranked crypto asset by market cap is down nearly 4% in the past 24 hours.
Altcoin Sherpa says he’s less bullish on Wormhole (W), a cross-chain messaging protocol. According to the trader, W’s move above its resistance at $0.72 looks like a fakeout rally that could send prices tumbling to $0.587.
“Looks like the recent move was just a deviation, this is going back in the range. I’m going to probably cut this now/soon and take profit. Happy to buy back higher later though on the true break.”
Source: Altcoin Sherpa/X
At time of writing, W is worth $0.658.

Crypto 'An Outsized Piece Of The Scams And Problems' In Markets: Gary Gensler - Coinbase Glb (NASDAQ:COIN) - Benzinga

Pointing out the disproportionate amount of fraud and scams within the relatively small crypto sector compared to its size in the broader market, SEC chair Gary Gensler on Tuesday highlighted the agency's focus amid the market’s rapid expansion.What Happened: “We are seeing a $10 trillion capital market,” Gensler noted, clarifying that “Crypto is a small piece of our markets but it’s an outsized piece of the scams and frauds and problems in our markets.”In an interview with CNBC, he stressed that without adequate regulatory frameworks, these issues are likely to persist, emphasizing the necessity for robust oversight.Gensler's remarks reflect ongoing concerns about the compliance of various crypto tokens with existing securities laws. He pointed out, “Much of this field is noncompliant with the protections of our securities laws,” which contributes to a higher ratio of issues relative to its market size.During the interview, Gensler addressed the recent actions taken by the SEC, including a live litigation case against Coinbase COIN, which he referenced to illustrate the SEC’s role as the “cop on the beat.”He said, “We have a really important responsibility… ensuring that people that are asking you to put your money into buy or sell securities are following the law.”The discussion also touched on the broader implications of these regulatory measures for everyday investors, particularly those using platforms like Robinhood HOOD. Also Read: $130B Asset Manager Hightower Makes Splash With $68M Spot Bitcoin ETF PurchaseGensler advised caution, reminding viewers that many crypto tokens might be considered securities under laws as interpreted by the U.S. Supreme Court, thus requiring proper disclosures which are currently lacking.A focal point of the crypto discussion centered on whether Ethereum could be classified as a commodity or a security, which would significantly impact the potential for an Ethereum ETH/USD-based ETF. Gensler did not provide a definitive answer but reiterated his commitment to investor protection, “The fundamental question is how do we ensure that the American investor is protected?”What’s Next: This ongoing regulatory focus is timely as the financial community looks forward to Benzinga’s Future of Digital Assets event on Nov. 19.The event is set to delve into these very issues, exploring the impact of regulatory decisions on the future landscape of digital assets. Insights from leaders like Gensler will be crucial for attendees seeking to navigate the complexities of investing in cryptocurrencies amid evolving regulatory frameworks.Read Next: Bitcoin Spot ETFs Register $217M Net Inflows On MondayImage: Shutterstock

QCP Capital Secures Initial Approval to Enter Abu Dhabi Market - DailyCoin


        
QCP Capital is keen to tap a new market.



The company got preliminary approval to operate in the market.



QCP is the first Singapore-based crypto firm to secure such approval.
Crypto options desk QCP Capital said Tuesday it was the latest digital assets firm to expand into the Middle East following preliminary approval to operate in Abu Dhabi.Founded in 2017, QCP Capital is a Singapore-based crypto market maker and broker, with nearly $60 billion in derivatives trading volume last year. The company’s initial approval to enter the Middle East follows a recent partnership with Abu Dhabi-based Further Ventures to develop new products in digital assets.QCP Capital Enters Abu DhabiAccording to a May 7 statement seen by Bloomberg, the Financial Services Regulatory Authority (FSRA) of Abu Dhabi Global Market (ADGM) has granted QCP Capital in-principal authorization to “conduct regulated activities.”
Besides its plan to develop new crypto-based products in collaboration with Further Ventures, QCP Capital intends to focus on core businesses such as trading and market-making once the company receives a full license to operate in the region.QCP CEO Melvin Deng lauded the win, noting that Abu Dhabi had progressive regulators who considered crypto “a complete ecosystem with all of traditional finance.” The CEO further praised Abu Dhabi’s favorable geographical location.“The Middle East is actually quite a good confluence for capital flows from Europe, to the Middle East region, as well as Asia.” Deng stated. “So it’s got similar properties to what we have in Singapore, and we want to leverage on their capabilities to establish another marketplace.”With the initial approval, QCP Capital joins other prominent crypto companies in the Middle East, including Binance, OKX, and Nomura’s Laser Digital. The company plans to relocate some of its over 70 employees to Abu Dhabi once it scores a full operational license.

Galaxis: expansion of the use of NFTs beyond digital art

Galaxis, a post-hype NFT platform, has secured $10 million in funding prior to the launch of its token. Among the investors are well-known names such as Chainlink, Ethereum Name Services (ENS), and Rarestone Capital.
Let’s see below all the details. 

Galaxis aims to expand the use of NFTs beyond digital art
As anticipated, Galaxis, a Web3 platform based in Singapore, has raised $10 million in funding for the launch of its token. 
Among the main investors are Chainlink, Ethereum Name Services (ENS), Rarestone Capital, Taisu Ventures, and Nick Johnson, co-founder of ENS.
Part of the funding also came from the sale of over 11,000 “Galaxis engines”, which contributed to the total amount raised. Galaxis is a platform that helps creators and brands launch collections of non-fungible tokens (NFTs). 
Among its collaborators there are celebrities like DJ Steve Aoki, actor Val Kilmer, and NBA star LaMelo Ball. In the last two years, Galaxis has sold over 225,000 NFTs, generating more than 32,000 ETH (approximately 100 million dollars) in secondary NFT sales. 
Now, the platform is planning for “mass distribution,” the company stated.
The CEO and co-founder Andras Kristof, who installed the first Bitcoin ATMs in Singapore, stated that the next step for the company will be to see their native token GALAXIS powering the ecosystem.
As a post-hype NFT utility platform, Kristof argues that NFT technology will have real value beyond the hype, extending to various sectors beyond Web3.
Galaxis, incubated by CoinMarketCap, allows individuals and brands with communities to create engagement and reward mechanisms through NFTs, without the need for third-party tools. Thus creating an integrated economy for community management.
Bybit announces Galaxis IDO: a fundraising campaign through decentralized exchanges
Bybit, one of the leading cryptocurrency exchanges in the world, has announced that it will host an Initial DEX Offering (IDO) for Galaxis on its Web3 platform.
An IDO, or Initial DEX Offering, is a fundraising method that uses decentralized exchanges, allowing investors to purchase new tokens through liquidity pools. 
Unlike an ICO, the IDO does not involve centralized exchanges, offering greater decentralization.
Bybit has declared that the subscription period for the IDO started on May 3rd and will end on May 7th. Subsequently, there will be a three-day interval before the presentation, purchase, and listing of the token, which will start on May 10th. 
The token will have the symbol “GALAXIS” and the total supply will be limited to ten billion units. To participate, users must own a Bybit wallet with at least 300 USDC on the Ethereum blockchain. 
The IDO will have a maximum of 2,000 winners and secondary accounts will not be allowed. Once the tokens are received, participants will be able to redeem them, but they will be responsible for paying the gas fees  blockchain.
Emily Bao, Bybit Web evangelist, commented that the vision of Galaxis is in line with Bybit’s philosophy, which aims to support innovative Web3 projects. 
Bao added that Bybit is committed to promoting a more connected, open, and fair Web3 ecosystem, and that the Galaxis project is an important step towards this vision.

CNBC has reported that billionaire and renowned investor Stanley Druckenmiller has slightly backed out of his bet on Nvidia chip making giant and radically decreased his stake in the company.Druckenmiller said during his visit with CNBC’s “Squawk Box” show that he expects artificial intelligence to be overdone in the short term as an investment tool. Druckenmiller takes break from Nvidia and AIThe billionaire admitted that he reduced his Nvidia stake in March because he needs a break.In particular, the investor decreased his Nvidia stake after the share price jumped from $150 to $900. Druckenmiller stated that he does not plan to act like Warren Buffett and “own things for 10 or 20 years.”Over the past few years, Nvidia has been focused on large artificial intelligence models created by its graphics processors for servers. In 2023, Nvidia’s stock did very well and was one of the best in the market by performance; it skyrocketed a staggering 238%. This year already, Nvidia shares rallied by 66%.Initially, Druckenmiller noticed Nvidia, when he was introduced to by a partner at Duquesne Family Office, who thought that AI was going to beat blockchain in the long run.A month after the billionaire bought a stake in it, OpenAI released ChatGPT for public use and then he increased his position at Nvidia. Still, even though he reckons that AI may be overhyped in the short run, Druckenmiller remains bullish on it in the long term.“So AI might be a little overhyped now, but underhyped long term,” he said, likening AI to the internet in its earliest stages. He expects a big payoff to happen four or five years from now.Elon Musk issues crucial AI warningAs reported by U.Today earlier, tech magnate Elon Musk, founder of the xAI start-up that produce the Grok AI chatbot, stated the other day during a public talk that he believes it is vitally important to train AI in the right way so it can be human-friendly and will foster cooperation with mankind in the future.To do this, Musk believes, it is necessary to train AI to be truth-seeking and as curious as possible. Otherwise it may become hostile toward humans.

Trader Who Made 'Giga Wealth' On Memes Reveals 'Mememillions Playbook,' Still Holds Most Of His DOGE - Benzinga

Pseudonymous self-styled “meme coin millionaire” Apatheticwhale revealed his "playbook” to make millions in meme coins,  stating that this is the most alpha he has ever posted.What Happened: Apatheticwhale suggested that although it takes time, traders should create numerous aged Ethereum ETH/USD and Solana SOL/USD accounts that appear to be owned by real individuals and are not connected. He then advises to "accumulate 2-4% of the supply of several projects that have energy behind them, in small amounts across each address."His strategy is to not hold more than $250,000 in value in one address and wait until one or several go to billions.  When it is time to sell, he recommends selling on centralized exchanges and not decentralized exchanges."It’s really that easy. no need to run around in circles buying tickers of your favorite influencer on here," Apatheticwhale concludes.Also Read: These Two Meme Coins Will Hit A ‘$10B Valuation By Summer,’ Crypto Trader PredictsWhy It Matters: Apatheticwhale claimed that this strategy has worked for him with cryptocurrencies like Shiba Inu SHIB/USD, Pepe PEPE/USD, BabyDoge and others. He also revealed that he mined Dogecoin DOGE/USD in its early days and still holds most of it.Apatheticwhale’s "playbook" offers a simple yet potentially effective strategy for achieving significant gains in the crypto space. By creating numerous aged accounts, accumulating promising projects, and exercising patience, the trader suggests that investors can position themselves for success.Responding to an X user who asked if there are opportunities to do this all the time, apatheticwhale states that if one purchases random coins like the flavor of the week it is hard. However, buying projects that have people working behind them will take you to billions.What’s Next: The influence of meme coins Bitcoin as an institutional asset class is expected to be thoroughly explored at Benzinga’s upcoming Future of Digital Assets event on Nov. 19.Read Next: Dogecoin Sprints Off With Meme Cousins Over The Weekend: Here Are 4 Cryptos Trading With 10%+ GainsImage: ShutterstockThis content was partially produced with the help of AI tools and was reviewed and published by Benzinga editors.

Palantir Stock Plunges After Revised Guidance Falls Short of Forecasts - Tokenist


					
Neither the author, Tim Fries, nor this website, The Tokenist, provide financial advice. Please consult our website policy prior to making financial decisions.



Palantir Technologies Inc. (NYSE: PLTR), a leading data analytics company, announced its first-quarter 2024 earnings on Monday, May 6. The company reported revenue of $634 million, a 21% increase compared to the same quarter last year, and earnings per share (EPS) of 8 cents, which met analyst expectations. Palantir also achieved a net income of $105.5 million, representing a 17% rise from the previous year.



However, the stock fell after its guidance was lower than expected. At the time of writing, Palantir was trading at $21.66, down 14.09% from the market open.



Palantir Reports Segment Revenue and Customer Growth



The company’s revenue growth was driven by strong performance in both its commercial and government segments. Commercial revenue grew by 27% to $299 million, while government revenue increased by 16% to $335 million, with the U.S. government contributing $257 million to the total government revenue. Palantir also saw a 42% jump in customers compared to the same quarter last year, indicating a growing demand for its data analytics solutions.





Palantir Ups Guidance, But It’s Not Enough 



Despite the positive earnings, Palantir’s full-year revenue forecast fell short of analyst expectations. The company raised its full-year revenue guidance to between $2.68 billion and $2.69 billion, up from its previous estimate of $2.65 billion to $2.67 billion. However, this was below the consensus estimate of $2.71 billion. Palantir also expects its adjusted operating income to be between $868 million and $880 million for the full year. For the second quarter, the company anticipates revenue to be between $649 million and $653 million, with adjusted income from operations guided between $209 million and $213 million.



PLTR Plunges After Guidance Announcement



Following the earnings announcement, Palantir’s stock price fell over 6% in extended trading as the company’s guidance failed to meet investor expectations. As of May 7, 2024, at the time of writing, Palantir’s stock price was $21.66, down 14.09% following the earnings announcement, despite a year-to-date return of +26.12%. Analysts, such as those from Goldman Sachs (NYSE: GS), expressed concerns about the sustainability of Palantir’s U.S. commercial growth and its ability to maintain or accelerate its revenue growth.

Unstoppable Domains and Women in Tech launch world's first Web3 domain for women at 2024 global summit - Crypto Briefing




Silicon Valley institution Women in Tech (WIT) has teamed up with Unstoppable Domains, the leading Web3 domain entity, to launch the world’s first Web3 domain for women at the 2024 Women in Tech Global Summit, according to a recent press release shared by Women in Tech.Each year, a diverse group of leaders from government, business, and civil society join forces at the Women in Tech Global Summit to discuss women’s current status in the technological landscape and set priorities for the forthcoming year. The 2024 edition takes place in Paris on May 6-7 under the High Patronage of President Emmanuel Macron.As part of the launch, the Women in Tech Global Summit will feature its own Web3 top-level domain (TLD) named “.WITG,” aiming to enhance the event’s digital community and support initiatives for female tech leaders.As noted, each delegate at the summit can log in using a unique digital identity in the format “Name.WITG”. This allows access to a community platform for networking and educational resources, focusing on topics like blockchain and artificial intelligence.In addition, the “.WITG” domain will help Women in Tech enhance its global brand and allow community members to become ambassadors. According to the WIT team, the newly launched domain is also part of a broader strategy to empower women through technology, providing tools for success in the digital realm and promoting personal and professional growth.Ayumi Moore Aoki, Founder and CEO of the Women in Tech Global Summit, expressed the organization’s ongoing commitment to uniting leaders and fostering discussions on global challenges facing women.
“Women in Tech is now firmly established as the global brand for the empowerment of women in our industry, but we can’t rest on our laurels. Thanks to our new partnership with Unstoppable Domains, the 2024 Summit will bring together leaders from government, business, and civil society in a single secure, digital space to discuss the challenges facing women worldwide,” Aoki stated.
They can then access education and training in transformational technologies like blockchain and AI and collaborate to build a better future for women—in the tech space and far beyond,” she added.
Sandy Carter, COO of Unstoppable Domains, believes Web3 domains are a powerful tool for security and fostering positive online communities and interactions.
“The rise of deepfakes and AI-powered malware has made digital identity one of the hottest issues in technology and politics, but web3 domains are about more than combating bad actors,” said Carter. “The genius of Web3 is how it can be harnessed to build and foster new communities, bringing a new era in how organizations engage and interact with their audience.”
As a leading provider of Web3 domain names and digital identity, Unstoppable Domains has previously provided similar services for other high-profile tech events, including helping Austin, Texas, secure a blockchain-powered Web3 domain.In collaboration with Unstoppable Domains, Women in Tech Global plans to apply for a branded Web2 generic top-level domain (gTLD) with ICANN. The team aims to secure the “.WIT” gTLD in 2026 to further enhance its digital presence and community engagement, all geared towards empowering women in the technology sector.

Bitcoin HODLer Profit-Taking Exhausts: Green Sign For Rally?


								On-chain data shows the Bitcoin long-term holders have finally cooled off their profit-taking after showing a wild selloff just earlier.
Bitcoin Coin Days Destroyed Has Calmed Down For BTC Recently
As pointed out by BTC on-chain research account “The Bitcoin Researcher” in a post on X, the Coin Days Destroyed In Profit metric has declined recently. A “coin day” is a quantity that 1 BTC accumulates after staying dormant on the blockchain for 1 day. Thus, when a coin sits still in the same address for a while, it carries some number of coin days.

When a coin like this is finally moved on the network, its coin days count resets back to zero, and the coin days that it had been holding are said to be “destroyed.” The Coin Days Destroyed (CDD) keeps track of the total amount of coin days being destroyed in this manner across the blockchain on any given day. When the value of this indicator spikes, it means that a large number of aged coins are on the move.
These spikes are attributed to the “long-term holders,” investors who normally tend to HODL onto their coins for extended periods. This group holds large coin days, so their moves end up leading to a destruction of a large amount of them.
Large moves from these investors, though, are not that common, as they are by nature HODLers who remain tight despite whatever may be going on in the wider market. When the LTHs do break their dormancy, it’s generally for selling, so spikes in the CDD may correspond to selling pressure arising from this group.
In the context of the current topic, profit-taking from these investors specifically is of interest, so the analyst has cited the CDD data for only the coins that were carrying a profit prior to the move.
Here is the chart for this Bitcoin indicator over the last few years:

The value of the metric appears to have registered a drawdown in recent weeks | Source: @ResearchBTCNow on X
As displayed in the above graph, the Bitcoin CDD In Profit had risen to some very high levels earlier as the BTC rally towards the new all-time high had taken place.
This extraordinary spike would suggest that the run had enticed even these diamond hands into harvesting their profits. As the asset’s drawdown post this rally has played out, though, the metric’s value has declined, suggesting a decrease in selling pressure from the LTHs.

The ‘CDD In Profit’ has now come down to relatively low levels, although its value is still higher than during the bear market. Given this trend, it’s possible that the LTH profit-taking may have been exhausted for now, or at least is close to being so.
It now remains to be seen how the Bitcoin price develops from here, as perhaps one of the main obstacles to the rally is now out of the asset’s way.

PEPE Whales Move $21 Million Worth Of Coins - Here Are The Destinations


                            On-chain data shows PEPE whales have moved large amounts of the memecoin during the past day. Here’s where these tokens have been heading.
PEPE Whales Have Been Active On The Network Today
According to data from the cryptocurrency transaction tracker service Whale Alert, two large PEPE transactions have occurred in the space of a few hours during the past day. Both of these moves are of a scale that’s typically associated to the whales, humongous entities that can carry some influence in the market thanks to their ability to make such large transfers.

Because of their position on the network, their moves can be worth watching, as they may end up reflecting on the price of the cryptocurrency. As for how exactly the asset may be impacted by the transfers of these investors can come down to what they intended to achieve with the moves.
It can be hard to say about any exact motive, but the details of the transactions on the blockhain can sometimes provide hints about the context surrounding it.
Below are the details of the first PEPE whale transfer from the past day:

Looks like this massive transfer on the Ethereum blockchain took a fee of just $1.14 to go through | Source: Whale Alert
As is visible, the sending address in the case of this PEPE whale transaction was an unknown wallet, meaning that it was unattached to any known centralized platform like an exchange. Such wallets are usually the investors’ personal, self-custodial addresses.
The receiving address, on the other hand, does have a platform affiliated to it: the cryptocurrency exchange Binance. Thus, it would appear that the whale moved 1,238,332,920,144 PEPE (worth over $10.5 million at the time the transfer went through) from their personal wallet to the custody of the exchange.
Transfers of this type are known as exchange inflows. The investors make exchange inflows whenever they want to make use of one of the services that these platforms provide, which can include selling. As such, exchange inflows can end up being bearish for the price.
If the whale, in the current case, indeed made the deposit to sell, then PEPE could naturally be negatively impacted, given the large scale of the transaction. Fortunately for the investors of the meme coin, though, the second transaction from today is actually the exact opposite of this transfer; it’s an exchange outflow.

As displayed above, this PEPE whale moved coins from Binance to an unknown wallet through this transaction. Investors generally transfer to personal addresses when they plan to hold in the long term, as it’s safer to do so outside the custody of central entities. Thus, it’s possible this whale plans to HODL these coins.
Interestingly, the amount involved in this move, 1,241,850,000,000 PEPE ($10.5 million), is quite similar to the exchange inflow. Given that the same exchange is also involved in both, it’s possible that the same whale may in fact be responsible for the both of them.

Though, since the addresses don’t quite match, it’s still uncertain. Either way, the fact that an equal-sized exchange outflow has occurred mere hours after should be able to balance out any bearish effects arising out of the inflow, at least in theory.
PEPE Price
At the time of writing, PEPE is floating around the $0.000008445479 mark, up more than 21% over the past week.

Flying Pepe (FLYPEPE) to Surge 6,800% Ahead of MEXC Listing, as Bonk and Dogecoin Lag



                    

Flying Pepe (FLYPEPE) could turn early investors into multi-millionaires if it becomes a mainstream coin, like Bonk (BONK) and Dogecoin (DOGE).



Flying Pepe (FLYPEPE), a new Solana memecoin that was launched this week, is poised to explode over 6,800% in price in the coming days.




This is because FLYPEPE has announced its first centralized exchange listing, which will be on MEXC.



This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up.



Currently, Flying Pepe can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jupiter and Raydium, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days.




Early investors in BONK and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Flying Pepe could become the next viral memecoin.



To buy Flying Pepe on Raydium or Jupiter ahead of the MEXC listing, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Flying Pepe by entering its contract address – 65orYrJbQxa5BZUWyeCsDtJC7JZg8zQYcvRZpvnnd5eq – in the receiving field.



In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Bonk (BONK) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price.



If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner.




The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Bonk (BONK), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum.



This is why many BONK, DOGE, and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like FLYPEPE.

EU crypto regulations undermined by lack of enforcement, say observers

The European Union’s flagship crypto legislation, passed in 2023, is coming into effect this year, but pre-existing legislation has not been enforced evenly.This is according to Jon Helgi Egilsson, chair and founder of Monerium, a licensed e-money issuer operating in the region.According to Egilsson, the new regulations — the Markets in Crypto-Assets Regulation (MiCA) — are built upon the EU’s Electronic Money Directive (EMD II), which has been flouted for years. Egilsson expressed dismay at the general state of enforcement and how it impacts e-money firms in the region.“If you issue e-money, you have to be licensed as an e-money institution,” Egilsson said. “If you don’t, then you’re subject to fines and jail time.”This is the situation as Egilsson reads it, but as he explained, not everyone faces the same level of scrutiny.“We are competing with companies both in Europe and outside of Europe, which are doing similar things, but they haven’t received any license.”While that might be enough to concern e-money issuers, in some ways, becoming licensed only creates additional problems.Egilsson said, “As a licensed entity, you are restricted, what you can do, how you can promote it, how you can solicit it [...] You have to submit reports, and then the regulator comes back and says, ‘You’re not doing this.’”Recent: Bitcoin L2s set to explode as Runes congest BTC networkTherefore, becoming a licensed issuer with regulatory oversight involves “a lot of overhead and cost.”But while Monerium operates under close regulatory scrutiny, other forms of money, including stablecoins, do not.“I think it’s remarkable that regulators somehow allow this to happen and have been allowing this for years now,” said a clearly unhappy Egilsson.A disparity in enforcementCointelegraph spoke with Natalia Latka, policy director and regulatory affairs at blockchain analysis firm Merkle Science, to understand why this disparity in enforcement has emerged.Latka explained that in the EU “there are two main divergent legal viewpoints” surrounding the regulation of electronic money tokens (EMTs) or stablecoins.The first school of thought focuses on the predominance of the Electronic Money Directive.As Latka says, “According to this school, the EMD directly applied to EMTs before MiCA was enacted, making MiCA a regulation that does not introduce completely new rules but rather reinforces and elaborates upon the existing framework established by the EMD.”Latka said that this view finds support in Article 48(2) of MiCA, “which explicitly states that e-money tokens shall be considered as electronic money, confirming the application of the EMD to EMTs.”However, an alternative school of thought within the EU appears to have informed regulators’ approach.MiCA is kingThe second school of thought believes MiCA is the primary legislation for stablecoins or EMTs.“Supporters of this school emphasize the significant differences between EMTs and traditional electronic money,” said Latka.As regulators see it, stablecoins create additional risk factors that are not present in e-money. Self-custodial wallets create one such systematic risk factor.Another risk factor emerges from global stablecoins that could become systemic. The European Commission considered the EMD’s provisions unsuitable for tackling the inherent risks of such a scenario.Latka said, “It’s important to note that while the commission could have regulated e-money tokens under the EMD, this option was discussed but ultimately not pursued. Instead, the decision was made to create a bespoke regulatory framework that coexists with the EMD to address all regulatory gaps effectively.”The issue for industry insiders such as Egilsson is that while this new regulatory framework was discussed, debated, approved and enacted, there has not been parity of enforcement.Given the issues Egilsson raised, Cointelegraph asked if MiCA would make a difference.“I sincerely believe they will enforce it,” Egilsson said.An open questionWith MiCA coming fully into force later in 2024 and concerned parties such as Egilsson optimistic about its effect, it might appear that the legal debate on stablecoins and e-money is over.Recent: Where to store your crypto: Wallets provide diverse options for holdersHowever, MiCA only represents the next step in an ongoing discussion. Far more detail needs to be worked out, which could take years.“There isn’t a definitive answer to this debate, and it is essential that the EU authorities provide clear guidance,” said Latka. “The industry needs additional clarifications, especially regarding how MiCA interacts with existing EU financial regulations and directives. The interplay of MiCA with other financial laws requires a well-defined demarcation and a strategy for resolving any conflicting or overlapping regulations.”

Solana (SOL) is fighting for survival in a visibly tense market. The drawdown in the market has suppressed SOL from breaking away from its psychologically important level of $160. At the time of writing, data from CoinMarketCap pegs the price of Solana at $155.53.Solana whale FUD not going awaySolana has long been associated with whales moving large amounts of SOL in and out of exchanges. Notably, investors and retail traders do not know when the next major dumping will take place. This has generally kept Solana on the edge as HODLers do not want to get caught up in the mix.According to recent data from crypto analytics provider Whale Alert, an unknown Solana whale moved 260,931 SOL worth approximately $40,502,770 from an unknown wallet to Kraken Exchange. This sort of whale movement is often indicative of a sell-off. While it remains unknown whether or not this whale is planning a sell-off, the current market sentiment is bearish and might weaken investors' resolve to keep betting on SOL. This shaky sentiment is playing out in the price of the coin. From a year-to-date (YTD) high of $209.7, Solana has retracted to its current level after dropping as low as $119 earlier this month.Defeating bearsSolana is on the watchlist of many traders, and the push to grow might not set in if the bearish whale transaction push does not die down in the near term.Solana is already free from the influence of the FTX Derivatives Exchange implosion. With the trading platform owning a large stack of Solana, its successive auctions have alleviated concerns over price instability in the long term. Solana has also launched a major upgrade on the mainnet to combat the negative impact of network congestion. In all, Solana is prime to build on the more than 590% surge it has recorded over the past year.

Worldcoin is pumping on rumors that ChatGPT is launching a search engine.
                        Worldcoin ($WLD), the biometric crypto project helmed by OpenAI CEO Sam Altman, has shot up a blistering 37% in the last seven to trade at $6.17 as of this writing.A rumor that ChatGPT, OpenAI’s main offering, is launching a search engine next week spurred much of  Worldcoin’s rally over the last few days.The main source of the rumor is the fact that a domain called search.ChatGPT.com now exists, although AI influencer and researcher Pete Huang believes it could drop on May 9, ahead of Google’s big conference, according to a social media post.According to Worldcoin’s trading chart, the market’s early March rally drove $WLD to set a new all-time high of $11.74 on March 10, although today’s price is just 52.7% of that. However, Worldcoin holders can take some solace in the fact that their token has found strong psychological support above $4. Source: TradingViewWith a relative strength index (RSI) of 53 and falling, there appears to be some light profit-taking today, although there’s likely to be strong buying momentum over the next two days.Worldcoin outperformed the market leader this week.By contrast, Bitcoin ($BTC) only rose 4% to trade at its current price of $64,140.14 as of Tuesday morning UTC, May 7. OpenAI’s Wordcoin: How Does $WLD Work?
Worldcoin got an ambivalent response on launch last year due to its controversial premise: anyone wanting some $WLD has to visit a biometric eyeball scanner called the ”Orb”—these are found in Berlin, Dubai, London, Mexico City, Miami, New York City, San Francisco, Seoul, and Tokyo— and submit a snapshot of their eyeballs.This data is then used alongside verification of government-issued ID to confirm a user’s personhood before distributing coins to them.OpenAI says Worldcoin is building blockchain infrastructure to bank the world’s unbanked, enabling everyone “to broadly share the coming technological prosperity ” according to its website. “Privacy first. Owned by everyone.” reads the slogan.But many are skeptical, including Ethereum creator Vitalik Buterin who wrote a blog post listing his concerns of the protocol’s privacy, accessibility, centralization and security and said it could take years for it to work.Lawmakers around the world are also keeping tabs on it, with press reports suggesting authorities in Mexico, Malaysia and Argentina have all aired similar concerns.This year the project hit a new high back in January when it welcomed 16,000 Orb signups in a single day after surpassing the 5 million mark the preceding month.From OpenAI’s Worldcoin Database to WienerAI
If Worldcoin’s biometric eyeball database has investors thinking twice, they’re not alone. However, there are many other projects highlighting the potential of greater AI/crypto integration.One such project is the brand new WienerAI, a brand new meme token and AI companion that may yield some potentially eye-watering rallies on listing thanks to its core offering.The presale has already quietly taken in $1.2 million.Touted as a “Revolutionary AI Trading partner”, WienerAI ($WAI) is a digital companion that gives its owners user-friendly AI-enhanced trading advice, seamless swap functionality and zero fees. The WienerAI smart contract was audited by Coinsult, a blockchain security platform that conducts security checks on various crypto and blockchain platforms. Around 20% of $WAI’s supply is for staking. WienerAI’s website encourages buyers to stake during the presale, in order to take advantage of the lucrative yield, which is currently 790% APY . Keep up-to-date with WienerAI news over on X and Telegram. Join the presale now over on the WienerAI website.

Jim Cramer's Market Statement Ignites Buzz in Crypto Community, Here's Why

The crypto community is abuzz following a recent market statement by Jim Cramer, the host of CNBC's Mad Money. Known for his bold market predictions, Cramer's comments have historically served as an unintended contrarian indicator, particularly for crypto investors. His latest statement has once again spotlighted the peculiar trend of his forecasts, often contrary to market outcomes.The markets posted mixed action on Tuesday, with stocks gaining as traders looked for more clues as to when the Federal Reserve may start cutting rates. Cryptocurrencies rather saw a decline, with Bitcoin leading other majors to trade in red, down 1.10% in the last 24 hours to trade at $63,399. In reaction to the market action, Jim Cramer tweeted "look out bears" alongside a GIF image that bore the caption "i will find you." The crypto community's reaction to Cramer's statements is a mix of skepticism and amusement. Many debate the implications of his words, with some viewing them as an indication of the reverse of what he thinks.The community's reaction to Cramer's latest statement is particularly noteworthy given the current uncertainty on the market. Bitcoin rebounded late last week after fresh U.S. jobs data soothed concerns that the economy was overheating and Fed Chairman Jerome Powell ruled out raising interest rates as the central bank’s next move. However, other conflicting economic statistics, such as an increase in the employment cost index, may indicate that the true direction of inflation remains uncertain.Robinhood reported on Monday that the SEC's enforcement staff had written the company a Wells notice, suggesting that it had reached an initial determination to recommend enforcement action — the latest hint that the agency is not backing down from its years-long crackdown on digital assets.Santiment, an on-chain analytics firm, suggests that given social trends, the news surrounding Robinhood could impact market activity throughout May.

Polygon zk-based Miden Alpha Testnet is now live - Blockworks


Polygon, an Ethereum layer-2 scaling solution, has recently launched its Miden Alpha Testnet,  a zero-knowledge rollup solution designed for private, high-throughput applications.
Miden enables its users to generate proofs for their own state transitions without revealing the state to the wider network. The network will only track commitments, meaning users can transact privately.
Some features that will be unlocked with Miden include the ability to create private accounts and private notes, though it will still be possible to create public accounts and public notes. Additionally, the Miden client will enable parallel transaction execution and client-side proving. 
“For builders, that means designing self-sovereign and high-throughput applications. With Miden’s zk-powered rollup, you can build what’s currently not feasible on EVM-chains,” Polygon wrote in a post on X.

According to Polygon Miden documents, there are currently three different types of smart contracts available on Miden. These include a basic wallet contract for sending and receiving tokens and assets and fungible and non-fungible faucet smart contracts, which are used to mint and burn different assets.
Polygon Miden is not the only rollup solution that is hoping to innovate in the zk rollup space. Competitors include StarkWare and Matter Labs, the team behind zkSync, who are similarly hoping to bring new possibilities to blockchain scaling.
There has been little price action following the announcement of Miden. The price of Polygon’s native token (MATIC) is trading at $0.7153, down by 0.9% over the past 24 hours, according to CoinGecko.

Ethena Integrates With Bybit To Add USDe As Collateral Asset - The Defiant

Traders will also get exposure to zero-fee trading with BTC and ETH pairs.Synthetic stablecoin startup Ethena Labs today unveiled an integration with Bybit to add its USDe token as a collateral asset on the crypto exchange.Adding support for USDe will allow users to trade perpetuals while potentially capturing yield on Ethena–which currently sits at 15.3%–along with zero-fee trading on bitcoin and ether spot trades. Bybit users will also integrate the token to its Earn platform.Ethena’s native token, ENA, edged up on the news . It’s up 1.5% to $0.97, at a $1.3 billion market capitalization. The team airdropped 5% of ENA’s total supply to early adopters, amassing a whopping $1 billion market cap on day 1, as the project also kicked off its “Sats Campaign.”ENA Price - CoinGeckoToday’s integration only adds gunpowder to the so-called stablecoin wars, which heated up last week as PayPal enabled PYUSD for cross-border payments, and Ripple touted its own U.S. dollar pegged-stablecoin.According to the team at Ethena, they are mimicking the success of the two top stablecoins on the market, USDT and USDC, which collectively account for more than 90% of the $160 billion stablecoin market capitalization.“The success of USDT and USDC has been deeply tied to its use as money on centralized exchange venues within key trading pairs,” read an X post from the Ethena social media team. “Adding USDe into these spot pairs is the first step in growing adoption beyond DeFi into the most liquid trading venues in the space.”Placing USDe on Bybit is a definite win for the ecosystem, given the exchange’s size. It trails Binance by 24-hour volume with $3.6 billion, landing third according to monthly visits with 39.1 million, and takes the top spot by trust score on CoinGecko.Ethena Climbing the RanksEthena’s ecosystem has been on a tear since it controversially launched in mid February 2024. The startup unveiled a 27% yield on its stablecoin–it has since dropped to 15%–triggering PTSD woes from the Terra collapse.USDe, Ethena’s synthetic stablecoin, backs the token that is pegged to $1, with staked ETH on Lido, while also hedging stETH with short ETH positions on centralized exchanges. Both stETH and short positions contribute to yield that’s passed on to stablecoin holders.After its aforementioned airdrop, USDe quickly climbed the ranks, and holds fifth place for stablecoins according to CoinGecko. It added 20% to its $2.4 billion market cap in early April, although it has since declined , settling on $2.29 billion.In early April, Ethena also added bitcoin as a collateral asset for USDe, a move intended to help the delta-hedged synthetic dollar scale by accessing the Bitcoin futures market.

Buy altcoins now, but sell before ‘mid-2025’: Charles Edwards, X Hall of Flame


            
Crypto on-chain analyst Charles Edwards, the co-founder of the digital assets hedge fund Capriole Investments, believes now is the perfect time to get “some allocation” into altcoins.



But he says you probably shouldn’t hold onto them for too long.



“If this is a normal four-year cycle, which so far has been playing out like a textbook like the previous cycles, we can expect that Bitcoin will probably top either later this year or next year,” the Australian-based crypto analyst tells Hall of Flame.



“If that happens, and when Bitcoin does enter a bear market like it has done in the past, you definitely don’t want to be holding altcoins from mid-2025 onward,” Edwards declares in an authoritative tone similar to the one he uses with his 104,200 X followers.




“I think that this is the 12-month window you want to own them. Not any other years. Probably not at all in 2026 or 2027.”




In previous bear markets, altcoins have suffered much larger drawdowns compared to Bitcoin.



“It depends on Bitcoin, as [if there is] any kind of major pullback, obviously altcoins are gonna get destroyed. So whenever Bitcoin is down massively, altcoins go down much more,” he explains.






But Edwards plays devil’s advocate with his own prediction, noting that things “could be different” this cycle due to the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) approving spot Bitcoin ETFs at the start of this year. It’s possible there won’t be an altseason.



“We don’t have anything for altcoins or Ethereum that could be a driving factor. Like if the majority of the flows and demand this cycle is institutional, then maybe altcoins don’t see the same growth,” he says.







When Edwards isn’t busy running his hedge fund, he spends time working on technical analysis about Bitcoin’s price, and spotting trends, which he posts about on X.



“I suppose I noticed the power of Twitter and social media back in 2019, probably during the first six months when I started working,” he says, of a period when the Bitcoin price was around $8,000.



“This was just writing a lot of articles and trying to share as much research as I could and Bitcoin-related strategies on Medium, TradingView and Twitter,” he adds.



(X/Charles Edwards)



Edwards felt like he was getting “into a bit of a rhythm” with consistent posting during an “exciting growth stage” as his account grew from “zero to 10,000” followers, and admits he became a bit lazier after that.



“From there, I was probably not as consistent as I could have been,” he laughs.






Consistent or not, Edwards must’ve posted enough interesting content to rack up over 100K followers.




“I think if you frequently post good quality content and be consistent in your area and keep doing that you’ll probably grow because it doesn’t matter what nature is if it’s crypto or anything else, there’s gonna be other people interested.”




What type of crypto research content does Charles Edwards produce?



Edwards mainly analyzes all things Bitcoin — from price movements and ETF inflows to things like the cost of electricity per Bitcoin.



“Most of the content revolves around valuation metrics and identifying when Bitcoin is over or undervalued, with the rest a bit of technical analysis related,” he says.



He also posts content on altcoins every now and then for those who are interested.



(X/Charles Edwards)



Edwards discusses the macro market conditions from time to time, although he believes that the crypto community “often finds it boring and it doesn’t get much engagement.”



Regardless, Edwards believes macro plays a big role in Bitcoin markets and plans to keep doing it.






“It is a big driver of what happens in the Bitcoin ecosystem as well. So I find that data really interesting,” he says.







Edwards is a fan of several crypto accounts in the space, mainly those that similarly pick apart the market and identify emerging trends in Bitcoin and other altcoins.



Crypto on-chain analyst Willy Woo and memecoin analyst Murad are two in particular.



(X/Charles Edwards)



Apart from Woo, for on-chain analysis, Edwards is a fan of Reflexivity Research co-founder Will Clemente and fellow Australian analyst James Check, aka “Checkmatey.”



For technical analysis, Edwards believes that pseudonymous crypto trader DonAlt “is probably the best in the space.”



Charles Edwards’ Bitcoin price prediction



Edwards believes that the “two or three-month window” after the April Bitcoin halving is typically pretty volatile, but he has a positive outlook for Bitcoin holders when considering the next twelve months as a whole.



“Zooming out the next 365 days minus a few days, the halving is usually the best risk-reward period for Bitcoin in terms of you usually get strong positive trends with very limited drawdowns,” he explains.



“So base case expectation over the next year for me is a great returning period for Bitcoin,” he predicts.



Two months before the April Bitcoin halving event, he told his followers on X that if the returns matched those following the 2020 halving, Bitcoin could hit $280,000 next year.



(X/Charles Edwards)



Edwards is unsure whether it will be “straight up or consolidation and straight up,” but either way, those holding for the next 12 months are “probably going to do very well.”

Bitfinex CTO Dismisses Hacking Claims as "Fake" amid Data Breach Concerns



                    

Bitfinex‘s chief technology officer Paolo Ardoino dismissed claims by hacking group Fsociety that it hacked the cryptocurrency exchange’s database and leaked 22,500 customer emails and passwords. 



Ardoino labeled the claims as “fake” and stated, “If they had any real information they would have asked a ransom through our bug bounty, customer support ticket, emails, Twitter, etc. 




“We couldn’t find any request.” He emphasized that Bitfinex does not store plaintext passwords or 2FA secrets in clear text.



Out of the 22,500 records leaked, only 5,000 matched with Bitfinex users. 



Ardoino suggested that the hackers likely obtained the data from other crypto data breaches, noting that many users use the same email and passwords across multiple sites.




A security researcher shared a message suggesting that the hackers might be using the claim to promote a data retrieval hacking tool.

According to the researcher, such claims serve as advertisements for the tool, enticing others to purchase it for exploiting companies.



Ardoino reassured users that investigations were ongoing, but no breach had been detected, and all funds remained safe. 




This incident isn’t the first time Bitfinex has faced scrutiny over data breaches. 



In November 2023, a minor information security incident occurred when one of its customer support agents was hacked, leading to phishing attacks targeting Bitfinex users. 



However, Bitfinex stated that little harm resulted from the incident.



In 2016, Bitfinex experienced a major security breach resulting in the loss of 119,576 customers’ Bitcoin, valued at around $70 million at the time, equivalent to approximately $7.6 billion at current prices.

                        Now detained Binance executive Tigran Gambaryan and representatives of the crypto exchange were allegedly pressured by a government official to accept a secret agreement to settle Nigeria’s claims against the exchange, Binance CEO Richard Teng revealed in a blog post on Tuesday.According to Teng, Gambaryan and several Binance employees attended a meeting with members of Nigeria’s House Committee on Financial Crimes (HCFC) to discuss “the nature of the issues at hand” ahead of a pre-investigative hearing involving the crypto exchange. Nigerian Officials Offered Secret Settlement Deal, Richard Teng Claims
During the meeting, HCFC officials allegedly warned the Binance employees that they were prepared to issue arrest warrants against them and prevent them from leaving the country.As Binance employees left this meeting, they were allegedly “approached by unknown persons” who promised to “make these issues go away” should they accept a secret settlement.According to a Tuesday report by The New York Times, this “settlement” was actually a $150 million bribe from “someone in the Nigerian government.”“Counsel reported back that he had been presented with a demand for a significant payment in cryptocurrency to be paid in secret within 48 hours to make these issues go away and that our decision was expected by the morning,” Teng wrote. “Our team grew increasingly concerned about their safety in Nigeria and immediately departed.”Gambaryan and fellow Binance executive Nadeem Anjarwalla traveled back to Nigeria the following month for a meeting with the CEO of the Nigerian SEC, the country’s national security adviser, and the central bank’s deputy governor.“Despite the clear risks, Tigran Gambaryan and Nadeem Anjarwalla (Head of Binance Africa) received multiple assurances that they would be granted safe passage for their meetings,” Teng said.It was following this meeting that the duo was detained, with Anjarwalla fleeing shortly thereafter, only to be reportedly recaptured in Kenya just weeks ago.Detained Nigerian Binance Executives’ Fate Remains Unknown
The news of the bribe comes as Nigeria announced plans to delist the naira from peer-to-peer (P2P) platforms to prevent manipulation. Changes are set to roll out in the coming days.The country’s government previously blamed the cryptocurrency sector for crashing the value of the nation’s currency, with inflation hitting a near 30-year high of 33.20% in March. Meanwhile, both Gambaryan and Anjarwalla have been charged with money laundering and tax evasion.The two Binance executives are due back in court for a hearing on May 17.

Franklin Templeton praises the Solana crypto

Franklin Templeton, one of the leading investment companies with assets under management of over $1.5 trillion, considers Solana as the crypto with the potential to become the third largest in the market. 
The company praised the resilience of the project, the frequency of its new releases, and the efforts made by developers to solve recent network congestion issues. Let’s see all the details below. 

Franklin Templeton praises the Solana crypto
As anticipated, Franklin Templeton, an investment company with $1.5 trillion in assets under management (AUM), has praised the growth path of Solana. 
In particular, emphasizing that the network has the potential to establish itself in the vast market of cryptocurrencies. 
In a statement released on social media, the company stated that Solana has benefited from the acceleration of the cryptocurrency market in the fourth quarter of 2023, thanks to a series of native airdrops that have boosted the entire SOL ecosystem.
Franklin Templeton also highlighted the resilience of the Solana network. Despite the hard hit suffered following the failure of FTX in 2022, the network has recovered with a significant increase in adoption. 
Thanks to its low fees and scalability, Solana has managed to ride the trend of memecoins, giving life to popular tokens like BONK and WIF, which have remained among the top 100 cryptocurrencies by market capitalization.
The company expects a steady growth for Solana, thanks to its performance and network effects that could attract future cryptocurrency trends. 
The network hosts numerous projects ranging from payments to decentralized infrastructures, to compressed non-fungible tokens (NFTs). Furthermore, according to Franklin Templeton, these initiatives could drive the next wave of adoption.
In the company’s statement, the following is written:
“Cryptocurrency enthusiasts wonder what the next big success will be. Although we cannot predict it with certainty, we believe that Solana has a good chance of being a protagonist.”
Franklin Templeton acknowledges that the increase in activity has created operational issues for Solana, but has praised the developers for their commitment to quickly resolve these issues. 
The company concludes by stating that Solana could become the third most important cryptographic asset after Bitcoin and Ethereum, and could be the network that will lead the next major phase of adoption in the world of cryptocurrencies.
Solana’s price is rising: positive outlook and upward forecasts
The current price of Solana (SOL) is around 158.30 dollars, supported by a strong trading volume of 70.91 billion dollars in the last 24 hours. The market capitalization is 2.98 billion dollars, with a dominant market share of 24%.
The sentiment towards Solana remains strongly bullish, with a score of 68 on the Fear & Greed index, indicating greed among investors. 
The circulating supply of Solana is 447.98 million SOL, out of a maximum of 533.68 million, with an annual inflation rate of 13.67% and the creation of 53.86 million SOL in the last year.
Solana could soon break new price levels thanks to recent significant transactions, often attributed to institutional investors or whales, which have reignited optimism in the market. 
These strategic movements, such as the transfer of a large amount of SOL tokens from Binance to an undisclosed wallet, suggest a growing confidence in the future of Solana.
Furthermore, the rise in the price of SOL comes as the overall market of cryptocurrencies is recovering from a period of volatility.
The decision of the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) to keep interest rates stable has helped strengthen investor confidence.
The announcement of the Solana-Bitcoin bridge planned for the third quarter of 2024 adds further excitement, as this connection could expand the utility of Solana and stimulate the demand for SOL tokens. 
This development could further push up the price of Solana, consolidating its position in the decentralized finance (DeFi) landscape and in cross-chain transactions.

Crypto must adapt to laws, not the other way around - John Reed Stark

John Reed Stark, a former Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) official, has accused the crypto industry of perpetuating myths to obscure its lack of transparency and accountability, dismissing claims of “regulation by enforcement” taken by the agency.Stark’s comments were made at a U.S. House Financial Services Committee hearing on May 7. According to the SEC's former internet enforcement chief , the crypto industry has been refusing to conform to established laws while expecting the legal framework to bend to its needs:“The catchphrase of SEC regulation by enforcement [...] falls squarely into that last category. Just plain false. [...] Crypto promoters represent the most important recent example of industry players accusing the SEC of unfairly policing the markets. I’ve never witnessed such a well-funded, coordinated, and unfounded assault on the SEC and its mission.”According to Stark, what has been called “regulation by enforcement” within the crypto industry is just the regulator performing its duties. “The rest of us simply call enforcing the law.”“Digital assets typically have no cash flow, no yield, no employees, no management, no balance sheet, no product, no service, no history of operations, no earnings reports, no proven track record of adoption or reliance. [...] How can any financial analyst, let alone any everyday investor, conduct a proper valuation amid such a boundless data vacuum?” Stark questioned during the session.

Source: Financial Services CommitteeWithin the crypto industry, the term “regulation by enforcement” is often used to criticize how the SEC has been enforcing rules and regulations. Rather than developing clear, formal regulations through formal legislation or rulemaking process, the industry argues that the SEC is establishing regulatory precedents through enforcement actions.“Don’t get me wrong, the SEC is far from perfect. There are SEC cases and SEC rules that I believe are unfair. [...] the SEC has not gone rogue but is simply just doing its job. [...] the [digital] asset industry needs to get its act together and adapt to the laws that apply to it, not the other way around.”The hearing focused on examining and improving the Commission’s enforcement practices, with heavy criticism directed at the agency’s approach and the effects it had on businesses and individuals.During the hearing, Nick Morgan, founder of the Investor Choice Advocates Network (ICAN), accused the SEC of producing “piecemeal litigation on a case-by-case basis” in reference to cases in which the Commission “is free to ignore adverse rulings in some jurisdictions to seek more favorable results in other jurisdictions.” Morgan continued: “Among many problems, the SEC’s regulation by enforcement policy causes legal uncertainty for ordinary people, including people not accused of fraud who are forced to litigate policy matters on a case-by-case basis, even when a federal appellate court rules against the SEC on a particular policy.”Magazine: Lawmakers’ fear and doubt drives proposed crypto regulations in US

Bitcoin above $64K - Here's the impact on memecoins like Dogecoin, Shiba Inu - AMBCrypto



The overall memecoin market plunged, led by DOGE, SHIB, and PEPE.
Technical analysis shows potential further declines for the altcoin market.

The cryptocurrency market has witnessed significant fluctuations recently, with meme coins experiencing a notable downturn. 
These whimsically themed cryptocurrencies, often inspired by internet memes and jokes, have seen a collective market cap reduction to $54.5 billion, a 3.3% decline just in the past day.
Despite their typically volatile nature, the decline has been sharp and influenced primarily by major players such as Dogecoin [DOGE], Shiba Inu [SHIB], and Pepe [PEPE]. 
After a period of robust growth, where Dogecoin, for instance, surged by 9.8% last week, it along with PEPE faced a downturn exceeding 4% in a single day. 
Shiba Inu, on the other hand, has been experiencing a steady decrease over the week, culminating in a 4.5% drop yesterday. 
This series of declines has sparked conversations and concerns regarding the sustainability of meme coins in a bearish market.
However, while price performance may bring Shiba Inu as the most red in the top 3 meme coin market, AMBCrypto has recently reported that a projection of $0.000031 being the immediate target for SHIB should the bulls prevail. 
Memecoins market shift coming
The downturn in memecoin values coincides with a broader decline in their trading volumes. 
According to Dune Analytics, memecoin transaction volumes across major blockchains such as Ethereum [ETH] and Solana [SOL] have plummeted dramatically. 
Source: Dune
From a high of nearly $998.55 million in March, the weekly trading volume has shockingly dropped to just $1.6 million as of the 6th of May. 
This stark reduction indicates a significant waning of trader interest and confidence in these digital assets.
Looking more closely, individual meme coins have mirrored this trend. 
Dogecoin’s trading volume, for instance, halved by 50% over the last two months, while Shiba Inu and PEPE saw their volumes decrease by over 80% and 50% respectively. 
This overall market behavior reflects a broader disinterest from investors.
Implications for the broader crypto market
The downturn in meme coins could be a precursor to wider market challenges. Traditionally, bull markets in the cryptocurrency sector are often propelled by a surge in altcoin activities. 
However, the recent downturn across the board suggests that bearish trends may continue to dominate the broader crypto landscape.
In technical terms, the TOTAL3 chart — the total market cap of all cryptocurrencies excluding Bitcoin [BTC] and Ethereum, has demonstrated multiple structural breaks to the downside. 
This indicates a possible prolonged bearish phase for altcoins.

Furthermore, the altcoin market has recently tested a significant supply zone on the 6-hour chart, marked by a shooting star followed by a bearish engulfing candlestick pattern closing below the shooting star. 
This sequence suggests that the altcoin market may continue to face downward pressure until a swing low has been taken out, then, then a potential reversal to the upside might be possible.

This Is Not The Time To Sell Chainlink: Industry Veteran Predicts Price Will Reach New ATH | Bitcoinist.com


								Popular cryptocurrency analyst, Michael van de Poppe has predicted a major bullish breakout for Chainlink (LINK), urging investors to hold on to their cryptocurrencies despite market volatility. 
Analyst Cautions Against Premature Sell-Off
In an X (formerly Twitter) post on Monday, May 5, Poppe shared a LINK/BTC price chart, depicting historical price movements from 2018 to 2025. Based on the technical analysis of the cryptocurrency’s price action across previous market cycles, the crypto analyst noted that Chainlink was presently undergoing a retest at its low point. 

This suggests that the cryptocurrency is experiencing a phase of reassessment and potential stabilization, followed by a possible price rebound. Poppe has disclosed that initiating sell-offs during Chainlink’s current price stage may not be a strategic move, as doing so could result in investors missing out on potential gains when the market rebounds from the temporary weakness. 
Highlighted in the price chart, the analyst disclosed that $0.0004480 was a crucial resistance level for a potentially strong breakout upwards. Additionally, the LINK/BTC ratio could undergo a trend switch at $0.0006721, as it begins to make “higher lows and higher highs.”
In addition to the optimistic outlook, the crypto analyst previously disclosed that Chainlink was getting close to its “bottom,” potentially testing new lows around 2,000 Satoshis (SATs) before surging upwards. He revealed that this phase was a prime buying period, acknowledging in an earlier post that he was already investing in Chainlink. 
At the time of writing, Chainlink is down by 3.54% in the last 24 hours and trading at a price of $14.5%, according to CoinMarketCap. While the present market condition may have contributed to the price decline, the cryptocurrency has remained relatively stable, witnessing a price increase of 6.28% over the past seven days, and a massive 75.15% surge in its 24-hour trading volume. 
Chainlink Becomes Top RWA By Development
Chainlink has ranked number one among the top Real World Assets (RWA) by development activities. According to market intelligence platform Santiment, Chainlink emerged as the leading project in the RWA sector, witnessing activities 2.49 times greater than that of the next most active project, Synthetix (SNX). 

The blockchain platform disclosed that the top list was compiled by GitHub, an online software development platform. The criteria for evaluating the top RWA project in terms of development was based on counting non-redundant GitHub activities and averaging this daily activity over the past 30 days. 
The result of the evaluation revealed Chainlink’s high level of developer engagement and activities, underscoring the ongoing progress and innovative processes within the crypto project.

Bitcoin Local Bottom In? Analyst Offers Insights


                            In an ever-evolving world of cryptocurrency markets, deciding the bottom of Bitcoin price correction is an endeavor that attracts interest from both investors and analysts. Joining the fray is cryptocurrency analyst and trader MilkyBull offering insights on the subject, claiming that Bitcoin’s local bottom has developed due to a certain development.
Following its weekend recovery out of bear market territory, the price of Bitcoin slightly decreased on Monday. However, MilkyBull is confident that the recent retracement might be the last before BTC turns to move on the upside.
Bitcoin Local Bottom Is In
According to the expert, given that the next liquidity grab interest is above $64,557, the local bottom for Bitcoin is in. As a result, before moving on to the current all-time high of $73,000, BTC will first clear the $67,000 price level and consolidate. Thus, Bitcoin may eliminate the CME gap below either prior to or subsequent to eliminating the liquidity above $64,975. 
Related Reading: Bitcoin Bottom In? Retracement From $73,800 Is Deeper And Took Longer To Form
The CME gap is a price difference that occurs between the Friday closing price and Sunday opening prices of the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME) Bitcoin futures market. Therefore, the expert considers this development a good area for long trade, signaling a buying opportunity for BTC bullish investors.

MilkyBull further drew attention to a previous analysis that suggests Bitcoin could be poised for a rally due to historical patterns. The analyst noted that the 2017 price action shows that when BTC breached a new all-time high, there was a healthy retracement that was driven by liquidity before it surged to a cycle peak. 
Given that BTC might be mirroring this pattern, MilkyBull’s analysis might suggest that BTC has undergone its last shakeout, and a move on the upside could be imminent. He also confirmed that the present consolidation range was paralleled by the preceding consolidation, which began to materialize from December 2023 to February 2024. 
This pattern, identified as a manipulative strategy of the market makers (MMs) by the expert, is meant to remove degenerate Short-Term Holders (STHs), which are particularly vulnerable to price corrections below their cost base.
BTC Correction On The Horizon
While MilkyBull anticipates a rally, market expert Benjamin Cowen expects the leading cryptocurrency asset to drop in the upcoming days. Last week, Cowen claimed BTC’s Return On Investment (ROI) 12 days after the Bitcoin Halving event was the worst performance that the asset has experienced. According to Cowen, this is reasonable as it is the first time BTC is reaching a new all-time high before the Halving.

Almost a week later, there is still no improvement, as the analyst noted that BTC ROI is still performing worse than in previous cycles. Comparing this action with that of 2016, Cowen expects BTC to undergo a decline in the coming week.
During the time of writing, BTC was trading at $63,970, demonstrating an increase of over 3% in the past week. While its market cap is down by 1.17%, its daily trading volume has garnered positive sentiment, rising by 40%.

Robinhood CEO Decries 'Regulatory Onslaught' on Crypto, Vows to Fight SEC - Decrypt

Robinhood CEO Vlad Tenev has become Wall Street’s latest power player to blast a wave of enforcement action notices from the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).The retail trading platform disclosed Friday that it had received a Wells Notice from the SEC. Put on notice that an enforcement action could be coming, Robinhood Crypto said the agency had previously scrutinized its token listings and crypto custody practices in a filing.“The SEC’s continued attack on crypto, coupled with recent rule proposals, [...] mark yet another improper attempt by the administrative state to stifle innovation,” Tenev said in a Twitter post Monday, describing a “regulatory onslaught” that has hamstrung American firms and investors.Following similar warnings sent to the Ethereum giant Consensys and Uniswap maker Uniswap Labs, Robinhood Crypto finds itself as a distinct target in the SEC’s crosshairs. Robinhood isn’t a crypto-native company, but began offering investors Bitcoin and Ethereum through its app in 2018. Over the years, it’s also claimed to grow those offerings cautiously through its crypto arm.Testifying before lawmakers on Capitol Hill last year, Robinhood Markets Chief Legal, Compliance, and Corporate Affairs Officer Dan Gallagher said the firm’s choices are motivated by a “safety-first” approach. That includes a conscious choice not to offer customers products involving crypto lending or staking, where investors can delegate tokens to a network and receive rewards.“Unlike some of our competitors that have grown quickly and list hundreds of digital assets on their platform, Robinhood Crypto has taken a more conservative approach,” Gallagher said, adding that it “does not list digital asset securities” among the 18 tokens available on its platform.After the SEC sued Binance and Coinbase last year, however, Robinhood Crypto moved to end support for tokens the SEC claimed to be securities. ​​The firm’s U.S. users lost access to trading altcoins such as Cardano (ADA), Polygon (MATIC), and Solana (SOL) in a few weeks.During his testimony, Gallagher, who served as an SEC Commissioner from 2011 to 2015, also said it was “critical” to address the lack of regulatory clarity in crypto, so companies need not worry about “the constant threat of crippling enforcement actions.”Robinhood Crypto has encountered regulatory hurdles before. Penalized by the New York Department of Financial Services in 2022, the company paid $30 million to settle charges over alleged compliance failures regarding its cybersecurity and transaction monitoring practices.On top of that, Robinhood agreed to pay $65 million in 2020 to settle charges brought by the SEC over misleading statements allegedly made to investors. Then in 2021, the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority ordered Robinhood to pay a $70 million fine over “widespread and significant harm suffered by customers”—levying its largest-ever financial penalty.Nonetheless, Tenev said that Robinhood Crypto isn’t afraid of a court battle with Wall Street’s top regulator on Twitter Monday. He said. “While we strive to maintain positive and productive relationships with our regulators, if necessary we will use our resources to contest this matter in the courts.”Edited by Andrew HaywardStay on top of crypto news, get daily updates in your inbox.

Coinbase Gets Hit With New Class Action Lawsuit Accusing Crypto Exchange of Selling Digital Asset Securities - The Daily Hodl


								A newly filed class-action complaint alleges that Coinbase violated US securities laws.
The complaint, which was filed in the Northern District of California’s San Francisco division on Friday, claims that the top US crypto exchange has been operating as “part of a shadowy crypto ecosystem operating just outside of the law.”










“Its entire business model has been built upon a lie and a dream: the lie is that ‘we do not sell securities,’ and the dream is that, knowing it would eventually be caught in the lie, ‘it is better to ask for forgiveness than permission.’
Coinbase has knowingly, intentionally, and repeatedly violated state securities laws since it began doing business.”
The complainants accuse the exchange of offering numerous unregistered “digital asset securities,” including the layer-1 blockchain projects Solana (SOL), NEAR Protocol (NEAR), Algorand (ALGO), Stellar (XLM) and Tezos (XTZ); the blockchain scaling solution Polygon (MATIC); the decentralized exchange Uniswap (UNI); and the Ethereum (ETH)-based virtual reality platform Decentraland (MANA).
The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has also accused Coinbase of violating securities laws, launching a lawsuit against the exchange in June 2023.
Coinbase has argued that trading digital assets doesn’t qualify as an “investment contract” under the Howey Test, an assessment created by the Supreme Court more than 90 years ago to determine whether assets should be classified as securities.

Uniswap Votes To Transfer Second 1M UNI Grant To DeFi Education Fund - The Defiant

The DEF shocked the web3 community by abruptly selling half of the 1M UNI grant it received in 2021.Uniswap, the top spot decentralized exchange by trade volume, has voted in favor of renewing its financial support for the DeFi Education Fund (DEF), a web3 advocacy organization.On May 5, Uniswap governance passed a temperature check proposal requesting 1 million UNI tokens ($7.58 million) in additional funding supporting the DEF’s operations opposing legislative threats targeting the DeFi sector.Half of the funds will be transferred to DEF’s Coinbase account immediately, with the remaining assets streaming over a 12-month linear vesting period. More than 77% of votes were cast in favor of the proposal, with 10% opposing and nearly 13% abstaining.“Over the last few years, DeFi’s policy challenges have become more real, more imminent, and more numerous,” DEF said. “DEF has defended DeFi from legislative threats that would require DeFi developers to implement protocol access restrictions or requirements designed for CeFi businesses… Given the steady stream of anti-crypto rulemaking coming from administrative agencies and certain members of Congress, now is not the time to take our foot off the pedal.”A back-up proposal suggesting alternative funding plans closed with 33.5% of votes supporting an allocation of just 300,000 UNI ($2.27 million), followed by 29.6% of votes backing 1 million UNI, and 27.6% championing a 27.6% allotment. “If the original DeFi Education Fund Temp Check passes, then the original Temp Check will take precedence,” the proposal said.In March, the DEF sued the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) in a bid to establish a legal precedent that airdropped tokens do not comprise securities investment contracts. The move was intended to protect projects airdropping tokens to early adopters from regulatory action from the SEC.Sour memoriesIn July 2021, DEF ruffled feathers across the Uniswap and web3 communities when it immediately offloaded half of the 1 million UNI tokens it received from Uniswap following a governance vote.The DEF failed to provide advance notice of the sales, eliciting pushback from the crypto community. The backlash was intensified after reports claimed that Larry Sukernik, a DEF committee member, sold $50,000 after the organization dumped its tokens.In February, Uniswap began selling its remaining funds per an 18-month sales plan intended to provide the organization with a financial runway until July 2025. The plan involves quarterly transfers of 125,000 UNI from its multisig account to fund monthly sales.In its latest proposal, DEF pledged to hold onto the funds for at least 12 months from the date of receipt, in addition to pre-disclosing any sales prior to offloading UNI moving forward.DEF said it pays law firms, lobbying organizations, and its employees using U.S. dollars — necessitating the sale of its UNI holdings.Uniswap Foundation’s financialsOn May 3, Uniswap Foundation, the non-profit organization founded in August 2022 to support Uniswap's development, published its financials for 2023.The foundation said it holds roughly $45.2 million in U.S. dollars and stablecoins in addition to 780,000 UNI ($5.9 million) after spending $3.56 million throughout the year. Nearly 70% of its non-UNI assets are earmarked for past and future grant funding, leaving $13.75 million to fund future operations. Uniswap Foundation said the funds can support its operations until the end of 2025.A governance proposal published on March 19 estimated that the Uniswap DAO held almost $6 billion in assets, with the funds predominantly comprising UNI. The price of UNI is down 36%, suggesting the DAO’s treasury assets are currently worth around $3.85 billion.

Did a Whale Miss the PEPE Train? Massive Sell-Off Triggers Price Crash | Cryptoglobe


                                
large transaction involving the meme-based cryptocurrency $PEPE sent its price tumbling on Tuesday after a massive cryptocurrency whale deposited their holdings of the meme-inspired cryptocurrency onto leading cryptocurrency exchange Binance.



According to data from on-chain analysis service Spot On Chain, a multisig wallet deposited a massive 1.238 trillion PEPE tokens, valued at roughly $10.6 million, onto the Binance exchange just ahead of a price drop of around 5.2%, suggesting the whale dumped their tokens on the market.



The identity of the wallet owner remains unknown, but the substantial amount of PEPE transferred suggests the involvement of a major investor, often referred to in the cryptocurrency world as a “whale.” Further analysis by Spot On Chain indicates that this whale only held the $PEPE tokens for three days and if the tokens were indeed sold on Binance, they registered a gain of just 1.28%, or $134,000 given the size of the transaction.







This isn’t the first time cryptocurrency whales fail to make significant gains with PEPE. Last year, shortly after PEPE saw its price skyrocket in a couple of weeks several whales bet on it, before its price plunged.







            
            

            
            

            
            

        

The drop saw one specific whale lose a whopping $500,000 on the trade shortly after PEPE made its debut on the leading cryptocurrency exchange Binance. When the exchange first listed PEPE, it cautioned potential investors that PEPE lacks any inherent utility or value support mechanism. PEPE has been accused of potential insider trading, as 7% of the total token supply was reportedly purchased by insiders or team members minutes after the token generation event.



Earlier, a  fortunate cryptocurrency investor has seemingly managed to turn an investment of just 0.125 ETH in PEPE into a staggering $1.14 million in just a matter of days by buying into it at the right time.

Court decision could be only way US spot ether ETFs see light of day - Blockworks


The advent of bitcoin ETFs came only after a legal victory over the Securities and Exchange Commission.
A similar action could be what it takes to get US spot ether ETFs over the finish line, law professionals told Blockworks.
And let’s not forget Consensys’ lawsuit against the US securities regulator, which they added could play a role in helping sort out the ether ETF question.
Bitcoin ETFs born from a legal victory
In a world where the SEC and crypto companies constantly appear to be at odds, the courts have been able to offer some clarity. 
Judges in the DC Circuit Court of Appeals ruled last August that the SEC’s decision to deny the conversion of the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) to an ETF, but allow bitcoin futures ETFs, was “arbitrary and capricious.”
SEC Chairman Gary Gensler said in a January statement that approving bitcoin ETFs was “the most sustainable path forward” given that court decision. He added that the regulator “acts within the law and how the courts interpret the law.”
Enter: proposed funds that would directly hold ETH — the second-biggest crypto asset by market capitalization. 
Investment firm VanEck first filed for a spot ether product in 2021. The company, along with Ark Invest and 21Shares, renewed the efforts last September. BlackRock and Grayscale were among those to follow suit.  
The SEC, as expected, delayed its decision on Monday for a spot ether fund filed by Invesco and Galaxy Digital. A ruling on other similar planned offerings by Ark Invest, VanEck, Grayscale, BlackRock and others is expected by the end of the month.Various segment observers have said they don’t expect the US regulator to approve them. This is due to concerns over the liquidity of ETH’s spot and futures markets and the question of its status as a security or commodity.
Read more: Ether ETFs coming in May? Here’s why many are bearish
The “cleanest path” for the SEC to deny the spot ether ETFs would be solely based on the correlation between the ETH futures and spot markets, Van Buren Capital general partner Scott Johnsson said in an April 25 X post.
Bitwise, a fund group with its own ether ETF filing, submitted a data analysis showing what it called a correlation between the ETH futures and spot markets that are “substantially similar” to that of bitcoin. 

“They probably overextend, and push for more reasons, because correlation concerns will only result in a temporary delay (and they know this),” Johnsson added at the time.
Suing again could be the best route
Court intervention is of course not needed for the SEC to greenlight spot ether funds, noted Liz Boison, a partner at law firm Hogan Lovells. 
But it appears it could come to that.
“We should expect that one of the applicants will sue the SEC if the SEC either unreasonably extends the deadline or disapproves the application,” Boison told Blockworks. “Just as the Grayscale suit succeeded in giving the SEC a court-ordered deadline, the ether spot funds will want the same.”
A Grayscale spokesperson did not immediately return a request for comment. 
Hailey Lennon, a corporate partner in Brown Rudnick’s digital commerce unit, said she too thinks issuers will consider fighting a potential ether ETF application denial in court. 
“The SEC has typically regulated the cryptocurrency industry through enforcement action and has not provided regulatory clarity until it’s pressured to do so by the courts,” Lennon said. “I do think a decision by the court may be the only way we see the spot ether ETFs approved.”
Many of the same arguments can be made for a spot ether ETF, she contended. After all, the SEC approved ether futures-based ETFs in October, and companies may argue — like in the Grayscale lawsuit — that those approvals set a precedent for spot ether products. 
Muddying the water is additional complexities around the SEC possibly looking to treat ETH as a security, whereas the regulator had clearly labeled bitcoin a commodity.
Not all agree that issuers suing the SEC — should the regulator deny the ether funds — is a foregone conclusion.
Bloomberg Intelligence analyst Eric Balchunas questioned that assumption in an April 10 X post, noting the disparity between the assets in ether futures ETFs compared to bitcoin futures ETFs.
The largest bitcoin futures ETF — the ProShares Bitcoin Strategy ETF (BITO) — has grown to nearly $1.9 billion in assets. ProShares’ ETH futures fund, also the largest in that category, has $70 million.
“That’s a lot of time and money for something that may only get a fraction of the [assets under management],” he added.

Whether prospective ether ETF issuers choose to sue the SEC or not, another court case could help efforts to launch such products.
Consensys legal action could offer answers   
MetaMask developer ConsenSys sued the SEC last month in a case alleging regulatory overreach. The suit is expected to put pressure on the SEC to defend any position it might have that ETH is a security.
“The SEC has been notoriously tight-lipped about their classification of ETH,” Lennon said. “The SEC is likely trying to retain their stance that Ethereum and bitcoin are not the same, especially after the Ethereum Merge in September 2022 when Ethereum moved from proof of work to proof of stake.”
Read more: SEC has been investigating ETH for over a year, new court filing shows 
The portion of the suit requesting a declaratory judgment that ETH is not a security likely will require the SEC to shed light on its stance, Boison explained.
Approval of spot ether ETFs could take place before briefing in the Consensys case is complete, she noted.
Boison added: “The SEC can theoretically approve spot ether ETFs, file charges regarding staked ether and still have a court declare that ETH, itself, is not a security.”

RFK Jr., a Pro-Crypto U.S. Presidential Candidiate, to Appear at Consensus 2024

Crypto has increasingly become politicized in the U.S., with many Republicans pro-crypto and Democrats opposed or skeptical at best. Kennedy is a member of a famously Democratic family (that has endorsed Biden). His uncle, John F. Kennedy, served as U.S. president in the 1960s, and his father served as U.S. Attorney General during that administration before running for president.

AI predicts Cardano price for May 31, 2024


Cardano (ADA), renowned for its innovative third-generation blockchain technology, is currently navigating a challenging market landscape. After a short-lived rally earlier in the month that momentarily pushed its price from $0.45 to $0.46, ADA has since retreated, hovering around the $0.45 mark. 
This pattern of rapid gains followed by setbacks reflects the ongoing volatility and investor uncertainty surrounding the cryptocurrency. Despite a rise in active addresses signaling a renewed interest in the platform, the overall market sentiment remains tepid. 
Technical indicators and a notable decline in trading volume cast shadows over ADA’s immediate price prospects, suggesting a continuation of the current bearish trend.


A concerning ‘death cross’ formation in ADA’s moving averages further complicates the outlook, typically indicating a potential sell-off phase.
AI predictions and market sentiments

The short-term outlook for ADA, according to AI predictions from sources like CoinCodex, remains somewhat optimistic. By May 31, 2024, ADA is expected to see an increase of 2.06%, potentially reaching approximately $0.4613.This prediction suggests that despite current market struggles, there may be a modest upward movement in the coming weeks.

ADA is currently trading at $0.453, marking a 1.69% loss in the last 24 hours and extending a retracement of 3.81% over the past week. The negative trend has persisted over the last 30 days, with Cardano losing 23.59% of its value.
Additionally, Ali Martinez predicts a potential parabolic run for ADA, which could see a 2,480% increase to $9.98 in the next nine months, based on historical patterns. Despite the evolving crypto market dynamics, which now exhibit less volatility, Martinez suggests that the recent correction might offer one of the last opportunities to buy ADA at a dip, anticipating substantial future gains if trends follow past patterns. 

Network developments and future prospects
Cardano continues to achieve significant milestones, recently recording 90 million transactions on its network, a testament to its growing adoption and utility

The imminent deployment of the Ouroboros Genesis as part of network upgrades and enhancements to its Plutus smart contract platform is expected to significantly boost Cardano’s infrastructure, potentially increasing its market appeal.
As Cardano approaches the end of May 2024, the AI-predicted slight price increase offers a beacon of optimism in a largely bearish market environment.
Investors and stakeholders should monitor these developments closely, as the upcoming network upgrades could provide the catalyst needed for more substantial gains.

Buy signal for two strong cryptocurrencies this week


The cryptocurrency market is heating up after weeks of uncertainties and significant losses. Amid a potential recovery, two cryptocurrencies stand out with notable strong momentum.
In early May, leveraged long-position traders lost $400 million in 24 hours due to market liquidations. This movement followed four weeks of either losses or neutral price action among decentralized finance (DeFi) assets.
Finbold then recurred to the Relative Strength Index (RSI) heatmap from CoinGlass on May 7 to spot potential buy signals. 


Overall, the average weekly RSI shows a neutral-50 landscape that could lead these assets in any direction. On the other hand, the average daily RSI navigates at 45 index points as a result of last week’s turmoil.
Buy signal: Near Protocol (NEAR)
In this context, Near Protocol (NEAR) has an interesting setup: a strong weekly RSI of 67.86 points and a strengthening daily RSI of 59.93, which is on the verge of the ‘strong’ level—at 60 index points.
As of this writing, NEAR trades at $7.48, with a neutral performance in the last 24 hours. Notably, the Near Protocol is one of the most promising Web3 infrastructures in the crypto landscape.

If it passes the 60 index points, the promising Web3-native token will be the second strongest cryptocurrency in the 24-hour time frame among the cryptocurrencies with the largest capitalization. Crypto traders and investors could see this gain in momentum as a buy signal for NEAR this week.
Strong momentum for the Render Network (RNDR)
Currently, the strongest cryptocurrency is Render Network (RNDR), according to CoinGlass‘s daily heatmap. RNDR was trading at $10.50 by press time, up 5.27% in the last 24 hours. Moreover, the token has a 65.5 daily RSI and promising fundamentals for its protocol.
Similarly, the weekly RSI also shows a strong momentum with the same 65 points, suggesting an uptrend continuation.

However, the market is volatile, and things can change quickly despite the potential buy signal for these two strong cryptocurrencies. Still, this selection has a long-term potential even if the short-term projection is not fulfilled. This is why cryptocurrency investors must do their due diligence and seek solid projects for solid capital allocation.

Ethena (ENA) Price Jumps as Bybit Endorses USDe Token as Collateral for Crypto Derivatives Trading

The protocol's USDe token, often referred to as "synthetic dollar" instead of a stablecoin, is a structured finance product wrapped in a token. It offers steady yields to investors by using ETH liquid staking derivatives such as Lido's stETH as backing assets, pairing them with an equal value of short ETH perpetual futures position on derivatives exchanges to keep anchored at $1 price. This strategy is also known as a "cash and carry" trade, which harvests derivatives funding rates for a yield.

Standard Chartered predicts Bitcoin boost from Trump re-election - Crypto Briefing




The prospect of Donald Trump returning to office after the US presidential election in November could be a positive catalyst for Bitcoin’s value, said Standard Chartered in a report on Tuesday. The bank suggests a Trump election victory could lead to a more crypto-friendly regulatory landscape.“We think that a second Trump administration would be broadly positive via a more supportive regulatory environment,” the report stated.Donald Trump’s relationship with cryptocurrency has been marked by longstanding skepticism. He previously described Bitcoin as ‘a scam,’ voicing concerns about its potential to compete with the US dollar. However, Trump’s recent remarks indicate a shift from his previously dismissive attitude toward Bitcoin to a more nuanced perspective. In a February interview with Fox News, he acknowledged Bitcoin’s growing popularity and its increasing use as a currency.Additionally, Standard Chartered believes the risk of the US government printing money to pay its debts is increasing. This could weaken the US dollar, and in this scenario, Bitcoin could act as a hedge against de-dollarization and waning confidence in the US Treasury market.“In a scenario of U.S. fiscal dominance, we think bitcoin (BTC) would provide a good hedge against de-dollarization and declining confidence in the U.S. Treasury market,” analyst Geoff Kendrick noted.Kendrick added that Bitcoin could benefit from three potential outcomes of US fiscal dominance: “a steeper nominal 2-year/10-year Treasury curve, a larger rise in breakevens than real yields, and an increase in the term premium.”In other words, inflation expectations would rise faster than actual interest rates due to concerns about increased government spending. Investors worried about inflation and the value of the US dollar might seek alternative assets like Bitcoin.Kendrick suggested a Trump re-election could lead to faster selling of US Treasury bonds by foreign investors due to concerns about US government finances.“In addition to the passive boost to BTC from de-dollarization, we would expect a second Trump administration to be actively supportive of BTC (and digital assets more broadly) via looser regulation and the approval of U.S. spot ETFs,” the report stated.Regarding Bitcoin’s price targets, the bank maintains its prediction that Bitcoin will reach $150,000 by the end of 2024 and $200,000 by the end of 2025.

Arthur Hayes Says Bitcoin Has Bottomed: When Will $70,000 Be Reclaimed? - Benzinga

CEO of BitMEX, Arthur Hayes has a long history within the cryptocurrency industry. Hayes graduated from the Wharton School of Business at the University of Pennsylvania. He began working as an equity derivatives trader in 2008. In 2014, he founded BitMEX, the leading cryptocurrency derivatives platform. Hayes posted on the BitMEX blog to discuss the current state of Bitcoin and where he sees the price going in the future. In particular, he focuses on the Federal Reserve and Republic First Bank.Don't Miss:The Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) recently announced that they would be lowering the rate of quantitative tightening (QT) from $95 billion a month to $60 million a month. This means that they will be selling fewer financial instruments on the open market each month. Through this, they can lower the interest rates and provide some stimulus to the economy. Hayes goes on to note that in previous months, the FOMC has undershot the $95 billion QT quota, so there is potential for them to undershoot the $60 billion quota. According to Hayes, this is positive for U.S. Dollar liquidity and, in turn, Bitcoin.Another potential positive for Bitcoin is the collapse of First Republic Bank. The Fulton Bank purchased it in late April 2024, and the FDIC approved it as "the least costly resolution for the DIF." Essentially, the acquisition was the outcome that allowed the FDIC to spend the least amount of money on deposit insurance. Trending: According to Cathie Wood, holding 6 Ethereum (ETH) could make you a millionaire, here’s why it can be true.However, as Hayes points out, the FDIC covered more deposits than was required by law. The FDIC only insures deposits up to $250,000. However, with the First Republic, the FDIC gave Fulton Bank the necessary cash to fully insure all depository accounts. According to Hayes, allowing any deposits to go uninsured "is politically unpalatable in an election year, especially if the powers that be have continuously assured the public the banking system is sound." So, the move essentially set a precedent for fully insuring deposits.If more banks fail, this precedent would inevitably lead to more money printing, as the FDIC would have to borrow from the Fed to satisfy all deposits. To some, this could be seen as reckless, giving more value to Bitcoin's consistent and predictable supply. To end the post, Hayes summarizes his position in three points:
Bitcoin hit a low at $58,600.



Bitcoin will be rangebound between $60,000 and $70,000 until August



The Fed and FDIC are stealthily printing money, giving more validity to Bitcoin
So, with some evidence from macro policy and recent events in the banking sphere, Hayes believes that there is room for Bitcoin to go up in the coming months as the effects of recent moves begin to realize. Read Next:

                        In the latest Solana meme coin pump, the new cat-themed coin ‘Aqua Cat on SOL’ (AQUACAT) has seen its price skyrocket by 33,895% overnight, as traders around the world try to get a piece of the pie.This article will provide an analysis of AQUACAT’s current price trends and look to see whether a soon-to-launch meme coin, DOGEVERSE, represents a more promising investment opportunity at this time.Aquacat is unique among cat coins because it’s not exactly a cat. It’s a lovable sea-otter coin masquerading as a cat as he rides the waves of success in the high-octane Solana meme coin market.AQUACAT Price Analysis: Can New Solana Meme Coin Dominate The Cat Coin Vertical Like POPCAT?
As price action mounts a well-defended consolidation move, Aquacat on SOL is currently trading at a market price of $0.000910 (representing a 24-hour change of +24%).This comes after AQUACAT launched at just 17:00 UTC on May 5, before mounting a multi-day +338,000% climb to hit an all-time high of $0.00134 at 13:00 UTC on May 6.In the 24 hours since, price action has remained in consolidation, in a well-defended range between support at $0.0007 and resistance at $0.0012.Meanwhile, markets remain highly indecisive – with buy-sell pressure completely equalized, representing 50% of transactions each over the past day.Indeed, glancing at the RSI, price action has failed to cool off below minor bearish divergence despite the consolidation – suggesting a dip lower could form the lynchpin of the next upside move.With a current market cap at $891k, current price levels represent a relatively alluring entry, with the potential 100x move on the cards if the project is able to sustain and grow like POPCAT.But while AQUACAT marks an alluring entry for cat-lovers, more respectable dog-loving traders should look no further than the emerging dog-coin DOGVERSE.Forget Aquacat on SOL – Could This Dog Coin Presales Offer Better Meme Coin Play?

While AQUACAT is the viral token de jour in Cat Coins, Dogeverse is gearing up to be the next big thing for the Dog Coin vertical.Think of this as a time machine ticket to AQUACAT token’s first hour of trading, with all the early adopter bragging rights included.Built on Solana, and deployed on multi-chain launch, the DOGEVERSE presale recently smashed $13m in funds raised – with a limited number of tokens remaining to purchase ahead of an A-list lineup of CEX launches.Being the first multi-chain DOGE incarnation, DOGEVERSE aims to become a top meme coin on Solana quickly.

Bitcoin: the tax domain of the USA and the possible victory of Trump

Standard Chartered argues that an electoral victory by Trump could have a positive impact on digital assets and Bitcoin, as well as the fiscal dominance of the United States (USA) and the increasing monetization of public debt. 
Investors may therefore turn to alternative assets such as cryptocurrencies to mitigate the risks associated with the above. 
The bank also confirms its price forecasts for Bitcoin, setting them at $150,000 by the end of the year and $200,000 by the end of 2025. Let’s see all the details below. 

US Tax Domain: an advantage for Bitcoin, could Trump favor crypto?
As anticipated, the risk of an increasing fiscal dominance by the United States, accompanied by the monetization of public debt by the Federal Reserve, is rising. 
This situation could favor cryptocurrencies, as investors seek alternatives, said Standard Chartered in a research report on Tuesday. Additionally, Donald Trump could be an advantage for cryptocurrencies.
Specifically, in the report the analyst Geoff Kendrick states the following: 
“We believe that a second term for Trump would be largely positive, thanks to a more favorable regulatory environment. In a context of US fiscal dominance, we think that Bitcoin (BTC) represents a good hedge against de-dollarization and loss of confidence in US Treasuries.”
The US tax domain could have three main effects on the Treasury curve. A steeper 2-year/10-year curve, a greater increase in breakevens compared to real yields, and an increase in term premium. 
According to Kendrick, the price of Bitcoin is positively correlated with all three of these potential developments.
If Trump were to win the election, his second term could accelerate the withdrawal of foreign official investors from the US Treasury market. This is due to fears related to taxation.
During his first term, the average annual net sale of US public debt was $207 billion, compared to $55 billion during President Biden’s presidency.
“In addition to the passive push to BTC due to de-dollarization, we would expect a second term of Trump to actively support BTC (and digital assets in general) through more flexible regulation and approval of US spot ETFs.”
Finally, Standard Chartered has reiterated its forecasts for Bitcoin price, setting them at $150,000 by the end of this year and $200,000 by the end of 2025.
Michael Saylor: Bitcoin is the only ‘steel’ among cryptocurrency metals
In an interview with journalist Natalie Brunell, Michael Saylor, CEO and co-founder of MicroStrategy, outlined his vision on the future price of Bitcoin. 
According to Saylor, January 2024 marked the beginning of the adoption of Bitcoin by companies. A change linked to the regulatory framework and the distinctive path that Bitcoin is tracing compared to other digital assets.
The main catalyst for the future of Bitcoin, says Saylor, will be the approval by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) of spot Bitcoin ETFs.
This regulatory recognition would legitimize Bitcoin in the eyes of institutional investors and increase its attractiveness as a corporate treasury asset.
Saylor also emphasized that the real turning point will be when the SEC rejects all other requests for spot cryptocurrency ETFs other than Bitcoin. 
This would position Bitcoin as the only safe and distinctive choice among cryptocurrencies, dispelling doubts about its long-term uniqueness. Its metaphor on how Bitcoin compares to other cryptocurrencies is clear: 
“Once one realizes that there is only steel and not a second-rate metal for structural civil engineering, the project moves forward.” 
Bitcoin, in this vision, is the steel, the fundamental and irreplaceable material.
This narrative takes on particular importance in light of the SEC’s upcoming decision on the Ethereum spot ETF, scheduled for May 23, 2024. 
The senior ETF analyst at Bloomberg, Eric Balchunas, has reported a decrease in the likelihood of approval, which could further solidify Bitcoin’s position as the only cryptocurrency recognized at an institutional level.

'Big Short' Investor Steve Eisman Says Crypto One of Three ‘Great Themes of Our Time’ - Here’s What He Means - The Daily Hodl


								One of the investors who called and profited off the subprime mortgage collapse of 2008 says crypto is currently one of three major themes driving today’s narrative – but he still isn’t a fan of it.
In a new interview on Bloomberg Television, Steve Eisman of Neuberger Berman says that artificial intelligence (AI), infrastructure, and crypto.










While he gets the first two themes, Eisman says he doesn’t believe in crypto.
According to the investor, digital assets have a thesis of being a hedge against inflation and fiat currencies, but then contradict it with their correlation with risk assets and the Nasdaq.
“Let’s ask the people who own crypto. Why do they own it? They all say the same thing thing. They say… It’s a hedge against the demise of fiat currency. Cats and dogs will one day lie together, you’ll be in a cave but at least you’ll have your crypto. It’s like digital gold, that’s the thesis. 
Okay, let’s take them at their word. So if that’s the thesis, then on days where everybody’s worried about inflation, they’re worried about the deficit, the Nasdaq is down 300 points and interest rates are up, crypto should be up. 
And on days where everybody’s feeling great, NVDIA’s up, and Nasdaq is up and rates are down and nobody cares about inflation, crypto should be down. And does it act that way? It does not. It acts exactly the opposite of its own thesis. Its correlation to Nasdaq is like 75%. 
So to me, it’s just another way for people to speculate on speculating. There’s no data point of research that says it is right says that it is wrong.”

Coinbase Boss Wants Pro-Crypto Officials to End SEC Sting - DailyCoin


        
Robinhood is the latest victim of the regulatory “war on crypto.”



Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong pushed political activism as the long-term solution to regulatory overreach.



Robinhood CEO Vlad Tenov remained defiant in the face of pending enforcement action. 
The crypto industry faces an intensifying campaign of enforcement actions from regulators, who claim large swaths of the sector are operating in violation of the law. Such claims include allegations of improper disclosures and the pushing of unregistered securities products. 
The latest company caught in the Securities Exchange Commission’s (SEC) crosshairs is the retail trading app Robinhood, which received a Wells Notice recently. Chiming into the situation, Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong welcomed Robinhood to the “club” of crypto firms battling the regulator. However, Armstrong believes the long-term solution to regulator hostility is supporting pro-crypto politicians.Coinbase CEO Looks to PoliticsIn response to Robinhood’s run-in with the SEC, Armstrong expressed confidence that the court system will ultimately side with crypto firms. However, he argued that the long-term solution requires crypto stakeholders to actively support pro-industry political candidates to decisively end regulatory overreach stifling innovation.Pushing the political solution, Armstrong urged individuals to back groups like FairShake, a political action committee supporting pro-crypto politicians, and Stand With Crypto, an advocacy nonprofit mobilizing grassroots support with over 400,000 members who have raised over $86 million to advance the cause.A key initiative of Stand With Crypto is encouraging individuals to directly lobby their representatives to support legislation such as Fit21, a bill to establish a legal framework for digital assets, including transferring the crypto industry’s regulatory authority to the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC). 
Beyond calling and emailing Congress members, the group also recommended that citizens donate funds and raise public awareness about the industry’s plight at the hands of overzealous, hostile regulators.Robinhood Under the CoshReacting to the perceived hostility of a Wells Notice, Robinhood CEO Vlad Tenev struck a defiant tone, calling it “yet another improper attempt by the administrative state to stifle innovation.” Tenev signaled a willingness to take on the SEC in court to establish regulatory clarity.Robinhood’s crypto division received the Wells Notice on May 4, which detailed allegations of violating Sections 15(a) and 17A of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Section 15(a) refers to appropriate registration with the SEC, while 17A relates to rules governing the clearance, settlement, and record-keeping of securities transactions to safeguard customer assets and funds during the trading process.On the Flipside
The CFTC should not be regarded as a soft touch compared to the SEC.



KuCoin and Binance have been charged by the CFTC for operating illegal derivatives exchanges.



Lawmakers have struggled to find bipartisan agreement on comprehensive crypto regulations.
Why This MattersUnclear rules and regulations by enforcement lead many to believe the US crypto industry is the victim of underhand practices. With the future of US innovation at risk, the stakes have never been higher.Bitcoin maxi Michael Saylor cheers for enforcement action against altcoins:Michael Saylor Warns SEC to Flag ETH, ADA, SOL as SecuritiesEmurgo teams up with GSR Markets to boost the Cardano ecosystem:Stuttering Cardano Handed Lifeline Under New Emurgo Deal

New South Korean leadership will press for BTC ETF trading

The Democratic Party of Korea will request that the Financial Services Commission (FSC) reconsider its interpretation of the legal status of spot Bitcoin (BTC) exchange-traded funds (ETFs), according to a local press report. Allowing spot ETFs with underlying virtual assets was one of the party’s campaign promises.An unnamed official of the Democratic Party policy committee told The Korea Economic Daily that the party would make the request after the opening of the National Assembly in June. The opposition party was swept into power in the April elections in South Korea and holds 175 of 300 seats in the legislative body.The FSC issued a statement on Jan. 12 saying domestic securities firms could violate the Capital Markets Act by listing foreign spot BTC ETFs. The United States Securities and Exchange Commission approved spot BTC ETF trading on Jan. 10. The South Korean financial regulator’s position was not well received. The previous presidential administration urged the FSC to reconsider its decision on Jan. 18.

Trump Defeating Biden Would Be Good for Bitcoin: Standard Chartered - Decrypt

Subscribe now to Alpha Reports and up your game!Go to Alpha ReportsDonald Trump used to be anti-crypto. But if he wins in November and becomes United States President for a second term, Bitcoin could benefit, according to British banking giant Standard Chartered. In a Tuesday note, Standard Chartered digital assets researcher Geoffrey Kendrick said that another Trump administration would not be as strict on Bitcoin as a Biden one might be.And if Trump wins, then foreign official buyers of U.S. treasuries may want to shift to alternative financial assets like Bitcoin out of caution, he added—which would push the asset’s price up. “While officials in the Biden administration have taken a relatively tough stance on digital assets, Trump said in a March interview that if elected, he would not crack down on Bitcoin or other digital assets,” the note reads.It adds that import tariffs under a Trump presidency would lead “several large reserve managers to be buying BTC in 2025.” Back in March, Trump—who previously slammed Bitcoin—said he’d enjoyed making money and playing around with the asset and other cryptocurrencies. “I make money with it, I have fun with it too,” he said. “Crazy new currencies, that’s what I call them. They’re crazy new currencies, whether it’s Bitcoin or others.”Donald Trump—who was U.S. President from 2017-2021—will likely go head-to-head against current president Joe Biden as the presumptive Republican candidate in the November elections.Standard Chartered last month predicted that the newly approved Bitcoin exchange-traded funds ETFs will continue to be popular, and inflows could lead the price of Bitcoin to rocket to $150,000 by the end of this year.Edited by Andrew HaywardStay on top of crypto news, get daily updates in your inbox.

Bloomberg’s Mike McGlone Reveals Why A $150,000 Bitcoin Price Target Is Far Off


                            Mike McGlone, Senior commodity strategist at Bloomberg Intelligence, has made a rather pessimistic prediction for Bitcoin, emphasizing that the cryptocurrency’s potential rise to $150,00 was a long shot. The strategist has revealed factors that could make Bitcoin’s projected surge to $150,000 difficult, highlighting both macroeconomic trends and Bitcoin’s performance in 2024. 
Bitcoin Surge To $150,000 Unlikely
In a recent interview with Scott Melker, the host of “The Wolf Of All Streets,” podcast, McGlone discussed Bitcoin’s price fundamentals and its possible rise to $150,000 in the 2024 bull cycle. 

Comparing Bitcoin with the stock market index, the S&P 500, the Bloomberg strategist disclosed that the cryptocurrency was currently showing “divergent weakness,” highlighting that Bitcoin’s performance against the S&P 500 in 2021 was greater compared to 2024. 
He also revealed that Bitcoin was displaying a similar weak performance to Gold, emphasizing current market conditions and the risk of short-term deflation in the financial market. 
The combination of these factors pushes McGlone to believe that Bitcoin’s short-term projected rise to $150,000 was unlikely. 
While the Bloomberg strategist made his foreboding prediction despite Bitcoin’s overperformance at the beginning of the year, McGlone still remains optimistic about the cryptocurrency’s price and fundamental value in the long term. 
Co-founder and CEO of CoinRoutes, Dave Weisberger, who was also in the podcast with McGlone, made a more optimistic prediction for Bitcoin. Basing his analysis on historical trends and patterns as far back as 2015, Weisberger forecasted that Bitcoin could rise to $200,000 this cycle. 
His forecast is also acknowledged by reformed hedge fund manager, James Lavish, who revealed in the podcast that Spot Bitcoin ETFs could become a potential driver for Bitcoin’s continuous growth. This is attributed to the massive impact Bitcoin ETFs had on the cryptocurrency’s price following its launch on January 11, 2024. 
After Spot Bitcoin ETFs were successfully released into the market, the price of Bitcoin skyrocketed to new all-time highs above $73,000. At the time of writing, the cryptocurrency is trading at $63,778, marking a 0.89% increase over the past seven days, according to CoinMarketCap. 
BTC Crash Presents Perfect Opportunity
According to Lavish, if Bitcoin crashes down to the $30,000 to $40,000 range, it would present a “tremendous opportunity” for investors to acquire substantial value in a long-term asset that will essentially hold its value and continue to appreciate in the future. 

The reformed hedge fund manager revealed that Bitcoin’s short-term volatility and market unpredictability could produce long-term capture of value. This suggests that by strategically navigating through the price fluctuations of Bitcoin, investors could potentially capitalize on its volatility to accumulate wealth over time, which in turn could favorably impact the price of the cryptocurrency.

Cardano Set For Expansion: EMURGO And GSR Join Forces


								EMURGO, the commercial arm of the Cardano blockchain, has formed a strategic alliance with GSR, a prominent global cryptocurrency trading firm. This partnership aims to bolster the infrastructure of the ecosystem by leveraging GSR’s expertise in market liquidity and financial services.
How The Partnership Will Boost Cardano
EMURGO, established in 2015, plays a critical role in driving the adoption and implementation of the Cardano blockchain. The collaboration with GSR is intended to address several key areas within the network.
First, GSR will bring its extensive experience in market-making to provide deeper liquidity for Cardano’s native token and other Cardano-based digital assets. This move is expected to reduce slippage and improve transaction efficiency on decentralized exchanges operating within the Cardano ecosystem.
The partnership will scout and support burgeoning projects through venture investments within the network, aiming to fuel innovative developments and accelerate commercial applications built on Cardano. By enhancing the interoperability of applications, the collaboration also seeks to simplify user interactions and integrate services across the blockchain, thus broadening user engagement and adoption.

Moreover, both entities are committed to advancing blockchain knowledge through joint educational programs focused on ADA’s technology, which will aim to attract more developers and businesses to the ecosystem.
Ken Kodama, CEO of EMURGO, highlighted the strategic benefits of the alliance, stating, “EMURGO is excited to work with GSR and utilize its established track record as one of the largest market makers in the crypto space to support the growing ecosystem. GSR’s wealth of experience, expertise, and deep resources will enable builders and projects to develop and scale their Web3 products to potential Web3 users while fostering an even more robust Cardano ecosystem moving forward.”

Echoing the sentiment, CJ Fong, Head of EMEA Business Development at GSR, noted, “GSR is thrilled to be working with the EMURGO team as they continue to expand their ecosystem. We look forward to supporting the next phase of growth through unique investment opportunities and education initiatives within the Cardano community.”
This partnership comes at a pivotal time for GSR as well, with its Singapore subsidiary, GSR Markets Pte. Ltd., securing the Digital Payment Token Service license from the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS). This is a notable milestone as it marks the first such license granted to a digital asset market maker in the region, potentially setting a precedent for regulatory acceptance of digital asset firms in Singapore and beyond.
Cardano itself is known for its foundation in peer-reviewed research and a scientific development methodology. With a commitment to environmental sustainability and security through its proof-of-stake protocol, the blockchain has successfully processed nearly 90 million transactions. The platform currently supports over 1,350 projects, varying from financial applications to complex decentralized applications (dApps).
At press time, ADA traded at $0.45.

                        Following a four-month period of consistent outflows, Grayscale’s spot Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) has finally witnessed a positive shift. Over the past two days, the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) has attracted inflows totaling $66.9 million.This change in tide comes after a major period of decline, during which GBTC saw an average daily outflow of $217 million, amounting to a total of over $17.5 billion since January 11.Turnaround for Grayscale Bitcoin ETFThe initial sign of recovery appeared on May 3, with a $63 million inflow into GBTC, marking the end of the prolonged downward trend.

An additional $3.9 million inflow on May 6 further solidified the positive trend, bringing the total capital influx into GBTC to $66.9 million.Bitcoin ETFs within the U.S. market continue to demonstrate profitability.

US authorities identify and charge Russian mastermind behind LockBit ransomware group - Crypto Briefing




The US Department of Justice (DOJ) has identified Russian national Dmitry Khoroshev as the mastermind behind the notorious LockBit ransomware gang and is offering a $10 million reward for information leading to his arrest.In a 26-count criminal indictment unsealed Tuesday morning, prosecutors allege that Khoroshev, 31, developed, promoted, and oversaw the LockBit software, recruiting “affiliates” on cybercriminal forums who carried out the actual ransomware attacks. Affiliates would give Khoroshev a 20% cut of their earnings, typically paid in bitcoin (BTC), once a ransom was paid.According to prosecutors, LockBit became one of the most prolific ransomware tools in the world between its inception in 2019 and the seizure of most of its infrastructure earlier this year. The gang’s network of affiliates attacked approximately 2,500 victims, 1,800 of which were in the US, and extorted an estimated $500 million in ransom payments.The indictment states that Khoroshev received $100 million in bitcoin disbursements from LockBit’s activities over the course of its operation. US authorities are also seeking forfeiture of his ill-gotten gains.In addition to the criminal charges, Khoroshev has been sanctioned by the US Treasury Department’s Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC), prohibiting all US persons, including future victims of a LockBit ransomware attack, from transacting with him.One Bitcoin address associated with Khoroshev was added to the department’s “Specially Designated Nationals” list. Notably, search results indicate that this address only had two transactions, with the last transaction dated 2021. However, law enforcement actions against LockBit are far from over. In February 2024, the National Crime Agency (NCA) and multinational law enforcement agencies, supported by private sector intelligence, carried out “Operation Cronos,” which dealt a significant blow to LockBit’s operations.The operation resulted in the seizure of LockBit’s dark web sites, hacking infrastructure, source code, and cryptocurrency accounts, as well as the recovery of over 1,000 decryptor keys to help victims recover encrypted data. Two individuals were arrested, and sanctions were levied on Russian LockBit affiliates.According to Chainalysis, they have identified hundreds of active wallets and 2,200 Bitcoin — worth nearly $110 million — in unspent LockBit ransomware proceeds that are yet to be laundered and transferred.Despite the charges and sanctions, Khoroshev remains at large and, according to a March interview with The Record, continues to operate LockBit. Five other LockBit members have been charged with crimes for participating in the criminal operation, with at least one, dual Russian-Canadian national Mikhail Vasiliev, sentenced to prison.Khoroshev faces a total of 26 charges, including conspiracy to commit fraud, extortion, wire fraud, intentional damage to protected computers, and extortion in relation to information unlawfully obtained from protected computers. If convicted, he could face a maximum of 185 years in prison.

This Crypto Analyst Remains 'Turbo Optimistic,' Claims 'We're About 1/3 Through' The Bull Run - Benzinga

Cryptocurrency trader 0xsmac on Tuesday challenged the prevailing notion that the crypto market is nearing the middle or end of its current cycle, pointing instead to a variety of data points to claim that it is still in its early stages.What Happened: “The perception of the cycle being out of order is skewing how people view the market,” writes 0xsmac in a Substack article, referencing the frustration some investors felt by missing out on early gains in assets like Solana. He believes this psychological factor is warping current sentiment.The recent approval of a Bitcoin ETF is a significant development, but 0xsmac emphasizes that access for retail investors through major investment firms, such as wirehouses, hasn’t materialized yet.This vast pool of potential capital remains on the sidelines.0SMAC acknowledges institutional inflows, but states they haven’t reached their full potential yet. He points to 13F filings as evidence that advisors are gradually incorporating Bitcoin BTC/USD ETFs into client portfolios.“Massive new pools of institutional capital now have legitimate access to this asset class,” he explains, suggesting a profound shift in market structure akin to “tectonic plates” in their slow but impactful movement.Despite the influx of institutional money, 0xSmac is keen to point out the continuing relevance of retail investors and newer platforms.Also Read: Binance CEO Calls For Colleague’s Release Amid Standoff With NigeriaHe mentions the recent halving event which reduced Bitcoin supply, and the divergence in Google trend data and Coinbase app store rankings from past bull markets.These indicators suggest a more subdued level of retail frenzy, which could mean that the market is not as overheated as previous cycles.The crypto trader is also not shy about calling out the unpredictability and new developments in the market, particularly with the advent of memecoins and the broader spread of capital across different cryptocurrencies. “This isn't supposed to happen yet,” he reflects on the unexpected market movements, emphasizing the uncharted territory that the market is currently navigating.Looking towards the future, 0xSmac remains “turbo optimistic,” estimating that we are about 1/3 of the way through the current cycle.His narrative suggests that while the market has its complexities, the underlying trends indicate a robust appetite for digital assets, pointing towards a cycle that may still have considerable room to grow.What’s Next: As the market continues to develop, Benzinga’s upcoming Future of Digital Assets event on Nov. 19 will provide a pivotal platform for industry leaders and investors to discuss these trends and their implications for the future of cryptocurrencies.This gathering is timely, offering a space for critical insights and strategic discussions that align with the ongoing evolution of the market as outlined by influential traders like 0xSmac.Read Next: Crypto ‘An Outsized Piece Of The Scams And Problems’ In Markets: Gary GenslerImage: Shutterstock

US sanctions Russian ransomware leader, offers $10M reward


The United States has revealed the supposed leader of crypto-ransomware group LockBit and is offering a $10 million bounty to anyone who can out key leaders from the hacking group. 
The US Treasury Department outed Dmitry Yuryevich Khoroshev as the primary leader of Russia-based LockBit in a sanction issued today. 
According to US authorities, Khoroshev is behind the ‘LockBitSupp’ moniker and helped upgrade and manage LockBit. It also shared his Bitcoin crypto address: bc1qvhnfknw852ephxyc5hm4q520zmvf9maphetc9z.
Malware-focused account vx-underground, however, claims that LockBit issued a statement to the FBI that reads, “The FBI is bluffing, I’m not Dimon, I feel sorry for the real Dimon))) oh, and he’ll get fucked for my sins))).”
Vx-Underground additionally reports that Khoroshev’s information, including his address and food order history, was exposed, and that he has a fondness for Cheesecake Factory. 
Today’s US sanction included a $10 million reward to anyone with information that may reveal the identity of LockBit’s key leaders. In addition, the government is offering $5 million to anyone with information that can lead to the arrest of anyone involved with LockBit ransomware.

What is LockBit?
LockBit runs a ransomware-as-a-service model that generates funds by licensing its ransomware tools to fellow cybercriminals while taking a cut of their exploits. 
The US states, “[LockBit] has targeted over 2,500 victims worldwide and is alleged to have received more than $500 million in ransom payments,” while attacking “financial services, food and agriculture, education, emergency services, and healthcare.” 
Last February, 200 crypto addresses linked to LockBit were frozen, and its site was seized by authorities, including the FBI, Europol, and the UK National Crime Agency.  
In the same month, authorities teased the announcement of LockBit’s leader and left users a little underwhelmed when its announcement revealed little more than a cartoon cat and the car he drove.

The most important trend in crypto? It’s always been memecoins - Blockworks


Forget the halving. Don’t mention ETFs. What then is arguably the most important narrative in crypto?
Memecoins.
Yes, that often-cringeworthy menagerie of anime, animalia and animations collectively are the primary on-ramp into crypto for new users. People are always asking, “Where are the next billion users going to come from?” 
The answer is pretty clear — the only remaining question is whether the dog will be wearing a hat or not.
Before fans of self-custody, real-world assets and DeFi (and I’m certainly among them) turn up their noses in disdain, let’s consider some of the very valid reasons for the persistent popularity of memecoins and their kissing cousin, airdrops.
First up is entertainment. People love to be entertained, and they don’t mind spending money on it. The global entertainment and media market is valued at well over $2 trillion, according to analysts from PwC, on par with the overall market cap for all cryptocurrencies. What’s the utility of $DOGE, $PEPE or $BONK, compared to governance tokens or stablecoins? Entertainment in itself is a utility.
People are also attracted to risk. The global casino industry alone is worth more than $150 billion and is growing, according to a ResearchAndMarkets.com report. That doesn’t include sports betting, lotteries or all the other ways that people put down relatively small amounts of money in hopes of winning relatively large amounts of money. (In investment lingo, “asymmetric opportunities.”) Obviously, buying a memecoin carries a lot of this type of risk, but putting in time, resources and energy into a potential airdrop event — where the amount and timing of the reward is uncertain — is an experience undeniably tinged with the thrill of the gamble as well.
Read more from our opinion section: Memecoin mania can teach us something
Organizations and builders support memecoins and airdrops because they can bring liquidity to an ecosystem. They also help capture slices of the exceedingly precious “attention economy,” whose value economists estimate to be in the “trillions of dollars.” It can be argued that the $BONK airdrop and community campaign were the lighter and lighter fluid that reignited the Solana ecosystem. Or just look at how Ordinals and now Runes have turned Bitcoin into a blistering hot network, as opposed to a passive digital-gold-like store of value.
In my position as head of marketing for Moonbeam (which integrates the Ethereum and Polkadot ecosystems), I’ve had a front-row seat for the recent launch of a memecoin on our network and the concomitant entertainment, risk and attention.
Based on my experience, I can attest that admittedly silly memecoins can have seriously positive effects on a network level. New users are attracted by the entertainment value and potential for airdrops. Cross-chain synergies are fostered with other ecosystems where the memecoin has also been launched. And networks that are able to secure a supply of the memecoin can direct those resources to targeted growth areas in strategic areas, in our case, DeFi, gaming, real-world assets, DePIN, AI and more.
But while memecoins are sweet and all, here’s the bitter pill: Besides memecoins, we in crypto have largely created a very bad, very difficult system from a user experience perspective.
Gambling and lotteries comprise the dark side of the traditional financial system, but at least it’s an easy way of participating in the financial system. Memecoins play a similar role in crypto and DeFi — they’re the best on-ramp we’ve got. 
If buying $DOGE or the latest Solana microcap leads someone to exploring the broader crypto ecosystem, then it’s a win for everyone who believes in the democratizing potential of blockchain technology and governance.
But if the rest of the crypto ecosystem provides such a poor user experience — or is not perceived as useful by the new memecoin holders — then this year’s nascent bull run will turn out to be another playing-card structure, doomed again to collapse when the bubble pops or macroeconomic conditions next convulse.
Memecoins are hot again — for the moment. It’s now time for “serious” builders to demonstrate real value for new users and capitalize on the attention that dog coins have fetched, because there’s no guarantee they’ll last through the next cycle.

Stuttering Cardano Handed Lifeline Under New Emurgo Deal - DailyCoin


        
Cardano has lost its shine in recent months.



Emurgo teams up with GSR markets to address multiple issues.



ADA price action is stagnant.
Cardano has struggled to keep pace with competing chains in recent months, slipping down in the market cap rankings and facing criticism for its lack of mass market appeal.  
However, in a bid to recapture the buzz of the past, Emurgo has secured a major partnership with GSR Markets. The global crypto trading firm will provide liquidity and participate in growth opportunities within the Cardano ecosystem.Cardano Ecosystem Gets Major BoostAttempting to reinvigorate the Cardano ecosystem, GSR Markets is tasked with market-making services for additional liquidity and identifying and participating in growth opportunities to expand Cardano’s reach.Market makers like GSR play a vital role by buying and selling tokens. This process provides the liquidity necessary to ensure a free-flowing market without major price disparities or illiquidity issues. The growth opportunities GSR will pursue include evaluating investment prospects in promising Cardano-based projects, collaborating on initiatives to improve interoperability between Cardano and other blockchains, as well as promoting educational content to onboard more users and developers to the ecosystem.Commenting on the partnership, CJ Fong, head of EMEA business development at GSR Markets, stated that the firm is pleased to support Cardano as it seeks “the next phase of growth through unique investment opportunities.”
Aside from Fong’s optimism for the future, ADA has faced considerable price weakness in recent months.ADA StrugglesCardano’s native token ADA has faced challenges in reclaiming its $0.81 yearly high, achieved on March 14. Following this peak, ADA has experienced a significant decline, dropping by 50% to a new yearly low of $0.401 by April 13. Since hitting this low point, the token has ranged between $0.422 and $0.523, with few signs of breaking this slump.ADAUSD daily chart on Trading ViewMany see this lackluster price action as symbolic of Cardano’s wider issues in recent months. Observers have attributed the project’s struggles to a range of problems, including poor marketing efforts that have failed to attract mainstream attention and strong competition from rival blockchains.Last month saw TON surpass Cardano to claim the ninth spot by market cap rankings. TON recently rolled out its “proof-of-personhood” protocol, enticing Telegram users to exchange palm prints for TON tokens. Moreover, the project gained a substantial edge following the addition of major stablecoin provider Tether into its ecosystem.On the Flipside
Cardano was a top 3 token until the end of September 2021.



The total value locked (TVL) in Cardano DeFi is $388 million, ranking the chain 20th by TVL, behind chains such as Ultron, Hyperliquid, and Pulsechain.
Why This MattersCardano’s unfulfilled potential and slipping market cap ranking are the result of multiple issues. It is unlikely that the influence of GSR Markets alone can turn this situation around. Cardano holders have their say in a potential BCH tie-in.Cardano’s Hoskinson Gauges Bitcoin Cash Integration With PollBluesky’s future is in doubt as Jack Dorsey leaves.Jack Dorsey Ditching Bluesky Fosters Censorship Tech Rumors

Sui Network Addresses Token Supply Concerns, Asserts Transparency and Third-Party Oversight

In a statement posted on X, the layer-1 blockchain asserted the integrity of its tokenomics and highlighted the involvement of reputable third parties in token storage and management.




According to Sui, tokens are released according to a predetermined schedule and are easily accessible to the public. 



It emphasized that neither its founders nor the Sui Foundation can control the treasury or tokens allocated to investors, including those in the community reserve. 



The Sui Foundation manages the primary wallet housing locked tokens, which are released under specific conditions to support various projects such as Move programming language development, network security enhancements, hackathons, and developer grants.

Addressing concerns raised by Justin Bons from Cyber Capital, who highlighted potential centralization risks due to the team’s token holdings, Sui disputed these claims. 



It asserted compliance with legal and regulatory standards overseen by reputable custodial service providers like BitGo, Anchorage, and Coinbase Prime, ensuring transparency and accountability.



Bons, however, challenged Sui to provide evidence demonstrating that founders cannot move or access allocated tokens, arguing that true transparency requires irrefutable proof of secure token holdings. 




He cautioned against misrepresenting token status, which could undermine transparency claims.



In a separate development, in September 2023, the Sui Network streamlined Web3 logins for users on its apps, offering zero knowledge login options via platforms like Google, Facebook, and Twitch. 



Renowned for its ability to handle high transaction volumes while maintaining low fees since its inception, the network continues to innovate in the realm of blockchain technology.

Getting Started with Sanctum Wonderland | Bankless


Okay, so you’ve got some SOL in your wallet – what is there to do with it? Liquid staking is becoming a more popular option; this entails staking your SOL to a staking pool rather than directly to the Solana network. In doing so, you receive a token representing your staked SOL, i.e. a Liquid Staking Token (LST).The beauty of this approach? Liquidity and passive income. With an LST you retain a liquid version of staked SOL, which you can borrow against or trade with as you please, while still earning Solana staking rewards from your underlying pool position. And just like on Ethereum, there is now a wide range of LST offerings on Solana, like Jupiter’s jupSOL, BONK’s bonkSOL, Helium’s hSOL, and beyond. The APY of these Solana LSTs has been in the ballpark of 7-10% lately, which is attractive on its own. Sanctum has been garnering attention for its Wonderland rewards initiative which takes things a step further, letting you put your SOL LSTs to work in an additional rewards program for a potential airdrop with just a few clicks.Sanctum is a liquid staking platform on Solana that’s gunning to become base command for users of SOL LSTs. Currently, the Sanctum web app’s main products include:Infinity — For depositing LSTs or SOL into Sanctum’s premier offering, the Infinity Pool, to receive yield-bearing Infinity (INF) tokensTrade — For quickly swapping into or out of any of Sanctum’s allowlisted LSTsStake Accounts — For transforming regular SOL stake accounts into LSTsLSTs — For finding and learning more about the LSTs that Sanctum supportsThese are all useful in and of themselves, but where things really get interesting is with Sanctum’s new Wonderland rewards program.The name of the game with Sanctum is collecting Pets, which you acquire and level up with EXP points by holding allowlisted LSTs, each of which has its own unique Pet. Once you join Wonderland, you acquire a Pet simply by owning a minimum of 0.1 worth of the associated LST, and you earn 10 EXP every minute per 1 SOL’s worth of supported LSTs that you hold. Evolutions will launch soon, and each Pet can undergo three evolutions on the road to the maximum possible level of 999. It will also be possible to earn EXP multipliers by completing upcoming Community Quests.All that said, Wonderland is a light and fun way to get involved with SOL LSTs, and it’s safe to assume that participation will factor into a future airdrop if Sanctum ever launches a native governance token. Interested in diving in? It’s super easy: head to app.sanctum.so/wonderland, connect your Solana wallet of choice, and follow through with the instructions in the ensuing pop-up to finish up. That’s all it takes!But remember, you’ll need to hold at least 0.1 SOL’s worth of an eligible LST to start racking up points. If you still need to acquire some, the fastest avenue is Sanctum’s Trade hub. After you swap into your token of choice, you’ll automatically start accruing EXP. Also, keep in mind that once enlisted in Wonderland you’ll be given a referral code and you’ll earn 5% of any EXP earned by people you refer. You can also earn Referral Cupcakes, which will be exchangeable for bonus EXP later. Looking ahead, Sanctum is aiming to run the Wonderland campaign for the long-term across multiple seasons, adding new partnerships and quests all the while. As such, Season 1 is a chance to get eligibility in early on what may pan out to be a lucrative Solana airdrop!

Here's How Much $1,000 Invested In Dogecoin Would be Worth If You Invested When Elon Musk First Tweeted About DOGE - Benzinga

Over five years ago, Elon Musk first posted about Dogecoin (DOGE) on social media. Since then, the token has exploded in popularity, reaching all corners of the internet and generating tens of billions in investment. The first posts about DOGE seemingly came out of nowhere but had a huge impact on the price. Let's take a look at what would have happened if you had the foresight to invest when Musk first tweeted about DOGE.Don't Miss:On April 2, 2019, Musk posted on X, saying "Dogecoin might be my fav cryptocurrency. It's pretty cool." To this day, the post only has 11,0000 likes, a small fraction of the hundreds of thousands that Musk regularly receives in 2024. However, this small and innocent post would spark a memecoin revolution. At the time of the tweet, DOGE was worth around $0.003, or less than 1/30 of one cent. However, at highs in May 2021, the price of DOGE reached $0.7376. This marked an increase of nearly 24,500% in just over two years. So, if you invested $1,000 in DOGE on April 2, 2019, it would have been worth $245,860 at highs in 2021. The price of DOGE has since fallen to around $0.16. However, this is still an increase of over 5,000% from the first tweet from Musk, and an investment of $1,000 would currently be worth over $50,000. This marks a compounded annual growth rate (CAGR) of over 120%. Trending: Dogecoin millionaires are increasing — investors with $1M+ in DOGE revealed!Musk has played a huge role in the success of DOGE. While the initial tweet did not have much of an impact on the price, Musk continued to post about DOGE over the next few years, helping to raise awareness about the token. In 2021 DOGE took on a mind of its own, blowing up on social media and experiencing exponential growth. In 2022, Tesla began allowing customers to pay for certain products (mostly merchandise) with DOGE. This announcement also gave a small boost to the price of DOGE.Most recently, in March 2024, Musk said, "We should enable that" when asked about the possibility of buying a Tesla car with DOGE during a visit to the Berlin gigafactory. Additionally, Musk's social media platform, X, is in the process of securing payment licenses in U.S. states, potentially offering DOGE payments on the platform. Musk has played a pivotal role in helping DOGE become not only the largest meme coin but also one of the largest cryptocurrencies. Since Musk began posting about the token, it has seen huge gains and attracted tens of billions of dollars in market capitalization and is larger than nearly half the companies in the S & P 500. Musk does not seem to be done with DOGE either, with the potential to continue incorporating it with his many business ventures. Read Next:

Binance adds direct deposits and withdrawals for dYdX - CoinJournal



                    

                    
Binance has announced its integration with the dYdX Chain mainnet.
Deposits for DYDX are open, while support for withdrawals will go live once there’s sufficient volume.

Binance users can now directly deposit or withdraw dYdX (DYDX) tokens. DYDX is the native token of the L1 protocol dYdX Chain.
In an announcement on Tuesday, Binance said it had opened deposits for DYDX, with withdrawals set to go live once there is sufficient volume. 
Binance completes dYdX mainnet integration
The dYdX Chain is one of leading platforms in the decentralised exchange market, currently the top Perpetuals DEX platform in the ecosystem. That makes a move by a leading crypto exchange such as Binance’s a major development that could spark further growth.
dYdX Chain shared news of the Binance integration on X.

.@binance now supports dYdX Chain DYDX💡https://t.co/tCC24zwVKt pic.twitter.com/mWtrAJ84Zl
— dYdX (@dYdX) May 7, 2024

While Binance’s integration means dYdX is now available for direct deposits and withdrawals on another top crypto platform, it also opens up the network for user access to numerous decentralised applications (dApps).
Currently, OKX is the other top cryptocurrency exchange to support DYDX.
The dYdX Chain is a community-governed Cosmos appchain that distributes 100% of the protocol’s fees to DYDX stakers in the USDC stablecoin. Token holders can run a validator or stake their DYDX to one in order to participate in the network’s security and governance.
dYdX Chain growth
dYdX ranks among top DEX networks by trading volume and market share. 
According to details from CoinMarketCap, the exchange’s v4 is currently second-largest by 24-hour trading volume and has a market share of more than 11%.
Growth metrics for the dYdX Chain from last week show the weekly trading volume exceeded $7.5 billion, while the number of daily active traders reached 2,100. 
Meanwhile, staking distributions amounted to over $1.24 million in USDC paid to stakers last week.

Will BTC Follow TradFi Gains? | Bankless


ATHs Inbound? The S&P 500 has staged a respectable resurgence in the past several days, pumping 3.7% off its Thursday lows and continuing to rally into this week. Crypto markets may be starting off the week flat, but is the TradFi rally foreshadowing gains to come? BTC did not enjoy gains alongside stocks on Monday, yet is up 12% off its Thursday local lows and is now attempting to break above its 50-day exponential moving average (EMA), the very same technical resistance level that TradFi indexes struggled to crack throughout the end of April.Correlations between BTC and major indexes have strengthened in recent weeks, indicating that price movements of these different asset classes are occurring in the same direction. Should indexes continue the march higher, the price of BTC will begin moving upwards in short order assuming the correlation manages to hold.Source: The BlockA decisive break above the 50-day EMA would allow BTC to obliterate the $65k resistance level that has hampered bulls since mid-April, putting it squarely above the mid-range and leaving the path to retest the top of the range at $72k unabated!On Thursday, BTC perpetual swaps saw their longest and deepest period of negative funding rates this year (i.e.; shorts paid longs), anomalous behavior given the recent thirst for leverage, and while funding rates are again positive, they have yet to become problematic for bulls as they were toward the end of March, maintaining “healthy” levels at which longs are not paying exorbitant fees to remain in their positions.Lower funding rates reduce the risk of time-based capitulation and may increase demand for long positions, however, their consistent compression throughout April and the increased negative magnitude of the most recent drawdown suggests that we could be transitioning to a regime of structurally lower funding rates. Such a shift would likely coincide with declining prices.Unquestionably, market prices should be rebounding if we are destined to maintain the uptrends that have been supportive for price since the end of the 2022 bear market, but nonetheless, it remains important to note that a pull back prior to new all-time highs could provide confirmation that we have entered a different phase of the market… Source: Coinalyze

Ethereum Wild Fluctuations: Here's What ETH Implied Volatility Tells Us


                            The cryptocurrency market has recently exhibited distinct divergences in the behavior of its two leading assets, Bitcoin and Ethereum. While Bitcoin appears to be stepping into a phase of relative stability, Ethereum’s journey paints a contrasting picture of sustained uncertainty, particularly in its options market.
This divergence is highlighted by the sustained high levels of implied volatility associated with Ethereum options, signaling a cautious outlook among investors regarding its future price movements.

Ethereum Persisting Volatility: A Comparative Analysis
Implied volatility (IV) serves as a crucial indicator in the options market, providing insights into the expected price fluctuations of an asset over a specific period. It reflects the market’s temperature, gauging the intensity of potential price movements traders anticipate.
Recent analyses suggest that while Bitcoin’s implied volatility has settled down significantly post-halving, Ethereum’s has not followed suit. As Bitcoin’s IV dipped to a multi-month low, indicating a calming market, Ethereum’s IV remains stubbornly high.
Contrary to the calming waves in the Bitcoin market, Ethereum wrestles with heightened volatility. According to data from Bitfinex Alpha Report, Bitcoin’s volatility index sharply declined from 72% at the time of its latest halving event to about 55%.
Bitcoin (BTC) implied volatility. |  Source: Bitfinex Alpha Report
On the other hand, Ethereum saw a more modest reduction in its volatility index, dropping from 76% to 65% in the same period. This persistent volatility in Ethereum’s market is primarily fueled by uncertainties surrounding significant upcoming regulatory decisions and broader market implications.
Ethereum (ETH) implied volatility. | Source: Bitfinex Alpha Report
The Ethereum market is particularly jittery in anticipation of the US Securities and Exchange Commission’s (SEC) impending decision on two spot Ethereum ETFs, slated for late May 2024.
This upcoming regulatory milestone is considered a critical event that could either catalyze a major market move or exacerbate the current volatility.
The Bitfinex Alpha report underscores that regulatory uncertainty is a primary driver behind Ethereum’s less significant drop in its Volatility Risk Premium (VRP) compared to Bitcoin’s.
ETH And BTC Show Signs of Recovery Amid Volatility
Ethereum and Bitcoin have shown signs of recovery over the past week in terms of trading performance. Bitcoin has seen a 4.1% increase, while Ethereum reported a more modest gain of 2.4%.

However, the last 24 hours have been less favorable for Ethereum, with a slight dip of 0.7%, underscoring the ongoing volatility and investor caution.
Moreover, Ethereum’s network dynamics also reflect a subdued activity with a marked decrease in ETH burn rate attributed to reduced transaction fees.
This technical aspect further complements a cautious Ethereum market narrative, poised on the brink of potentially significant shifts depending on external regulatory actions.

Despite all these, analysts like Ashcrypto suggest that the current volatility could set the stage for a strong rebound in the year’s third quarter. Drawing on historical patterns, Ethereum’s speculative forecast is potentially reaching the $4,000 mark, provided market conditions align favorably.

Ethereum Game 'Fantasy Top' Pays $1.25M to Twitter Influencers It Turned Into NFT Cards - Decrypt

Crypto Twitter’s new favorite game, Fantasy Top, just paid out $1.25 million worth of Ethereum to top influencers that it turned into NFT trading cards for the fantasy football-esque experience.After launching on Ethereum scaling network Blast a week ago, the game—which allows players to create card lineups of their favorite Twitter (aka X) influencers, and earn rewards based on those influencers’ respective social engagement—took crypto by storm.The in-game “heroes” turned into cards include meme coin trader Ansem, DeGods creator Frank, and even Su Zhu—the co-founder of collapsed crypto hedge fund Three Arrows Capital. (Disclosure: Rug Radio co-founder Farokh Sarmad, president of the combined DASTAN parent company that includes Decrypt, is also one of the Fantasy Top "heroes.")Influencers earn a 1.5% fee from the trading volume of their card as well as a share of 10% of all pack sale revenue. Now Fantasy Top has made its first payouts—and creators are cashing in.The top three earners for week one were content creator Jenn Duong in first, then the aforementioned Ansem and Blast founder Pacman tied for second. First place was crowned with 6.7 ETH ($20,500) while the other two were blessed with 6.1 ETH ($18,700) apiece.“$18K in earnings for [the] first week, not too shabby,” Ansem posted on Twitter, in response to the news. “Fantasy Top [is] one of the crypto apps that could onboard a lot of Web2 creators.”Scoring in Fantasy Top is based on your lineup’s real world social media engagement. On Sunday, it appeared that Duong’s Twitter engagement was being artificially inflated by bots with degens trying to perform better in-game. She publicly condemned people doing this, temporarily putting her Twitter account on private as she sorted through it.But Fantasy Top says it’s using anti-botting protections when it comes to scoring, and Duong has also seen substantial organic engagement due to her video content around Fantasy Top, as well as other Blast apps and protocols.On top of the 409 ETH ($1.25 million) given out to heroes—300 ETH generated from pack sales, and 109 ETH from the card marketplace—another 2,480 Blast Gold was distributed to players too.We’re yet to know how much Blast Gold will be worth, but crypto industry observers estimate the value to be above $10—adding an additional $25,000 or more to the game’s first week payouts. "Heroes" also earn FAN points, which could be a precursor to a future token airdrop, though that's currently unclear.Fantasy Top also said that it plans to launch a feature that lets influencer "heroes" share their earned rewards with players who own their in-game cards, which would give the game a SocialFi component. Some influencers have already confirmed plans to share their rewards with NFT holders.Edited by Andrew HaywardStay on top of crypto news, get daily updates in your inbox.

Robinhood expects highest quarterly revenue since meme stock frenzy â Reuters - Crypto Briefing




Robinhood Markets, the trading app known for its commission-free trading and role in the 2021 meme stock frenzy, is expected to report its highest quarterly revenue in nearly three years, driven by a steady rebound in equity markets and crypto trading.According to an initial report from Reuters, there has been a resurgence in global markets fueled by bets on interest rate cuts, has attracted traders back to the platform, resulting in higher transaction-based revenue for the retail investor-focused brokerage.Robinhood’s shares have surged 58% in the first three months of the year, marking the sharpest quarterly stock increase since its listing.According to research firm Apptopia, Robinhood’s daily active users jumped 65% in March compared to the previous year, while total new mobile app downloads soared 94% during the same period. The company’s net interest revenue, the biggest driver of its top line, is expected to rise 24% to $258.24 billion in the first quarter, as reported by LSEG data.Robinhood’s assets under custody (AUC) exceeded $100 billion for the second consecutive month in February, and the company reported a surprise profit in the final quarter of 2023, setting its sights on profitable growth in 2024. Analysts from JP Morgan forecast a 24% increase in revenue to $548.61 million for the first quarter, with crypto trading revenue likely to more than double from the previous year to $80 million.Despite the positive outlook, the average recommendation of 17 brokerages covering Robinhood remains a “hold.” The median price target for the company is $19, a 65% increase from three months ago. Robinhood currently trades at 64.01 times its forward earnings estimate, significantly higher than the industry median of 10.97. Although the stock hit a more than two-year high in late March, it has lost more than half its value since its July 2021 market debut.The projection comes as Robinhood faces pressure from the SEC for alleged violations of securities laws.

Cartier Heir Charged by DOJ for Allegedly Laundering ‘Hundreds of Millions’ Partially via USDT Transfers - The Daily Hodl


								Prosecutors are charging three Colombian nationals and a purported direct descendant of the Cartier watch and jewelry-making family for allegedly laundering hundreds of millions of dollars.
According to the indictment unsealed by the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Southern District of New York, Maximilien de Hoop Cartier, Leonardo De Jesus Zuluaga Duque, Erica Milena Lopez Ortiz and Felipe Estrada Echeverry are charged with conspiring to commit money laundering.










The indictment further says that the four individuals belong to a network that laundered millions of dollars worth of the stablecoin Tether (USDT) – money that allegedly came from drug trafficking.
“The Network utilizes a system of money laundering brokers and shell companies in the US, Colombia, and elsewhere to, among other things, launder crime proceeds through the US to Colombia. Between in or about May 2023 and November 2023, Cartier, Zuluaga Duque, Lopez Ortiz, Estrada Echeverry, and others used the network to launder a total of approximately $14.5 million in Tether derived directly from the proceeds of drug trafficking.”
According to the indictment, Cartier operated an over-the-counter (OTC) crypto exchange while controlling and operating US-based shell companies that held bank accounts at various US lenders.
“In opening these bank accounts, Cartier misrepresented the true nature of the business of the Cartier Shell Companies – i.e., Cartier claimed to the banks that the Cartier Shell Companies were in the business of software or technology when, in fact, Cartier was using the companies to operate as an unlicensed money remitting business related to the operation of a cryptocurrency exchange. 
From January 2020 to the present, Cartier’s unlicensed money-transmitting business executed hundreds of millions of dollars worth of unlawful transactions and laundered hundreds of millions in criminal proceeds, including drug trafficking proceeds with Zuluaga Duque, Lopez Ortiz, Estrada Echeverry between about May and November 2023.”

Is a Rate Hike Possible Again? Minneapolis Fed President Kashkari Makes Major Remarks - Bitcoin Sistemi


Minneapolis FED President Neel Kashkari stated that although he believes that interest rates will remain stable for a long time, the institution may consider an interest rate increase if necessary.
Speaking at the Milken conference, Kashkari expressed concerns about the latest inflation data, questioning whether current monetary policy was restrictive enough to return price growth to the central bank's 2% target. He shared these views in an article published on the institution's website.


“The most likely scenario is that we are here for a long time,” Kashkari said. He added that if inflation starts to fall or there is a significant weakening in the labor market, the central bank may consider lowering interest rates.
However, Kashkari did not rule out the possibility of an interest rate increase. “If we are convinced that inflation has settled at 3% and we need to raise interest rates further, we will do so if necessary,” Kashkari said. He emphasized that this is not the most likely scenario and that the bar for an interest rate increase is quite high.






In addition to his comments on potential rate adjustments, Kashkari also announced that he raised his long-term neutral interest rate forecast to 2.5% from 2%. Minneapolis FED President, who will not vote on monetary policy this year, said it is important to determine policy based on where the neutral rate is in the short term.
In related news, NY Fed President John Williams has suggested that interest rates will be cut eventually, while Citadel founder Ken Griffin predicts that the Fed will cut rates this year, potentially by December.

Robinhood CEO Vlad Tenev Slams SEC, Says Trading Giant Prepared To Contest Charges in Court - The Daily Hodl


								The CEO of trading giant Robinhood is hitting back at the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) after receiving the regulator’s Wells notice.
Robinhood head Vlad Tenev took to X today to decry the SEC’s planned action against Robinhood Crypto.










“Over the last three years, we’ve reached a state of regulatory onslaught that is harmful to American companies and consumers. 
The SEC’s continued attack on crypto, coupled with recent rule proposals like the one related to predictive data analytics, mark yet another improper attempt by the administrative state to stifle innovation.”
Furthermore, Tenev says that Robinhood will fight the charges in the courts if push comes to shove.
“While we strive to maintain positive and productive relationships with our regulators, if necessary we will use our resources to contest this matter in the courts, with the intent of both defending our crypto business and establishing regulatory clarity in the United States for the benefit of our customers.”
The regulator recently informed Robinhood Crypto that the regulatory agency will soon be pursuing legal action against the trading platform.

Trump's Potential Return Could Spur Crypto Growth, Standard Chartered Report Suggests - Benzinga

The prospect of Donald Trump returning to the presidency might significantly bolster the cryptocurrency sector, according to a recent research report by Standard Chartered.What Happened: The investment bank forecasts that a second Trump administration could enhance the regulatory environment for digital assets, potentially leading to a surge in cryptocurrency valuations, Coindesk reported.In the report released on Tuesday, Standard Chartered outlines how the increasing risk of U.S. fiscal dominance and the Federal Reserve’s approach to government debt monetization are likely to drive investors towards alternative assets like cryptocurrencies. “We think that a second Trump administration would be broadly positive via a more supportive regulatory environment,” the report notes, emphasizing the potential benefits of such a political shift.Geoff Kendrick, the analyst behind the report, further explains that the scenario of U.S. fiscal dominance under Trump could positively impact Bitcoin BTC/USD and other cryptocurrencies. He highlights that this could lead to a “steeper nominal 2-year/10-year curve, a greater increase in break evens than real yields, and an increase in term premium.” Kendrick adds that the “Bitcoin price has a positive correlation with all three of these potential developments.”The analysis also touches on historical trends, pointing out that during Trump’s first term, there was a noticeable withdrawal of foreign official buyers from the U.S. Treasury market, with an average annual net selling of $207 billion, compared to just $55 billion under President Joe Biden‘s tenure.This trend could accelerate under a second Trump term, furthering the de-dollarization push and potentially boosting Bitcoin and other digital assets.Also Read: Binance CEO Calls For Colleague’s Release Amid Standoff With NigeriaMoreover, the report suggests that not only would a Trump presidency passively support cryptocurrencies through these broader economic dynamics, but it could also actively encourage their growth. “In addition to the passive boost to BTC from de-dollarization, we would expect a second Trump administration to be actively supportive of BTC (and digital assets more broadly) via looser regulation and the approval of U.S. spot ETFs,” the report states.With an optimistic outlook on the cryptocurrency market, Standard Chartered has set a target for Bitcoin to reach $150,000 by the end of this year and $200,000 by the end of 2025.What’s Next: As the discussion on the impact of political figures on digital assets continues, Benzinga’s upcoming Future of Digital Assets event on Nov. 19 will provide a crucial platform for exploring how potential political changes could shape the landscape of cryptocurrency investments.Read Next: Crypto ‘An Outsized Piece Of The Scams And Problems’ In Markets: Gary Gensler

MoMA’s Madeleine Pierpont: NFTs Are Already Part of Art History

Yes, there has been a hyper-financialization in the NFT space, but money is not a dirty word in art. Money and art are interlinked. NFTs, being so transparently connected to the content that's being produced, is not negative thing from my perspective. That being said, in the last two years, because of the bear market, there hasn't been as much turnover. People have had time to really focus on their projects, spend more time building and to understand what they want to communicate. There's fewer people throwing something out there trying to make a bunch of money and then pulling away from the ecosystem.

XRP Ledger Foundation Picks New Validator Node


According to a Tuesday announcement, Anodos Finance has been added to the XRP Ledger Foundation's unique node list (UNL). The list comprises a set of 35 validators that are considered to be trusted network participants.  Anodos Finance was added following the removal of Digifin.uk at the request of the former. "Being part of the UNL means we are now one of the key players in maintaining the integrity and stability of the XRP Ledger. It's a responsibility we accept with pride and excitement," the project said in a statement. In order to be included in the XRP Ledger Foundation's UNL, the validator be "highly available" with production-grade infrastructure. A potential validator should be an active participant in the amendment voting process. Furthermore, the entity behind the validator candidate must be clearly identified.  The XRP Foundation, an independent non-profit entity, is one of the trusted publishers of UNLs alongside the XRP Foundation. Centralization concerns The XRP Ledger Foundation started publishing its list of recommended nodes three years ago. Prior to that, Ripple (the XRP Foundation) and Ripple-funded web monetization platform Coil were the only notable entities with their own UNLs. Coil, which was founded by former Ripple CTO Stefan Thomas, went bankrupt. Other blockchain networks, such as Bitcoin and Ethereum, do not rely on a predefined list of trusted notes for maintaining consensus. Ripple frequently attracted a fair amount of criticism due to centralized concerns since it used to provide a default curated list of nodes. In fact, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission cited Ripple's control over nodes that are validating transactions during its prolonged legal battle with the company.

Bitcoin Initiative in South Korea Does Not Seem to Stop: They Signaled for June - Bitcoin Sistemi


South Korea's Democratic Party of Korea confirmed in June that it plans to request an authoritative comment on Bitcoin spot ETFs from the Financial Services Commission. The move is part of the party's efforts to fulfill its general election promises.
An official with the Democratic Party's policy committee announced the plans during a telephone interview. “After the 22nd National Assembly opens in June, we plan to again request an authoritative interpretation of the Bitcoin spot ETF from the financial authorities,” the official said.


The Democratic Party had previously announced that it would allow the issuance, listing and trading of spot ETFs that use virtual assets such as Bitcoin as underlying assets. This was an important promise in the general elections.

However, to date, South Korean local financial authorities have not allowed the issuance and trading of Bitcoin spot ETFs. They issued a comment that BTC spot ETFs are not financial investment products, given that virtual assets are not included in the underlying assets of ETFs under the Securities Act.





But that may change after the United States approved the launch of a Bitcoin spot ETF in January and trading of Bitcoin and Ethereum spot ETFs began in Hong Kong last month.

SEC vs Ripple: Defense Reveals Crucial Sealed Documents


In a significant development in the ongoing legal battle between the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and Ripple, renowned defense attorney James Filan recently disclosed that the regulator has sealed its latest reply brief and supporting exhibits. 
Pivotal to the case, these documents remain under wraps with public, redacted versions expected to be released by May 8, 2024.
Latest on SEC vs Ripple: Sealed Evidence Exposed
The sealed documents reportedly contain the SEC’s rebuttals to Ripple’s counterarguments against the initial remedies proposed by the regulator. This follows a landmark decision by Judge Analisa Torres last July. She found Ripple violating federal securities laws due to its sales of XRP to institutional investors.
Previously, the SEC sought a staggering $2 billion penalty from Ripple, a figure that the company has contested vigorously. Ripple’s legal team argues that the demanded sum is disproportionately high compared to the alleged infractions.

Instead, Ripple suggests a considerably lower penalty of $10 million, challenging the need for injunctive relief and disgorgement as proposed by the SEC.

“Ripple has every intent of adhering to that guidance in the future and every incentive to do so. The SEC’s Draconian remedial requests are ungrounded in law or principle… The Court should deny the SEC’s requests for an injunction, for disgorgement, and for pre-judgment interest, and should impose a civil penalty of no more than $10 million,” the filling read.


As the legal proceedings unfold, both parties meticulously review and redact sensitive information from the filings. This includes a comprehensive meet and confer session scheduled for May 7, 2024. Here, the parties will identify necessary redactions to protect confidential information, as stipulated by the court’s protective order.
The culmination of this phase will see the submission of omnibus letter motions by May 13. These aim to seal all materials related to the remedies briefing. This will be followed by counter-filings opposing the motions to seal, scheduled for May 20.

The case continues to garner significant attention. It affects Ripple and its operations and sets a precedent for cryptocurrency regulation under US securities laws.

Coinbase legal chief challenges SEC chair Gensler's claim that most crypto tokens are securities

Coinbase chief legal officer Paul Grewal called on US SEC Chair Gary Gensler to stop misleading the market about the legal status of cryptocurrencies in a May 7 social media post.Grewal made the statement in response to Gensler’s recent CNBC interview with Andrew Sorkin, where he asserted that numerous digital assets fall under the category of securities according to existing law.However, Grewal countered that the SEC chair’s claims were false as the watchdog’s lawyers have previously acknowledged that cryptocurrencies do not fall under the definition of securities.In his message to Gensler, Grewal stated unequivocally:“Please stop misleading the market — tokens are NOT securities. Their pleadings notwithstanding, your own attorneys have admitted this in court.”Inadequate crypto disclosureMeanwhile, Gensler reiterated his known stance that most cryptocurrencies are securities tokens in his CNBC interview, adding that they often lack the necessary disclosures meant for assets in this class.According to the SEC chair:“Without prejudging any one of them, many of those tokens are securities under the law of the land, as interpreted by the US Supreme Court. So we follow that law, and you, the investors, are not getting the required or needed disclosures about those assets.”Although Gensler did not specify which cryptocurrencies he considers securities, recent regulatory actions suggest that all major tokens, excluding Bitcoin, are under scrutiny.Since assuming the role of SEC Chair, Gensler has prioritized bringing crypto within the commission’s regulatory purview, citing the Howey test as a benchmark for determining securities status.Critics have lambasted Gensler’s enforcement-centric approach, advocating instead for legislative clarity from Congress. However, progress on crypto-related legislation has been sluggish, prolonging uncertainty in the industry.Several crypto entities, including Binance, Coinbase, and Ripple, are entangled in legal battles with the Gensler-led commission. Furthermore, during the past month, the financial watchdog has issued Wells Notices to other major crypto firms, such as Uniswap, Consensys, and digital trading platform Robinhood.Mentioned in this article

Nigeria Mulls Crypto P2P Ban in Fintech Conflict Escalation - DailyCoin


        
Nigeria bolsters crypto crackdown with Naira P2P exchange ban.



The government has been on a months-long tussle with crypto exchanges.



Binance and the Nigerian government are still embroiled in a fight.
Regulations in the crypto industry have heated over the past months as governments and financial authorities tighten oversight on the industry. Nigeria, which has had a rather muffled approach to the asset class, has recently championed actions against its local industry, asserting the manipulation of its local currency by market participants and exchanges. Following many months of tussle with no resolution in sight, local Nigerian crypto investors may now be facing severe restrictions.Nigeria Crypto Woes Threaten Naira P2P Ban According to local reports on Tuesday, May 7, the  Nigerian government is preparing to remove its native currency, Naira, from all peer-to-peer crypto platforms. 
The development was reportedly made known by the newly appointed Director-General of the Nigerian SEC, Emomotimi Agama, at a meeting with members of the Nigerian blockchain industry, citing efforts to tackle its currency manipulators.“That is one of the things that must be done to save this space; the delisting of the naira from the P2P platforms to avoid the level of manipulation that is currently happening,” he stated. If imposed, the restriction will prohibit global and local crypto service providers from offering peer-to-peer exchange or trading pairs with the naira, potentially resulting in significant restrictions for local investors. Agama also highlighted that more regulations will follow in the coming weeks, targeting the complete reform of the local industry and service providers within its jurisdiction. Despite the recency of the announcement, several crypto exchange platforms have already halted support for the naira.Crypto Exchanges Delist NairaScapegoated by the Nigerian government at the center of the currency manipulation drama, the leading exchange, Binance, was the first to suspend all naira-related services. 
The decision, announced on March 5, 2024, came amid the ongoing regulatory tussle between the exchange and the government, resulting in the arrest of two of its executives, Nadeem Anjarwalla and Tigran Gambaryan. Despite its exit, the Binance Nigeria saga failed to cease, followed by official criminal charges of tax evasion against the exchange, Gambaryan, and Anjarwalla have also been slapped with official charges of tax evasion by the Federal Inland Revenue Service (FIRS).Shortly after, on May 3, crypto exchange OKX delisted the naira from its p2p marketplace. While the exchange did not cite regulatory woes with the government, it confirmed “a change in local market requirements,” asserting that the service would no longer be available.  Read more about the latest update in the Binance Nigeria crypto drama: Binance CEO Urges Nigeria to Release Tigran GambaryanThe November Poloniex hacker has reappeared after months of dormancy; read more:Poloniex Hacker Returns to Launder $3.5M via Tornado Cash

Dogecoin Holders In Profit across 82%, What About Shiba Inu? | Bitcoinist.com


								Major cryptocurrencies have exhibited an interesting price dynamic in the past few days. According to data from Coinmarketcap, the majority of cryptocurrencies, including Dogecoin, have posted losses in the past 24 hours. On the other hand, some of these cryptocurrencies are still on a price increase when looking at a larger timeframe and many more addresses have crossed into the profitability zone in the past seven days. 
Dogecoin, for instance, is still up by 9% in a 7-day timeframe. As a result, the number of DOGE addresses in profitability has now been pushed to 83%, with 163,000 more addresses waiting to be pushed into profit if DOGE crosses over $0.1657.
Holders of Shiba Inu, Dogecoin’s meme counterpart, haven’t been treated to the same effect. At the time of writing, the number of SHIB holders in profitability has largely consolidated around 60%. 
Dogecoin And Shiba Inu Holder Profitability
According to data from IntoTheBlock’s “In/Out of the Money” metric, Dogecoin is still proving itself to be the top meme coin for holders over the long run. The majority of Dogecoin holders are still in profitability, despite the wider lackluster movement of most cryptocurrencies. Particularly, the number of Dogecoin holders in profit now stands at 83%, its highest level in weeks. 

At the time of writing, this metric shows that 5.23 million DOGE addresses are still in profit, representing 83.03% of the total addresses. This is in comparison to 826,350 addresses currently in loss, which represent 13.12% of the total addresses. Interestingly, 242,710 addresses, representing 3.85% of total addresses, are currently “in the money,” meaning they are neither in profit nor loss.
Shiba Inu, on the other hand, has not really seen a growth in the profitability of its holders. In terms of price action, both cryptocurrencies have increased from their price point in the beginning of the month. DOGE is up by 29%, while SHIB is up by 13.79%. However, on-chain data shows a varying level of profitability for traders. 
Holder profitability for SHIB is currently at 60%, with the 810,230 addresses in this cohort. Around 487,970 addresses are currently in loss, which represents 36.18% of the total addresses. Lastly, 50,590 addresses, representing 3.75% of total addresses, are “in the money.”
Profitability around the current price also shows that only 41.38% of Shiba Inu addresses that bought between $0.000020 and $0.000027 are making a profit. In contrast, more Dogecoin addresses (55.84%) are in profit around the current price level of $0.132243 and $0.179879.
Can SHIB Catch Up In Holder Profitability?
Shiba Inu has a long way to go before it reaches Dogecoin’s level of profitability for holders. An interesting fact about Shiba Inu is that it is deflationary by design, unlike Dogecoin, which has an unlimited supply. This means over time, the total number of Shiba Inu coins will decrease, making the remaining ones scarcer and potentially more valuable. This could lead to a stable price increase over the years and more investors moving into profitability. 
At the time of writing, DOGE is trading at $0.1588 while SHIB is trading at $0.00002403.

Bitcoin miner Marathon Digital's MARA hikes 17% after S&P 600 listing - AMBCrypto



Marathon Digital’s MARA surged 17.98% on Monday after its listing on the S&P SmallCap 600 index
Company set to release its quarterly earnings report on 9 May

Bitcoin’s [BTC] largest miner by market cap, Marathon Digital, saw its shares (MARA) hike by 17.98% during Monday’s trading session. By hiking as it did, MARA marked an extended recovery, pushing it closer to $20 as it effectively reversed over 90% of its losses in April. 
Bitcoin miner joins S&P 600
The massive single-day jump followed the S&P Global listing last Friday. Marathon Digital was included in the S&P 600, an index that tracks the smallest traded public U.S companies based on market cap.
The development happened last Friday after market hours, but was only priced on Monday, as underlined by the aforementioned jump. The S&P 600, also known as the S&P SmallCap 600, requires a market cap of $1 billion—$6.7 billion for listing. Additionally, firms have to record positive profits for the last four quarters. 
After Monday’s rally, MARA had a market cap of $5.64 billion. With a Q1 earnings report scheduled for 9 May, staying on the index will depend on future quarterly earnings.
Source: MARA stock
Despite the Monday jump and overall recovery in May, however, MARA’s YTD (year-to-date) performance was down 9.86% at press time. In fact, the YTD performance across most miners’ stocks, like Riot Platforms and Hut 8, have fallen by double-digits. 
Apart from mining rewards, which dropped by half after the halving, transaction fees have become a key revenue stream for Bitcoin miners. 
However, the enlisting of MARA on the S&P 600 marks another relevant chapter for Bitcoin-linked publicly traded companies. It will increase the visibility of Marathon Digital and the potential to attract more investment in the mining ecosystem.  
However, BTC closed in the red during MARA’s Monday rally. Ergo, it will be interesting to see how BTC reacts to Marathon Digital’s quarterly earnings report on 9 May.

Bitcoin Rally Could Be Short-Lived if BTC Follows Stock Market, According to Analyst Benjamin Cowen - The Daily Hodl


								A widely followed crypto analyst says that Bitcoin (BTC) may be acting as a “more volatile version” of the stock market.
In a new video update, crypto strategist Benjamin Cowen tells his 801,000 YouTube subscribers that Bitcoin may be following in the footsteps of the Russell 2000 Index, NASDAQ and S&P 500.










According to the analyst, the three major stock indexes rose to around their 50-day simple moving average (SMA) prior to witnessing a pullback. Cowen says that BTC may also rise to its 50-day SMA before another sell-off event.
“You have the S&P, the NASDAQ and the Russell all closing Friday just below their 50-day moving average. A couple of weeks ago, we were talking about the S&P, the NASDAQ and the Russell were all at their bull market support band and for some reason Bitcoin was not.
And if [Bitcoin] is just a more volatile version of the stock market, it would stand to reason that if you’re going to get a correction by the S&P and the NASDAQ and the Russell to the 20-week SMA, 21-week EMA (exponential moving average) you’re probably going to see it happen for Bitcoin. And now it has.
But then we just showed that the S&P, the Russell, the NASDAQ just went back up to their 50-day moving average. Then it raises the question where’s the 50-day moving average for Bitcoin?..
It’s roughly $66,000…
Now if it doesn’t get here, that would imply a lot of weakness in the cryptoverse. If it gets there, then it is just more evidence once again that we are just sort of operating as a more volatile version of the stock market and maybe even a somewhat lagged version of the stock market.”
Source: Benjamin Cowen/YouTube
Yesterday, BTC hit a high of $65,520. At time of writing Bitcoin is trading for $63,711.

Binance CEO Richard Teng Demands Nigeria Release Imprisoned Employee, Offers Help in Resolving Tax Issues - The Daily Hodl


								Binance CEO Richard Teng is demanding the release of a top executive imprisoned in Nigeria for alleged money laundering crimes.
In a new Binance blog post, Teng calls on Nigerian authorities to release Tigran Gambaryan, head of the crypto exchange’s Financial Crime Compliance team, who has been held for more than 70 days.










Gambaryan was arrested in February after flying to the country to engage in regulatory talks.
Upon Gambaryan’s release, Teng promises that Binance, the world’s largest crypto exchange, will work with Nigerian authorities to resolve alleged potential outstanding tax liabilities.
Says Teng,
“Let Tigran go home to his family, and then Binance will work through the same process that we have done with Nigeria’s law enforcement community voluntarily more than 600 times in the past. We will always work to protect innocent users, and bad actors are not welcome on our platform. We will work tirelessly with public and private partners to remove them. Furthermore, we will continue engagement with Nigeria’s Federal Inland Revenue Service (FIRS) on resolving potential historic tax liabilities. 
It remains unclear to me as to why this is not a solution to which the Nigerian government officials are willing to agree. The Nigerian government has extraordinary power to determine the future of Binance and the broader crypto industry within its borders.
 At the end of the day, Binance wants to have a future where we work alongside the Nigerian government to be part of building a strong economy for the Nigerian people. But this crisis must come to a resolution quickly, and Tigran must be allowed to go home if we’re going to move forward.”
In March, Nigeria’s Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) leveled various charges against Binance, Gambaryan and his colleague Nadeem Anjarwalla, the regional manager for the crypto exchange’s Africa operations.
The charges included “operating without the required license, unlawfully negotiating foreign exchange rates, tax evasion and concealing the origin of illegal proceeds and revenue of $35.4 million.”

SEC pushes back against Terraform’s claims fraud happened outside US

Lawyers for the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) have filed their response to a memo by Terraform Labs in proposed remedies for judgment following a verdict in the civil case. In a May 6 filing in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York, the SEC pushed back against Terraform’s arguments for less disgorgement in judgment in the civil case, for which a jury found the firm liable. According to SEC lawyers, Terraform and co-founder Do Kwon never presented the argument in court that the commission was enforcing the extraterritorial application of federal laws for the offer and sale of tokens outside the United States. “Defendants’ arguments lack merit as they rely on a misapplication of the law and misstatement of the relevant facts,” said the SEC filing. Source: PACEREven if the court accepted the legal basis of Terraform’s argument, the SEC cited several examples of activities in the U.S. that could be used to enforce securities laws. The argument omitted the “secret role” that a U.S. company, Jump, played in restoring TerraUSD (UST) to its dollar peg. Terraform’s former communications head was based in California, where he “posted a series of false and misleading tweets at Kwon’s direction that credited UST’s recovery of its $1 peg to its algorithm.” Kwon touted UST in person at a New York conference in September 2021 and spoke to media outlets with an audience in the country.The SEC planned to seek $3.6 billion in disgorgement from Terraform and Kwon and $1.7 billion in “ill-gotten gains from Defendants’ net sales of UST.” In its filing for proposed judgment, Terraform suggested a $1 million civil penalty and no disgorgement.Related: Montenegrin court postpones Do Kwon’s extradition to South KoreaAfter a two-week trial, a jury found Terraform and Kwon liable for fraud in April. All parties in the civil lawsuit are scheduled to return to court on May 22 for Judge Jed Rakoff to consider proposed remedies.Kwon could not attend the trial in person due to legal entanglements in Montenegro. In 2023, the Terraform co-founder was arrested and sentenced to four months in prison for using falsified travel documents. He remains in the country as the courts consider extradition requests from the U.S. and South Korea.Magazine: CZ gets jail sentence, Gensler viewed Ether as security, and FBI targets mixers: Hodler’s Digest, April 28 – May 4

My traumatic Apple ID hack showed pitfalls of centralized identity

I was the target of a sophisticated breach of my Apple ID that caused a significant emotional and financial toll. My background as a tech entrepreneur meant I knew the importance of multi-factor authentication and the warning signs of SIM swaps and had precautions in place. Despite this vigilance, I fell victim to an audacious attack one January evening last year, painfully showing that it can happen to anyone.I've had my Apple ID since it was invented. I've bought tens of thousands — maybe hundreds of thousands — of dollars worth of software, movies, TV shows, hardware. Suddenly, I was informed of 15,000 login attempts. It was literally “Boom, boom, boom.” I pressed “Don't allow, don't allow, don't Then, I was phoned by someone claiming to work for Apple technical support. They had in-depth information about how many devices I owned and when they were last used — even where the login attempts were coming from. A lot of unsuspecting victims would find this call credible, but something wasn't sitting right with me. He said, “I'm going to send you a code” — and I replied, “I'm not going to give it to you.”Related: Crypto leaders should stop flirting with CBDCsCodes were subsequently sent to my phone — from the exact same number that Apple had used to send verification codes in the past. I decided to call Apple directly to get to the bottom of what was going on, but the nightmare was only just beginning. The attacker had managed to gain access to my account.I explained what was happening, but the woman from Apple basically told me, “Accept your losses.” Excuse me? What do you mean? I'm technically savvy — I knew that my Apple ID was potentially forever gone. That doesn't mean there weren’t bigger things at play. I had nonfungible tokens (NFTs) and art that I'd kept for two years. I had access to a lot of corporate accounts, brokerage accounts — all sorts of stuff. And she just kept repeating “Accept your loss, accept your loss, accept your loss.”A 2023 Wall Street Journal illustration showed how Apple accounts could be breached if attackers held an iPhone's password. Source: Wall Street JournalI was in a race against time to protect my assets and began moving my fiat currency to a safe location, but my crypto had already been transferred to a wallet out of my control and liquidated. I then got an anonymous call from someone using a voice modulator with a chilling message: "Check your Telegram." Messages were sent that said my Apple ID and assets would be returned if the phone numbers and email addresses of three other people were handed over. But I refused, telling the attacker he picked the wrong person.I started tweeting about the situation, and the hacker panicked. He threatened to leak pictures of my four-month-old daughter, so I took down the tweet.They continued to message, and I was then told I would get my Apple ID back as long as I didn't post online for 48 hours. But three days later, the goalposts had been shifted once again. Now the attacker was demanding $50,000. “Normally what I do is find people who are usually having affairs, doing something wrong or have sensitive information that I extort them for," the cybercriminal told me.Months of terrorFor the three months that followed, the attacker was trying to extort and terrorize me — stress I had to conceal from my wife and daughter. To make matters worse, my Amex and Chase withdrawal limits were slashed, and my credit rating plummeted.Undeterred, I continued to exchange messages and calls with the man who stole my identity, building up gigabytes of evidence. Little did I know that the walls were already closing in on the attacker. The criminal was already on the radar of law enforcement after being indicted for a SIM swap — and detectives soon realized this was the tip of the iceberg. Because stolen funds had been used on Cash App and Venmo, investigators were able to connect the dots and identify me as a victim. When an FBI agent called, I was able to give a detailed description of the person responsible — and it was enough to get a warrant. They went and broke into his house. The guy was on my Apple ID.Related: Jerome Powell’s pivot heralds a boring summer for BitcoinThe investigation later revealed that there were about 20 other victims. Most of them were women. He would make a lot of them do sexual things. I got a call from the sentencing officer who didn't know this was a thing. She said she's been around serial killers, murderers… bad people, and she's never had a worse feeling than interacting with this person.I was the only victim who wasn't afraid to speak out — and provided a written statement to the court. The power of those words led to the judge doubling the sentence to eight years without parole, even though the hacker had pleaded guilty and snitched on his associates. A federal case is pending so he will be in jail for a while. It's a waste of life. Protect your digital identityIt was one of the most traumatic experiences of my life.Meanwhile, countless millions of people around the world continue to depend on their Apple IDs in their day-to-day lives — blissfully unaware of the damage a hack causes. Take my social security number, don't take my digital identity. I didn't realize Apple was my digital identity until it was too late.The attacker was part of a wider, sophisticated scheme — with scammers brazenly advertising job vacancies to join them. People then join who think they are genuinely working for Apple Support, when they are unwittingly involved in financial crime.New speech recognition solutions are urgently needed to better protect the public — especially as someone's voice can be recreated and abused in under 30 minutes.Digital identities will be the foundation of Web3. Without them, we really can't verify who we're speaking to. Our communication stack as a society, as a civilization is embarrassing right now. A true digital identity allows you to take custody of your own data and solutions. I can now take information from my doctor and keep it in my storage. I can protect my financial information. I can take all of that.I want to make sure this never happens to anyone else. I’m about to receive a refund from Apple for all of the purchases I made over the past 20 years as compensation — and would like to share these top tips for other victims:Keep a strict timeline and take rigorous notesMake sure law enforcement official you speak to takes notes as wellWrite down the date and time of the call, as well as their name and detailsContact local police and tell them what happened to you File a detailed IC3 report, as this helps federal authorities apprehend criminalsAfter experiencing the ruinous impact of having my digital life stolen in the blink of an eye, I believe there's only one answer: decentralized identities where personal data is fully encrypted and stored in a secure wallet.Amro Shihadah is a guest columnist for Cointelegraph and a former director of operations at Nillion, and is a finance professional with expertise in traditional finance and blockchain and AI technologies.

Superchain-based Mode Network Kicks Off Airdrop - The Defiant

The Ethereum Layer 2 network debuted at a $73 million market capitalization.Mode, a Layer 2 network that leverages Optimism’s OP Stack, has launched its native MODE token with an airdrop for early adopters.In this initial stage, 500 million MODE tokens will be distributed, accounting for 5.5% of the total 10 billion token supply.MODE has been met with disinterest from the market, with the token dropping 60% shortly after its launch, showcasing a $73 million market capitalization.The network’s founder, James Ross, declined to comment on the price action, telling The Defiant, “We are focused on building.”MODE PriceIn addition to the 500 million MODE tokens allocated for the community, 1,000,000 OP tokens worth $2.7 million will be awarded to users through various incentive campaigns.Airdrop 1 is based on the Mode points which users have been accruing since the “Mode Sunrise” event that kicked off in January. These points were based on users’ activities across DeFi, NFTs, and other Layer-2 networks.The team has allocated 27% of the MODE supply to the foundation and treasury, 35% to users and other airdrops, 19% to investors, and 19% to core contributors.According to Ross, “Incentives are important to bootstrap early communities, and as an industry, we should continue to optimize them.” He told The Defiant that even though airdrops have been the source of controversy lately, his team will continue to reward users and developers to grow the ecosystem.Parabolic GrowthMode has seen parabolic growth in 2024. According to DefiLlama, it spiked from $6,000 in total value locked (TVL) on Jan. 1 to $448 million today, and the project claims more than 450,000 active wallets are participating in the network.Mode TVLThe Superchain DeFi HubThe Mode network touts itself as an experimental DeFi protocol developed using the OP Stack. It’s a member of the Superchain ecosystem, which refers to an Optimism-based technology stack that aims to create a network of blockchains interoperating through a common framework.Recently, the Mode network received a strategic 2 million OP grant (roughly $4.5 million today) from Optimism to become the Superchain DeFi Hub.Superchain members also include Base, Worldcoin, and Fraxtal, among others.

Solana Slerf (SOLSLERF) to Explode 11,000%, as it Looks to Challenge Shiba Inu and Dogecoin



                    

Solana Slerf (SOLSLERF) could become a viral memecoin, like Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE).



Solana Slerf (SOLSLERF), a Solana memecoin that was launched today, is aiming to challenge other memecoin giants, such as Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE).




Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Solana Slerf presents a similar opportunity.



Solana Slerf has market cap below $20,000 at the moment, meaning that when it just reaches a modest market cap of $200,000-$500,000, early investors would generate returns of 1,000%-3,000% in a matter of days or hours.



The exciting memecoin is poised to rally 5,300% in the coming two days, and Solana Slerf could potentially reach a multi-million dollar market cap within a few weeks.




Currently, Solana Slerf can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jupiter and Raydium, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days.



To buy Solana Slerf on these platforms, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Solana Slerf by entering its contract address – D2R7sKwPNpWGtEfMJiLVe5G2ZJbExnk98PEft2dhyCrL – in the receiving field.



In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price.



If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner.




The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum.



This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like SOLSLERF.

SHIB’s K9 Releases BONE Crusher Tutorial for New Staking dApp - DailyCoin


        
Shiba Inu awards K9 DAO node validator status on Shibarium L2.



Journalist Mario Nawfal recently joined K9 DAO’s advisory board.



Shibarium reached a new all-time high in TVL of $3.9M in March.
Shiba Inu’s (SHIB) official partner, K9 Finance, is slated to release its much-anticipated Liquid Staking Derivatives (LSD) platform in Q3 of 2024 to bolster Shibarium’s on-chain liquidity. Shibarium Layer-2’s structure previously soared to a record-high $3.9 million in TVL when WoofSwap joined Shibarium L2.K9 Finance DAO Enters Shibarium As ValidatorThis time, the K9 platform is poised to bring even more value to Shiba Inu’s Layer-2 blockchain, as K9 Finance dApp exhibits a similar functionality to Ether’s Lido Protocol. On Lido, Ethereum’s crypto aficionados can diversify their crypto-staking portfolios in multiple vaults simultaneously, magnifying returns.K9 Finance DAO joins Shibarium L2 as a node validator, looking after the chain’s security and rewarding KNINE holders with BONE tokens for validating Shibarium’s blocks. This way, K9 Finance DAO invents a dual reward token system to unite the SHIB Army and KNINE communities. 
“We’re honored to start as validators for Shibarium. We see the power of DeFi and are ready to support Shibarium with secure validation fueled by $KNINE,”  enthusiastically remarked Buzz, a co-founding member of K9 DAO. In celebration of Shiba Inu whitelisting K9 DAO as a validator, the dev team shared a short video tutorial of the ground-breaking dynamic staking mechanism.Here’s What K9 Finance’s LSD App Looks LikeBONE Crusher, the core product of K9 Finance DAO, allows crypto enthusiasts to delegate their BONE and earn yield on multiple digital assets. Named after Borophaginae, a bear-like predecessor to modern dogs, this dApp employs Bone ShibaSwap (BONE), Shibarium’s official gas fee and governance token.
In the step-by-step tutorial, K9 explained how to use the LSD system. The 52-second video tutorial shows an example of a crypto wallet connected via MetaMask while BONE is employed for the deed. The system swaps BONE for knBONE, depicted in the video, with a 1:1.07 ratio with BONE.Following the developments in Shiba Inu’s decentralization quest, BONE continued to trade in phased consolidation. As of press time, BONE trades below key support at $0.6085, according to CoinGecko. Growing to $152 million in market cap, BONE is now over 96% down from its all-time high of $15.50, set nearly three years ago.On the Flipside
The recently launched KNINE token plunged to an all-time low of $0.00003276 on the evening of May 6 but later bounced back 13.6% from the daily bottom.



SHIB also dived 3% on Tuesday, dipping slightly below its $14B market cap and sliding from its $0.0000261 weekly heights.
Why This MattersUnprecedented staking perks on Shiba Inu’s Layer-2 blockchain offer a dual staking model, which has been proven to be successful on other popular blockchains with large communities.Read DailyCoin’s latest cryptocurrency news:eToro vs. Robinhood: What’s Better for Trading Crypto?Ethereum Turns Inflationary as Fees Remain at Record Lows

House Republicans Move To Crush SEC's Anti-Crypto Banking Policy - Decrypt

Pro-crypto Republicans are preparing a broadside against the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) this week, demanding that the agency rescind its current guidance that they say discourages banks from offering crypto custody services.On Wednesday, the House of Representatives will vote on Rep. Mike Flood’s (R-Nebraska) joint resolution to lodge congressional disapproval of Staff Accounting Bulletin (SAB) 121. A companion resolution was introduced in the Senate.SAB 121—published on the SEC website—outlines the opinions of SEC staff about the risks crypto custodians should consider and lays out the related disclosure requirements under federal securities laws.While the SEC positions SABs as guidance rather than formal rules, Flood argued on Monday that SAB 121 represents “both a change in policy and a change that’s controversial.” He said the SEC also bypassed the traditional SAB development process, which usually involve consultation with Federal banking agencies.“It is unfortunate that the SEC would attempt to circumvent the rulemaking process while falsely claiming that SAB 121 is simply non-binding staff-level guidance,” Flood said before the House Committee on Rules on Monday.Within SAB 121, the SEC warns of “technological,” “legal,” and “regulatory” risks unique to crypto-custodians, claiming they could have a “significant impact on the entity’s operations and financial condition.” Flood blames warnings like this for keeping banks and broker-dealers away from safeguarding crypto assets like other financial assets—even four months after the agency’s approval of Bitcoin spot ETFs.“The SEC has impeded this longstanding practice and made safeguarding digital assets prohibitively expensive for trustworthy and highly regulated institutions,” he continued.A resolution is not legally binding but expresses the collective sentiment of Congress.Tom Emmer (R-Minn.), arguably the SEC’s fiercest critic on Capitol Hill, backed Flood’s legislation on Monday, calling the “illegal” SAB 121 an example of the SEC’s attempts to claim regulatory authority over the crypto industry at large.“SAB 121 introduces more unnecessary and avoidable concentration risk into the digital asset ecosystem, making our markets less fair, less orderly, and less efficient,” he argued. Foreign banks, Emmer added, already can compete in this arena, leaving the U.S. behind.The SEC has targeted several of the largest crypto companies—from exchanges and other custodial service providers to software development teams—with lawsuits, including Coinbase, Binance, Kraken, Uniswap Labs, and Robinhood.If the joint resolution, designated H.J.Res.109, passes its floor vote in the House tomorrow, it must still await the fate of its companion resolution in the Senate, S.J.Res.59, which has not yet been passed out of committee. It would become law with a two-thirds vote in both chambers.Edited by Ryan Ozawa.Stay on top of crypto news, get daily updates in your inbox.

Every US Bitcoin ETFs sees daily inflows for the first time - Crypto Briefing




Every spot Bitcoin ETF in the US register inflows for the first timeBloomberg ETF analyst Eric Balchunas pointed out that boomers are better at holding their ETF shares than crypto native investors.All spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) in the US registered positive netflows on March 6, according to Bloomberg ETF analyst Eric Balchunas. He shared on X that this is a first for daily netflows.Moreover, Balchunas said that over 95% of ETF investors held their shares during “what was a pretty nasty and persistent downturn.”“As we said, outflows will happen, and so will inflows but over time two things tend to be true for ETFs: net growth and relatively strong hands,” the Bloomberg analyst added.Balchunas also shared while answering one of the comments that, from what he’s seen so far, boomers are better holders than crypto natives. “This is a tiny hot sauce allocation for 60-40 crowd, not their ‘real portfolio’. This helps them stomach the volatility.”Furthermore, US spot Bitcoin ETFs added 4,412 BTC to their holdings, which is equivalent to over $280 million, according to X user Lookonchain. The largest Bitcoin additions were registered by Fidelity’s FBTC and ARK Invest’s ARKB, with 1,574 BTC and 1,200 BTC in inflows, respectively.Cumulatively, US Bitcoin ETFs hold over $52 billion in Bitcoin or 821,736 BTC. Grayscale’s GBTC still leads the pack with 291,293 BTC at the time of writing, with BlackRock’s IBIT close by with 274,029 BTC.

                        Bancolombia Group, Colombia’s largest bank, launched the cryptocurrency exchange Wenia on May 3, marking a major step in the country’s crypto evolution.According to the announcement, the development follows nearly a decade of research and signifies the bank’s dedication to Colombia’s crypto market.Colombia’s Wenia and COPW
Wenia, alongside the newly introduced Colombian peso stablecoin COPW, which has a 1:1 parity to the Colombian peso, seeks to attract 60,000 users in its first year. The platform’s goal is to compete with major crypto exchanges like Binance and Coinbase, offering trading in Bitcoin, USD Coin, Polygon, Ether, and, of course, the COPW stablecoin.By catering to both experienced and novice traders, Wenia seeks to solidify Colombia’s position as a leader in crypto adoption within Latin America.Access to the exchange requires Colombian residency, aligning with the nation’s rising prominence in the global crypto market. Colombia currently holds third place in the 2023 Global Crypto Adoption Index among Latin American countries, demonstrating considerable interest in crypto assets within the region.Juan Carlos Mora, president of Bancolombia Group, highlighted the bank’s decade-long journey to develop a platform that facilitates the adoption of digital assets and blockchain technology. This move underscores Bancolombia’s commitment to innovation within the Colombia crypto sphere.Risks of Colombia’s Crypto Investments
While this development presents exciting opportunities, Bancolombia emphasized the importance of understanding the risks associated with digital assets. These assets lack deposit insurance and carry inherent risks like volatility and potential loss. Additionally, no entity within the Bancolombia Group participates directly in digital asset transactions. The bank also cautioned traders about the absence of government backing or guaranteed safe storage methods for these assets.Additionally, a lawyer posted on LinkedIn about Wenia’s independent status as an entity registered in Bermuda. Any legal claims or disputes would fall under the jurisdiction of Bermuda courts, involving Wenia directly, not Bancolombia.

Chinese Millionaire's Giant Company Makes Multimillion-Dollar Bitcoin Move - Bitcoin Sistemi


Monolith Management, the Hong Kong-based investment firm founded by former Sequoia China executive Cao Xi, announced a significant investment in BlackRock's spot Bitcoin ETF in its latest filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.
The firm disclosed that it has more than $24 million in BlackRock's Bitcoin ETF, which trades under the symbol IBIT. The investment represents the firm's fifth-largest position and is more than double its stake in Meta, formerly known as Facebook and run by Mark Zuckerberg.



According to the same application, Monolith Management's first two investments are in technology giants Nvidia and Microsoft. Cao Xi, who was a partner at Sequoia China for several years, founded Monolith Management as a technology-focused fund.
Another Hong Kong-based fund, IvyRock Asset Management, also reported in its own SEC filing that it owns approximately $19 million in BlackRock's spot Bitcoin ETF. Spot BTC ETFs recently launched on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange, but so far these instruments have attracted less capital than their U.S. counterparts.

Democrats, Republicans clash over SEC role in House hearing - Blockworks


Democrats and Republicans clashed over how the Securities and Exchange Commission is handling crypto enforcement actions during a House Financial Services subcommittee hearing Tuesday. 
Capital Markets Subcommittee Chair Ann Wagner, R-Mo., kicked off the hearing titled “SEC enforcement: balancing deterrence with due process,” with a jab at the securities regulator, mentioning the recent sanctions the SEC received in its case against Debt Box. 
“Public trust in the SEC will only decline when its employees are sanctioned and forced to resign for their quote gross abuse of power, as they were in the recent case against the crypto platform known as Debt Box,” Wagner said.

Rep. Brad Sherman, D-Cali., was quick to counter Wagner’s point, arguing that the agency handled the misconduct appropriately. 
“There were two SEC lawyers who acted wrongfully in the Debt Box case,” Sherman said. “They’ve been fired, and I think that sets an example that will assure that other SEC lawyers do not act similarly.” 
Rep. Maxine Waters, D-Cali., a typical vocal opponent of the crypto industry alongside Sherman, took a partisan stance, asserting that her side of the aisle is the only one looking out for constituents. 
“My message to the crypto industry and everyone else: Democrats will always press for compliance, investor protection and market integrity,” Waters said. 
The hearing comes a day after the House Committee on Rules moved to advance a joint resolution that would overturn the SEC’s Staff Accounting Bill (SAB) 121, a controversial advisory that states digital asset custodians should report a liability and “corresponding assets” on their balance sheets for all cryptocurrencies under custody.
Committee members Mike Flood, R-Neb., and Wiley Nickel, D-N.C., introduced the resolution earlier this month alongside a similar measure in the Senate spearheaded by Cynthia Lummis, R-Wyom. The legislators cited a report from the Government Accountability Office, which stated in an October 2023 report that SAB 121 should have been issued as a rule under the official process. 
“It is unfortunate that the SEC would attempt to circumvent the rulemaking process while falsely claiming that SAB 121 is simply non-binding staff-level guidance,” Flood said Monday during testimony before the Rules Committee. 
The resolution heads to the House floor Wednesday for debate. Waters argued Tuesday that this “attempt to kill SAB 121” is unnecessary and prevents the SEC from carrying out its rightful duties.

How Axelar Intends to Connect Bitcoin with Over 65 Other Chains - DailyCoin


        
Axelar has unveiled a new product called Interchain Amplifier.



Interchain Amplifier promises to make connecting with Bitcoin and over 65 other chains easier than ever.



AXL’s price remains muted despite the revolutionary potential of the new product.
Axelar is taking steps to expand its footprint.Since bursting onto the scene in 2020, cross-chain interoperability solution provider Axelar has made its vision clear: making it easier for developers to build applications that can be accessed across multiple networks. 
In the latest effort to achieve this goal, the platform has unveiled a new product called Interchain Amplifier, which intends to democratize the process of joining Axelar’s ecosystem of supported chains. According to Axelar, multiple networks have already expressed interest in the product.Axelar Amplifier to Allow Multiple Networks Connect with Bitcoin and MoreIn a Monday, May 6 statement, Axelar announced that multiple projects, including prominent Bitcoin Layer 2 network Stacks and Hedera, have committed to participating in the devnet pilot of Interchain Amplifier to achieve interoperability with Bitcoin and 65 other blockchains.The Interchain Amplifier is an open-source smart contract developer kit that allows interested networks to plug into the Axelar ecosystem and connect with supported blockchains. This allows DApp developers to build on one chain and market to users across multiple networks without redeploying the application.The Interchain Amplifier consists of three main components: an on-chain message router, a protocol that enables data sharing between different blockchain networks, a gateway that translates communications between protocols, and CosWasm methods for receiving and sending messages, all of which work together to allow networks transfer data and assets.A Touchpoint for the Burgeoning Bitcoin Layer 2 Space?Emphasizing the importance of the Stacks integration, Axelar asserted that it opened the door to seamless interoperability with the burgeoning Bitcoin Layer 2 ecosystem.
“The excitement around Bitcoin L2s and other novel blockchain approaches now has an outlet. I’m thrilled to see such a diverse group of consensus mechanisms leading the move to interoperability that’s fast, open, and permissionless,” Axelar co-founder Sergey Gorbunov noted in a press release.Despite the potential of the Interchain Amplifier to bolster the Axelar ecosystem, AXL has yet to react to the news. It is trading at $1.25, representing a negligible 0.9% decline at the time of writing.On the Flipside Why This MattersAs more blockchains go live, the need for secure interoperability solutions grows. Axelar is among the prominent players in the interoperability space.

What Polygon Miden Brings to the Table as Testnet Goes Live - DailyCoin


        
Polygon Miden has gone live on testnet.



Miden promises to unlock new use cases with a combination of features that make it suitable for privacy and high throughput use cases.



According to Polygon (MATIC) Labs CEO, it may be the team’s most ambitious project yet.
Polygon Miden is inching toward a full launch.After over two years of development, developers have released the ZK-rollup on a testnet, allowing users and developers to interact with some of its novel features that are not feasible on other EVMs.
How does Miden differentiate itself from other ZK-rollups, including the Polygon zkEVM?A Home For Privacy and High-Throughput ApplicationsIn an X post on Monday, May 6, Polygon (MATIC) Labs disclosed that the Miden Alpha testnet was live, calling users and developers to explore the network and try token transfers and smart contract execution.Polygon Miden differentiates itself from most other ZK-rollups with two defining features: client-side proving and parallel execution. Client-side proving allows users to generate and verify proofs about data on their devices without posting the data on the network. The benefits of this system are two-fold: firstly, it enables greater privacy. Secondly, it reduces the network’s workload, allowing for greater scalability. Polygon Miden’s scalability is further bolstered by parallel execution, which allows concurrent processing of multiple tasks across several processors.
The network’s key features make it suitable for privacy and high throughput applications. The features also unlock several capabilities, such as regulatory compliance for DeFi protocols while maintaining user privacy.Polygon’s “Most Groundbreaking Chain?”Commenting on the Miden testnet launch, Polygon Labs CEO Marc Boiron described it as “the most groundbreaking chain in the space” as he urged users to explore it.Miden expands Polygon’s blockchain ecosystem, which includes the PoS chain that is set to transition to a zkEVM validium chain to host payments-focused applications, and the standard zkEVM, which is projected to be the ecosystem’s DeFi home.Per Polygon’s multichain roadmap, the Miden chain will share liquidity with other chains in the Polygon ecosystem through the AggLayer.On the Flipside Why This MattersPolygon (MATIC) is one of the most popular Ethereum scaling solutions. The Miden project promises to address several concerns with blockchain privacy, including how users can maintain privacy and remain compliant.Read this for more on Polygon:Polygon (MATIC) Plunges in BTC-Led Flush: Can It Hold Support?See how Axelar intends to revolutionize blockchain interoperability:How Axelar Intends To Connect Bitcoin With Over 65 Other Chains

CFTC Chair Predicts Tsunami Of Crypto Enforcement Actions In Next 2 Years | Bitcoinist.com


								As the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) continues to scrutinize crypto industry players, including Robinhood, Binance, Coinbase, and Ripple, the Chair of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC), Rostin Behnam, warns of an impending surge in enforcement actions. 
Crypto Faces Inevitable Wave Of Enforcement Actions
At the Milken Institute’s 27th annual Global Conference, Behnam emphasized the lack of regulatory framework and transparency within the growing crypto industry, which he believes will inevitably lead to more fraud and manipulation cases.
Behnam anticipates a “cycle of enforcement actions” within the next six months to two years, driven by the rapid appreciation of digital assets and heightened interest from retail investors. 

As a regulator, Behnam expresses concerns about the absence of clear rules and tools typically employed by regulators to maintain market integrity. Without proper regulations in place, Behnam argues that fraud and manipulation will persist.
The recent issuance of a Wells Notice by the SEC against Robinhood further highlights the regulatory pressure faced by industry players. 
Dan Gallagher, Chief Legal, Compliance, and Corporate Affairs Officer at Robinhood, expressed disappointment in the SEC’s decision, asserting that the assets listed on their platform are not securities. Gallagher remains confident in Robinhood’s position and its commitment to regulatory compliance.
SEC Commissioner Hester Peirce, on the other hand, is known for her pro-crypto stance. She has previously criticized the lack of clear rules and the SEC’s skeptical approach towards cryptocurrencies. Peirce advocates for improved and updated regulatory frameworks that allow the industry to thrive and encourage innovation.
CFTC And SEC Lock Horns 
During his remarks, Behnam further emphasized that without action from Congress and increased regulatory transparency, enforcement agencies are likely to resort to lawsuits. 
The CFTC Chair acknowledges the challenges of getting legislation passed but notes the momentum and desire from lawmakers to close regulatory gaps, particularly in stablecoin legislation.
The ongoing interagency conflict between the CFTC and the SEC regarding classifying major cryptocurrencies further complicates regulatory matters. 
The CFTC recognizes cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Litecoin as commodities, while the SEC’s current stance, led by Chair Gary Gensler, limits the commodity classification solely to Bitcoin. 
This discrepancy has sparked debates within the industry, with legal experts suggesting that the CFTC’s position challenges the SEC’s authority.

The need for comprehensive regulatory frameworks becomes increasingly apparent as the crypto industry continues to evolve and gain mainstream attention. 
The outcome of ongoing enforcement actions and regulatory developments will significantly shape the industry’s future, impacting market participants and investors.

BlackRock, Ondo, Superstate: The Biggest Movers in the RWA Sector in Q1

While still early, the RWA space is one to watch closely as a potentially significant growth driver for crypto in the coming years. If these trends continue, tokenized real-world assets in the trillions by 2030, as predicted by Superstate's Leshner, may not be so far-fetched after all.

                        One in five voters in key states believe that cryptocurrencies are a critical issue in the 2024 US elections amidst Donald Trump and Joe Biden’s race for the presidency, according to Digital Currency Group (DCG) Tuesday report.“Crypto Attitudes in Swing States” report, released in collaboration with global consulting firm The Harris Poll, revealed that digital assets could play a major role in this year’s elections.Crypto Is A Large Issue In Upcoming US Elections, Digital Currency Group Says
According to the data, an estimated 20% of all voters in swing states say that crypto is a major issue they are considering when deciding their vote this year.In addition, almost half (48%) of voters surveyed say that they are distrustful of candidates interfering with crypto, while 30% said they are more likely to vote for pro-crypto politicians.“The recent poll conducted by Harris and DCG confirms what many in the industry have suspected: digital assets have emerged as a significant issue in the upcoming election,” said Blockchain Association CEO Kristin Smith. “Additionally, over one quarter (26%) of voters indicate that they are actively weighing political candidates’ positions on digital assets when making their decisions.”Voters Concerned Politicians May Stifle Crypto Innovation
The survey results follow a regulatory crackdown on the crypto industry initiated by United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) Chair Gary Gensler.Under Gensler, the SEC has sued various blockchain firms regarding U.S. securities law despite failing to provide the crypto sector with a clear regulatory framework.Meanwhile, U.S. lawmakers have failed to pass laws regulating crypto assets effectively, increasing political gridlock.According to DCG, most voters said they do not believe policymakers adequately understand blockchain technology and more than 50% are concerned that leaders are stifling innovation due to overregulation.“This data shows crypto is top of mind for voters in swing Senate states and that a pro-crypto position is a net positive for policymakers and candidates,” said Julie Stitzel, Senior Vice President of Policy at DCG. “The poll also underscores a strong desire for policymakers to establish reasonable regulations that protect consumers without stifling innovation.”DCG’s report may prove critical as tensions mount over the 2024 presidential election, with voters split almost equally between the two purported candidates. Republican frontrunner Donald Trump has taken a pro-crypto stance, while incumbent Democratic candidate Joe Biden has called for greater regulation in the industry.If each candidate wants to advance in the polls, DCG’s report suggests they might need to address the crypto community’s concerns.

Michelle Obama and RFK Jr. Have Equal Odds of Becoming Next President on Polymarket - Decrypt

We do the research, you get the alpha!Get exclusive reports and access to key insights on airdrops, NFTs, and more! Subscribe now to Alpha Reports and up your game!Go to Alpha ReportsCrypto traders think former first lady Michelle Obama—who is not running nor likely to announce a late bid to return to the White House—has just as good a shot at winning the 2024 U.S. presidential election as declared candidate and crypto proponent Robert F. Kennedy Jr.So far, traders have bet $8 million on Obama’s prospects through the decentralized prediction platform Polymarket. Millions of dollars have been wagered on other names too, but with Polymarket assigning her a 4% chance of success, she’s technically a top-three pick, rivaling candidates that have actually campaigned.That includes Kennedy, who declared his independence from the Democratic Party in October. Garnering $6.7 million in bets on Polymarket, the nephew of former President Kennedy has cozied up to crypto consistently—floating ideas from backing the U.S. dollar with Bitcoin to putting the entire U.S. budget on the blockchain to spur government accountability.Traditional political polling tracked by The Hill shows that Kennedy’s chances are fading among regular voters as he attempts to challenge party candidates President Biden and Former President Donald Trump. The political media site said Kennedy has the support of about 8.5% of voters, and that Trump did not want to debate him because “he’s not a serious candidate.”Still, the order book on Polymarket for Kennedy shows over a dozen bets of $25,000 or more hoping that he emerges victorious at the ballot box. Compare that to a handful of bets backing Obama to the tune of $5,000, with $7,500 the largest wager.Obama’s office said in March that a run for office isn’t in the cards for 2024. “As former First Lady Michelle Obama has expressed several times over the years, she will not be running for president,” a director of communications for Obama’s office told NBC News.The spokesperson indicated that Obama will instead throw her political clout behind Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris. Notably, Harris has also attracted notable bets on Polymarket. With $4.4 million in wagers placed, crypto traders say she has a 1% shot of replacing her boss in November.Stay on top of crypto news, get daily updates in your inbox.

Huge Transaction from the PEPE Whale: Deeply Impacts Price - Bitcoin Sistemi


According to Onchain data, a large PEPE whale made a new move and made its impact felt on the price of memecoin.
According to data, a multisig wallet moved its 1.23 trillion PEPE to Binance. The value of this transaction for the whale was approximately $10.6 million. However, this action caused the price of PEPE to drop by approximately 5.2%. The altcoin has still not fully recovered from the impact of this decline.


The whale in question had been holding these PEPE tokens for only 3 days and closed his trade with a profit of 134 thousand dollars, which is a low amount compared to his capital. This shows that the whale made a profit of approximately 1.28%.

In another whale development, another wallet this time bought Fantom (FTM) token by selling Ethereum. Whale paid a total of $2.12 million in WETH and purchased 2.98 million FTM at $0.712. The whale in question made a profit of $1.67 million from the previous FTM transaction and the profit rate was 148%.





FTM is trading at $0.6926 at the time of writing this article.

Ethereum price lags due to ‘weaker capital rotation,’ but crypto macro uptrend remains

Etheruem's (ETH) price continues to underperform compared to Bitcoin’s 2024 gains, but Glassnode analysts suggest that brighter days could lie ahead.A “weaker capital rotation” is behind Ether’s price underperformanceData from Cointelegraph Markets Pro and TradingView shows that Ethereum has been underperforming Bitcoin over the last two years, resulting in a weaker ETH/BTC ratio, which reached a low of $0.04622 on May 1, the lowest since April 2021. ETH/BTC weekly chart. Source: TradingViewGlassnode said Ethereum’s under-performance this cycle relative to Bitcoin is due to a “measurable lag in speculative interest” from the STH cohort.The report defines the Short-Term Holder cohort as “investors who acquired their coins within the last 155 days and are often considered a proxy for new investor demand.”Glassnode analysts explained that BTC experienced a “noticeable increase in speculative activity” in terms of capital accumulation among STHs in the run-up to all-time highs in March. This has not been reflected in ETH, which is yet to breach its previous all-time high. The firm’s on-chain data reveals that while Bitcoin’s STH-Realized Cap is nearly at the same level as the last bull run peak, ETH’s STH-Realized Cap is still less than half of previous cycle levels, suggesting a markedly lackluster inflow of new capital.“In many ways, this lack of new capital inflows is a reflection of the under-performance of ETH relative to BTC.”ETH’s STH-Realized Cap. Source: GlassnodeRelated: Bitcoin exchange inflows drop to 10-year lows after $74K all-time highsThe market is in the “early stages of a macro uptrend”Historically, Ether’s price performance has been closely linked to Bitcoin price moves, and the recent price action reflects this relationship. Bitcoin experienced a sell-off after the fourth halving, dropping 11% to a two-month low of $56,500 on May 1. Bitcoin’s price has since recovered, consolidating within the $62,700 and $65,550 price range over the last two days. BTC/USD daily chart. Source: TradingViewEther experienced a similar correction after the halving with a 6% drop, recording the “worst post-halving performance” ever, according to Glassnode. Ether price performance after halving. Source: GlassnodeHowever, measured from the $73,835 all-time high, glass notes that Bitcoin’s price fell by 20.3% – the deepest correction on a closing basis since the FTX lows in Nov-2022. “That said, this macro uptrend still appears to be one of the more resilient in history, with comparatively shallow corrections thus far.”Using the Net Unrealized Profit/Loss (NUPL) metric, the on-chain data analytics firm found that both Ether and BTC still have a relatively low Realized Cap associated with Long-Term Holders (LTHs), suggesting the market is “within the early stages of a macro uptrend.”Bitcoin vs. Ether Unrealized profit and loss. Source: GlassnodeIn an earlier report, Glassnode established that capital inflows into ETH tend to lag behind those into BTC. For instance, during the 2021 cycle, the peak influx of new capital into BTC occurred 20 days before the peak influx into ETH. Using a 30-day change in the Realized Cap to monitor the rotation of capital between these two assets, Glassnode analysts found that ETH STH Realized Cap is yet to pick up momentum in the current cycle. “For both assets, the Short-Term Holder variant peaked before the 2021 cycle top. This year, the BTC short-term holder Realized Cap has peaked around the new all-time high, while the ETH metric has hardly moved higher.”BTC vs. ETH STH Realized Cap. Source: GlassnodeGlassnode concludes that while the post-halving market action has played out remarkably similar to previous cycles, several data points indicate that Ether has underperformed relative to BTC.“When we break down capital flows and rotation between BTC and ETH, we can see that Bitcoin has received the lion's share of inflows, likely driven in part by the US spot ETFs. Short-term holders and speculation activity appear concentrated within Bitcoin, with a remarkably weak spill-over into Ethereum thus far.”This article does not contain investment advice or recommendations.

ICO Mega Dice (DICE) is a passive income gem, a fast-growing crypto casino platform combining GambleFi and GameFi.Mega Dice is one of web3’s fastest-growing crypto casinos, with over 50,000 players and 10,000 monthly active users.Across three seasons, Mega Dice will airdrop $2.25 million worth of tokens.As users scramble to qualify for the airdrop, crypto investors are pouring into Mega Dice’s recently launched DICE token presale.Web3 utility coin DICE is the native token of the Mega Dice casino platform. It offers access to limited edition NFTs and gives access, rewards, and benefits to its holders who use the casino.Most importantly, DICE holders who stake their tokens get a share of Mega Dice revenues, allowing them to benefit from the success of the crypto casino.It’s no surprise that crypto experts have been lining up to bulk up on this new web3 utility coin.Popular crypto analyst Michael Wrubel, who has over 310,000 subscribers, is highly bullish on DICE for 2024.VIDEOCheck Out Mega Dice Casino’s PresaleMega Dice (DICE) – Next Big Bitcoin Challenger?
Mega Dice’s presale has already attracted over $800,000 from early investors.DICE is currently priced at $0.069, valuing the token at a market cap of under $30 million.With Mega Dice becoming a major web3 leader, DICE could easily become a billion-dollar coin.Could it become the next big Bitcoin challenger?DICE and Bitcoin serve very different purposes, so the comparison is unfair.Bitcoin, the first, oldest, most secure, and most decentralized cryptocurrency globally, is fast being adopted as digital gold.Web3 utility coin DICE isn’t trying to compete with that. Rather, DICE is a leading Web3 coin that incorporates GambleFi and GameFi and offers passive income.35% of the token’s total supply is up for grabs in the presale. 15% is allocated to the airdrop.A further 10% is allocated to staking rewards.

Source: TradingViewHowever, Bitcoin found resistance at its 50DMA when it rallied to the mid-$65,000s on Monday.That’s the second time it has found resistance at the 50DMA since breaking below it in mid-April.That suggests that while Bitcoin’s short-term downtrend has been snapped, the bulls are yet to fully gain control.If Bitcoin continues to consolidate within its multi-month $56,000-74,000ish range in the months ahead, that wouldn’t be too surprising.Typically, it takes 4-6 months for the Bitcoin price to rally substantially beyond its pre-halving levels after the halving. The latest quadrennial halving just took place in April.That lines up well with Bitcoin’s normally tepid performance during the summer months.Assuming that there isn’t a sudden and sustained resurgence of spot Bitcoin ETF demand, and assuming that macro drivers remain limited as the market awaits the first Fed rate cuts, Bitcoin is likely to remain rangebound amid a post-halving/summer lull.Is Bitcoin the Best Crypto to Buy Now?
Q1 earnings reports have been touted as a potential positive driver for the cryptocurrency.The thinking is that companies might reveal growing BTC holdings, pointing to increased adoption post the launch of Bitcoin ETFs.Indeed, $429 billion asset manager Susquehanna International just reported owning $831 million BTC across 10 ETFs.The theme of growing adoption by major companies/financial institutions, as expressed through ETF demand, will continue to be a major driver in the ongoing BTC bull market.That’s one reason to remain optimistic that Bitcoin could surpass $100,000 this year or next.Further reasons include Bitcoin’s past history of posting parabolic price increased in the years following the halving, plus Fed easing.The coming consolidation period within $56,000-$74,000 ranges should be viewed as an opportunity to accumulate.And dips below this range will likely be eaten up very quickly. On-chain analysis shows that Bitcoin whales have been gobbling up supply recently, as they double down amid the current consolidation.With Bitcoin set to post solid 2x gains with a year, it could be the best crypto to buy now.However, some investors will be targeting gains of 5x or more during the current bull market.These investors would be better served spending some time parsing through investment options in the altcoin market.Here are some big movers on Tuesday that might be the best crypto to buy now.AIOZ Network (AIOZ)
AIOZ Network (AIOZ) is the best-performing cryptocurrency in the top 100 by market capitalization on Tuesday.That’s according to CoinMarketCap, which last put the AIOZ price at $0.82, up 14% in the past 24 hours.Having now broken back above its 21 and 50DMAs, AIOZ is aiming at a recovery to its March highs. That could mean a quick 30% rally for the token.The Aioz Network is a Layer 1 blockchain enabling Ethereum and Cosmos interoperability, according to Coinbase.Aioz Network aims to enable instant finality and low transaction fees for applications such as file storage, live streaming, content delivery, and more.Interoperability is a major theme in crypto. If AIOZ can become a leader in this space, its market cap could go well above its current $900 million.Ethena (ENA)
Ethena (ENA), the DeFi protocol behind the innovative yield baring US dollar stablecoin USDe, just broke above its 21DMA.It was last up 8% in the past 24 hours as per CoinMarketCap and changing hands around $0.93.As per Coingecko, USDe has amassed a market cap of around $2.3 billion since its launch in early 2024.Having seemingly now snapped its downtrend from the March highs, ENA could soon pump back to its $1.50 record highs.Quick 60% gains for the Ethena (ENA), making it potentially the best to buy now.

Swiss National Bank Favors Tokenized Assets


The Swiss National Bank (SNB) is at the forefront of integrating cutting-edge technology in the financial sector. At a recent summit in Basel, SNB Chairman Thomas Jordan unveiled the bank’s strategic move towards asset tokenization.
Jordan outlined that the SNB assesses various methods to facilitate transactions using tokenized assets through central bank money. This approach not only aims to eliminate credit and liquidity risks but also reinforces the stability of the monetary system. 
Asset Tokenization Over CBDCs
The project, known as Helvetia III, involves live pilots where participating banks utilize Swiss franc wholesale central bank digital currency (CBDC) to settle transactions with tokenized bonds on the SIX Digital Exchange (SDX).
Chair Jordan emphasized that settling transactions in central bank money is essential for maintaining financial stability. He highlighted the SNB’s pioneering role in leveraging blockchain technology to improve the operational efficiency of financial markets.


“If the tokenisation of assets becomes mainstream, settlement in central bank money will be crucial. This will allow central bank money to maintain its essential role as the anchor of the monetary system and to continue to serve as a safe means of payment,” Jordan stated. 

Helvetia III represents a significant leap forward in the SNB’s digital innovation. Since its inception in December 2023, it has successfully facilitated multiple bond issuances and secondary market transactions. This marks a milestone in demonstrating the practical utility of wholesale CBDCs in a real-world environment.

Read more: What is Tokenization on Blockchain?
Chairman Jordan also discussed alternative settlement methods to wholesale CBDC, focusing on linking tokenized asset platforms with the Swiss RTGS system and utilizing privately issued token money, which is bankruptcy-protected and fully backed by sight deposits at the SNB. 
Each method has its own governance challenges, but they collectively aim to address fragmentation issues in financial markets.
The SNB’s exploration into tokenization and its potential implications for monetary policy and financial stability reflects a proactive approach to technological advancements. By assessing the risks and benefits of these technologies, the SNB aims to determine the effective strategies for their implementation. It seeks to ensure that innovation aligns with its mandate of maintaining monetary and financial stability.

Crypto Billionaire Joseph Lubin Says SEC’s Anti-Crypto Agenda To Have ‘Chilling Effect’ on Ethereum Users - Here’s Why - The Daily Hodl


								Ethereum co-founder Joseph Lubin is issuing a warning about the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), saying the regulator’s current policies on crypto will have a lasting effect on the industry.
In a new interview with Wired, Lubin says that if ETH is declared a security by the SEC, people in the US won’t be able to buy it, and developers won’t be able to develop Ethereum or build any more applications on top of the protocol.










Earlier this year, SEC Chair Gary Gensler refused to confirm whether or not he sees ETH as a security.
Says Lubin,
“If the SEC is able to make it stick, it will have a chilling effect on users of Ethereum across America…
If the US has its way, it might use its long arm of the law to reach into different countries around the world and create pressure to reduce access to decentralized protocols and financial disintermediation.
We don’t want to feel like we are being pushed out by an irrational or imprudent regulator. We need to stand our ground.”
Lubin is the CEO of Consensys, the creators of MetaMask, the world’s most popular crypto wallet, which recently received a Wells Notice from the SEC, which the regulator issues when it wants to warn of a coming enforcement action.
Consensys soon responded with a lawsuit against the SEC, which Lubin, whose worth was estimated to be between $1 billion and $5 billion in 2018 by Forbes, says aims to prevent the regulator from reclassifying ETH as a security.
“Our action relates to MetaMask. But it stands alone, too. The SEC has been gaslighting the industry for quite a while, essentially declaring internally that ETH is a security and enforcing that secret notion. It would continue to do that, I believe, unless we brought an independent action that stands alone on its own merits and gets at the heart of the matter: the SEC wants to reclassify ETH.
It’s hard to land a technological paradigm shift into a society that feels like everything is operating just fine. In past decades, internet technology caused confusion and required lots of dialogue and open-mindedness. In the US, safe harbors were created to enable web technology to flourish, which had a profoundly transformative effect.
This time around, I’m pretty sure it’s going to work out fine. But we’re in that really painful stage where there is resistance.”

Ethena’s USDe To Be Integrated Into Third Largest Global Crypto Exchange Bybit - The Daily Hodl


								A new Ethereum (ETH)-based USD-pegged stablecoin is getting a boost from one of the world’s largest crypto exchanges.
Ethena Labs has announced that USDe, the stablecoin of the Ethena (ENA) ecosystem, is being integrated by Bybit, the third largest crypto exchange by trading volume.










“We are excited to share one of the most important developments for USDe adoption to date.
As of this week, USDe will be integrated throughout Bybit, beyond the current USDe/USDT spot pair.
Those new integrations include:
USDe as a collateral asset to trade perpetual futures, allowing Bybit users to potentially earn a yield paid by Bybit on their USD-pegged collateral while trading any of your favorite tokens including BTC, ETH, SOL and ENA.
BTC and ETH – USDe zero-fee spot pairs
USDe launch within the Bybit’s ‘Earn’ platform”
As explained in the post, USDe will be used on Bybit as collateral for perpetual futures, as a spot trading pair for Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum, and as part of the trading platform’s Earn program.
Ethena Labs bills USDe as an industry-first scalable synthetic dollar. USDe aims to maintain its USD peg with ETH and BTC backing.
Since the announcement this morning, ENA, the governance token of the Ethena blockchain, ENA has fallen 2.8%, currently trading for $0.954. However, ENA is still up 9% in the last 24 hours.

High Networth Bitcoin Whales Accumulating: Will This Buying Spree Push BTC Above $74,000?


								While Bitcoin continues to trade within the $60,000 to $70,000 range, a new wave of optimism is emerging from on-chain analysis. Willy Woo, an on-chain analyst, took to X on May 7 to point out an exciting development: high-net-worth BTC holders have been rapidly accumulating the coin. 
High Net-worth Whales Accumulating
In a chart, the analyst noted that whales, entities holding between 100 and 1,000 BTC, have been gobbling up BTC over the past two months. Their involvement, Woo says, has been the “strongest buying spree” by such whales in recent history. 
BTC whales accumulating | Source: Willy Woo via X
However, while there is excitement, some argue that this cohort’s sharp spike in BTC accrual could be due to spot Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) issuers. Since the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) approved the first spot ETFs in January, these issuers, including Fidelity, Bitwise, and ProShares, now control over 850,000 BTC.

Even so, Woo counters this argument, emphasizing that this uptick is not due to the involvement of these Wall Street players. The analyst explained that, based on available data, these entities are “distinct” and have been picked out through forensic clustering techniques. 
Moreover, Woo observes that publicly available spot ETF flow data reveals a discrepancy. For instance, while these whales have been purchasing BTC over the two months, amassing over 220,000 BTC according to network activity, spot ETF flows have been declining, only scooping up roughly 165,000 BTC during this period. 
This deviation suggests that investors, including institutions, gaining BTC exposure via spot ETFs cannot account for the entire whale activity. 
Bitcoin Buying Pressure Sustained, Will Bulls Break $73,800?
 
Additionally, Woo clarifies that the accumulation over the past two months wasn’t a single, massive purchase. Instead, the analyst explains, a clear pattern of sustained buying is observed over 30 days within two months. This makes it evident that their approach was deliberate, and they were eager to strategically accumulate when prices were depressed.

That whales are involved and actively buying, based on on-chain activity, is bullish. The coin has moved horizontally over the past two months since BTC prices peaked at $73,800. 

Early this month, Bitcoin prices plunged to as low as $56,500 before recovering steadily over the weekend. For the uptrend to remain, there must be a conclusive close above $70,000 and, ideally, $73,800. Analysts predict an eventual spike to $100,000.

Though charged in a different federal district, former Binance CEO Changpeng Zhao pleaded guilty to similar charges in November 2023. In April, Zhao was sentenced to four months in prison. His reporting date has yet to be scheduled.The U.S. Attorney’s Office did not announce a date for Todd’s sentencing hearing. According to his LinkedIn profile, he stepped down as CEO of the exchange in October 2022 and has been working as the lead developer at Digitex Games since February 2023.Related: Arrested Binance exec pleads not guilty to charges in NigeriaTodd announced in 2020 that there would be “no KYC identity verification requirements of any kind” following a data breach at Digitex.

Gary Gensler on Crypto Oversight, Auditing Frauds, and Market Manipulation | Cryptoglobe


                                
On May 7, 2024, U.S. SEC Chair Gary Gensler appeared on CNBC’s “Squawk Box” to discuss various pressing issues related to the oversight of the crypto market and several high-profile cases involving financial oversight and regulation. Below is a detailed analysis of his statements during this interview.



Oversight of the Crypto Market and SEC’s Role



Gary Gensler highlighted the SEC’s ongoing commitment to ensuring transparency and fairness in the crypto market. He emphasized the need for full, fair, and truthful information to be provided to investors, which he believes is not currently the case in the crypto sector. Gensler pointed out that if crypto products are securities, then they must adhere to the same rigorous standards as other securities, reinforcing the SEC’s role in protecting investors from misleading information.



Trump Media Auditor Charged with ‘Massive Fraud’



Gensler discussed the case of Trump Media’s auditor, BF Borgers, which was charged with massive fraud. He explained the importance of auditing standards, which BF Borgers failed to meet by not adequately reviewing their work and misleading clients. This case highlights the crucial role of auditors as gatekeepers in the financial system, ensuring the accuracy and reliability of public company disclosures.



Market Manipulation Concerns



In response to a question about the unusual stock movements of Trump Media & Technology Group Corp (NASDAQ: DJT) and other “meme stocks,” Gensler reiterated that market manipulation is illegal. He stressed that while investors are free to make their own decisions, these must be based on accurate disclosures, and any intent to manipulate market prices is not permissible.



Valuation Issues in Private Funds



Gensler touched on the broader issue of asset valuations within private funds, like those managed by Blackstone. He pointed out the necessity for fund advisors to adhere to appropriate valuation methods, ensuring that investors do not overpay and that redemptions are fair, underscoring the SEC’s role in maintaining the integrity of valuations in the investment industry.



Future Plans



When asked about his future, Gensler expressed his focus on his current role and the privilege of serving as the SEC Chair. He noted his commitment to continue in his role well into 2026, contributing to the robustness of American capital markets and protecting investor interests.

Earlier this week, Robinhood Markets, Inc. (Nasdaq: HOOD) announced that its subsidiary, Robinhood Crypto (RHC), had received a Wells Notice from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) staff. This notice indicates that the SEC is considering recommending an enforcement action against RHC. Robinhood, a prominent player in the financial technology space, has expressed disappointment in the SEC’s decision, emphasizing its long-standing efforts to work collaboratively with the agency to achieve regulatory clarity in the crypto industry.




VIDEO




Dan Gallagher, Chief Legal, Compliance and Corporate Affairs Officer at Robinhood, underscored the company’s dedication to constructive engagement with the SEC over the years. Robinhood has actively sought guidance from the regulator, including its noted initiative to “come in and register” with the SEC. Nevertheless, the receipt of the Wells Notice has left the company disheartened yet resolute in defending its practices.



Robinhood Crypto asserts that the digital assets offered on its platform are not securities. The company has deliberately avoided listing certain tokens and offering services like lending and staking—activities the SEC has challenged as securities in previous cases against other platforms. 



In response to the SEC’s urging, Robinhood endeavored to register a special purpose broker-dealer with the commission, a move demonstrating its willingness to align with regulatory expectations.



Despite facing possible enforcement, Robinhood is confident about its legal position and is ready to robustly engage with the SEC to reinforce its case. The company believes that the facts and the law support its position and is prepared to expose the flaws in any potential case against Robinhood Crypto.



Robinhood has assured its customers that their accounts and the services provided by the platform will not be affected by this development.

Philosopher Yuval Noah Harari warns of AI’s risks in finance

The unbridled use of artificial intelligence in the financial system could lead to dire results, author, philosopher and history professor Yuval Noah Harari told an audience at the Bank for International Settlements (BIS) Innovation Summit. Strong institutions are needed to keep AI in check, he said.The financial system creates trust, Harari argued. Money, bonds and other financial devices allow millions of strangers to work together toward common goals. But no effort has been made to make financial regulation understandable “to humans,” he said:“Maybe 1% of the population understands how the financial system works. What happens when that number goes down to zero?”Harari cited the financial crisis of 2007-2008 as an outcome of incomprehensible financial innovation. Regulators were unable to understand new financial products well enough to regulate them.Related: Decentralized AI is key to more unbiased AI algorithms — Masa co-founderAI is an alien form of intelligence that is only at the beginning of its evolution. It does not reason the way humans do and could easily create financial devices that are beyond human imagination, shifting power away from politicians and regulators to algorithms. Trust relationships would be built between AI systems rather than between people, and in a financial crisis, politicians and regulators would be forced to trust AI. Yuval Noah Harari addressing an audience at the BIS Innovation Summit remotely. Source: YouTubeThat disruption of trust relationships could lead to social instability. Trust in politicians and institutions is already declining, Harari noted, adding:“We need to prevent AI from becoming completely unfathomable. […] We need the ability to understand it and regulate it.”Regulation should not be left to geniuses or “charismatic leaders,” Harari continued. Only institutions can “keep humans in the loop.” Source: Yuval Noah HarariEven then, there are dangers. World-changing innovations are often successful only after a series of failed attempts to use them. Harari described imperialism, communism and Nazism as failed attempts to build industrialized societies — with tens of millions of victims. Meanwhile, AI is capable of coming up with ideas about how to use itself. Harari said regulators need to concentrate on building more trust between people to ensure the future financial system is stable and human-friendly.Magazine: What the hell is Web3 anyway?

Trump’s Return: What It Could Mean for Bitcoin, Explained by Standard Chartered | Cryptoglobe


                                
As reported by CoinDesk, Standard Chartered’s recent research delves into the implications of U.S. fiscal policies and their potential impact on the cryptocurrency market. The investment bank’s analysis suggests that the growing risk of U.S. fiscal dominance, characterized by the monetization of government debt by the Federal Reserve, could bolster the appeal of cryptocurrencies as alternative assets.



Standard Chartered highlights a scenario where increasing fiscal dominance might lead to a supportive environment for cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin. According to the bank’s report, such economic conditions could make Bitcoin an attractive hedge against potential de-dollarization and waning confidence in the U.S. Treasury market. Geoff Kendrick, an analyst at Standard Chartered, notes that this situation would likely result in a steeper nominal 2-year/10-year U.S. Treasury curve, a greater increase in breakevens compared to real yields, and a rise in term premium. Notably, Kendrick points out that the Bitcoin price has a positive correlation with these potential financial developments.







            
            

            
            

            
            

        

The prospect of Donald Trump winning a second term as U.S. President could also influence the cryptocurrency landscape significantly. Standard Chartered suggests that a second Trump administration might accelerate the withdrawal of foreign official buyers from the U.S. Treasury market due to fiscal concerns, a trend that was evident during Trump’s first term. The bank contrasts the average annual net selling of U.S. government debt during Trump’s presidency ($207 billion) with that during Biden’s ($55 billion), illustrating a substantial difference that could impact fiscal policies and market reactions.



Further, the bank anticipates that Trump’s potential reelection could lead to a more supportive regulatory environment for digital assets. This support could manifest in looser regulations and the approval of U.S. spot Exchange Traded Funds (ETFs) for other cryptocurrencies, which would likely provide a significant boost to the market. This proactive support, combined with the passive boost from de-dollarization, positions Bitcoin and other digital assets for potentially increased valuation and broader adoption.



According to CoinDesk’s article, Standard Chartered maintains an optimistic outlook on Bitcoin’s price amid these analyses, reiterating its target of $150,000 by the end of the year and $200,000 by the end of 2025.

Neuralink Safety Concerns Drove Co-Founder to Break Up With Elon Musk - Decrypt

A neurosurgeon and co-founder of Elon Musk's biotech company Neuralink says he left the seven-year-old firm because he felt there was a safer way to connect human brains to computers.“I've pretty much devoted my entire professional life to bringing neural interfaces from the world of science to the world of medicine,” Dr. Benjamin Rapoport said in a recent Wall Street Journal podcast interview. “But I felt that in order to move to the world of medicine and technology, safety is paramount.”Neuralink’s approach to brain-computer interfaces (BCI) requires the insertion of many electrodes into the brain’s tissue, which Rapoport says brings unnecessary risks for the patient.“Those (electrodes) have the drawback of doing some amount of brain damage when they're inserted into the brain, and I felt that it was possible to extract information-rich data from the brain without damaging the brain,” he explained.Rapoport has since founded his own company, Precision Neuroscience, hoping to achieve equivalent results with non-invasive technology.The Neuralink approach has raised alarm both inside and outside the company, starting with its treatment of early test subjects. Inspectors from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) raised concerns about poor animal welfare controls at Neuralink observed during inspections of the company's California laboratory in 2021 and 2022.Furthermore, according to company records reviewed by Reuters, since 2018, Neuralink has killed roughly 1,500 animals in its attempts to successfully connect brains to computer interfaces.The company nonetheless received FDA approval to begin human trials, and began actively recruiting for human test subjects in late September. Neuralink reported inserting a chip into its first living human in January.The patient reportedly remained healthy with no adverse results, but experts from the Physicians Committee for Responsible Medicine have urged Neuralink to halt all animal and human experiments and instead focus on non-invasive brain-computer interfaces.The battle for brain supremacyPrecision Neuroscience, founded by Rapoport in 2021 after his departure from Neuralink, is focused on using surface microelectrodes that coat the brain's surface without penetrating it.“For a medical device, safety often implies minimal invasiveness, and in the early days of brain-computer interfaces, there was this notion that in order to extract information-rich data from the brain, one needed to penetrate the brain with tiny little needle-like electrodes,” Rapaport said.This is no longer the case, he added, outlining his new company's methods.“At precision, the physical interface with the brain is a thin film about a quarter of the width of a human eyelash that conforms to the undulating surface of the brain,” Rapoport explained on the podcast. “And inside that thin film are embedded tiny little platinum micro electrodes, each one about the size of a neuron.”These electrodes are arranged in a lattice pattern on the brain's surface, detecting electrical signals while filtering out noise, he said. The data is then compressed, transmitted externally, and translated into intelligible form by machine learning software calibrated to each individual's unique brain signals.While Neuralink's approach may offer access to a larger trove of neural data, Precision Neuroscience's method could mitigate the risks associated with invasive procedures, Rappoport asserted.The two-time neurotech founder said he is optimistic about the overall potential of brain-computer interfaces, calling them a “platform technology” that could enable new applications in different fields as interfaces improve. BCIs will start becoming more common for medical patients in the next few years and could eventually change the way healthy people interact with computers, too, according to Rapoport.“With brain-computer interface technology, we think we will be able to enable smooth, intuitive functionality that will allow [a disabled person] to type, use PowerPoint, use Excel, surf the internet, send email, do all the things that the average worker can do—perhaps even better,” he said.As with any breakthrough medical tech, however, BCIs are as expensive as they are promising. Rapoport explains that the costs come from the huge amounts of research and development required to implement these procedures safely and at scale.Still, he said, we can’t rule out a future where these enhancements are widely available, adding that Precision Neuroscience aims to make its tech as accessible as possible without losing its moral compass.“It's very important to all of us that the technology be accessible and affordable,” he concluded. ”We're committed to the price point not being a barrier to entry.”Edited by Ryan Ozawa.Stay on top of crypto news, get daily updates in your inbox.

Ethereum Network Growth Spikes Again in Bullish Sign for Price - DailyCoin


        
The Ethereum network has seen a significant growth spike over the weekend.



The network growth offers greater confidence in the asset’s price prospects.



Ethereum experienced a similar trend at the end of April 2024.
Ethereum continues to show strong fundamentals.
Recently, crypto assets, including ETH, have bounced around without clear direction. Amid the doldrums, however, the Ethereum network is showing signs of strength with recent significant spikes in network growth, first at the end of April 2024 and now over the weekend as crypto asset prices rebounded from a week-long downturn.Ethereum Sees Largest Single-Day Wallet Growth In Two YearsOn Monday, May 6, crypto analytical platform Santiment Feed disclosed that nearly 200,000 new Ethereum addresses were created on May 4, the most significant single-day growth in almost two years since October 8, 2022. The spike in network growth came as crypto assets, including ETH, rallied over the weekend, buoyed by a weak U.S. jobs report that hinted that interest rate cuts from the Federal Reserve may not be a far-flung dream after all.As highlighted by Santiment, the recent network growth is a bullish sign for ETH. This is because it indicates significant investor interest and potential for increased capital inflows should macroeconomic conditions align.According to CoinGecko data at the time of writing, ETH is trading at $3,035, representing a 1.6% decline in the past 24 hours.

SEC’s Gary Gensler Reiterates Belief That Vast Majority Of Cryptocurrencies Are Securities ⋆ ZyCrypto

&nbsp

&nbsp
Gary Gensler, the Chairman of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, has doubled down on his view that most cryptocurrencies qualify as securities. Gensler added that he doesn’t believe investors have the appropriate disclosures for investing in such assets.



Gensler Strident In His View That Most Cryptos Are Securities



The crypto industry crackdown is continuing swiftly, with popular trading platform Robinhood Crypto joining the growing list of firms issued with a Wells Notice action by the SEC this week.



During an appearance on CNBC’s Squawk Box on Tuesday, Gensler would not divulge any details on the Robinhood case, but he indicated that his agency was going after crypto because it boasts an “outsized” share of financial scams and fraud.



“Crypto is a small piece of our overall markets,” the SEC boss said. “But it’s an outsized piece of the scams and frauds and problems in our markets — because without prejudging any one token, much of this field is noncompliant with the protections of our securities laws.”



He reiterated his stance that most cryptocurrencies fit the definition of securities.

&nbsp



“Many of these tokens are securities under the law of the land (as interpreted by the U.S. Supreme Court). So, we follow that law,” Gensler emphasized.



According to the SEC chair, investors are not receiving the required disclosures about those assets. 



So, Is Ethereum A Potential Security Or Commodity?



Ether — the industry’s second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization — has long been debated regarding its classification as a potential security despite the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) constantly classifying it as a commodity.



Gensler first hinted at the potential ether (ETH) designation as a security in September 2022. The SEC boss suggested proof-of-stake (PoS) tokens could be securities, following the Ethereum blockchain’s monumental transition to that security model from proof-of-work (PoW).



When asked about the SEC’s position during the CNBC interview, Gensler refused to answer definitively how ether should be classified.



“All I would say is, to me, the fundamental question is how do we ensure that the American investor is protected?” Gensler opined. “Right now, they’re not getting the required or needed disclosures, and the intermediaries in the center of this rather centralized market generally are conflicted and doing things we would never allow the New York Stock Exchange to do.”



Notably, the SEC is yet to publicly declare ether a security. However, recent reports revealed that the Gensler-helmed commission has considered the cryptocurrency a security for over a year.



The SEC’s position on Ethereum comes at a crucial time, as the top regulator mulls whether to approve or deny several applications for spot ETH ETFs. The SEC has repeatedly deferred its decision on proposals from prominent asset managers, including BlackRock, Fidelity, and Franklin Templeton.



With an important deadline expected in late May, ETF analysts remain pessimistic about the odds of approval.

Perp DEX trading volume hits new heights with 395% annual surge - Crypto Briefing




Decentralized perpetual contracts exchanges (perp DEX) registered an all-time high in monthly trading volume in March at $317 billion, according to data aggregator DefiLlama. Despite a slight slump in April to $304 billion, the volume managed to stay above the $300 billion mark and represents a 395% year-on-year growth.Imran Mohamad, CMO at Zeta Markets, points to different reasons behind the perp DEX rising momentum. The first one is the developments made within the decentralized finance (DeFi) ecosystem since the “DeFi Summer” happened in 2020.“I think DeFi Summer happened, and then you can start seeing a lot more DeFi innovation. And I think now you can see that DeFi is starting to gain a lot more prominence and interest, especially led by ecosystems like Solana, where they really focus on a unified user experience and making it easier for people to onboard,” stated Mohamad. “So you have all these enabling a lot more accessible transactions, a lot more accessible, they enable a lot more user-facing DApps to operate.”Perp DEX monthly volumes. Image: DefiLlamaSolana shows the largest growth in derivatives trading volume in the last 30 days, jumping 244%, while it shows the second-largest weekly leap. Zeta Markets is the major driving force behind this growth in the perp DEX sector, as its volume soared by 397% in the last 30 days and 188% in the past week, suggesting gradual and sustainable growth.Moreover, Mohamad mentions the current airdrop mania and its points system, which consists of protocols rewarding users for interacting with their products. This strategy is commonly applied by perp DEX, and the results can be seen in the Ethereum layer-2 blockchain Blast numbers.Through points rewards offered by different perp DEX in their ecosystem, Blast managed to soar in derivatives trading and it is dominating weekly volumes for the third consecutive week.“The points are feeding a lot of retail interest, because people go ‘okay, if I have points, I get it, I understand what I need to do.’ Before, this was coded, like hidden messages in what the protocols were saying. And now with points, retail users know what they can work with,” shared Mohamad.Competing with centralized exchangesCentralized exchanges Binance and OKX were responsible for over $70 billion in derivatives trading volume in the last 24 hours, almost 25% of the April trading volume registered by perp DEX. This highlights how centralized platforms are still significantly more popular when it comes to derivatives trading.However, Mohamad sees two DeFi features that could start capturing more retail investors using centralized exchanges currently, the first one being self-custody.“In a centralized exchange, I don’t have access or custody of my assets. So no matter what happens, we can never fully prevent another FTX from happening. It’s not because the technology is ineffective. It’s not because regulators can’t do the job. It’s because that is an inherent flaw in custody.”The second feature mentioned by Zeta Markets’ CMO is the possibility users have to influence perp DEX decisions through governance tokens. Mohamad uses Zeta Markets’ soon-to-launch native token Z, which will have a vote escrow model consisting of users being able to influence what affects them directly.“What features should we include? Where should we direct rewards? How should we direct rewards? So these are things that if I’m a centralized exchange trader today, I cannot influence. I have zero say in how rewards are distributed. I have zero say in what’s going to happen in the protocol. I think you see what Jupiter has been doing with their working group proposals, they’ve done an extremely great job to get the community involved in working groups.”Nevertheless, he highlights that DeFi must go through multiple developments in its infrastructure to really compete with the centralized ecosystem, such as lower-latency transactions and better price accuracy.

Why Grayscale's Bitcoin Spot ETF, Which Has Seen 78 Days of Outflows, Is Starting to See Net Inflows? Here Are The Theories - Bitcoin Sistemi


Grayscale's spot Bitcoin ETF recently broke its 78-day outflow streak, recording two days of net inflows in a row. The sudden change in the fund's performance sparked controversy among market analysts.
While Bloomberg ETF Analyst James Seyffart is unsure about the exact cause of the volatility, he suggested several possible explanations:



It could be a short-term tactical trade or some form of binary trading. “It may have happened over shorter time frames, where the transaction fee was much less important.”

Grayscale launched its ETF in January, turning its flagship GBTC fund into a spot Bitcoin ETF. At launch, the fund managed approximately $30 billion in assets. However, it later experienced a billion-dollar outflow. Notably, Grayscale's product charges a higher fee than competing funds issued by firms like BlackRock and Fidelity.

Seyffart also speculated about the reasons for the recent entries:






“If market makers are using GBTC as part of market making, this could result in inflows. “It could also be one of those platforms where GBTC is the only approved means to gain spot Bitcoin access.”

While recent inflows into Grayscale's fund did not significantly impact the “big picture,” Seyffart noted that overall capital flowing into U.S.-based spot BTC ETFs appears to have diminished somewhat amid a more stagnant Bitcoin market.
However, in a recent development, it was revealed that the trading company Susquehanna International Group purchased over 1 billion dollars of BTC from the GBTC product. This may be a factor affecting the inflows into GBTC.

Macro headwinds could spur a ‘boring’ bitcoin summer - or something worse - Blockworks


Bitcoin is no longer merely that taboo thing your techie uncle awkwardly brings up at family gatherings.
Well, maybe the asset is only that for you — but if so, you’re in the minority at this point. 
Whether you believe in bitcoin or not, it has increasingly perforated traditional finance in recent years and months. Institutions can gain exposure to crypto through a regulated liquid derivatives market, and more recently via bitcoin ETFs.
While some traditional finance bigwigs still criticize the asset (at least publicly), large financial companies are waking up to the potential of BTC, as well as blockchain tech more broadly.
“Before, people had to buy coins,” said Lucas Kiely, chief investment officer at Yield App. “Now they can trade on [traditional finance] markets which means big market players can get involved.”
The increased market participation around bitcoin is one reason the asset has become more correlated to global markets — a fact that could spur investor concern in an environment like this one. 
That’s because a range of macro factors are set to continue tussling with post-halving bitcoin price rally expectations in the coming months, industry watchers say.
Bitcoin halvings — when per-block rewards for mining bitcoin are reduced every four or so years — have historically helped catalyze crypto bull markets. 
Read more: With halving just hours away, bitcoin price predictions proliferate 
Such events prior to the latest one last month have propelled BTC to new highs between 12 months and 18 months after the halving.
Before then, the macro environment this time around may push BTC downward.
Macro headwinds lingering
Though bitcoin has rebounded from its recent stint below $57,000, “investors should be wary of being lulled into a false sense of security,” Kiely noted.
The asset’s price hovered around $63,000 at 4 pm ET Tuesday — down 9% from a month ago, but up nearly 7% in the last five days.  
“The macro headwinds that pushed BTC south have not eased,” he said in an email. “If anything, global political uncertainty is only more pronounced, while inflation in the US is still not under control.”
K33 research analysts Anders Helseth and Vetle Lunde said in a Tuesday note that global macro conditions have “re-emerged to become a relevant market mover.” Bitcoin’s 30-day correlation to the S&P 500 has reached a seven-month high, they added.“BTC first followed the market down on increased interest rate expectations on Wednesday, before following the markets up on decreased interest rate expectations on Friday.
The analysts are referring to the “higher for longer” posture from the Federal Reserve last Wednesday, which held interest rates at their current level. 
Fed Chair Jerome Powell called the path forward “uncertain,” noting that central bankers will need to see more evidence that inflation is easing before cutting rates.
Two days later, bitcoin’s price rose on news that the economy added 175,000 positions in April — a number closer to the pre-pandemic monthly average of 183,000 job gains.
Read more: Bitcoin is back above $60K, stocks rally on cooler jobs data
The crypto market has been “consumed” in recent months by the first US spot bitcoin ETF launches and the Bitcoin halving, according to LMAX Group market strategist Joel Kruger.   
“As these risks have played out and the market has settled down, attention is shifting to the other side of the equation where there has been more pressing volatility risk around the state of the US dollar, yield differentials and the outlook for fiat monetary policy,” Kruger told Blockworks. 
Market participants previously expected the Fed to cut rates by 0.75% or 1% in 2024, Finequia International research analyst Matteo Greco said in a research note. 
After Powell’s comments last week, many now anticipate lower cuts amounting to 0.25% or 0.50% — and only if inflation doesn’t worsen.
How far down before a possible rally?
Outside of monetary policy, the war in the Middle East rages on, and the US domestic situation is “increasingly volatile” ahead of the November presidential election, Kiely said.
Oh yeah, and the Securities and Exchange Commission appears to be continuing its regulation-by-enforcement approach, with Robinhood most recently receiving a Wells notice. 
In other words, tailwinds for bitcoin are few and far between right now, Kiely added.
“Best case scenario, we will see a very boring summer,” he explained. “Worst case scenario, bitcoin will lose some key support and take a long journey back down to recent lows.”
Such a retreat could mean BTC sinking to between $50,000 and $55,000, Kiely predicts.
Aside from central bank policy developments, bitcoin investors should monitor the pace of traditional finance adoption of bitcoin ETFs, Kruger noted. Some institutions and corporations are also considering adding bitcoin to their balance sheet. 
“We believe any setbacks should be exceptionally well supported into the $50,000 area, with any dips below to be short-lived,” he said. “As far as the topside goes, we wouldn’t at all be surprised to see bitcoin making fresh record highs towards and through the next major barrier at $100,000.”

Bitcoin 'Epic Sat' That Sold for $2 Million Used to Inscribe Ordinals Art-With Grimes' AI Voice - Decrypt

A Bitcoin “epic satoshi,” or a particularly rare version of the smallest denomination of BTC, was sold for 33.3 BTC in April—around $2.1 million at the time. Now it has been used to inscribe an Ordinals asset with music and the AI-generated voice of Canadian electronic pop artist Grimes (aka Claire Boucher).An “epic satoshi,” or “epic sat,” is an extremely rare satoshi—that is, 1/100,000,000 of a BTC—that is generated during each Bitcoin halving. The quadrennial event cuts the amount of Bitcoin earned by miners (who support the network) in half. And those epic sats are said to be particularly valuable to collectors when NFT-like Ordinals are inscribed on them.Bitcoin Ordinals project Book of Blob inscribed its artwork on the latest epic sat via inscription 70,634,325, which was inscribed on Sunday. The “Spikes” collection inscribed from the epic satoshi comes by way of the pseudonymous Nuro, who says they’re a doctor turned Bitcoin enthusiast and founder of Nuro Realm, Cypherpunk Labs, and the Blob Army.Nuro explained that the "Spikes" collection delves into the exploration of the mind, brain, and reality while preserving consciousness on Bitcoin. He added that "Spike #1" was inscribed on the epic sat and was collaboratively created with software developers and Ordinals enthusiasts Eloc Remarc, Boppleton, and Steaktoshi.“We are experimental artists working at the intersection of art, science and technology, so it has been a dream of ours to put our work on an epic sat and inspire the community to experiment and create new art,” Nuro told Decrypt. “We believe everyone is an artist, you just have to find your medium.”“Spike #1,” Nuro said, is the first “neurogenerative” 3D audiovisual piece on Bitcoin Ordinals, and includes his inscribed brain data that manipulates the art in the inscription."Neurogenerative" is a riff on generative AI and neurographic art. Neurographic art refers to art designed to work with the subconscious mind. Projects like Neurotech startup Prophetic use generative AI to engage the subconscious mind and lucid dreams during sleep.Nuro said that the idea to use Grimes’ Elf Tech AI technology came after a spoken word project did not have the effect he wanted, and Eloc suggested he check out Grimes’ AI voice.“It is original art and music we made that uses Grimes’ free and open [Elf Tech] AI voice for a portion of the vocals,” Nuro said.In April 2023, Grimes announced the launch of Elf Tech and offered anyone who uses her voice a 50% royalty on AI-generated music using her voice. “Feel free to use my voice without penalty,” Grimes wrote on Twitter. In other words, Grimes isn’t personally involved in this project, but her tech is available for any creator to tap into.“I looked into it and saw she is a badass cypherpunk who said ‘Fuck copyright, use my voice without penalty,’” Nuro said, paraphrasing Grimes’ own statements. “So I experimented with it and loved the ethos and how it sounded to give a more cosmic and digital vibe. So I have been using it since then alongside my own voice and Steaktoshi’s.”Nuro said that while the Elf Tech program was easy to use, calling it fun and unpredictable, it wasn’t without its issues, including downtime and issues with uploading. Nuro isn’t new to the Bitcoin art world: In February, Cypherpunk Labs and Nuro Realm collaborated with Deezy Labs and Superchief Gallery to launch its San Francisco gallery dedicated to Bitcoin Ordinals art.In April, the latest of four “epic sats” was mined by Bitcoin mining pool ViaBTC and went up for auction on the cryptocurrency exchange CoinEX. It was expected to fetch a sizable sum, given that Ordinals collectors place a premium on assets derived from rare satoshis. And indeed, it ultimately saw a winning bid of 33.3 BTC, or $2.1 million worth at the time of sale.Following the inscription of the Spike #1 Ordinal, a “child” version was etched as the EPIC•EPIC•EPIC•EPIC Rune #66429 using the Runes token protocol that was launched at the halving by Ordinals creator Casey Rodarmor.Since the launch, EPIC•EPIC•EPIC•EPIC has seen just over $1 million worth of trading volume via prominent marketplace Magic Eden, with a market cap of nearly $50 million at the current price of 79 satoshis (about $0.05 worth of Bitcoin).Edited by Andrew HaywardStay on top of crypto news, get daily updates in your inbox.

Decoding PEPE's fall: Key factors behind the price decline - AMBCrypto



PEPE has seen a decrease of 6.02% in the past twenty-four hours.
Experts and investors are still heavily bullish on the meme coin.

Remember a few months ago when Pepe [PEPE] was all the rave? Well, that’s not the case anymore. Over the past twenty-four hours, Pepe has seen a decrease of over 6%, a huge tumble from its good days. 
Interestingly, however, data from CoinGecko shows that the community is still largely bullish on the prominent meme coin.
Why is PEPE Down?
Two days ago, Etherscan unleashed a bombshell with its on-chain data, revealing a massive withdrawal of nearly 1 trillion PEPE tokens from Binance [BNB]. 
This transfer, valued at almost $8 million, turned heads due to its mysterious origins and the use of a high-security Gnosis Safe Proxy wallet. And it wasn’t a one-off, either. 
Just a day before, the same shadowy address pulled out another 322.48 billion PEPE tokens, worth around $2.7 million. Take a look:
Source: Etherscan
These transfers seem to be the core reason behind the small FUD that led to PEPE’s plunge. Their timing is also quite intriguing, seeing as they happened during an unexpected 17% surge in prices. 
Investors remain unfazed. 
However, this has also fueled wild speculations in the community about the possible motives behind the transfers, ranging from market manipulation to unforeseen regulatory crackdowns.
Meanwhile, on the morning of the 7th of May, another whale made a deposit of over 1.2 billion PEPE tokens to a Binance multisignature wallet address, suggesting it might have been an entity and not an individual investor. 
Clearly, there is still a lot of interest in Pepe.
What Experts are saying
As usual, crypto experts are throwing around predictions for PEPE, trying to help investors make sense of the market and decide if it is still a good option for investment.
Take David Gokhshtein, for instance. 
The renowned crypto commentator believes that PEPE is still Dogecoin’s [DOGE] biggest competitor in the upcoming bull market that is largely expected to kick off in the third to fourth quarter of this year.
Some experts are even suggesting that HODLers swap out their Shiba Inu [SHIB] for PEPE, even at current price levels.

Moreover, Plazma has shared that in the past day, PEPE has seen seven hundred and three new holders. They added that the meme coin has,
 “Touched the 92 resistance. Won’t be long before a new all-time high.”
All in all, the community is still pretty bullish on PEPE even as it sees a rocky day. But whether you invest or not is a decision you have to make for yourself after doing your own extensive research.

Crypto Industry Flexes Financial Muscle With $100M Super PAC War Chest For 2024 US Elections | Bitcoinist.com


								A recent report by OpenSecrets.org revealed that cryptocurrency industry Super Political Action Committees (PACs) have accumulated a staggering $102 million war chest to exert their influence on the upcoming 2024 US congressional elections. 
The data, compiled by Public Citizen, highlights the sector’s concerted efforts to sway elections in favor of pro-crypto candidates and impede regulatory measures to ensure compliance within the industry.
Crypto Billionaires Lead Funding Surge
Rick Claypool, a research director for Public Citizen and author of the report, emphasized that a fresh wave of crypto corporations, executives, and their allies have returned to the political landscape, pouring millions of dollars into campaigns. 
Their objectives reportedly include influencing elections, supporting cryptocurrency-friendly candidates, and obstructing accountability measures to enforce industry regulations.

The report further discloses that over half of the funds raised originate from direct corporate expenditures, primarily attributed to Coinbase and Ripple Labs. 
The remaining contributions come from billionaire crypto executives and venture capitalists, including significant sums from the founders of venture capital firm Andreessen Horowitz, the Winklevoss twins, and Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong.
Of the eight corporate Super PAC donors, four have either settled or faced charges by the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) for alleged violations of securities laws. 
According to the report, the largest crypto Super PAC, Fairshake Political Action Committee, has resorted to running political ads that deliberately avoid any mention of cryptocurrencies, employing a “manipulative strategy” to sway voters.
The report also highlights the intervention of crypto Super PACs in primary races for the 2024 elections. Out of the six completed primaries, only one crypto-backed candidate suffered defeat. 
However, eleven primary races involving crypto-backed candidates are still ongoing. Moreover, the crypto Super PACs have pledged to allocate funds to Senate races in Ohio and Montana, two crucial battleground states in the general election.
Voters In ‘Swing States’ Demand Reasonable Regulations
A separate study conducted by Digitial Currency Group (DCG), a global investor in blockchain companies, found that more than 20% of registered voters in key “swing states,” or states where support for political parties is divided, consider digital assets an important issue in the 2024 election. 
The survey, conducted in partnership with The Harris Poll and encompassing Michigan, Ohio, Montana, Pennsylvania, Nevada, and Arizona, reveals that a pro-crypto stance can be “advantageous” for policymakers and candidates. It emphasizes the desire among voters for “reasonable regulations” that protect consumers without stifling innovation.

Julie Stitzel, Senior Vice President of Policy at DCG, highlighted the poll’s findings, stating that the digital asset industry is at the forefront of swing state voters’ minds and that a positive stance on virtual assets can benefit policymakers and candidates. 
Kristin Smith, CEO of the Blockchain Association, echoed this sentiment, emphasizing the growing relevance of digital assets in shaping the electoral landscape in 2024.

Bitcoin Runes Haven't Lived Up to the Hype? It's Still Too Early to Say - Decrypt

We do the research, you get the alpha!Get exclusive reports and access to key insights on airdrops, NFTs, and more! Subscribe now to Alpha Reports and up your game!Go to Alpha ReportsRunes, the new fungible token standard on Bitcoin, had enthusiasts buzzing when it launched in April amid the quadrennial Bitcoin halving event. But less than a month later, the early impact appears less monumental than many Bitcoin backers expected. The Runes launch indeed saw a flurry of immediate activity, with hundreds of token tickers launched within the halving block. But demand has decreased partially due to expectations, and amid a cooling crypto market that has seen broader price declines in recent weeks.Data from Sat Screener indicates that six of the top 10 most-traded Runes have experienced a decline in trading volume over the past seven days, ranging from 20% to 57%. In terms of the number of Runes etched, data from Dune shows that etching has dropped significantly since the start of May—from thousands per day in late April to just hundreds daily of late.On social media, chatter about Runes is divided. Many expected that the trading experience would be closer to trading well-established tokens like Ethereum’s ERC-20 standard, and not blocks of tokens pre-split by users. That’s made them feel more like they're trading NFTs rather than fungible tokens, with the early state of the tech creating another hurdle for early traders.But a small, yet vocal group of users continues to actively trade Runes amid the decline, even of some of them admit that there's a cooling of enthusiasm since the Bitcoin halving event. So, what's next for the future of Runes? Market observers have been quick to draw parallels between Runes and the NFT-like Ordinals—both created by Bitcoin developer Casey Rodarmor—highlighting a similar pattern of early hype followed by a gradual decline in activity.Others believe that Runes could follow a similar maturation arc. The earlier BRC-20 Bitcoin token standard similarly saw a flurry of initial excitement before a quieter period with less hype and demand, followed by a surge in value and trading activity. Runes were billed as a more “efficient” upgrade to BRC-20, however, so the initial trading hitches could also be dulling momentum in the short term.“Users coming to Bitcoin for the first time may have been underwhelmed that the experience is not dissimilar to BRC-20, and far from the advancement many have promoted on their timelines over the last few months,” FarmerJoe0x, the pseudonymous founder of Pups Token, told Decrypt. “That being said, several opportunities appear to be forming, such as bridges for Runes to Bitcoin layer-2 [networks], as well as Solana,” they added. “Demand for Bitcoin tokens is proving to be strong on centralized exchanges, and one can assume that when the tokens are accessible in the trading experience that most crypto users desire, we will see significant volumes—possibly on other chains—towards these tokens.”Yoonsup Choi, Senior Business Development Manager at Magic Eden, shared with Decrypt that while he's observed the decline, it was anticipated. Magic Eden has come out early as one of the most prominent Runes trading destinations, so he has a stake in their future. Choi remains confident that the fungible market on Bitcoin has significant upside potential.“The trading UI for runes will only get better, upgrades to the protocol can be made, and marketplaces such as Magic Eden are investing into bettering the UI/UX every day,” he said. “While the UI/UX might never catch up to SOL or EVM layer-2 meme coin trading, the transparency and immutable aspect of Runes can be another way Runes find [their] place.”Choi added that meme coin launches are often plagued by insider issues within the team, such as sniping, distributing to multiple wallets, and lack of clarity regarding the usage of funds. The Runes protocol addresses many of these concerns. “Runes offer complete transparency in their creation, including details on pre-mine percentages and minting criteria,” Choi explained.Despite this cooling-off period, Runes remain in their infancy, and supporters claim that it's far too early to count them out. The technology is still evolving, and as the community becomes more familiar with Runes features and the ecosystem matures, there's potential for renewed interest and growth.Besides, Runes transactions are still dominating Bitcoin of late, even if some of the hype has diminished. Previous Bitcoin innovations like Ordinals and BRC-20 tokens took a while to find broader trading interest and sizable demand, but both eventually secured substantial market fit. The crypto world is watching closely to see if (or when) that happens with Runes.Edited by Andrew HaywardStay on top of crypto news, get daily updates in your inbox.

SEC Chair Gary Gensler avoids direct classification of Ethereum - Crypto Briefing




Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) Chairman Gary Gensler did not directly address whether Ethereum was a commodity or a security in an interview with CNBC on Tuesday. Instead, he shifted the focus towards broader regulatory concerns, specifically the protection of American investors and the conduct of intermediaries in the crypto market.
“All I would say is, to me, the fundamental question is, is how do we ensure that the American investor is protected? And right now, they’re not getting the required or needed disclosures,” Gensler responded to an inquiry regarding Ethereum’s classification from Andrew Ross Sorkin on CNBC’s “Squawk Box” show.
“And the intermediaries in the center of this rather centralized market generally are conflicted and doing things we would never allow the New York Stock Exchange to do. The New York Stock Exchange is not allowed to trade against the investors,” Gensler stated.
Ethereum’s legal status is among the key areas of discussion since how Ether is classified could indicate how it could be regulated and whether it could be included in traded funds like ETFs. Unfortunately, Gensler did not provide a definitive answer.In his brief comment on spot Ethereum exchange-traded fund (ETF) potential, the SEC Chair said the filings are currently under consideration. He redirected the conversation from specific outcomes regarding the Ethereum ETF to the broader goals of the SEC.Despite the SEC’s stance on Ether remaining undisclosed, the agency’s alleged actions speak more than words.A number of reports show that the agency is attempting to classify Ether as a security. The investigation into the Ethereum Foundation is reportedly part of this.Recent court filings additionally pointed out that the SEC considered Ethereum unregistered security for at least a year. Numerous subpoenas and document requests have been sent to entities associated with Ethereum.The focus on crypto is driven by the mediaAccording to Gensler, crypto represents a small portion of the financial market. However, it draws widespread attention from journalists because it attracts a disproportionate share of scams, frauds, and regulatory issues.When asked why the SEC spent so much time on crypto despite its modest $110 market capitalization, Gensler said the focus on crypto is driven more by the media and public interest than the SEC’s agenda.
“I’ve been on your show, what, a dozen times? And every show, you ask about crypto. And my guessing is this will be a majority crypto interview. While the capital markets are $110 trillion. So it’s also about where the financial media is focused,” Gensler asserted.
Gensler added that many tokens are not compliant with the necessary protections required by these laws. This noncompliance results in a lack of proper disclosures and protections for investors.The SEC’s chief also avoided discussing the oversight of various market actors, including Robinhood, which recently received a Wells Notice from the SEC. He just said that investors need protection, and the SEC’s general role as a regulatory body is to ensure law compliance in securities trading.The SEC has faced backlash from crypto community members and lawmakers after threatening a legal lawsuit against Robinhood’s crypto arm. Crypto critics argue that the SEC should protect investors rather than stifle crypto innovation and that it has put an excessive amount of focus on the industry.

Ethereum devs propose new transaction type with EIP-7702 - Crypto Briefing




A group of prominent Ethereum developers, including Vitalik Buterin, has proposed a new transaction type (EIP-7702) to enhance the functionality and security of Externally Owned Accounts (EOAs). The proposal aims to address common issues such as transaction batching, sponsorship, and privilege de-escalation.According to the EIP-7702 draft, the new transaction type “adds a contract_code field and a signature, and converts the signing account (not necessarily the same as the tx.origin) into a smart contract wallet for the duration of that transaction.” The proposal is intended to offer similar functionality to EIP-3074.The motivation behind EIP-7702 is to provide short-term functionality improvements to EOAs, increasing the usability of applications and, in some cases, allowing for improved security. The proposal outlines three particular applications: batching, sponsorship, and privilege de-escalation.While EIP-3074 solves these use cases, the authors of EIP-7702 believe it has forward-compatibility concerns. They state that EIP-3074 “introduces two opcodes, AUTH and AUTHCALL, that would have no use in an ‘endgame account abstraction’ world where eventually all users are using smart contract wallets.”Additionally, they argue that EIP-3074 “leads to the development of an ‘invoker contract’ ecosystem that would be separate from the ‘smart contract wallet’ ecosystem, leading to possible fragmentation of effort.”The specification of EIP-7702 details the transaction payload format and the process of executing the transaction, which involves setting the contract code of the signing account temporarily and reverting it back to empty at the end of the transaction.The authors provide a rationale for how EIP-7702 can convert EIP-3074 use cases, stating that “it requires fairly little work to convert an existing EIP-3074 workflow.”They also argue that EIP-7702 is designed to be forward-compatible with future account abstraction, avoiding the creation of separate code ecosystems and the need for new opcodes that may become obsolete.Despite the potential benefits, the authors acknowledge that EIP-7702 breaks the invariant that an account balance can only decrease as a result of transactions originating from that account, which may have consequences for mempool design and other EIPs.As with any proposal requiring users to sign contract code, the authors emphasize the importance of user wallets being cautious about which contract_code they sign, highlighting the shared security considerations with EIP-3074.

The $BONSAI Opp | Bankless


One thing I look out for lately is where NFTs intersect with memecoins and crypto social scenes.For example, minting NFTs with $DEGEN in the /degen channel of Farcaster's leading app, Warpcast, or $ENJOY being distributed in comments on Zora mints, and so forth. That said, Lens is another crypto social protocol in the same general ballpark as Farcaster, and it has its own rising scene of apps, like Hey, Orb, T2, and Yup. A common denominator among these Lens apps right now? Their communities' memecoin of choice is currently $BONSAI.$BONSAI is an ERC-20 and ERC-721 hybrid (100k $BONSAI = 1 BONSAI NFT) on Polygon built by Carlos Beltran of MadFi per the DN-404 approach. Its first airdrop wave went out to active Lens users in March 2024, with further waves planned over the coming months. Since this launch, $BONSAI has rapidly become a centerpiece in demonstrating the Lens protocol's programmable potential. For instance, Lens handles profiles as NFTs, and through these users can interact on Lens apps with Open Actions—think programmable interactions, like collecting posts, minting NFTs, or tipping, all directly in-feed. As such, $BONSAI can be used to pay for any Open Action on any Lens app, and in fact, it has become the most popular form of payments in the Lens ecosystem to date, opening a new monetization avenue for creators adventuring through the crypto social scene right now. Just from scanning around, I've seen $BONSAI used to make in-app purchases for everything ranging from 1/1 music NFTs to an actual IRL car.It makes sense to dabble here right now if you're interested, as this Dune dashboard by Sealaunch shows that creators who have tried monetizing at least once have earned +$200 on average over the past 30 days and are on pace for +$2.6k annually. Not bad!If you're not sure where to start, my former colleague María Paula recently wrote an excellent guide, Learning How to Monetize Sustainably, that walks through how to smartly approach releasing your content for $BONSAI on the Orb Social app. She recommends...via María PaulaI don't think you approach $BONSAI as a pure investment here. It's not a basic buy and hold per se, but rather it's an inway to the Lens social scene and a monetization avenue, e.g. via dropping content like NFTs for $BONSAI, distributions from Lens apps like Orb, and future airdrop waves. That said, though, the current market cap of $BONSAI is only $6M compared to the $244M of $DEGEN, which makes the latter more than 40x bigger right now. Yet is $DEGEN 40x more interesting, fundamentally speaking?If $BONSAI can even reach half the market cap that $DEGEN enjoys today, then its current $0.02 price will 20x to $0.4. And with the Lens culture scene on the rise and with apps like Hey and Orb catching steam, I don't think gaining ground like this is out of the realm of possibility. Of course, with any memecoin, there's high risk / high reward potential. Their values can surge and sink in short order, 'round and 'round, or fade away. However, most memecoins aren't buoyed by multiple active and passionate user bases, and that's why I think $BONSAI has favorable tailwinds, particularly for the foreseeable future.

550 Million Crypto Airdrop Launches on Optimism (OP)


Mode Network, a modular decentralized finance (DeFi) Layer-2 solution built on the Optimism Stack, has launched its governance token, MODE. 
Simultaneously, the network has initiated its crypto airdrop season, with the token claim site now active for participants.
550 Million Crypto Airdrop
The MODE token has dual functions. It serves as a governance mechanism and promotes ecological growth within the network. The total supply of MODE tokens is fixed at 10 billion, with an initial circulation of 1.3 billion tokens. This comes from previous crypto airdrops and the foundation and treasury allocations.
Regarding distribution, 35% of MODE tokens are allocated for crypto airdrops to users and developers. And 5.5% of those will be released in the first quarter. 

Additionally, 19% of the tokens go to investors and early contributors, subject to a 12-month lock-up followed by a 24-month linear release. The foundation and treasury hold 27% of the tokens to fund ecosystem incentives through governance mechanisms.
To mitigate early sell-offs, top contributors will undergo initial claim restrictions, allowing them to claim 50% of their tokens immediately and the remaining 50% after 90 days, provided they maintain their assets within the network.

Grayscale withdraws its Ethereum Futures ETF application

Grayscale has made a surprising move to withdraw its 19b-4 application for its Ether (ETH) futures exchange-traded fund, just three weeks before the securities regulator would be forced to make a decision on it.The cryptocurrency asset manager filed a notice of withdraw the Grayscale Ethereum Futures Trust with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission on May 7.The SEC was scheduled to make a final decision on Grayscale's Ether futures ETF on May 30.Grayscale initially filed its 19b-4 application for its Ether futures ETF on Sept. 19, 2023, which would have been listed on the New York Stock Exchange, had it been approved.Bloomberg ETF analyst James Seyffart initially believed that Grayscale planned to strategically use its Ether futures ETF as a “trojan horse” to corner the SEC into approving its spot Ether ETF.But he expressed confusion as to why Grayscale would withdraw now, when the SEC will be forced to make a decision to approve or deny several at least one spot Ether ETF application on May 23, a little over two weeks away.Related: SEC will classify Ether as security, deny spot Ether ETFs — Michael SaylorFor several months, Seyffart and fellow Bloomberg ETF analyst Eric Balchunas have held a 25% chance the spot Ether ETFs will be approved on May 23, down from 70% in January. However, comments from SEC Chair Gary Gensler in a May 7 interview with CNBC suggest the SEC is still weighing up its decision on the spot Ether ETFs.“That’s something in front of our Commission right now, we’re a five-member Commission, and those filings will take up at the appropriate time.”The SEC must make its decision on the VanEck's application on May 23, while ARK 21Shares and Hashdex have final deadlines on May 24 and May 30.Deadlines for the spot Ether ETF applications before the SEC. Source: James SeyffartApplications from Grayscale, Invesco Galaxy, BlackRock and Fidelity must be made in June, July and August. However many industry pundits expect the securities regulator to make a decision on all or most applicants in the same way it did with the spot Bitcoin ETFs in January.Magazine: The real risks to Ethena’s stablecoin model (are not the ones you think)

‘Last Dip Ever’ - Analyst Predicts Solana Rally, Says Three Memecoins Will Surge Alongside SOL - The Daily Hodl


								A closely followed crypto trader believes that Solana (SOL) just witnessed its last major correction for this market cycle.
Pseudonymous analyst Inmortal tells his 213,300 followers on the social media platform X that SOL bulls successfully defended support at around $120.










The trader shares a chart suggesting that the blue-chip altcoin is now poised to rally to a fresh 2024 high at $320.
“Last dip ever.
SOL.” 
Source: Inmortal/X
At time of writing, SOL is worth $153.45, suggesting an upside potential of nearly 110% if the altcoin hits the analyst’s target.
Inmortal also predicts that a trio of memecoins will rally alongside Solana. The trader is taking a close watch on Floki (FLOKI), which he says looks bullish after retesting the 200 moving average (MA) on the eight-hour chart and reclaiming support at $0.00015.
Inmortal believes that FLOKI will dip to around $0.00017 before surging to $0.00025 later this month.
“IF SOL goes up, THEN FLOKI, DOGE, PEPE go up too.
Especially interested in FLOKI
> Deviation + Retest + 200 MA
> A bit lagged.” 
Source: Inmortal/X
At time of writing, FLOKI is trading at $0.000179.
Another coin on the trader’s radar is Seedify.Fund (SFUND), an incubator and launchpad specializing in blockchain gaming. According to the analyst, SFUND is currently in the process of cementing the $2.60 level as support.
“Retesting a 578 days accumulation, for the second time.
Definitely, you don’t see this every day.
SFUND.” 
Source: Inmortal/X
Looking at the trader’s chart, he seems to predict that SFUND will rally to $6 in the coming months. At time of writing, SFUND is trading at $2.65.

Shiba Inu Whale Moves 1.7 Trillion SHIB As Price Struggles, Where Are They Headed? | Bitcoinist.com


								The crypto community’s attention has been drawn to a Shiba Inu whale that recently moved trillions of the meme coin. Given the magnitude of these transactions, community members have sought to discover where these tokens were transferred and the motive behind them.
Shiba Inu Whale Moves 1.7 Trillion SHIB
On-chain data shows that the whale (crypto trading platform Robinhood) moved 1.7 trillion SHIB tokens from one of its wallets to another in two separate transactions, with 875 billion SHIB tokens moved in the first transaction and the same amount transferred in the second. 

The crypto platform has become known for moving enormous amounts of SHIB tokens between their wallets, possibly to meet demand from customers. Bitcoinist recently reported how the trading platform moved 3 trillion Shiba Inu tokens in one transaction. Robinhood also had at one point accumulated 332 billion SHIB at a go. 
Robinhood’s most recent transaction follows the platform’s recent listing of the meme coin for its New York customers. As such, these whale transactions could have been made to fulfill buy orders from these customers. Whale transactions like Robinhood’s signal a bullish outlook for the meme coin and could spark price surges for the meme coin. 
Besides the whales, other Shiba Inu investors look to be actively accumulating the meme coin with data from the on-chain analytics platform IntoTheBlock, which shows that the bid-ask volume imbalance is bullish for the meme coin. Another bullish signal for the meme coin is the increase in token burns. Data from the burn tracking website Shibburn shows that the token burns have increased by almost 30% in the last seven days. 
Shiba Inu Lead Developer Teases New Project
Shiba Inu’s lead developer, Shytoshi Kusama, recently shared a cryptic GIF on his X (formerly Twitter) platform with the word “Evita,” which means “life” in Latin. Another Shiba Inu developer, Kaal Dhairya, also shared a GIF on his X platform that had the word “Evita” on it, suggesting that the team might be working on another project in the Shiba Inu ecosystem. 

Members of the Shiba Inu community have already begun trying to decode what these cryptic tweets could mean, but nothing has been made out of them so far, with only mere speculations. However, this is undoubtedly something to keep an eye on, considering that Kusama has in the past made cryptic posts that usually serve as a prelude to a big announcement.  
At the time of writing, Shiba Inu is trading at around $0.00002391, down over 3% in the last 24 hours, according to data from CoinMarketCap.

Fantom (FTM) Bull Run: 8% Price Surge And Robust Double-Digit Growth In Key Metrics


                            Fantom (FTM), a Layer-1 (L1) protocol, and its native token, FTM, have experienced significant gains and notable achievements in the first quarter (Q1) of 2024. 
According to a comprehensive performance analysis conducted by Messari, amid the emerging crypto bull market, Fantom has emerged as one of the major beneficiaries, showing significant growth in key metrics and market capitalization. 
FTM Market Cap Soars 101% QoQ
By the numbers, FTM’s circulating market capitalization saw a substantial 101% quarter-over-quarter (QoQ) increase, jumping from $1.3 billion to $2.6 billion, vaulting it up ten spots to 48th among all tokens (currently 58th). The token’s rally extended for two consecutive quarters, resulting in a fourfold increase since the end of Q3 2023.

Although Fantom experienced a decrease of 53% QoQ in revenue measured in FTM, amounting to 1.8 million FTM, revenue denominated in USD exhibited a 4% QoQ increase, reaching $1.2 million. 
According to Messari, the revenue decline was primarily due to reduced inscription activity across all smart contract platforms in Q1. 
Despite this, Fantom maintained an upward trend in average daily transactions, excluding inscription-related activity, surpassing the Q3 average and reaching 247,000 daily transactions. Daily active addresses also rebounded, rising by 24% QoQ to 40,500.
In Q1, the staking requirement for Fantom validators was significantly reduced from 500,000 FTM to 50,000 FTM, aiming to increase accessibility. However, the number of active validators remained unchanged at 55. 
Notably, the total amount of FTM staked increased by 17% QoQ, from 1.1 billion to 1.3 billion FTM, resulting in a 135% QoQ surge in the total dollar value of staked FTM, reaching $1.2 billion. Among proof-of-stake (PoS) networks, Fantom ranked 22nd in the dollar value of funds staked by the end of Q1.
Memecoin Mania Boosts Fantom On-Chain Activity
During the year’s first quarter, Total Value Locked (TVL) denominated in USD experienced a substantial 59% QoQ increase, rising from $810.8 million in Q4 to $1.28 billion. 
Conversely, TVL-denominated in FTM decreased by 21% QoQ, indicating that the surge in USD-denominated TVL was partly attributed to FTM’s price appreciation.
Fantom’s average daily decentralized exchange (DEX) volume surged by 64% QoQ, from $10.2 million to nearly $176.8 million. In Q1, the “Memecoin Mania” trend contributed to elevated on-chain activity across various networks, including Fantom.

Fantom’s monthly DEX volume surpassed $1 billion in March, marking the first time since March 2023. The number of DEXs on Fantom increased to 31 by the end of Q1, with no single DEX dominating more than 30% of the market share.

Lastly, following an exploit in the Multichain: Fantom Bridge, which affected stablecoins on Fantom in Q3 2023, the Fantom Foundation took steps to increase the liquidity of stablecoins. 
As of Q1 2024, two independent third-party bridging solutions, Axelar (axlUSDC and axlUSDT) and LayerZero (lzUSDC and lzUSDT), have emerged. USDC remains the predominant stablecoin on Fantom, accounting for 98% of the stablecoin market cap. USDT also experienced considerable growth, with an 86% QoQ increase.

The FTM token is currently trading at $0.7037, reflecting an 8.7% increase in price over the past seven days. However, it has experienced a decline of nearly 20% in the monthly time frame.

                        Gary Gensler, Chair of the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), defended the agency’s attention to the crypto industry in an interview on May 7, asserting that it’s not an undue focus but rather a response to the prevalence of scams and frauds within the sector. Speaking with CNBC, Gensler emphasized that while crypto represents a small portion of the financial markets, it disproportionally contributes to issues such as scams and frauds, attracting significant media attention.Gary Gensler’s Big Concern
Gensler pointed out that the financial press amplifies coverage of crypto-related matters compared to traditional securities markets, leading to a heightened perception of the industry’s importance. “We oversee a $110 trillion capital market. Crypto is a small piece of our overall markets, but it’s an outsized piece of the scams, frauds and problems in our markets,” Gensler said..He noted that the volume of questions from journalists regarding crypto relative to its market capitalization reflects this heightened attention from the media.The SEC’s enforcement actions in the crypto space have increased, with 46 crypto-related enforcement actions initiated last year, marking a surge from previous years.”You end up with an outsized ration of journalists questions…to market cap; it’s also a function of where the financial media is focused,” he said.According to analyses by Cornerstone Research and the law firm Gibson Dunn, however, these actions are a fraction of the total enforcement actions conducted by the SEC, which amounted to 501 last year.Gary Gensler Has Always Been After Transparency
SEC Chair Gary Gensler stressed the necessity of transparency in crypto markets, advocating for mandatory disclosure to combat some industry participants’ evasion of registration requirements. He cited Supreme Court Justice Louis Brandeis’ famous quote, “Sunlight is said to be the best of disinfectants,” to emphasize the importance of transparency.Gensler’s remarks come amid the SEC’s intensified efforts to regulate the crypto industry, evidenced by multiple lawsuits filed against prominent crypto firms and figures like Sam Bankman-Fried, Binance, its CEO Changpeng Zhao, and Coinbase. These actions reflect Gensler’s stance that most cryptocurrencies should be classified as securities, aligning with the SEC’s regulatory approach.While the SEC’s scrutiny has sparked calls for more explicit regulatory guidelines to foster innovation within the U.S., the agency continues its campaign to potentially classify Ethereum as a security, issuing subpoenas as part of this effort. Gensler emphasized the importance of registration requirements to ensure mandatory disclosure, characterizing it as essential for maintaining market integrity.

FTX plans full pay back of all creditors ‘plus billions in compensation’

FTX wants to give 98% of its creditors up to 118% of their allowed claims, while the rest will get fully repaid plus “billions in compensation for the time value of their investments.”In a May 7 statement, the bankrupt crypto exchange said the plan was "subject to being finalized and approved” by a Delaware Bankruptcy Court.“We are pleased to be in a position to propose a Chapter 11 plan that contemplates the return of 100% of bankruptcy claim amounts plus interest for non-governmental creditors,” said FTX CEO and chief restructuring officer John J. Ray III. It’s a reversal from FTX’s former plan which saw creditors reimbursed for the value of their assets at the time of its bankruptcy in November 2022.Since then, the crypto markets have seen a resurgence, with Bitcoin (BTC) rising by over 200%. FTX estimated the total value of property collected, converted into cash to be distributed to creditors will range between $14.5 and $16.3 billion.Figures from FTX's amended reimbursement plan. Source: FTXOnly creditors holding claims in an allowed amount below $50,000 will be eligible for the 118% recovery, should it be approved by the bankruptcy court.The proposed repayment would occur within 60 days after the effective date of the plan.Related: Bankruptcy judge signs off on $450M FTX-Voyager settlementThe $32 billion cryptocurrency exchange collapsed in November 2022, revealing a $8 billion hole that its new management has been trying to recover in the years following.Among those efforts include a $884 million sale of shares in artificial intelligence firm Anthropic in March, which accounted for a majority of FTX's stake in the firm.FTX confirmed in January that its restructuring plans will not include a reboot of the cryptocurrency exchange, which was among the largest platforms by trading volume prior to it collapsing.

                        Worldcoin officials want to smooth out their “differences” with Argentina regulators, with Tools for Humanity CEO Alex Blania visiting President Javier Milei’s advisors this week.Per a report from Infobae (via La Nueva Radio Suarez), Blania has recently met with several government officials.The media outlet explained that the Tools for Humanity chief met with Demian Reidel, a member of Milei’s Council of Advisors.Worldcoin Argentina Plans Hit Hurdle?
Worldcoin has enjoyed considerable popularity in Argentina, where it reportedly operates over 50 iris-scanning centers.The media outlet Criptonoticias reported that “it is estimated that 3 million people” have “handed over their data” in exchange for WLD tokens.The project’s popularity in Argentina dwarfs that of any other nation in the Latin American region, despite a rise in Mexican and Chilean users.However, Tools for Humanity has had to contend with an almost constant slew of pushback from the Argentinian authorities.In 2023, the nation’s data protection agency, the Agency for Access to Public Information (AAIP), launched a probe.It also summoned company officials, demanding that they show the operator is taking steps to avoid possible violations of the nation’s Personal Data Protection Law.The AAIP has also asked for written explanations, demanding to know what types of data it processes “and for what purposes.”‘Data Concerns’ Worry Regulators
As is the case in other nations, Argentina controls the amount of time companies are allowed to retain citizens’ data.The agency also wants Worldcoin officials to provide information about the safety of the devices they use to perform facial and iris scanning.The government agency has also concluded that Worldcoin “does not have a legal presence” or “formal offices” in the country.The firm has faced further issues in the province of Buenos Aires. Local ministry officials in the province have begun their own investigations.Two lawmakers in the province’s legislative body have also called for authorities to step in.WLD prices over the past seven days. (Source: CoinMarketCap)One called for the Buenos Aires Governor to take action. And another has launched a draft bill that, if passed would regulate Worldcoin and other projects like it in Buenos Aires.The Provincial Directorate for the Defense of Consumer Rights has also investigated alleged Worldcoin “contracts” that could “violate the National Consumer Defense Law.”Argentina Ban Still Unlikely?
However, while scrutiny and controversy continue, talk of an outright, Kenya-style suspension of Worldcoin operations is yet to gather pace in Argentina.Blania, who reportedly met with various “figures from different sectors in the government sphere,” will doubtlessly hope his visit will put an end to such talk. The firm was quoted as saying:“Worldcoin complies with the highest global standards governing the processing of personal data.”

Solana Price Prediction as Traders Predict 40% Surge Soon

                        The Solana (SOL) price is pulling lower on Tuesday, dipping back to $150 having pushed nearly as high as $160 earlier in the day, though traders continue to predict big near-term upside for the token.Solana succumbed to sell pressure on Tuesday after challenging the $160-163 support-turned-resistance zone, where the 50DMA also resides.For now, the Solana price remains locked within a $120-160 range. Source: TradingViewSOL is still up more than 25% versus last week’s lows. Last week’s weaker-than-expected US jobs data helped boost sentiment on rising confidence for Fed rate cuts this year.Spot Bitcoin ETF flows have also been positive in recent days, though US regulatory fears are in focus this week. The SEC this week hit retail stock and crypto trading platform Robinhood with a Wells Notice.For now, the Solana price remains locked within a $120-160 range.But traders continue to predict big things for the cryptocurrency. Here’s what you need to know.Solana Price Prediction – Traders Predict a 40% Surge
One trader thinks the Solana price is set up to post a near-term 40% surge.In their post on TradingView, ATradeSniper thinks SOL can pump back above $200 after breaking out of a descending flag structure.Other traders are also bullish on the near-term outlook.“SOL is the most bullish chart after BTC right now,” commented popular crypto analysis account MancBTC.Solana has held its yearly volume weighted average price (VWAP), with its ecosystem and memes booming, Mac noted.MacnBTC also thinks the Solana price is ready to move 40% up and surpass $200 once again.Meanwhile, fellow analyst ColdBloodShill urged followers to ignore low time frame (LTF) analysis, and focus on strength in the HTFs.With bullishness expected to return to crypto later this year as post-halving tailwinds come in for BTC and Fed rate cuts arrive, the Solana price could be in consolidation mode ahead of a major push higher.Investors would do well to secure a decent bag of SOL. But they should also add exposure to crypto tokens within the Solana ecosystem.These might include leading Solana meme coins BONK or WIF. Or the native token of Solana’s largest DEX Jupiter (JUP).But traders looking to take on some risk would also do well to allocate to up-and-coming projects.One project that analysts at Cryptonews like a lot is new Solana meme coin Slothana (SLOTH).SOL Alternative to Consider – Slothana (SLOTH)
After a blockbuster presale that saw Slothana rake in more than $10 million in funds, the meme coins launch last week was a big success.The token last had a market cap of $14 million, with over $2 million in liquidity and over 35,000 holders.That’s according to DEXTools, whose smart contract audit shows Slothana to be a squeaky-clean token.Those impressive metrics suggest Slothana has the early makings of a meme coin that could deliver big gains.The first goal would be to overtake Slerf, the current largest Sloth-themed token on Solana.Slerf hit a market cap high of near $500 million earlier this year. If SLOTH can match this feat, that would mean 35x gains from current levels.But SLOTH has even bigger goals than this, and that’s why the team continues to build out the coin’s utility.“Exciting updates are brewing in the background,” Slothana teased on Twitter.
