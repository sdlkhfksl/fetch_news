Binance Coin (BNB) Price Prediction: $1,000 in Sight as Exchange Thrives


							

Binance Coin (BNB) gains momentum with the launch of the Binance World Championship promotion, driving increased trading activity and investor interest.



Binance’s ecosystem, featuring initiatives like Binance Smart Chain, Launchpad, and Launchpool, bolsters BNB’s resilience and demand.



Despite challenges like BSC’s modest volume growth, BNB’s utility within Binance’s ecosystem and deflationary model position it for sustained value appreciation.




Sheldon The Sniper, a crypto enthusiast, predicts a bullish trajectory for Binance Coin (BNB), suggesting it reaches the $1000 mark after exceeding its all-time highs. As the coin gains momentum, recent developments shed light on factors driving its surge.







Sheldon’s anticipation aligns with BNB’s current performance, trading at $703.55 with a 24-hour trading volume of $2.68 billion. Moreover, Binance’s latest initiative, the Binance World Championship, offers traders a chance to win 1 BNB by trading $100 across Convert, Spot, and Futures platforms. The promotion, running until June 30, 2024, aims to engage users and drive activity.



Furthermore, CryptoCondom analyzes the dynamics driving BNB’s ascent. Notably, Binance has witnessed significant inflows this year, amounting to $8.4 billion since January 1, 2024, according to data from DefiLlama. This influx coincides with renewed investor confidence following regulatory compliance measures and Binance CEO Changpeng Zhao’s (CZ) reduced public presence due to legal issues.







Moreover, Binance’s ecosystem showcases resilience, with steady Binance Smart Chain (BSC) volume and strategic mechanisms like quarterly Buy and Burn contributing to its deflationary model. Additionally, the Binance Launchpad and Launchpool facilitate token launches, creating a supply squeeze as tokens are staked, amplifying demand for BNB.









However, while Binance’s ecosystem remains robust, BSC’s volume has yet to grow significantly this year. Nonetheless, initiatives like the Launchpad and Launchpool underscore Binance’s ability to capitalize on emerging trends and projects, further buoying BNB’s value.



BNB’s upward trajectory is evidenced by its utility within the Binance ecosystem, where it serves as a primary token for transactions, fees, and staking. As Binance continues to innovate and expand its offerings, BNB’s demand will likely soar, consolidating its position as a leading cryptocurrency. This could potentially lead to BNB surpassing Sheldon’s $1000 target.

BNB price soars to new all-time high; market cap exceeds $100 billion - CoinJournal



                    

                    
BNB price hit a new all-time high of $716 on Wednesday.
The Binance Coin’s market cap surpassed $100 billion, with trading volume reaching $3.5 billion.

BNB, the native token of the Binance ecosystem, has skyrocketed to a new all-time high, with its marlet cap rising to over $100 billion.
BNB surges 17% to new all-time high as Bitcoin hits $71,000
On June 5, BNB price increased by more than 17% to hit its highest ever level.  
The gains came amid an overall upside flip for Bitcoin, which rose past the $71,000 mark for the first time since May 21.
As BTC extended recent recovery to above the psychological level, BNB bulls tore past the previous ATH to hit $716 on crypto exchanges.
Having traded at lows of $592 on June 1, 2024, the Binance coin has outshone other top 10 coins by market cap. BNB’s market cap hit $110 billion as the price soared, pushing the cryptocurrency into 4th spot overall behind USDT, Ethereum and Bitcoin. The 24-hour trading volume reached $3.5 billion.
BNB price outlook
BNB’s upward momentum comes as the Binance exchange sees continued resurgence in community sentiment. The platform’s Launchpool is a top offering that has helped BNB holders grab new gems such as the hot Notcoin (NOT) token.
While BNB is trading around $706 at the time of writing, there’s likelihood bulls may target further gains above the $700 level. This outlook will strengthen if buyers push above the initial rejection area around $716. 
A break to $750 could encourage bulls, a scenario that has crypto analysts bullish on BNB price. 
The weekly chart on TradingView shows BNB price has jumped 17% in the past three days.

Meanwhile, BNB’s daily chart shows the breakout from the ascending triangle has the RSI in the overbought zone. However, it’s not overextended and the MACD indicator has a bullish bias to suggest buy side pressure remains.
According to Coinglass data, the BNB open interest currently stands at $1.1 billion, with a 24-hour change of +39%.

This Popular Meme Coin Flips Monero (XMR) and Cronos (CRO) Following a New ATH: Details


																TL;DR

The cryptocurrency market surged on June 5, with Bitcoin (BTC) exceeding $71,000.
The meme coin sector is also well in the green, with one asset of that type tapping a new all-time high.


The Token’s Latest Surge
The cryptocurrency market is flashing green today (June 5), with numerous leading digital assets charting substantial increases. Bitcoin (BTC) surpassed the $71,000 mark for the first time in two weeks, while Binance Coin (BNB) hit a new all-time high of over $715.
The meme coin sector has been thriving, too. The biggest tokens of that type in terms of market capitalization – Dogecoin (DOGE) and Shiba Inu (SHIB) – are up 4% and 8%, respectively, while Bonk Inu (BONK) jumped by 10% on a daily scale.
One meme coin that outperformed the aforementioned is the dog-themed Floki Inu (FLOKI). It witnessed a 30% price surge to hit a fresh all-time high of approximately $0.0003394 (per CoinGecko’s data).
FLOKI Price, Source: CoinGecko
FLOKI’s market capitalization exceeded the $3.2 billion mark for the first time ever, thus flipping popular altcoins such as Cronos (CRO), Monero (XMR), Arbitrum (ARB), and more. The meme coin is currently the 40th-biggest cryptocurrency and the fifth-largest in its cohort. The fourth place belongs to the Solana-based dogwifhat (WIF), whose market cap is around $3.5 billion. 




One person who noted FLOKI’s latest success is the popular X user KALEO. The analyst assumed that the token’s market capitalization could “easily” skyrocket to $10 billion during the next bull cycle.
The Possible Contributing Factors
The overall bullish condition of the cryptocurrency market is not the only element that has potentially propelled FLOKI’s recent rally. Another essential factor could be the decision of the Floki DAO (the decentralized autonomous organization that governs the meme coin) to destroy over 15 billion assets. The vote was passed with an overwhelming majority of 99.84%.
Removing a substantial amount from the asset’s circulating supply makes it scarcer and more valuable in time (assuming demand stays the same or rises). 
Last but not least, the price resurgence might be linked to DWF LABS’ purchase of 12 million FLOKI tokens to support the meme coin’s ecosystem.
The Web3 investment firm initially disclosed its partnership with the meme coin in May last year when it purchased $5 million of the cryptocurrency. Earlier this year, it doubled down on the collaboration by acquiring $10 million worth of FLOKI tokens.

Bitwise: US Political Shift Could Propel Crypto Market to New Highs


In recent weeks, the US political environment has shown signs of shifting its stance towards the crypto industry. Bitwise’s Chief Investment Officer (CIO), Matt Hougan, believes this evolving attitude could bring the crypto market to new all-time highs.
Despite the lack of widespread attention outside the crypto community, this political shift may present a significant opportunity, or “alpha,” for investors. Alpha is a term in the crypto market that refers to information that has the potential to give a trader an edge and outperform the market.
Bitwise: Regulatory Clarity Could Bring Crypto to $20 Trillion Markets

Hougan remarks that a shift started on May 8, when the House voted for H.J. Res. 109, repealing Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 121 (SAB 121). SAB 121 is the US Security and Exchange Commission (SEC) rule that prevents large banks from custodying crypto assets.
This bipartisan support extended to the Senate. Although President Joe Biden vetoed the bill, this passage marked the first positive legislative action for crypto in US history.
Read more: Crypto Regulation: What Are the Benefits and Drawbacks?
On May 20, the House voted for the Financial Innovation and Technology for the 21st Century Act (FIT21) bill. This comprehensive crypto legislation grants primary oversight to the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC). However, both SEC Chair Gary Gensler and President Joe Biden expressed their opposition to the FIT21 bill.

This momentum continued with the SEC approving filings for spot Ethereum (ETH) exchange-traded funds (ETFs). The decision is surprising, given Gensler’s stance toward the FIT21 bill. The approval, however, came with the condition of removing staking aspects.
Hougan sees the overall positive shift in Washington’s attitude holds significant potential for growth. He thinks regulatory uncertainty has been a major barrier for financial advisors managing an estimated $20 trillion in wealth. According to Bitwise, 64% of advisors cited this uncertainty as the primary reason for limited crypto exposure in their portfolios.

“Imagine, then, how much of that $20 trillion will go into crypto when the biggest barrier gets lifted,” Hougan outlined.

Furthermore, Hougan uses major Wall Street banks, such as The Bank of New York, Nasdaq, and State Street Bank, as examples. He notes that these banks have been hesitant or slow to enter the crypto space due to regulatory concerns. However, with regulatory clarity, they could now fully embrace crypto, which would significantly boost the market.
Crypto is a Bipartisan Issue
Experts believe the upcoming election heavily influences the Biden administration’s changing stance towards the crypto industry. BeInCrypto reported that several key industry figures have urged the community to support pro-crypto candidates.
Major entities, including Ripple and Coinbase, have shown their support by donating significantly to Fairshake, a digital assets-friendly Super Political Action Committee (PAC). With such movements increasing, the crypto community has a unique opportunity to influence the political environment.

Moreover, former President Donald Trump, who is also running in the presidential election, has strategically targeted crypto-focused campaigns. Trump expressed his comfort with crypto and accepted donations in cryptocurrencies.
He also pledged a more welcoming approach to the industry, criticizing current US regulatory measures as hostile. Ultimately, he urged those who favor crypto to vote for him.
Despite the gap between the two major candidates, Grayscale’s report shows that crypto is a bipartisan issue, with similar ownership rates among Republicans (18%) and Democrats (19%). Voters are split on which party is more favorable to the industry.

Crypto Exchange Plans $321 Million Fundraise After Hack


Japanese crypto exchange DMM Bitcoin has announced a 50 billion yen ($321 million) fundraising plan. The funds will be used to purchase Bitcoin to compensate customers affected by the recent hack. 
DMM Bitcoin operates under the umbrella of DMM.com, an enterprise active in several sectors, including entertainment, technology, and renewable energy. It is led by CEO Keishi Kameyama.
Japanese Regulators Demand Investigation Into DMM Bitcoin Hack

On Wednesday, DMM Bitcoin shared details of its fundraising strategy. The company aims to raise funds from its group companies through a 48 billion yen (~ $ $307.8 million) capital increase and 2 billion yen (~ $ $12.8 million) in subordinated debt. 
This financial maneuver is designed to minimize any potential impact on the Bitcoin (BTC) market while acquiring crypto assets.

“It’s difficult for outsiders to pass judgment on the exchange’s plan to raise funds since it involves other companies that also belong to the broader DMM.com Group,” Yuya Hasegawa said.

The unauthorized outflow involved 4,502.9 Bitcoin. Based on the current market price of nearly $71,000, this incident is the seventh-largest crypto theft recorded, according to blockchain analytics firm Chainalysis. This loss highlights persistent security vulnerabilities within digital asset exchanges and intensifies concerns over their security frameworks.
Reacting swiftly, Japan’s Financial Services Agency has called for an in-depth examination into the origins of the breach and the strategy for compensating affected customers. Finance Minister Shunichi Suzuki has also underscored the government’s dedication to bolstering security measures to thwart future incidents.
This breach is not an isolated incident in Japan’s crypto industry but part of a larger pattern of significant hacks, with earlier episodes including the Mt. Gox collapse in 2014 and the CoinCheck breach in 2018. In an interview with BeInCrypto, Mati Greenspan, CEO of Quantum Economics, reflected on the recurring security issues in the Japanese crypto sector.


“The first was Mt. Gox in 2014 and then CoinCheck in 2018. You’d think by now people would learn not to leave their crypto on these centralized exchanges. Both of the previous hacks effectively halted crypto adoption in Japan for quite a while. I suspect this time will be no different as people often learn the wrong lesson from these type of things,” Greenspan told BeInCrypto.

Despite the grim circumstances, the overall crypto sector shows signs of resilience and adjustment. Data from 2024 reveals a 20% decrease in losses due to crypto-related crimes compared to the previous year.

Specifically, May 2024 saw a 12% decline in such incidents compared to May 2023.

On-Chain Analyst: ‘DOGE Accumulation Looking Stronger Than Anything Right Now’ | Cryptoglobe


                                
On 5 June 2024, crypto analyst Cole Garner posted a provocative prediction on the social media platform X (formerly known as Twitter). 







Cole Garner is a well-known figure in the cryptocurrency space, recognized for his expertise as an on-chain analyst and market cyclist. His work primarily focuses on analyzing Bitcoin market trends and predicting price movements using various metrics and indicators. Garner frequently shares his insights on social media platforms, particularly X, where he provides detailed analysis on Bitcoin’s market dynamics. One of his notable contributions is the analysis of whale accumulation trends, which he believes are crucial for a bull market. He emphasizes that whale behavior, where large-volume investors hold or accumulate BTC, often precedes significant price surges



Let’s break down each element of Garner’s post and its implications for Dogecoin (DOGE) and the broader cryptocurrency market.



Musk’s acquisition of Twitter (now rebranded as X) was a complex and highly publicized process. Musk first disclosed his 9.2% stake in Twitter on 4 April 2022, making him the largest shareholder. Following some initial drama, including an offer to join Twitter’s board and subsequent refusal, Musk made a formal offer to buy the company on 14 April 2022 for $44 billion, or $54.20 per share. This offer was initially met with skepticism and resulted in a “poison pill” strategy by Twitter’s board to prevent a hostile takeover​​​​.



After months of negotiations, public disputes over spam accounts, and legal battles, Musk completed the acquisition on 27 October 2022. Upon completion, he immediately made significant changes, including firing key executives such as CEO Parag Agrawal and CFO Ned Segal​​.



The acquisition was part of Musk’s broader vision to transform Twitter into an “everything app” called X, similar to China’s WeChat, where users can handle a wide range of activities including payments. This strategic direction has led to speculation about integrating cryptocurrencies, particularly Dogecoin (DOGE), as a payment method on the platform​.



Musk has been a vocal supporter of Dogecoin for several years. 















            
            

            
            

            
            

        

His tweets and public statements have often led to significant price movements in the cryptocurrency market. 







As CoinDesk reported in January 2024, X has introduced a dedicated account for its forthcoming payments feature, sparking speculation within the cryptocurrency community about potential integration of digital currencies. The X app is expected to launch its in-app payment services by mid-2024, generating significant anticipation.



Source: X



Meanwhile, Elon Musk has enabled Dogecoin as a payment option in Tesla’s merchandise store and frequently references it on social media. This has led many to speculate that Dogecoin could be the first cryptocurrency integrated into X if any digital currency is adopted.



The possibility of DOGE being used for transactions on X is seen as a major milestone. It would significantly enhance the utility of Dogecoin, transforming it from a meme coin into a legitimate currency for everyday transactions. This integration aligns with Musk’s vision of turning X into an “everything app,” akin to China’s WeChat, where users can handle a variety of tasks, including messaging, social networking, and payments​​​​.



In the world of cryptocurrencies, Bitcoin (BTC) is often referred to as “digital gold” due to its store of value and dominance in the market. By likening Dogecoin to “silver” in this analogy, Garner is suggesting that DOGE could become the second most significant cryptocurrency in terms of usage and popularity. This narrative shift would elevate Dogecoin from its current status as a speculative asset to a more stable and widely recognized cryptocurrency. If X successfully integrates DOGE for payments, it could lead to broader acceptance and adoption, further cementing its position alongside Bitcoin.



Garner’s observation about the strong accumulation of DOGE indicates that investors are increasingly buying and holding the cryptocurrency in anticipation of its future potential. This accumulation trend suggests that market participants are optimistic about Dogecoin’s prospects, particularly with the expected announcement from Musk regarding its integration into X​​​​.







At the time of writing, DOGE is trading at around $0.1629, up 3.4% in the past 24-hour period and up 80% in the year-to-date period.

Memecoins on the Rise: Dogecoin and Book of Meme Lead the Charge


							

Crypto users embrace DOGE and BOME in current bull cycle.



Both memecoins align despite coming from different eras.



All top 10 memecoins surged in the past 24 hours.




Dogecoin (DOGE) and Book of Meme (BOME) are surging in tandem, leading the charge among memecoins in the current crypto bull run.



Despite launching at different times, both memecoins exhibit correlated price movements, as evidenced by their nearly identical daily chart patterns. However, DOGE and BOME possess unique characteristics, suggesting they might endure the coming bull cycle.



DOGE currently holds the undisputed crown as the top memecoin on CoinmarketCap, boasting a hefty market cap of $23.68 billion. This dog-themed favorite rose to prominence during the last bull run, fueled by endorsements from Tesla CEO Elon Musk and a meteoric price surge. While DOGE dipped during the bear market, it appears to be regaining its former vigor.



BOME, a newcomer launched in March, sits at number 8 on CoinmarketCap with a market cap of $929.2 million. Though it hasn’t witnessed a bull cycle yet, BOME’s trajectory mirrors DOGE, even down to its daily chart trends. Notably, both memecoins gained roughly 4% in the last 24 hours, hinting at a potential rally.



 
 




DOGE and BOME are merely two representatives of the ever-expanding memecoin army on CoinmarketCap. Collectively, memecoins hold a significant $65.27 billion market cap, representing a noteworthy 5.33% slice of the entire crypto market capitalization. This sector is experiencing a surge in popularity, fueled by resurfacing speculative tendencies among crypto users.



Besides users’ habits, memecoin visibility is on the rise, supported by the influx of innovative solutions deployed across various blockchains. These solutions offer enticing speculative opportunities for crypto users seeking to capitalize on the upcoming bull run. At the time of writing, all top 10 memecoins on CoinmarketCap were trading in the green, reflecting positive returns over the past 24 hours.

Who Really Controls Ethereum? New Research Sheds Light


								In a new report, Christine Kim of the Galaxy Research team delves into the intricate governance of Ethereum, revealing how this blockchain, which underpins over 4,000 decentralized applications (dapps) and houses the largest developer community among blockchain platforms, is governed through a complex yet unofficial series of off-chain processes that involve multiple stakeholders. Ethereum, as a trailblazer in blockchain technology, follows a unique governance path distinct from Bitcoin, leaning on community-driven, decentralized processes rather than on-chain governance mechanisms.
Here’s Who Controls Ethereum
Ethereum operates a decentralized and off-chain governance system, a deliberate design to prevent undue influence by large ETH holders or potential attackers. “Ethereum’s governance is off-chain and coordinated through various community forums rather than through direct voting mechanisms embedded within the blockchain itself,” Kim notes, emphasizing the system’s resistance to manipulation. Discussions and decisions occur across various digital forums including GitHub, Ethereum Magicians, and developer calls, without direct community voting on the changes themselves.

At the core of ETH’s governance lies the Ethereum Improvement Proposal (EIP) system, which facilitates the formal proposal, discussion, and implementation of changes to the protocol. EIPs are divided into three categories: Standards Track EIPs that suggest crucial protocol changes; Meta EIPs aimed at governance alterations; and Informational EIPs that provide guidelines to enhance community practices.
“EIPs are the primary mechanism through which new features and functionalities are proposed, discussed, and implemented into the protocol,” Kim asserts, underscoring the process that ensures only well-vetted proposals influence the blockchain’s evolution.
The governance landscape of ETH is populated by a diverse array of contributors, each playing distinct yet overlapping roles. The Ethereum Foundation, although influential in the early days, now shares its significant but not unilateral influence with developers, client teams, node operators, and dapp developers. Kim points out, “No single party controls the development of the Ethereum protocol, which is a collective effort by various stakeholders in the Ethereum ecosystem.”
Core developers and client teams like Geth or Prysm hold the technical reins, integrating EIPs into the protocol and maintaining the client software. Node operators have the practical authority over changes, as they choose whether or not to adopt new software releases, essentially deciding on the activation of upgrades. Meanwhile, dapp developers provide crucial feedback and push for changes that affect their applications directly, representing the front line of users interacting with ETH’s codebase.

The report highlights the consensus-building process using the example of Ethereum’s transition to Proof-of-Stake (PoS) with The Merge. This major upgrade was not just a technical overhaul but a test of ETH’s governance model, demanding broad agreement across various stakeholders. “The transition to PoS, known as the Merge, required significant technical coordination and broad consensus across multiple stakeholder groups, demonstrating Ethereum’s capability to manage large-scale, complex changes,” Kim explains.
Looking forward, the governance is expected to face growing complexities as the platform scales and integrates new technologies. Kim suggests that the governance processes will need to adapt to maintain their effectiveness and inclusiveness. She forecasts, “Maintaining a decentralized governance model is crucial as ETH continues to scale and incorporate more complex features and upgrades.”
Kim’s comprehensive analysis concludes that Ethereum’s governance is characterized by its decentralized, community-driven approach where no single entity has control. Instead, a dynamic interaction among various stakeholders shapes the protocol’s evolution. This model not only protects the network from centralization but also encourages an environment ripe for continuous development and innovation.
At press time, ETH traded at $3,802.

Binance crypto news: the price of BNB reaches $700

The price of Binance’s crypto, Binance Coin (BNB) has recently reached $700, bringing the market value over $100 billion. Binance Coin (BNB) is therefore on the verge of a significant breakout, driven by the increase in market volatility. 
Let’s see all the details below. 

The price of Binance crypto (BNB) reaches new highs indicating a potential breakout
As anticipated, the price of BNB has risen by over 10%, reaching 710 dollars and bringing its market value to over 100 billion dollars. 
In recent days, the cryptocurrency market has shown signs of liveliness, with Binance Coin (BNB) leading the way. In the last 24 hours, BNB has seen an increase of over 10%, reaching 700 dollars.
This has once again pushed its market value beyond the threshold of 100 billion dollars, a level that had not been seen since early December 2021. 
After a bullish action in the first two months, the Binance token went through a consolidation phase, oscillating between $568 and $635. During this period, the altcoin showed significant price volatility, as evidenced by its chart.
Currently, the price of BNB is close to testing a critical resistance level, and the outcome of this test remains uncertain. 
The 50-day exponential moving average (EMA) has provided consistent support on the daily price chart, suggesting a positive outlook for the price of Binance Coin in the near future.
If the bull momentum continues, the Binance token should test the resistance level of $635. If the price manages to surpass this level, BNB could aim for its all-time high of $690.9.
However, if the market were to reverse the trend, the price of BNB could lose its bullish momentum and fall towards the crucial support level of $568 in the coming weeks.
Binance announces new trading pairs and the launch of the “Learn & Earn” program
Binance, one of the leading cryptocurrency exchanges, has announced the addition of new trading pairs to its platform. Starting from June 5, the exchange will open trading for the pairs HIGH/TRY, PEOPLE/FDUSD, and TNSR/USDC.
Along with the new trading pairs, Binance will also enable Trading Bots services for these pairs. 
These bots are designed to automate trading strategies, allowing users to execute operations based on pre-set rules, particularly useful in volatile markets.
This improvement aims to provide Binance users with more sophisticated tools to manage their trading activities. Binance offers zero maker fees on FDUSD trading pairs until further notice. 
Additionally, users will be able to benefit from discounted taker fees on all USDC spot and margin trading pairs, both existing and new. These promotions are part of Binance’s ongoing efforts to make trading more convenient for its users.
Binance has also announced the launch of the next round of its “Learn & Earn” program, which will take place from June 4, 2024, to June 18, 2024. 
During this period, KYC verified users will have the opportunity to earn rewards in cryptocurrencies by completing educational courses and quizzes. To participate, users must ensure that their Binance accounts are KYC verified. 
Once verified, they can read articles, watch videos, and complete quizzes to earn rewards until supplies last. 
Each course can be completed only once, and users can earn a maximum of one reward for each completed course.

Binance-Nigeria Spat Heats Up: US Demands Release of Detained Executive


							

The US politicians urge President Joe Biden to release Binance executive Tigran Gambaryan from Nigerian custody.



The executive is reportedly suffering from Malaria without proper medical attention.



The leaders accuse Nigerian authorities of charging Gambaryan with baseless crimes.




In a recent development in the Binance-Nigeria legal battle, US political leaders have urged President Biden to take the initiative for Binance executive Tigran Gambaryan’s release from Nigerian custody. Reportedly, the executive is currently suffering from malaria without proper medical attention.



According to a post on X shared by Fox Business reporter Eleanor Terrett, leaders, including House Committee on Foreign Affairs Chairman Michael McCaul, wrote a letter to Biden and the hostage affairs unit urging the release of Gambaryan.







In late February 2024, the Nigerian authorities arrested Binance executives Tigran Gambaryan and Nadeem Anjarwalla, alleging Binance’s involvement in a $26 billion illicit flow. The executives were detained, and their passports were seized.



Subsequently, a series of events unfolded, including the executives’ lawsuits against the Nigerian authorities, Binance CEO Richard Teng’s bribery claims against the authority, and delays in Gambaryan’s trial.



Last week, when Gambaryan was produced for his trial, he collapsed in court due to severe health conditions. Later, it was suspected that the executive was suffering from malaria. Gambaryan’s wife, Yuki Gambaryan, complained of the Nigerian authorities’ negligence to provide adequate treatment for her husband despite the court order.



In the recent letter addressed to President Biden, Secretary Antony Blinken, and the Presidential Envoy for Hostage Affairs Roger D. Carstens, the political leaders asserted that the Binance executive is “wrongfully detained” by the authority. They added,




 “We fear for his life. Immediate action is essential to ensure his safety and preservice his life. We must act swiftly before it is too late.”




Furthermore, the leaders accused the Nigerian authority of charging Gambaryan with multiple “baseless” crimes, including tax evasion and money laundering. The leaders addressed the matter as the authorities’ coercion tactic to threaten Binance.

Ethereum Hinting at Altcoin Rebound Ahead of Potential ‘Super Euphoria’ Phase: Glassnode Founders - The Daily Hodl


								The founders of crypto analytics platform Glassnode believe Ethereum (ETH) may break out ahead of a possible “super euphoria” crypto phase.
The co-founders of Glassnode, who go by the handle Negentropic on the social media platform X, tell their 63,000 followers that Ethereum against Bitcoin (ETH/BTC) may be printing a bullish reversal pattern.










According to the analysts, the ETH/BTC breakout could signal big gains are in store for alts in June, which has historically been a well-performing month for altcoin projects.
“Looking ahead: altcoin market moves. Despite Ethereum’s price action, JASMY, RLC and PEPE show strong rallies. The ETH/BTC chart suggests a trend reversal as Ethereum outperforms Bitcoin following the ETH exchange-traded fund [19b-4 forms] approval. Historically, June has been favorable for altcoins. Will the trend continue?”
ETH/BTC is trading for 0.0542 BTC ($3,773) at time of writing, down nearly 1% in the past 24 hours.
The analysts suggest that digital assets may soon be soaring to new all-time highs (ATHs) along with the stock price of tech company MicroStrategy due to its large holdings of Bitcoin.
“Opinion: could we be heading towards ‘super euphoria’ in crypto? MicroStrategy has been betting their entire business on BTC. And has been successful so far. Its share price already exceeds the level from 2021. How much more could MSTR rally? Elliott Wave structure and Fibonacci gives us a possible target above ATHs from year 2000. This will only happen if euphoria keeps building in BTC and crypto.”
Source: Negentropic/X
Looking at the analysts’ chart, they suggest MicroStrategy could soar to $3,560, more than 118% of the current value, based on the Elliott Wave theory and Fibonacci extensions.
The Elliott Wave theory states that a bullish asset often witnesses a five-wave surge where waves one, three and five are upside moves and waves two and four are corrective periods.
Traders use Fibonacci extensions in technical analysis to estimate profit targets and price pullbacks. They are based on Fibonacci ratios.
MicroStrategy is trading for $1,631 at time of writing, up 3.6% in the last 24 hours. Meanwhile, Bitcoin is trading for $70,282 at time of writing, up nearly 2% in the last 24 hours.

Algorand: The Sleeping Giant of Layer 1 Blockchains? Data Shows Strong Fundamentals


							

Algorand has over 54,000 daily active addresses, surpassing Dogecoin and Avalanche.



ALGO tokens are held, on average, for nearly 11 months.



The holders increased their holdings from 19.4% since May.




Algorand stands out in the crowded Layer 1 blockchain space with its impressive performance metrics, but price action lags behind, according to IntotheBlock data.



Renowned for its high capacity, fast transaction finality, low fees, and carbon-neutral stance, Algorand boasts over 54,000 daily active addresses, surpassing networks like Dogecoin (52,000) and Avalanche (48,000), and ranks fifth in active users among leading protocols.



Transaction activity on Algorand has surged, doubling since late 2023. The current seven-day average is 1.36 million transactions per day. Notably, most transactions are small, with 96.43% valued at under $1, likely driven by automated transactions and smart contract interactions.



ALGO tokens are held, on average, for nearly 11 months, signifying substantial holder confidence. This holding period exceeds Avalanche’s 5.9 months and nearly matches Cardano’s one-year average. The network’s large holders, who control 20.7% of the total supply, have increased their holdings from 19.4% since May, suggesting ongoing accumulation and potential confidence in future growth.



Despite the robust network activity and confidence from large holders, most ALGO holders are currently at a loss, with only 9% in profit at current prices, according to IntotheBlock.




“Algorand’s active user base, increasing transaction activity, and the confidence shown by large holders indicate solid fundamentals. Nonetheless, price development has been slow, with only 7% of its holders currently in profit.”




Additionally, Algorand’s low transaction costs, typically around 0.001 ALGO per transaction, make it highly economical for high volumes of transactions.

Shiba Inu Whale Returns: 323 Billion SHIB Bought After Years Of Inactivity | Bitcoinist.com


								In a surprising move that has caught the attention of the cryptocurrency community, a dormant Shiba Inu whale has awakened after several years of inactivity to purchase a staggering 323 billion SHIB tokens, valued at $8 million.
This acquisition highlights the renewed investor interest and confidence in the memecoin amid favorable market conditions. Also, it represents the first activity from the whale wallet since 2021, which happened when SHIB was trading at $0.000025.
Shiba Inu Whale Stack Up Holdings
The development was reported by popular on-chain tracker Spot On Chain on the X (formerly Twitter) platform. According to data from Etherscan, this recent acquisition was executed in 156 distinct large transactions.

At the time of the initial report, the buyer had exchanged about 1,000 Wrapped Ethereum (WETH), estimated at $3.83 million, for 149.3 billion SHIB in the last hour. However, the whale address continued its buying frenzy acquiring an additional 173 billion SHIB, bringing the total tokens to 323 billion SHIB. In under three hours, the address exchanged 2,188 WETH for 323 billion Shiba Inu tokens, valued at $8.29 million, before the end of the 156 transfers.
Spot On Chain also noted that the last Shiba Inu transaction carried out by the whale 3 years ago before going dormant was selling over 167 billion SHIB, valued at $6.13 million at the time. Specifically, these coins were acquired from a super early purchaser seen buying 5.16 trillion SHIB for just 45 Ethereum (ETH) worth $63,700 in 2021. A few months later after obtaining the 167 billion SHIB in that same year, the address staked every token. Furthermore, 3 months later, on October 24, 2021, the buyer unstacked the tokens and earned an extra 12.9 million SHIB. However, on the same day, the whale went on to sell off every one of the 167 billion Shiba Inu tokens.
Although there are no further activities from the whale regarding the recently acquired SHIB, Spot On Chain has highlighted that the buyer might move on to purchase more SHIB, as his wallet still holds a whopping 1,169 WETH, worth approximately $4.45 million.
Given the renewed optimism surrounding the meme coin sector, the buyer must have returned to acquire this massive amount of SHIB. Over the past week, the meme coin sector has garnered significant adoption and interest from crypto investors and even top figures in the music and entertainment industry.
SHIB Whales On A Buying Spree
It is important to note that SHIB whales have been on a buying spree for a while now. Last month, crypto analytics platform IntoTheBlock, revealed that Shiba Inu whales have been steadily gathering SHIB, indicating a high level of confidence in SHIB’s long-term prospects.

Due to this, the crypto asset became one of the most traded coins by whales within the month, having amassed around 30 trillion SHIB through large whale transactions.

U.S. behind in stablecoin regulation? Former CFTC execs weigh in - AMBCrypto



Stablecoin adoption grows, but complex US regulations hinder progress.
Tether’s influence raises concerns about US regulatory and taxation disparity.

The United States economy has witnessed a sea change in sentiment regarding cryptocurrency. Starting with the approval of spot Bitcoin [BTC] ETFs, followed by the preliminary approval of Ethereum [ETH] ETFs, and now the crypto-influenced presidential election. 
All these events highlight the US’s softening approach towards the industry. Amidst these dynamic changes, one question arises: How will these shifts affect stablecoins? 
In the recent ‘Unchained’ podcast, former CFTC chief innovation officer Daniel Gorfine emphasized that U.S.-backed stablecoins offer a key opportunity for the U.S. to strengthen its financial dominance.
However, he noted that the U.S. has been slow to develop federal regulations for stablecoins. He said, 
“There are many global jurisdictions that are moving forward with rules and standards around stablecoins including dollar-backed stablecoins and that will happen before the US does anything at the federal level.” 
Additionally, defying the risks cryptocurrencies bring to the financial system, Gorfine underlined that it’s Bitcoin that initiated discussions about new financial infrastructures, including stablecoins and CBDCs.
The need for stablecoins
In fact, since cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin are highly volatile, it’s stablecoins that come to the rescue. Their value remains stable as they are pegged to fiat currencies like the U.S. dollar, making them dependable digital assets. 
Needless to say, the growing adoption of these coins is evident as big industry players like Stripe and PayPal have started accepting stablecoins, such as USDC, for mainstream payment functions. 
Adding to the fray, Former CFTC chairman Chris Giancarlo in the same conversation noted, 
“I find stablecoins to be potentially a great way to satisfy an unmet global demand for dollar exposure.” 
These discussions emphasize stablecoins’ capacity to shake up traditional payments and protect the US dollar’s global standing.
However, if we look at the flip side of the story, the complex US regulatory landscape presents hurdles for stablecoin expansion. 
US’s regulatory framework in question
Thus, by proposing the use of the dual banking system model, which involves both state and federal regulatory oversight, Gorfine added, 
“This shouldn’t be as complicated as we’re making it…I think we could create coherent oversight of stable coin issuers quite readily.” 
While countries like Singapore efficiently license US dollar-based stablecoin issuers, the US still struggles with establishing a coherent regulatory framework for its own currency.

What is the Reason for the Rise in Bitcoin and Altcoins? Will the Rise Continue? Analysts Pointed to Friday! - Bitcoin Sistemi

There has been a healthy upward recovery in Bitcoin and altcoins in the last 24 hours, with the BTC price rising above $71,000.
While this rise in Bitcoin was accompanied by altcoins, BNB increased by 12.3% in the last 24 hours, rising above $ 700 and refreshing its ATH.


FLOKI 30% outside BNB; Uniswap (UNI) and ORDI ranked first among the most profitable altcoins in the market with their rise of 18.7% and 17.4%.
Behind this rise was the JOLTS data announced by the US Department of Labor for April and the record entry in US spot Bitcoin ETFs after a long time.





Evaluating the JOLTS data, Oxford Economics economist Nancy Vanden Houten said, “The FED will welcome signs that the situation in the labor market has calmed down, but the JOLTS data does not change our view that the FED will keep interest rates at current levels until September.”
While market analysts consider the latest rise as an indicator that BTC is on its way to a new ATH, QCP Capital analysts said in their latest report that the rise in BTC may continue after the US data to be announced on Friday.


QCP Capital said that the Non-Farm Employment data to be announced on Friday in the USA will bring an increase to the Bitcoin and cryptocurrency markets.
Stating that there are many positive developments in the market other than the US data, analysts stated that these events include large inflows in US spot BTC ETFs, Thailand SEC's approval of the first spot BTC ETF and the launch of Australia's first spot BTC ETF.





At this point, analysts stated that bullish expectations for Bitoin continue and said that Friday's non-agricultural employment data will play a critical role in this rise.

“As a result of new developments on the Spot Bitcoin ETF front, the unprecedented influx of traditional capital worldwide into Bitcoin will undoubtedly support the BTC price.
We expect this upward momentum in Bitcoin to increase further with NFP on Friday. Markets price the possibility of a rate cut in June and July as 0%. A weaker NFP figure could change this situation. “This could be the catalyst to break all-time highs.”

Bitcoin continues to trade at $71,128 at the time of writing.

Spot On Chain's recent findings highlight significant activity on the Shiba Inu (SHIB) token market, as early investors acquired a substantial amount of SHIB again. This sudden influx into old wallets, nearing one trillion SHIB, raised speculation about a potential pump in the Shiba Inu token price similar to the 2021 bull run.Thus, it is reported that one early buyer whale spent 1,000 WETH, worth about $3.83 million, for 149.3 billion SHIB. These tokens were deposited from a wallet, which got 5.16 trillion SHIB for just 45 ETH in March 2021. The buyer still has 1,169 WETH, worth about $4.45 million, which could be used for more SHIB purchases, as suggested. Another early buyer has returned to the market after a two-year absence. Over the past few hours, this entity bought 4,849 WETH for 715.8 billion SHIB, impacting the increase of the price of SHIB. With 9,207 ETH and WETH, worth approximately $34.9 million, still in possession, this entity may continue to accumulate SHIB too.2021 again?The Shiba Inu token, introduced in 2021 and reaching a peak price of $0.0000857 during the bull market, is currently trading at $0.0000262. The renewed interest from early investors suggests they believe in SHIB's future.SHIB to USD by CoinMarketCapAs these early investors make strategic moves on the SHIB market, enthusiasts watch closely. Substantial investments and calculated acquisitions by once super early investors could signal a bullish trend for Shiba Inu, similar to the gains seen in 2021. However, whether this indicates anticipation of a real bull market on their side or remains speculation is yet to be seen.

Dollar Tree Misses Q1 Revenue, Will Reconsider Family Dollar Strategy - Tokenist


					
Neither the author, Tim Fries, nor this website, The Tokenist, provide financial advice. Please consult our website policy prior to making financial decisions.



Dollar Tree, Inc. (NASDAQ: DLTR) has reported its financial results for the first quarter of fiscal 2024, which ended on May 4, 2024. The company achieved a consolidated net sales increase of 4.2% year-over-year, reaching $7.63 billion. However, the company’s diluted earnings per share (EPS) was $1.38, slightly below the adjusted diluted EPS of $1.43. The same-store net sales for Dollar Tree increased by 1.7%, while Family Dollar saw a marginal increase of 0.1%, leading to an enterprise-wide same-store net sales growth of 1.0%.



Rick Dreiling, Chairman and CEO of Dollar Tree, expressed satisfaction with the adjusted EPS results, which were toward the high end of the company’s outlook range. CFO Jeff Davis highlighted that the operating performance remained solid despite a soft Easter season, attributing the results to disciplined operations and careful expense management. The company opened 116 new Dollar Tree stores and 41 new Family Dollar stores while converting 926 Dollar Tree stores to a multi-price format.



The gross profit increased by 5.3% to $2.35 billion, with a gross margin expansion of 30 basis points to 30.8%. This expansion was primarily driven by reduced freight costs, partially offset by a higher mix of lower-margin consumables and increased shrink. Selling, general, and administrative expenses rose to 25.3% of total revenue, up from 24.8% the previous year, driven by temporary labor costs, higher depreciation, and severance costs related to store closures.



Dollar Tree Reports $1.43 Adjusted EPS, $7.63 Billion in Q1 Revenue



The first quarter results showed that Dollar Tree, Inc. fell slightly short of Wall Street’s expectations. Analysts had anticipated an EPS of $1.43 and revenue of $7.65 billion. The company’s reported EPS of $1.38 was below the expected figure, although the adjusted diluted EPS matched the expectations at $1.43. The company’s revenue of $7.63 billion was marginally lower than the anticipated $7.65 billion.



Despite these slight misses, the company demonstrated resilience in several key areas. The increase in gross profit and gross margin indicates effective cost management, especially in reducing freight costs. However, the higher selling, general, and administrative expenses reflect the challenges faced in operational adjustments, including the multi-price rollout and store closures. These factors contributed to the operating income margin decline from 5.7% to 5.5%, and the adjusted operating income margin from 6.1% to 5.7%.



The same-store sales growth, particularly the 1.7% increase in Dollar Tree stores, was a positive indicator, driven by a 2.8% increase in traffic. Conversely, Family Dollar’s same-store sales growth of 0.1% was less impressive, driven by a modest 0.9% increase in traffic. These mixed results underscore the need for ongoing strategic adjustments, particularly in the Family Dollar segment.





Dollar Tree Reiterates Full Year Outlook, Expects $31B to $32B in Net Sales



Looking ahead, Dollar Tree, Inc. has reiterated its full-year fiscal 2024 consolidated net sales outlook range of $31.0 billion to $32.0 billion. The company expects comparable net sales growth in the low-to-mid-single digits for the enterprise, mid-single digits for the Dollar Tree segment, and low-single digits for the Family Dollar segment. Adjusted diluted EPS for the fiscal year is projected to range from $6.50 to $7.00.



The company’s guidance reflects incremental transportation and other expenses related to the loss of its Marietta distribution center, estimated to impact EPS by $0.20 to $0.30 for the full year. For the second quarter, Dollar Tree anticipates consolidated net sales between $7.3 billion and $7.6 billion, with adjusted diluted EPS ranging from $1.00 to $1.10. This outlook includes an estimated $0.10 impact from the Marietta distribution center loss.



Dollar Tree’s strategic initiatives, including the rapid rollout of multi-price stores and the optimization of its store portfolio, remain on track. The company plans to close additional stores as part of its portfolio optimization, having already closed approximately 550 stores in the first quarter. These closures are expected to enhance long-term operational efficiency and profitability.



Dollar Tree Announces Formal Review of Strategic Alternatives for Family Dollar Business Segment



Dollar Tree announced a formal review of strategic alternatives for its Family Dollar business segment in a significant strategic move. This review could result in a potential sale, spin-off, or other disposition of the business. The company has not set a definitive timetable for the completion of this review, and there is no assurance that it will result in any specific transaction or outcome.



Additionally, the company faced a significant challenge when a tornado destroyed its distribution center in Marietta, Oklahoma, on April 28, 2024. The facility and its inventory were deemed unsalvageable, resulting in losses totaling $117.0 million. However, Dollar Tree expects these losses to be fully offset by insurance recoveries, though the exact amount and timing of these recoveries remain uncertain.



Dollar Tree’s proactive approach to addressing these challenges, including the strategic review of Family Dollar and the rapid response to the tornado damage, reflects its commitment to maintaining operational resilience and pursuing long-term growth opportunities.

AI sets Shiba Inu (SHIB) price for June 30, 2024


    As the majority of assets in the cryptocurrency market start to make significant advances, Shiba Inu (SHIB) is no exception, having already gained close to 9% to its price in just the past 24 hours, and artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning algorithms predict more gains.



Indeed, Shiba Inu is recovering from last week’s underperformance, proceeding on its path to make this year an exceptionally successful one in which it has already advanced nearly 150%, driven by positive developments such as an astonishing increase in the number of new accounts on Shibarium.



SHIB price prediction



So, how high will Shiba Inu go? According to the advanced algorithms deployed by the crypto analytics and forecasting platform PricePredictions, SHIB could reach the price of $0.000029 by June 30, 2024, according to the most recent projections retrieved by Finbold on June 5.







30-day SHIB price forecast. Source: PricePredictions



If these predictions, which rely on technical analysis (TA) indicators like relative strength index (RSI), moving average convergence divergence (MACD), and others, come true, they would represent an increase of 12.45% from the price of Shiba Inu at press time.



SHIB price analysis



For now, SHIB is changing hands at the price of $0.00002579, suggesting an increase of 8.28% in the last 24 hours, recovering from the loss of 5.69% accumulated across the past seven days, adding up to the 4.10% gain on its monthly chart and resuming the 149.22% advance this year, as per data on June 5.

So why is Shiba Inu going up? Notably, the welcome price change to the upside coincides with a significant increase in activity on Shiba Inu’s blockchain platform, Shibarium, which has seen the number of new accounts rise by 3,336.67% in just 24 hours, soaring from 30 on June 3 to 1,031 overnight.

It is also worth noting that early Bitcoin (BTC) adopter and crypto trading expert DaVinci Jeremie has recently shared his views that Shiba Inu’s price will rally soon, opining that the currently 11th-largest asset in the crypto sector by market capitalization would hit $0.00006, a 132.65% increase from its current levels.







All things considered, SHIB could, indeed, hit the projected price by the end of this month, provided the positive sentiment continues. However, things in this industry can sometimes change on a whim, so doing one’s own due diligence, keeping up with any Shiba Inu news and trends is critical.

The exchange DMM Bitcoin aims to compensate users after the hack

The Japanese cryptocurrency exchange DMM Bitcoin recently announced that it will aim to raise 320 million dollars to compensate users after a significant hack. 
DMM Bitcoin therefore aims to compensate users for their loss by raising equivalent funds. Let’s see all the details below. 

The Japanese exchange DMM Bitcoin victim of a $320 million hack announces a compensation plan
As anticipated, DMM Bitcoin, a Japanese cryptocurrency exchange recently victim of a hack that led to the loss of 320 million dollars in Bitcoin, plans to raise 50 billion yen (320 million dollars) to compensate the users.
In a statement released on June 5, DMM Bitcoin explained that it will recover the stolen funds by procuring an equivalent amount of Bitcoin (BTC) from its group company, DMM.com.
The exchange assured users that it will seek to minimize the impact on the market with these purchases. The company also clarified that the investigation into the “unauthorized outflow” of 4,503 BTC on May 31 is still ongoing. 
DMM Bitcoin has deeply apologized for the situation and the inconvenience caused to customers, promising to continue investigations to determine the cause of the incident and to update the public on any new developments.
To finance the compensation, DMM Bitcoin borrowed five billion yen (32 million dollars) on June 3. 
Additional 48 billion yen (308 million dollars) will be raised on June 7 and another 2 billion yen (12.8 million dollars) through subordinated debt financing on June 10. 
This financial support, coming from DMM.com, will guarantee the necessary funds to secure the customers’ Bitcoin holdings.
The DMM Bitcoin incident, classified as the eighth largest hack in the history of criptovalute, is among the top ten largest cryptocurrency exchange hacks of all time.
The largest remains the hack of the Ronin Network in March 2022, which exploited the network’s validator nodes, leading to the theft of 620 million dollars. 
In response, Ronin has significantly updated its security measures, introduced a bug bounty of 1 million dollars, and doubled the number of validator nodes to prevent future attacks.
The $2 million hack in crypto from an OKX account: case of deepfake and vulnerability
Recently, a client of the cryptocurrency exchange OKX was also a victim of a theft of 2 million dollars in cryptocurrencies, according to WuBlock.
The scammers “acquired” the identity information of Lai Japanese Fang Chang through a data breach on Telegram. 
Exploiting this information, they accessed Chang’s OKX account and took control of it through the “password dimenticata” option.
Assuming the identity of Chang, the scammers modified all his security settings, including the email ID, phone number, and Google authenticator settings, even using a deepfake video of the victim.
Within 24 hours of the user’s report, their account suffered a loss of over 2 million dollars in various cryptocurrencies. 
OKX has acknowledged the theft of the account and is assisting the victim in recovering the account, in addition to having taken legal action against the aggressors.
This incident adds to other attacks suffered by OKX in the past, including a previous attack on an OKX wallet and an exploit on OKX Dex. 
Centralized cryptocurrency exchanges continue to be a common target for attackers, who now also use advanced tools such as deepfake videos, raising ethical concerns about the use of intelligenza artificiale in the sector.

BONK Bulls Defend Rally Despite Bear Interference


Leading meme coin Bonk (BONK) has continued to trend within an ascending channel despite the recent growth in bearish bias towards it.
An assessment of its key indicators revealed a sustained appetite for the meme coin despite the profit-taking activity of a few market participants.
Bonk Bears Put Pressure on its Price
At press time, BONK exchanged hands at $0.000034. The token’s value has rallied by 25% in the last month. This price rally led to the forming of an ascending channel, which BONK attempted to close above its upper line on May 27.

Despite the rally, some bearish activity has lingered in the BONK market. The negative weighted sentiment that BONK has recorded since May 30 highlights the bearish bias toward the altcoin. At press time, BONK’s weighted sentiment was -0.79.

When an asset’s weighted sentiment is less than zero, it indicates that the overall online conversation surrounding that asset is negative.
This bearish sentiment can also be gleaned in the meme coin’s futures market. Its futures open interest has declined since the beginning of June. At $14.62 million at press time, it has since dropped by 18%.

BONK’s futures open interest tracks the total number of outstanding futures contracts or positions that have not been closed or settled. When it declines, it signals a drop in market activity as traders exit their trading positions without opening new ones. 

It is often interpreted as a negative change in traders’ sentiment. 
BONK Price Prediction: The Bulls Still Hold Momentum
While some traders have taken to selling their BONK tokens, bullish presence in the meme coin market is still significant. 
Readings from its Relative Strength Index (RSI) showed that buying momentum outweighs selling pressure. As of this writing, BONK’s RSI was 62.25. 
This indicator measures the momentum of an asset’s price movement. When it returns a value above 70, the asset is considered overbought and due for a correction. Conversely, an RSI below 30 is considered oversold, indicating the price may have fallen too far and could be ready for a rebound.

Also, BONK’s positive Elder-Ray Index confirms bull strength. As of this writing, the indicator rested above the zero line at 0.0000079. This indicator measures the relationship between the strength of buyers and sellers in the market. 
When its value is positive, it means that bull power dominates the market.

If buying pressure continues to outweigh selling activity, BONK may continue its uptrend to break above the upper line of its ascending channel at $0.000045.

However, if bearish sentiments increase, the token’s price may drop toward $0.000027.

SEC Salt Lake Office Shut Down: Coinbase Lawyer Slams "Attrition" Claim


							

The SEC announces the closure of its Salt Lake Regional Office (SLRO), citing a significant attrition.



The move follows the SEC’s failure in the Debt Box case, where the judge accused the agency of bad faith conduct.



Paul Grewal criticizes the use of the term attrition, asking whether it refers to the judge’s unprecedented sanctions.




The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has announced the closure of its Salt Lake Regional Office (SLRO), citing “significant attrition.” This decision follows a court ruling against the SEC in the Debt Box lawsuit, and Coinbase lawyer Paul Grewal criticized the SEC’s use of the term “attrition.”







The SEC recently faced a setback in the Debt Box case when District Court Judge Robert J. Shelby condemned the agency for their “bad faith conduct.” The SEC previously accused Debt Box of a $50 million fraud scheme. However, the judge dismissed the case, ordering the SEC to pay $1.75 million to cover legal fees and other expenses.









In its recent press release, the SEC disclosed its decision to shut down SLRO, reducing the regulator’s regional offices from 11 to 10. The agency stated that SLRO had been the SEC’s smallest regional office. The SEC elaborated:




 “The agency considered its budget and organizational efficiency in deciding to close the office, and it has no plans to close any other regional offices. All current staff will be aligned to existing SEC organizational components based on their current functions and agency mission needs.” 




Commenting on the SEC’s decision and the word “attrition” mentioned in the press release, Coinbase Chief Legal Officer Grewal rebuked, “Attrition—is that what we are calling unprecedented misrepresentations and bad faith warranting unprecedented sanctions by a federal judge?.” Further, reflecting on the SEC’s anti-crypto stance and crypto lawsuits, Grewal remarked, “All that talk of ‘cops’ and ‘Wild West’ from a civil agency with zero criminal jurisdiction.”

Leveraged Ether ETFs Enter The Market - The Defiant

The first 2x long Ether ETF launched on June 4, while the first 2x short Ether ETF will debut on June 7.New Ethereum ETFs are entering the market, with Volatility Shares launching the first 2x leveraged Ether ETF on June 4 and ProShares set to launch two leveraged exchange-traded funds investing in ETH derivatives this week.On June 4, Volatility Shares, an issuer of leveraged and inverse ETFs, launched its 2x Ether ETF (ETHU). ETHU became the first 2x leveraged Ether ETF to operate in the United States and hosted $5 million in volume on its first day of trade, according to Bloomberg.Eric Balchunas, a senior ETF analyst at Bloomberg, described ETHU’s debut performance as “great for a new launch,” with ETHU processing more volume than all unleveraged Ether futures ETFs did on their first day combined. “Still pretty microscopic vs anything Bitcoin,” he added.On June 4. ProShares, an ETF issuer, announced that the ProShares Ultra Ether ETF (ETHT) and ProShares UltraShort Ether ETF (ETHD) will debut on the New York Stock Exchange on June 7. ETHT and ETHD offer investors long and short exposure to Ether at 2x leverage, respectively. ProShares said ETHD will comprise the first 2x short ETF to launch in the United States.“These new ETFs are designed to address the challenge of acquiring leveraged or short exposure to Ether, which can be onerous and expensive,” said Michael Sapir, the CEO of ProShares CEO. “ETHT offers investors the opportunity to pursue magnified Ether returns or target a level of exposure with less money at risk. ETHD allows investors to seek profit when the price of Ether drops or hedge their ether exposure.”Defiance ETFs also filed for a 2x leveraged Ether ETF in April.The news comes as analysts anticipate the first spot Ether ETFs will launch in the United States within the coming months.Spot ETFs differ from derivatives-based funds by holding the underlying asset they track, which can exert bullish buying pressure on the asset’s markets. For example, spot Bitcoin ETFs have accumulated nearly $15 billion worth of BTC since debuting in early January, according to Sosovalue.While the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission approved the 19b-4 filings from spot Ether ETF applicants on May 23, the regulator still needs to greenlight the funds’ S-1 registration statements. The SEC requested amended S-1 statements from the applicants by May 31.Balchunas recently tweeted that he believes it would be possible for the funds to debut in late June, early July is a more realistic timeline. However, Nate Geraci, co-founder of the ETF Institute, posted that it could take up to three months for the spot Ether ETFs to begin trading.The price of ETH is up 1.2% over the past 24 hours after trending sideways this week. ETH last changed hands for $3,797, according to CoinGecko.

BlackRock and Citadel support the Texas Stock Exchange open to crypto

BlackRock and Citadel Securities are ready to support the launch of the new national stock exchange in Texas, the Texas Stock Exchange (TXSE), which is favorable to listing crypto companies. 

BlackRock and Citadel support the new Texas Stock Exchange favorable to the crypto sector
BlackRock e Citadel Securities have stepped in to support the launch of a new national stock exchange, the Texas Stock Exchange (TXSE). 

“BlackRock and Citadel intend to launch a new national stock exchange in Texas to compete with the New York Stock Exchange.”
In practice, the company behind TXSE would have already obtained financing of about 120 million dollars, and it seems to have also won over the world’s largest asset manager, BlackRock, and the market maker of Citadel. 
Not only that, the Texas Stock Exchange seems to have the intention of filing the registration statements with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) of the United States towards the end of 2024. 
The new TXSE will therefore be a new more competitive alternative compared to the two main US stock exchanges, the Nasdaq and the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE). 
From what has emerged, the competition could lead the new stock exchange to be more favorable to the crypto sector, listing ETFs and cryptocurrency companies that decide to do so. 
BlackRock and Citadel supporting the Texas Stock Exchange and the listing of crypto companies
At the moment, on X, there is a strong enthusiasm for the present news. Here are some examples of comments about it: 

“Texas Stock Exchange? BlackRock and Citadel support a group that intends to start a new national exchange. They would try to list ETFs. via @cdriebusch”

“BlackRock and Citadel intend to launch a new national stock exchange in Texas to compete with the New York Stock Exchange! Here is a video of the CEO of BlackRock explaining how tokenization is the next evolution of finance… “Every stock, every bond” will be tokenized. “
The company or group behind the TXSE would therefore welcome more crypto companies, compared to the other exchanges already present. 
So far, in fact, there are few cryptocurrency companies on Nasdaq, including the crypto-exchange Coinbase and the main Bitcoin mining companies, such as Riot Platforms and Marathon Digital.
The update on the request to issue a spot Ethereum ETF
The present news of BlackRock and Citadel behind the launch of the Texas Stock Exchange, comes after a week in which the largest global asset manager made its request to the SEC on Ethereum Spot ETFs.
In practice, BlackRock has submitted an update to the SEC on its request to issue a spot Ethereum ETF, after they had already been approved the previous week.
In this regard, the ETF expert, Eric Balchaunas, stated that one could consider the hypothesis that the landing of spot Ethereum ETFs on the US exchanges could happen at the end of June.

Donald Trump's Crypto Stash Reaches $30 Million Because People Keep Sending Him Meme Coins - Decrypt

We do the research, you get the alpha!Get exclusive reports and access to key insights on airdrops, NFTs, and more! Subscribe now to Alpha Reports and up your game!Go to Alpha ReportsFans of former president and convicted felon Donald Trump have been flooding his crypto wallet with meme coins and donations since his guilty verdict was handed down last week.That influx has been enough to push the value of his holdings above $30 million, according to blockchain analytics firm Arkham Intelligence.In the past couple days, a wallet that's been linked to Donald Trump by Arkham Intelligence has seen its Trog (TROG) meme coin holdings grow to $19.5 million at the time of writing.That's in part because of the team behind the Trog, short for Trump Frog. The meme coin describes itself as "the meme coin that’s here to make crypto great again" on its website.The TROG team airdropped half of the coin's 420,690,000 supply to Trump, making him the single largest holder by far. And now the TROG price has skyrocketed 190% in the past 24 hours, according to DexTools. Of course, were Trump to attempt to sell his TROG holdings—if he's even aware he has them—the price would likely plummet given its low liquidity.Keep in mind that none of this is happening in a vacuum.Since Trump was found guilty on Friday, May 31, the price of Ethereum has risen slightly. And although Trump sold $2.4 million worth of ETH in December (after his third failed NFT launch), his crypto wallet still holds 471 ETH that's worth approximately $1.8 million at today's prices.But that's nothing compared to the $7.8 million worth of the MAGA (TRUMP) Ethereum meme coin held in the former president's wallet.The TRUMP coin initially took a nosedive, then surged to an all-time high of $16.84 not long after the judge's verdict was announced. But it didn't stop there. By June 1, the TRUMP token reached its current all-time high of $17.51, according to CoinGecko.At the time of writing, TRUMP is trading for $13.49 after having gained 2.5% since this time yesterday.Much of the political meme coin blitz seems to be tied to degens trying to play the market as the clock ticks down to Trump's sentencing for the New York hush money case on July 11. Each of the 34 counts he was found guilty of carries a maximum penalty of 4 years in prison. But the sentencing will ultimately come down to the judge's discretion.Apart from the hush money conviction, Trump is also facing 37 federal charges for the illegal retention of documents and obstruction of justice in connection with allegations he kept classified documents after his presidency ended in 2021. There's also a pending election subversion case that's been filed in Georgia for his alleged efforts to overturn the 2020 election results.Edited by Stephen Graves.Daily Debrief NewsletterStart every day with the top news stories right now, plus original features, a podcast, videos and more.

A major turning point for the cryptocurrency market was recently reached by Bitcoin, which reached an all-time high on one of its most important charts. In order to highlight the macroeconomic factors driving Bitcoin's current bull run, the chart in question shows the relationship between global liquidity (M2) and the price of the cryptocurrency. At the moment, Bitcoin is trading at roughly $70,868 - clearly on the rise. A strong bullish trend is evident in the chart, which shows a sequence of higher highs and lows. Moving averages are among the key technical indicators that point to further upward pressure. Bitcon/USDT Chart by TradingViewBy breaking through key resistance levels, the price has solidified its position above $70,000. Growing trading volumes, which indicate strong buying interest, are supporting this breakout. A more comprehensive view is offered by the second chart, which displays the price of Bitcoin in relation to global liquidity (M2). With a staggering $94 trillion in global liquidity, the price of Bitcoin closely follows it. In the past, growing Bitcoin prices have frequently coincided with increases in worldwide liquidity. This relationship highlights Bitcoins as a store of value and a hedge against inflation in a time of loose monetary policy. Aggressive monetary policies by central banks in response to economic difficulties are primarily to blame for the spike in global liquidity. Investors are looking to Bitcoin as a hedge against the possible devaluation of fiat currencies as a result of the unprecedented amounts of money being pumped into the global economy. The market's increased confidence in Bitcoin's long-term value proposition is reflected in the price of the cryptocurrency, which has reached local highs as a result of this liquidity inflow. Technical analysis indicates that there are multiple bullish indicators on the price chart of Bitcoin. The daily chart's moving averages confirm the bullish trend further, with the 50-day moving average moving above the 200-day moving average. Further more, with higher volumes on up days compared to down days, the volume trends support the price action.

Ethereum Gaming Network Xai Launches Bootcamp to Bring Web2 Devs Into Crypto - Decrypt

The Xai Foundation, the core contributor to the Ethereum layer-3 gaming network Xai built on Arbitrum, announced Wednesday that it has teamed up with venture capital firm Outlier Ventures to help bring more traditional or “Web2” developers into the space.The Xai Tokenomics Bootcamp is designed to streamline the development process for new blockchain games and help support the transition of existing Web2 games into models that work well with crypto infrastructure. Developers can tap Outlier Ventures' expertise in areas such as game asset ownership, token utilization, player rewards, and enhanced security.According to the companies, two games have already completed the bootcamp’s pilot phase, including The Lost Glitches—a card-battling game that had previously launched NFTs on rival Ethereum scaling network Immutable X, and was recently announced to be migrating to Xai. The other title has yet to be revealed."Part of the issue with building games for Web3 is that most developers are coming from Web2 roots, with virtually no understanding of how to implement a game on-chain," said Tobias Batton, founder and CEO of Ex Populus, one of the core teams supporting Xai. "Thanks to the incredible partnership with Outlier Ventures, our Tokenomics Bootcamp can now provide developers who are new to the space with the tools they need to build the next generation of games."Xai launched earlier this year with a sizable token airdrop to network supporters and early NFT owners, and has since racked up a number of games that are planned to launch on the network in the months ahead.This includes Crypto Unicorns and BattlePlan, which are migrating from other chains, plus The Media Indie Exchange (The MIX)—a company that works with indie game developers—said that it plans to launch upwards of 100 games on Xai by the end of the year, including a mix of new titles and converted Web2 games."Xai is at the forefront of Web3 gaming and we've been very impressed by their growth in the space over the past several months," said Dimitrios Chatzianagnostou, Head of Investments and Cryptoeconomics at Outlier Ventures. "We're thrilled to partner with Xai to support both Web2 developers looking to start building Web3 games of the future, as well as seasoned Web3 game developers."Editor’s note: This article was written with the assistance of AI.

Nibiru to ‘Overcome Ethereum’s Limitations’ With High-Speed Parallel EVM - Decrypt

Layer 1 blockchain and smart contract ecosystem Nibiru Chain has announced the debut of its native Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) implementation, which aims to advance the design space for developers to build high-performance consumer applications.“Nibiru opens the door for Ethereum-based tokens and applications to benefit from fast transaction processing and further streamlines user experience without the compromises of other scaling solutions,” Nibiru co-founder Unique Divine told Decrypt.Developed by Google, JP Morgan, and Tendermint ex-contributors, the Nibiru EVM “overcomes Ethereum’s limitations,” claiming to deliver speeds of over 10,000 TPS solely on single threaded execution. The Nibiru team aims to further its ability to scale with parallel optimistic execution, which is projected to go live as early as Q3 2024.“Nibiru’s parallel optimistic execution leverages additional cores available to full nodes to process transactions simultaneously, overcoming vital scalability concerns experienced by many blockchain networks,” a spokesperson for the project told Decrypt.Compatible with Ethereum's Solidity programming language, crypto wallet MetaMask and libraries like Ethers.js, Nibiru’s newly added parallel EVM is designed to enable Solidity developers to easily migrate their applications without modifications. The ability for developers to compose both EVM and Wasm smart contracts will overcome a “significant barrier to entry for builders,” said Harvey Liu, Research Engineer at Nibiru.EVM-based applications account for over 90% of on-chain value locked across all smart contract ecosystems. Nibiru’s custom EVM execution “gives developers the ability to build and deploy applications in a familiar environment with a lower barrier to entry,” said a project spokesperson, extending Nibiru’s core Wasm (WebAssembly) functionality with the extensive user base and developer community of Ethereum.By optimizing across multiple layers including “dApp development, scalable blockchain data indexing, consensus optimizations and more,” Nibiru hopes to attract EVM developers from sectors including decentralized finance (DeFi), gaming, NFTs, and real-world assets (RWAs).Slated for mainnet launch in the second half of 2024, Nibiru EVM will come to life in Nibiru v2, publicly released for alpha testing on May 28.For more information, head to Nibiru Chain’s official site, Twitter, GitHub and Community Hub.Daily Debrief NewsletterStart every day with the top news stories right now, plus original features, a podcast, videos and more.

Bitcoin Miner Addresses Dormant for 11 Years Suddenly Transfer $7,000,000 in BTC: On-Chain Data - The Daily Hodl


								A handful of Bitcoin miner addresses that have been dormant for more than 10 years suddenly transferred more than $7 million worth of BTC, according to on-chain data.
The crypto tracker Lookonchain reports that four miner addresses each earned 25 BTC through mining in 2013. After remaining dormant for 11 years, the miners transferred the combined 100 BTC out this week after the top crypto asset crossed $70,000 in price.










BTC is trading at $71,079 at time of writing and is up more than 2% in the past 24 hours.
Lookonchain also notes that a new Coinbase-funded wallet gobbled up a bunch of the Gamestop stock-inspired memecoin GME.
“Someone created a new wallet and spent 12,110 $SOL ($2 million) to buy 135 million GME at $0.0148 in one trade, becoming the 4th holder of GME.
What a crazy buy!”
The Solana (SOL)-based memecoin is trading at $0.00933 at time of writing and is down more than 35% in the past 24 hours but up nearly 130% in the past week.
The real GME on the New York Stock Exchange, the meme stock that exploded in 2021 causing hedge funds to lose large amounts of capital, jumped nearly 50% on Monday, going from $22.91 to $40.08. It has since largely retraced and was priced at $26.50 by the end of the trading day on Tuesday.

Campbell Soup Beats EPS and Revenue Expectations in Fiscal Q3, Ups Guidance - Tokenist


					
Neither the author, Tim Fries, nor this website, The Tokenist, provide financial advice. Please consult our website policy prior to making financial decisions.



Campbell Soup Company (NYSE: CPB) reported robust financial results for the third quarter of fiscal 2024, which ended on April 28, 2024. The company completed its acquisition of Sovos Brands, Inc. on March 12, 2024, which significantly contributed to its performance. Net sales for the quarter were $2.4 billion, representing a 6% increase compared to the same period last year. On an organic basis, net sales remained comparable to the prior year. Over a two-year compound annual growth rate (CAGR), reported net sales increased by 5%, and organic net sales grew by 2%.



Earnings Before Interest and Taxes (EBIT) for the quarter were $248 million, while adjusted EBIT saw a notable increase of 13% to $354 million, reflecting the positive impact of the Sovos Brands acquisition.The company’s Earnings Per Share (EPS) was $0.44, with adjusted EPS rising 10% to $0.75. Campbell’s President and CEO, Mark Clouse, highlighted the sequential volume improvement and stable organic net sales, which, combined with the acquisition, drove double-digit growth in adjusted EBIT and EPS.



The integration of Sovos Brands has already begun to bring significant incremental growth to Campbell, as evidenced by the quarter’s results. The acquisition played a crucial role in the company’s ability to navigate the pace of consumer recovery, contributing positively to both the top and bottom lines.



Campbell Soup Company Beats EPS and Revenue Expectations in Fiscal Q3 



When comparing Campbell’s third-quarter performance against market expectations, the company exceeded analysts’ projections. The expected EPS for the quarter was $0.705, but Campbell reported an adjusted EPS of $0.75, surpassing expectations by 6.4%. 



In terms of revenue, Campbell also exceeded expectations. Analysts had anticipated quarterly revenue of $2.33 billion, but the company reported net sales of $2.4 billion, marking a 3% beat. This increase in net sales was driven by the Sovos Brands acquisition and favorable net price realization despite the challenging market conditions and higher cost inflation.



The company’s gross profit increased from $668 million to $732 million, with an improved gross profit margin of 30.9%, up from 30.0% in the previous year. Adjusted gross profit also increased to $740 million, with an adjusted gross profit margin of 31.2%. 





Campbell Updates Full Year Guidance, Expects EPS in the Range of $3.07 to $3.10



Campbell has updated its full-year fiscal 2024 guidance to reflect the expected performance of its base business and the impact of the Sovos Brands acquisition. The company now expects full-year reported net sales growth to be in the range of 3% to 4%, driven by the incremental impact of the acquisition. Organic net sales growth is tracking to the midpoint of the updated range of approximately 0% to down 1%, reflecting the current pace of consumer recovery.



Campbell’s full-year adjusted EBIT growth for the combined business is expected to be approximately 6.5% to 7%, reflecting the partial year contribution of the acquisition, inclusive of integration savings, as well as base business performance. 



The company also expects full-year adjusted earnings per share growth for the combined business to be approximately 2% to 3%, with EPS projected to be in the range of $3.07 to $3.10, compared to $3.00 in the prior year. This guidance includes expected dilution from the Sovos Brands acquisition of between $0.01 and $0.02 per share. Campbell anticipates building momentum into the fourth quarter, with continued stabilization of year-over-year volume growth and double-digit growth in both fourth-quarter adjusted EBIT and adjusted earnings per share.

US Spot Bitcoin ETFs See Second Highest Daily Net Inflows at $887 Million
This marks the second-highest single-day inflow since these funds listed; The highest record was $1.05 billion on March 12.


The bulk of Tuesday's inflows came from Fidelity's FBTC, which added $379 million. BlackRock's IBIT followed with net inflows of $274 million, according to SoSoValue data.
Overall, cumulative total net inflows for spot Bitcoin ETFs currently stand at $14.85 billion.





Other notable participants include Ark Invest and 21Shares' ARKB, which saw inflows of $139 million, and Bitwise's BITB, which recorded $61 million.

Aave tops $20 billion in deposits amid record revenue and fee switch discussions

Aave community members are pushing for a fee switch proposal after the DeFi protocol’s annualized revenue reached new highs this week.On June 2, Matthew Graham, a member of the Aave liquidity committee, reported that the protocol was “averaging just over $80 million in annual revenue from seven Aave v3 & v2 deployments” across various blockchain networks, including Ethereum.Stani Kulechov, the founder of Aave, corroborated this milestone, stating:“Aave DAO is now earning $115 million annualized. Let that sink in.”This high revenue is not unexpected, considering CryptoSlate recently reported that Aave was one of the few decentralized applications preferred by crypto users over traditional blockchain networks.Consequently, the impressive earnings have reignited community calls for a fee switch proposal. A fee switch allows a platform to toggle specific user fees on or off, potentially redistributing transaction-generated fees to platform participants. Notably, several DeFi protocols, including Uniswap, are contemplating initiating an initiative for their users.Meanwhile, these calls come more than a month after Marc Zeller, founder of the Aave Chain Initiative, suggested that a fee switch proposal was in development. Zeller highlighted that the Aave DAO has a substantial profit margin, providing a financial cushion for the next five years.Deposits cross $20 billion.According to Token Terminal data, the amount of crypto deposited in Aave has exceeded $20 billion, a level not seen since the crash of Terra’s UST algorithmic stablecoin in 2022.Aave Net Deposits (Source: Token Terminal)Market experts said the protocol’s growth shows that the DeFi sector was rapidly recovering from the lows of the 2022 bear market that led to the collapse of several centralized lenders like Celsius, Genesis, and others. Additionally, they said the increased liquidity reflects the growing investor interest in Ethereum, driven by the optimism surrounding the ETH exchange-traded fund (ETF) approvals.According to DeFillama data, Aave is the largest crypto-lending platform in the industry, primarily based on the Ethereum network. The platform recently disclosed plans to introduce several key initiatives, including launching Aave V4, a new visual identity, and expanded DeFi functionalities for its users.Mentioned in this articleLatest Alpha Market Report

FLOKI leads the meme coin market with a 31.99% price increase in 24 hours, showing strong investor interest.



SHIB sees a 9.82% daily price rise despite a slight weekly decline, indicating robust market potential.



BONK experiences a 12.36% price jump, reflecting renewed investor optimism despite recent weekly losses.




FLOKI emerges as the current leader among meme coins, boasting surging trade volume that surpasses even Dogecoin and Shiba Inu.



Trading at $0.0003422, FLOKI logged a staggering $1.094 billion in trading volume over the past day. This impressive performance translates to a 31.99% price increase in the last 24 hours and a 16.21% gain over the past week.

SHIB continues to exhibit positive progress. Currently trading at $0.00002619, SHIB recorded a trading volume of $690 million in the last 24 hours, accompanied by a healthy 9.82% price increase. However, a minor setback is reflected in the previous week’s 8.02% price decline. Despite this, the overall trend suggests a resilient market with potential for further growth.



BONK, another prominent meme coin, exhibits positive momentum. Trading at $0.00003554, BONK logged $582 million in trading volume over the past day, accompanied by a 12.36% price increase. While a 17.19% decline was observed over the past week, recent gains signal renewed investor interest and optimism.



The lively communities and ongoing development efforts surrounding these meme coins are key drivers of their popularity. BONK, in particular, has garnered praise for its strong community values. Additionally, a recent post by Bernard Shelly on X hints at growing excitement around Solhiest’s upcoming technology release, which aims to facilitate a smooth mass transition from Web2 to Web3.













The bullish price action and rising trading volumes observed across these meme coins suggest a potential continuation of the uptrend. Investors are closely following the performance of these coins, with particular focus on FLOKI’s recent surge to all-time highs. The sustained investor interest in SHIB and BONK further underscores the positive market sentiment and the potential for further gains.

Hong Kong Clamps Down Unlicensed Crypto Exchanges


                                Hong Kong Enforces Stricter Measures and Shuts Unlicensed Exchanges                                The Hong Kong authorities have put into effect a new regulation that makes it compulsory for all existing cryptocurrency exchanges in the region to register for an operating license from the Securities and Futures Commission (SFC) or shut down their business. This directive was implemented early this year after the SFC clearly demanded that all the crypto exchanges obtain a license by February 29 or cease operation within the next 90 days.By the deadline, 22 markets requested the licenses that are required for the continuation of the operations in the given region. However, a few of them dropped out before the deadline with their applications. The blockchain journalist Colin Wu stated that six global platforms, with OKX, Gate, and others among them, currently have no CHZ listing. Binance, OKEX, and Huobi, and Huobi HK have stopped their operations in Hong Kong last month. Some of these exchanges did not state the reasons for their decisions, but Gate. HK also said that it was planning an “overhaul” of their trading platform to be in a position to meet the regulatory standards of Hong Kong.Industry Concerns Over New Licensing SystemThere are a number of concerns that industry insiders have raised about the new licensing system. Some critics have argued that it may just be another case of the so-called ‘food truck incident’ or the government’s lacklustre push for virtual banking where much is made but nothing really comes of it.Since June 1, 2020, virtual asset trading platforms (VATPs) in Hong Kong are allowed to operate legally only in case they obtained a license under the Anti-Money Laundering and Anti-Terrorism Financing Order (AMLO). This regulation requires that entities offering VATPs must either be licensed by the Financial Services Council or be considered as deemed licensed entities. The authorities have threatened severe action against non-compliance of the measures, and it is a criminal offence.SFC's Stance and Market ImpactTo be specific, in the official statement, the SFC has disclosed a list of virtual asset trading platform operators, whose license application is still under review. This list also included the deeming to be licensed as on June 1, 2024. The SFC has made it clear that any company which fails to meet its standards will not be granted a license, and this would effectively push platforms out of Hong Kong. These are short-term measures seeking to facilitate the market growth and guarantee investors’ security.Impact on the Crypto IndustryThe impact of this regulatory move on the crypto industry is significant. Firstly, it underscores Hong Kong’s commitment to establishing a regulated and secure environment for cryptocurrency trading, aligning with global standards. This move is expected to bolster investor confidence by ensuring that only compliant and reliable platforms operate in the region. However, it also creates challenges for smaller and newer exchanges that may struggle to meet the stringent requirements, potentially stifling innovation and competition.Market Consolidation and Global InfluenceThe compliance with these regulations can be beneficial to established exchanges that would have faced stiff competition from the new entrants. This could lead to the increased market control and a few large players controlling the market scenario. The exclusion of leading exchanges as OKX, and the absence of giants such as Binance, Coinbase, and Kraken also point out the possible unwillingness of some large players to work under such rigorous legal requirements.The fact that the SFC has made this move might just set a precedent for other jurisdictions that are planning to introduce similar frameworks. It mirrors the current development of governments across the globe coming up with ways of regulating the crypto sector to check on fraudsters and protect investors. Although these measures may disrupt the market in the short term, they could potentially help create a more stable, long-term cryptocurrency market.ConclusionIn conclusion, Hong Kong’s stringent licensing requirements for crypto exchanges represent a significant shift towards a regulated trading environment. While this move aims to enhance investor protection and market integrity, it also poses challenges for smaller players and could lead to market consolidation. The global crypto industry will be watching closely to see how this regulatory framework evolves and its long-term impact on the market.Also Read:- Top 5 Upcoming Crypto Events Not to Miss in 2024

In a remarkable turn of events, Bonk (BONK), a meme coin operating on the Solana blockchain, has captured the market's attention with a substantial surge in its trading volume. According to the latest data, Bonk's 24-hour trading volume has spiked by 64%, reaching a remarkable $701.83 million. This uptick indicates growing interest among traders in this volatile asset.As of now, Bonk is trading at $0.00003435, reflecting a 5.86% increase over the past 24 hours. Over the last 30 days, the BONK price has appreciated by 28.34%, underscoring a sustained bullish momentum that has captured the enthusiasm of the crypto community.Several factors could be contributing to this dramatic rise in Bonk's trading volume and price. The meme coin sector often experiences rapid shifts in sentiment, influenced by social media trends, endorsements and community activities. Positive sentiment around Bonk might be driving its current performance.Active community engagement and ongoing developments within the Bonk ecosystem could also be contributing to the increased trading volume. Meme coins often thrive on strong community support and active developer engagement.BONK gives bullish signalsBonk's technical indicators are reinforcing its bullish trend. The coin is trading above its 100-day Simple Moving Average (SMA) and 100-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA), suggesting prolonged market momentum. These averages provide insight into the coin's longer-term trends, suggesting that BONK has been experiencing consistent buying pressure.Additionally, the Relative Strength Index (RSI) of Bonk stands at 56.97, which falls within the range typically considered to signal bullish conditions. RSI values between 30 and 70 are typically seen as neutral, with values above 70 indicating overbought conditions and values below 30 indicating oversold conditions.Bonk’s RSI indicates that it is neither overbought nor oversold, but rather in a healthy position to continue its upward trajectory. Whether this bullish trend will continue remains to be seen, but for now, the Bonk price is making a notable mark on the market.

Bitcoin trader marks ideal and highest risk entry points to BTC right now


    Bitcoin (BTC) has traded in a tighter price range in the past 18 days, marking key support and resistance levels. These key levels make for ideal and high-risk entry points in Bitcoin, respectively, as the leading cryptocurrency decides its direction.



In a post on X, the prominent Bitcoin and crypto trader who goes by Credible Crypto warns of impending volatility. According to him, BTC is currently at a high-risk entry point, trading near the range’s resistance level. Thus presenting a short-term retracement possibility, targeting the range lows, which corresponds to an ideal entry point at price support.



Moreover, Credible Crypto attributes the incoming volatility to a surging open interest (OI) despite the tight neutral range. Therefore, the trader foresees a short or long squeeze that could cause a deviation and possible breakout from this range.







Although both are viable possibilities, he demonstrated a bullish bias and hoped for a short squeeze to an upwards breakout.

Bitcoin open interest and price analysis



Finbold retrieved data from CoinGlass and TradingView on June 5 that validate the trader’s analysis on Bitcoin.



On the one hand, BTC’s open interest in futures approaches its all-time high, currently at $37.66 billion. It has a record high of $39 billion, which could soon be surpassed by the current surge, highlighting speculative demand.

On the other hand, the BTC/USD daily chart shows a 3-month range between $60,000 and $72,000 with two deviations—one upwards to $73,805 and the other downwards to $56,535. Inside this larger range, the tighter zone Credible Crypto mentioned in his analysis.



In particular, this lower time frame range has the same resistance at $72,000 and higher support at $66,000. The second is what the trader considers an ideal entry point on Bitcoin if it ever happens.

However, Bitcoin registered an all-time low transaction volume, and its spot trading volume faded amid an increased speculative volume on BTC futures and exchange-traded funds (ETFs), as reported by Finbold on June 2.



Like any speculative market, cryptocurrencies present high volatility, especially as uncertainty takes over in finance markets. Thus, investors must look for different analyses and indicators to make better decisions and build their positions accordingly.

SHIB trader who made $120M just bought $18M Shiba Inu


    After making over $120 million trading Shiba Inu (SHIB), one cryptocurrency trader has made another strong bet – this time spending more than $18 million to buy over 700 Shiba Inu in a matter of hours, reflecting increased confidence of SHIB whales in the meme crypto asset’s future.



Specifically, the investor had bought 5.5 trillion SHIB early on for $400,000 and then sold them at two price peaks, profiting $121 million, and now they used 4,849 Ethereum (ETH), worth about $18.44 million, to buy 715.9 billion SHIB, according to the data shared by Lookonchain in an X post on June 5.

Indeed, the crypto trader’s smartly placed purchases and sales, which involved buying SHIB at an average price of roughly $0.0000000727 back in 2021 and then selling at the right moment, amid two significant price peaks, suggest that this investor, in particular, is confident that a price peak will happen again.

It is also worth noting that early Bitcoin (BTC) adopter and professional crypto trader Davinci Jeremie strongly believes in SHIB’s bright future as well, recently sharing his prediction of Shiba Inu rallying and hitting $0.00006 soon, as Finbold reported earlier.



Shiba Inu price analysis



Meanwhile, SHIB was at press time changing hands at the price of $0.00002563, which represents a 7.60% gain in the last 24 hours, as it moves to reverse the 5.13% drop from across the previous seven days and adding up to the 6.26% advance over the past month, as per data on June 5.

Inevitably, the question arises – why is Shiba Inu going up? Notably, one explanation for SHIB’s recent price recovery is the fact that it is happening against the backdrop of a significantly higher number of new accounts on Shiba Inu’s blockchain, Shibarium, soaring by over 3,000% in 24 hours.



All things considered, the largest traders in the crypto market seem to be exceptionally bullish on the future of the currently 11th-largest crypto asset by market capitalization. However, doing one’s own research before investing is critical as other people’s confidence might sometimes be misplaced.

FLOKI explodes to new all-time high; Is new memecoin KangaMoon next? - CoinJournal



                    

                    
Floki price spiked more than 25% to hit a new all-time high.
KangaMoon is a new memecoin project combining GameFi and SocialFi.
Currently available in presale, via a bonus round, the native token KANG is priced at $0.025.

It’s been a fantastic 24 hours for Floki Inu (FLOKI), the memecoin whose growth in the crypto space continues to push it towards the top rankings.
As the altcoin rallies, notable attention is also on new crypto project KangaMoon (KANG). Can this new play-to-earn (P2E) platform’s native token price mirror or even surpass Floki’s?
FLOKI price outlook
Floki, like most of the previous bull cycle memecoin outperformers, has lagged recently launched tokens – mainly PolitiFi and celebrity inspired releases.
However, with industry heavyweights like Ethereum founder Vitalik Buterin expressing concern about the impact of worthless memecoins to crypto, attention remains largely on the likes of Dogecoin, Shiba Inu, Pepe and Floki.
The FLOKI roadmap unveiled in March and recent milestones such as the launch of the Floki trading bot and run to over 417,000 holders on the BNB chain, have helped put this memecoin on track for market dominance.
On Monday, crypto trading and investment firm DWF Labs announced the purchase of $12 million worth of FLOKI tokens. The firm said its goal is to support Floki’s ecosystem growth, which includes such projects such as the upcoming Valhalla metaverse game, credit card and a FLOKI-powered digital bank.
The memecoin hit a new all-time high of $0.0003449 on June 5 after the DWF Labs news. This has analysts taking bullish Floki price predictions.
If FLOKI holds support above the $0.0003 level, it’s likely to strengthen the bullish outlook amid price discovery. 
KangaMoon – the new utility-focused memecoin
KangaMoon (KANG) is a new project that has the market’s attention firmly focused on its upcoming launch and exchange debut. KangaMoon has seen more than $7.6 million raised in its presale.
KANG is the native token of the play-to-earn (P2E) gaming project. It will serve as the utility and governance token, giving holders access to exclusive rewards, rare NFTs and governance participation.
Specifically, users will tap into KANG as an in-game currency for the P2E game and deploy it within the SocialFi ecosystem around it in things like social contests and game puzzles.
KangaMoon price prediction
As the broader market gains amid new upward momentum, memecoins like Floki are likely to stand out. KangaMoon’s KANG is also poised and could ride its ecosystem strength and overall memecoin hype to explode when it launches on exchanges.
KANG price increased from an initial $0.005 in stage 1 of the presale to the current bonus sale price of $0.025. It translates to a noteworthy 400% surge from that initial price.
Binance recently revealed its plans to list small cap projects that have a strong community traction, viable product and transparent team. KangaMoon ticks all these boxes and more. If more tier-1 exchanges list KANG, it’s likely to explode amid demand and visibility.
Notably, the team announced the first CEX to list KANG will be BitMart.

            Crypto startups captured $777 million in investments from venture capital (VC) funds in May, according to data aggregator DefiLlama. This is a 17% slide from the total amount netted in April, and the second consecutive month of VC capital slowing down.Projects focused on building blockchain infrastructure received $630 million last month, representing 81% of the total amount raised in the period. However, this is $100 million less than the total capital flows directed to this sector in May.Farcaster registered the largest infrastructure-related funding round in the period, with $150 million in investments coming from names such as Variant Fund, a16z Crypto, and Paradigm.The Bitcoin (BTC) decentralized finance ecosystem also received attention from VCs, as the BTC staking protocol Babylon secured $70 million from relevant players like HashKey Capital, Polychain Capital, and Galaxy.Despite showing a three-fold growth between March and April, the money directed to decentralized finance (DeFi) startups shrunk to $50 million in May. The largest funding round in DeFi was conducted by Fortunafi, a real-world asset tokenization protocol that received $9.5 million.Notably, the non-fungible token (NFT) sector saw a fresh flow of VC money in May, as utility NFT platform Galaxis got $10 million from Chainlink and four other investors.Web3-focused applications also witnessed growing interest from venture capital funds last month, netting $48 million in funding, a 153% monthly rise. Kiosk, a Farcaster client merging social and blockchain registered the most significant funding round in this sector by capturing $10 million from VCs.Blockchain gaming wraps up the list with nearly $27 million invested, a slight leap from the $24.7 million captured in April. Param Labs received $7 million from VCs such as Animoca Brands, Delphi Digital, and Mechanism Capital.

Crypto Cash Splash: Coinbase, Ripple Shell Out $25 Million Each To Influence Elections


								The crypto industry is stepping up its political game ahead of the upcoming US elections. Leading the charge is Coinbase, the popular US-based crypto exchange, which has donated a whopping $25 million in USDC to the Fairshake Super PAC. This marks Coinbase’s second major contribution to the advocacy group, which aims to promote pro-crypto candidates.

According to Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong, the urgency to support Fairshake’s “stand with crypto” initiative is vital to counter the growing opposition to digital assets among some congressional leaders.
In a recent announcement, Armstrong said:

“The best way to get regulatory clarity in democratic countries is to elect pro-crypto candidates on both sides of the aisle and to vote anti-crypto candidates out of office.”

This latest donation has pushed Fairshake Super PAC’s total funds to an impressive $160 million, showcasing the strong support from various industry giants.
Coinbase, Industry Titans Rally Behind Fairshake
Other notable contributors to Fairshake include cryptocurrency exchanges Kraken and Gemini, venture capital firm Andreessen Horowitz, and investment management firm ARK Invest. These organizations are united in their mission to advocate for a regulatory environment that fosters innovation and growth within the crypto sector. Their collective financial power and influence signify a robust campaign to reshape the political landscape in favor of crypto-friendly policies.

Ripple, another major player in the industry, has contributed a hefty $50 million to Fairshake’s cause. Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse reiterated the firm’s dedication to educating voters about the risks posed by anti-crypto policymakers.




Ripple, along with the broader crypto industry, refuses to stay silent while unelected regulators attempt to stifle innovation and economic growth relied upon by millions of Americans. Garlinghouse said they are committed to this fight and will continue to invest heavily in it until they achieve significant regulatory changes.





However, the crypto industry’s political push is not without its challenges. The substantial donations from Coinbase and other firms might attract regulatory scrutiny, similar to the high-profile case of fallen crypto mogul Sam Bankman-Fried. His political campaign contributions were heavily examined by authorities, setting a precedent that could pose challenges for current industry donors.

As the crypto industry continues to pour funds into political advocacy, it must navigate the complex landscape of campaign finance laws to avoid potential legal troubles. This delicate balance underscores the high stakes involved in their quest for favorable regulation.
Crypto’s Role In The Upcoming Elections
The crypto industry’s vigorous backing of Fairshake Super PAC signals its commitment to combating anti-crypto sentiment among policymakers. With over 900,000 advocates across the United States rallying behind the #StandWithCrypto campaign, the influence of cryptocurrency is poised to be a major factor in the forthcoming elections.

Unlocking Crypto Airdrops: Identify and Prevent Airdrop Scams

“Crypto Airdrops are a good way to reward loyal users and attract new ones,” said Chabgpeng Zhao, the founder and CEO of Binance. “It is similar to having a surprise birthday gift mailed directly to your home.” 
Airdrops in the crypto world are a marketing strategy used by Web3 companies to incentivize their active community or encourage adoption by depositing digital tokens directly into the wallets.
This article explains what airdrops are, how they differ from ICOs and STOs, their potential threats, and how to avoid them simply and easily. Read on and discover one of the most astonishing topics of the crypto world.
What Is Crypto Airdrop?
A crypto airdrop is a promotional initiative by Web3-based companies or startups to encourage adoption or bootstrap their project.
Here, a small amount of virtual currency is deposited directly into the user’s wallet for free or in exchange for small services like retweeting or reposting a post sent by the company announcing airdrops. Airdrops are public campaigns designed to spread awareness about the company’s platform and encourage the adoption of new tokens or coins. 
Promotion of airdrops is generally done on the company’s official website, social media sites like Twitter, Discord, Reddit, or some crypto forums like bitcoin.com. 
Crypto coins or tokens are deposited only to specific wallets depending on the Blockchain network or amount of coin holding. 
To qualify for an airdrop may rely on a particular factor, like the recipient must hold some coins or have to perform specific tasks, such as writing a promotional blog post or Twitter thread, reposting the company’s post about the project, increasing the community base of the network or increasing the impressions and interaction with their project and network.

Are you new to Web3? Here’s a Comprehensive guide to know all about Blockchain forks by Droomdoom.

Types of Crypto Airdrops
Standard Airdrop
No task completion is required to qualify for a standard airdrop; participants just need to express their interest in receiving the airdrop. The individual must sign up with a valid email address. This type of airdrop can be time-sensitive and doled out on an FCFS basis (first come, first serve). 
They may have a limited supply of coins to distribute, limiting how much each person can get. For example, RabbitX has used standard airdrops to roll out their new coin and create a new user base. 

However, they are popular due to their simple method, which makes them vulnerable. It is effortless for an individual to create multiple wallets to drain out airdrop resources. 
Bounty Airdrop
To qualify for bounty airdrops, participants may need to perform specific tasks. Some companies roll out bounty airdrops when they need low-lift promotional work. The tasks assigned could be retweeting, posting a promotional blog post, writing a Twitter thread and tagging the company’s handles, joining their discord channel, or signing up for their newsletter.
Users may need to perform specific tasks to earn points, and using those points, they can participate in airdrop. For example, a user can participate in an airdrop after earning 500 points. Each task is labeled as 100 points like the Foodie NFT platform rolled out nine 9-step to-do lists to become eligible to participate in their $75000 airdrop, including following their social media handles and tagging friends. 
Holder Airdrop
As mentioned in the name ‘holder,’ this airdrop is specifically for those who may hold a certain number of existing tokens or hold existing tokens at all at the time of promotion.
Companies mainly design holder airdrops to incentivize their most loyal and invested users. Some airdrops may only reward users who meet or exceed a threshold amount set by the company. 
One downside is that some holders may not want the airdrop. 
Exclusive Airdrop
According to the name, the exclusive airdrop is explicitly designed for some users who may not have any holding in their wallets. This type of airdrop is not based on how much coin the user holds but on factors like time spent on the project, money spent on non-token activities, and level of engagement on the forum.
For example, Swapping, bridging, or staking the token.
Exclusive airdrop is a more centralized way of rewarding users closest to the project. For example, Uniswap’s airdrop of 400 UNI tokens for its long-standing users, regardless of their holding status.
Raffle Airdrop
Raffle airdrops implement a lottery mechanism. Here, companies may release the number of airdrops they are willing to give and encourage users to earn raffle tickets. Raffle tickets can be achieved by many methods, such as earning points, simply expressing interest, or holding some tokens.
This results in the number of individuals participating exceeding the number of airdrops to be delivered by the company. Therefore, a raffle occurs, and several wallets are selected randomly for the reward. 
For example, gaming platform Revv rewarded $500 to their 100 lucky winners.
Game-Changing Airdrops
Look 
Look is a token NFT trading platform LooksRare on Ethereum issued to increase its user base. Looksrare entered into a genre with tough competition. So, you incentivize people. LooksRare airdropped 12% of LOOKS total supply to anyone with a combined 3 ETH trading Volume or snapshot of the period from January to December. It worked. They captured a large user base within only four months.

Uniswap 
In September 2020, the decentralized protocol UNISWAP airdropped 400 UNI tokens worth $1200. Whoever interacted actively with this decentralized exchange before September 1, 2020, was eligible for the airdrop. Uniswap distributed 150m UNI tokens, with more than half of it going to their team members and investors.

Arbitrum 
On March 16, 2023, Arbitrum announced its airdrop and ARB token, which went live on March 23, 2023. 

New to Cryptocurrency? What are the inevitable cryptocurrency scams that you’re likely to fall for? 

The Arbitrum rewarded users based on their activity on two chain versions, Arbitrum One and Arbitrum Nova. It was based on a point system. The user needed to earn at least three points to become eligible for the airdrop, which could be achieved by performing transactions, liquidating, and bridging funds on Arbitrum. 
More points = More tokens in Airdrop.
70% of the airdrop resources went to team members and investors with equal to or more than four years of investing period.

Airdrops vs. ICOs vs. STOs
Crypto airdrops and Initial Coin offerings may appear the same in front, but they are pretty different. Unlike ICOs, crypto airdrops don’t require any investment. 
ICOs are very similar to IPOs (Initial public offerings) in raising an investment and locking the funds from investors. In ICOs and IPOs, allotment is done through a lottery mechanism. If users are not allocated the token they bid for, funds are returned automatically to their wallets.
ICOs are initially offered to VCs (venture capitalists). Though ICOs require an upfront investment, investors are expected to buy the coin or tokens instead of going for free airdrops. 
The ultimate goal behind Initial Coin offerings and airdrops is entirely different. ICOs are intended to attract investors willing to put their capital into the project. This user base is more likely to see this project as their investment. Alternatively, airdrops are intended to spread awareness among small users.
STOs ( Security Token Offerings) are a method for fundraising in the crypto world. It involves issuing security tokens representing ownership in an investment asset like real estate or equity in a company. 

Learn more ways to spot and avoid Crypto scams, compiled by DroomDroom.

In STOs, the information is recorded for security tokens. However, the main difference is that STOs are saved in the Blockchain and represented by the token. Unlike airdrops or ICOs, STOs are regulated and backed by assets that ensure investor protection. 
Scams and Prevention
Mostly, the ultimate goal of crypto airdrop is promotion. It never seeks capital investment. Some crypto scams involving sending some bitcoins or tokens for winning the airdrops come under dusting scams. 
Airdrops are generally too-good-to-be-true incentives, where it’s easy for users to fall prey to scams. One type of airdrop scam is phishing, which relies on promising users fake airdrops. In phishing scams, users are redirected to third-party websites to input their wallet information to win the phony airdrop. The scam is complete once users connect their wallets using their secret keys or phrases, and their wallet gets drained.

There is another type of airdrop scam called rug pull scam. It can be described through this phrase: “pumping and dumping.” Here, users can be enticed to invest in certain security hacks, buy many specific tokens to increase their demand or get an airdrop. Scammers could liquidate their shares when the token’s value reaches a certain level, thereby dropping its value.
The unwary investors then are left with a token worth nothing.
Or, some people can approach the investor to invest in their project and later run away with all the money without giving any notice.
Conclusion
Crypto airdrops play a significant role in promoting new coins and encouraging adoption in small communities. It can be an excellent way for Crypto enthusiasts to get free tokens and NFTs. However, it’s essential to be cautious and avoid scams. The go-to phrase for every crypto enthusiast in the Crypto world is “Do your own research.”

Bitcoin (BTC) has experienced significant price movement in recent trading sessions, raising both optimism and caution among investors. However, renowned crypto analyst Ali Martinez recently highlighted a potential BTC price correction. He tweeted that the TD Sequential is giving a sell signal on the Bitcoin hourly chart. He anticipated a one-to-four-hour candlestick price correction.Despite this sell signal, Bitcoin remains on a bullish trajectory. According to the latest data, BTC has traded at $70,856, marking a 3.26% increase in the past 24 hours. This upward movement is accompanied by a surge in trading activity, with the 24-hour trading volume up by 28.59%, reaching $37.5 billion. This heightened trading volume indicates strong investor interest and activity on the market.In terms of technical outlook, the Relative Strength Index (RSI) for Bitcoin is currently at 62. The RSI, which measures the magnitude of recent price changes to evaluate overbought or oversold conditions, suggests bullish sentiment as values above 50 typically indicate buying pressure.Similarly, the MACD level for BTC stands at 1182, presenting a buy signal. The MACD is a trend-following momentum indicator that shows the relationship between two moving averages of a security’s price. A positive MACD indicates upward momentum, aligning with the bullish trend observed in Bitcoin’s price movement.Word of cautionDespite the bullish indicators from RSI and MACD, the TD Sequential indicator presents a contrasting perspective. The TD Sequential is a popular tool used to identify potential reversal points on the market. According to Ali Martinez, the indicator has flashed a sell signal on the hourly chart, which could lead to a one-to-four-hour candlestick correction. Overall, current market sentiment for Bitcoin is mixed, with bullish technical indicators on one side and a potential short-term correction on the other. Bitcoin's performance often sets the tone for the broader cryptocurrency market. The recent price increase and trading volume spike reflect growing interest and confidence among investors. However, the looming correction signal suggests that market participants should exercise caution and be prepared for potential volatility.

The official marketing expert of the SHIB developer team, Lucie, has published two posts on her X account, both of which are notable and of major importance. One of them was Lucie’s warning to those crypto community members who continue to show hatred and FUD (“fear, uncertainty, doubt”) against SHIB and Shibarium.She also published an important recap of the key achievements the project has made so far this year.SHIB team's response to hatersLucie issued a tweet, addressing those who keep directing critiques and FUD at the SHIB team and its products. She assured followers that SHIB is “here for the long haul,” and this is not its first encounter with haters. Also, it is likely not the last time either, Lucie expects.In the meantime, the SHIB team member added: “We keep pushing forward, with amazing things happening behind closed doors.” Here she cited Winston S. Churchill who warned once that it is impossible to reach a destination “if you stop and throw stones at every dog that barks.” 2024 recap, with major Shibarium developments publishedIn another recent tweet, Lucie shared a recap of key developments that have been made on or related to layer-2 blockchain solution Shibarium this year so far to send an update to the SHIB community.This update included the progress that has been made on Shibarium as the developers managed to enhance scalability and efficiency within the ecosystem and integrate the Shibdentity initiative “to create a new era of digital identity.”Aside from this, earlier this year, the SHIB team managed to raise an impressive $12 million of funding to support the development of the layer-3 blockchain on top of Shibarium. This chain is designed to be focused on privacy, on improving the speed of transactions and the reduction gas fees. Prior to raising this signifiant sum, SHIB lead Shytoshi Kusama traveled to various locations around the globe to negotiate with potential investors, without revealing it at that time and leaving the community puzzled by his multiple and frequent location changes on X.Among the recent achievement of the SHIB team was participation in the annual Token2049 blockchain conference in Dubai.

Coinbase Debuts Smart Wallet, Gunning to Bring 1 Billion Users to Crypto - Decrypt

We do the research, you get the alpha!Get exclusive reports and access to key insights on airdrops, NFTs, and more! Subscribe now to Alpha Reports and up your game!Go to Alpha ReportsTop U.S. crypto exchange Coinbase today unveiled its promised Smart Wallet, a product it says it designed to reduce hurdles for new users looking to get started in the DeFi space.“Smart Wallets allows users to create a free, secure, self-custody wallet in just a few seconds,” wrote Siddharth Coelho-Prabhu, senior director of product management at Coinbase, in a blog post announcing the release. “They simplify onboarding, reduce the number of transactions to be signed, and seamlessly let you use your Coinbase balances.”Coinbase first announced its Smart Wallet at ETHDenver in February.Instead of traditional recovery phrases, apps, and extensions typically used to access to DeFi apps and services, Smart Wallets make use of industry-standard Passkeys and a companion web portal connecting to the Base, Ethereum, Optimism, Arbitrum, Polygon, Avalanche, BNB, and Zora networks as of launch.Coinbase’s new wallets aim to address challenges to the typical DeFi user experience, especially getting started.“Until now, going onchain has been slow, expensive, and hard, with separate wallet app installs and first-generation blockchains,” Coelho-Prabhu wrote. With Coinbase Smart Wallet, users can create a new wallet using Face ID, a Google Chrome profile, Yubikey, fingerprint unlock feature, or FaceID.Smart Wallets also attempt to correct the fragmentation that occurs when users must manage balances across multiple wallets in order to fully engage with a range of crypto apps. Users will be able to draw from Coinbase account balances or from their self-custodial wallet balance to facilitate transactions almost anywhere.Coinbase is encouraging crypto developers to integrate its Smart Wallet into their apps, offering up to $15,000 in gas credits through a Base Gasless Campaign, and other On-Chain Summer contests and incentives.“Integrating smart wallets are straightforward and only requires at most a few lines of code,” Coelho-Prabhu wrote, noting that the system is live and already supported by popular crypto code libraries.Another notable feature of Smart Wallets is the possibility of gasless transactions through “paymaster” sponsorships, in which developers or other parties can cover user gas fees to provide a product or service for free.All of this, Coelho-Prabhu explained, is part of the company’s broader vision of a world where everyone is using crypto.“Smart wallets are a revolutionary step forward in our mission to bring more than 1 billion users onchain,” he wrote.The Smart Wallet launch kicks off Coinbase’s annual “On-Chain Summer” rewards campaign.Beginning in March, along with the Dencun hard fork and the implementation of “proto danksharding,” the company’s Base layer-2 scaling network for Ethereum has experienced surging total value locked. It has also emerged as the most profitable L2 network with over $6 million in on-chain profits last month.The popular American crypto exchange has faced issues with scaling, however, as Base has grown in popularity in recent months, including multiple instances of transactions failing amid ongoing tension with the SEC.Edited by Ryan Ozawa.Daily Debrief NewsletterStart every day with the top news stories right now, plus original features, a podcast, videos and more.

Why Is The Dogecoin And Shiba Inu Price Rallying Today? | Bitcoinist.com


								Both the Dogecoin and Shiba Inu prices have seen a bullish reversal in the last day, notching notable gains while at it. With no clear development from either camp as to what could be driving the recoveries, a broader market outlook might have the answer to it.
Dogecoin And Shiba Inu Respond To Bitcoin
The current crypto market recovery is being spurred on by the pioneer cryptocurrency, Bitcoin, which is not out of the ordinary. In the last day, Bitcoin has been able to break multiple resistance points and has climbed above $71,000 while at it. This Bitcoin recovery has triggered renewed positive sentiment among crypto investors, spreading out to the likes of Dogecoin and Shiba Inu.

Since the Bitcoin price recovery is the main driver for why the prices of Dogecoin and Shiba Inu are up in the last day, the factors driving the Bitcoin price are ultimately the reason why these meme coins are surging as well. This recovery is, in part, being driven by positive news coming out of the United States.
The latest JOLTS report on the US job markets shows that the market is starting to stabilize once more. Apparently, the job-to-worker ratio has now fallen to a three-year low of 1.2, and the last time it was this low was back in 2021, when the last crypto bull market occurred. This comes as layoff figures drop and quitting rates among employees remain stable.
Investor sentiment has also exploded during this time, with more money flowing into assets such as Bitcoin and Ethereum. According to a CoinShares report, digital asset investment products saw inflows of $185 million in the last week alone, signaling bullish sentiment not just among retail investors but among institutional investors as well. All of these have created a catalyst for the Bitcoin price surge, and altcoins like Shiba Inu and Dogeocin have surged in response.
SHIB Gains Surpass DOGE
Despite both Dogecoin and Shiba Inu seeing gains in the last day, the latter has outperformed the former by a large margin. Dogecoin’s figures came in with 3.7% gains in the 24-hour period, according to data from CoinGecko. This brought its price above $0.16, pushing its market cap to $23.6 billion.

Meanwhile, Shiba Inu has seen double-digit gains, recording a total of 10.2% gains, as CoinGecko data shows. As a result of this recovery, the meme coin has now successfully cleared the $0.000026 resistance, bringing its market cap above $15.4 billion.
However, both top meme coins have fallen behind new investor favorite, FLOKI, which rose more than 24% in the same time period. Other meme coins such as PEPE, BONK, and Dogwifhat have also seen an upside, with 2.7%, 7.9%, and 9.7% gains, respectively.

Tax Preparation for Cryptocurrencies: The Rate Has Been Determined! - Bitcoin Sistemi


According to Habertürk's news, the Ministry of Treasury and Finance plans to impose a transaction tax of 4 per thousand on cryptocurrency investments and 2 per thousand on stock market investments.
While it was stated in the news that it is not planned to introduce a tax such as income tax, it was stated that the cryptocurrency transaction tax will be deducted as a withholding tax when people send money from banks to crypto exchanges to invest in crypto.


It was also stated that the ministry does not plan to collect income tax for now.
Finally, the news included the information that the transaction tax regulation planned to be introduced for crypto and stock market transactions will not be retroactive, that is, it will be valid for transactions made after the regulation comes into force.





As you may remember, Minister of Treasury and Finance Mehmet Şimşek stated at the AK Party's consultation meeting in Kızılcahamam that they were carrying out new studies on the taxation of income obtained from cryptocurrencies and transactions made on crypto exchanges.

Crypto felons SBF and Avi Eisenberg reunited in infamous NY prison


Disgraced FTX founder Sam Bankman-Fried and perpetrator of the 2022 Mango Markets exploit Avraham Eisenberg are once again sharing the same prison. It’s unclear at this stage if the two are ‘bunk buddies.’
Prison records show that Bankman-Fried was returned to the Metropolitan Detention Center (MDC) in Brooklyn on June 4. He was previously held here before being transferred to the Federal Transfer Center in Oklahoma City on May 23. He was then moved to a prison in Pennsylvania on his way back to New York. 
Meanwhile, Eisenberg was moved to the MDC in November while awaiting trial and so shared the prison for some time with Bankman-Fried. Now, following the former FTX chief’s brief tenure in Oklahoma, the pair are back serving time under the same roof.

The Brooklyn prison, which was once described as ‘tougher than Guantánamo Bay,’ has received less than stellar reviews. Indeed, Bankman-Fried’s lawyers described it as having slow internet, dirty living quarters, and a poor cafeteria. The prison also reportedly lacks heating and air conditioning, doesn’t feature a recreational prison yard, and is lit with fluorescent lighting 24/7.
Eisenberg has remained in the MDC since April 18 when he was found guilty of defrauding Mango Markets out of $110 million through the price manipulation of its perpetual futures contracts. Eisenberg is to be sentenced on July 29 where he faces maximum sentences of 10 years and 20 years for his charges. 
Bankman-Fried, who was sentenced to 25 years in April, is currently appealing his conviction. According to Bloomberg, the move back to Brooklyn was likely done to appease Judge Lewis Kaplan who requested that he remain in the city “until his appeal has been fully briefed to facilitate access to appellate counsel.”

Hot take: Your dapp probably isn’t DePIN - Blockworks


Remember the buzz around DAOs in the last crypto cycle? 
Decentralized autonomous organizations were supposed to revolutionize governance. Instead, countless projects misused the term, labeling themselves as DAOs without embodying the core principles of decentralization, autonomy or even functioning as an organization. As the hype grew, the definition became muddled, leaving many investors and enthusiasts with a skewed understanding of what DAOs truly represent.
We’re witnessing a similar trend with DePIN (decentralized physical infrastructure networks). The term has rapidly gained traction, with experts projecting the DePIN market to reach a $1 trillion valuation within the next decade. 
Every day, new projects claim to be part of this transformative wave. But just as with DAOs, many of these projects are misappropriating the label and failing to deliver on the fundamental aspects of DePIN.
DePIN’s emergence and slow burn 
DePIN didn’t emerge overnight. Its roots can be traced back to early decentralized networks like BitTorrent and the Tor network, which demonstrated the power of decentralized systems to distribute data and enhance privacy. These pioneering projects laid the groundwork for what we now recognize as DePIN.
Fast forward to today, and DePIN has evolved into a distinct vertical within the blockchain space. 
Investors are taking note, pouring significant capital into ventures like decentralized wireless networks and storage solutions. For instance, Helium has over 3780,000 active hotspots deployed globally, while the Render Network leverages decentralized GPU power to transform 2D and 3D computer models into lifelike images. As of now, the Render Network has onboarded around 5,600 nodes and completed over 33 million frames rendered.
Call out: Your dapp probably isn’t DePin
To qualify as truly DePIN, the project must be in the business of providing physical infrastructure — and the network formed by that physical infrastructure must be governed purely by the consensus voting of the network’s hardware in a manner that incentivizes network operators for their participation. 
These elements ensure the network operates without central control, utilizes physical assets and fairly rewards contributors.
But there are numerous projects claiming to be part of the DePIN ecosystem without meeting the essential criteria. 
Some of these projects focus on providing off-chain computation or integrating AI services, which, while decentralized, do not involve the creation or management of physical infrastructure. Others within various blockchain ecosystems enhance decentralized computing or offer financial services, but lack the physical infrastructure component necessary for true DePIN projects. 
Read more from our opinion section: Don’t give your life to Big Tech for free
The term DePIN has become a buzzword, and many projects are misusing it to attract attention, despite not adhering to the foundational principles of managing decentralized physical infrastructure. This misuse can mislead investors and stakeholders, diluting the term’s meaning and undermining the integrity of genuine DePIN initiatives. Clear definitions are essential to preserve the promise and potential of DePIN to revolutionize physical infrastructure management.
By understanding and recognizing the core principles that define true DePIN projects — direct linkage to physical infrastructure and governance purely by the consensus voting of the network’s hardware — we can better distinguish between innovative projects and those merely riding the hype wave. 
Understanding what is and isn’t DePIN is vital for the industry’s health and growth.

Vitalik Buterin critiques celebrity memecoin trend, outlines criteria for respectable projects - Crypto Briefing


            
            
                            
            
                            
            
            Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin has expressed his dissatisfaction with the recent surge of celebrity memecoin releases.Buterin argued that the goal of a project should be to provide value to society and leave participants feeling satisfied and happy to have been involved, even if the tokens eventually become worthless.Buterin’s comments came in response to a post discussing the possibility of Iggy Azalea’s MOTHER token becoming the mother of this cycle’s celebrity experimentation if it achieves sustainable value creation. The Ethereum founder argued that financialization is only justified if it serves a purpose that brings value to society, such as improving healthcare, supporting open-source software, and promoting art and creativity.Buterin compared the current celebrity memecoin trend to Ashton Kutcher and Mila Kunis’ Stoner Cats project, which he considered far more respectable. He noted that Stoner Cats funded an actual show, whereas the recent memecoins lack substance and purpose.To earn Buterin’s respect, a celebrity crypto project should have a clear public benefit goal beyond enriching the celebrity and early investors. He also prefers projects with longevity, ideally lasting over 10 years, rather than those that gain temporary popularity for a few months and are then forgotten.Additionally, Buterin believes that a celebrity token should include engaging features beyond simple trading. While he does not favor token-voting decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs), he acknowledged that they at least provide activities and a sense of community for people. However, he stressed that the DAO should not dictate the agenda entirely but should have some degree of influence.The recent weeks have seen a trend of celebrities launching memecoins on Solana, with Iggy Azalea, Caitlyn Jenner, rappers Soulja Boy and Rich The Kid, and adult-content models Kazumi and Ivana Knöll among those who have released tokens. Some celebrities have complained of being scammed by entrepreneur Sahil Arora, who has denied any wrongdoing in the token launches. Azalea stated that her token launch had nothing to do with Arora.

6.52 Billion Dogecoin (DOGE) in 24 Hours Reaches Weekly High

Dogecoin is rapidly gaining traction as whale-tier transactions are on the rise, with 6.52 billion DOGE transacted in the last 24 hours. From a price perspective, Dogecoin is slowly moving in an uptrend, but it does not yet have enough conviction to break the upcoming resistance level of $0.174.Hovering around $0.163 the daily chart of Dogecoin compared to Tether (USDT) shows slow growth from older lows. Moving averages like 50 and 100 are currently moving closer to the price and may act as support levels at any given moment.Data from IntoTheBlock shows significant activity on major transactions. Large transaction volume has varied over the past week, peaking at 1,046 transactions on May 29, 2024, a seven-day period. Though there was a notable decline to a seven-day low of 718 transactions on June 2, 2024, it rebounded to 975 transactions on the final day. This increase in significant transactions indicates that major market participants are becoming more interested. Similarly astounding is the volume of these major deals. The volume reached 6.52 billion DOGE in just the last day and, on May 29, 2024, it reached a seven-day high of 8.65 billion DOGE. June 2, 2024, marked the lowest point at 4.06 billion DOGE. This increase in transaction volume may be a sign of a large holder accumulation phase  which frequently precedes notable price movements. With a weekly peak of $1.44 billion on May 29, 2024, the largest transaction volume in terms of USD value over the last 24 hours was $1.04 billion. On June 2, 2024, it was a volume of $726. Twenty-four million was the lowest ever recorded. When Dogecoin encounters resistance at $0.174, it will take some serious purchasing pressure and ongoing optimism to break this level. Higher price targets and further confirmation of Dogecoin's bullish trend may be possible if it can overcome this resistance.

Coinbase Just Gave Another $25 Million Adding To Their Large Stockpiles Of Campaign Cash In U.S. Elections This Year - Benzinga

Campaign finances play a major role in determining the outcome of every election. Often, candidates with the largest war chests of money can get their message across to the most voters and give themselves a better chance of winning elections. With this in mind, examining where election money flows and from whom is important. Specifically, with crypto seemingly taking a larger role in the upcoming elections in November, it is interesting to see where crypto enthusiasts are placing their money.Don't Miss:Coinbase has been one of the largest crypto donors for the upcoming elections. Along with Ripple and Andreessen Horowitz (a16z), the firm recently added $25 million to the Fairshake political action committee (PAC). In total, the PAC has accumulated over $160 million in funds. The funds are specifically dedicated to finding candidates with pro-crypto stances or candidates who could potentially become pro-crypto in the future. The money is specifically used to buy ads for or against certain candidates and provide other financial support, although the firms aren't allowed to have any direct connections with the campaigns. "When it comes to our mission of increasing economic freedom by growing the adoption of cryptocurrencies, we are deeply engaged in policy efforts. The House and Senate help determine what crypto legislation gets passed, amongst other things, so growing the number of pro-crypto members is critical," Coinbase said in a statement. Trending: If you invested $1000 in DOGE when Elon Musk first tweeted about it in 2019, here’s how much you’d have today.The three companies have donated most of their money to nonpartisan groups, with the remainder evenly split between Democrats and Republicans. Additionally, the firms have donated more than some of the largest financial firms in the world, such as Blackstone, Apollo, and Jane Street.The amount donated is also larger than some major corporate political interests. The three companies have donated more than the entirety of the oil and gas industry and the health care and airline industries combined. Considering how these industries have had in past elections, there is certainly an argument that crypto donations could play a major role in attracting or dissuading voters. Some surveys show that as much as 20% of voters in some swing states see crypto as a key issue in the November election. So, with the elections coming up, it will be interesting to see how the PAC uses its massive amounts of money to influence voters. With crypto seemingly becoming a pressing issue for some, ads and funding could play a role in determining the outcomes for some races. Read Next:

From FUD to ATH: Checking BNB's remarkable recovery to $700 - AMBCrypto



Binance hits different ATHs in the last 24 hours.
BNB has hit the $700 price range.

Binance Coin [BNB] experienced several positive bounces in the last few days, with 4th June’s move pushing its price into a record-breaking range. This new price range has attracted more traders, leading to a surge in Open Interest to its highest level in months.
Binance breaks into new ATH
An analysis of Binance Coin’s price trend shows that it has experienced five consecutive days of uptrends. The most significant increase occurred on 4th June, when BNB saw a 9.53% rise.
The chart showed that the over 9% increase on 4th June took BNB’s price from around $626 to over $680. This price surge marked a new all-time high for BNB, making it the first altcoin to achieve a significant ATH in this cycle after Bitcoin. 
This milestone is particularly notable given the FUD (Fear, Uncertainty, and Doubt) that surrounded it at a point. The FUD started after the US Department of Justice indicted its former CEO, Changpeng Zhao, and the company.
Source: TradingView
As of this writing, Binance (BNB) has reached another all-time high, trading at around $700 after an increase of over 2%. 
The price is now clearly above its short moving average (yellow line) and is in the overbought zone. Analysis of its Relative Strength Index (RSI) indicated it was above 70, signifying a strong bull trend and an overbought state.
Binance’s Open Interest crosses $1 billion
An analysis of Binance’s Open Interest showed a significant reaction to the recent price spike. 
According to a chart on Coinglass, BNB’s Open Interest surged to over $1 billion. The volume of Open Interest is particularly noteworthy as it is the highest level seen over a year. 
This indicates that the price spike triggered a substantial cash inflow into BNB.
Source: Coinglass
The large cash inflow also indicates increased participation from traders on the derivatives side. Most traders are betting on BNB’s price increasing further, which is a bullish signal.
Additionally, the chart on Coinglass showed that short position traders have suffered significant losses in the last 24 hours with the recent price spike. 
The chart revealed that the volume of liquidations for short positions was over $6 million, while the volume for long positions was less than $300,000.
Volume hits highest points in over a month
An analysis of Binance’s volume showed significant momentum in the past few days. In the last 24 hours, the volume has reached levels not seen in over a month.

Read Binance (BNB) Price Prediction 2024-25

As of this writing, the volume was over $4 billion, with the last significant increase occurring in April. 
This rise in volume indicates heightened activity in the spot trading market, which could drive the price higher.

Analyst’s Insight on How Court Ruling Failed to Propel XRP Price


							

XRP’s legal clarity as a non-security has yet to translate to price growth, contrasting Ethereum’s performance.



Ripple’s CEO hints at XRP potentially surpassing Ethereum again if regulatory dynamics shift favorably.



Garlinghouse advocates for XRP ETFs, predicting their inevitable approval, citing investor demand for diversified exposure.




Bill Morgan, a digital asset enthusiast, highlighted a crucial aspect of XRP’s legal journey. He noted that XRP, unlike many other cryptocurrencies, obtained a court ruling declaring the token as not a security. Despite this positive legal development, XRP’s price remains relatively stagnant, hovering just above its value 11 months earlier.. 







This stagnation persists even as the broader crypto market has shown considerable growth. Morgan’s commentary highlights the complexities behind XRP’s market performance compared to Ethereum.



As reported by Zach Rector, an X user, Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse emphasized that XRP had surpassed Ethereum in the past before the latter received a more favorable stance from the SEC. He speculated on the potential of XRP to outpace Ethereum once more if regulatory dynamics shift in its favor. 







Garlinghouse also advocated for creating multiple altcoin Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs). He argued that investors seek diversified exposure, similar to holding both gold and silver, rather than a single asset. According to Garlinghouse, the approval of an XRP ETF is inevitable.



XRP’s price is $0.526985, with a 24-hour trading volume of $1,304,910,529. This represents a 1.10% increase in the last 24 hours, bringing its market cap to $29,221,492,105. The circulating supply of XRP is 55,450,358,947 coins, with a maximum supply capped at 100 billion coins. 









In contrast, Ethereum is priced at $3,794.85, up 1.28% over the last 24 hours, with a trading volume of $14.654B. Ethereum’s market cap is significantly higher at $455.944B, with a circulating supply of 120.148M ETH coins.



The divergence in price performance between XRP and Ethereum can be attributed to several factors. Having received a clearer regulatory stance, Ethereum enjoys a more favorable position. This regulatory clarity likely contributes to its superior market performance.

Bitcoin tapping $72K could be the fuse for a new all-time high, says analyst


    Bitcoin (BTC)  registered its highest jump in the past two weeks at $71,000, falling just short of its all-time high.



Analysts predict that reaching the critical $72,000 mark could act as a fuse, igniting mass liquidations and setting new records.



Crypto analyst Willy Woo highlighted insights from the Bitcoin Liquidation Heatmap in a recent post on X (formerly Twitter). He noted a potential $1.5 billion Bitcoin short liquidation if BTC hits the crucial $72,000 mark. 








“Tapping $72k is the fuse set to start a liquidation cascade. $1.5b of short positions ready to be liquidated all the way up to $75k and a new all-time high,” Woo stated.

According to CoinGlass, a potential move above $72,500 would trigger the liquidation of over $1.2 billion worth of leveraged short positions. 



Supporting analysis from Rekt Capital



Trader Rekt Capital’s analysis further supports Willy Woo’s insights. In a recent post, Rekt Capital noted that Bitcoin broke out of a significant two-week downtrend. He pointed out that while Bitcoin spiked past $70,000, it needs to close above resistance to confirm the breakout.



He also suggested that, based on historical patterns, Bitcoin might consolidate between $68,000 and $71,500  before entering an upward parabolic movement phase.



This anticipated consolidation phase aligns with Woo’s prediction that hitting the $72,000 level would trigger substantial liquidations, paving the way for new all-time highs.



Current Bitcoin price and market trends



Currently, Bitcoin is priced at $70,765, with a 24-hour trading volume of $37.6 billion. Despite recent volatility, Bitcoin has surged by 2.85% in the past 24 hours, indicating a significant recovery.

Technical indicators paint a bullish picture for Bitcoin. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) sits at 62, indicating strong buying pressure, and the positive MACD level at 1182 suggests upward momentum.



Meanwhile, open interest in Bitcoin has surged by 5%, reaching a valuation of $37.5 billion.



However, a contrasting signal emerges from the TD Sequential, which has flashed a sell signal on the hourly chart, hinting at a potential short-term price correction.



While the overall sentiment leans bullish, this highlights the importance of exercising caution and considering other factors before making investment decisions in Bitcoin’s volatile market.

Shiba Inu (SHIB) at Risk of Decline Despite Whale Activity


The last month has been marked by an uptick in Shiba Inu (SHIB) whale activity. However, this was not reflected in the price of the leading meme coin during that period.
Exchanging hands at $0.000025 at press time, SHIB’s value rallied to a peak of $0.000028 on May 29 and has since declined by almost 10%. 
Shiba Inu Whales Fail to Move the Needle
In the last month, there has been a surge in the daily count of large SHIB transactions.  

The number of transactions worth between $100,000 and $1 million has increased by 238% in the last 30 days, and the number of larger transactions valued between $1 million and $10 million has also increased by 50% during the same period.
Shiba Inu Whale Activity. Source: IntoTheBlock
A rise in whale transaction counts suggests that large investors are becoming more interested in the asset. This may be due to a number of reasons varying from the asset’s positive price performance to the overall market outlook.
In SHIB’s case, the surge in the meme coin’s whale activity is attributable to the growth witnessed in the general meme market in May. 
However, while this growth caused other meme assets such as Pepe (PEPE), dogwifhat (WIF), and Floki (FLOKI) to witness significant spikes in their values, the low demand for SHIB put downward pressure on its price.

Shiba Inu Network Activity. Source: IntoTheBlock
Still low at press time, the count of SHIB’s active and new addresses has plummeted by 13% and 9% in the past seven days.  When the demand for an asset craters in this manner, it confirms that the market trend has shifted from positive to negative. 
SHIB Price Prediction: Brace For a Price Drop?
The dots that comprise SHIB’s Parabolic Stop and Reverse (SAR) indicator are above its price at press time. 
This indicator identifies an asset’s potential trend direction and price reversals. When its dots lie above the price, it is a bearish sign. It suggests that the market is declining, and the asset’s price may continue to fall. 
Also, readings from SHIB’s Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) indicator revealed an upward intersection of the signal line (red) with the MACD line (blue) on June 2. This crossover is a bearish signal, which suggests that SHIB’s short-term average has fallen below its long-term average. 

Traders view it as a sign to exit long and open short positions.

If this trend is sustained and market participants continue to close out their long positions, SHIB’s price may dip to $0.000023.

However, if this is invalidated, the meme coin might exchange hands at $0.000026.

Bitwise CIO Predicts Crypto Catalyst Bigger Than Blackrock


								Bitwise Chief Investment Officer Matt Hougan released a compelling investor memo titled “Washington Awakens: This Is What Alpha Looks Like,” predicting a monumental shift in the crypto market influenced by changing regulatory landscapes, potentially surpassing the impact of BlackRock’s foray into Bitcoin and altcoins.
This Crypto Development Is Bigger Than BlackRock
In his memo, Hougan outlines the significant, yet underappreciated shifts in Washington D.C.’s attitude towards digital assets. “Few outside the crypto bubble seem to notice Washington’s evolving attitude toward crypto. That could spell alpha,” Hougan writes, pointing to the recent bipartisan movements in US legislation that signal a warming stance towards digital assets.
Alpha signifies an investment strategy’s ability to outperform the market, often reflecting an edge or advanced insight. Hougan, leveraging his experience managing the world’s largest crypto index fund, argues that understanding nuances in regulatory changes could be the key to unlocking such alpha.

The memo details recent legislative actions, such as the House vote on May 8, where 21 Democrats sided with Republicans to repeal SEC’s SAB 121, a regulation that hinders large banks from handling digital assets. Additionally, on May 20, a notable 71 Democrats joined 208 Republicans to support FIT21, a comprehensive bill favoring oversight by the crypto-friendly Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC).
These actions, however, face challenges, highlighted by President Biden’s recent veto of the SAB 121 repeal, marking a setback in the legislative process. Despite this, Hougan remains optimistic about the evolving political climate. “We’ve been sailing upwind for a decade in crypto. Finally, the winds have started to change,” he states.
Hougan’s memo also underscores the significant surprise approval by the SEC, under Chair Gary Gensler, to list spot Ethereum ETFs—a move few expected this spring, which reflects a gradual but meaningful shift in regulatory stance towards digital assets.

Highlighting the disconnect between Washington’s actions and public perception, Hougan comments, “I’ve been on the road speaking at conferences […] and, try though I might, I cannot get this story to resonate with people.” He suggests that the complexity of the situation and the indirect impact of these changes have kept them from catching the public’s eye.
Yet, the potential for substantial market movement is immense. Hougan illustrates, “Imagine, then, how much of that $20 trillion will go into crypto when the biggest barrier gets lifted.” He refers to the long-standing issue of regulatory uncertainty, consistently cited as the main hurdle by US financial advisors wary of increasing Bitcoin and crypto holdings.
Comparing the potential market movement to the entry of BlackRock into the space, Hougan posits that a full acceptance by Wall Street could dwarf the effects seen from BlackRock’s involvement. “If you think BlackRock’s move into the crypto space positively impacted the market, imagine if all of Wall Street accepted crypto as a normal part of the market,” he elaborates.
Concluding his memo, Hougan hints at a bullish future, “The market will wake up to the fact that we are in a new era for crypto, and when it does, I suspect it will move the industry towards all-time highs.” However, he notes, “But until it does, there may just be some alpha laying around.”
At press time, Bitcoin traded at $71,018.

Bitcoin Like A Spring Waiting To Uncoil, Analyst Explains Why


																An on-chain analyst has explained how Bitcoin is sitting like a coiled spring right now, a state the asset doesn’t usually stay in for too long.
Bitcoin Short-Term Holder Sell-Side Risk Ratio Has Declined Recently
In a new post on X, analyst Checkmate has discussed the recent trend occurring in the Sell-Side Risk Ratio for the Bitcoin short-term holders. The Sell-Side Risk Ratio here refers to an indicator that tells us about how the absolute profit and loss being locked in by the investors compares against the BTC Realized Cap.
The Realized Cap is basically a measure of the total amount of capital that holders as a whole have used to purchase their coins, as determined by on-chain data.

	Related Reading


Thus, the Sell-Side Risk Ratio, which takes the ratio between the sum of profit and loss with this initial investment, provides info about how the profit or loss-taking from the investors looks like relative to their cost basis. When the value of the indicator is high, it means the holders are realizing a large profit or loss right now. Such a trend may follow some sharp volatility in the asset’s price.
On the other hand, the metric being low implies that investors are only selling coins close to their break-even level. This kind of trend could suggest profit or loss-takers in the market have become exhausted.
In the context of the current topic, the entire market’s Sell-Side Risk Ratio isn’t of interest, but rather that of only a specific segment of it: the short-term holders (STHs). These investors are typically defined as those who acquired their coins within the past 155 days.
The below chart shows the trend in the metric for this cohort over the past decade:
The value of the indicator appears to have been going down over the last few months | Source: @_Checkmatey_ on X
As is visible in the graph, the Sell-Side Risk Ratio for the Bitcoin STHs had shot up to a very high level when the rally towards the new all-time high (ATH) had occurred earlier in the year. Historically, the STHs have shown to be the fickle-minded hands of the market, who sell easily at the sight of any FOMO or FUD in the sector. As such, it’s not surprising to see that these investors had ramped up their profit realization alongside the rally.

	Related Reading


Since this peak, though, the indicator has gone through a steep decline as the price of the cryptocurrency has been stuck in endless consolidation. Following the drawdown, the metric has now returned to relatively low levels.
It would appear that as the tight sideways movement has occurred, sellers among the STHs have seen exhaustion. “Bitcoin is coiled like a spring, and it usually doesn’t sit still like this for long,” notes the analyst. With the asset’s price surging to $71,000 in the past day, it’s possible that this unwinding may already be here.
BTC Price
Bitcoin has enjoyed an increase of around 3% in the past 24 hours, which has now taken its price to $70,900.

Floki Price At New All-Time High, Is PlayDoge The Next Meme Crypto To Explode?


This article was paid for*
The Floki price reached a new all-time high during the Asian trading hours today on Wednesday. 
The meme coin traded as high as $0.000344 after rallying by 30% in the past 24 hours, notching a $3.3 billion peak valuation. It is witnessing a marginal pullback since, trading at $0.00033 at press time. 

However, experts are in consensus that the Floki coin still has enormous price potential.
Floki Inu’s success has also shined a spotlight on the play-to-earn sector due to its popular NFT Metaverse game, Valhalla. Now, PlayDoge – another dog-themed token with play-to-earn utility – is garnering strong support during its presale. 
A few experts are even calling $PLAY the next 100x meme coin. 
Floki Price Hits New ATH, Draws Comparisons With Pepe Coin
The Floki price has appreciated by over 70% during the past month to reach a new all-time high today. However, the meme coin remains poised to maintain its bullish trajectory in the coming weeks. 
Experts have long been drawing similarities between the Floki and Pepe price charts. 
Analyst Kaleo (@CryptoKaleo) reveals that Floki’s price action looks a lot like Pepe coin, especially in the lower time frames. 

He further emphasizes that once PEPE entered price discovery after reaching a new all-time high, it sustained its bullish momentum. This serves as a clear indicator for Floki to maintain its upward trajectory as well and not capitulate to profit-taking. 

With Floki teasing a major announcement on June 10th and DWF Labs purchasing $12 million worth of $FLOKI tokens, the meme coin’s short-term price prospects could not be more bullish. 
Floki Long-Term Price Prediction – How High Can The Meme Coin Go?
Despite the Floki price reaching a new all-time high, it remains an excellent investment for the long term. 
The aforementioned trader Kaleo highlights that the Floki crypto has created a bullish cup and handle pattern in the higher time frames and could skyrocket to a $10 billion valuation in the coming weeks. 

Experts are also highlighting Floki’s strong correlation with BNB, which has been one of the most bullish large-cap altcoins during this cycle. BNB also hit a new all-time high today during the Asian trading hours. 

Just as Pepe acts as leveraged ETH, experts project Floki to act like leveraged BNB. As such, it is the leading meme coin on the BNB Smart Chain. Recently, the token surpassed over 417,000 holders on the BNB chain. 

Finally, Floki Inu’s strong fundamentals is one of the key factors behind investors’ long-term optimism. 
For instance, the Floki staking program has a TVL of over $750 million, while the FlokiFi Locker has another $125 million staked in it. 
Similarly, the meme coin recently announced the beta launch of its new Trading Bot, which has a ‘buy-and-burn mechanism’ that is expected to create a deflationary token supply and boost the Floki price. 
Experts are also highlighting that some of the project’s best initiatives – including the Valhalla play-to-earn game and the trading bot – are still not live on the mainnet. 

Consequently, Floki has several bullish narratives ahead of it to sustain a bull rally to over $10 billion market cap. 
Could PlayDoge Be The Next Floki?
With Floki hitting a new all-time high, investors are now searching for the next big meme coin that could replicate its success. Owing to several striking similarities, experts are already eyeing PlayDoge ($PLAY) as the next Floki.

VIDEO

For starters, $PLAY is native to the BNB Smart Chain and could show a strong correlation to the BNB token. The new meme coin is also live on Ethereum, facilitating broader adoption during its ongoing presale. 
Furthermore, PlayDoge is also a play-to-earn meme coin. Much like Floki’s Valhalla, the classic Tamagotchi-styled PlayDoge game is already seeing excitement from gamers, even before its launch. 
The game allows players to own their own Doge as a digital pet. Consider it a modern twist on Tamagotchi – players can feed, play and train their pet through a smartphone application, with an added incentive of earning free crypto. 
Indeed, players can complete a series of classic 2D games and earn $PLAY tokens and experience points as a reward. Leaders with the most XP will also receive an additional bonus. 
This combination of Doge’s popularity and Tamagotchi’s nostalgia has resulted in much hype about PlayDoge’s upcoming launch. 
Finally, PlayDoge has its own staking protocol, similar to Floki. According to the token’s staking dashboard, it is currently offering an APY of over 120%. 
Owing to its unique value proposition, it’s no surprise that the PlayDoge presale has already raised over $2.2 million in just over a week. 

Interested buyers can still purchase the token by visiting the playdoge.io website.

The Mysterious Whale Who Made $400 Thousand to $145 Million in the Bull of 2021 Has Been Buying Again! Here's the Altcoin That Bull Chose! - Bitcoin Sistemi

While many memetokens, especially Solana (SOL)-based memetokens, have been very popular among investors since the beginning of 2024, memetokens such as FLOKI and SHIB, which came to the fore in the bull rally in 2021, also took their place in portfolios.
At this point, the corporate whale, who was a former SHIB investor and previously earned $145 million, started collecting SHIB again.


According to Spot on Chain's post, the corporate whale, which started buying SHIB again two years later, bought 715.8B SHIB in exchange for 4,849 WETH worth $18.5 million.
This whale had previously spent only $400,000 to purchase 5.5T SHIBs and later sold these SHIBs for approximately $145 million.





Pointing out that this whale still has 9,207 Ethreum (ETH) and WETH worth $ 34.9 million, Spot on Chain stated that this investor is likely to buy more SHIB.
While this investor's large purchase of SHIB had a positive impact on the price, the SHIB price increased by around 8% in the last 24 hours.



“The early institutional investor, who made a profit of $145 million from SHIB, buys SHIB again 2 years later!
In the last 5 hours, the organization increased the price by exchanging 4,849 WETH (worth $18.5 million) for 715.8B SHIB.
The organization still holds 9,207 ETH and WETH ($34.9 million) and may continue to acquire more SHIB!
This organization had previously received 8.29T SHIB between February 2021 and June 2022.
Most SHIBs were purchased very early in early March 2021, while the remaining SHIBs were sold during the biggest pump in October-November 2021.
This investment yielded an estimated total profit of $145 million (+5.201%)!”

SHIB continues to trade at $0.0000257 at the time of writing.

Tether CEO Paolo Ardoino Issues Crucial Warning Amid Major Vendor Breach


Tether CEO Paolo Ardoino has raised concerns following reports of a potential security breach affecting a vendor used by many cryptocurrency companies. While not naming the vendor, it was later revealed to be CoinGecko, a popular platform for cryptocurrency data.CoinGecko's COO and cofounder acknowledged the breach and warned of phishing attempts through fraudulent email blasts promoting fake token launches. This has prompted worries within the cryptocurrency community, potentially putting several companies at risk of phishing attacks. CoinGecko assured users it is investigating the incident and clarified it has no plans for its own token. The vendor's official X account later alerted users to a phishing attempt involving a fake token airdrop, clarifying that neither CoinGecko nor its subsidiary, GeckoTerminal, endorse any officially issued coins or tokens. The company apologized for any confusion and promised to prioritize platform security during its investigation.According to the latest report by Chainalysis, there was a significant decrease in crypto-related phishing scams in 2023. Compared to 2022, scam revenue dropped by 29.2%. This can be attributed to increased awareness within the crypto community and improved security measures by crypto platforms. However, the CoinGecko incident highlights the ongoing threat of phishing attacks, and users should remain vigilant against suspicious emails and fraudulent token promotions.

Michael Saylor, cofounder of MicroStrategy business intelligence giant and a prominent Bitcoin evangelist, continues a series of BTC-themed tweets that he has been publishing daily. His recent tweet coincided with the world’s leading digital currency reclaiming the much-anticipated $71,000 price level.In an earlier tweet, however, Saylor made a Bitcoin-related prediction about the future of money. Michael Saylor's statement as Bitcoin price jumpsIn a recent tweet, Saylor published an AI-generated photo of a bee inside a beehive with a Bitcoin mascot inside it. “Join the Swarm,” the tweet invites, meaning the rapidly growing global community of BTC believers and holders.His earlier tweet, though, contains a prediction of the future form of money. Saylor tweeted that he expects the future of money to be digital, concluding the tweet with a Bitcoin hashtag. Bitcoin surged above the $71,240 level yesterday and then again recovered it today after a small rebound, as market participants look forward to potential interest rate cuts by the U.S. Federal Reserve as early as November. The Bitcoin price increase from Tuesday to today constituted 3.71%. The decline since then has been almost 0.9%, with Bitcoin changing hands at $70,680.Aside from that, on Tuesday, spot Bitcoin ETFs saw massive inflows as they absorbed a whopping $887 million in BTC. BlackRock’s IBIT scooped up $274 million, while Ark Invest increased its BTC holdings by $139 million. This happened to be the second largest daily inflow since the Bitcoin ETF approval by the SEC in mid-January.Bitcoin to surpass gold 3x, Max Keiser expectsIn a recent tweet, major Bitcoin supporter Max Keiser shared a take on the future Bitcoin price surge. Citing a tweet by user “Bitcoin Archive,” Keiser said that he expects Bitcoin to surpass gold in terms of market capitalization value at least 2x, but maybe even 3x.This prediction was based on a recent statement that VanEck chief executive Jan van Eck made during his talk with crypto trader and podcaster Scott Melker. Van Eck believes that Bitcoin's market cap will be worth at least half of gold’s market capitalization. Gold’s market cap currently comprises roughly $15.9 trillion, and Bitcoin’s market cap stands at $1.4 trillion, which is approximately 10x smaller at the moment.

Bitcoin is above $71,000 as investors keep pouring into the spot Bitcoin ETFs

Investors are continuing to pour into spot Bitcoin ETFs, making Wednesday the best day since March, with the top cryptocurrency Bitcoin trading above $71,000 in the morning hours.GameStop stock is a sell and 'Roaring Kitty' should get out now, says strategistAccording to Bitcoin ETF tracker Farside, the spot Bitcoin ETFs saw over $880 million in inflows on Tuesday. Fidelity’s FBTC saw $378 million in inflows, the highest among all spot Bitcoin ETFs, followed by BlackRock’s IBIT, which saw a $270 million inflow. Grayscale’s GBTC, which has a history of seeing outflows, also attracted investors with $28 million.The spot Bitcoin ETFs were approved in January by the SEC, and it has since been boosting and revitalizing the crypto market. Following that, the U.K.’s finance watchdog allowed investment exchanges to list crypto-linked exchange-traded notes (or ETNs). Recently, Hong Kong gave the green signal to Bitcoin ETFs, and earlier this week, Australia got its first Bitcoin ETF. Moreover, the SEC gave the go-ahead to eight spot Ether ETFs last month in its landmark decision. As a result of the authorities’ approval, investor confidence has risen, causing a boom in the crypto market.Neil Roarty, an analyst at the investment platform Stocklytics, said in an email that institutional investors will remain bullish on Bitcoin if interest rates also decrease. “If we see [interest rate] cuts sooner rather than later, the strong returns Bitcoin has been delivering lately could look even more appealing versus more traditional - and perhaps safer - investments,” he said. “As always seems to be the case with Bitcoin, the only guarantee is that we’re in for an unpredictable ride.”The bullish sentiment spread across the crypto market on Wednesday morning, with the second-largest cryptocurrency, Ether, hovering around $3,800. Solana’s price jumped 3.5%, trading around $172, while Dogecoin was up nearly 2%, trading at $0.16. Overall, the global crypto market was up nearly 3%, at $2.63 trillion, according to CoinMarketCap.

Surprising Post from Ethereum (ETH) Founder Vitalik Buterin: He Mentioned a Surprise Altcoin! "I am not satisfied!" - Bitcoin Sistemi

A new post came from Ethereum (ETH) co-founder Vitalik Buterin, who has recently positively affected the price of the altcoin with his altcoin shares and statements.
Commenting on a memecoin this time, Buterin drew attention to the altcoin called MOTHER.


Responding to former Ark Invest analyst Chris Burniske's post, Buterin stated that he was not satisfied with the altcoins issued by celebrities through the memecoin called MOTHER.
In his post a few days ago, Burniske said that if MOTHER, the memecoin released by Hip-hop artist Iggy Azalea, can gain a sustainable value, this bull cycle will be the mother of famous memecoins.





Commenting on this post, Vitalik Buterin said that he is quite unhappy with the famous memecoins of this bull cycle so far.
Stating that these altcoins only enrich celebrities and early stage investors, Buterin listed the features that these altcoins should have in order for celebrities to be more willing to respect the altcoins issued by them:



“It has to have some sort of public good purpose that it serves, other than enriching celebrities and early adopters.
Realistically, it should either be an art project, benefit a celebrity's favorite charity, or both.
2. Have fun mechanics that go beyond just trading tokens. While I don't like token voting DAOs, at least they give people something to do and organize. The DAO shouldn't completely decide the agenda, but it can have some influence.
3. It should be a project that will last more than 10 years, rather than sitting around for a few months and then being forgotten. So it must have solid foundations.”

MOTHER, which has experienced an increase of more than 17% in the last 24 hours, continues to be traded at $ 0.112 at the time of writing.

DMM Bitcoin lays out fundraising plan to repay theft victims - Blockworks


A Japanese crypto exchange plans to pay back victims of a recent unauthorized leak in the coming days via raising capital.
DMM Bitcoin reiterated in a translated post that it would make available the entire amount of customer-held bitcoin lost in the leak “with support from our group companies.”
The company took out a loan worth $32 million, or five billion yen, on Monday. 
Read more: Japanese crypto exchange reports bitcoin theft worth $305M
DMM Bitcoin noted it planned to raise $310 million (48 billion yen) on June 7. It then seeks to secure an additional roughly $13 million (two billion yen) in subordinated debt on June 10.
The update comes about a week after DMM Bitcoin revealed 4,502.9 BTC — worth $305.1 million at the time — was stolen. After the theft took place on May 31 at 12:26 am ET (1:26 pm JST), the company stopped processing crypto withdrawals, spot market purchase orders and new leveraged trading positions.
DMM Bitcoin quickly said customer bitcoin deposits would be fully guaranteed — a promise the company has now repeated in its latest post. 
The crypto exchange intends to release a report with more details about the leak when it has them.
“We will continue to procure [b]itcoin equivalent to the amount leaked, taking care not to impact the market,” the company wrote. “We are currently continuing to conduct an investigation to determine the cause of the unauthorized leak.”

Donald Trump's Crypto Stash Swells To $31M Thanks To 'Trump Frog' TROG Airdrop - Benzinga

Former President Donald Trump's crypto portfolio is boosted by the airdrop of a new meme coin crossing over Trump and frog memes.What Happened: Arkham Intelligence data shows Donald Trump's meme coin holdings surging to over $30 million. The former president was airdropped half of the Trog TROG/USD supply by the developer team a few days ago. This airdrop has now been factored in by Arkham, with a market worth of around $19 million.Arkham noted that holding such a significant portion of the supply (210.3 billion), it is improbable that Trump could sell it at market value, even if he is aware of its existence.Trump’s portfolio value stands at $30.3 million, more than doubling from the $13 million only a week prior.Maga Memecoin TRUMP/USD, Ethereum ETH/USD and WETH WETH/USD are the next three top holdings in Trump's portfolio.Also Read: Survey: Crypto Stance Could Sway One-Third Of 2024 VotersWhy It Matters: Arkham's post raises questions about the liquidity of such assets and the challenges in converting them to cash. This development could also influence the market perception and value of TROG, given Trump’s high-profile status.In a tweet, popular crypto trader Zoomer Oracle ironically mused how the media may have to report TROG being the biggest donator of Trump’s campaign. Another trader reported a six-figure gain in only four days trading the meme coin.TROG bills itself as a combination of the "meme-worthy charm of a frog with the unmistakable flair of Trump."The symbol is a frog with the hat of ‘MAGA'. Its developers call Trog not just a coin but a movement. "A green wave of fun, financial potential, and of course, a good dose of meme magic."According to DEXScreener data, TROG started trading on June 1, and is up 130% over the past 24 hours to trade around a $38 million valuation.What’s Next: The influence of meme coins and Bitcoin as an institutional asset class is expected to be thoroughly explored at Benzinga’s upcoming Future of Digital Assets event on Nov. 19.Read Next: Donald Trump’s Crypto Wallet Grows By $500K In Value Following TrialImage created using artificial intelligence with Midjourney.

Whales signal: Large investors are selling this trending RWA cryptocurrency


    Chainlink (LINK) has been trending year-over-year, fueled by the real-world assets (RWA) narrative, attracting retail investors and increasing in price. Meanwhile, Chainlink whales have apparently been decreasing their exposure to the token, likely selling their large holdings over time.



Finbold retrieved this whale signal through premium data from Santiment, tracking the U.S. dollar value from Chainlink whales. Essentially, the metric considers a whale any address holding over $2 million in sight of LINK’s $10 billion market cap.



As observed, these holdings have dropped from $550.56 million on June 4, 2023, to $464.65 million by press time. Notably, LINK was trading at $6.07 one year ago, more than doubling in price currently at $17.6. This highlights an even higher drop in whales’ holdings measured in LINK, raising a relevant signal to the cryptocurrency market.







In contrast, Ethereum (ETH) whale balances have increased throughout these 12 months, following the year-over-year price trend.

Chainlink trending with the real-world assets narrative



The real-world assets narrative was fueled by BlackRock’s (NYSE: BLK) growing interest in the tokenization of RWA. Interestingly, Larry Fink, CEO at BlackRock, mentioned he sees great value in tokenization, and the company is backing an investment fund within this asset class.



Chainlink benefits from this trend due to its leading Oracle solution, which gathers real-world off-chain data and broadcasts it on-chain.



However, the token LINK does not have a clear demand for the people interacting with the chain. Their most known utility is rewarding the Oracle node operators, which generates supply pressure but no market demand besides speculation.



So far, the speculative demand has kept the token’s value, but whales’ activity may signal it is not sustainable long-term. Recently, Chainlink was trending on Reddit with 545 mentions in 24 hours—highlighting retail’s interest in speculating on LINK.



Trending cryptocurrencies on Reddit. Source: Finbold



With the lack of a clear demand, hype, and social media buzz is what drive LINK’s price action. Traders who buy this token are essentially gambling in the hope that someone else will buy it at a higher price.



However, this behavior also highlights the inherent risk of such investments, as the market eventually runs out of willing buyers. When the hype dies down and demand dwindles, traders can remain holding worthless assets, leading to substantial financial losses.

The Crypto Infrastructure Revolution

Over time, novel applications will only get more popular and more performant as they work out what infrastructure best suits their needs. Perhaps this process will end with scaled applications running on modular solutions settling back to Ethereum, or maybe the monolithic vision will win, and Solana, Monad, Aptos or Sui will become the preferred blockchain of the masses. In the end, the market will decide what solutions work best once they can be tested at scale.

Bits + Bips: Is This the Real Reason the SEC Approved the Ethereum ETFs? - Unchained


                                After the Ethereum ETF approvals, Biden’s veto of SAB 121 lends credence to an alternative theory about the SEC’s mysterious decision. Plus, is what Roaring Kitty doing legal?

Also, they talk about why the spot ETH ETFs are already turning out to be different from the Bitcoin ETFs, Hong Kong’s (and perhaps China’s?) crypto ambitions, recent U.S. macroeconomic indicators, and whether or not Roaring Kitty’s recent antics with GME stock are illegal—and how he’s impacting memecoins.

Decentralized Finance Is Poised to Transform Bitcoin

Despite bitcoin being the original cryptocurrency and corresponding blockchain, its functionality has been extremely limited up to this point relative to the smart contracts and decentralized finance (DeFi) functionality offered by Ethereum, Solana and other blockchains. However, this dynamic is set to change with the emergence of Bitcoin Layers, the meta-protocols, sidechains, layer 2’s and other technologies currently being built on the Bitcoin blockchain. These layers will enable faster payments, as well as lending, enhanced functionality of fungible and non-fungible tokens, decentralized exchanges, GameFi, SocialFi and many other use cases. Holders of bitcoin will soon be able to increase the productivity of their asset via a protocol-based decentralized financial system. The primary differentiator between DeFi on Bitcoin and DeFi on other chains is the underlying asset (native token). Whereas Ethereum, Solana and next-gen blockchains compete on the merits of their respective technologies, DeFi on Bitcoin is purely focused on increasing the productivity of bitcoin, placing the Bitcoin DeFi ecosystem in a league of its own.

Has the Bottom Come for Bitcoin (BTC)? New Bullish Signal from CryptoQuant! - Bitcoin Sistemi

After Bitcoin's ATH of $73,800 in March, it experienced sharp corrections to $56,000 due to profit taking by long-term investors.
While BTC has recovered following these corrections, it has been following a horizontal course in recent weeks. While market analysts stated that Bitcoin was preparing for a major rally after the current consolidation phase, CryptoQuant analyst also predicted that Bitcoin may be preparing for an increase.


At this point, CryptoQuant analyst, who examined the Bitcoin NVT Golden Cross indicator, claimed that according to this indicator, Bitcoin may be signaling a potential local bottom around $ 69,000.
Stating that there has not been a local bottom of -1.6 points in the NVT Golden Cross indicator since the start of spot Bitcoin ETF entries in 2024, the analyst said that since February 2024, NVT Golden Cross has seen local local bottoms between 0.00 and -1.00 points. He said he did it.





Stating that the Bitcoin NVT Golden Cross indicator is currently at 0.14 points, the analyst predicts that the bottom may be close in BTC.

“Is Bitcoin NVT Golden Cross signaling a potential local bottom around $69K?
In Bitcoin NVT GC data, the red zone indicates a local top and the green zone indicates a local bottom.
However, with the recent inclusion of Spot ETFs, the situation has become a little more complicated.
While there has been no local bottom of -1.6 points in NVT GC since the increase in Spot ETF inflows in February 2024, we have witnessed local bottoms in the range of 0.00 to -1.00 points.
As of now, NVT GC is at 0.14 points. This level indicates that Bitcoin may soon see a local bottom in the $69,000-$70,000 region.
Yesterday's $886.6 million spot BTC ETF inflow also supports this. “

Bitcoin continues to trade at $70,740 at the time of writing.

Beware of airdrops: Tether CEO warns of mailing list breach


The crypto community has been advised by Tether CEO Paolo Ardoino to remain vigilant following the reported compromise of a mailing list management platform that works with crypto companies.
In a post on X (formerly Twitter), Ardoino claimed to have received two separate reports that “a prominent vendor” had been compromised.
The breach was confirmed by CoinGecko’s Bobby Ong, who warned users to be on the lookout for suspicious emails, which may include scams such as “fake token launches.”
In an industry plagued by constant scams, a crypto-specific mailing list can be a lucrative resource for parting unsuspecting users with their tokens.
Last September, a similar air of paranoia swept the community when data analysis platform Nansen was breached, losing email addresses and some users’ (hashed) passwords and blockchain addresses.

Read more: Pink Drainer ‘steps back from the grind’ after stealing $75M from victims
A digital minefield
As well as targeted emails, victims are typically lured in via broader brush approaches, which then serves victims with a ‘wallet drainer’ script. Compromised (or lookalike) accounts on X take advantage of FOMO by imitating genuine projects, promising airdrops or the chance to be ‘early’ to a new token. 
Another approach involves leveraging users’ fear, replying to legitimate posts in the wake of a hack, with malicious links promising to refund victims or secure users wallets from imminent danger.
Just yesterday, a user lost over $2M worth of crypto to a phishing scam. Blockchain investigator ZachXBT, who flagged the loss via his Telegram channel, suspects the victim likely fell for a fake airdrop announcement published by Renzo Protocol’s compromised X account.
Read more: Depeg of $3B restaking token ezETH causes over $60M in DeFi liquidations
Staying safe
Various tools exist for spotting these scams before it’s too late, yet millions of dollars worth of crypto is still lost each month.
Some tools aim to make malicious X accounts more visible, highlighting posts originating from accounts that aim to impersonate a legitimate organization or individual.
Wallet guards, such as BlockAid, are able to simulate the results of a transaction before signing, and can warn users if their funds will be transferred unexpectedly, or to a known malicious actor. However, a high proportion of false positives has led some to criticize the approach, worried it will lead to a ‘boy who cried wolf’ situation.
Last year, in order to combat so-called ‘address poisoning’ scams, popular Ethereum block explorer Etherscan added two new features to its website.
The scam involves fake tokens, or small amounts of genuine tokens, being sent to crypto users from ‘spoofed’ addresses in the hope that the user will mistakenly copy the malicious address while making future transfers.

In April, zero-value token transfers were hidden by default. Then, in November, address highlighting was added, in an attempt to make spoofed addresses less effective.

Ripple Scores Major Partnership in Europe


San Francisco-based firm Ripple has joined forces with UK-based payment company Clear Junction in order to improve the efficiency and security of payouts denominated in the British pound and the euro. Ripple's Cassie Craddock has stressed that Clear Junction is "a great fit" for the company since it is capable of supporting all of its existing use cases. Craddock believes that the partnership between the two companies is going to evolve further in the future.  Last September, Clear Junction acquired British cryptocurrency firm Altalix in order to gain a competitive edge in the crypto market.Earlier this year, the Financial Times, one of the leading business outlets, named Altalix as one of the fastest-growing European companies.  Clear Junction is also known as one of Binance's payment partners. In September 2021, it cut the exchange off due to a regulatory crackdown in the U.K. Billionaire Chris Larsen, one of the co-founders of Ripple, praised the UK as one of the most crypto-friendly jurisdictions last year after Chancellor Jeremy Hunt singled out digital technology as one of the key growth sectors. Susan Friedman, head of policy at Ripple, has also recognized London as a burgeoning cryptocurrency hub. Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse has repeatedly named the UK alongside some other crypto-friendly countries like Japan and Singapore in order to highlight the correct approach to crypto regulation. In fact, Ripple once considered relocating its headquarters to London.  Last year, the company also expanded its University Blockchain Research Initiative (UBRI) to several European universities.

3 Top Cryptos Worth Holding Beyond Bitcoin and Ethereum - Tokenist


					
Neither the author, Tim Fries, nor this website, The Tokenist, provide financial advice. Please consult our website policy prior to making financial decisions.



Among thousands of cryptocurrencies, it is clear that Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) took the public spotlight and are likely to take more capital inflows in the future. So much so that even Ethereum is poised to become an institutional investment vehicle via exchange-traded funds (ETFs), joining Bitcoin.



Out of a total $2.63 trillion market cap, including stablecoins, ETH and BTC make 70% of the crypto pie. Year-to-date, Bitcoin and Ethereum are neck and neck, having gained 60% and 62% value, respectively. 



However, the larger the market cap, the harder it is to move the price upwards, just like in the stock market. This is why many low-cap memecoins performed well during 2024, driven by speculation and memory. 



Yet, engaging in memecoins is exceedingly risky. Most traders can’t tell if they are riding from the top to the bottom, holding the devalued bags, or riding from the bottom to the top, enjoying substantial profits. After all, memecoins’ value is inherently unclear, which makes them so speculative in the first place.



To that end, prospective crypto investors should look into these infrastructure cryptocurrencies, which are backed by developers, funding, and clear goals.



Immutable X (IMX)



Immutable X (IMX) is an investor’s exposure to blockchain gaming. While Ethereum is a blockchain network for issuing tokens and smart contracts to power decentralized finance (DeFi) with dApps, it relies on layer 2 networks to scale. Immutable X is one of those networks. 



Owing to StarkWare’s zk-rollups technology, Immutable X facilitates zero gas fees for end-users. This contrasts Ethereum’s expensive and volatile gas fees for even simple token transfers. In turn, this is a game changer for game developers who wish to deploy their products at scale.



For instance, if a game has tradable in-game assets as non-fungible tokens (NFTs), like cards or collectible creatures, traders don’t have to worry about long confirmation times and heavy transaction fees. This boosts the in-game economy and player experience, paving the way for blockchain gaming. 



Presently, there are over 300 games in Immutable’s funding ecosystem worth $1 billion over 20 marketplaces. Previously known as Fuel Games, Immutable is the parent company in charge of the Immutable X framework for developers to launch their projects with low friction.



The cryptocurrency itself, IMX, is the utility and governance token of the network. Akin to shareholders of companies, IMX tokenholders get a say in the development of the platform with a voting mechanism. Additionally, developers using the platform pay 2% fee in IMX tokens. 



For comparison, game developers deploying their games on Steam suffer a 30% sales cut. The total IMX token supply is limited, just like Bitcoin, but to a greater extent, it has 2 billion IMX tokens, of which 74% are already in a circulating supply.



Year-to-date, the IMX token has gained 12% value after price correction but 393% over the last year. Given that the Immutable X network is Ethereum-adjacent, the token is likely to revisit previous highs with the prospective launch of ETH ETFs. According to Fortune Business Insights, the blockchain gaming market is forecasted for a 21.8% CAGR between 2023 and 2030. 





Avalanche (AVAX)



Ethereum’s software engineering path relies on layer 2 networks to offload the transaction burden from the main network. Avalanche (AVAX) is a competitive, versatile network that picked another approach.



Instead of users having to jump through network hoops with their Web3 wallets, Avalanche itself has a modular design via subnets. Each subnet has its own rules and consensus mechanisms, but they all operate under the high-throughput Avalanche consensus protocol.



In addition, Avalanche boosts scaling with three interoperable blockchains within the network. X-Chain, C-Chain, and P-Chain tackle different aspects of the network, like staking, smart contracts, and asset creation.



This leads to a greater unified experience for the end-user, who still enjoys fast execution and low fees. Moreover, Avalanche’s C-Chain ensures compatibility with Ethereum, enabling users to transfer digital assets with Avalanche Bridge via the Core wallet.



Attesting to Avalanche’s approach to blockchain design, several banks used it to test their future tokenization efforts, including Bank of America, Citi and JPMorgan.



Powering the network’s economy, the AVAX token is limited to 720 million, of which 55% is in circulation. AVAX token holders get a say in the issuance of the remaining supply. Year-to-date, AVAX is down 14%, making for a solid entry point after a one-year value growth of 160%. 







Fetch.AI (FET)



Just as Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) reaped the AI hype, Fetch.AI did the same in the blockchain world. The FET token gained 794% value over one year, or 194% YTD. Moving forward, this is crypto investor’s main exposure to the tokenization of AI projects. 



That’s because Fetch.AI (FET), SingularityNET (AGIX), and Ocean Protocol (OCEAN) will all be under the umbrella of the SuperIntelligence Alliance, with its new universal token ASI, poised to merge the market caps of FET, AGIX, and OCEAN tokens.



After the merger into ASI, FET tokens will be limited to a 2.63 billion supply. Mirroring the decentralization efforts of finance to counter banks and central banking, the new network’s purpose is to monetize AI development openly and transparently.



This includes raising funds for AI projects with ASI tokens, paying transaction fees, using it as a governance token for voting, and using it as a utility for open-source AI development. After the merger announcement in mid-April, the FET price has been moving sideways, having dropped by 3%.

Trader Sketches 'Somewhat Safe' Bitcoin, Ethereum, Dogecoin Investment Ideas For 4 To 7 Figure Portfolios - Benzinga

Crypto analyst Altcoin Sherpa shared strategies for trading and investing in various portfolio sizes, offering tailored advice for crypto enthusiasts with different financial backgrounds.What Happened: Sherpa's tweet breaks down investment strategies into different tiers based on the amount of capital one is working with. He provides options ranging from relatively safe bets to high-risk, high-reward scenarios. However, investors who want to check their portfolio only once in three months should buy Bitcoin BTC/USD and Ethereum ETH/USD.
For Seven Figures or More
The trader suggests sticking to major cryptocurrencies like Ethereum and Dogecoin DOGE/USD, "ETH to ATH, DOGE to $0.40+". These established assets are considered safer bets given their stability and potential for growth.Investors with six-figure portfolios are advised to look at trending meme coins. "Can go with Pepe PEPE/USD or one of the Solana memes like Dogwifhat WIF/USD/Bonk BONK/USD," he noted. These meme coins have seen significant volatility, offering the potential for strong returnsSherpa advocates for a more risk-on approach for those with five-figure investments. He suggests looking into less mainstream projects. "Probably avoid all of the above and get to work and go riskier for generational wealth," he stated, pointing to options like PURR with Hyperliquid, BTC ecosystem ventures, and unusual ecosystems like Mode.Investors with four-figure portfolios are cautioned against meme coins due to their high risk. Instead, they are encouraged to pursue strategies like those suggested for five-figure portfolios but with an even greater emphasis on risk.Also Read: This Trader Sees A ‘Barbell Portfolio Of BTC And Memes’ As Most Profitable Trading StrategyWhy It Matters: Sherpa noted that his suggestions are "going farther and farther down the risk curve" with the lesser investment that a trader can undertake. While he acknowledges the experience of seasoned traders, "With that said if you’ve gotten to six figures+ in crypto, you’ve probably already taken a lot of these risks before and are a veteran."He highlights that as the portfolio size decreases, the need for taking on more risk grows, but so does the chance of significant losses.Meanwhile, his recommendation to buy BTC, and ETH reinforces the stability and growth potential of these foundational assets in any crypto portfolio.What’s Next: The influence of Bitcoin as an institutional asset class is expected to be thoroughly explored at Benzinga’s upcoming Future of Digital Assets event on Nov. 19.Read Next: Top Crypto Trader Dumps Entire Bitcoin Portfolio To Buy Altcoins, But Should You Be Taking This ‘Huge’ RiskThis content was partially produced with the help of AI tools and was reviewed and published by Benzinga editors.Image: Shutterstock

Turkish Authorities Dismantle $1 Billion Crypto Ponzi Scheme


							

Turkish authorities have busted a $1 billion cryptocurrency Ponzi scheme.



FBI reports a 53% surge in cryptocurrency scam losses in 2023 to $3.94 billion.



Turkey plans transaction tax on stocks and crypto assets to boost fiscal discipline.




Turkish law enforcement successfully dismantled a criminal organization accused of running an illegal cryptocurrency Ponzi scheme. The gang reportedly convinced unsuspecting citizens to invest a combined $1 billion, promising high returns.



In a coordinated crackdown, Turkish authorities arrested 127 individuals linked to the fake crypto investment scheme and seized 238 assets worth over $31 million.



Last month, Beijing’s police solved a case involving an organized crypto-pyramid scheme. The complainant, Xie, ironically emerged as the prime suspect. Seeking rapid financial gains, Xie invested in cryptocurrency through an organization called ‘Hua.’ He eventually recruited over 300 individuals across nine levels and became the scheme’s lead figure.



Losses from cryptocurrency scams rose by 53% in 2023, totaling $3.94 billion, according to the FBI. The FBI’s Internet Crime Report 2023 indicates a broader increase in investment fraud, reaching $4.57 billion. Cryptocurrency scams comprise a substantial portion of this total. The report said:




“Fraudsters are increasingly using custodial accounts held at financial institutions for cryptocurrency exchanges or third-party payment processors, or having targeted individuals send funds directly to these platforms where funds are quickly dispersed,”




In a separate development, Reuters reported that Turkey is set to implement a transaction tax on stock and crypto asset trades.









“The move is part of tightening measures that Finance Minister Mehmet Simsek is pushing through to boost fiscal discipline and price stability after years of turmoil that fueled soaring inflation,” Reuters stated.



Simsek recently signaled the government’s intent to introduce a minimum corporate tax to ensure a more equitable tax framework. Meanwhile, President Tayyip Erdogan’s ruling party submitted a bill proposing licensing and registration requirements for providers of crypto asset services. This move underscores Turkey’s commitment to regulating the crypto sector in lieu of the growing concerns of investor protection and financial stability.

Missing ‘Cryptoqueen’ Behind $4,000,000,000 OneCoin Fraud May Never Be Found: Report - The Daily Hodl


								The infamous scammer behind the $4 billion OneCoin fraud allegedly worked with a prolific drug kingpin, according to a new report.
Ruja Ignatova, a Bulgarian woman known as the “Cryptoqueen,” started OneCoin in 2014 and operated the company as a multi-level marketing (MLM) network.










Ignatova falsely claimed the project maintained a private blockchain, and the fraud reportedly lured in more than 3.5 million victims.
Ignatova has been a fugitive since 2017 and was placed on the FBI’s Ten Most Wanted list in 2022. A February 2023 report from BIRD, a Bulgarian investigative journalism outlet, indicated she may have been murdered at the order of suspected drug lord Hristoforos ‘Taki’ Amanatidis.
BIRD cited documents found at the home of a former top Bulgarian police officer, Lyubomir Ivanov, after he was murdered last year.
A new report from the BBC indicates US government lawyers said Ignatova employed Amanatidis as her head of security. A different US government lawyer reportedly said in court that the head of security was “involved in the disappearance” of Ignatova.
The BBC also reports that leaked Europol documents indicate police suspect Taki used OneCoin’s financial network to launder drug money.
The FBI says it will pay out a $250,000 reward for information leading to Ignatova’s arrest.

All of Michael Saylor’s Ethereum predictions were wrong


Michael Saylor has made a lot of predictions during his career. And because he became a billionaire in the process, many assume that his forecasts are generally accurate. For example, Bitcoiners applauded his support for — and multi-billion dollar purchases of — bitcoin. He invested at the right times and prices and has earned billions in profit. So when Saylor decided to place a bet on the future of Ethereum, millions listened.
Unfortunately, Saylor got all of his predictions about Ethereum totally wrong. 
First, he predicted that the SEC would classify Ethereum as an unregistered security. At his corporate conference in Las Vegas a few weeks ago, he said, “Sometime this summer it will become very clear to everyone that Ethereum is deemed a crypto asset security, not a commodity.”
Second, Saylor predicted that US stock markets would never list a spot Ethereum ETF. “It will never be wrapped in a spot ETF. It will not be accepted by Wall Street; it will not be accepted by mainstream institutional investors.”
Furthermore, he claimed that spot bitcoin ETFs would be the first and last type of spot cryptocurrency ETF. Pointing to the Bitcoin logo, he said, “This is the one, universal, consensus-accepted, institutional-grade crypto asset in the world. There won’t be another one.”
Every one of those predictions turned out to be wrong within five weeks.

Saylor lost all his bets on Ethereum
Despite Joe Lubin’s ConsenSys lawsuit against the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) claiming that commissioners secretly classified Ethereum as a security in some redacted document, there’s no public evidence that they have actually done so.

Read more: ConsenSys says the SEC designated ETH a security but won’t say where
Furthermore, the SEC recently approved three 19b-4 exchange rule change requests from three US stock markets — NYSE, NASDAQ, and CBOE — to list spot ether ETFs. With those landmark approvals out of the way, the SEC will soon review and is widely expected to approve associated S-1 filings from up to nine ETF sponsors.
Worse for Saylor, those sponsors include the largest and most mainstream Wall Street institutions imaginable: BlackRock, Fidelity, Franklin Templeton, Ark, and others.
That sets a final score for Saylor’s three bets on Ethereum at 0-3: no SEC unregistered securities designation (yet, at least), likely SEC spot ether ETF approval, and mainstream institutional investor support.
Saylor lost many bets, then won one
Of course, Saylor has lost other bets during his career. For example, he lost $15 million in his bet that Washington DC wouldn’t notice his $25 million tax evasion scheme. A few days ago, he agreed to pay $40 million to resolve his tax fraud lawsuit.
Saylor also lost $8.5 million in his bet that he would avoid an SEC penalty for declaring false financials during the dot-com mania. He paid $8.2 million in stock plus $350,000 to settle.
Saylor also lost an uncomfortable number of bets about the best corporate strategy for MicroStrategy for two full decades. From late 2000 through 2020, MicroStrategy stock failed to rally anywhere close to an all-time high despite Saylor’s continuous leadership. Finally, in recent months, and thanks to an improved price of bitcoin, shares are approximately two-thirds of their way back to their dot-com highs.
In all, Saylor got a lot of bets wrong in his career, but only one mattered. His prediction that bitcoin was worth buying on margin has made up for all of his previous and subsequent errors. His company, MicroStrategy, owns 214,400 bitcoins today worth over $15 billion after buying at an average price of $35,180 per coin. With the crypto trading at double that price today, MicroStrategy has doubled its $7.5 billion investment.

JUST IN: Paxos, Previously Issued BUSD, Now Introduces a New Stablecoin - It Has a Feature First in History - Bitcoin Sistemi


According to breaking information, cryptocurrency trading platform Paxos announced today that it introduced a USD-denominated stablecoin called Lift Dollar (USDL), which is issued and yields in the United Arab Emirates (UAE).
Cryptocurrency trading platform Paxos announced the launch of Lift Dollar (USDL), a new yield-generating USD-denominated stablecoin. The stablecoin is issued in the United Arab Emirates (UAE) and was introduced today.


Lift Dollar is issued by Paxos International, the firm's UAE division, and is regulated by the Financial Services Regulatory Authority (FSRA) of Abu Dhabi Global Market (ADGM). The move comes as major stablecoin issuers such as Tether and Circle accumulate billions of dollars worth of interest on the US-dated bonds they hold.
Paxos CEO Charles Cascarilla explained that Lift Dollar is structured similarly to other stablecoins issued by the firm, including PayPal USD (PYUSD), Pax Dollar (USDP), and Pax Gold (PAXG). These stablecoins are matched 1:1 to the dollar, backed by short-term US government securities, and all are overseen by a prudential regulator. All assets are safely positioned away from potential bankruptcy situations.





“We added programmatic daily returns so it looks a little more like a savings product than a checking account product, which is perhaps the way to think about it for traditional stablecoins,” Cascarilla said. said.
Due to lack of regulatory guidance, Paxos USDL will not be available in the US. However, it will be accessible to individuals who want to hold dollars in many other regions, including Europe, the United Kingdom, and Japan.

Bitcoin Needs To Hold Above $70,000 For Bullish Momentum: Analyst | Bitcoinist.com


								Bitcoin, the largest cryptocurrency asset by market cap, broke through the $70,000 resistance level today, demonstrating momentum for further upsurge. Delving into the significance of this development, cryptocurrency analyst and trader YG Crypto has emphasized that Bitcoin must break above the level and maintain that break in order for the digital asset to regain its bullish momentum.
The $70,000 Price Mark Is Crucial For Bitcoin
The analyst’s findings underscore the possibility of large price swings if this barrier is overcome and sustained, which coincides with the resurgence of interest in BTC among institutional and individual investors. This resistance level is believed to be crucial for sustaining market optimism and propelling Bitcoin’s upward trend toward new all-time heights.

YG Crypto noted that Bitcoin tried to break out when the United States market opened, but the barrier near the $70,000 mark persisted. “We might see another attempt soon, but a sustained break above this level is crucial for regaining bullish momentum,” he added.

Furthermore, the crypto expert highlighted that should the coin manage to clear this obstacle, it may aim for even greater prices in the coming days. Thus, he has urged the crypto community to watch out for impending economic data that may have an impact on investors‘ moods.
Well-known cryptocurrency expert Michael Van De Poppe has also shared insights on the development, further proving that the level is critical for the next phase of the crypto asset. Michael Van De Poppe claims that currently, BTC keeps grinding higher slowly, which may have propelled the coin to break through the $70,000 price level. Following the breakout, the analyst believes BTC is probably headed for a new all-time high in the foreseeable future.
At the time of writing, Bitcoin was changing hands between $70,990 and $71,000, indicating an over 3% increase in the last 24 hours. Both its market cap and trading volume have also seen positive sentiment, rising by over 3% and 30%, respectively, in the past day.
BTC Is One Weekly Close From Entering The Parabolic Phase
Bitcoin’s recent momentum has garnered several bullish price predictions from market experts lately, presenting the coin as a potential asset in the rapidly changing cryptocurrency market. Crypto strategist Rekt Capital has underlined the asset is on the brink of transitioning into a parabolic phase. 

According to the analyst, BTC has returned to the Range High of the Re-accumulation Range and the result is unchanged. Thus, the parabolic phase which the analyst previously predicted will occur after BTC breaks out of the re-accumulation, is only one weekly close above the range high from entering the phase.
However, past trends indicate that BTC might not be able to accomplish this within 50 days after the Halving event. “Will historical tendencies prevail, or will Bitcoin continue its Accelerated Cycle with a historic breakout?, he added.

Bitcoin, Ethereum, Solana Over 150% Annual Gains Leave The Stock Market, Gold In The Dust


																Despite the relative tepid movement in the crypto market since Bitcoin hit a new all-time high (ATH) in March, Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Solana have continued to top traditional assets, including Gold. This was highlighted in a recent report that showed how crypto assets have provided the best returns for a while now. 
Bitcoin, Ethereum, And Solana Outperform Traditional Assets
Raoul Pal, Co-Founder of Exponential Age Asset Management (EXPAAM), shared the crypto investment firm’s latest monthly update, showing annualized returns on all major assets.

Thanks to this, these crypto assets have been the best-performing assets in 11 of the last 14 years. These digital assets also look on course to outperform traditional assets again this year, as they boast higher year-to-date (YTD) gains. Data from CoinMarketCap shows that Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Solana currently have YTD gains of over 67%, 66% and 70%, respectively. 
On the other hand, Gold, the best-performing non-crypto asset this year, has a YTD gain of 13%. The NDX boasts a YTD gain of 10%, while the SPY has recorded a YTD gain of 11%. Interestingly, while the volatility of crypto assets has been criticized at times, this has largely contributed to why they have continued outperforming traditional assets. 
The Director of Global Macro at Fidelity Investments, Jurrien Timmer, previously highlighted how Bitcoin has continued to record the best risk-reward since 2020. He also alluded to Bitcoin’s high volatility, stating that Bitcoin’s huge drawdowns have also come with large gains. The same can also said about crypto tokens, especially considering that a token like Solana, which dropped to as low as $10 in late 2022, is now trading above $170. 
More Gains Ahead For BTC, ETH, SOL
Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Solana are expected to record more YTD gains as the year progresses, given that the crypto market is currently in a bull run. Recent developments in the crypto market also paint a bullish outlook for these crypto tokens. One is the increased demand for the Spot Bitcoin ETFs. Data from Farside Investors showed that these funds recorded net inflows of $886.6 million on June 4, their best day since March.

Meanwhile, the Spot Ethereum ETFs are expected to begin trading by July. Crypto analysts like Michael van de Poppe predict these funds could spark a significant rally for Ethereum and other altcoins. ‘Solana Summer’ also looks to be on the horizon, with the crypto token showing signs of imminent parabolic upward trend. 
At the time of writing, Bitcoin has broken above the $70,000 resistance level and is trading at around $71,000, up almost 3% in the last 24 hours, according to data from CoinMarketCap.

Crypto Trading Firm Paxos Unveils Yield-Bearing Stablecoin USDL

“We’ve added programmatic daily yield so this looks a little bit more like a savings product than a checking account product, which is maybe the way to think about traditional stablecoins,” Cascarilla said in an interview. “[USDL] is going one step further from democratizing access to dollars, to also democratizing the risk-free rate, in the safest manner possible.”

Shiba Inu Rallies on Renewed Investor Confidence, Echoing 2021 Surge


							

Early SHIB investors acquire nearly 1 trillion tokens, boosting market confidence.



Whale purchases drive SHIB price up 4.6%, signaling potential bullish trend.



Renewed interest in Shiba Inu from early investors hints at future gains.




Shiba Inu coin witnessed a surge in activity that has captured the attention of investors. Early investors have re-entered the market, purchasing almost one trillion SHIB tokens.



This large transaction has fueled speculation of a price surge reminiscent of 2021’s bull run. This renewed interest from early SHIB investors signals their confidence in the project’s future potential.



One notable transaction involved an early buyer, often referred to just as “whale,” who spent 1,000 Wrapped Ethereum (WETH), approximately $3.83 million, to acquire 149.3 billion SHIB. This whale still holds 1,169 WETH, valued at around $4.45 million. Such moves by early investors typically indicate a belief in the asset’s long-term value.



Furthermore, another significant transaction occurred involving an early buyer who previously profited $145 million from SHIB. This entity had been inactive for two years before reentering the market.



Within a six-hour window, the investor exchanged 4,849 WETH, equivalent to $18.5 million, for 715.8 billion SHIB. This transaction triggered a 4.6% price surge for SHIB. Currently, the entity holds 9,207 ETH and WETH worth $34.9 million, suggesting the possibility of further purchases.







The recent transactions gain significance when considering SHIB’s historical context. The coin launched in 2021 and reached an all-time high of $0.0000857 during the bull market. Although the current trading price is $0.00002572 at the time of writing, the renewed interest from seasoned investors hints at a potential bullish rally.









Additionally, the substantial investments and calculated acquisitions by early investors point toward a potential bullish trend for Shiba Inu. Enthusiasts and market analysts are closely monitoring these strategic moves, which could foreshadow a significant market shift similar to the 2021 gains.



The large capital infusions and strategic acquisitions by early investors suggest a potential price increase for Shiba Inu. Market participants are closely observing these moves, which could indicate expectations of a significant market rally akin to that of 2021.

Solana Stablecoin Inflows Totaled $1.5 Billion in 6 months.


Solana has experienced a significant surge in stablecoin inflows, amounting to billions over the past six months. During this period, SOL price has soared by nearly 250%.
The total stablecoin market capitalization currently stands at $161 billion, approximately 14% from the $188 billion all-time high recorded in April 2022. Analysts suggest the Layer-1 token could see even greater gains if the stablecoin market capitalization returns to its peak.
Solana Stablecoin Inflows Drive SOL Price Rally

The volume of stablecoin inflows into the Solana network has reached $1.5 billion since December 2023, DefiLlama data shows. During this period, the SOL price is up 246% to $173 at the time of writing. The current value of stablecoins on Solana is $3.04 billion, while the total value locked (TVL) sits at $4.92 billion.
Stablecoin inflows and the rise in Solana’s price are closely connected. Higher liquidity makes it easier to trade SOL tokens, leading to more trading activity and investment.
As a result, demand for SOL tokens increases, pushing the price higher. This growing interest and investment further boost confidence in the Solana network, attracting more developers, projects, and users.

The crypto community shares this positive outlook on Solana. Many believe that the continued inflow of stablecoins will further strengthen the network’s liquidity and trading volume. 
Stablecoin market capitalization peaked at $188 billion in April 2022. Currently, DefiLlama reports it at $160 billion. According to pseudonymous blockchain researcher Gumshoe, closing this $28 billion gap could lead to a 102% increase in SOL’s price from its current level of $173.

“When stablecoin market cap goes back to ATHs, SOL will be at a $350 minimum”, said Gumshoe.

Moreover, a recent CoinShares report highlights up to $5.8 million in weekly inflows into Solana-based instruments. Significant investments from large financial entities indicate institutional interest and confidence in the asset’s potential.
SOL Price Outlook

Solana price is trading with a bullish bias, holding within the confines of an ascending parallel channel. It faces immediate resistance due to the mean threshold of $177.24. This is the midline of the supply zone, extending from $167.78 to $187.01.
A decisive candlestick close above this roadblock would see SOL price extend the gains to the next resistance order block between $194.12 and $202.47. Breaching its midline at $198.28 would set the tone for an extended move north. SOL could then go as high as to reclaim the $210.18 peak of the March 19 trading session.
Momentum indicators show that SOL bulls are primed for more buying momentum. This is seen with the Relative Strength Index (RSI) crossover above its signal line (yellow band). The Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) is also at the cusp of crossing above its signal line (orange band). These crossovers suggest growing bullish sentiment and a stronger likelihood of positive price movement.

On the flip side, a rejection from the channel’s center line and a slip below the immediate support of $162.75 could trigger panic selling. Nevertheless, the bullish outlook for SOL would only be invalidated once the Solana price closes below $126.88 in the one-day timeframe.

New Base Dawgz Presale Raises $250k In One Day - Next 100x Meme Coin?


This article was paid for*
The much-hyped launch of Base Dawgz’s presale has caught the attention of meme coin enthusiasts, both retail investors and whales alike. 
Indeed, it is rare for such new meme coins to already receive praise from smart-money traders. However, YouTube trading expert ClayBro – who has close to 130k subscribers – did not hesitate to claim that Base Dawgz could create future millionaires.

VIDEO

The token has already raised over $250k in its ICO in less than a day, potentially a sign of its high upside potential. 
What is Base Dawgz?
Base Dawgz (Dawgz) is a new dog-themed meme coin on the Base blockchain. 
Base meme coins are quickly emerging as the new meta, with the asset class already boasting a market capitalization of over $2 billion. With Coinbase looking to integrate the L2 chain into more of its services, Base’s valuation is expected to skyrocket. 
Considering that Solana meme coins already have a market cap of over $10 billion, experts believe that Base meme coin investors are likely extremely early. 

Base’s top token is Brett, which currently has a market cap of over $1 billion. Analysts expect Brett to remain one of the top-performing meme coins, which could draw attention to the high upside potential of other Base tokens such as $DAWGZ. 
However, Brett is not a dog-themed token. In fact, none of the top 5 meme coins on Base belong to the doge genre. DAWGZ is aiming to change this fact and emerge as the next big meme coin on Base. 
Despite DAWGZ being native to Base, it also boasts multi-chain status. In fact, the meme coin is live on Solana, Ethereum, BNB Smart Chain and Avalanche. This means investors can buy DAWGZ with ETH, BNB, SOL, USDT and AVAX during the presale. 
Staking, Share-to-Earn Contribute to DAWGZ’s Strong Fundamentals
Floki’s recent success has highlighted the importance of strong fundamentals, even in meme coins. The Base Dawgz project also prioritizes this, as seen by its multi-chain status. 
However, the developer team behind the token has also introduced a novel share-to-earn utility. It allows investors to share DAWGZ-related content on social media, be it memes, important updates, etc and earn free crypto for it. 
Similarly, investors can create their own referral links from the Base Dawgz website. They will receive 10% of every presale investment made through their link. 
Investors should not see this only as an opportunity to earn free crypto. The share-to-earn concept could be a game changer in increasing the meme coin’s brand awareness, which could provide a massive boost to its price. 
Additionally, presale buyers can stake their holdings to earn additional passive income. They can expect the staking protocol to go live within the next few days. Investors are advised to follow the Base Dawgz X and Telegram accounts to keep up with the latest updates. 
DAWGZ’s community-centric tokenomics also contributes to its strong fundamentals. No portion of its token supply is reserved for the developer team or any private sale. 20% of the tokens will be used up in the presale while the staking protocol and community rewards will receive 20% and 15% of the supply each. 

The remaining tokens are allocated to the project’s marketing strategy, listings and token liquidity. 
Finally, the Base Dawgz smart contract has been audited by SolidProof, which did not reveal any vulnerabilities or security risks. 
Is Base Dawgz The Next 100x Meme Coin?
As previously mentioned, experts and smart-money traders are already bullish on DAWGZ. 
In another instance, popular YouTuber Jacob Bury believes that Base Dawgz could potentially be the next 100x meme coin. Considering the demand for Base meme coins and the token’s strong fundamentals, his projection is not much of a surprise. 

Investors currently have the opportunity to earn the maximum profits, considering that DAWGZ is at its lowest presale price of $0.00479. However, this price is set to increase by 5% in just over 5 days. 
Interested buyers can visit the basedawgz.com website and use the over-the-counter widget to purchase the meme coin.

Lawmakers Seek to Skirt Biden’s Anti-Crypto Veto, Tighten SEC’s Purse - Decrypt

U.S. House lawmakers are set to debate legislation Wednesday that would restrict the Securities and Exchange Commission’s (SEC) ability to carry out a controversial crypto accounting rule.The bill from the House Committee on Appropriations outlines funding for government agencies through September 2025, and for Wall Street’s top regulator, it comes with several strings attached. While slashing the SEC’s annual budget by nearly $145 million, the bill also prohibits the SEC from implementing or enforcing Staff Accounting Bulletin (SAB) 121. The rule introduced and enacted last year requires companies custodying customers’ crypto to treat digital assets as liabilities, and hold “corresponding assets” on their balance sheets against them.Lawmakers in the House and Senate recently passed a bill erasing the SEC’s rule—with votes in both chambers of Congress drawing bipartisan support. However, the measure was later vetoed by President Joe Biden, as his administration had promised to do.Though advocates of overturning SAB 121 would need a two-thirds majority in the House and Senate to override Biden’s veto, the spending bill debated Wednesday provides an alternative means for Republican-led efforts to rein in the SEC. However, the bill would be subject to markup in the Democrat-controlled Senate on its way to eventually becoming law.A summary of the bill published by the Committee—which is chaired by Rep. Tom Cole (R-OK)—claimed SAB 121 “implements harmful digital asset requirements.” Lawmakers have previously described SAB 121 as an overstep of the SEC’s regulatory authority.“It provides sensible cuts to federal financial and consumer protection agencies and prohibits funding for their overreaching, harmful, regulatory policies,” Cole said of the bill in prepared remarks.At the same time, the bill debated Wednesday restricts the SEC’s ability to carry out enforcement actions related to “digital asset transactions,” except for instances of fraud and market manipulation. Until the SEC clarifies which digital assets are securities under existing law, or it’s granted new authorities, the bill prohibits the SEC from policing crypto broadly.To temper the “aggressive” nature of the SEC’s Enforcement Division, the bill’s summary states that its funding would be limited to $644 million in the government’s coming fiscal year. The figure represents a $168 million decrease compared to a request from the Biden administration.The SEC requested $2.6 billion in March, citing its oversight of around 40,000 entities in a report. Describing the digital assets industry as a space “rife with noncompliance,” the agency asked for more resources to address “critical and evolving risks” associated with the industry.Providing the SEC with $2 billion, the spending bill’s allocation comes in nearly $590 million below that request. On top of that, the proposed appropriation falls below the nearly $2.2 billion the SEC was allocated for regulating markets in the government’s current fiscal year.Edited by Andrew HaywardDaily Debrief NewsletterStart every day with the top news stories right now, plus original features, a podcast, videos and more.

New Development in the Altcoin Case that Binance Delisted Years Ago: Users Demand $13 Billion - Bitcoin Sistemi


According to a recent development, Binance, the world's largest cryptocurrency exchange, has applied to the UK Competition Appeal Tribunal (CAT) to dismiss most of the collusion case filed against it.
The lawsuit, which also involves three other crypto exchanges, was filed by BSV Claims and could potentially be worth up to 10 billion British pounds ($13 billion).


The essence of the case lies in the fact that the BSV token was delisted by exchanges in 2019. BSV Claims argues that this action is a result of collusion and anti-competitive behavior. The firm also claims that token holders missed out on more than £9 billion in potential gains. This figure was calculated by comparing the gains made by other cryptocurrencies since delisting.

In response to these allegations, Binance asked the court to reject claims that BSV could become a major cryptocurrency. Binance's lawyer, Brian Kennelly, argued that BSV holders “could reasonably sell BSV and reinvest in similar cryptocurrencies.”





The case is being brought on behalf of an estimated 240,000 UK investors. Founded in 2022, BSV Claims is led solely by David Curries, a former chairman of the CAT and member of the House of Lords.
Other defendants in the lawsuit include Bittylicious, Kraken and Shapeshift. One of BSV's most prominent supporters is Craig Wright, who was recently ruled in a London court to have lied “extensively and repeatedly” when falsely claiming to be Satoshi Nakamoto, the inventor of Bitcoin.

Bitcoin Miners Struggle Post-Halving as Reserves Plunge - The Defiant

New Bitcoin addresses, miner revenue, transaction fees, and on-chain volumes have also dropped post-halving.
Bitcoin miners are feeling the pinch as their reserves have plummeted since the April Bitcoin halving.Data shows a steady decline in miner reserves, hitting lows not seen in years. According to on-chain analytics platform CryptoQuant, reserves fell to 1.80 million BTC from 1.84 million BTC a year ago, the lowest since July 2021. The 2.17% annual decline is the biggest in over a decade, marking the first significant drop since 2011​.This drop suggests miners are selling more Bitcoin to cover operational costs, likely due to reduced block rewards following the halving."Rising electricity expenses, hardware upgrades, and some miners diversifying their investments into emerging technologies like artificial intelligence contributed to the plunge in miner reserves," Kashif Raza, CEO of Bitinning, told The Defiant.Bitcoin halving is an event that typically takes place every four years, intending to decrease the rate at which new Bitcoins are created by reducing the block reward miners receive for adding a new block to the Bitcoin blockchain. Following the latest halving, miners now receive 3.125 BTC for every block issued, from 6.25 previously."With reduced rewards, only the most efficient mining operations can remain profitable. Increased competition leads to higher operational costs and thinner profit margins for miners,” said Raza.It’s not just miner reserves that are affected. New Bitcoin addresses, miner revenue, transaction fees, and even Bitcoin on-chain volumes have also plunged as side effects of the halving.New Bitcoin Addresses SlideThe number of new Bitcoin addresses created each day has dropped to its lowest level since 2019.On June 3, the figure plummeted to 265,000 — down from a previous low of 352,000 in 2019, marking a decrease of 24%. On the day of the halving, the number of daily new wallet addresses stood at 377,000.Rising new addresses usually indicate fresh investor interest, suggesting optimism and potential growth in the network. Conversely, a low number of new wallets may signal reduced investor interest and lower network activity.Data from blockchain.com indicates that the halving event notably impacted miners' revenue. It dropped from $107 million to $36 million, representing a decrease of approximately 70%.On-Chain Volume DeclinesTransaction fees on the Bitcoin network have fallen sharply too. In June, the average transaction fees (7-day moving average) have dropped to $3.70 from $4.13 a year ago. Although the launch of Runes and the post-halving period initially saw fees spike to $40 in April, they have stabilized subsequently.Lower fees generally indicate reduced network congestion and fewer transactions, which could be due to decreased user activity.The adjusted on-chain volume, which measures the total value transferred on the Bitcoin blockchain, has also seen a notable decrease. It dropped to $50 billion on June 2 from a peak of $83 billion on March 14. According to Santiment, Bitcoin's on-chain activity is nearing historic lows as traders have reduced transactions in the two months following its all-time high.“This isn't necessarily a sign of more BTC dips, but rather a signal of crowd fear and indecision,” the on-chain analytics platform tweeted.Shift to AITo mitigate these challenges, some Bitcoin miners are turning to artificial intelligence (AI) as a means to diversify and boost their revenue streams. Bitcoin miners use powerful GPUs, which can also be used to support AI computation.On June 3, Core Scientific announced on X a $3.5 billion agreement with AI cloud provider CoreWeave. Through this contract, Core Scientific will supply an additional 200 megawatts (MW) of infrastructure to support CoreWeave's high-performance computing (HPC) operations.Hut 8 also reported a substantial move in this direction. Hut 8 made its first purchase of 1,000 Nvidia GPUs and secured a customer agreement with an AI cloud platform.Meanwhile, Bit Digital said it has 251 servers actively generating revenue from AI operations, earning around $4.1 million in April alone.

Trader That Made $120,000,000 on Shiba Inu Begins Accumulating SHIB Again: On-Chain Data - The Daily Hodl


								A deep-pocketed entity who made $120 million on Shiba Inu (SHIB) is suddenly accumulating the memecoin again, according to on-chain data.
The blockchain tracking firm Lookonchain reports that “a SHIB super big winner” just spent 4,849 Ethereum (ETH), worth $18.44 million at the time, to buy 715.9 billion SHIB.










Says Lookonchain,
“This guy spent only ~$400K to buy 5.5 trillion SHIB in the early stage and sold for ~$121 million at two peaks. He made more than $120 million on SHIB before, an amazing gain!”
Source: Lookonchain/X
The crypto tracker also noticed nine other wallets belonging to two entities making massive SHIB buys.
“Nine wallets (two whales) spent $35.2 million to buy 1.356 trillion SHIB at an average price of $0.00002596 [on June 5th]!”
Source: Lookonchain/X
SHIB Is trading for $0.00002604 at time of writing, up 6.7% in the last 24 hours.
On the Solana (SOL) network, Lookonchain also noticed one crypto whale was staring at six-figure losses after continuing to accumulate sloth-themed memecoin SLERF.
“A whale withdrew 2.91 million SLERF ($923,000) and 2,280 SOL ($378,000) from Gateio [on June 4th]. Then he spent 2,281 SOL ($378,000) to buy 1.17 million SLERF. He has bought 11.9 million SLERF ($4.09 million) at an average price of $0.3432 since April 25th and currently has a loss of $266,000.”

Ripple CEO Reveals When Investors Should Expect An XRP ETF To Be Approved | Bitcoinist.com


								The Chief Executive Officer (CEO) of Ripple, Brad Garlinghouse, has shed light on the potential timeline for an XRP ETF. Previously speaking at the Consensus 2024 conference, Garlinghouse declared that the introduction of an XRP Exchange Traded Fund (ETF) was inevitable.
XRP ETF Slated For 2025
In an exclusive interview with Fox Business on June 4, Garlinghouse offered insights on the current regulatory landscape of cryptocurrencies, emphasizing the recent approval of Ethereum Spot ETFs by the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and discussing the potential introduction of an XRP ETF. 

When asked if he believes that the Ethereum Spot ETFs will start trading by next month, Garlinghouse concurred, suggesting that Spot Ethereum ETFs could begin trading by July 2024.
He emphasized that the introduction of an Ethereum Spot ETF was “a big deal,” because it broadens market access for global investors. Additionally, he pointed to the successful launch of Spot Bitcoin ETFs, revealing that the digital asset has attracted billions in inflows, which underscores the strong demand and interest from investors in the asset class. 
Garlinghouse has predicted the imminent launch of an XRP ETF by 2025, emphasizing the fundamental similarities between Ethereum and XRP in terms of functionality and decentralization.
Speaking at the Consensus 2024 conference last week, the Ripple CEO asserted that an XRP ETF was inevitable. He revealed to Fox Business that the SEC’s approval of Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs paves the way for more cryptocurrency ETFs to enter the market soon. 
Garlinghouse also acknowledged that the US SEC might present challenges during the XRP ETF approval process. However, he remains confident that the regulator will ultimately authorize an XRP ETF.  
He noted that investors currently seek diversification rather than exposure to a single investment product. In the context of ETFs, this implies that the growing interest in more Spot Ethereum and Bitcoin ETFs could result in the approval of more crypto ETFs, including Solana, XRP, and Cardano. 
XRP Price Experienced Slight Uptick
During the interview, Garlinghouse was questioned about the possible factors behind the recent surge in several cryptocurrencies, such as Bitcoin, Ethereum, and XRP, over the past week. According to the interviewer, Bitcoin has surpassed $70,000, while Ethereum has experienced substantial inflows following the approval of Ethereum Spot ETFs. 

Additionally, CoinMarketCap data shows that XRP is seeing renewed momentum, witnessing a 1.17% increase in the last 24 hours and trading at a price of $0.52. Concerning this, Garlinghouse noted that the unexpected market momentum was largely driven by ongoing political developments in the United States. 
The Ripple CEO pointed out that despite its status as the largest global economy, the US has remained backwards in terms of cryptocurrency innovation and development. He disclosed that the recent support and attention given to the crypto industry by US Presidential candidate Donald Trump has been a welcome boost for the market.

ZK-Rollup Taiko Airdrops Token And Reaches $2 Billion Fully-Diluted Valuation - The Defiant

Roughly 50 million tokens, or 5% of the total supply, can now be claimed.
Taiko, a Layer 2 scaling network, started the first phase of its token distribution plans with the cryptocurrency launching at a fully diluted valuation (FDV) of $2.1 billion and a market capitalization of $110 million.The token has suffered a rocky start, however, dropping 40% to $2.20. Its token valuation makes it the 15th largest among Layer 2 networks in terms of market cap, and the 7th largest in terms of FDV.TAIKO Price - CoinGeckoTaiko is a rollup, which takes transactions and computation off the Ethereum mainnet to allow for faster and cheaper use. It uses “zero-knowledge” technology, which refers to a way of confirming transactions from the Layer 2 onto mainnet. The team also says the protocol is Ethereum-equivalent, which means it does not require any additional compiling, reaudits, or tooling to interact with the Ethereum blockchain.Airdrop ClaimersEligible users include Taiko proposers, which determine the transaction sequence in a block; provers, which prove a block’s transition from one state to another; bridgers, allowing for users to lock ETH and receive funds on Taiko, developers, Github contributors, and members of the DEX Loopring community.To claim tokens users first need to bridge ETH to Taiko to cover gas fees, the team wrote on X today. The claim window ends July 5.For users that did not qualify for this round's airdrop, Taiko has allocated 10% of the total supply to their upcoming Trailblazer program. The program looks to reward users that “explore” the ecosystem, and the project has established a number of special boosts for users engaging with the community and the protocol.

2 cryptocurrencies to reach $50 billion market cap in the second half of the year


    The cryptocurrency market in 2024 has seen a surge of activity, marked by significant rallies for major cryptocurrencies, approvals of Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) exchange-traded funds (ETFs), and the BTC halving event in April.



While the potential for increased capitalization largely depends on the broader recovery of the crypto market, several assets retain strong fundamentals likely to drive growth.



In this context, Finbold has identified two digital assets likely to reach a market cap of $50 billion by the second half of the year







XRP



XRP’s journey to a $50 billion market cap has been challenging, with its price remaining predominantly in a consolidated phase below the $1 mark. The token currently faces downward pressure from overall market sentiment, struggling to maintain support above the $0.55 threshold.



XRP  market cap. Source: CoinMarketCap



Despite its absence from the recent bull run, XRP is generating optimism due to recent legal advancements between Ripple Labs and the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).



Blockchainedbb, a crypto analyst on X, highlighted that XRP’s prolonged consolidation period, lasting over 700 days, could soon end in a significant breakout.



The analyst noted that XRP has been confined within a specific price range, notably around the $0.52 level, and this extended period of consolidation typically precedes substantial price movements. The potential breakout from this range is being closely monitored by investors and analysts alike, with many anticipating a notable rally.



Meanwhile, Ripple’s monthly token unlocks, alongside occasional additional sell-offs, could contribute to capitalization through inflation of the circulating supply.



As of press time, XRP is trading at $0.5291 and has a market capitalization of $29.34 billion, indicating that the token would need an upside of approximately 70% to reach $50 billion.



Dogecoin (DOGE)



Dogecoin (DOGE) has demonstrated potential and volatility, positioning it as a notable asset in the cryptocurrency space. Recent developments suggest a possibility of Dogecoin rallying soon. 



DOGE market cap. Source: CoinMarketCap



Dogecoin whales have shown increased interest in the leading meme coin, accumulating the cryptocurrency in the past few days. In a week, these highly capitalized investors added over 1 billion DOGE to their stack, worth $157 million.



A crypto trader, Kevin, has provided further insights into the technical indicators suggesting an imminent breakout for Dogecoin.



He highlighted the two-month Bollinger Bands Breakout indicator, which is signaling a major movement for the first time since November 2020. 



Additionally, the approaching two-month LMACD bullish cross points to significant upcoming price action. His analysis suggests that Dogecoin is preparing for a substantial move, similar to its past performance patterns.



Dogecoin also stands to benefit from its steadfast supporters, including Tesla (NASDAQ: TSLA) CEO Elon Musk, and associated products. 



At press time, Dogecoin is trading at $0.1631 and has a market capitalization of $23.58 billion, requiring an upside of approximately 112% to reach the $50 billion mark.



Both XRP and DOGE are strategically positioned to potentially achieve the $50 billion market cap milestone, driven by their ecosystem developments and the prevailing bullish sentiment in the market. 



However, the inherent volatility of the cryptocurrency market necessitates cautious investment. Investors should continuously monitor market trends and individual asset performance to capitalize on these opportunities effectively.

Ryan Salame is whitewashing his role at FTX and Alameda


Despite Ryan Salame pleading guilty to conspiracy to make unlawful political contributions and conspiracy to operate an unlicensed money transmitter, you wouldn’t be able to tell from his presence on X (formerly Twitter).
The former co-CEO of FTX Digital Markets is begging to be interviewed, providing political commentary, stating he’s ready to release a memoir, and denying much of his role at FTX and Alameda (despite his guilty plea).
Salame insists that there’s much more to the FTX and Alameda sagas, but hasn’t clarified what new information he has to provide and no one has publicly stated that they’ll be interviewing him. Nor has any publisher offered to publish his memoirs. So why has Salame returned to X and why is he talking so much?
It’s impossible to know what’s going on in the mind of Salame, but it’s obvious that he’s desperately seeking attention and is completely unrepentant for the crimes he committed and the individuals he harmed with his actions. It’s also worth noting that Salame was sentenced to 90 months in federal prison, his one intelligent move being that he didn’t open his enormous mouth before his sentence was decided.

First Step Act
Most nonviolent, first-time federal offenders are now extended an offer of early release through a Donald Trump-passed law called the First Step Act. The act allows criminals to take off as much as half of their sentence so they can be released into a halfway house or the home of a relative. This means that if Salame changes his attitude and behavior and instead chooses to act like a decent human being while behind bars, his 90-month sentence will be reduced to 45 months.
It’s important that everyone remember what Salame is guilty of and why he’s going to be spending years in prison.
Salame helped name the FTX-related company North Dimension so that it obscured the ultimate beneficial owner, he lied to a bank so that customer funds could be sent to the account he opened, he falsely claimed he wasn’t running a money transmitter, and he directed others to move customer funds into and out of bank accounts. Put simply, he helped steal from hundreds of thousands of people.
And none of that even touches on the real reason he’s going to be spending so much time behind bars: his insane straw donations to numerous politicians.
Salame ‘conspired with [SBF] to make [political] contributions [under his name]’ and a ‘private message to a confidant’ explained that the ‘bipartisan donations would be to weed out anti crypto dems for pro-crypto dems and anti-crypto repubs for pro-crypto repubs, and that donations would likely be routed through Salame ‘to weed out that republican side.’
Salame knew he was breaking the law, he knew that he was helping FTX and Alameda executives move money in illegal ways, and he knew that customer funds were moving through a supposed corporate account.
Now, he’s desperate to have you believe his side of the story but it’s important to remember that, like his co-workers and friends at the top tier of the FTX criminal syndicate, Salame is a liar and has no reason to share the truth with you or anyone else.

Paxos launches Lift Dollar (USDL), a unique overnight yield generating stablecoin - CoinJournal



                    

                    
The new Lift Dollar (USDL) stablecoin launched by Paxos offers daily yield from US government securities.
The USDL stablecoin is issued on Ethereum.
Currently the new stablecoin is accessible in the UAE, Europe, UK, and Japan.

Paxos International has introduced a revolutionary stablecoin, Lift Dollar (USDL), issued and regulated under the Abu Dhabi Global Market’s (ADGM) Financial Services Regulatory Authority (FSRA).
At its core, the USDL stablecoin offers unique overnight yield from US government securities, representing a significant innovation and democratizing access to interest earned from stablecoin reserves.
The unique features of the Lift Dollar (USDL)
Lift Dollar (USDL) is distinguished by its yield-generating capabilities, offering overnight yield from short-term, high-quality liquid US government securities and cash-equivalent reserve assets.
Unlike traditional stablecoins, USDL pays daily yield to token holders, reflecting the total value of the circulating USDL, which is fully backed by reserve assets.
This approach shifts the interest earned from stablecoin reserve assets directly from the central issuer to the appropriate end holders, democratizing access to financial gains typically reserved for institutional investors.
Furthermore, Paxos International will ensure USDL’s issuance is permissionless on the Ethereum blockchain, promoting transparency and accessibility. This permissionless issuance model allows for greater trust and ease of access for users.
Additionally, the design of USDL includes programmatic daily returns, likened to a savings product, offering users a consistent and predictable yield, distinguishing it from other stablecoins that function more like checking accounts.
Paxos’ regulatory compliance and strategic availability
Paxos has launched USDL through its UAE branch, Paxos International, adhering to stringent regulatory standards set by the ADGM’s FSRA. This compliance underscores Paxos’ commitment to regulatory adherence and financial security, positioning USDL as a reliable and secure investment option.
In addition, the assets backing USDL are kept safe from potential bankruptcy situations, ensuring that the value of the stablecoin remains robust and protected.
However, due to a lack of regulatory guidance in the US, USDL will not be available to American users. Instead, Paxos has strategically targeted regions including Europe, the United Kingdom, and Japan, where regulatory environments are more favorable.
This strategic move allows Paxos to tap into markets with significant demand for stable, yield-generating investment options, expanding its global footprint.
Paxos CEO Charles Cascarilla has emphasized that USDL is structured similarly to other stablecoins issued by Paxos, such as PayPal USD (PYUSD), Pax Dollar (USDP), and Pax Gold (PAXG). All these stablecoins are matched 1:1 to the dollar and backed by short-term US government securities, ensuring stability and trust.
With planned collaborations with exchanges and wallet service providers, Paxos aims to enhance the usage and accessibility of USDL, making it a significant player in the stablecoin market.

Jil Sander, Maison Margiela, and Marni Fashion Brands Adopt On-Chain Authentication - Decrypt

OTB, the international fashion and luxury group that owns brands like Jil Sander, Maison Margiela, and Marni, announced Wednesday that it will provide blockchain-based digital authenticity certificates for all products from those labels starting with the Fall/Winter 2024/2025 collections. The certificates utilize blockchain technology and an NFC (near-field communication) chip embedded in each garment or accessory. This allows customers to verify a product's authenticity by scanning the chip with their smartphone, accessing a tokenized certificate that’s stored as an NFT on a blockchain network."This is an important advance in the OTB innovation process, because it enables us to guarantee greater transparency, new ways of interaction, and an increasingly high-profile experience for our luxury brands' clients," said Stefano Rosso, Marni CEO and a board member of the Aura Blockchain Consortium, in a statement.OTB, a member of the Aura Consortium, has already registered about 1.2 million products with NFC chips on Aura's Ethereum-compatible blockchain network since early 2022. With the process now standardized across all luxury brands, OTB expects to register over 1.5 million products annually.OTB's Aura-powered authentication app in action. Image: OTB"Full-scale adoption of blockchain technology and its integration with our production processes means we shall be able to respond promptly to all the challenges and opportunities presented by future legislation," Rosso said.The Aura Consortium includes more than 40 leading luxury brands across multiple industries, including giants like Louis Vuitton, Prada, Mercedes Benz, and Tiffany & Co. More than 40 million products have been registered on its private chain to date, the Consortium announced in May.The Aura platform lets brands enable not only digital authentication functionality, but also the ability for brands to directly engage with customers and for people to transfer on-chain ownership of items.Editor’s note: This article was written with the assistance of AI.

Germans In The Dark On Digital Euro: Survey Reveals Confusion Over New Currency | Bitcoinist.com


								A recent survey by Germany’s central bank, the Deutsche Bundesbank, reveals a surprising openness among Germans towards the digital euro, the European Central Bank’s (ECB) proposed digital currency. However, the survey also exposes a significant knowledge gap that needs to be addressed before the system’s potential can be fully realized.

While a staggering three-fifths (60%) of Germans surveyed admitted to having never encountered information about the digital euro, half (50%) expressed a willingness to potentially use it if offered as an additional payment option. This openness, despite a lack of familiarity, suggests a public appetite for innovation in the payments landscape.

Misconceptions Cloud Curiosity
However, the survey also paints a picture of confusion surrounding the digital euro. Nearly a third of respondents (30%) mistakenly believed it would replace cash entirely, highlighting the need for clear and concise public education efforts. The ECB has repeatedly emphasized that the digital euro would be complementary to cash, offering a secure and convenient alternative for digital transactions.
Source: Deutsche Bundesbank
Privacy emerged as the single most important factor for Germans considering the digital euro. Over three-quarters (76%) deemed strong privacy protections “very important” or “important.” This concern likely stems from the ever-present issue of data privacy in the digital age. The ECB assures users that their data will be far more secure with the digital euro than with existing commercial payment solutions.
Building Trust In A Digital Future
The survey results underline the importance of comprehensive public information campaigns, stated Burkhard Balz, Bundesbank board member responsible for the digital euro project. Balz added that under the current plans, people would be able to make their first payments with the digital euro no earlier than 2028.

As of today, the market cap of cryptocurrencies stood at $2.5 trillion. Chart: TradingView.com
The ECB is aiming to bridge this knowledge gap through a multi-pronged approach. Public information campaigns will explain the concept of the digital euro, emphasizing its role as a complement to cash, not a replacement. Additionally, the ECB is committed to building a system that prioritizes user privacy. They claim that transaction details will be known only to the payer and the payee, with no unnecessary data collection by authorities.

Digital Euro: The Road To 2028
Currently, the digital euro is in its initial phase, with a focus on finalizing regulations and exploring potential distribution channels. This preparation phase is expected to conclude in October 2025. Germans, and Europeans as a whole, shouldn’t anticipate utilizing the digital euro for everyday transactions until at least 2028, according to Bundesbank estimates.

Ethereum Creator Vitalik Buterin Explains What Celebrity Tokens Get Wrong - Decrypt

We do the research, you get the alpha!Get exclusive reports and access to key insights on airdrops, NFTs, and more! Subscribe now to Alpha Reports and up your game!Go to Alpha ReportsVitalik Buterin has a problem with the latest spate of celebrity meme coins, taking to Twitter to rail against pop culture-powered cryptocurrencies—and explaining how they could regain credibility.The problem, Buterin emphasized, was not with meme coins as a caategory, but instead the fact that most don’t serve a purpose beyond making money.“I'm feeling quite unhappy about with ‘this cycle’s celebrity experimentation,’ so far,” he wrote. “‘Financialization as a means toward an end’ I can respect if the end is worthy—healthcare, open source software, art, etc.”The tweet came in response to a post by Placeholder VC partner and author Chris Burniske about the Mother Iggy (MOTHER) token. The Solana-based meme coin was launched in May by Australian rapper and model Iggy Azalea.Meme coins refer to cryptocurrencies based on internet memes, such as current events like elections, and celebrities. Currently, MOTHER is trading at $0.10, up 11.7% for the day and 520.3% for the last seven days, according to CoinGecko.Buterin referenced the Stoner Cats NFTs backed by Hollywood stars Ashton Kutcher and Mila Kunis in 2021 as more worthy examples.“Ashton and Mila's Stoner Cats was vastly more honorable than anything we've seen from this 2024 celebrity memecoin era,“ Buterin said. “At least there was an actual show being funded.”Buterin also shared recommendations for future celebrity meme coins, including setting a goal that serves the public good rather than simply enriching early adopters. He also said there should be more creativity in what holders of the coin can do.“As much as I dislike token voting DAOs, at least they give something for people to do and organize around,” he said. “The DAO should not fully decide the agenda, but it can have some influence.”Finally, Buterin said the project should have a long-term roadmap.“Make something that lasts 10+ years, rather than bubbling around for a few months and then being forgotten,” Buterin said.Meme coins exist on many different blockchains—including the original meme coin Dogecoin. Solana, however, has seen a surge in meme coins this year, including two based on the upcoming U.S. presidential election: Jeo Boden (BODEN), named after Pres. Joe Biden, and Doland Tremp (TREMP), named for his presumed rival.Pointing to a March 2024 blog post where he shared similar advice, Buterin reiterated that a meme coin project’s “north star” should be where—even if the tokens go to zero—participants are still happy to have been a part of the experience.“Regular businesses and charities accomplish this goal all the time,” he said. “It's a low bar, but things we build should meet this bar as well.”Edited by Ryan Ozawa.Daily Debrief NewsletterStart every day with the top news stories right now, plus original features, a podcast, videos and more.

IOTA has launched its L2 EVM network focusing on real-world asset usage - CoinJournal



                    

                    
IOTA launches layer 2 EVM network, integrating real-world assets and boosting DeFi.
The newly launched EVM network features smart contracts, cross-chain capabilities, and MEV protection.
IOTA token has seen a 3.23% increase to $0.2352 following the EVM network launch.

IOTA has launched its layer 2 Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) network focused on the integration and tokenization of real-world assets (RWAs).
Besides revolutionizing the IOTA ecosystem, the L2 EVM network offers robust functionalities tailored to meet the needs of both individual users and institutional investors.
Features of IOTA’s L2 EVM network
The new L2 EVM network introduces advanced features such as smart contracts, cross-chain capabilities, and parallel processing. These enhancements are designed to facilitate the seamless operation of decentralized financial (DeFi) applications and enable the efficient tokenization of physical assets.
A notable aspect of this network is its built-in protections against Maximal Extractable Value (MEV), a predatory practice where network validators manipulate transaction order to extract higher fees.
By preventing such activities, IOTA aims to create a more secure and equitable environment for all participants.
Dominik Schiener, co-founder of IOTA, in a Telegram message emphasized the network’s potential to bring vast amounts of real-world assets on-chain. Dominik said:
“We are positioning IOTA to bring the real world to Web3 and help to bring trillions of assets and institutional investors on-chain.” 
Dominik’s ambition is supported by the establishment of the IOTA Ecosystem DLT Foundation, the first distributed ledger technology foundation registered under Abu Dhabi Global Market (ADGM) regulations.
This regulatory compliance ensures that IOTA is well-equipped to cater to the requirements of institutional investors, including features like on-chain KYC to identify investors and facilitate institutional DeFi trading pools.
Parallel processing is another key feature of the new L2 EVM network, enabling multiple transactions to be processed simultaneously. This approach significantly enhances the network’s scalability, reduces gas costs, and increases transaction speeds, addressing some of the most pressing challenges faced by blockchain networks today.
IOTA price reaction
Following the launch of the layer 2 EVM network, the IOTA token has experienced a notable uptick.
At press time, the IOTA token price was $0.2352, marking a 3.23% increase in the last 24 hours. The market capitalization stood at $773,040,069, reflecting a 3.27% rise. In addition, over the past 24 hours, the trading volume has surged by 25.71%, reaching $20,353,145.
However, the current price of is a far cry from its all-time high of $5.69, achieved in December 2017.
Despite the fluctuations, the recent developments and strategic focus on real-world asset usage points to a promising future for the token.

Why AI Needs Crypto’s Values | Bankless


The tech industry's dreams of an AI revolution has always been a double-edged sword. Unleashing AI could solve humanity’s biggest challenges, but it could also concentrate power in dangerous ways.That's where crypto and blockchain come in. The same values that make crypto cool can help make AI better. These values can help build a fairer, safer, and more open future for AI.Decentralization, permissionless innovation, open source systems, privacy, transparency, user ownership. These aren’t just fancy words; they can potentially crack open the black box of AI. Here’s why the AI industry needs crypto’s magic 👇Building an Inclusive and Open-Source AI EcosystemThe synergies between AI and crypto. Source: The promise and challenges of crypto + AI applicationsA few big tech companies currently control most of the computing power and are building moats around their AI research. This has created an 'AI mafia' that stifles innovation and competition faster than you can say "walled garden.”Decentralization, however, is the ultimate plot twist.In the decentralized AI paradigm, there’s permissionless access to computing power and AI research. AI becomes a tool for everyone, breaking down the barriers set by the AI mafia and democratizing access to knowledge, tools, and resources. Sharing resources means more people can work on AI's toughest challenges. The more diverse the builders, the less biased the algorithms, and that's a win for everyone.
However, open-source development has always been hard to monetize. How do you get people to build great things if they can't earn from it? This often forces companies to go closed-source and for-profit. ‘Decentralized AI with crypto incentives’ fixes this.Crypto offers new ways to monetize open-source AI. It creates an open marketplace for AI development, ensuring access and rewarding contributions with tokens.For example, in decentralized AI networks like Bittensor, developers earn TAO tokens for their machine learning models when used in different AI applications.This dynamic allows decentralized AI networks to attract top talent through tokenized incentives, creating a sustainable value chain that doesn't exist in closed-source, centralized models.Ensuring Privacy of User DataWe live in a data-hungry world. Everyone wants your data to learn about your likes and dislikes and then use it to sell you things.AI is no different. AI systems need lots of data to work well. Big AI companies often store entire conversation histories to train their models and improve services, but this creates a huge privacy issue.Imagine all your personal info – shopping habits, browsing history, even health records – being thrown into a big AI pot. You have to trust the company not to misuse or sell it. Scary, right?To truly gain user trust, AI needs to embrace privacy-preserving techniques. Building trust requires transparency and verifiability, and zero-knowledge proofs (ZKPs) can help with that.There are also other ways AI projects in crypto are adopting privacy-preserving techniques. For example, Venice.ai stores conversation history only in the user's browser and ensures user requests are encrypted. GPU providers process these requests, but no server sees the entire conversation history or knows the user's identity.We can create AI systems that respect user privacy and data ownership by integrating these cryptographic approaches and values.VIDEOHow do we train AI models while maintaining privacy but without using user data? Without enough data, AI can't understand real-world situations well, leading to 'AI hallucinations' where the AI generates incorrect outputs.This is where synthetic data comes in. Synthetic data is artificially generated using algorithms to mimic real data. It has privacy-preserving qualities because it doesn't expose personal information. All major AI companies use it, and it's an emerging area of research.Crypto can incentivize the creation of synthetic datasets for training AI models by crowd-sourcing the work. Users can earn tokens for contributing verified data points, solving the problem of insufficient training data. For example, projects like Synthetic AI build tools for creating synthetic data, allowing users to contribute synthetic data and earn SAI tokens. Ensuring the quality of these datasets can significantly accelerate efforts to generate data for training AI models while maintaining user data privacy.Closing ThoughtsThe future of AI is uncertain, but one thing's for sure: it needs to be built on an open-source foundation of trust and transparency. Crypto, with its focus on decentralized ownership, permissionless access, and privacy, offers the missing piece. The tools are there, and it's time to use them and write the next chapter of the story of AI.Can crypto's values improve the AI industry? Comment below and let us know your thoughts!This is the AI x Crypto Cycle on BanklessAI x Crypto is real. The fundamentals are there & so is the speculative degeneracy.

Over 40% of Bitcoin (BTC) Supply Now Held by This Group of Whale Addresses


																Since mid-March, there has been a notable trend of large bitcoin holders or “whales” stashing more tokens.
The latest data suggest that a particular cohort of whale addresses now collectively own more than 40% of the total bitcoin supply.
Whales Gobble Up Bitcoin Supply
The accumulation of bitcoin by large holders or “whales” holding over 1,000 BTC has been a notable trend since mid-March. According to IntoTheBlock’s tweet, addresses with over 1,000 BTC now collectively own more than 40% of the total bitcoin supply.


This concentration of ownership signals increased confidence and conviction among wealthy investors and institutions in BTC’s future price trajectory as investor sentiment remains bullish on the top asset.




Historically, such accumulation by large holders has often preceded significant price rallies, as it reduces the circulating supply and increases scarcity.
The steady accumulation by whales suggests they anticipate bitcoin’s value to continue appreciating, which could attract further institutional adoption and drive the next bull run.
Spot ETFs’ Global Hype
The development comes as investors continue to actively invest in spot Bitcoin ETFs, with Wednesday marking the strongest inflow day since March. This surge in interest coincides with BTCtrading above $71,000. These investment vehicles, which received regulatory approval from the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) in January, have played a crucial role in legitimizing and facilitating activity in the market.
According to data from Farside, spot Bitcoin ETFs witnessed inflows exceeding $886 million on Tuesday. Fidelity’s FBTC attracted the highest inflows of $378 million, followed by BlackRock’s IBIT, which saw an inflow of $270 million. Notably, Grayscale’s GBTC, which has historically experienced outflows, also attracted $28 million from investors.
Investor confidence in Bitcoin and the broader market has been boosted by a series of positive developments globally. Last month, Hong Kong gave the green light to Bitcoin ETFs, while Australia welcomed its first BTC ETF earlier this week. Additionally, the SEC approved eight spot Ether ETFs in a landmark decision last month.
More recently, the Thai Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) approved One Asset Management, a local firm, to introduce Thailand’s first spot Bitcoin ETF.

This sharp decline in share price has raised questions among investors about whether this dip represents a buying opportunity.Kerrisdale Capital Is Short Riot StockAdrangi's analysis criticized Riot Platforms, highlighting that the $3-billion company derives more of its value from energy arbitrage and stock issuance rather than actual Bitcoin BTC/USD mining.Adrangi’s report argues that Bitcoin mining is among the least favorable business models for a public company. The issues cited include unpredictable revenue streams, high capital expenditure requirements, intense competition, the commodity nature of Bitcoin, and mounting regulatory scrutiny, even in traditionally crypto-friendly regions like Texas, where Riot operates.Riot clapped back against Adrangi in a prepared statement to Benzinga. “We disagree with the characterization of the Bitcoin mining industry and of Riot, and the equally unsound conclusions reached in the Kerrisdale Capital report,” the company stated. “We believe these errors will be demonstrated through the execution of our ambitious 2024 growth plans and resulting financial performance.”More on the report here: Riot Platforms Targeted by Kerrisdale Capital’s Short Sell Report: DetailsKey Indicators Suggest A Strongly Bearish TrendThe technical indicators for Riot’s stock currently suggest a strongly bearish trend. The share price is trading below its 5, 20, and 50-day exponential moving averages, which collectively indicate significant selling pressure and the potential for further declines.Chart: Benzinga Pro
Short-term Indicators: RIOT's current share price of $9.24 is below its eight-day simple moving average (SMA) of $9.88, signaling bearish trader sentiments. Additionally, the 20-day SMA stands at $10.05, reinforcing this bearish outlook.



Medium-term Indicators: The stock price remains below the 50-day SMA of $10.25, another technical signal indicating a continued bearish recommendation.



Long-term Indicators: The 200-day SMA is at $11.67, substantially higher than the current price, suggesting a long-term bearish outlook as well.
Chart: Benzinga Pro
MACD Indicator: The Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) indicator stands at -0.22, further suggesting that Riot Platforms is under selling pressure.



RSI Indicator: The Relative Strength Index (RSI) is at 40.12, with Riot Platforms’ stock treading towards the oversold territory but not yet at a level that typically signals a strong buying opportunity.



Bollinger Bands: The Bollinger Bands (20) ranging from $9.12 to $10.97, suggest the stock is trading on the lower end, reinforcing the bearish signal.
Buying The Dip? Caution AdvisedGiven the current technical landscape and Kerrisdale Capital’s bearish outlook, Riot Platforms appears to be facing substantial downward pressure. The combination of adverse market sentiment and unfavorable technical indicators suggests that investors should approach Riot’s stock with caution.While the notion of a “buy-the-dip” opportunity may appeal to some, the bearish signals from the moving averages, MACD, and RSI indicate that RIOT stock is more likely to continue its downward trajectory in the near term. Investors considering entering the market at this stage should be prepared for potential further declines and should closely monitor any shifts in technical indicators and market sentiment.Read Next: BlackRock's Bitcoin ETF Up 50% Since Launch: Indicators Point To Continued BTC Bull RunImage: Shutterstock

Biden’s Surprise Veto Signals Democrats’ Crypto-Friendly Era May Have Been Wishful Thinking - The Defiant

Experts say Biden’s latest move against crypto could cost him the 2024 election.
Many thought the Biden administration was warming up to cryptocurrencies after the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) green-lighting Ethereum ETFs, while the Financial Innovation and Technology for the 21st Century (FIT 21) bill gained bipartisan support and Biden walked back a decision to veto it.But it was short lived.Things took a surprising turn when U.S. President Joe Biden put his foot down, vetoing legislation designed to dismantle the SEC's Staff Accounting Bulletin (SAB) No.121 rule, even as 11 Democrats voted for it, joining 48 Republicans.This move has left the crypto community questioning Biden's and the Democratic party’s support.“Snatching defeat from the jaws of victory,” Galaxy Digital’s Mike Novogratz said. “The [Democrats] were trying to defuse [Donald] Trump being the crypto president and were doing a great job. But this doesn’t help at all. Whoever is advising Biden needs to have his head examined.”Prevent Misconduct SAB 121 requires financial institutions holding crypto assets to record them as liabilities, ensuring that these entities keep a one-to-one reserve of different assets and maintain stringent internal records. The rule makes it tough and pricey for banks to offer large-scale crypto custody services.Biden, however, insisted that this accounting guidance was necessary to protect customers and prevent financial misconduct. In a statement, he mentioned that his administration aims to work with Congress on a “comprehensive and balanced” crypto regulation framework.It Will Cost HimThe crypto community wasn’t pleased."We are disappointed that Biden chose to override the bipartisan majorities in both Houses of Congress who acknowledged the harm caused by SAB 121,” Dan Spuller, vice president of the Blockchain Association said.Anthony Scaramucci from Skybridge Capital didn’t mince his words.“[Biden’s] position on crypto may cost him more than he realizes,” Scaramucci tweeted. “It was a really bad decision to veto that bill. Especially at this critical time.”Crypto lawyer Pablo Enrique weighed in, saying, “With Biden vetoing even against recommendations of the banking industry, it’s hard to see that he passes anything really solid regarding crypto.”Political ForceOf the 335.89 million U.S. residents, an estimated 50 million eligible voters are crypto enthusiasts. Crypto ownership is notably high among younger demographics, with over 40% of men aged 18-54 and more than 30% of African Americans and Hispanics owning cryptocurrencies in 2024.The growing crypto-holding demographic, plus sizable lobbying efforts with organizations such as from Coinbase, Blockchain Association, and Crypto Council for Innovation, means the once fringe blockchain industry is becoming a powerful political force​.Trump’s GainDonald Trump has tried to position himself as the pro-crypto candidate, taking a U-turn on his views on cryptocurrency. In May, Trump’s campaign accepted crypto donations, expressed support for commuting Ross Ulbricht’s sentence, and promised to keep crypto innovators in the U.S.According to the crypto-betting marketplace Polymarket, despite his conviction on May 30, Trump is predicted to win the upcoming election in November. As of the latest data, Trump's chances of winning are at 56%, while Biden's are at 37%.Glimmer of HopeStill the passing of FIT 21, which aims to create a comprehensive legal and regulatory framework for cryptocurrencies and digital assets, provides a glimmer of hope for the crypto industry that it is getting more bi-partisan support.The bill passed in the House with a vote of 279 to 136, and the Senate with a vote of 60 to 38. Notably, 135 Democrats in the House supported FIT 21, while 27 Democrats in the Senate voted in favor.This level of Democratic support for a cryptocurrency-related bill is substantial compared to previous crypto bills.Bills like the Token Taxonomy Act (2018) and the Crypto-Currency Act of 2020 had minimal Democratic support, with fewer than 10 and 5 Democratic co-sponsors, respectively.But for some experts like Joe Vezzani, CEO, LunarCrush, it doesn’t really matter if Biden is pro or against crypto.“I’m not worried about the short-term effects that Biden will have on the industry,” he told The Defiant. “The industry will continue to grow and flourish with or without the support of these people, like it always did."

‘Hamster Kombat’ Daily Cipher Guide: How to Use Morse Code to Earn a Million Free Coins in the Telegram Game - Decrypt

If you’re playing Hamster Kombat on Telegram, then you’re surely trying to rack up as many in-game coins as possible ahead of the token launch on The Open Network (TON) and accompanying airdrop. The daily combo is a solid option, but now there’s another way to bank a million free tokens every single day.The daily cipher is a new addition that lets you tap a specific daily term in Morse code and immediately get one million free in-game coins. It’s as simple as that—although we’ll see whether the game gets craftier about conveying the daily message to players.Here’s how to enter the daily cipher code to earn your free coins, and where to find it.What is the daily cipher?Introduced on June 5, Hamster Kombat’s daily cipher offers engaged players 1 million free tokens daily. It was teased via a post on the game’s official Telegram channel, along with a string of Morse code displayed on the Telegram mini app’s loading screen (it literally read “LOADING”).There’s a specific input method, though, so here’s what you need to know.To begin the process, tap the “Earn per tap” box three times on the main screen. This will change the background of your hamster icon to red, and a “Daily Cipher” box will appear below your earnings meter. Now you’re set to enter the code.The very first term for June 5 was “BTC” (aka Bitcoin), and it’s inputted through the following Morse code string: long hold and then three quick taps (B), long hold (T), and finally a long hold followed by a tap, another long hold, and another tap (C).Screenshots from Hamster Kombat. Image: DecryptEach letter is displayed on the screen after it’s accurately entered, so you’ll know whether you’ve got it right. It took us a few tries to nail the cadence, but eventually we were able to input “BTC” with Morse code and net the free coins. Easy as that.How do you find the daily cipher?The daily cipher will be reset at 7pm UTC each day going forward, according to an official YouTube video, which is also where Hamster Kombat revealed that the first code was indeed “BTC.”But people had already discovered this ahead of the video launch, whether through trial and error or perhaps clues shared elsewhere. As of this writing, that’s not immediately clear—and since it’s still the first day, we don’t know for sure whether Hamster Kombat will overtly share future codes.In the meantime, you’ll likely be able to find the new daily cipher by searching on social media, like Twitter (aka X) or TikTok, similar to how the daily combo is often easy to locate soon after the morning changeover. If we find a more reliable way to discover the daily cipher, we’ll add it here in a future update.Edited by Ryan Ozawa.GG NewsletterGet the latest web3 gaming news, hear directly from gaming studios and influencers covering the space, and receive power-ups from our partners.

Popular Analyst Predicts Dogecoin Will Outperform Bitcoin As Market Enters Meme Coin Super Cycle


																Crypto analyst Crypto Kaleo has laid out a bullish narrative for Dogecoin (DOGE), revealing how well the foremost meme coin could perform in this bull run. He also suggested that there was no need to worry about Dogecoin’s current price action, which paints a bearish outlook for the meme coin. 
Dogecoin Will Outpace Bitcoin In This Market Cycle
Crypto Kaleo mentioned in an X (formerly Twitter) post that he has “an insanely high conviction” that Dogecoin will “outpace” Bitcoin in this market cycle. He made this statement while revealing that he is also bullish on the flagship crypto. Given how high Bitcoin is expected to rise in this bull run, this undoubtedly paints an ultra-bullish narrative for the foremost meme coin.

Source: X
From the chart he shared, Crypto Kaleo predicts that Dogecoin could rise over 200% against its Bitcoin pair and climb to as high as $0.55. He is convinced that Dogecoin can make such a run because he claims the market is in a “meme super cycle.”As such, he remarked that the “king of memes won’t be left behind.”
Despite this being a meme super cycle like Crypto Kaleo claims, Dogecoin’s price has continued to lag compared to other meme coins. However, the analyst suggested that DOGE’s current price action is normal, stating that the meme coin “moves sideways for extended periods, followed by rapid vertical growth.”
In an earlier X post, the analyst suggested that this “rapid vertical growth” could happen once GameStop’s (GME) stock tops. He drew a correlation between both assets, noting that Dogecoin’s price rallied in the 2021 bull run after GME topped. He expects something similar to happen this time, especially with Roaring Kitty’s return.
Meanwhile, Crypto Kaleo isn’t the only one who believes that Dogecoin can outperform Bitcoin in this market cycle. Crypto analyst Don Alt also seems to hold this belief as he previously suggested that Dogecoin was a better investment than Bitcoin based on his claim that Dogecoin can rise to as high as $2 in this bull run. 
DOGE Going To Go Parabolic Later This Year
Crypto analyst Altcoin Sherpa has also offered a bullish narrative for Dogecoin. In a recent X post, he stated that the foremost meme coin “is going to do something stupid later this year,” suggesting that a parabolic rise was on the horizon for Dogecoin. He added that Dogecoin is still one of the “safest trades” anyone can make in this cycle.

He also seems to believe that Dogecoin can outperform Bitcoin in this cycle, noting in another X post that Dogecoin was one of the few altcoins that increased and held above their Bitcoin pair in the 2021 bull run. He added that these altcoins “are for this cycle” and that crypto investors should keep this in mind.

Bitcoin Breaks $71,000 As Coinbase Premium Sees Green Spike


								The Bitcoin price has observed a surge back above the $71,000 level during the past day as buyers appear to have returned on Coinbase.
Bitcoin Coinbase Premium Has Witnessed A Large Positive Spike
As explained by CryptoQuant author Axel Adler Jr in a post on X, the BTC Coinbase Premium Index has registered a high value recently. The “Coinbase Premium Index” refers to an indicator that keeps track of the percentage difference between the Bitcoin prices listed on Coinbase (USD pair) and Binance (USDT pair).
When the value of this metric is positive, it means the price of the cryptocurrency listed on Coinbase is greater than on Binance right now. Such a trend implies the presence of a higher buying pressure (or just a lower selling pressure) on the former exchange than the latter one.

On the other hand, the indicator being negative implies a larger amount of selling may be occurring on Coinbase than on Binance at the moment, which has pushed the price on the former to a lower value.
Now, here is a chart that shows the trend in the Bitcoin Coinbase Premium Index over the last few weeks:

The value of the indicator seems to have spiked quite high recently | Source: @AxelAdlerJr on X
As displayed in the above graph, the Bitcoin Coinbase Premium Index has been mostly at negative levels during the past couple of weeks. Prior to this red streak, the metric had seen a phase of positive levels. Interestingly, the price of the cryptocurrency had marched up alongside those green values. This would imply that the buying pressure on Coinbase may have helped fuel the rally.
Coinbase is widely known to be the preferred platform of the US-based institutional entities, while Binance hosts a more global traffic. As such, the index’s value can provide hints about how the behavior of these American whales differs from the rest of the world.
This year, these institutional investors have taken the center stage in the Bitcoin market with the approval of the spot exchange-traded funds (ETFs), with their movements reflecting on the BTC price. The earlier pattern of the potential buying pressure from these large American investors driving the rally is just one example of this trend seen at different points in the year.
As mentioned before, what has followed this accumulation has been negative values of the Coinbase Premium Index in the past two weeks or so. While this selling pressure hasn’t caused any significant bearish effects on Bitcoin, the coin has still been unable to mount any further upward moves.
One glimmer of hope, perhaps, may have appeared in the past day, as the indicator has registered a large positive spike. It’s unclear currently whether this is going to lead to another buying streak like last month or if it’s just a temporary deviation like the two short-lived spikes already witnessed in the past week.

Whatever the case be, though, Bitcoin has been able to enjoy some bullish momentum in the last 24 hours, likely at least in part because of this buying pressure.
BTC Price
In this latest fresh surge, Bitcoin has so far been able to climb towards the $71,300 level. It now only remains to be seen how long this run can continue.

Complexity of Ethereum Driving Solana To Find Product Market Fit, According to Anatoly Yakovenko - The Daily Hodl


								Ethereum’s (ETH) complexity brings Solana’s (SOL) mission into focus, according to Anatoly Yakovenko.
The Solana co-founder says in a new interview on Bankless that his mission is simply building a hyperfast chain.










[1:49:29] “Yeah, network effects, TVL (total value locked), all these things could matter, but it’s not hard. It’s not something that I can bet my work on, that I would want to bet my career on. I want to build stuff that I know is going to work. 
So from my perspective, the more L2s (layer-2s) and networks and different environments there are for digital assets the better, because the more of that stuff that exists, the easier it is for a price discovery engine that runs as fast as the speed of light allows to actually find product market fit. There’s just more stuff to do price discovery on. 
So, please, go build as many L2s as you can. Build as many ultrasound monies as you can. Go forth. We’re going to build a chain that runs as fast as physics allows given the hardware gods and where they go.”
SOL is trading at $173.10 at time of writing. The 5th-ranked crypto asset by market cap is up more than 4% in the past 24 hours.

Gary Gensler Says Crypto Exchanges Are Doing What the NYSE Would ‘Never Be Allowed to Do’ - The Daily Hodl


								The Chair of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) says that crypto exchanges are doing what the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) would never be allowed to do.
In a new interview on CNBC’s Squawk Box, SEC Chair Gary Gensler says that crypto exchange platforms are not giving investors the proper disclosures required by the law and could be trading against consumers.










“Right now, without prejudging anyone, these tokens have not given you the disclosures that you not only need to make your investment decisions but also that are required by the law. 
It’s a basic concept in our securities markets… and what President Roosevelt did is he created this commission to oversee that you, the investors, get disclosure, and in the crypto markets, they aren’t giving you that disclosure. 
And secondly that exchanges, like the floor of the New York Stock Exchanges, get properly regulated to protect against fraud and manipulation, and they don’t trade against you. And these crypto exchanges are doing things we would never allow the New York Stock Exchange to do. Our laws don’t allow you to trade against your customers.” 
Gensler also touched on the approval of spot Ethereum (ETH) exchange-traded funds (ETFs), noting that deciding on launching the ETH ETFs could take some time, but didn’t give any specific dates.
“Ethereum has been traded on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange for three+ years and the staff looked at that closely and that was approved. Now the underlying exchange-traded products still need to go through a process to have a disclosure about that and that will take some time and they’re working on that.” 
The SEC approved Bitcoin (BTC) ETFs in January, paving the way for billions of dollars worth of inflows for the top crypto asset by market cap.

JPMorgan Analysts Announced: "The Event That Could Shift the Balance in Bitcoin (BTC) Mining is Near" - Bitcoin Sistemi


JPMorgan highlighted in a recent research report that Bitcoin (BTC) mining companies with attractive energy contracts could make interesting acquisition targets. This comes at a time when hyperscalers and artificial intelligence (AI) companies are exploring different alternatives to secure their energy needs.
The mining industry is witnessing a surge in mergers and acquisitions, especially after the Bitcoin halving. Shares of Core Scientific (CORZ) rose on Tuesday after cloud computing firm CoreWeave signed a 200-megawatt (MW) AI deal with Bitcoin mining. CoreWeave has also reportedly made an all-cash offer to acquire the company. In another development, Riot Platforms (RIOT), another major Bitcoin miner, made an aggressive bid to acquire peer Bitfarms (BITF) last month.


According to JPMorgan, Core Scientific news will be most impactful for Iris Energy (IREN), which is an early adopter of HPC and has rights to develop over 2 gigawatts (GW) of power.
JPMorgan suggests that this deal could raise the “valuation base for subscale mining operators” as a new customer class, Hyperscalers, emerges. The bank also added that it could help “rationalize the Bitcoin network” by shifting power capacity away from miners, thus increasing the profits of the remaining operators.





The bank estimates that US-listed Bitcoin miners draw up to 5 GW of power and have access to an additional 2.5 GW, making them potentially attractive targets. Additionally, some Bitcoin miners who are under financial pressure to exit the market following the recent halving event may be more open to a deal.

GameStop Pumps 16% as SEC Chair Gensler Sidesteps Roaring Kitty Question - Decrypt

We do the research, you get the alpha!Get exclusive reports and access to key insights on airdrops, NFTs, and more! Subscribe now to Alpha Reports and up your game!Go to Alpha ReportsGameStop shares popped 16% to over $31 on Wednesday after Gary Gensler, chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), was asked about Keith Gill.Better known online as Roaring Kitty or DeepFuckingValue, the meme stock influencer was brought up by the hosts of CNBC’s Mad Money. Before they could finish asking a question about Gill’s online return, Gensler interrupted to address the show’s audience directly.Describing the SEC as a cop on the beat, Gensler said the agency investigates the behavior of financial market participants as one might expect. But, “following the facts and the law,” he said the agency would only speak publicly about a matter if it was being brought before a court.“Generally speaking, you have to make sure you don’t mislead the public, and that you don’t, in any way, do things in the markets that may be manipulative,” Gensler said, declining to say whether the SEC is currently scrutinizing Gill’s trading or online behavior.Gill’s social media posts and recently purchased GameStop (GME) holdings have caught the attention of the SEC, as well as the securities regulator in Massachusetts.Kicking off his online return with an image of a man leaning forward in a chair on Twitter last month, Mad Money host Jim Cramer posited that Gill could’ve been sending gamers a coded message.“We know from video game playing, [that] means: come on, this is the ninth inning, get ready,” Cramer said. “Is this something, hypothetically, that the SEC should worry about?”While solidly up for the day, GameStop shares exhibited some irregular trading activity. While the stock traded at around $29.10 on Wednesday afternoon, it dipped momentarily to $26.27, a 10% decrease that was quickly reversed in the midst of the trading day.While Gill’s Twitter presence drew chatter on Wednesday, the meme stock influencer has recently resurfaced on Reddit too. Echoing his “YOLO updates” where he posted GameStop positions in 2021, Gill has posted his purported holdings on the platform twice so far this week.Gill’s Reddit account, however, was silent on Tuesday. In his most recent post, a screengrab suggested that Gill owns $289 million in GameStop shares and call options. Overall, the positions shown had increased by over $85 million in value.Edited by Ryan Ozawa.Daily Debrief NewsletterStart every day with the top news stories right now, plus original features, a podcast, videos and more.

RWA industry still faces regulatory and infrastructure challenges, says eSync executive - Crypto Briefing


            
            
                            
            
                            
            
            The tokenized US Treasuries market surpassed the $1.5 billion market on June 4th and serves as an important metric on how tokenization of real-world assets (RWA) is growing as an industry. Nevertheless, this market is still distant from its traditional counterpart, as the US government sold a record $23 trillion in Treasuries last year, as reported by the Wall Street Journal.For Sally Meouche-Ghrawi, an executive from the RWA-focused infrastructure eSync Network, the relatively small size of the tokenization industry can be tied to the infrastructure and regulatory landscape. “There are many risks when it comes to real-world asset tokenization, and these risks are usually off-chain. The digitalization process is fairly straightforward, what comes before that is more questionable, which is the off-chain formalization,” she explained. “This is affected by factors such as the legal framework, the different market prices, and the historical performances of assets.”Additionally, the process of onboarding institutional investors in RWA tokenization hits a wall when it comes to proper infrastructure to adequately support them. Although Sally highlighted that significant developments have been made in the RWA industry, such as interoperability solutions developed by Chainlink and Axelar, those services still have their issues when it comes to onboarding different institutions.“First it’s because of trust issues, and then it’s because of understanding. And then how do you provide the proper infrastructure and security within a specific legal and regulatory framework to maneuver this? So there are a lot of moving parts when it comes to the RWA tokenization process. And this needs time, I guess, for the markets to mature, but also for the technology and the infrastructure to be more favorable.”Onboarding regular Joes and JanesThe RWA industry has seen the entrance of significant traditional institutions, such as Franklin Templeton and, more recently, the largest asset manager in the world BlackRock. This makes the market competitive and challenging for new projects.However, Sally stated that eSync is not looking to compete with those goliaths since they are not focused on onboarding decentralized finance and Web3-experienced users, even though they are a desirable audience.“I think that the RWA market itself is quite big enough, and it’s going to only grow further and further within the coming months and years. When it comes to what we’re doing, I would say that we’re focusing on specific niche use cases and we are focusing on a specific target audience. When it comes to the specific target audience we are targeting, I’m talking about the average Joes and Janes out there.”Therefore, eSync’s efforts are directed to democratize access to investments and provide regular users with passive income. “We’re talking about the regular people that have $200 per se per month that they can allocate to specific investments.”

Bitcoin Price Rises After Bank of Canada Cuts Interest Rate Below 5% - Decrypt

We do the research, you get the alpha!Get exclusive reports and access to key insights on airdrops, NFTs, and more! Subscribe now to Alpha Reports and up your game!Go to Alpha ReportsCanada’s central bank just cut its benchmark interest rate for the first time in four years—a pivotal move that suggests other monetary authorities could soon start doing the same.That’s good news for risk assets like Bitcoin, which have historically performed well when borrowing money is cheap and when the fiat money supply is on the rise. After the news broke, Bitcoin shot up 1.5% to $71,600, its highest price since March. The price of BTC has settled to $70,930 as of writing, according to CoinGecko data.“We've come a long way in the fight against inflation,” said Bank governor Tiff Macklem during opening remarks on Wednesday. “And our confidence that inflation will continue to move closer to the two per cent target has increased over recent months.”The cut, which brings the country’s policy rate down 2 basis points from 5.0% to 4.75%, makes Canada the first G7 country to begin relaxing its fight against inflation, which overran the world during the COVID-19 pandemic.In Canada, annual Consumer Price Index (CPI) inflation has now cooled from 8.1% in June 2022 down to 2.7% in April 2024."We don't want monetary policy to be more restrictive than it needs to be to get inflation back to target,” said Macklem. “But if we lower our policy interest rate too quickly, we could jeopardize the progress we've made.”The central bank of Switzerland, where inflation was a low 1.4% in April, led the world with an interest rate cut back in March down to 1.5%. Meanwhile, the European Central Bank (ECB) is largely expected to cut its main refinancing rate by 25 basis points to 4.25% at its next meeting – which is tomorrow.By contrast, inflation in the United States has proven more sticky at 3.4% in April, prompting suspicions that the Federal Reserve could keep rates “higher for longer.”According to CME Fedwatch, the market still believes the Fed will keep rates flat at its June meeting, though a 25 basis point cut by September is viewed as the most likely outcome.That said, the Fed also cut the rate of its quantitative tightening program by over 50% last month, which has a net effect of reducing the pace at which the Fed takes money out of the economy.“Keeping front-end rates elevated while simultaneously tapering QT can be likened to both applying the brakes to a car and accelerating at the same time,” wrote Coinshares Head of Research James Butterill in May.Edited by Ryan Ozawa.Daily Debrief NewsletterStart every day with the top news stories right now, plus original features, a podcast, videos and more.

The Cutting Edge for Rates | Bankless


Cuts Are Coming! After two rough years combating inflation through higher interest rates, global central banks are finally beginning the rate cut process! How will this developing trend impact your investment portfolio in the coming months?Early this morning, the Bank of Canada (BOC) reduced its overnight interest rate target by 0.25% to 4.75%, the bank’s first cut in four years and the first instance of a G7 nation adopting looser monetary policy in the post-COVID era.While the Canadian consumer price index (CPI) for the month of April came in marginally above the bank’s long-term target of 2%, the BOC cited “continued evidence that underlying inflation is easing” in justifying its initial round of cuts.
Despite widespread uncertainty about when America’s Federal Reserve will cut interest rates, with one audacious Barron’s headline released this weekend even claiming there will be no cuts in 2024, interest rate reductions from the BOC were the base case scenario for this meeting: swap markets had priced in an 80% chance of their occurrence.Tomorrow, the European Central Bank (ECB) is set to announce its interest rate target for the month ahead, and market participants are near unanimous they will be cut, pricing in with 96% certainty that the ECB’s rate target will be reduced by 25 basis points.Falling risk-free rates globally amid resistance to cuts from the Fed increase the attractiveness of holding dollar investments, bolstering dollar strength that could potentially reignite inflationary pressures overseas and placing immense pressure on U.S. monetary officials to implement their own cuts in the near future.
 Western Bloc nations, particularly those belonging to the G7, exhibit extremely close policy alignment, meaning it is unlikely that the BOC and ECB would have made such major changes in policy without first consulting the Fed on when it intends to cut.Although the CME’s FedWatch Tool indicates that there is little change for change in US interest rates until September, it is clear that global policy makers are coordinating on lower interest rates, illuminating the pathway towards an aggressive cutting cycle.Bulls have been invigorated by the development, sending the prices of both stock indexes and crypto’s majors surging within inches of establishing new cycle highs, and while U.S. interest rate cuts remain largely unexpected from a seemingly hawkish Fed, this stance will is set to be reversed at the first sign of objectively troubling economic data.Many data series already show the economic decline has begun, and when taken in combination with emerging global trends of easing monetary policy – particularly among key economic allies – surprise Fed cuts could be in store for next week.
During the Global Financial Crisis, Fed officials attempted to kickstart the deteriorating economy and stall out the stock market slide with a dramatic 0.75% rate cut on January 22, 2008.While these cuts succeeded in producing temporary bullish tailwinds for risk assets, allowing the broad-market S&P 500 to rebound nearly 15% off its lows, unfortunately, they ultimately proved unsuccessful at yielding a lasting impact and the index’s price had halved by year end.The need for policy makers to cut rates is a harbinger for impending economic trouble, and historically, the tools available to central banks have proved ineffective at stymying the economic downside they are intended to prevent.

Ether Price Poised For Ballistic Rally As Spot ETH ETFs Could Pull In Record $4 Billion In First Five Months ⋆ ZyCrypto

&nbsp

&nbsp
Ethereum spot exchange-traded funds (ETFs) that directly hold ether will perform similarly well to their Bitcoin-based predecessors, drawing in $4 billion of inflows within the first five months after introduction, according to cryptocurrency analytics firm K33 Research.



1 Million ETH In Five Months



Ethereum, the world’s second-largest blockchain network, is now the focus of the next spot crypto ETF following the SEC’s recent approval of key regulatory filings from applicants. Analysts at K33 Research predict the stunning success of the incoming Ether-based products.



K33 Research’s $4 billion estimate is based on comparisons between existing Bitcoin (BTC) products and assets under management in similar ETH-based exchange-traded products (ETPs).



“This estimate is based on the relative global ETH assets under management (AUM) market share compared to BTC of 28%,” wrote K33 Senior analyst Vetle Lunde and DeFi analyst David Zimmerman in a Tuesday report.



Similarly, the ETH’s open interest on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME) is currently 23% of the size of BTC futures, indicating a similar market share in another institutionally concentrated market.

&nbsp



US spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds have so far attracted $13.9 billion since their January launch. Globally, these Bitcoin products now control more than 1 million BTC, comprising over 5% of the crypto’s circulating supply.



Contrarily, institutional funds presently hold 3.3% of the ETH’s total supply. Based on this, K33 expects anywhere from $3.1 billion to $4.8 billion worth of ETH ETF net flows within the first five months after the offerings officially go live. This would equate to 800,000 to 1.26 million ETH or approximately 0.7% to 1.05% of Ethereum’s circulating supply.



It’s a big prediction, considering the Ether futures ETF launch last year saw much lower demand than the debut of the first Bitcoin futures ETFs in 2021. K33 believes this muted launch was an outlier, given the bad timing with which ETH ETFs became available for investors, and does not represent ETH’s actual investment demand.



Big Ether Price Breakout Expected



Looking ahead, K33 anticipates an explosive Ethereum rally post-ETF approval.



“Such significant supply absorption shock will likely lead to price appreciation in ETH, per the strong relationship witnessed between BTC ETF flows and returns throughout the year,” said Vetle Lunde, senior analyst at K33 Research.



After an initial retracement in late January, Bitcoin surged roughly 60% to historic highs, thanks to listing spot ETFs on U.S. exchanges. K33 analysts noted that they are not “betting against [Larry] Fink,” with the BlackRock chief’s “Midas touch” creating a bullish setup for incredible strength for the crypto throughout the summer.



They predicted that with the introduction of Ethereum ETFs, the ETH price would start beating BTC after 2.5 years of the ETH-BTC pair’s downward trend.

10 Principles to Fast-Track Profitable Investing - Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) - Benzinga

In today's piece, I am going to break down ten market lessons that I wish I learned earlier. Market participants who thoroughly understand these principles will be on the fast track to profitability. Let's jump straight into it:1. Markets Discount the FutureWall Street and financial markets are master manipulators because they often bottom on poor news and vice versa. For example, Bitcoin BTC/USD bottomed within days of the FTX crypto exchange collapse, and hasn't looked back since.For equity markets, the psychology is the same. The S&P 500 Index ETF SPY and the other major indices bottomed the day inflation hit 40-year highs in the U.S in late 2022.2. Fundamentals Mean Little in a VacuumTo successfully analyze fundamentals, investors must account for the context of said fundamentals. The struggling e-commerce firm Carvana CVNA has soared more than 500% over the past year and provides a perfect fundamental lesson for investors. Why has the stock run so much? In late 2022, Carvana was on the brink of collapse. However, the company secured funding to keep the company in business. Later, it turned its earnings from awful to less bad.3. Valuations are Not a Timing DeviceAn important lesson is that valuation metrics like the price-to-sales (P/S) ratio are not a valid timing tool – especially for innovative growth stocks. While the numerator (price) is known, the denominator (sales) is not known (moving forward). Because of this misconception, Zacks Investment Research heavily weights its analysis and ratings based on forward EPS expectations. Amateur investors would probably be surprised to find that Nvidia's NVDA P/S ratio has actually fallen since mid-2023 despite the massive bull move in the stock.4. Strive to Trade Like a Casino (Edge)Like life, nothing on Wall Street or investing is ever obvious or certain, which is why most active retail investors lose money or underperform. Fortunately, perfection or a very high trade success rate is not necessary to achieve investment success. Think of a casino. Casinos don't make money on every hand. However, casinos enjoy an edge that, when played out over a large series of hands, pays the bills (and then some). Similarly, investors pay "tuition" to the stock market through stop losses and risk management.Amateur investors suffer from inconsistent returns because they tend to rely on gut feel and make emotional trades. Conversely, savvy investors leverage historical precedent, data sets, fundamentals and charts to gain an edge.5. Take Asymmetric BetsAmateur investors apply more emphasis to stock picking when they should focus more time and energy on sound money management principles. Fortunately, the math is simple to understand. If an investor risks $1 to make $5 on each trade, they can be wrong 80% of the time and still break even. Using these same numbers, an investor who achieves a 40% hit rate with this reward-to-risk ratio will be highly profitable over a large enough series of trades. Don't overthink investing; let the math work in your favor.6. Fundamentals are One Piece of the PuzzleThough fundamentals are integral to a stock's long-run performance, other factors, such as changes in share supply, play a role in direction. For example, "animal spirits" and hype have largely driven GameStop's GME super performance over the past few years. Meanwhile, though Apple's AAPL earnings have largely stagnated recently, record share buybacks have decreased supply and increased demand, driving the stock higher.7. U.S. Markets Rise in TimeDespite war, recession, and countless "Black Swan" events, U.S. equities tend to rise in the long run due to America's innovative nature. The S&P 500 Index has averaged returns ~100% over the past century. While the market suffers corrections in the short term, understanding the long-term picture pays long-term dividends.8. Innovation Breeds True Market LeadersThe best-performing growth stocks are driven by growing earnings, which are sparked by innovation and disruption. For example, Blockbuster was once far larger than Netflix NFLX. However, Blockbuster failed to recognize that technology was changing and the brick-and-mortar approach to movies would no longer be relevant. Conversely, NFLX pounced on the emerging DVD-by-mail trend, and later, the streaming trend, leading to a life-changing move for its investors.9. Forward EPS Estimates & The Zacks RankInvestors can screen a large database of stocks by sorting by the Zacks Rank. Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stocks signify that Wall Street analysts are becoming increasingly bullish on a company's fundamentals ahead. Our extensive in-house studies show that Zacks Rank #1 stocks tend to outperform dramatically, all else equal.10. Market Direction is KingApproximately 75% of a stock's move can be attributed to the general market's direction. The most straightforward way to size up the long-term trend is to plot the 200-day moving average over the major indices like the Nasdaq 100 ETF QQQ.When price is above the 200-day moving average, the market is in a bull phase, and vice versa. Never fight the trend.Bottom LineInstead of "trial by fire" investors can circumvent years of frustration by understanding ten essential principles.To read this article on Zacks.com click here.

Gary Gensler Is Now Being Asked About Bonk ETFs Following Ethereum Approvals - Decrypt

United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) Chair Gary Gensler found himself criticizing the crypto industry on live television yet again on Wednesday—but this time, the regulator appeared to use markedly softer language as he was asked about potential crypto ETFs ahead.“These tokens… have not given you the proper disclosures you not only need to make your investment decisions, but also that are required by the law,” Gensler said on CNBC when questioned by Jim Cramer about a slew of successful cryptocurrencies listed by the television personality. While Gensler’s tone was undeniably critical, his implication that tokens like Solana meme coin BONK might be considered acceptable investments given adequate disclosures is a far less harsh tune than the SEC chief has sung in the past. Just months ago, Gensler routinely dismissed the crypto market as a scam-riddled sector rife with “hucksters” and “fraudsters” that investors should best avoid.His apparent change in rhetoric comes just weeks after the SEC, in an eleventh-hour about-face, abruptly approved the trading of spot Ethereum ETFs on Wall Street. For months, such an outcome appeared increasingly unlikely, given recent allegations that the SEC has internally considered Ethereum to be an illegally unregistered security for over a year.While questions abound as to why Gensler and the SEC changed tack on Ethereum so suddenly, many believe the move was a direct result of shifting political winds in Washington. With the 2024 election fast approaching, and the crypto lobby dumping some $160 million into tight congressional races, many legislators have come to embrace the industry rather than fight it. Some financial analysts predict that by approving spot Ethereum ETFs, the SEC has opened the floodgates to other altcoin spot ETFs, including Solana and XRP.On Wednesday, Jim Cramer asked Gensler about the likelihood of an imminent BONK ETF trading on Wall Street—a question the SEC hair delicately sidestepped. In addition to crypto tokens, Gensler also criticized crypto exchanges from the floor of the New York Stock Exchange. “These crypto exchanges are doing things we would never allow this New York Stock Exchange to do,” Gensler said. “Our laws don’t allow you to trade against your customers.”The regulator has long accused major crypto exchanges of front-running, or using publicly available knowledge of pending on-chain transactions to beat out other users bidding for block space.

Dogecoin, Shiba Inu, PEPE Top Institutional Investors Meme Coin Holdings, How Much Did They Buy? | Bitcoinist.com


								Crypto exchange Bybit recently released a report highlighting how much institutional investors have invested in meme coins such as Dogecoin and Shiba Inu. The platform revealed that these investors have been actively trading these meme coins since the start of the year and noted what specific meme coins they are currently holding. 
How Institutional Investors Have Been Going All In On Meme Coins
According to the report, institutional investors began accumulating meme coins like Dogecoin (DOGE), Shiba Inu (SHIB), and Pepe (PEPE) between February and March, around when the meme coin trend began to pick up. Their spot holdings in these meme coins are said to have increased by 226% to $204 million. 

These institutional investors didn’t stop there. In April, they accumulated more of these meme coins, with their total meme coin holdings rising to $293.7 million. However, these investors looked to have exited their positions as the sentiment around meme coins peaked, with their meme coin holdings dropping to $139 million by May. 
These investors are believed to have taken some profits in anticipation of the prices of these meme coins dropping due to a wave of profit-taking. Meanwhile, these investors investing heavily in these meme coins in the first place again highlight the broad adoption that this category of crypto tokens has begun to enjoy since the beginning of the year.
The interest in these meme coins among institutional investors was also evident when asset manager VanEck launched a meme coin index to track the performance of the foremost meme coins. This index includes Dogecoin (DOGE), Shiba Inu (SHIB), Pepe (PEPE), Dogwifhat (WIF), Floki (FLOKI), and Bonk (BONK). 
Bybit revealed that retail investors have also been heavily invested in these meme coins, with their holdings rising by 478% from February to April. Like institutional investors, these retail investors also sold off a significant portion of their holdings, reducing their meme coin allocation from $567 million to $371 million. 
Dogecoin Tops Meme Coin Holdings Of Institutional And Retail Investors
Bybit mentioned that Dogecoin is the largest among the meme coin holdings of these institutional and retail investors. Institutional investors are said to have allocated more to the largest meme coin by market cap than retail investors, with Dogecoin accounting for 36.17% of their holdings. In comparison, DOGE only accounts for 24.58% of the meme coin holdings of retail investors.

Both categories of investors are believed to have favored Dogecoin more due to its “higher liquidity and relative stability.” Meanwhile, Ethereum-based meme coins Shiba Inu and Pepe also account for a significant portion of institutional and retail investors’ meme coin holdings. 
Shiba Inu and PEPE account for 20.95% and 14.61% of retail’s meme coin portfolio. On the other hand, institutions have invested 22.23% and 10.39% of their meme coin holdings in Shiba Inu and PEPE, respectively. Solana-based meme coin BONK was the most favored among the newer meme coins, with retail allocating $136 million to the meme coin while institutions allocated $74.5 million.

New Coinbase Smart Contract Wallet eliminates gas fees and recovery phrases - CoinJournal



                    

                    
Coinbase has launched a Smart Contract Wallet with simpler onboarding and no gas fees.
The smart contract wallet supports Ethereum, BNB, Polygon, and others for seamless transactions.
Developers using the smart contract wallet can waive gas fees.

In a move to enhance user experience and streamline cryptocurrency transactions, Coinbase, one of the leading cryptocurrency exchanges, has unveiled its latest innovation: the Coinbase Smart Contract Wallet.
The groundbreaking smart wallet promises to revolutionize the way users interact with cryptocurrencies by eliminating gas fees and simplifying the onboarding process.
Key features of the Coinbase Smart Contract Wallet
Unlike traditional wallets that require users to manage complex recovery phrases and incur gas fees for transactions, the Coinbase Smart Contract Wallet offers a seamless and cost-effective solution.
One of the key features of the smart contract wallet is its simplified onboarding process. Users can create a new wallet and onboard onto a blockchain without the need to download additional apps or manage recovery phrases. Instead, the smart wallet integrates seamlessly with major applications and offers multiple authentication methods, including Face ID, fingerprint ID, and Yubikey.
Moreover, the smart wallet ensures self-custody, allowing users to have full control over their funds. Users can make payments directly from their Coinbase Wallet or Coinbase account, further enhancing convenience and accessibility.
Another notable aspect of the Coinbase Smart Contract Wallet is its integration with major blockchain networks.
At launch, the wallet will support a variety of networks, including Base, Ethereum, Optimism, Arbitrum, Polygon, Avalanche, BNB Chain, and Zora. This multi-chain support enables users to access a wide range of cryptocurrencies and decentralized applications (DApps) within a single platform.
Furthermore, Coinbase has introduced a unique feature that allows developers to waive gas fees by sponsoring transactions through a paymaster. This incentivizes developers to support the adoption of the smart wallet and contribute to a more seamless user experience.
The companion web app serves as the primary platform for users, offering comprehensive asset and identity management, as well as features such as buying, sending, swapping, NFTs, and transaction history.
Coinbase aims to provide users with a fluid and intuitive experience throughout their interactions with the smart wallet.
Loopring and Argent pioneered the smart contract wallets
Coinbase is not the first to launch a smart contract wallet. It is only building upon the growing trend of smart wallet technology in the cryptocurrency space.
The smart contract wallet technology was pioneered by companies like Loopring and Argent. The wallets offer enhanced security, usability, and cost-effectiveness compared to traditional wallet solutions.

Bitcoin (BTC) Options Traders Anticipate Brakeout Above $74K to New Record Prices Soon

Bitcoin has spent almost three months consolidating since notching an all-time high slightly below $74,000 in mid-March. After plummeting briefly below $57,000 in early May, it saw a steady recovery, now changing hands at around $71,000, only a few percentage points from new record prices.

The Protocol: Another Episode in the Layer-2 Teams Drama

This isn’t the first time that Matter Labs has found itself in hot water with its competitors. In August 2023, the Polygon team went on a media blitz with the claim that Matter Labs had copied its Plonky-2 software system without proper attribution. Leaders from other teams, like Starkware, also weighed in at the time, expressing their disappointment with Matter Labs. (Gluchowski denied the claims of copying but said his team “could have done better” by providing clearer attribution to other teams' open-source code.) Polygon co-founder Sandeep Nailwal seemed to reference the debacle when he weighed in on the earlier dispute, saying in a statement last week that "zkSync has repeatedly acted contrary to the Web3 ethos, despite consistently signaling those same values. We believe that if we do not publicly address this behavior, it will persist and potentially worsen." Alex Gluchowski, the CEO of Matter Labs, initially dismissed the complaints, sharing that his intention with the trademark application was to protect users and adding that Matter Labs would eventually move to share the trademark with a yet-to-exist consortium of ecosystem stakeholders. Three days later, however, Matter Labs opted to walk back on its trademark efforts entirely.

Good News from Franklin Templeton CEO on Bitcoin: "We Have Not Seen The Second Wave Yet" - Bitcoin Sistemi


Franklin Templeton CEO Jenny Johnson expressed optimism about the future of US spot Bitcoin ETFs in a recent interview. Johnson believes his company's fund is well positioned to capture greater market share and expects an increase in demand for these products.
“We haven't even had the second wave yet. This is really the first wave of early adopters, and I think the next wave will be larger institutions that are more comfortable with how the system fits in,” Johnson said.


Spot Bitcoin ETFs have seen significant capital inflow since their launch on January 11, generating over $13 billion in net inflows in less than three months. To date, they have seen a total inflow of 14.8 billion dollars. This influx of capital has driven the BTC price up over 60% year-to-date, reaching a new peak price of $73,700 in March.

However, both ETF inflows and price movements stagnated in April and May, leading to speculation that demand may have peaked. Despite this, Johnson believes many professional money managers are still figuring out how to incorporate Bitcoin into their portfolio strategies.





“Right now Bitcoin is a little bit risk-on, a little bit risk-off,” he said, adding: “It's a little bit like gold, so some people think about it that way, some think about it in terms of technology.”
Johnson stated that the firm hopes its Bitcoin product will attract fee-sensitive investors and thus capture a larger market share.

US employment data reinforces rate cuts, boosting crypto: Nansen analyst - Crypto Briefing


            
            
                            
            
                            
            
            The US ADP National Employment Report increased by 152,000 in May, below the expected number of 175,000 and the smallest increase since January. The ADP measures the monthly change in non-farm and private employment and a result below the expected signals that employment growth and wage growth are slowing down.Aurelie Barthere, Principal Research Analyst at research firm Nansen, assesses that this result paints a picture of moderating real growth and a cooling labor market in the US when combined with other real activity data, such as retail sales, Q1 GDP, and CAPEX.“As long as growth slows but does not contract, it is likely to push US rates lower and become a tailwind for crypto. So far, we cannot say that the slowdown in growth is too severe,” added Barthere.Moreover, she mentions the services sector, which is holding up as proven by the latest PMI business survey, and highlighted that Jerome Powell has indicated that, were unemployment to increase with inflation sticky, he would have a preference for rate cuts.“So investors are pricing a ‘Fed put’ when growth data comes in weak, but not too weak. Friday’s payroll is likely to become the next major data point in this narrative.”A bright JuneCrypto industry players expect a “bright June” for the market, as reported by Crypto Briefing. Fueled by the spot Ethereum (ETH) exchange-traded funds (ETF) approval in the US, this month can be met with an ETH price leap.Additionally, ETH price momentum could spark a broad altcoin market growth, resulting in a “meme coin summer”, as this sector of the crypto market is showing the same signs of the non-fungible token (NFT) summer witnessed in 2021. As a result, retail money pulled from other high-yield projects temporarily might flow into crypto.There are also the European Parliament elections, set to happen between June 6th and June 9th, in which the results could mean a more pro-crypto stance in the European Union, resulting in favorable regulations.

Chainlink Tops Real-World Crypto Assets With the Most Development Again


																Chainlink (LINK), the native token of the decentralized blockchain oracle network built on Ethereum, has emerged once more as the top real-world asset with the most development activity in the last 30 days.
According to a tweet by Santiment, LINK is followed by Synthetix (SNX), Centrifuge (CFG), and Oraichain (ORAI).
Top RWAs With the Most Development
Real-world assets are cryptocurrencies that represent physical assets like properties and objects. Like other crypto assets, they run on smart contracts and blockchains and have been gaining popularity recently, with a market capitalization running into billions of dollars.
Santiment determines which real-world assets are seeing significant developer activity by pulling their projects’ GitHub data from repositories through a back-tested process to ensure only the teams’ efforts to innovate and improve are included. The on-chain analytics firm compiles the list of the top ten most developed projects by counting their non-redundant GitHub activity and averaging their daily data over the last 30 days.
Through the methodology, Santiment found that LINK was the most developed real-world asset in the crypto sector. The cryptocurrency also topped the list for April, producing 2.49x more daily activity than Synthetix, which came second place at the time. In May, Chainlink recorded a developer activity of 428.83, roughly 45 points up from its April activity of 383.03.




LINK to See Higher Rally
It is worth noting that SNX and CFG maintained their second and third places on the list after LINK, with GitHub activities that spiked significantly, indicating rising interest in the projects. Oraichain surpassed Dusk Foundation and took fourth place, while the latter fell to fifth.
Santiment noted that MakerDAO and Polymesh also emerged as notable risers, climbing up two positions. On the other hand, IX Swap fell to the eighth position as MakerDAO surpassed it. Projects like Defactor appeared on the list while Creditcoin left.
Chainlink’s sustained development activity coincides with LINK’s 25% rally in the past month and analysts’ belief that the digital asset could keep rising in the coming months. The predictions are substantiated by the rise in LINK whale activity, daily transaction volume, and major partnerships with heavyweight traditional finance firms.

Jim Cramer Asks SEC Chair If There Will Be A BONK ETF


																Gary Gensler – chairman of the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) – sat down with CNBC’s Mad Money host Jim Cramer on Wednesday to discuss the regulator’s Bitcoin and Ethereum ETF approvals, alongside what may be coming next.
That included questions about whether obscure meme coins could soon receive their own ETFs, such as SushiSwap (SUSHI) and Bonk (BONK).

Cramer named a host of coins to Gensler that had all traded “millions of dollars” on Wednesday morning – including Cardano, Cosmos, Immutable, Ronin, and MyNeighborAlice, among others.

“Now in two weeks, should we have a SushiSwap ETF?” asked Cramer. “I would think that Bonk is a natural, and Osmosis. These are millions of dollars these things are trading – shouldn’t we have some sort of product?”

Gensler did not provide specific answers to those questions, but noted that many of the crypto tokens generally “have not given you the disclosures you need to make investment decisions,” implying that such tokens are unregistered securities.
He also called out crypto exchange platforms, which are “doing things we would never allow our New York Stock Exchange to do.”
“You’ve seen the bankruptcies in this space,” Gensler said. “The most leading lights in this field are either in jail, about to go to jail, or awaiting extradition.”
Gensler also commented on the Ethereum spot ETF approvals late last month, which he said will still “take some time” before their registration statements are approved and they can be listed on public exchanges.
When previously questioned on the matter, BlackRock’s Head of Digital Assets said the fund had little interest in launching altcoin ETFs, with Bitcoin being the “overwhelming top priority” among its client base.

Coinbase Reveals New Smart Wallet Platform Offering ‘Gasless On-Chain Experience’ - The Daily Hodl


								Coinbase, the largest crypto exchange in the US, has announced the launch of its new smart wallet platform.
In a blog post, Coinbase says the launch will kick off the next chapter in the firm’s Coinbase Wallet product by “revolutionizing the on-chain experience” by getting rid of network fees and recovery phrases.










Says Coinbase,
“Smart wallets offer a streamlined, gasless on-chain experience. This simplicity, combined with multi-chain support and integration with major applications, will make onboarding to the blockchain as effortless as signing into your favorite website. 
Until now, going on-chain has been slow, expensive, and hard, with separate wallet app installs and first-generation blockchains. Smart wallets, with their ease of use, paired with next-generation Layer 2 networks like Base, finally set the stage to bring many more people onchain. Now, getting onchain is easy, fast, and cheap.”
Coinbase will be offering a companion web application for the new smart wallet with features like asset and identity management, buy, send, swap, NFTs, and transaction history. The web app will be the primary platform for smart wallet users to manage their wallets.
Once it launches, Coinbase says that smart wallets will initially support eight networks, including Base, Ethereum, Optimism, Arbitrum, Polygon, Avalanche, BNB and Zora, though other chains will be integrated in the future.
The firm is also encouraging developers to integrate smart wallets into their apps by allowing them to earn up to $15,000 in gas credits through the “Base Gasless Campaign” which will essentially allow the sponsorship of their users’ transactions at zero cost.
Says Coinbase,
“Our smart wallets represent a significant leap forward in the world of self-custody and onchain transactions. By addressing the main concerns of traditional self-custody wallets and providing a seamless, secure, and user-friendly experience, smart wallets are poised to transform the way we interact on-chain. 
We’re excited for developers and users to take advantage of this new groundbreaking solution, and we believe that simplifying the onboarding experience will lead to widespread adoption.”

Binance Exec Saga: 16 US Lawmakers Urge For Biden’s Action


								The complex saga between crypto exchange Binance and the Nigerian government has intensified as US congress members have called for the Biden administration’s immediate action.
In a letter addressed to the US president, the lawmakers expressed concern about Binance Executive Tigran Gambaryan’s health and urged the government to bring him back from Nigerian imprisonment.

US Lawmakers Urge For Binance Exec Safely Return
On June 4, 16 US congress members signed a letter urging President Biden to intervene in the case of former US federal agent Tigran Gambaryan. The executive has been detained in Nigeria for the past three months, and his current health state has raised alarms among House members.
Nigerian authorities detained Gambaryan on February 26 alongside his colleague Nadeem Anjarwalla, who later escaped. Since then, the executive has been in custody, without access to his passport, and under supervised communication with his legal team and family.

The letter states that Gambaryan’s unlawful detention has been marked by excessive and harsh treatment. It emphasizes that the charges against the executive are “baseless and constitute a coercion tactic by the Nigerian government to extort his employer, Binance.”
In court, the Nigerian authorities have admitted to retaining Gambaryan as their only bargaining card against the crypto exchange. On April 25, the prosecutor stated that since “The 1st defendant [Binance] is operating virtually. The only thing we have to hold on to is this defendant [Tigran].”
Binance’s CEO, Richard Teng, has addressed this in a letter. Teng called out the Nigerian government for trying to set a dangerous precedent for all companies worldwide with its crackdown on Binance’s mid-level employees.
A Call For Action “Before It’s Too Late”
The US lawmakers highlighted Gambaryan’s “impressive and distinguished” background as a federal agent. Additionally, they pointed out the irony of his legacy being acclaimed by the government while the former federal agent fights for his life in a prison cell:

Mr. Gambaryan’s legacy of dedication to justice and the law continued even after he left federal service. On May 3rd of this year, while Tigran fought for his life inside a prison cell designed to hold ISIS combatants, the U.S. Department of Justice issued a press release announcing a historic seizure, thanking former Special Agent Tigran for his groundbreaking work in the investigation.

In the letter, the congress members painted a worrying picture, explaining that the executive’s life was at risk due to a lack of medical treatment. As reported by Bitcoinist, Gambaryan suffered from a health episode during a court hearing on May 23.
The day prior, the former US federal agent failed to appear in court for the tax evasion case against him, raising concerns about his physical state and whereabouts. However, he showed up to the money laundering charges hearing the next day, where he collapsed and required medical assistance.
Since then, it has been revealed that Gambaryan tested positive for malaria and has been denied adequate medical assistance by the prison officers. Due to his collapse, the court ordered that the executive be sent to a hospital to be treated.
According to the lawmakers’ letter, this request has not been fully complied with, and Gambaryan has not received adequate treatment for the disease. As a result, the House members, including Chairman Michael McCaul, are urging the US government to step forward.
The letter requests Gambaryan’s case to be transferred to the Office of the Special President Envoy for Hostages Affairs. Ultimately, the politicians expressed their fear for the executive’s life and called for immediate action “before it’s too late.”

Giant Ethereum Whale Adds 7,000 ETH to its $140 Million Stash as Spot Ether ETFs Loom | Cryptoglobe


                                
A “giant” Ethereum (ETH) whale that has mad over $76 million in profit from investing in the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization has restarted accumulating more tokens amid growing speculation that spot Ether exchange-traded funds (ETFs) will soon start trading in the United States.



According to blockchain analytics firm SpotOnChain, this “giant whale” has recently withdrawn 7,000 ETH worth over $26 million from leading cryptocurrency exchange Binance at around $3,800 per coin, after withdrawing most of their ETH during last year’s bear market, and depositing it back onto the centralized exchange once the price rose.



The whale currently holds 36,785 ETH worth over $140 million and is sitting on a profit of around $76.6 million.







As CryptoGlobe reported, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission unexpectedly permitted spot Ether exchange-traded funds for Ether last month in a surprising move that saw the price of ETH soar over 25% as the market was expecting a rejection.



Investors are likely to be encouraged by the successful debut of US-listed spot Bitcoin ETFs in January, which have accumulated billions in assets at a rapid pace, to the point BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) became the fastest ETF to hit $20 billion in assets in just 144 days, with the runner-up having done so in over 900 days.







            
            

            
            

            
            

        

Adding to this whale accumulation has been growing, as according to an analyst from cryptocurrency analytics firm CryptoQuant, over 800,000 ETH worth around $3 billion has moved off of centralized cryptocurrency exchanges in little over a week.



The analyst noted that institutions preparing for a spot Ethereum ETF to start trading in the United States could be behind the centralized exchange outflows in a bid to meet the potential demand from investors for such a fund.



Notably IntoTheBlock, a cryptocurrency intelligence firm, has noted that whale accumulation has recently intensified, with 41% of the supply of the second-largest cryptocurrency now being held by addresses with more than 1% of its total circulating supply, up from 36% at the beginning of the year.



Per the firm, the trend highlights the increasing confidence in ETH among large holders.

Three Whales Activated: They're Making Crazy Transactions on This Memecoin - Bitcoin Sistemi


According to onchain data provided by Lookonchain, a whale has started to accumulate truly incredible amounts of memecoins.
A total of 9 cryptocurrency wallets owned by two different whales purchased 1.35 trillion Shiba Inu (SHIB) worth 35.2 million dollars at an average price of 0.00002596 dollars in the last 12 hours.


At the time of writing this article, SHIB price is trading at $0.00002581. It appears that the whale's purchase did not result in a meaningful increase in the price of the memecoin.

Further onchain analysis showed that yet another SHIB whale was buying. According to the data, in the last 6 hours, a whale purchased 715.9 billion SHIB tokens by paying 4,849 ETH worth 18.44 million dollars. Previously, this whale had purchased 5.5 trillion units of SHIB for only $400 thousand in the early period of SHIB and sold it for $121 million at the two peaks.





So this whale had previously earned approximately 120 million dollars in total through SHIB.

Crypto Case Fiasco Leads To Complete Shutdown Of SEC Office In This City | Bitcoinist.com


								As a result of its ongoing crackdown on the nascent crypto industry and mounting unfavorable results in its cases against digital asset platforms, the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has announced the impending closure of its regional office in Salt Lake City, citing “significant attrition.” 
The Salt Lake City office is the SEC’s sole regional outpost, and its enforcement authority is limited to a single state. Utah’s jurisdiction will now be transferred to the SEC’s Denver office while the regulator affirms its commitment to keeping other regional offices open.
SEC’s Loss In Debt Box Crypto Case 
According to the Wall Street Journal, the decision to close the Salt Lake City office comes after a turbulent period, primarily associated with the SEC’s failed enforcement action against Digital Licensing, also known as Debt Box, a cryptocurrency platform. 
People familiar with the matter clarify that the office closure is related to, but not solely a consequence of, the SEC’s setback in the Debt Box case.

In August of the previous year, the Salt Lake City office secured a temporary asset freeze and restraining order against Debt Box, as it accused the company and its principals of defrauding investors of at least $49 million.  
However, in November, Judge Robert Shelby expressed concerns over material misrepresentations by SEC lawyers from the Salt Lake City office while obtaining the temporary restraining order. 
The following month, SEC enforcement director Gurbir Grewal apologized in a court filing, and in January, the agency filed a motion to dismiss the case.
SEC Ordered To Pay $1.8 Million In Fees
Despite initial admissions of mistakes and apologies for the “shortfall” in the case, the SEC’s attempt at damage control proved ineffective. In an 80-page ruling, Judge Shelby imposed sanctions on the SEC, requiring them to cover Debt Box’s legal fees related to the temporary restraining order. Furthermore, the judge denied the SEC’s motion to dismiss the lawsuit without prejudice. 
The SEC faced another setback when ordered to pay Debt Box approximately $1.8 million in fees, including receiver fees and legal expenses.
Debt Box expressed satisfaction with the dismissal, characterizing it as a significant victory. However, the SEC’s legal entanglements within cryptocurrency are far from over. 
The regulatory agency continues to face ongoing challenges with prominent cryptocurrency companies such as Binance, Kraken, Ripple, and Coinbase, in addition to its unresolved conflict with Debt Box.

The Salt Lake City office experienced personnel departures after the Debt Box case. Two SEC lawyers, Michael Welsh and Joseph Watkins, resigned in April, while the office’s director, Tracy Combs, also stepped down in May.
As the SEC grapples with the fallout from its failed enforcement action and the closure of its Salt Lake City office, its engagements with major cryptocurrency industry players remain in the spotlight.

Analyst Says Get Ready As Dogecoin Enters ‘Expansion Stage’, Can DOGE Reach $12?


																Dogecoin is one of the cryptocurrencies getting a lot of interest from analysts recently. With meme coins expected to outperform once again during this bull cycle, crypto analyst Crypto Kinfolk has pointed out where the Dogecoin price could end up as this bull cycle manifests.
Dogecoin Enters Expansion Stage
In an analysis posted on the TradingView platform, crypto analyst Crypto Kinfolk laid out a possible scenario that could see the Dogecoin price soar from here. Starting out with a brief history, the crypto analyst highlighted how far the meme coin has come since being created back in 2013 as a joke. Also, having such a long history has made it possible for historical analysis to be drawn for the meme coin.

	Related Reading


One of these historical analyses is how the price of Dogecoin has performed in previous bull markets. In the last two bull markets, meaning the 2017-2018 and 2020-2021 bull markets, the DOGE price saw massive gains of 21,000% and 50,000%, respectively.
Given this, a continuation of this trend could suggest that the meme coin could outperform in another bull market. As Crypto Kinfolk points out, Dogecoin has created a habit of mimicking its performance from the last bull cycle. So if there is a repeat, then this bull cycle could be just as explosive as the last, leading to what the analyst calls “a mind melting bull run.”
Can DOGE Price Rise To $12 This Bull Cycle?
Pointing to the chart, Crypto Kinfolk explains that Dogecoin has finally completed its bear market trend, which is now giving way for recovery. More importantly, the meme coin is breaking out of accumulation, something that is historically bullish for price. As a result of this, the crypto analyst believes that the DOGE price has now entered an “expansion stage.”
In this expansion stage, the meme coin is expected to outperform, and even if it replicates just a small percentage of its previous bull runs, its price could quickly rise to unprecedented levels. The first target put forward by the analyst in this stage is $4.20. Hitting this first target would mean an almost 2,500% increase from its current price level of $0.1626 at the time of writing.
Source: Tradingview.com
However, the analyst does not stop there, expecting further outperformance from the meme coin. The second target is a 6,100% increase to hit the $10.10 level. Last but not least, the third target was placed at $12, representing an expected 7,200% increase in price.

“With rumors shooting around the internet that Elon may add DOGE as the local currency for the X platform and this being a real possibility, I think it is counterproductive to think these type of gains are not in the cards,” Crypto Kinfolk concluded.

On Wednesday, the specialized tracker tweeted that 1.365 BTC (worth approximately $97,662) was lost by users attempting to mint Rune 777, also known as LEEROY JENKINS.Runes is a fungible token protocol on the Bitcoin network that lets users “etch” and mint tokens on the world’s largest blockchain.“The way Runes minting works is there is a mint window in which all Runes minting transactions are valid,” pseudonymous Ord co-founder Leonidas explained to Decrypt—for example, from block 840,000 to block 841,000. “Towards the end of every Runes mint, people rush to get their mint transactions mined before the window closes.”In the above example, Leonidas explained, if a mint transaction was mined in block 841,001, the collector would have paid the network fees to no avail.“If you fail to get your transactions in there, you lose your BTC and don't receive Runes,” Leonidas said. “This is just how the protocol works.” Toward the end of popular mints, he added, demand for minting outpaces the supply of space in a blockchain block.According to the Ord website, LEEROY JENKINS has a max supply of 69.4 million and currently has 1,350 holders. Of 57,850 completed mints, 276 were labeled as invalid—and those disappointed minters have no recourse.“Bitcoin is not aware of the Runes protocol and does not have the capability to use logic the way a smart contract would to refund invalid mints,” he said. “To the Bitcoin network, a Runes mint is just a meaningless piece of data.”The name LEEROY JENKINS comes from the iconic World of Warcraft character of the same name. The infamous player, created by Ben Schulz, cost his dungeon party their treasure by recklessly charging into a battle, ignoring the plan of attack. Jenkins has since become an internet meme.Leonidas said that while Runes minting sites could attempt to help users avoid losing out, there may always be losers.“The minting platforms can only make a recommendation and educate about how minting on the Runes Protocol works—ultimately it is still very zero-sum, though, and somebody will be losing,” he said. “If one minting platform is very good at educating their users about setting fee rates extra high at the end of mints, those minters are still taking spots from somebody else who will then have an invalid mint.”Edited by Ryan Ozawa.Daily Debrief NewsletterStart every day with the top news stories right now, plus original features, a podcast, videos and more.

Ethereum Price to Hit $22,000 by 2030, Predicts VanEck - Decrypt

We do the research, you get the alpha!Get exclusive reports and access to key insights on airdrops, NFTs, and more! Subscribe now to Alpha Reports and up your game!Go to Alpha ReportsGlobal asset manager VanEck predicted Wednesday that the price of Ethereum will reach $22,000 by the end of the decade, dubbing the cryptocurrency “digital oil” in a new report. That would represent a 468% increase from Ethereum’s current price.While Ethereum has generated $3.4 billion in revenue over the past year, VanEck additionally sees that figure reaching $51 billion by 2030.“We believe ETH is a revolutionary asset with few parallels in the non-crypto financial world,” the report asserted. “The Ethereum network is likely to continue its rapid market share growth from traditional financial market participants and, increasingly, Big Tech.”VanEck characterized Ethereum as the centerpiece of its own financial system, as its network already secures over $90 billion in stablecoins, around $7 billion in tokenized assets, and $308 billion in digital assets.At the same time, VanEck sees Ethereum making inroads outside of crypto. Based on the size of business sectors that Ethereum-built applications could disrupt, VanEck estimated that the network's total addressable market stands at $15 trillion. Those opportunities lie largely in finance, banking, and payments, VanEck said.Ethereum could also find roles in infrastructure and artificial intelligence, the firm added, as well as marketing, advertising, social, and gaming.The report highlighted some of Ethereum’s distinct aspects as a network and an asset, from its nature as “programmable money” to a “yield bearing commodity.” Notably, VanEck’s report calls Ethereum an “internet reserve currency,” central to its massive ecosystem and layer-2 networks.VanEck’s report comes not long after the Securities and Exchange Commission’s approval of spot Ethereum ETFs. Allowing mainstream investors to gain exposure to the cryptocurrency in a traditional brokerage account, the move also had implications for Ethereum’s regulatory status.For crypto natives, the concept may be basic, but its significance was underscored by VanEck: In order to send Ethereum or engage with smart contracts, a user needs to spend Ethereum on gas fees, which are then removed from circulation through burning. In essence, VanEck said that this dynamic benefits Ethereum holders two-fold: providing demand while reducing supply.The asset manager expects Ethereum will also chip away at established tech giants like Google and Apple as a platform for developers to create consumer-facing applications. While the firms take around 30% of revenue from apps hosted in their respective digital stores, VanEck said Ethereum currently takes around 24% of reventhrough gas fees.“Compared to data-centric social networking platforms like Facebook, we believe Ethereum may enable more capable and lucrative applications for entrepreneurs,” the report stated. “As more data is generated in public and more commerce is moved off expensive, closed financial rails, business moats will erode.”Edited by Ryan Ozawa.Daily Debrief NewsletterStart every day with the top news stories right now, plus original features, a podcast, videos and more.

Ethereum Devs Shut Down Linea-Can Layer-2 Networks Be Trusted? - Decrypt

Late Saturday, an Ethereum layer-2 network called Linea found itself stuck between a rock and a hard place.Using an exploit, attackers had drained $2.3 million worth of ETH from a decentralized exchange that operates on Linea, called Velocore. Unable to reach the Velocore team, Linea’s leadership made the decisive call to freeze all transactions across the network in an effort to prevent further malfeasance. The plan worked: Linea users were insulated from additional losses. That’s when the trouble started. Crypto users immediately decried Linea’s actions across social media, arguing that the company had violated the industry’s core principle, decentralization. If a few people could halt Linea in their pajamas, then how could the network be considered any better than Wells Fargo?Linea immediately pivoted, posting on Twitter that the network was still in the “training wheels” phase of decentralization, but that it planned to eventually transition to a completely trustless structure. (Disclosure: Linea is owned by Consensys, which is one of 22 investors in Decrypt).   The incident laid bare a contradiction, some developers say, that doesn’t only pertain to just one blockchain. Rather, it exposed flaws in the entire, burgeoning layer-2 ecosystem—a collection of privately owned networks that has been frequently touted as Ethereum’s path forward.  “So you're saying you intervened on behalf of users here, but in the future, hopefully, if you work really hard, you won’t be able to intervene and your users will lose all their money?” Tom Lehman, the co-founder of several Ethereum projects including layer-1 alternative Facet and Ethscriptions, told Decrypt. “It doesn’t make sense.”To Lehman, the contradictions exposed by Linea’s public relations woes this week are not isolated—they are endemic to layer-2 networks. “Having a layer-2 that's centrally controlled is not a problem,” he said. “It’s just that every single one of them being centrally controlled is a problem.”Nearly all major scaling networks—like Optimism, Arbitrum, Base, and Polygon—were created by private, for-profit companies. Most rely on sequencers, controlled by the network’s team, which batch transactions together and submit them to the Ethereum mainnet. In such cases, like Linea’s, project teams have the power to effectively shut off a network by halting said sequencers. Why do most layer-2s exert such centralized control over their transactions? Linea, which did not respond to Decrypt’s questions by the time of publication, claimed in statements this week that the issue is a technical one that requires long-term finesse. But financial incentives may also be at play. By controlling that single choke point through which all transactions must pass, layer-2 teams also control the profits derived from processing every network transaction. Such fees are the lifeblood of layer-2s, which often employ dozens of people, and such Ethereum networks are collectively raking in millions of dollars in monthly, on-chain profit.“L2s can be very profitable to run,” Lehman said. “But that profit is tied to how much control you have.”Some layer-2 teams say they are ahead of the pack, and have taken distinct steps towards decentralization. Arbitrum, for example, features a backup pathway that allows users to post their transactions to Ethereum directly, in case any issues emerge within the Arbitrum ecosystem. Submitting transactions via this delayed inbox is not ideal, however, and can take up to 24 hours. Steven Goldfeder, the CEO of Arbitrum core developer Offchain Labs, told Decrypt that the company is currently working to decentralize its sequencer—but made a point of arguing that it poses less of a centralization threat than other layer-2s, given that the Arbitrum Foundation could not single-handedly prevent users from posting transactions.  “On Arbitrum, the problem is a lot smaller than on other networks,” said Goldfeder.Goldfeder welcomes vocal criticism of centralization risks in the layer-2 ecosystem. He believes such dissent applies crucial pressure to companies that otherwise might focus on different priorities.“Otherwise, you have the wrong incentives: growth first, and decentralization at some point,” he said. “If we just take one centralized system and replace it with another centralized system with a vague claim of eventually decentralizing—often without technical details—then I think it's very dangerous.”Some developers like Arjun Bhuptani, the founder of inter-blockchain bridge Everclear, however, feel that even Arbitrum’s solution to current centralization issues on layer-2s is insufficient.“It is better, but is still not ‘censorship resistance,’” he told Decrypt of Arbitrum. Further, Arbitrum itself has suffered network-wide outages repeatedly in the last year. To Bhuptani, the issue of centralization is so pervasive on layer-2s simply because the privately owned networks are currently facing other, greater concerns.“It largely just comes down to prioritization,” he said. “Projects are seeing bigger threats to their survival today on other axes than censorship, and so building decentralization is lower priority than things like security, custody risk, and market traction.”It’s true that the matter of censorship on layer-2 networks is still largely theoretical. The Linea team, for example, has never used its power to block transactions on behalf of a sovereign government. But such a scenario is by no means fanciful. The U.S. government has blacklisted Ethereum wallet addresses on multiple occasions. Centralized crypto exchanges have cooperated with the Israeli government to ban flagged accounts. Just last month, a Dutch court sentenced a developer of Tornado Cash, an Ethereum coin mixer designed to keep transactions private, to over five years in prison. Even those within the layer-2 ecosystem worry about what might happen if the private teams behind so many networks—which, thanks to their incredibly low transaction fees, have recently been positioned as the best way to securely onboard the masses to crypto—are legally compelled to do the bidding of governments across the world. “Something that I might think is legitimate,” Goldfeder said, “some oppressive regime somewhere might think is illegitimate behavior that should be censored.”Some Ethereum developers feel, however, that the whole debate this week about Linea and crypto’s future has been blown out of proportion.  “It's easy for people who were not affected by hacks to complain,” Joseph Schiarizzi, developer of Arbitrum-based stablecoin OpenDollar, told Decrypt. “But if you've ever been a victim, you understand the Linea team made the right move.”“I do not expect every piece of infrastructure to be decentralized,” he continued. “I care much more about honesty and transparency, which Linea was great on.”Lehman, who is currently developing a more decentralized alternative to networks like Arbitrum and Optimism, said he doesn’t want to demonize layer-2 networks or dismiss their usefulness. He only worries about crypto’s future if they become omnipresent.“The problem comes when you say ‘L2s are the future, that's how we scale, that's it,’” Lehman said. “And in the process, [you] hand over the keys to giant billion-dollar entities and endorse them running insecure systems.”Edited by Andrew HaywardDaily Debrief NewsletterStart every day with the top news stories right now, plus original features, a podcast, videos and more.

Bitcoin (BTC) on Verge of Hitting $71,000, Ethereum (ETH) Shows Bizarre Activity, Will Solana (SOL) Become Number 1 Again?

Bitcoin has finally broken through $70,000, setting itself up for further growth. As we can see, there is a good chance it will succeed at it, as the price is moving closer to $71,000 and trading volumes remain elevated.This bullish momentum is easily visible on the daily chart of Bitcoin versus the U.S. dollar (BTC/USD). Bitcoin is currently trading around $70,977 with the price action showing a steady climb. A major turning point was reached recently when the market broke above $70,000, indicating fresh interest and optimism. This optimistic view is supported by several important technical indicators. Bitcoin/USD Chart by TradingViewThe 50-day and 200-day moving averages in particular are positioned in a way that indicates sustained upward momentum. A traditional bullish signal known as a golden cross formed when the 50-day moving average crossed above the 200-day moving average.Volume analysis supports this optimistic scenario even more. The recent price surge is accompanied by elevated trading volumes, indicating strong market participation and interest at these price points. Maintaining the present upward trend and possibly pushing Bitcoin above $71,000 require this volume support. Furthermore Bitcoin remains a favorable investment option given the current macroeconomic climate. Bitcoin's allure as a store of value and safeguard against the devaluation of fiat currencies is still great in light of persistent worries about economic stability.Ethereum's weird positionThe surge toward $3,800 was not expected by the market, yet we are here. However, Ethereum's activity raises a lot of questions as the asset's price is going through an extremely prolonged consolidation phase, and it is unclear whether or not it will come out as a winner from it.After the steep increase to $3,800, the price of Ethereum has been trapped in a narrow range, as can be seen by looking at the daily chart of ETH against the USD. When buyers and sellers are evenly matched, the market is usually in a state of indecision, as indicated by this sideways movement. Ethereum has tested $3,750 several times without breaking below what appears to be the key support level. A number of technical indicators shed light on Ethereum's present situation. A golden cross, or the potential continuation of a bullish trend, could be indicated if the 50-day moving average, which is approaching the 200-day moving average, crosses above it. However, the market continues to be cautious until such a crossover occurs. Further more, the fact that trading volumes have been comparatively low during this phase of consolidation suggests that a sizable portion of market participants are holding off until a more distinct trend becomes apparent. Solana's market positionSolana's path on the market was tough in the last few weeks, but things are changing rapidly, with Bitcoin bouncing toward $70,000 and investors gaining some of that positive sentiment back. However, fundamentally, Solana might not be doing as well as it used to.Solana shows a gradual but consistent recovery. The 50-day and 200-day moving averages are supporting the modest uptrend that Solana is currently showing at about $172. 92.  Though technical indicators point to a bright future, the larger ecosystem surrounding Solana paints a different picture. The Solana meme coin scene used to be a hive of activity and creativity, but it is not as active as recently.There has not been much buying interest in Solana, as seen by the low trading volume. This is concerning because price movements need to be supported and maintained by sustained volume, which is probably the biggest issue for it right now.

Nvidia Flips Apple As Stock Hits $3 Trillion Market Cap Amid AI Boom - Decrypt

The stock price of AI and gaming chip manufacturer Nvidia (NVDA) surged past $1,235 on Wednesday, up 14.2% for the day, bringing the company's market capitalization to $3.01 trillion, according to Yahoo! Finance. If the trend holds, Nvidia will be the second most valuable publicly traded company, leapfrogging iPhone maker Apple (AAPL).Nvidia—which has seen its stock skyrocket more than 150% so far this year—began the week trading at $1,125 on Monday before rising 9.78% on Wednesday. Apple is trading at $195.87, up 0.78% for the day.The only other company in the $3 trillion club is Microsoft (MSFT), which has long held the top spot at $3.15 trillion and is trading at $424.01.By comparison, the entire cryptocurrency marketplace has a market capitalization of $2.8 trillion, according to CoinGecko.The Decrypt Emerge 2023 company of the year, Nvidia has charged headlong into artificial intelligence, including hardware, software, and robotics.In February, the market cap of the global chipmaker flipped cloud computing and e-commerce giant Amazon (AMZN) when Nvidia hit $1.78 trillion, compared to Amazon’s $1.75 trillion at the time. Later that month, Nvidia reported $22.1 billion in revenue in the first quarter of 2024.“Accelerated computing and generative AI have hit the tipping point,” Nvidia founder and CEO Jensen Huang said at the time. “Demand is surging worldwide across companies, industries, and nations.”In March, Nvidia unveiled their new Blackwell AI GPU, as well as Project Gr00t—aimed at advancing humanoid robotics and AI—and a limited integration with Apple's Vision Pro.Reaction to the news of Nvidia’s new $3 trillion market cap was swift, with many—like Bloomberg senior ETF analyst Eric Balchunasa—putting the giant numbers into perspective.Others noted that Nvidia's success was remarkable, because it primarily provides products and services to other companies rather than directly to consumers.Among Nvidia's more prominent investors is U.S Rep. and former Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi, whose investment in Nvidia has so far netted her $4 million, according to Unusual Whales.“[Pelosi] is up over 210% in 197 days and [has] still not sold her calls,” Unusual Whales wrote. “Pelosi has made twenty times her salary. Her portfolio is near all-time highs, up 93%.”Edited by Ryan Ozawa.Generally Intelligent NewsletterA weekly AI journey narrated by Gen, a generative AI model.

Analyst Says Blue-Chip Altcoin Could Hit New All-Time Highs Shortly, Updates Outlook on Three Additional Coins - The Daily Hodl


								A widely followed crypto analyst believes one top-10 altcoin by market capitalization could soon hit new all-time highs (ATHs).
Pseudonymous crypto trader Altcoin Sherpa tells his 216,700 followers on the social media platform X that BNB, the native token of the BNB Chain, continues to have a strong market structure.










“BNB: slow and steady wins the race. This thing goes to ATH shortly. Wish I still had a bag of it, sold it during the bear market. Hard times then.”
Source: Altcoin Sherpa/X
Looking at his daily chart, the trader suggests that BNB is about to flip the upper bound of a trading range at $621.50 into support and continue higher.
BNB is trading for $669 at time of writing, up more than 7% in the last 24 hours. BNB reached an ATH of $686 on May 10th, 2021.
Next up, the trader is long-term bullish on Bittensor (TAO), a decentralized blockchain platform that focuses on machine learning and artificial intelligence (AI).
However, he warns TAO needs to hold the key level of $350 as support or it could collapse in value.
“TAO: I would like to see this continue chopping around $350-$500 for a bit to form a solid bottom. This is likely to take weeks and this is the time period to scale in. Obviously if $350 gets lost, this thing is going to sub-$300 quickly.”
Source: Altcoin Sherpa/X
TAO is trading for $392 at time of writing, up nearly 4% in the last 24 hours.
Next up, the trader says My Neighbor Alice (ALICE), a non-fungible token (NFT) play-to-earn video game, could revisit lower Fibonacci levels before bouncing.
“ALICE: if scalping, I think taking a quick trade at .382 and .50 are decent setups. $2.13 and $2.03 are reasonable areas to bid in the short term and should provide a bounce.”
Source: Altcoin Sherpa/X
ALICE is trading for $2.15 at time of writing, down more than 10% in the last 24 hours.
Lastly, the trader says that NOT, a community token for the popular Telegram-based tap-to-earn mining game Notcoin, may have formed a market bottom after bouncing from $0.0199.

NOT is trading for $0.0240 at time of writing, up 8% in the last 24 hours.

Shiba Inu Investors Beware: Lead Dev Sounds Critical Warning On Dangerous Scam | Bitcoinist.com


								A lead developer of the doggy-themed meme coin, Shiba Inu has issued a critical warning to SHIB community members about an ongoing scam attack involving one of SHIB’s native tokens, TREAT. 
Scam Attackers Launch Fake TREAT Token
On June 2, a Shiba Inu member identified as ‘Digarch’ shared a screenshot of a scam alert issued by Shiba Inu’s lead developer, DaVinci, on X (formerly Twitter). Alongside this alert, Digarch released a stern warning, urging the SHIB Army to exercise extreme caution during this volatile period.

The screenshot released by Digarch originated from SHIB’S official discord account, a platform regularly used for updates and daily discussions about the Shiba Inu ecosystem. In his message to the Shiba Inu community, DaVinci raised serious concerns about the listing and distribution of fraudulent tokens falsely claiming association with the SHIB ecosystem, its developers, and the Shibarium project. 
DaVinci’s statement revealed that “deceitful individuals” have launched a fake TREAT token, under the guise of being directly involved with the SHIB ecosystem. These fake tokens are currently listed on popular crypto platforms such asCoinMarketCap and crypto exchanges like CoinGecko. 
Informing community members of these malicious activities, the Shiba Inu developer has advised SHIB members to practice caution and conduct thorough research before investing or engaging in any tokens. He disclosed that the malicious actors have changed their scam tactics, initially misusing Ryoshi Research mediums, but now illicitly exploiting Shiba Inu State and Canine code.  
Disturbingly, these scam attackers have also integrated the official SHIBwebsite address, shib.io, into their promotional scam videos to bolster the credibility of their false claims and illegal schemes.
DaVinci has explicitly clarified that the SHIB native token, TREAT, has not yet been launched. Therefore, any tokens claiming to be Treat or associated with Treat are fraudulent and intended to fleece and deceive SHIBcommunity members. Engaging with these fraudulent tokens could result in severe financial consequences, as they are not affiliated with the Shiba Inu ecosystem, and have any intrinsic value or strong community backing it.  
The Shiba Inu developer has acknowledged that due to ShibaSwap’s decentralized nature, bans on the fake TREAT token cannot be enforced. However, to protect the SHIB community members, the team will persist in unequivocally expressing their disapproval of these malicious individuals and their unsavory scam practices.
About tHE Shiba Inu Real TREAT Token
The real Shiba Inu TREAT token is part of the ecosystem’s utility tokens, SHIB, LEASH, SHI, and BONE. While each token has a distinct function within the Shiba Inu ecosystem and Shibarium network, TREAT was specifically designed to enhance liquidity for the SHI stablecoin and serve as a reward token like BONE for the crypto exchange ShibaSwap. 

According to official reports from SHIB’s lead marketing member, Lucie, the TREAT token is still in the development phase and has not been released. Despite rumors suggesting that the SHIB token was launched in 2023, Lucie has debunked these claims in a previous X post, clarifying that TREAT has not been introduced yet.
“TreatsforShib, aka $TREAT from SHIB.IO, has NOT been released yet. I’ve noticed some confused journalists posting that it was released in 2023. NO, IT WASN’T,” Lucie stated. 
The Shiba Inu marketing lead has also urged community members to stay alert and always verify information from SHIB’s official website or its account on Discord.

Is $100K Bitcoin Inevitable? This Expert Say 'Yes'-Find Out When


																As Bitcoin teeters close to its previous peak, discussions about its next big price targets have reignited. Among the voices contributing to this conversation is Samson Mow, the CEO of Jan3 and a prominent Bitcoin advocate.
Recently, on X (formerly Twitter), Mow expressed his belief in Bitcoin’s imminent rise to $100,000, a milestone he sees as a stepping stone toward an eventual value of $1 million. His forecast is based on events triggered by breaking past the all-time high of $73,750 in March.

	Related Reading


Critical Factors To Drive Bitcoin Price To $100k Target
Mow outlines a cause-and-effect scenario that could catapult Bitcoin to these new heights.
First, surpassing the previous all-time high would initiate a “recursive Bitcoin demand shock,” as increased demand and limited supply drive prices upward rapidly. According to Mow, this chain reaction could swiftly elevate Bitcoin to the $100,000 mark.

His confidence is mirrored in the recent market behavior. Despite a minor pullback from its 24-hour peak of $71,312, Bitcoin has maintained an upward trajectory, gaining 1.7% in the past 24 hours and nearly 5% over the past week.
BTC price is moving sideways on the 4-hour chart. Source: BTC/USDT on TradingView.com
Supporting Mow’s optimistic outlook, Chris Vermeulen, Chief Market Strategist of The Technical Traders.com, shares a technical perspective that aligns with Mow’s predictions.
In a detailed analysis, Vermeulen pointed out a cup and handle formation on the chart, a bullish signal suggesting significant potential for an upward breakout. He uses Fibonacci extensions to project that Bitcoin could soon reach targets of $80,000 to $90,000, possibly climbing as high as $106,000.
Market Dynamics And Long-Term Prospects
Both experts view the current market dynamics as a prelude to more substantial gains. Vermeulen’s analysis not only supports Mow’s prediction but extends it by suggesting that Bitcoin could encounter resistance around $100,000, a psychological barrier likely to prompt significant market reactions.
Beyond this point, a consolidation phase might occur, but the long-term trajectory remains overwhelmingly positive. The broader financial context also plays a critical role in these forecasts.

With growing concerns about the stability of traditional assets like the dollar and the stock market, investors are increasingly turning to alternatives like BTC and gold. This shift indicates a deeper financial narrative where Bitcoin is not just seen as a speculative asset but as a viable hedge against economic uncertainty.

VanEck predicts Ethereum will hit $22,000 per token by 2030

VanEck believes Ethereum (ETH) will be worth roughly $22,000 by 2030, the asset manager said in a comprehensive analysis published on June 5.The forecast, developed by the firm’s Digital Assets Research team, led by Matthew Sigel, highlights Ethereum’s strong growth potential within both traditional and cryptocurrency-focused portfolios.VanEck’s analysis attributes the optimistic price target to Ethereum’s expanding role as a high-growth, internet-native commercial system that could disrupt traditional financial sectors and Big Tech platforms.The report emphasized Ethereum’s significant user base and economic activity, noting that the network currently supports approximately 20 million monthly active users, facilitates $4 trillion in annual settlement value, and oversees $308 billion in digital assets.$2 trillion market capVanEck’s valuation model for ETH is based on a forecast of $66 billion in free cash flows — the amount of money generated by a blockchain network — by 2030, with a 33x valuation multiple on those cash flows.The model considers Ethereum’s potential to disrupt various business sectors, including finance, marketing, infrastructure, and artificial intelligence (AI).According to the report, the Ethereum network is poised to capture substantial market share from traditional financial markets and technology giants.If Ethereum maintains its dominance among smart contract platforms, VanEck sees a credible path to generating $66 billion in free cash flow — the amount of money generated by a blockchain network — for token holders — supporting a $2.2 trillion market capitalization and a $22,000 price per ETH by 2030.Revolutionary assetThe company emphasized ETH’s broad use cases, stating:“We believe ETH is a revolutionary asset with few parallels in the non-crypto financial world.”VanEck cited ETH’s role as “digital oil” consumed in on-chain use and called it “programmable money and a yield-bearing commodity.”It also referred to ETH as an internet reserve currency that prices activity and assets in Ethereum’s $1 billion ecosystem and connecting blockchains.According to the report, Ethereum generated $3.4 billion in revenue over the past year, surpassing some web2 apps like Etsy, Twitch, and Roblox. Meanwhile, its 20 million monthly active users surpass Instacart, Robinhood, and Vrbo.VanEck added that ETH offers cost-saving features, better interconnectivity for social applications, the opportunity to share earnings with end users, and a basis for AI applications.Investment risksWhile the report is optimistic about Ethereum’s future, it also emphasizes several risks associated with investing in ETH.One major concern is Ethereum’s reliance on speculative activities, which could lead to significant downside risk if market sentiment shifts.Regulatory changes pose another risk, as they could classify ETH as a security, thereby imposing stringent legal requirements on Ethereum-based businesses. The competitive landscape is also a threat, with emerging technologies like Solana challenging its market dominance.Additionally, government actions to control non-sovereign financial systems could negatively impact Ethereum’s growth prospects.Mentioned in this articleLatest Alpha Market Report

Bitcoin DeFi security concerns still lurk, says Fireblocks executive - Crypto Briefing


            
            
                            
            
                            
            
            A Bitcoin (BTC) decentralized ecosystem has been in rapid development in 2024, with its total value locked (TVL) jumping 263% so far and surpassing $1 billion, according to data aggregator DefiLlama. Nevertheless, as a nascent sector where builders try to create applications compatible with other blockchains, new security issues might surface while it grows. Shahar Madar, VP of Security and Trust at Fireblocks, shared with Crypto Briefing his insights on Bitcoin decentralized application risks and how mature the security of the decentralized finance (DeFi) ecosystem is.Crypto Briefing – Did you find any issues with the different applications built on top of Bitcoin that raised your concern?Shahar Madar – I would say this is very early on. Although I think there are many conversations about Bitcoin DeFi, I’m not sure we are at the stage where it’s as adopted as it could be. Bitcoin is definitely a staple of the blockchain industry and the blockchain ecosystem. We see Wrapped Bitcoin as one of the important tokens, and our customers use it a lot.On DeFi over Bitcoin, personally, I feel it’s too early to tell. Usually, the way you see this kind of thing is that you iterate pretty quickly with different implementations. We’ve seen this. We see this even with account abstraction. We see this with some technologies that have been spoken about for a very long time. So because this place is very innovation-driven, there’s going to be usually many iterations. I don’t know if that’s specific to Bitcoin DeFi, but usually, this kind of thing evolves over time. We only find the core issues or points of pain when people start using it.Crypto Briefing – Recent studies show that private key compromises are the most recurring and damaging attack vectors in the crypto industry. Do you think it will become an even bigger threat?Shahar Madar – So since day one, one of the core values that Fireblocks offered for institutions and honestly any organization, any business, is the ability to securely manage their operations, and their keys, and onboard safely and securely to blockchains on one side. So this part of private key compromise that many people are experiencing, I feel is strongly mitigated by the fact of how we generate keys, and how we store the keys for our customers. The way our self-cultivated platform works is that we leverage MPC and essentially break down the private key into three different parts, each of them being held at a different security safe, so it’s impossible to take out. I also want to add other significant threats we see today. One of them is the extension of the first one we’re talking about, which is securing custody of keys. And that is the orchestration and management of smart contracts. We are at a point where people trick with social engineering and scam out of private keys from contract managers, owners, and admins. When this security process is done with our tokenization platform on top of Fireblocks, you obviously are in much better shape, because you know everything goes through our security user management, and secure policy engine, which dictates the authorization flow. If there’s a sensitive operation related to the smart contract you manage, and I’m saying as a DeFi protocol owner, as a token manager, and as a stablecoin issuer, you can do this as well through the Fireblocks platform. I feel this mitigates a lot of this risk for private key compromises.Another attack vector is rogue employees, insiders either being rogue going against you or being hacked and attackers leveraging their access and privilege against you. This is the extension of the private key management.We’ve also extended our DeFi security offering, and this is more meant for people who are doing on-chain trading and on-chain operations. Essentially, it extends what we offer to them the ability to authorize sensitive operations with smart contracts and dApps. We’ve extended this because one threat that we’re seeing is phishing dApps, scams that impersonate legitimate decentralized applications, or just plain malicious smart contracts, which are altogether targeting traders.We’ve launched this new suite of features, essentially scanning every dApp connection you make through the Fireblocks platform, scanning every interaction you have with a smart contract, and simulating every control call that you have, so you can get a sense of what is the expected outcome. You can get more comfortable and you know what’s going to happen once you approve it. And we’ve integrated that into the entire operation flow that we know institutions that use Fireblocks go through. Crypto Briefing – Do you believe the new institutions entering the crypto market now are aware of how to make proper custody? Do they prefer to have their own custody team, or are they keen to work with companies such as Fireblocks?Shahar Madar – Absolutely. These institutions understand, they go into a space after a thorough examination and due diligence. They know there’s an opportunity for them, but they also are very educated about cybersecurity in general. A lot of them, when they come to us, they also want to learn.So they’re looking to partner with someone who’s an expert in this field. They always have a security team, but always, nine out of 10 times, they understand it’s better to partner and leverage existing technology than to build their own. Most people don’t grow their own tomatoes, they don’t need to invent the wheel. If there’s a great battle-tested technology and Fireblocks is definitely one, you should use it and be on top of it. We do invest a lot and we work very closely with our big enterprise institutions that either examine the market or go all in and use Fireblocks. We help them with education, we help them to understand the best practices we use in Fireblocks and their entire business around that. Finally, we also listen to them. It’s part of the reason why we offer many customizations and many different deployment models because we understand that what’s fitting for a very small business, a very small startup consisting of three guys and a dog, is not the same thing that suits a big institution.Crypto Briefing – From the previous bull cycle to this one, which is just starting, do you see any significant developments in crypto security?Shahar Madar – It’s a cat-and-mouse game with attackers. We are, as Fireblocks and as the industry as a whole, pushing forward for wider adoption, for better security standards. And we’ve gone a very long way since inception. And attackers are always trying to get at us, right? They always try to push forward. They try to find new ways to get in and it’s our job as people who work in a block of security ecosystem to keep chasing them, to keep blocking them, research, and investigate what they do. I think we are doing overall as an industry better than we were two, three, four, five years ago. But also, on the other hand, we’re seeing the exploiters changing, evolving, and trying to get ahead of the latest protections and defenses that people put out. It’s a never-ending game. You have to keep researching, tracking, and improving. And to a point about the role of blocking security firms in the space, I think it’s a big part of that. You need to keep and stay on top of the latest threats. And if you’re not, and if you’re just using the same technology you built half a decade ago, you’re not going to keep people secure.

Former OpenAI Safety Researcher Says ‘Security Was Not Prioritized’ - Decrypt

Former OpenAI safety researcher Leopold Aschenbrenner says that security practices at the company were "egregiously insufficient." In a video interview with Dwarkesh Patel posted Tuesday, Aschenbrenner spoke of internal conflicts over priorities, suggesting a shift in focus towards rapid growth and deployment of AI models at the expense of safety.He also said he was fired for putting his concerns in writing.In a wide-ranging, four-hour conversation, Aschenbrenner told Patel that he penned an internal memo last year detailing his concerns and circulated it among reputable experts from outside the company. However, after a major security incident occurred weeks later, he said he decided to share an updated memo with a couple of board members. He was quickly released from OpenAI."What might also be helpful context is the kinds of questions they asked me when they fired me... the questions were about my views on AI progress, on AGI, the appropriate level of security for AGI, whether the government should be involved in AGI, whether I and the superalignment team were loyal to the company, and what I was up to during the OpenAI board events," Aschenbrenner said.AGI, or artificial general intelligence, is when AI meets or exceeds human intelligence across any field, regardless of how it was trained.Loyalty to the company—or to Sam Altman—emerged as a key factor after his brief ouster: over 90% of employees signed a letter threatening to quit in solidarity with him. They also popularized the slogan, “OpenAI is nothing without its people.”“I didn’t sign the employee letter during the board events, despite pressure to do so,” Aschenbrenner recalled.The superalignment team—led by Ilya Sutskever and Jan Leike—was in charge of building long-term safety practices to make sure AI remains aligned with human expectations.The departure of prominent members of that team, including Sutskever and Leike, brought added scrutiny. The whole team was subsequently dissolved, and a new safety team was announced… led by CEO Sam Altman, who is also a member of the OpenAI board to which it reports.Aschenbrenner said OpenAI's actions contradict its public statements about safety."Another example is when I raised security issues—they would tell me security is our number one priority,” he stated. “Invariably, when it came time to invest serious resources or make trade-offs to take basic measures, security was not prioritized.”This is in line with statements from Leike, who said the team was “sailing against the wind” and that “safety culture and processes have taken a backseat to shiny products” under Altman’s leadership.Aschenbrenner also expressed concerns about AGI development, stressing the importance of a cautious approach—particularly as many fear China is pushing hard to surpass the United States in AGI research.China "is going to have an all-out effort to infiltrate American AI labs, billions of dollars, thousands of people... [they're] going to try and outbuild us,” he said. "What will be at stake will not just be cool products, but whether liberal democracy survives.”Just a few weeks ago, it was revealed that OpenAI required its employees to sign abusive non-disclosure agreements (NDAs) that prevented them from speaking out about the company’s safety practices.Aschenbrenner said he didn’t sign such an NDA, but said that he was offered around $1M in equity.In response to these growing concerns, a collective of nearly a dozen current and former OpenAI employees have meanwhile signed an open letter demanding the right to call out company misdeeds without fear of retaliation.The letter—endorsed by industry figures like Yoshua Bengio, Geoffrey Hinton, and Stuart Russell—emphasizes the need for AI companies to commit to transparency and accountability.“So long as there is no effective government oversight of these corporations, current and former employees are among the few people who can hold them accountable to the public—yet broad confidentiality agreements block us from voicing our concerns, except to the very companies that may be failing to address these issues,” the letter reads. “Ordinary whistleblower protections are insufficient because they focus on illegal activity, whereas many of the risks we are concerned about are not yet regulated.“Some of us reasonably fear various forms of retaliation, given the history of such cases across the industry,” it continues. “We are not the first to encounter or speak about these issues.”After news of the restrictive employment clauses spread, Sam Altman claimed he was unaware of the situation and assured the public his legal team was working to fix the issue.“There was a provision about potential equity cancellation in our previous exit docs; although we never clawed anything back, it should never have been something we had in any documents or communication,” he tweeted. “This is on me and one of the few times I've been genuinely embarrassed running OpenAI; I did not know this was happening and I should have.”OpenAI says it has since released all employees from the contentious non-disparagement agreements and removed the clause from its departure paperwork.OpenAI did not respond to a request for comment from Decrypt.Generally Intelligent NewsletterA weekly AI journey narrated by Gen, a generative AI model.

Spanish Court Grants Bail To 'Bitcoin Jesus' Roger Ver Amid Extradition Requests | Bitcoinist.com


								In a significant legal development, Roger Ver, an early investor in Bitcoin, who has been indicted by the US Department of Justice (DOJ) on multiple charges, including mail fraud and tax evasion, has been released on bail by a Spanish court amid extradition requests from US authorities. 
 Tax Evasion In Connection With Bitcoin Fortune
According to a Bloomberg report, Ver’s arrest in late April in Spain led to his release on May 17, after posting €150,000 ($163,000) in bail. However, he was required to surrender his passport, remain in Spain, and appear in court every two days. The prosecutor’s subsequent appeal against Ver’s release was rejected two weeks later.

The US DOJ indictment notes that Roger Ver, who earned the nickname “Bitcoin Jesus” for his early advocacy of Bitcoin, is accused of acquiring Bitcoin for himself and his companies as early as 2011, amassing a substantial fortune in the cryptocurrency. 
Ver allegedly failed to report capital gains or pay taxes on his Bitcoin holdings despite selling Bitcoins for approximately €240 million in 2017. The indictment alleges Ver concealed these transactions from his accountant, evading tax obligations.
To complicate matters, Roger Ver renounced his US citizenship in 2014 through eviction, becoming a St. Kitts and Nevis citizen. However, US law still required him to disclose and pay taxes on capital gains from his global assets, including his Bitcoin holdings. 
The indictment also claims that Ver provided false or misleading information to his legal representatives and appraisers, understating the value of his companies and Bitcoin holdings. This resulted in the filing of “false tax returns” that significantly undervalued his assets and evaded substantial tax obligations.
US Authorities Pursue Roger Ver’s Extradition
According to the report, US authorities are actively seeking Ver’s extradition to face tax fraud charges. The Justice Department alleges that Ver failed to pay at least $48 million in taxes from his Bitcoin transactions and that his assets were consequently undervalued. 
Roger Ver’s legal counsel, Jaime Campaner, has stated that Ver has been in contact with US authorities through his Californian lawyers, emphasizing that his arrest seemed unnecessary given his cooperation.

The case against Ver underscores the increasing scrutiny and regulatory measures applied to the cryptocurrency industry. 
As digital currencies grow in prominence and value, governments worldwide are stepping up enforcement actions against platforms and key individuals to ensure compliance with tax and financial regulations.

This iPhone Challenger Could Transform Smartphones by Trading Apps for AI - Decrypt

London-based electronics maker Nothing wants to revolutionize smartphones, ditching conventional apps in favor of a fully AI-managed interface."The way we use our smartphones needs to be redefined,” Nothing CEO Carl Pei declared on Twitter. “The current user experience hasn't evolved for more than a decade… the next era needs a highly personalized, dynamic, and cross-device interface.”Pei is betting on AI as the best way to get there, which he said will bring smartphone user interfaces that are completely different from the ones we know today. He shared a preview of what the next Nothing smartphone might look like, straying far from the typical grid of apps and widgets.“We have been exploring ways of deeply integrating AI into the operative system,” said Walid, a designer at Nothing featured in a video shared by Pei. “We tried to reimagine the home screen—we wanted to move away from it just being a launcher into becoming more of a hub of contextual, relevant information.”In “tomorrow's post-app world,” Nothing proposes that users will simply interact with AI, asking it to do everything. The AI assistant would then coordinate any required applications in the background to complete requests without requiring any further interaction from the user.Nothing’s idea, he said, is to provide every user with a “highly personalized companion that feels almost like a best friend.”Walid demonstrated the AI assistant setup, where the system asked for personality traits he valued in a companion. After saying he liked people who are fun, thoughtful, and have a good sense of humor, the assistant introduced itself as Oliver.“We’ve all been playing internally with this prototype for the past week or so,” he reported. “We all managed to get different companions that seem uniquely tailored to each one of us.”Pei asserted that his company is ready to compete in the red-hot AI space."Over the last 3.5 years, we’ve been busy establishing our end to end capabilities... and as we reach stability and with solid growth plans, we’re ready to shift gears,“ he said. “See this as us throwing our hat into the consumer AI race."Nothing’s companion seemed quite similar to ChatGPT's voice chatbot —at least per the preview: A flat circle in a black background with a pleasant, human-like voice. However, Nothing didn’t reveal whether this assistant will run locally or in the cloud. Given the computing power required to run similar AI tools, however, it is likely to be a cloud-dependent feature.Image: Carl Pei/TwitterPei started Nothing in 2021 after leaving Chinese electronics manufacturer OnePlus, which had entered the smartphone market in 2014 with the $300 OnePlus One. The first phone from Nothing was released in 2022, priced under $500 and running a customized version of Google’s Android operating system.The Nothing Phone (2) moved solidly toward the high-end of the smartphone market, gunning for Apple, Google and Samsung with a $600 flagship device that earned rave reviews. Last month, a more modestly configured Nothing Phone (2a) went on sale for $350.It’s unclear whether the re-imagined interface Pei shared today will be part of the yet unannounced Nothing Phone (3), but he did say it would be released in 2025.Image: Carl Pei/TwitterPei didn’t share any additional details about the upcoming device, so its design, specs, and features remain unknown. Hardware enthusiast sites and forums predict that it may adopt an upgraded Snapdragon 8 processor, along with upgrades to its camera module and a bigger battery. But the key to Pei’s pitch is the overhauled user interface."We've come a long way, being the only company that built a smartphone business in the last 10 years,” he said. “We've also developed a creative culture in the company that emphasizes great UX and thoughtful integration between software and hardware."Meanwhile, other smartphone companies are already incorporating AI features into their devices. The Google Pixel lineup—with new Google Tensor chips—is incorporating on-device Large Language Models (LLM), while the Samsung Galaxy S24 Ultra, with its Galaxy AI, is offering features like Live Translate and Circle to Search.Smartphones featuring the new Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 processor, like the Xiaomi 14 and new Motorola models, also offer AI-powered features.Ultimately, the best way to carry AI with you might very well be the ubiquitous smartphone rather than a specialized device. The Humane AI pin was criticized for its lack of practicality, huge latency, and low accuracy. The better-received Rabbit R1 has turned out to be mostly powered by an app that runs scripts in the cloud. And the promised Limitless AI pendant has yet to prove its value.Edited by Ryan Ozawa.Generally Intelligent NewsletterA weekly AI journey narrated by Gen, a generative AI model.

Crypto Investors Rejoice: Turkey Declares No Taxes On Digital Gains


								In a notable announcement, Turkey’s Treasury and Finance Minister Mehmet Simsek has clarified that the government does not plan to impose taxes on profits derived from “stocks and cryptocurrencies.”
This decision reflects a broader strategy to “foster” investment and growth in financial markets in the region without the burden of direct taxation on gains.
Tax Strategies And Crypto Regulatory Innovations In Turkey’s Financial Markets
While Turkey has disclosed its no tax plan for digital gains, the government is reported to be still exploring the implementation of a “very limited” transaction tax on these assets, the specifics of which have yet to be detailed.
This approach aligns with Minister Simsek’s philosophy of ensuring comprehensive taxation to promote “justice and efficiency.” However, concerns have been raised about the potential impact of even a minimal tax on market dynamics.
Although limited, Mehmet Gerz, CEO of Ata Portfoy, argues that any tax on stock transactions could inadvertently introduce “inefficiencies, raise commission costs, and ultimately deter trading activities.”
This perspective highlights the delicate balance policymakers must navigate to enhance revenue without stifling economic activity.
The decision to keep stock and cryptocurrency profits untaxed comes as Turkey nears the completion of its regulatory framework for cryptocurrencies. This framework is a pivotal development for the country’s financial technology landscape.
Minister Simsek has indicated that these regulations are primarily aimed at enhancing the security of crypto trading and aligning with international standards to address money laundering and terrorism financing—key factors for Turkey’s objective to be removed from the Financial Action Task Force’s (FATF) grey list.
The new regulations will introduce a licensing system for crypto trading platforms overseen by Turkey’s Capital Markets Board (CMB). This system will set minimum operating standards, including qualifications for founders and managers and organizational and capital requirements.
These measures are expected to provide a “safer and more structured” market environment, contributing positively to the sector’s “stability and growth.”
Industry Reaction And Future Prospects
The industry’s response has been cautiously optimistic. Mucahit Donmez, CEO of Binance Turkey, recently expressed support for the regulatory directions, particularly the emphasis on security, capital adequacy, and operational standards for crypto platforms.
According to Donmez, these regulations will significantly benefit the sector by ensuring “better protection” for users’ assets and establishing clear operational criteria.
As Turkey moves forward with these regulations, the region has the potential to become a significant hub for digital finance growth.
Regulatory clarity and the absence of profit taxes could attract more investors and companies to the Turkish markets, contributing to the country’s economic resilience and technological advancement.
With these strategic moves, Turkey is positioning itself as a leading player in the global digital economy. It aims to leverage its geographic and economic position to bridge various financial ecosystems across Europe and Asia.

Crypto Analyst Predicts $1,000 for BNB After Price Surges Past $700 | Cryptoglobe


                                
The price of the native token of the BNB Chain, $BNB, has recently seen its price soar to surpass the $700 mark for the first time ever, rising over 7% in a day amid a wider cryptocurrency market rally. A popular crypto analyst has now suggested BNB could top $1,000.



BNB is at the time of writing trading at $697 after enduring a slight correction from a new all-time high above the $712 mark, and popular cryptocurrency analyst Sheldon The Sniper has said that BNB’s price chart is “looking extremely bullish,” and pointed to $1,000 as its next price target.







Another popular cryptocurrency analyst, Kaleo, has said that while the market is paying attention to Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Solana, Binance’s BNB is “entering price discovery,” and pointed out the cryptocurrency “was an early leader of the last bull market as well.”



Per his words, history “doesn’t always repeat itself, but it often rhymes.” BNB’s price rally comes shortly after Changpeng Zhao, the founder and former CEO of leading cryptocurrency exchange Binance – which is itself behind BNB – started serving a four-month prison sentence in California after pleading guilty in November to violating the Bank Secrecy Act for failing to implement adequate safeguards against money laundering at Binance.







            
            

            
            

            
            

        

Ted Zhang, an associate portfolio manager at Revere Asset Management, also pointed to BNB’s chart on social media and said that it “doesn’t get better than this,” and added “these are the setups that you want to find yourself in. They are SCREAMING at you and JUMPING off the page.”

BNB’s upward movement also comes shortly after the leading cryptocurrency exchange Binance announced its “largest ever rewards pool” in the Binance World Championship, an event in which its users will be competing in skills-based tournaments.

VanEck Forecasts Ethereum to Hit $22,000 to $154,000 by 2030


VanEck, a leading asset manager, has boldly predicted that Ethereum (ETH) will reach $22,000 per coin by 2030. This projection stems from the anticipated approval of spot Ethereum exchange-traded funds (ETFs).
According to the firm, such approval would enable financial advisors and institutional investors to hold Ethereum securely and benefit from improved pricing and liquidity. This potential market development shows cryptocurrencies’ growing acceptance and integration into traditional financial systems.
Ethereum’s Growth and Value Proposition According to VanEck

VanEck has updated its financial model to evaluate ETH’s investment case. It highlights Ethereum’s impressive value proposition. The model points to significant contributions from various sectors, including finance, banking, payments, marketing, advertising, social gaming, infrastructure, and artificial intelligence.
Ethereum’s open-source nature fosters innovation and connectivity among applications, offering unique value propositions not found in traditional platforms. This advantage positions Ethereum as a disruptive force capable of attracting substantial market share from established financial and tech giants.

“Should [Ethereum] do so while maintaining its dominant position among smart contract platforms, we see a credible path to $66 billion in free cash flow to token holders supporting a $2.2 trillion asset by 2030,” VanEck wrote.


Moreover, VanEck sees ETH offering investors exposure to a high-growth, internet-native commercial system. The firm analyzed key Ethereum metrics, including 20 million monthly active users and $4 trillion in transactions. Over the past year, Ethereum also facilitated $5.5 trillion in stablecoin transfers.

“The centerpiece asset of this financial system is the ETH token, and in our updated base case, we believe it to be worth $22,000 by 2030, representing a total return of 487% from today’s ETH price, a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 37.8%,” the firm stated.

The $22,000 price prediction is based on the base case. VanEck’s analysts estimate that Ethereum could reach $154,000 in a bull case and $360 in a bear case.

However, ETH’s valuation remains susceptible to several risks. These include speculation, regulatory changes, interest rate fluctuations, competition from other blockchain platforms, and geopolitical factors.
Indeed, the potential approval of spot Ethereum ETF has sparked fresh interest in the crypto market. In late May, the British banking giant Standard Chartered made a bullish prediction on Ethereum’s future price.

Geoff Kendrick, Head of FX Research and Digital Assets Research at Standard Chartered, predicted that ETH could reach $8,000 by the end of 2024. Assuming the bank’s estimated Bitcoin (BTC) price level of $200,000 by the end of 2025, this could imply an Ethereum price of $14,000 by then. Kendrick also predicted that spot ETFs could attract an influx of 2.39 – 9.15 million ETH in the first 12 months following approval.

“In US dollar terms, that equates to roughly $15 billion to $45 billion,” he said.

Bloomberg’s analysts anticipate that the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) could approve spot Ethereum ETFs between the end of June and early July.

Bitcoin Surges Past $71,000, But TD Sequential Says 'Sell'


																The Tom Demark (TD) Sequential has given a sell signal for Bitcoin after the asset broke past the $71,000 level in the past day.
Bitcoin TD Sequential Is Giving A Sell Signal Right Now
As explained by analyst Ali Martinez in a new post on X, a TD Sequential signal has appeared in the 1-hour price of Bitcoin. The “TD Sequential” refers to an indicator in technical analysis (TA) that’s generally used for locating probable points of reversal in any commodity’s price.
The TD Sequential involves two phases: setup and countdown. During the first of these, candles of the same polarity (that is, whether red or green) are counted to nine. After these nine candles are in, the asset may be assumed to have encountered a turnaround.

	Related Reading


Naturally, if the candles leading up to the setup’s completion were red, the TD Sequential would give a buy signal for the asset. On the other hand, green candles would imply a potential reversal towards the downside.
After the setup is over, the countdown phase begins. This second phase of the indicator is much like the first one, except for the fact that the number of candles to be counted here is thirteen rather than nine. The countdown’s completion implies that the price has encountered another likely point of reversal.
A TD Sequential phase of the former type has recently been completed in the 1-hour price of Bitcoin. Below is the chart shared by Ali that shows this pattern in cryptocurrency.

From the graph, it’s visible that TD Sequential has recently finished its setup phase with green candles for Bitcoin. This signal comes as the coin has surged beyond the $71,000 level for the first time since mid-May.
This TD setup would mean that the party could already be over for now as the coin may have reached a local top, and a reversal to the down direction could be coming.
While the TD Sequential could spell a worry for BTC in the short-term, another TA indicator could point towards a bullish outcome for the asset instead. As CryptoQuant author Axel Adler Jr has pointed out in an X post,  the Bitcoin Relative Strength Index (RSI) is at a level where recent uptrends have begun.

The RSI tracks the magnitude of recent changes in the price of any given asset. As the chart shows, the 14-day RSI currently has a value of 56% for BTC.

Usually, the price is considered to be undervalued when this metric drops below 30%. Strangely, the last three major uptrends in BTC began when the RSI had a value of 56%. This could be a coincidence, but BTC could see a sharp surge soon if it’s truly a pattern.
BTC Price
Despite the appearance of the TD Sequential, Bitcoin hasn’t let off yet, as the asset has climbed beyond $71,600.

Binance Counters $13 Billion Lawsuit: Pursues Size Reduction In UK Legal Showdown | Bitcoinist.com


								In a recent development, cryptocurrency exchange Binance has moved to dismiss the majority of a £10 billion ($12.8 billion) lawsuit filed in London, as reported by Reuters. 
The lawsuit, being heard at the Competition Appeal Tribunal (CAT), accuses Binance and other exchanges of conspiring to “delist” the Bitcoin Satoshi Vision (BSV) cryptocurrency.
BSV Delisting Controversy
The case, brought on behalf of over 200,000 BSV coin owners, alleges that Binance and other exchanges engaged in “anti-competitive behavior” by delisting the BSV token in 2019. 

Lawyers representing BSV Claims, the entity pursuing the case, contend that the delisting caused a significant drop in BSV’s value and hindered its potential to become a “top tier” cryptocurrency, leading to a claim valued at up to £9 billion.
While Binance has not opposed the case’s certification under the UK’s collective proceedings regime, the exchange has requested the CAT to dismiss the part of the lawsuit about BSV’s alleged potential as a major cryptocurrency. This particular aspect of the case represents individuals who retained their BSV holdings after it was delisted.
Binance’s Legal Arguments
Binance’s legal representative, Brian Kennelly, argued that those holding onto BSV made “a voluntary decision” and could have chosen to sell it and invest in comparable cryptocurrencies. BSV Claims’ lawyers, however, contended that the issue should proceed to trial along with the rest of the case.
When approached for comment by Reuters, Binance declined to provide a statement on the ongoing litigation. A spokesperson for Kraken, another exchange named in the lawsuit, dismissed the claims as “baseless.”
Per the report, the decision to delist BSV by Binance, Kraken, and other exchanges in 2019 was partly triggered by assertions by Australian computer scientist Craig Wright, who claimed to be the pseudonymous inventor of Bitcoin, known as “Satoshi Nakamoto.” 
In a separate legal proceeding earlier this year, Wright was found to have lied and forged documents supporting his false claim. Wright has expressed his intention to appeal against the ruling.

The lawsuit’s outcome could affect Binance, the other exchanges, and the wider crypto community. As the proceedings continue, stakeholders will closely watch the developments and subsequent decisions made by the Competition Appeal Tribunal.

As of the time of writing, the exchange’s native token, BNB, is trading at $700, following a 17% surge in the past seven days to reach the $715 milestone. This recent peak represents a new all-time high for the BNB token.

Shiba Inu Accumulation: Whale Splashes $18 Million on Billions of SHIB | Cryptoglobe


                                
Amid the ongoing memecoin crazy a massive cryptocurrency investor has recently started heavily accumulating Shiba Inu ($SHIB), pouring millions onto the meme-inspired cryptocurrency to accumulate billions of tokens.



That’s according to on-chain analysis service Lookonchain, which noted that a successful SHIB investor who has in the past made more than $120 million worth the meme-inspired cryptocurrency has now spent 4,849 ETH worth $18.44 million to buy 715.9 billion SHIB.



The trader, according to the service, has in the past spent $400,000 to buy 5.5 trillion SHIB, which were then subsequently sold for around $121 million over two peaks.







The buying frenzy wasn’t a single act. The whale strategically executed a series of purchases, starting with 149.3 billion SHIB for $3.83 million, followed by a swift addition of 173 billion SHIB. Within a three-hour window, the entity gobbled up a total of 323 billion SHIB tokens, spending an additional $8.29 million.







            
            

            
            

            
            

        

Beyond the whale’s actions, the Shiba Inu ecosystem itself has witnessed significant developments that likely fueled the token’s recent price rise. Shibarium, the Layer-2 scaling solution, has seen notable progress this year, enhancing the network’s capacity to handle a higher volume of transactions efficiently.



Furthermore, the Shibdentity initiative promises a new era of digital identity, while the recently launched Sheboshis NFT collection boasting 20,000 digital avatars on the Ethereum blockchain adds another layer to the Shiba Inu universe.



Further bolstering the ecosystem’s prospects, Shiba Inu secured a $12 million funding round from heavyweights like Polygon Ventures, Mechanism Capital, and Animoca Brands, earmarked for the development of a privacy-focused Layer-3 blockchain. The integration of the Shibaswap decentralized exchange with Shibarium signifies another step towards a more robust and comprehensive ecosystem.



As reported, these developments help SHIB briefly overtake Cardano to become a top 10 cryptocurrency by market capitalization.

Paxos USDL Stablecoin Offering 5% APY Launched - Coincu



	

Key Points:




Paxos introduces Lift Dollar (USDL), a stablecoin offering a 5% daily yield through its UAE-based entity.



Paxos USDL stablecoin, built on Ethereum and backed by U.S. dollars and Treasury notes, is regulated by Abu Dhabi’s Financial Services Regulatory Authority.



USDL launches first in Argentina via crypto platforms Ripio, Buenbit, and TiendaCrypto.




Paxos, a prominent player in the stablecoin market, has launched a new stablecoin named Lift Dollar (USDL) through its UAE-based subsidiary, Paxos International.



Paxos USDL Stablecoin Offering 5% APY Launched 4



Paxos USDL Stablecoin Secured and Regulated by Abu Dhabi Authority



The Paxos USDL stablecoin, pegged to the US dollar, offers a programmatic daily yield of approximately 5%, aligning with returns on US Treasury bonds.



Announced on Wednesday, the USDL is regulated by Abu Dhabi’s Financial Services Regulatory Authority, ensuring stringent oversight. Paxos CEO Charles Cascarilla emphasized that the structure of USDL mirrors that of Paxos’s other stablecoins, including PayPal USD (PYUSD), Pax Dollar (USDP), and Pax Gold (PAXG). Each of these stablecoins is matched 1:1 with the dollar and backed by short-term U.S. government securities, safeguarding assets against potential bankruptcy scenarios.



USDL is built on the Ethereum blockchain, facilitating unrestricted creation and providing daily payouts to token holders. Each USDL token is fully collateralized by the U.S. dollar and secured by cash assets, including U.S. dollar deposits and short-term U.S. Treasury notes. This structure is intended to maintain sufficient reserves to support the total USDL in circulation, thereby reinforcing investor confidence.




Cascarilla highlighted the strategic decision to introduce Paxos USDL stablecoin in jurisdictions with clear regulatory frameworks. In the US, a stablecoin with a pre-programmed yield could be classified as a security by regulators. This approach aims to ensure compliance with diverse rules and regulations globally.



Initial USDL Launch in Argentina via Crypto Platforms



Initially, Paxos International is launching USDL in Argentina through partnerships with crypto platforms Ripio, Buenbit, and TiendaCrypto. This strategic entry point leverages these platforms’ extensive user bases to facilitate adoption.



The move comes after Paxos Trust Company, regulated by the New York Department of Financial Services, ceased offering BUSD, a stablecoin linked to Binance, under regulatory directives last year.

Bitcoin's low volatility will have THIS effect on BTC prices - AMBCrypto



The volatility in the Bitcoin market has declined significantly. 
AxelAdlerJr, in a new report, found that this has dropped to historical levels.

The Bitcoin [BTC] market currently witnesses low volatility, pseudonymous CryptoQuant analyst AxelAdlerJr has found in a new report. 
AxelAdlerJr assessed two of BTC’s key volatility markers and found that they have trended downwards in the past few weeks, suggesting a decline in the possibility of a short-term price swing.
The first metric the analyst observed was BTC’s Garman-Klass Realized Volatility. This metric measures BTC’s price’s historical volatility. It combines the highs, lows, opening, and closing prices of an asset over a specified period to track its volatility during that time. 
According to AxelAdlerJr, BTC’s Garman-Klass Realized Volatility has dropped to 20%. When this metric returns low values, it indicates a decrease in the asset’s price volatility. 
A historical assessment of the indicator revealed that when its value dropped to this low in the past six years, BTC’s price witnessed significant changes.
Further, the analyst considered BTC’s Volatility Index using a 30-day small moving average (SMA). This metric measures the degree of fluctuations in BTC’s price over a specified period. 
Similar to the coin’s Garman-Klass Realized Volatility, BTC’s Volatility Index has also declined, confirming the low volatility in the leading coin’s market.
According to the CryptoQuant’s analyst, the index’s value has dropped to extremely low levels, “which have only been seen four times in the last six years.” 
BTC’s price swings are minimal
AMBCrypto’s assessment of the coin’s Bollinger Bands and Average True Range confirmed the analyst’s positions. 
Readings from BTC’s Bollinger Bands showed a narrowing gap between the indicator’s upper and lower bands. This happens during a period of reduced price swings.
BTC’s declining Average True Range (ATR) confirmed this trend. This indicator measures market volatility by calculating the average range between high and low prices over a specified number of periods. 

Read Bitcoin’s [BTC] Price Prediction 2024-2025

When the indicator falls, it suggests lower market volatility and hints that the asset’s price is trending within a range. At 2138.35 at press time, BTC’s ATR has declined by 44% since 19 April. 
Source: BTC/USDT on TradingView
According to AxelAdlerJr, the current low volatility in the BTC market is a good sign. “
“Given that the market’s current structure remains bullish and that the end of the low volatility period could be followed by a strong price movement, it can be concluded that the market is in the process of forming a new bullish trend,” the analyst added.

May's Crypto Market: Centralized Exchange Declining Volumes Hint at Bigger Changes Ahead


								The trading volume across centralized cryptocurrency exchanges has notably declined, dropping to $5.27 trillion in May 2024. This decrease, roughly 20.1% from the previous month, marks a continued downtrend following the muted price activity of Bitcoin after its April Halving.
Crypto Exchange Landscape And Institutional Interest
According to CCData reports, this deceleration affects both spot and derivatives markets. Spot trading diminished by 21.6% to reach $1.57 trillion. The decline was slightly less steep at 19.4% on the derivatives front, totaling $3.69 trillion.
Centralized crypto exchange metric. | Source: CCData
Despite the overall drop, derivatives trading claimed an increased market share, a shift attributed to the US Security and Exchange Commission (SEC)’s unexpected endorsement of spot Ethereum exchange-traded funds (ETFs). This endorsement sparked a 50.3% boost in Ethereum derivative instruments’ open interest to $14.0 billion.

Regarding market presence, Bybit surged to a record high in spot market share at 7.36%, even as its trading volume contracted by 12.7%. Binance, maintaining its lead, captured a 34.6% share of the spot market.

In the derivatives sector, Binance also increased its dominance to 45.4%, with competitors OKX and Bitget holding substantial portions as well.
Meanwhile, the US CME exchange displayed mixed results; while its overall derivatives volume receded, ETH futures and options soared, achieving record highs of $20.5 billion and $931 million, respectively. This upswing suggests a growing institutional fascination, particularly following regulatory advancements.
The trading scene in May also reflected a reactive adjustment to regulatory developments, notably the SEC’s approval of spot Ethereum ETFs—a decision that momentarily increased trading activities.
Bitcoinist, citing the CryptoQuant report, has recently reported that such regulatory nods often lead to speculative trading, evident from significant outflows from major exchanges like Coinbase and Kraken.
Continuous Outflows From Exchanges Signal Bullish Sentiment
Recent reports reveal that on-chain data has detected significant Bitcoin outflows from Coinbase, suggesting possible large-scale acquisitions. According to a CryptoQuant Quicktake analysis, Coinbase has experienced substantial outflows for the seventh time this year.
The ‘exchange outflow’ metric, which measures the volume of Bitcoin withdrawn from exchange wallets, indicates investors removing their assets for long-term holding, hinting at a strong bullish sentiment.

These movements are not isolated to Coinbase; Kraken has also seen significant outflows, recording the highest movement of Bitcoin and Ethereum since 2017.

This pattern underscores a broader market behavior where large holders transition from short-term trading to permanently securing their assets. Such strategic withdrawals often signal a positive outlook for future price appreciation, reflecting investor confidence in the enduring value of cryptocurrencies.

FOMO Frenzy Versus Community Focus - Why Celebrity Meme Coins Need More Than Star Power - The Daily Hodl


								
 
The dynamic cryptocurrency market continuously churns out new trends (organic and not-so-organic), with the recent surge of celebrity-backed meme coins being a prime example.
Most avid users of digital wallets witnessed the initial excitement surrounding these tokens, like JENNER, RICH and BANDO.
Fueled by the meme coin craze and celebrity endorsements, these tokens experienced a surge in trading activity. However, the dream quickly turned sour.
Within a mere two to three days of launch, the market value of these tokens plummeted dramatically, with some experiencing dips close to 90%.
JENNER by Caitlyn Jenner, for instance, launched with a market cap that briefly touched $43.3 million but now sits at a meager $5.6 million, marking an approximate 87% decline.
Similar stories unfolded for RICH from Rich the Kid (originally valued at $5.3 million, now at $237 thousand) and other celebrity-backed coins like the mentioned BANDO from Trippie Redd, or DAVIDO (Davido), and MOTHER from Iggy Azalea.
Speaking about the dramatic price drops – the threadbare inherent volatility of the crypto market is now heavily influenced by news-driven sentiment and speculation.
Early investor exits to secure profits can trigger rapid sell-offs, especially when a coin lacks liquidity, which is common for meme coins.
Building beyond the buzz
While the recent crash highlights the risks associated with meme coins, I believe there’s potential for successful projects.
Meme coins thrive on community consensus, much like dedicated fan bases.
Celebrities wield considerable influence, and their involvement could be leveraged to launch projects with high potential.
A successful celebrity-backed meme coin could pave the way for wider crypto adoption, similar to the ‘NFT summer’ phenomenon, where celebrities sparked mainstream interest in digital assets.
However, a critical distinction exists between hype and substance. Can celebrity involvement alone translate to long-term success?
The answer lies in a combination of factors. Successful meme coins will need more than just a celebrity name attached.
Clear utility, a strong development team with a proven track record and a dedicated community are crucial for sustained growth.
A bit more on this below.
Utility
What problem does a meme coin solve? Does it offer unique features or functionality within DAO or the metaverse?
Dogecoin, for example, is considered a meme coin, but it has also established itself as a viable medium of exchange for some online transactions – on social media, for instance.
For a meme coin to achieve long-term success, it needs a clear purpose that goes beyond simply being associated with a celebrity.
Development team
Who is building the project? A strong development team with experience in blockchain technology is essential.
Look for teams with a history of successful projects and a clear roadmap outlining the coin’s development goals.
Community
A strong, engaged community is essential for any cryptocurrency project.
Look for projects with active social media channels, forums and discussions where the community is actively involved in the project’s future.
A passionate and engaged community can help promote the coin and provide valuable feedback for development.
Fleeting celebrity endorsements shouldn’t sway investors. Researching the project’s fundamentals – tokenomics (distribution and use of tokens), roadmap and development team – is crucial before investing in any meme coin or any cryptocurrency for that matter.
The future of celebrity meme coins
The recent crash serves as a cautionary tale for investors considering meme coins based solely on celebrity hype.
However, the potential for successful meme coins with real-world utility and strong communities shouldn’t be entirely discounted.
As the crypto market matures, we may see more celebrity-backed meme coins that offer genuine value propositions and contribute to wider crypto adoption.
If we focus on fundamentals, foster strong communities and prioritize long-term utility over short-term hype, the future of celebrity meme coins and meme coins in general can be brighter.

Whale Accumulation Drives Shiba Inu, Cardano, JasmyCoin Upwards: Do They Know Something We Don't? - Benzinga

Whale investors, known to move cryptocurrency markets with their moves, are showing significant interest in coins like Shiba Inu, Cardano, and the latest sensation, JasmyCoin.What Happened: Large transactions, worth at least $100,000, for each of these cryptocurrencies have more than doubled this week compared to the 2024 averages, according to on-chain analytics firm Santiment.Following this, the aforementioned coins witnessed a notable surge in price, as indicated below.CryptocurrencyGains this week +/-Price (Recorded at 10:35 p.m. EDT)JasmyCoin (CRYPTO: Jasmy)+12%$0.03899Shiba Inu SHIB/USD+9%$0.00002588Cardano DOGE/USD+3.8%$0.4612The surge in whale activity, followed by a rise in price, led Santiment to infer that wealthy investors were accumulating—a bullish signal for any cryptocurrency.Among the three, SHIB was the most-traded coin in the last 24 hours, with volumes rising 31% to $929 million.Why It Matters: Whales possess a large stash of cryptocurrencies and typically include institutional investors, including big banks, hedge funds, and high-income individuals.Their growing interest in the coins mentioned above indicates confidence in their near-term prospects, spurred partly by the recent rally in blue-chip currencies like Bitcoin BTC/USD and Ethereum ETH/USD.More than 65% of SHIB holders are currently in profit, while nearly 80% of JASMY holders are "in the money," according to data from IntoTheBlock. As for ADA, majority of holders are still in losses as of this writing.Photo by Igor Faun on ShutterstockRead Next: Riot Platforms Stirs Up Bitcoin Mining Market, Increases Stake in Rival Bitfarms to 12%

Ethereum vs Solana: Which blockchain will dominate in 2024? - AMBCrypto



Solana outperformed Ethereum in active addresses and trading volume.
Despite Solana’s growth, Ethereum’s network activity and security position it as superior.

Mirroring the broader market trend, both Ethereum [ETH] and Solana [SOL] exhibited positive trading activity, with ETH experiencing a 1.4% increase and SOL showing a 4.64% hike in the past 24 hours.  
However, delving deeper into their performance revealed an interesting insight: Solana has surpassed Ethereum in activity metrics, boasting a higher number of active addresses and trading volume. 
Solana’s active addresses surged above 1 million, while Ethereum’s remained stagnant, highlighting a notable disparity between the two networks.
Further confirming this sentiment, AMBCrypto’s analysis of Santiment data revealed that SOL outperformed ETH in social dominance as well.
Source: Santiment
With such key metrics hinting at Solana’s potential to overtake Ethereum, a fundamental question emerges: Which blockchain will emerge victorious in 2024 and beyond? 
Ethereum vs Solana: The debate
Sharing their insights, Ethereum Researcher Justin Drake and Solana Co-Founder Anatoly Yakovenko engaged in a debate on Ethereum versus Solana on the ‘Bankless’ podcast. 
Shedding light on what’s good about Solana, Drake noted, 
“I think what Solana is doing for Ethereum is that it is providing healthy competition. It’s a sort of accelerationism and not only because of good execution but also because of contrarianism.” 
In response, Yakovenko, while praising ETH’s decision to prioritize security over scalability, he said, 
“People think Ethereum is moving slowly but if you look at the size of the network, its value…I would be terrified of any changes to Solana if it was at that value.”
He further went ahead and added, 
“Ethereum is at a point which I think every other L1 should be envious of, and try to get there as fast as they can. All of that I think puts it in a class in my mind actually above Bitcoin.”  
This highlights that Ethereum is still the winner in the L1 space owing to the most network effects, liquidity, maturity, and security, making it pre-ordained to surpass Bitcoin and become number one. 
However, on the other hand, Drake justified that Solana could become the ‘internet of value’, justifying its $100 billion valuation. 
He further added that SOL’s developers are more focused on building user-targeting products rather than infrastructure, which contributes to its success.
SOL a competitor to ETH?
Adding to the fray, Raoul Pal, CEO of Real Vision and Global Macro Investor, drawing parallels with ETH’s 2020 bull run highlighted Solana’s emergence as a strong Ethereum competitor. 
He best put it when he said, 
“If you go back to 2020, Ethereum started basing and then began outperforming from about the summer onwards. It really started picking up towards the end of 2020, and then by 2021, it went ballistic, you know, it went into full banana mode. I think we’ll see something similar.”

Bitcoin Whales Keep Buying, Now Control Over 40% Of Supply


								On-chain data shows the Bitcoin whales now own over 40% of the entire BTC supply, as they have continued to accumulate more recently.
Bitcoin Whales Have Been In Buying Mode Since Mid-March
According to data from the market intelligence platform IntoTheBlock, the BTC whales have been increasing their supply since the middle of March. The “whales” here refer to the Bitcoin addresses carrying more than 1,000 BTC in their balance.

At the current exchange rate of the cryptocurrency, this amount converts to around $71.4 million, which is quite quite massive. Because of these large holdings, the whales are considered influential entities on the network.
As such, their collective behavior can be something to watch, given that their movements may affect the cryptocurrency’s price. There are many ways to track this behavior, one of which is through the trend in their total supply.
Below is the chart shared by IntoTheBlock, which reveals the trajectory of the collective balance of these large holders over the past few months.

The value of the metric seems to have been going up over the last few months | Source: IntoTheBlock on X
As the above graph shows, the balance of the Bitcoin whales has been constantly increasing during the past few months. This rise started as the consolidation following the price’s all-time high (ATH) began.
It would appear that while the rest of the market was panicking about the struggle BTC’s price was facing, these colossal entities were seeing it as an opportunity to accumulate more of the asset.
Following the latest buying spree, the holdings owned by these large investors have risen to a figure equivalent to more than 40% of the cryptocurrency’s entire supply in circulation.
If the whales keep up buying, they may soon cross the 50% supply mark. While buying from these holders is a positive sign for the coin’s price, the fact that these holders aren’t far from controlling most of the supply may not be optimal.
In some other news, as CryptoQuant Netherlands community manager Maartunn has shared in an X post, the total Open Interest across the cryptocurrency sector currently stands at $51.01 billion, which is quite close to the ATH.

The trend in the aggregated global Open Interest in the digital asset sector | Source: @JA_Maartun on X
The Open Interest here measures the total amount of derivatives positions (in USD) related to cryptocurrencies currently open on all exchanges. Generally, the total leverage in the market goes up when the metric increases, so the market could become more unstable.

As Open Interest in the digital asset sector approaches its ATH, it’s possible that some sharp volatility could soon be coming for coins across the market.
BTC Price
At the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading at around $71,400, up 6% over the past week.

BTC Price Came 3% Away From Charting New ATH as Bitcoin ETF Inflow Streak Equals Record


																After a relatively quiet and sluggish weekend, bitcoin’s price started moving north once again at the start of the business week and kept rising until it popped to $71,767 (on Bitstamp) yesterday evening.
This came amid the growing inflows toward most US-based spot Bitcoin ETFs, as yesterday saw nearly $500 million being poured in. Even Grayscale’s GBTC saw positive flows.
What’s even more impressive about the amount of USD going into the largest US spot BTC ETFs is the streak they have been on.
The last time there were outflows from these financial vehicles was nearly a month ago – on May 10. Since then, there have been very few occasional outflows from certain ETFs, like $100 million being taken out of Ark Invest’s ARKB on May 30, but the overall numbers have not been in the red.
Thus, the positive streak of consecutive inflow days has risen to 16, which equals the previous record set in February. As reported recently, June 4 saw the second-biggest day of inflows ($886.6 million), while the number for yesterday was $488.1 million.




Fidelity’s FBTC was once again in the lead, raking in more than $220 million. BlackRock’s IBIT followed suit with $155.4 million, and even Grayscale’s GBTC, which has seen the most substantial outflows ever since its conversion, gathered $14.6 million.
These positive numbers were perhaps the main source fueling another price rally for the underlying asset. BTC had dipped to around $69,000 on June 4 but started gaining traction once again yesterday and soared to a 15-day peak of $71,767 (Bitstamp).
As such, bitcoin came less than 3% away from its all-time high set on March 14 ($73,737). Despite losing around a grand since then, the crypto community believes charting a fresh peak is a matter of when and not if.

Here's Why XRP ETF is 'Inevitable:' Ripple CEO Chips in


																TL;DR

The approval of spot BTC and ETH ETFs has led to speculation about the potential launch of a spot XRP ETF in the US, with Ripple’s CEO Brad Garlinghouse suggesting it’s “inevitable.”
However, the ongoing legal battle between the company and the SEC over allegations of unregistered securities offerings might complicate the green light of such a financial product.


Is XRP ETF Coming Next?
The cryptocurrency market has been booming since the beginning of 2024, with bitcoin (BTC) hitting a new all-time high of over $73,700 in mid-March and currently trading well above the $70K mark. This success could be partially attributed to the historical launch of certain financial products unavailable in the US several months ago. 
The products in question are spot BTC ETFs, which received the SEC’s green light in January. Last month, the agency gave the thumbs up for spot ETH ETFs, too.
Those financial vehicles provide investors with exposure to digital assets without having to purchase them directly from exchanges. They simplify the investment process and mitigate some risks associated with handling cryptocurrencies (such as self-custody, for example).




In the past few months, many industry participants have speculated that a spot XRP ETF can also see the light of day in America. Not long ago, Ripple’s CEO – Brad Garlinghouse – claimed that such a product, alongside SOL ETFs and ADA ETFs, is “inevitable.”
Most recently, he doubled down on his stance, suggesting that investors want exposure to numerous ETFs, not only those with Bitcoin and Ethereum as underlying assets:
“To me, it only makes sense. You don’t want to have just a single-threaded asset exposure. I think people also forget that it wasn’t that long time ago (before the SEC got involved) that XRP was the second-most valuable digital asset.”
Garlinghouse’s first comments on the potential launch of a spot XRP ETF in the US came in February this year. Back then, he said his company would welcome such a product. A few months later, the CEO outlined the firm’s roadmap for the next three years. Interestingly, the launch of a spot XRP ETF was not among the top priorities.
The Difficulties With the SEC
It is worth noting that the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) is the agency approving or rejecting such financial products in the United States. Those who have been following the crypto industry in the past few years must be aware that the regulator and Ripple are involved in a legal battle that recently entered its trial phase.
It all started in December 2020 when the SEC accused the firm and some of its executives of illegally raising more than $1.3 billion in an unregistered securities offering by selling XRP. Ripple secured three partial court victories last year, and according to some, it has the upper hand for a decisive victory.
XRP’s price spiked substantially after each triumph, meaning the eventual resolution of the case might trigger enhanced volatility once again. Those curious to learn about the lawsuit’s specifics and its impact on the asset’s valuation, feel free to check our dedicated video below:

Ethereum ETF Approval Timeline Uncertain, SEC Chair Warns


								The saga of Ethereum ETFs in the US continues with a new twist: cautious optimism. After the US Securities and Exchange Commission’s unexpected green light for spot Ethereum ETFs in May, investors have been eagerly awaiting the launch date. But according to SEC Chair Gary Gensler, patience remains key.

Gensler Throws Cold Water On Rapid Launch Hopes
In a recent interview with CNBC, Gensler tempered expectations, stating that final approvals for individual ETFs “will likely take some time.”
This suggests that the review process will likely take a long time, which could postpone the establishment of Ethereum ETFs, according to Eleanor Terrett, a writer for Fox Business.  However, Gensler did offer a glimmer of hope, acknowledging that the process is underway.


This wait-and-see approach comes amidst ongoing communication between the SEC and ETF issuers. Several companies have tweaked their applications based on the SEC’s feedback, including removing staking options and disclosing custodian details. These amendments suggest a collaborative effort, potentially expediting the approval process.

Total crypto market cap at $2.5 trillion on the daily chart: TradingView.com
Expert Opinions Divided On Timeline
Market experts are divided on the exact timeline for these ETF launches. Eric Balchunas, a Senior ETF Analyst at Bloomberg, remains optimistic. He believes issuers could receive the SEC’s nod by the end of June, with a possible launch date as early as July 4th. James Seyffart, another Bloomberg analyst, is more cautious, avoiding specific dates but suggesting approvals are likely within weeks, not months.


Ethereum ETF: Long-Term Success Uncertain
While the prospect of Ethereum ETFs is exciting for some, experts caution against unrealistic expectations. Unlike Bitcoin, which saw a surge in inflows with its ETF launch, Ethereum’s future might be less meteoric. The market’s overall volatility and the lack of clarity around staking within these ETFs could dampen investor enthusiasm.

A Calculated Move, Not A Gold Rush
The approval process for Ethereum ETFs highlights the SEC’s measured approach towards crypto regulation. While the agency seems receptive to innovation, it prioritizes investor protection. This cautious stance might delay the launch, but it could also ensure a more stable and secure entry point for mainstream investors into the Ethereum market.
For now, investors should buckle up for a potentially bumpy ride. While the launch of Ethereum ETFs appears to be on the horizon, it’s likely to be a gradual rollout rather than a sudden explosion. This measured approach, while frustrating for some, could ultimately pave the way for a more sustainable future for Ethereum and cryptocurrency as a whole.

'Rich Dad Poor Dad' Author Robert Kiyosaki Comes Up With Another Bold Projection: 'Bitcoin Will Be $350,000 By August 25' - Benzinga

Renowned investor and author Robert Kiyosaki grabbed the attention of cryptocurrency enthusiasts with his staggering $350,000 price prediction for Bitcoin BTC/USD in less than three months.What Happened: Kiyosaki took to social media platform X on Wednesday to make the bold projection about the King Crypto hitting the mark by August 2024."It's a prediction. It's speculation, it's an opinion, but it's not a lie," the author of “Rich Dad Poor Dad" wrote. "I am confident Bitcoin will hit $350,000 sometime in 2024 but for it's only a target, a dream, and a wish."Kiyosaki also said that he is grabbing more Bitcoin, Ethereum ETH/USD, and Solana SOL/USD for he is confident that their prices will continue to soar.The author of the best-selling personal finance book also used the opportunity to ridicule President Joe Biden and SEC Chair Gary Gensler, saying, "What I am confident of is the incompetence of our leaders, President Biden, Treasury Secretary Yellin, and Fed Chair Powell. Protect your self from the 3- Stooges."Why It Matters: Kiyosaki, a staunch supporter of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, has been known to make outlandish price predictions.Earlier this year, he posted on X that Bitcoin would hit $100,000 by June 2024. Going by the asset's ongoing trajectory, it seems highly unlikely now.The latest prediction of $350,000 by August 2024 will mean a nearly 5X jump from Bitcoin's price at the time of writing. Considering that the asset has grown by just 70% year-to-date despite bullish catalysts like spot ETFs, the forecast can be safely deemed unrealistic. That said, on a practical note, Bitcoin, along with Ethereum ETH/USD were poised to grow steadily, driven by demand from permanent holders and whales, according to Julio Moreno, Head of Research at CryptoQuant.Price Action: At the time of writing, BTC was trading at $71,099.25, trading mostly flat in the last 24 hours, according to data from Benzinga Pro.Image created using photos on Flickr and ShutterstockRead Next: Ethereum Could Soar To $22K By 2030, Predicts VanEck — Investment Giant Says Spot ETFs ‘Nearing Approval To Trade’

Experts Debate Real-World Assets Tokenization at Hearing


On Wednesday, the US Financial Services House Committee held a hearing titled “Next Generation Infrastructure: How Tokenization of Real-World Assets Will Facilitate Efficient Markets.”
The hearing aimed to assess the need for more regulations to support the tokenization of real-world assets (RWA) and derivative products.
Diverse Opinions Emerge on Blockchain Use in Traditional Finance

Notable individuals from a range of professions participated during the hearing. Carlos Domingo, the Co-founder and CEO of Securitize, and Robert Morgan, the CEO of the USDF Consortium, represented the real-world assets tokenization industry.
From the financial markets, Lilya Tessler, a Partner at Sidley Austin LLP, and Nadine Chakar, the Global Head of Digital Assets at the Depository Trust and Clearing Corporation, also contributed. Additionally, the hearing featured an academic perspective from Prof. Hilary Allen, a Law Professor at American University Washington College of Law.
During the session, witnesses and lawmakers shared varied perspectives on tokenization. Chairman French Hill highlighted tokenization’s potential to bring traditional finance onto the blockchain, promising enhanced efficiency and reduced costs.

“Tokenization can leverage the efficiency and transparency of blockchains to help modernize US markets. […] With the help of blockchain, tokenization can automate some of these critical processes within financial transactions, bringing along streamlined settlement and lower costs,” he said.

Tessler emphasized the widespread digital representation of assets, noting that blockchain could enhance these processes by offering programmability and liquidity. Morgan discussed the evolution of ledger technologies in banking. He suggested that distributed ledger technology (DLT) could break down silos in the financial system.

“Today, financial infrastructure consists of a series of siloed systems. Tokenization has a unique ability to break down these silos, facilitating real-time collaboration among financial institutions,” Morgan explained.

Chakar echoed the sentiment. She stressed the importance of building interoperable infrastructures with built-in compliance. Additionally, Domingo showcased Securitize’s role in modernizing private capital markets through tokenization, underlining the technology’s efficiency.
Ongoing Debate: Can Tokenization Transform Traditional Finance?
However, not all experts and lawmakers were optimistic about real-world assets tokenization. Congressman Brad Sherman and Professor Hilary Allen voiced concerns over the implications of tokenization. Particularly, they are worried about regulatory oversight and financial stability.

Sherman questioned the potential for tokenization to bypass existing regulatory frameworks. Meanwhile, Allen criticized public blockchains’ inefficiencies and operational fragilities.

“Public permissionless blockchains suffer from inescapable inefficiencies and operational fragilities, making them unsuitable for real-world financial assets. […] Tokenization should not be used to integrate real-world financial services with the crypto universe,” Allen opined.

Despite the differing opinions, the hearing shows the ongoing debate about the future of blockchain technology in traditional finance. Indeed, the potential regulatory clarity from such discussions could pave the way for broader adoption of tokenization. Particularly in high-potential industries like real estate and securities.
As the debate continues, it’s clear that the finance industry is on the brink of a transformation. Industry leaders are exploring the innovative applications of real-world asset tokenization.

Notably, some banking giants like Citi are exploring tokenization’s potential. In a report, Tony McLaughlin, one of Citi’s executives, explained that tokenization could revolutionize digital money by surpassing traditional account-based systems and creating networks of regulated liabilities. This innovation promises a new generation of digital money that is regulated, redeemable at par value, and legally owned by the holder.

SEC chair Gensler cautions crypto exchanges on enforcement


U.S Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) Chairman Gary Gensler issued a warning to cryptocurrency exchanges, stating that providing disclosures to investors does not shield them from regulatory enforcement. 



Gensler emphasized in a CNBC interview Wednesday that disclosures alone are inadequate if crypto exchanges engage in activities such as market manipulation or disseminate misleading information that affects investment decisions. 



He also pointed out that many crypto companies fail to provide any disclosures, operating in a manner that would be unacceptable in conventional financial markets.



The SEC has ramped up its enforcement actions in the digital assets space, particularly after the collapse of cryptocurrency exchange FTX in late 2022. 



The agency is actively involved in litigation against some of the largest players in the U.S. crypto market, including a case against Coinbase, the largest exchange by daily trading volume in the United States.



Gensler showed a more nuanced approach when discussing the potential for crypto ETFs, such as those involving the Solana memecoin BONK. 



This softer tone aligns with the SEC’s recent approval of spot Ethereum ETFs, a decision that was unexpected by many due to previous considerations of Ethereum as an unregistered security.



The SEC’s approval of Ethereum ETFs has sparked discussions about the agency’s willingness to consider other altcoin spot ETFs. 



Political dynamics, including the influence of the crypto lobby and the approaching 2024 election, are thought to have influenced the SEC’s evolving stance.

Top Analyst Says Blue-Chip Altcoin Primed To Spark 70% Rally, Updates Outlook on Ethereum - The Daily Hodl


								A widely followed cryptocurrency analyst and trader believes that a top-10 altcoin by market cap is destined to rally by double-digit percentage points from the current level.
The analyst pseudonymously known as Bluntz tells his 260,900 followers on the social media platform X that BNB, the utility token for the BNB Chain ecosystem, is set to reach a price of at least $1,000.










“There’s no way BNB doesn’t get a four-digit handle this cycle.”
Based on Bluntz’s chart of BNB on the weekly timeframe, it appears that the pseudonymous analyst who sometimes employs the Elliott Wave theory in his technical analysis expects BNB to reach a price of around $1,200 in a five-wave pattern – a gain of about 71% from the current level.
The Elliott Wave theory states that the main trend of the price of an asset moves in a five-wave pattern while a correction occurs in a three-wave pattern.
Source: Bluntz/X
BNB is trading at $700 at time of writing, around 1% below the all-time high of $710 reached on June 5th.
Next up is the Ethereum/Bitcoin (ETH/BTC) pair. The pseudonymous analyst says that the downward movement that followed a bearish divergence that had formed on the 12-hour timeframe chart of ETH/BTC appears to have ended.
A bearish divergence is a technical analysis pattern characterized by the price of an asset going up while an indicator, the Relative Strength Index (RSI) indicator, in this case, is trending downwards.
“Big move soon and I’m leaning towards up, at the moment.”

Ethereum (ETH) is trading at 0.05358 BTC ($3,802) at time of writing.

Cardano Founder Discusses ADA's Future And Exciting Updates


								In a forceful rebuttal to widespread media speculation about the viability of Cardano, founder Charles Hoskinson has provided a detailed rundown of forthcoming developments and initiatives which he believes underscore the cryptocurrency’s robust health and its promising future.
Cardano Founder Slams Crypto Media
In a statement via X, Hoskinson expressed his frustration with the current narrative surrounding ADA in the crypto media landscape. “Never in my career have I seen such a profound disconnect between reality and opinion with the cryptocurrency influencer and media perception of Cardano versus its actual fundamentals,” he stated.
He emphasized that Cardano is on the brink of significant developments, including what he describes as the “most significant hard fork in the history of the project.” The forthcoming Chang Hard Fork represents a pivotal evolution for Cardano, transitioning control of the protocol fully to the community.

This move will burn all seven genesis keys, thereby marking a historic leap toward complete decentralization. The upgrade, anticipated to significantly advance on-chain governance as outlined in CIP-1694, will also see the introduction of delegated representatives (DReps), further decentralizing decision-making processes within the ecosystem.
Beyond the hard fork, Hoskinson highlighted several other initiatives poised to catalyze growth and innovation within the ecosystem. These include the introduction of new technologies such as Hydra, a layer-two scalability solution designed to enhance transaction speeds and reduce costs, which is currently in the maturation phase. Moreover, Hoskinson highlighted that Cardano can boast several partner chains with Midnight and Prism.
Cardano’s active community participation is evident in the rapidly growing number of DApps, significant research and development in blockchain scalability, and the organization of major events such as the Rare Evo blockchain convention (August 15-17), the Cardano Foundation Summit in Dubai (October 23-24), and participation in TOKEN2049 in Singapore (September 18-19).

Moreover, the Project Catalyst initiative continues to be a driving force for community-led innovation, providing funding and support to projects that promise real-world applications and solutions. Looking forward, the Cardano ecosystem is also preparing for a significant constitutional convention in Buenos Aires, where delegates will ratify a final version of Cardano’s Constitution, further establishing the framework for decentralized governance.
“We are on the verge of the most significant hard fork in the history of the project, tons of community DApps are growing rapidly, we are leading the industry in scaling R&D, rare evo is going to be a huge event, the Foundation summit huge, we’ll be at Token 2049, technologies like Hydra are maturing, we have partnerchains, Midnight, Prism, tons of community events, catalyst, and then the constitutional convention in Argentina,” Hoskinson stated.
The ADA founder concluded with a strong message to detractors, asserting, “Cardano is here to stay, and it’s a juggernaut that will drag this industry kicking and screaming if it has to towards solving the real-world economic, political, and social issues we all is beyond pathetic and just reflects on the low quality and low effort they put into our ecosystem.” This statement not only refutes claims about Cardano’s demise but also challenges the cryptocurrency community to recognize and engage with the substantive advances being made.
At press time, ADA traded at $0.459.

Bitcoin miners pivot to AI: New revenue stream post-halving? - AMBCrypto



Bitcoin miners are embracing AI as alternative revenues amidst a decline in mining income. 
Possible miner capitulations flash a BTC buy signal as spikes in Hash Ribbons persist. 

More Bitcoin [BTC] miners, like Core Scientific, are massively diversifying into AI (artificial intelligence) to boost the revenue streams after April’s halving event. 
April’s BTC halving event reduced miners’ block rewards from 6.25 BTC to 3.125 BTC, slashing their revenue by half.  
As of 5th June, Bitcoin Miner Revenue per day stood at $30.05 million. This was down over 70% from the record high of $107 million hit on April’s 2024 halving day, per YCharts. 
Source: YCharts
AI to solve Bitcoin miners’ revenue problems?
However, according to a recent CNBC report, miners are now shifting their focus to AI computing for its higher rewards and increasing demand following the successful ChatGPT AI model from OpenAI. 
Per the report, Bit Digital now gets 27% of its revenue from AI. Hut 8, another BTC miner, and Hive generated 6% and 4%, respectively, of their revenue from AI. 
According to Core Scientific CEO Adam Sullivan, the shift to AI will help create, 
‘Diversified business model and more predictable cash flows.’
The AI diversification could be a welcome relief given the reported miner capitulations. 
Are some Bitcoin miners exiting?
In mid-May, an AMBCrypto report found that Bitcoin’s network hashrate dropped significantly, alongside possible miner capitulations amidst spikes in Bitcoin Hash Ribbons. 
Hash Ribbons track short and long-term moving averages of Bitcoin’s hashrate. Spikes in the metric demonstrate low mining activity or exit of less efficient Bitcoin miners. 
The Hash Ribbons signal has persisted, and crypto hedge fund Capriole Investments referred to the latest flash as a ‘tempting Bitocin buy signal.’
‘Hash Ribbons is back. Perhaps the best long-term Bitcoin buy signal there is, Hash Ribbons is now tempting us with the current Miner Capitulation, which started two weeks ago.’
Additionally, the Bitcoin miner reserve hit its yearly low of 1.8 million BTC. The low level was last seen 14 years ago and suggested that miners were offloading their holdings, probably through OTC (over-the-counter) markets. 
Source: CryptoQuant
Perhaps another piece that corroborated the Hash Ribbons’ ‘buy signal’ was Willy Woo’s claim that institutional traders were ‘risk-on’ and have pivoted to buying. Should you copy professionals or wait for a range breakout to jump in?

Ethereum's Buterin denounces celebrity memecoins, urges purposeful innovation


Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin has voiced criticism against the rise of celebrity-endorsed memecoins, calling for a shift towards cryptocurrencies with substantive, long-term goals. 



Addressing the crypto community through tweets on Wednesday, Buterin said that a crypto project needs to “have some kind of public-good goal” rather than enriching celebrities.



He suggests that while financialization is commendable when aligned with noble causes, many celebrity-driven tokens appear to prioritize immediate financial returns over meaningful objectives. 



Buterin’s comments come amid a wave of memecoins promoted by celebrities, which he argues lack a clear purpose or vision for the future.



One of the most popular celebrity memecoins launched recently belongs to Iggy Azalea, an Australian rapper who recently launched the token “MOTHER.”



The token has a market capitalization of over US$135 million, as of 2:30 a.m. ET, according to DEXTools.



Azalea claims that her project will donate to curing koalas from chlamydia, a major disease threat to the population of the endangered animal.



Some alleged scammers have taken advantage of the celebrity memecoin boom to launch suspicious projects carrying a celebrity’s name.

Forget 'Sell in May': Investors Double Down on ETFs in Record Numbers


							

ETF investors pour in $58 billion into equity ETFs in May 2024, defying the “Sell in May” adage.



Fixed-income ETFs also surge, attracting $27 billion; their best month in over a year.



Year-to-date ETF inflows hit +$315 billion, signaling an appetite for ETFs.




ETF investors demonstrated confidence in May 2024 by injecting a record $58 billion into equity ETFs. This was a historic capital inflow, particularly in an election year, a period typically characterized by market volatility. This large inflow of funds shows robust investor confidence and a firm stand against the ‘Sell in May’ strategy.



The fixed-income ETFs also saw an inflow of $27 billion in May, the highest in over a year. These figures contributed to the total ETF flows for the year-to-date, which is currently at +$315 billion. The data reflects the growing tendency of ETFs being actively used by investors who look for diversified yet easily tradable instruments.







Investor confidence remains strong despite market volatility, fueled by a growing preference for actively managed ETFs and an expanding market with a wider array of choices. Moreover, with 138 new ETFs launched in the first quarter of 2024, the market is expanding rapidly, providing investors with an array of choices.



In addition, the operational benefits of ETFs over mutual funds, vis-à-vis through lower fees and improved tax efficiency, draw in more investors. Moreover, advancements in trading systems make it easier for investors to trade and manage their ETFs.



The substantial inflows in both equity and fixed-income ETFs demonstrate a balanced approach among investors to keep their portfolio as diversified as possible even when interest rates fluctuate. The ETF inflows of May 2024 signal a strong vote of confidence from the investors who are slanting toward ETFs as their preferred investment.

ETH to $22,000 by 2030: VanEck's Investment Insights | Cryptoglobe


                                
On 5 June 2024, VanEck released an updated analysis forecasting the future of Ethereum (ETH), predicting its price to reach $22,000 by 2030. The report, authored by Matthew Sigel, Patrick Bush, and Denis Zinoviev, delves into the potential growth of ETH and its optimal inclusion in both traditional and crypto-specific portfolios. This analysis comes at a time when the cryptocurrency market is maturing and increasingly gaining the attention of institutional investors.



ETH Price Target and Market Dynamics



VanEck’s projection of ETH reaching $22,000 by 2030 is based on the premise of Ethereum maintaining its dominance in the smart contract platform space. The report highlights that Ethereum’s value proposition is particularly compelling to entrepreneurs and large technology companies, suggesting that it will continue to capture significant market share from traditional financial markets and Big Tech. According to VanEck, Ethereum could generate $66 billion in free cash flow, supporting a market capitalization of $2.2 trillion.



The report also mentions the anticipated approval of spot ether ETFs on U.S. stock exchanges, which could provide a secure investment vehicle for institutional investors and financial advisors, enhancing liquidity and pricing advantages.



Optimal Portfolio Allocations



VanEck’s analysis explores the optimal allocation of Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) within traditional 60/40 portfolios and crypto-only portfolios. Key findings include:



Traditional 60/40 Portfolios:A modest allocation of up to 6% in cryptocurrencies (3% BTC and 3% ETH) significantly improves the portfolio’s Sharpe ratio with minimal impact on drawdowns.This balanced approach provides enhanced risk-adjusted returns without excessively increasing volatility.Crypto-Only Portfolios:An optimal allocation of 70% BTC and 30% ETH yields the best risk-adjusted returns.This combination leverages BTC’s stability and ETH’s growth potential to maximize returns.



The analysis also indicates that higher allocations of cryptocurrencies can further improve portfolio performance for investors with higher risk tolerance.



Ethereum’s Growth and Revenue Projections







            
            

            
            

            
            

        

VanEck claims that Ethereum’s economic activity and revenue generation are substantial, with the network attracting around 20 million monthly active users and facilitating significant transaction volumes. VanEck’s report projects Ethereum’s total addressable market (TAM) across several sectors, including finance, marketing, infrastructure, and artificial intelligence (AI), estimating a TAM of $15 trillion.



The report also mentions that Ethereum’s revenue, driven by transaction fees, Layer-2 settlements, blockspace ordering, and security services, is expected to grow significantly. VanEck’s model predicts that financial businesses will account for 71% of Ethereum’s revenues by 2030, with the remainder coming from other sectors like marketing, infrastructure, and AI.



Comparative Analysis and Risks



The report draws comparisons between Ethereum and major Web2 companies, noting that Ethereum generates more revenue than platforms like Etsy and Twitch, and has a larger user base than Instacart and Robinhood. 



However, VanEck also acknowledges the risks associated with investing in ETH, including regulatory uncertainties, interest rate fluctuations, market competition, and geopolitical factors. These risks could potentially impact Ethereum’s growth and valuation, highlighting the need for cautious and informed investment decisions.

R. Kiyosaki predicts Bitcoin to hit $350k by this date


    As he continues to warn about a financial crisis in the United States and the world, popular investor and author Robert Kiyosaki has predicted that one of his favorite assets to help protect oneself against this economic demise – Bitcoin (BTC) – could hit the price of $350,000 by late August 2024.



Specifically, the author of the best-selling personal finance book ‘Rich Dad Poor Dad’ expressed his confidence that the maiden cryptocurrency would reach the stellar price of $350,000 by August 25 this year, although acknowledging it is only a prediction, per his X post on June 6.



Furthermore, Kiyosaki pointed out that he continued to buy more Bitcoin but also Ethereum (ETH) and Solana (SOL) because he was “quite certain their prices will continue to rise” because of the “incompetence of our leaders, President Biden, Treasury Secretary Yellin, and Fed Chair Powell.”







Indeed, referring to US President Joe Biden, Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen and Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell as the “three stooges in real life,” the finance educator advised his followers to buy more gold, silver, Bitcoin, Solana, and Ethereum,” to protect themselves from them.











As a reminder, Kiyosaki has long recommended stocking up on the above assets to safeguard one’s wealth, alongside warnings about inflation, mounting debt, and potential market instability, as well as that traditional financial products like stocks and bonds were in an ‘everything bubble.’



In terms of Bitcoin’s future, he has also supported a bold prognosis by Cathie Wood, the founder and CEO of ARK Invest, which manages several exchange-traded funds (ETFs), who previously said that Bitcoin could hit a staggering price of $2.3 million per wholecoin.



At the moment, the flagship decentralized finance (DeFi) asset is trading above the critical psychological level at $70,000, after spending the majority of the past several weeks below it, and in continuation of a bullish year that has witnessed its advance of nearly 70% since the start of 2024.

Turkey Ranks 4th in Crypto Trading, Govt Wave Off Crypto...


                                Turkey Dismisses Plans to Tax Crypto, A Bold Move For Market Growth                                Turkey has chosen not to introduce taxation on stock and cryptocurrency trading profits and has only discussed the introduction of a small transaction tax as a part of its measures to control financial transactions. This development was released by the Minister of Finance and Finance Mehmet Şimşek.What's the news?Recently, Minister Şimşek stated that Turkey will not collect taxes on the profits earned from stocks or cryptocurrencies. However, what the government is contemplating is that there is likelihood of implementing a small tax on dealing in these assets. The details of this proposed transaction tax including the potential amount, have yet to be detailed.This announcement comes against the backdrop of earlier reports that indicated that Turkey was to entirely exempt stock and cryptocurrency trading from taxation. In the course of the meeting, Minister Şimşek pointed to the need to set proper taxation for all types of financial income in order to foster a fair taxation system.In a report from Chainalysis, it was found that Turkey is the fourth biggest country in cryptocurrency trading, outpacing Russia, Canada, Vietnam, Thailand, and Germany. The policy based on no tax on crypto also raises questions that the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) has recently issued and also seeks to enhance the position of Turkey in the international cryptocurrency market. Currently, Turkey trades an estimated $170 billion by 2023, and it plays a relatively large role in the crypto space.Why Turkey Wave off Taxes on Cryptocurrency Profits?The government of Turkey has withdrawn the decision to tax profits from cryptocurrencies and stocks because of a long-term plan to dominate the global financial markets.Thus, the tax rate on the profits from the stock market in Turkey was cut in half in 2008 from 10% to 0%. It was a daring initiative that opened the doors for investment and businesses in the country. The Turkish government acknowledges the fact that cryptocurrencies play a crucial part in the global economy.By not imposing taxes on cryptocurrency profits, Turkey aims to promote a favorable environment for digital asset trading, thereby attracting more participants to the financial market wellspring.Benefits of Not Levying Taxes on Cryptocurrencies presents several benefits for Turkey's Increased Investment even without the burden of profit taxes, both domestic and international investors are more likely to participate in Turkey's financial markets. Market Growth is also an aspect because the absence of such taxes can stimulate trading activity, leading to higher trading volumes and market liquidity. It could be Innovation Encouragement as by creating a crypto-friendly regulatory environment, Turkey can position itself as a hub for blockchain and cryptocurrency innovation.Alternative Options: Transaction TaxHowever, to ensure a fair and balanced taxation system, Turkey is considering the implementation of a "very limited" transaction tax. This alternative option would impose a modest levy on the movement of assets, rather than the gains realized from them. Minister Şimşek underscored the government's commitment to ensuring that no area remains untaxed, in pursuit of justice and effectiveness in taxation.The potential transaction tax would apply to the movement of assets rather than the gains realized from them. This could be a balanced solution, allowing the government to collect revenue while maintaining an attractive environment for investors.ConclusionTurkey is preparing itself for competition in the global financial market by removing taxes from profits earned from cryptocurrencies and stocks. The abolishment of the small transaction tax shows that the government has the best interest of all its citizens in its heart by coming up with fair and acceptable tax measures.Indeed, Turkey has remained steadfast on its path to providing the right environment for the regulated growth of this industry as seen by the new bill that requires companies dealing in cryptocurrencies to acquire a license and adhere to international standards.Also Read: Fake Plugin Drains Binance Account Of User, Loses $1 Million

Bitcoin at $71k: Can it climb higher amid a sell signal? - AMBCrypto



Bitcoin’s price surged by more than 4% in the last seven days. 
Indicators suggested that BTC might reach $87k soon.

Bitcoin [BTC] bulls worked hard this week as the king of cryptos’ price surpassed $70k. This sparked excitement in the community, and several expected the coin’s price to rise further. 
However, a sell signal flashed on BTC’s chart, which could have impacted its price. 
Bitcoin holds above $70k
CoinMarketCap’s data revealed that BTC gained bullish momentum on the 3rd of June as its value started to rise. The coin’s price spiked by more than 4% in the last seven days. 
At the time of writing, BTC was trading at $71,091.06 with a market capitalization of over $1.4 trillion.
 In the meantime, Ali, a popular crypto analyst, posted a tweet highlighting a sell signal. This hinted at a price decline. 
However, the signal didn’t have much impact on Bitcoin’s price action as the coin continued to trade above $71k.
 AMBCrypto’s analysis of CryptoQuant’s data revealed that investors didn’t sell BTC either. The coin’s exchange reserve was dropping, signaling high buying pressure.
 Additionally, buying sentiment remained dominant among US investors as BTC’s Coinbase premium was green.

Will BTC continue to rise?
AMBCrypto’s analysis of Glassnode’s data revealed that BTC might continue its bull rally. As per the coin’s Pi Cycle Top indicator, BTC was yet to reach its market top.
 This meant that BTC’s price might continue to rise to $87k before it witnesses any major price correction.
 For starters, the Pi Cycle indicator is composed of the 111-day moving average and a 2x multiple of the 350-day moving average of Bitcoin’s price. 
Source: Glassnode
BTC’s binary CDD was green, meaning that long-term holders’ movements in the last 7 days were lower than average. They have a motive to hold their coins. 
Additionally, its funding rate also increased. This meant that long-position traders are dominant and are willing to pay short-position traders. These metrics suggested that the chances of BTC continuing to rise were high. 
AMBCrypto then analyzed BTC’s daily chart to better understand which direction its price was headed. The technical indicator MACD displayed a bullish crossover.

On top of that, BTC’s Relative Strength Index (RSI) remained well above the neutral mark, suggesting a further price hike in the coming days. 
However, while the aforementioned indicators supported the bulls, BTC’s Chaikin Money Flow (CMF) favored the bears. This seemed to be the case, as the indicator registered a downtick in the recent past.

Is Bitcoin Manipulated? Experts Explain 'Small' ETF Inflow Impact


																The US spot Bitcoin Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs) have been witnessing a historic run of inflows, marking 17 consecutive days of net additions. On a particularly notable Tuesday, these ETFs observed inflows totaling a staggering $886.6 million, ranking it as the second-highest single-day influx since their introduction.
This was followed by another significant day of inflows yesterday, amounting to $488.1 million, with notable contributions from major financial players like Fidelity ($220.6 million), Blackrock ($155.1 million), and Ark ($71.4 million). Despite these hefty capital injections, the price of Bitcoin has demonstrated a relatively subdued response, inching from $68,000 to $71,000 since the beginning of the week.
The muted price movement in the face of substantial ETF inflows has puzzled many market participants and analysts. Typically, such inflows are expected to exert a stronger upward pressure on Bitcoin prices. However, the observed price dynamics suggest that other counteracting factors might be at play.
Why Is The Bitcoin Price Not Going Higher?
Crypto trading analytics platform The Kingfisher offered an explanation via a post on X, suggesting that a carry trade strategy might be influencing the price dynamics. According to their analysis, “The BTC ETF inflows didn’t affect the price as much as you hoped it would? It might be due to a carry trade being loaded up. Short Futures + Buy Spot/ETF.”

	Related Reading


A carry trade in this context involves shorting Bitcoin futures while simultaneously buying spot Bitcoin or Bitcoin ETF shares. This strategy can hedge against potential price volatility and exploit discrepancies between futures prices and spot prices.
JJ the Janitor (@JLabsJanitor) further elaborated on the strategy’s mechanics. He drew parallels with behaviors visualized on the PANDA Terminal charts, explaining, “When big boys want BTC spot filled they sell futures contracts to bring price into bids. When they’re filled + ready to let it rip they close those shorts, hence the inverse correlation on True Open Interest (OI).”
His remarks hint at strategic market manipulations that, while legal, blur the lines between savvy investment tactics and potential ethical concerns. His follow-up tweet, “Market manipulation or savvy investment strategy….what’s the difference?” challenges the narrative by questioning the ethical implications of such strategies.

The discussion prompted further scrutiny from the crypto community. X user Sahra critiqued the practical implementation of the carry trade, noting, “Carry trade should suppress funding rates naturally. Long spot pressure against the perpetual should in theory cause perpetual rates to drop (all else being equal) as perpetual would begin to lag spot. Everything else makes sense, but these rates are far too low to justify a carry IMO.”
This comment points to the complexities of carry trades, where expected outcomes like suppressed funding rates are not aligning with market observations, suggesting that other forces might be influencing the market.
The Kingfisher responded to Sahra’s skepticism, acknowledging the anomaly: “That’s right, the funding remains fairly positive though. This suggests that while a carry trade could be in play, it’s not the dominant force in the market. Other factors, like bullish sentiment or other buying pressures, might be offsetting the expected downward pressure on funding rates from the carry trade.”
At press time, BTC traded at $70,803.

SEC 'exceeded' authority on fee disclosures, US appeals court rules - Crypto Briefing


            
            
                            
            
                            
            
            In a blow to the SEC’s claimed authority over the hedge fund sector, a United States appeals court has struck down a rule that required hedge funds and private equity firms to increase transparency regarding their fees and expenses.The Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals issued a unanimous decision on June 5, with a three-judge panel ruling that the SEC exceeded its statutory authority in implementing the measure.The court’s ruling came in response to a challenge brought by six industry groups, who argued that the SEC’s 656-page rule would significantly alter the sector’s operations and increase compliance costs. The rule mandated quarterly performance and fee reports, annual audits, and the elimination of preferential treatment for certain investors.Writing on behalf of the panel, Judge Kurt Engelhardt rejected the SEC’s assertion that the Dodd-Frank Act, passed in the wake of the 2008 financial crisis to reform the financial sector, had expanded its authority to oversee private funds. Engelhardt emphasized that the two sections of the Act cited by the SEC did not grant the Commission such authority, stating:
“The promulgation of the Final Rule was unauthorized, no part of it can stand.”
The court’s decision has resonated with critics of the SEC within the crypto industry, who have raised similar concerns about the regulator’s claimed authority in recent years. In a series of lawsuits against crypto firms, the SEC has argued that many cryptocurrencies qualify as securities under its jurisdiction, relying on the Howey test as a legal framework. However, crypto firms have pushed back, asserting that the SEC lacks the authority to regulate crypto without explicit congressional approval.The SEC now faces potential action from Congress that could alter its claimed authority over the US crypto industry. The Financial Innovation and Technology for the 21st Century Act (FIT21), which would primarily transfer authority over the crypto industry to the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, recently passed the House with strong bipartisan support.Additionally, the SEC narrowly avoided a Congressional resolution aimed at repealing its Staff Accounting Bulletin (SAB) 121, which prevented banks from owning crypto, thanks to a veto by President Joe Biden.

Shiba Inu's Shytoshi Kusama Indicates 'Massive Plans' For The Crypto Project In Response to Ethereum Creator Vitalik Buterin - Benzinga

Shytoshi Kusama, the mysterious lead developer of Shiba Inu SHIB/USD, hinted at massive plans for the ecosystem while responding to Ethereum ETH/USD creator Vitalik Buterin's skepticism of projects lacking long-term ambitions.What Happened: Buterin took to social platform X to express displeasure with the mushrooming of celebrity memecoins lately. He questioned the motivations behind such cryptocurrency projects, which he believed were just benefiting celebrities and early adopters. He outlined a list of desirable traits in a celebrity cryptocurrency project that would pique his interest. Among them was the project serving some public-good goal like charity, offering some other dynamics apart from just trading the token, and finally, making something that could last for more than 10 years.Shytoshi Kusama concurred with these remarks, stating that the team had similar goals. "Well, almost exactly—we are thinking much bigger than this and on a massive scale. I’ll show this to the team for validation," Kusama emphasizedWhy It Matters: Kusama's claims come following a cryptic post a day before, which hinted at potential partnerships with Middle East policymakers.Last month, he shared a cryptic ‘EVITA' teaser, which was interpreted by many as a hint towards investments in Argentina.Of late, Shiba Inu has taken impressive strides to rise above the narrow memecoin image. Last month, the ecosystem’s decentralized exchange, ShibaSwap, was launched on its layer-2 network, Shibarium, marking a significant step in transitioning towards a self-sufficient decentralized system.Price Action: At the time of writing, SHIB was trading at $0.0000257, trading mostly flat in the last 24 hours, according to data from Benzinga Pro. Over the last month, the memecoin has grown by 3%.Read Next: Ethereum Could Soar To $22K By 2030, Predicts VanEck — Investment Giant Says Spot ETFs ‘Nearing Approval To Trade’

VanEck: previsione molto positiva sul prezzo di Ethereum

Yesterday VanEck published a very positive forecast on the price of Ethereum.
In fact, they have declared that they have increased the target for 2030 to $22,000, thanks in particular to the news about the ETF on ETH spot, the progress in terms of scaling, and the on-chain data. 


VanEck: The forecast of the price of Ethereum
The current price of ETH is around $3,800, and in fact, it has been oscillating around this level for about three months.
In the last three months, that is after the rise in February that took it from $2,300 to $4,000, it has been above the current level only at the beginning of March, while from mid-March to mid-May it had dropped to $2,800.
The year, however, had started right at the 2,300$ mark, so for now 2024 is to be considered a broadly positive year. 
Despite this, the all-time high of 2021 is still far away, because it was recorded near $4,900, so at this moment the target for the current cycle seems to be $5,000, in the medium term. 
However, it should not be forgotten that before the last great bullrun, that is in October 2020, its price was only $400, so the current price is already practically ten times higher. Furthermore, the peak of the previous cycle, recorded in January 2018, was below $1,500, that is less than half of the current levels. 
All this has allowed some analysts to project the price of ETH even to $10,000 during the current cycle, and this makes VanEck’s forecast less daring than it might appear at first glance. 
The forecast of VanEck on the price of Ethereum
The long analysis on the price of Ethereum shared by VanEck aims not only to hypothesize how the price of ETH might evolve over the next six years, but also and above all to identify the optimal portfolio allocation of investments in this cryptocurrency. 
The analysis was conducted by Matthew Sigel, head of digital asset research, Patrick Bush, senior investment analyst in digital assets, and Denis Zinoviev, associate product manager.
The starting point is precisely the spot ETH ETFs, which should be nearing completion at the beginning of July.
This would allow financial advisors and institutional investors to hold ETH with the security of qualified custodians, and to benefit from the characteristic advantages of ETFs in terms of price and liquidity without having to worry about the custody of the tokens. 
The second key point is the consideration that the Ethereum network will likely continue its rapid growth, particularly with regard to its market share compared to traditional financial market participants and Big Tech.
They even hypothesize that it could attract 66 billion dollars, which consequently should bring its market capitalization by 2030 to 2,200 billion dollars, compared to the current 460, and therefore to an ETH price of 22,000$. 
It is worth noting that at this moment Bitcoin capitalizes about 1.400 billion, and the entire crypto market does not exceed 2.800. 
This is therefore a very optimistic forecast, but it does not refer to the current cycle. 
The cycles of the crypto markets
The crypto markets follow a cycle of about 4 years dictated by the cycle of Bitcoin halving.
Ethereum was born in 2015, during the second cycle of Bitcoin and a little over a year before the second halving of BTC.
What happened in April of this year is only the third halving of BTC experienced by Ethereum, moreover with the first one experienced just over a year after its launch. 
So the first complete four-year cycle for Ethereum was the one that started in 2016 and ended in 2020, and it was precisely within that cycle that it recorded the all-time high at 1,500$ in January 2018. 
Therefore, the almost $4,900 reached in 2021 is the all-time high only of the second complete cycle of the crypto markets experienced by Ethereum. 
Furthermore, between the all-time high of the first complete cycle and that of the second, the price of ETH has marked a x3.2, and this seems to theoretically justify a rise even above $10,000 in this third complete cycle. 
At this point, the prediction of $22,000 as the maximum price for the fourth complete cycle of the crypto markets experienced by Ethereum does not seem so far-fetched, while still remaining decidedly very optimistic. 
The allocation in portfolio
In light of all these considerations, the extensive analysis by VanEck suggests that adding a modest allocation of cryptocurrencies (up to 6%) to a traditional 60/40 portfolio could substantially improve the portfolio’s Sharpe ratio, with a relatively lower impact on the drawdown. 
Within this allocation of crypto to a maximum of 6% of the 60/40 portfolio, they state that 
The allocation that provided the best risk-adjusted returns is 70% BTC and 30% ETH.
It should be noted that the hypothesis of allocating up to 6% in crypto is explicitly given as a probably good hypothesis, while the 70/30 split refers only to past performance. This seems to suggest that the crypto markets could change their general trend in the coming years. 
The analysts at VanEck also add that investors should still consider their personal risk tolerance before making similar decisions, because crypto remains a high-risk investment. 
However, I do not hide that it is precisely the data that suggests that a balanced inclusion of BTC and ETH within investment portfolios can offer enormous advantages in terms of improving returns compared to the incremental risk introduced. 
It is however necessary to highlight both that VanEck has in its portfolio both BTC and ETH, as explicitly stated at the beginning of the analysis, and that it promotes some of its derivative investment products on crypto such as ETFs.

Ethereum: The Next Digital Gold? Inside VanEck's Bullish Thesis


							

VanEck analysts predict ETH would reach $22K by 2030.



Ethereum’s potential to shake up finance and tech drives VanEck’s bullish forecast.



Spot Ether ETFs could open doors for widespread investor access.




Analysts at prominent investment firm VanEck have updated their 2030 price prediction for Ethereum (ETH), setting a new target of $22,000.



The report attributes the updated forecast to a reevaluation of Ethereum’s fundamental investment case, incorporating updated financial models and quantitative analyses on ETH’s interaction with Bitcoin in various portfolios.



Authors Matthew Sigel, Patrick Bush, and Denis Zinoviev highlight growing confidence in Ethereum’s long-term potential, driven by its strong value proposition to entrepreneurs and its potential to disrupt traditional financial markets and Big Tech.



The potential approval of spot Ether ETFs is one factor contributing to VanEck’s bullish outlook. The firm is among several on Wall Street applying to list such ETFs, following the successful launch of spot Bitcoin ETFs earlier this year. The SEC approved the 19b-4 filings for spot ether ETFs last month. 



While the approval of S-1 filings is still pending, the potential listing of spot Ether ETFs could further increase accessibility and demand for ETH.



The VanEck analysts believe that spot ether ETFs could provide a significant boost to Ethereum adoption, stating:




“This development would allow financial advisors and institutional investors to hold this unique asset with the security of qualified custodians and benefit from the pricing and liquidity advantages characteristic of ETFs.”




The analysts envision a scenario where Ethereum continues to dominate the smart contract platform space, driven by its cost-efficiency, open-source nature, and potential to disrupt traditional industries and Big Tech.









This growth could lead to significant free cash flow for token holders, resulting in a market capitalization of $2.2 trillion, or $22,000 per coin, by 2030. However, the report also acknowledges the risks associated with this projection, including regulatory uncertainties, competition, and the evolving nature of the cryptocurrency market.

Meme Coins in Retreat as Bitcoin (BTC) Struggles to Maintain $71K (Market Watch)


																Bitcoin’s price rise was stopped at just under $72,000 despite the impressive ETF inflows yesterday, and the asset has retraced by around a grand since then.
Most altcoins are also slightly in the red today following yesterday’s substantial gains, but BNB is still above $700, while LINK has dropped by 3%.
BTC Struggles at $71K
Bitcoin had a quiet weekend in which its price stood primarily around $67,500 after recovering from the late Friday dip to $66,600. However, Monday was a lot more eventful and positive for the bulls as the asset jumped by roughly three grand and briefly exceeded the coveted $70,000 mark.
Another minor retracement followed in which the cryptocurrency slipped to $68,700, but the bulls went back on the offensive on Wednesday.
This culminated in a price surge to a 15-day peak of $71,767. Thus, the primary digital asset came less than 3% away from its all-time high registered in mid-March. These gains came amid another day of massive inflows entering the US spot Bitcoin ETFs.


Thanks for subscribing, you will get your first report in the next hours!


Nevertheless, they weren’t enough to maintain BTC’s run and the cryptocurrency has retraced by around a grand and now stands just below $71,000. Its market cap has slipped below $1.4 trillion and its dominance over the alts is at 50.3% on CG.

Meme Coins in Retreat
After the massive gains registered yesterday, most larger-cap alts have turned red today. This is the case with BNB, SOL, XRP, DOGE, TON, ADA, SHIB, and DOT, but their daily retraces are quite negligible compared to their increases yesterday.
LINK and UNI have dropped slightly more (3% and 4.5%, respectively), but the former is still above $17, while the latter is north of $10.
Some of the most popular meme coins have shed more value. For instance, WIF is down by 6%, FLOKI by 5%< and BONK has dropped by 4.5%.
The total crypto market cap is down by $30 billion since yesterday’s peak but it is still close to $2.8 trillion.

Bitcoin Bull Mike Novogratz's Galaxy Digital Tokenizes $9M Antique Stradivarius Violin Into NFT For Loan Collateral - Benzinga

Cryptocurrency investment firm Galaxy Digital announced the tokenization of a nearly 300-year-old vintage violin once owned by Russian royalty. The instrument will be used as collateral to back a loan.What Happened: The firm owned by crypto billionaire and Bitcoin BTC/USD bull Michael Novogratz, minted a non-fungible token of "Empress Caterina," an 18th-century Stradivarius violin, valued at roughly $9 million, according to a press release.The NFT was created exclusively for the financing transaction between Animoca Brands co-founder Yat Siu and Galaxy. Siu purchased the iconic instrument in 2023. The NFT was created on the Ethereum ETH/USD blockchain, and featured on the NFT marketplace OpenSea. Galaxy made it clear that NFT will not be available in the secondary market.Why It Matters: Tokenization of real-world assets is emerging as one of the hottest narratives in Web3. As part of this, off-chain assets like bonds, real estate, commodities, and art can be brought on blockchain rails, unlocking a new set of use cases for both traditional and decentralized finance.In the aforementioned case, the tokenization created an economic value of the precious asset without selling it. At the same time, it helped preserve the legacy by immortalizing it in the form of an NFT.As of this writing, the real-world tokenization industry has more than $4 billion in investments, according to DeFiLlama. Read Next: Shiba Inu’s Shytoshi Kusama Indicates ‘Massive Plans’ For The Crypto Project In Response to Ethereum Creator Vitalik ButerinPhoto via ShutterstockMarket News and Data brought to you by Benzinga APIs© 2024 Benzinga.com.

Meme Coin Madness: This Trending Coin Explodes to New ATH Following Listing on KuCoin


																TL;DR

One recently-emerged frog-themed meme coin hit a new all-time high of $0.14, with a market capitalization briefly surpassing $1.4 billion.
Meme coins are seeing significant interest, pushing the overall market cap of the sector to almost $70 billion. However, their high volatility poses substantial risk to traders.


The Latest Rally
While the prices of most cryptocurrencies have either consolidated or slightly retraced in the past 24 hours, some assets continue recording substantial increases. One example is the frog-themed meme coin Brett (BRETT), which reached a new all-time high of over $0.14 (per CoinGecko’s data). Its market capitalization briefly surpassed the $1.4 billion mark before settling at its current level of $1.35 billion.

BRETT Price, Source: CoinGecko
The asset’s impressive spike coincided with KuCoin’s decision to introduce the BRETT/USDT trading pair. Additionally, the company offered a 1,200,000 BRETT giveaway to celebrate the initiative. Users will receive a certain amount of tokens as rewards for each invitee they bring on.
Other leading cryptocurrency exchanges that previously allowed services with the asset include Bitget, BitMart, Gate.io, and more. 
Crypto X is full of users envisioning that BRETT’s bull run is nowhere near its end. The cryptocurrency investor using the handle STASHER highlighted the asset’s performance, predicting a further increase to $0.20 “before actually retracing.”




“This looks like THE lower risk memecoin investment that genuinely is giving me DOGE, SHIBA, and PEPE vibes,” the analyst added.
Andrew Kang chipped in, too, claiming that BRETT “is showing strength, and it feels like the magnet to $0.20 is sooner rather than later.”
Last week, Crypto Rover – an X user with over 700,000 followers – revealed he has exposure to the asset, saying its price pump has resulted in substantial profits for him (at least on paper).
The Overall Meme Coin Mania
BRETT is not the only meme coin taking center stage as of late. The realm’s market capitalization nears the $70 billion mark, with Pepe (PEPE), Floki Inu (FLOKI), and many PolitiFi tokens witnessing impressive spikes.
Despite offering traders the chance of making substantial profits in a short period of time, dealing with meme coins can also lead to appalling losses due to the infamous volatility of the asset class.

Bitcoin (BTC) Price Resurgence, Binance Coin (BNB) Hits a New ATH, and Meme Coins Fiesta: Bits Recap June 6


																TL;DR

Bitcoin surged to $71,700 amid record inflows into US spot Bitcoin ETFs.
BNB hit an all-time high of $710, surpassing major companies’ market caps, with forecasts suggesting it could reach $1,000.
Floki Inu’s market capitalization peaked at over $3.2 billion before a slight retracement.


BTC Headed North Again
The price of the primary cryptocurrency has been on an uptrend in the past few days, rising to as high as $71,700 on June 5. Currently, it hovers the $71,000 mark (per CoinGecko’s data), representing an 11% increase on a monthly scale.
The resurgence coincided with record figures related to spot Bitcoin ETFs in the USA. Those products witnessed a total inflow of almost $900 million yesterday, the second-best day since their approval in January. 
Numerous analysts believe BTC could soar even higher in the near future, assuming certain factors are in place. The X user, Captain Faibik, predicted a rise above $90,000 should the asset surpass the “crucial resistance level” of $71,300.
On the other hand, Ali Martinez assumed that a pullback is not out of the cards based on the TD sequential, which presents a sell signal on the four-hour chart. This technical analysis tool identifies potential price exhaustion points in the market and indicates when a trend is likely to reverse. 




Still, the X user thinks a fresh uptrend could eventually follow the potential setback.
BNB’s Success
The native token of Binance—BNB—has been making the headlines recently. Its price exploded to an ATH of $710 on June 5, while its market capitalization touched the $110 billion mark. Thus, BNB surpassed well-known companies such as Airbnb, Starbucks, UBS, and more.
The new peak was met with huge enthusiasm in the crypto community, with many industry participants envisioning a further rally. 
The X users Bluntz and Sheldon The Sniper forecasted a surge toward the $1,000 milestone, while BATMAN revealed that BNB is part of their portfolio. The trader admitted hopping on the bandwagon in 2017 when a single token was worth a mere $0.60.
“Close to 1200x makes it one of my top performers, only being beaten by my RUNE call,” the analyst stated.
FLOKI’s Progress
Another cryptocurrency that recently reached a new peak price is the dog-themed meme coin – Floki Inu (FLOKI). Its market capitalization briefly exceeded the $3.2 billion mark for the first time ever, thus flipping popular altcoins, including Monero (XMR), Arbitrum (ARB), Cronos (CRO), and more.
In the following hours, though, FLOKI’s value slightly retraced, with its market cap plunging below $3 billion. Currently, the token is the 46th biggest cryptocurrency and the fifth-largest in its cohort.

Ripple’s chief technology officer (CTO), David Schwartz, known on the X social media platform (formerly Twitter) as @JoelKatz, has published a tweet to warn the XRP army against falling for a new phishing scam he has encountered on Elon Musk’s X network.Ripple CTO's scam warningDavid Schwartz shared a tweet of X user @3YearLetterman, which contains a screenshot of a direct message he had received on X recently. Schwartz commented, explaining to the XRP community that should anyone receive a DM like this, “it is fake.”The author of the message claims that he/she belongs to the X support team, and they inform the recipient that his/her account is currently “under investigation for copyright violations.” The message requires that the recipient should provide feedback on this accusation within 24 hours. To do that, he/she is required to follow a link provided in the message to complete a form. Failure to do that within the specified period of time would cause the suspension of the X account. According to the screenshot, the sender has more than 210,000 followers and joined X in December 2010 (long before Twitter was acquired by Elon Musk and rebranded as X).Schwartz warned his followers not to follow that link if they receive a similar message. He explained that the link goes to a phishing site, and users will have their X login and personal information collected there."Absolute proof I am not Satoshi": Ripple CTOApproximately a week ago, high-ranking Ripple executive Schwartz published a post to once again refute the rumor about him being the enigmatic creator of Bitcoin, Satoshi Nakamoto. The company’s CTO often has to dispel such allegations, but many within the crypto community still seem to be certain that it was Schwartz who blessed the world by creating the very first cryptocurrency.Back on that day, Schwartz published a selfie from the Consensus2024 event that showed himself and a guy wearing a glittering mask of a golden hue and a hood, hinting that this person preferred to stay anonymous - similar to Satoshi Nakamoto. “Finally, absolute proof I am not Satoshi,” Schwartz wrote.Prior to that, Schwartz tweeted that the idea of him being Satoshi was “not true but plausible.”

Cardano's Under-the-Radar Tech: What the Media Isn't Telling You


							

Cardano founder blasts crypto media for the “pathetic” negativity towards Cardano.



Hoskinson highlighted key developments set to occur in the upcoming six months.



Community builder points the media to Cardano newsletter for latest updates.




Cardano (ADA) founder, Charles Hoskinson, posted on X, expressing his disdain for a few in the crypto media, highlighting the “profound disconnect between reality and opinion with the cryptocurrency influencer and media perception of Cardano versus its actual fundamentals.”







Hoskinson pointed out that the Cardano blockchain is rapidly evolving, with several developments in progress. The upcoming hard fork is a new beginning for the blockchain that introduces substantial upgrades. The fork is to be implemented in two phases: Chang Upgrade Number One and Chang Upgrade Number Two. 



Hoskinson said that there has been remarkable growth in the community of dApps on Cardano, and the blockchain is even leading the industry in R&D scaling. He also added that a lot of good things are happening on the blockchain, listing technologies like Hydra, partner chains, Midnight, and Prism, as well as community events, Catalyst, and the constitutional convention in Argentina.









The IOHK founder also highlighted several events that would be huge within Cardano, including Rare Evo, a blockchain convention; Cardano summit, a global blockchain event; and Token 2049, another major event. Hoskinson concluded by stating:




“It’s beyond pathetic and just reflects on the low quality and low effort they put into our ecosystem.  Cardano is here to stay, and it’s a juggernaut that will drag this industry kicking and screaming if it has to towards solving the real-world economic, political, and social issues we all face.”




Hoskinson urged crypto media to rather focus on the following Cardano events:




Major blockchain upgrade: Significant hard fork to enhance features and capabilities.



Booming dApp ecosystem: Rapid growth of decentralized applications on Cardano.



Scaling Innovation: Leading R&D in blockchain scalability.



High-profile events: Participation in Rare Evo, Cardano Summit, and Token 2049.



Hydra scaling solution: Maturing technology to significantly boost transaction speed.



Community-driven initiatives: Events, catalyst projects that focus on real-world impact.




Hoskinson expressed his disappointment within parts of the crypto media, stating that he sees a focus on headlines like “Will Cardano die?” while overlooking the numerous positive developments and blockchain advancements that are due in coming months.

Dora Factory announces gas fee airdrop for Cosmos stakers


    Dora Factory, a decentralized governance technology and public goods funding platform, has announced a new gas fee airdrop of its native token, DORA, to all Cosmos (ATOM) stakers, according to the info disclosed to Finbold on June 6. 



Expected to mobilize over one million eligible addresses, the initiative is set to jumpstart the largest Minimum Anti Collusion Infrastructure (MACI) voting round in history.



Empowering the Cosmos Hub ecosystem



On June 5, ATOM stakers across the Cosmos Hub received DORA tokens, which marked a significant milestone, as the DORA token underpins Dora Vota, a decentralized governance application chain developed with the Cosmos source development kit (SDK). 







However, the new airdrop is not just a distribution of tokens — it’s a call to action for the Cosmos community. 



Known for its commitment to decentralized governance, Cosmos invites the community to partake in a democratic experiment focused on public goods funding. 



Participants can use ATOM to vote for and donate to public goods projects, support early-stage developers, and influence the distribution of an 80,000 ATOM and $200,000 USD Coin (USDC) matching pool across ten rounds of AEZ Quadratic Funding and MACI voting. 



Advancing democratic governance



The campaign is also an experiment aimed at harnessing community power to support public goods and promising nascent developers. 



The quadratic funding mechanism ensures that even small contributions from community members have a significant impact, promoting a more equal distribution of resources.



MACI privacy voting



Dora Factory is introducing MACI (Minimal Anti-Collusion Infrastructure) privacy voting, enhancing the security and anonymity of voters. 



This allows community members to express their opinions on public goods without revealing their identities. 



Those with more ATOM staked will have more voting power, or Voice Credits. 



A $20,000 USDC prize pool will be awarded to selected teams through this privacy-preserving voting process.



To facilitate widespread participation, Dora Factory will implement Dora Vota’s native Gas Station feature to cover all voting fees for the MACI voting round.

US Investment Firm Declares 'War Against Bitcoin Miners'


								Kerrisdale Capital, a US investment firm, set off a storm of reactions on Wednesday with a series of public communications aggressively targeting Bitcoin mining companies. In a multi-part thread on X, Kerrisdale announced its campaign against what it describes as “snake oil salesmen” in the BTC mining industry, accusing them of being both a financial sinkhole and an environmental hazard.
“Today, we launch a war against Bitcoin miners, an industry of snake oil salesmen that are incinerating both investor capital and the environment and should be banished from America much like the Chinese RTO frauds that we helped kick out a decade ago,” the firm declared.
Kerrisdale also revealed it had begun by sending letters to officials in Texas, including the Navarro City Commission and state senators, outlining their grievances and calling for regulatory action. Additionally, the firm disclosed its financial position, stating, “We’re short RIOT (and long Bitcoin as a hedge).”
Kerrisdale’s critique centers on the business model of RIOT Blockchain, which it argues is inherently flawed: “Like other US listed miners, RIOT’s biz model is a dysfunctional hamster wheel of cash burn, which is why it loots retail shareholders with non-stop ATM issuance to fund operations.” They pointed out that despite BTC’s high market prices, RIOT’s post-halving operations have not been profitable.

Further financial analysis from Kerrisdale highlighted that RIOT has issued $2.3 billion in stock since 2020, which has led to a sixfold increase in shares outstanding to fund $1.6 billion in cash burn. According to Kerrisdale, this has not corresponded with an increase in Bitcoin production per share or BTC holdings per share, leading them to conclude that the only benefit to shareholders would come from rising Bitcoin prices—a strategy they deemed insufficient for investment.
On the environmental front, Kerrisdale criticized Bitcoin mining for its heavy energy use and reliance on incentives that may not align with broader environmental goals. “RIOT’s economics would look even worse without generous grid incentives and tax credits,” the firm argued, noting that such benefits are being questioned by regulators and might not persist.
The Bitcoin Mining Industry And Experts Responds
The industry response was quick, with several prominent figures defending the sector and attacking Kerrisdale’s motives and understanding of the space. Daniel Batten, founder of CH4 Capital and advisory board member at Bitcoin mining giant Marathon, suggested Kerrisdale should focus more on enhancing investor returns rather than attacking industry practices.


Adam O of Upstream Data defended Bitcoin mining’s environmental impact, stating, “Good luck vilifying that which improves all stakeholders, reduces waste, and reduces methane emissions. Dumbest mission of the decade.” Steven Lubka, Head of Private Clients & Family Offices at Swan Bitcoin, criticized Kerrisdale’s strategy and pointed to the failing MicroStrategy (MSTR) short position which they entered two months ago as well as their declining assets under management as a sign of deeper issues within the firm itself.

“Let’s take a look at these absolute losers crying for the government to rescue their MSTR short by FUD’ing mining. […] Now let’s take a look at their AUM. $318m as of this quarter, let’s see where they were a few years ago? $1.3 billion. That’s a big drop in their total AUM/invested amount. In conclusion, they are trying to save their fund because they know MSTR is about to rip higher by appealing to the government.”
The debate also extended to the environmental merits of Bitcoin mining. Simon Dixon, an angel investor, presented facts debunking the myth that Bitcoin mining is predominantly harmful to the environment. He highlighted the role of Bitcoin mining in methane emission mitigation and its synergies with renewable energy sources such as solar and wind, as well as the ability to help balance the grid.


Mark Harvey, a Bitcoin educator, just stated, “You will make a higher ROI + more friends by just buying and holding Bitcoin.”
At press time, BTC traded at $70,820.

Bitcoin's Price Surge Fuels Speculation of New Bull Market


							

Bitcoin surged past $71k on Wednesday, awakening the crypto market.



Total 3’s setup suggests altcoins are preparing for a surge, in line with the emerging bull run.



Many altcoins started rallying, with BNB reaching a new ATH at $716.2.




Bitcoin (BTC) surged above $71,700 on Wednesday, and Crypto Banter presenter Sheldon the Sniper believes the crypto market is reawakening with vigor. In a video, Sheldon emphasized how Bitcoin’s price movement triggered a short squeeze across altcoins, leading to strong market performance for many.



The crypto analyst showcased the “Crypto Total Market Cap Excluding Bitcoin and Ethereum (Total 3)” in his analysis, revealing the metric’s potential upward trajectory. Traders use Total 3 chart to gauge altcoin performance relative to Bitcoin, providing insights into investor sentiment and capital flows between BTC and altcoins.



 
 




With Bitcoin nearing its All-Time High (ATH), Sheldon asserted that it would soon enter the “optimism stage,” where the flagship crypto could experience parabolic moves. He compared BTC’s recent price action to the last bull cycle, suggesting a similar scenario could unfold. He encouraged traders/investors to prepare their portfolios for a potential bull run.



Having confirmed Bitcoin’s bullish setup, Sheldon noted that altcoins were poised to follow suit. He cited decreasing Bitcoin dominance and the already-rallying Total 3 as key indicators of an impending altcoin rally.



Meanwhile, many altcoins have already begun displaying bullish signals, as Sheldon demonstrated using the “banter bubbles.” Altcoins like UNI, ORDI, and FLOKI have posted impressive gains. The analyst highlighted Solana’s performance, noting how its token, SOL, has begun to surge. However, he attributed SOL’s rally to the influence of Solana-based tokens, advising those interested to monitor them closely.

Altcoins: Analyzing Key Signs For A Potential Boom - Or Bust


																Altcoins are generating significant buzz among cryptocurrency watchers, as rumors of a potential Bitcoin breakout circulate. After weeks of sluggish trading, a recent surge of capital has revitalized the king of coins. This raises a pressing question: will altcoins ride the wave, or are they doomed to be left behind?

	Related Reading


Whispers Of A Bitcoin Bonanza
Data from Farside Investors reveals a significant shift in investor sentiment. Nearly $890 million flowed into Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) on June 4th, a clear sign of renewed interest. This surge in buying could act as a catalyst, sparking a wave of speculation and propelling Bitcoin prices upwards.
However, the question remains: how will this newfound focus on Bitcoin impact the broader cryptocurrency market? Historically, strong Bitcoin rallies have often been followed by altcoin seasons, periods where alternative cryptocurrencies experience explosive growth. But is this time different?
Altcoin Season: Just Over The Horizon?
The Altcoin Season Index, a metric that gauges market sentiment towards altcoins, currently sits at a lowly 35. This stands in stark contrast to the readings of 80 observed just six months ago. This suggests that altcoins are not yet basking in the reflected glory of Bitcoin’s potential rise.
Source: BlockchainCentre
Experts believe that even with a Bitcoin surge, only a select few altcoins are likely to outperform the market leader. To truly unleash an altcoin season, the Altcoin Season Index would need to climb above 75, a sign of widespread bullishness across the entire altcoin ecosystem.
Why Altcoins Might Struggle To Shine
The sheer number of altcoins compared to previous cycles also throws a wrench into the altcoin season equation. In 2017 and 2021, for instance, the altcoin market was a much smaller pond. When Bitcoin surged, investor money flowed more readily into a smaller pool of altcoins, leading to significant price increases across the board.
As of today, the market cap of cryptocurrencies stood at $2.5 trillion. Chart: TradingView.com
Today, the landscape is vastly different. With thousands of altcoins vying for investor attention, any gains during an altcoin season might be concentrated in just a handful of high-performing projects, leaving the vast majority behind.
Bitcoin Dominance: A Key Indicator To Watch
Another crucial factor to consider is Bitcoin Dominance (BTC.D). This metric reflects Bitcoin’s market capitalization as a percentage of the total crypto market cap. Historically, a significant decline in BTC.D has coincided with altcoin seasons. In early 2021, for example, the coin’s dominance level plummeted from 70% to 40%, paving the way for a period of explosive altcoin growth.

	Related Reading


Currently, however, BTC.D is on the rise, suggesting that altcoins are not yet the center of attention. Investors looking for altcoin opportunities should keep a close eye on this metric, as a sustained downtrend in the crypto’s dominance could be a harbinger of an approaching altcoin season.

Vitalik Buterin's 3 Pillars for Legitimate Celebrity-Backed Tokens


							

Vitalik Buterin proposes 3 standards for “respectable” celebrity crypto projects.



Projects should prioritize social good and offer interactive features. 



Long-term sustainability is key, not short-term gains.




Vitalik Buterin, co-founder of Ethereum, the world’s second-largest blockchain platform, advocates for greater responsibility in celebrity-backed cryptocurrency ventures. In a tweet, Buterin outlined three key features he believes such projects should possess to be considered “respectable.”







Firstly, Buterin emphasizes the importance of a commitment to a “public good goal.” This means the project should prioritize a charitable or social cause it supports, aiming for a positive impact beyond simply enriching the celebrity and early investors.



Secondly, he proposes “engaging mechanics.” Going beyond just trading a token, the project should offer interactive features. Buterin cites token-based DAOs as an option, though with reservations. DAOs allow communities to govern in a decentralized manner through token ownership.



Finally, Buterin stresses on the importance of “sustainability.” Celebrity crypto projects shouldn’t be short-lived fads. He urges them to be designed for long-term viability, something participants would value even if the token’s value depreciates.









Buterin’s comments come amidst a surge in celebrity involvement with cryptocurrencies. While some ventures aim for social good, others raise concerns about potential profiteering and a lack of long-term vision.



In closing, he alluded to a blog post he’d written a decade ago, published before Ethereum’s launch, which discussed using token issuance to fund important public causes. This suggests he sees a strong link between responsible crypto and positive social impact.

Mantle price outlook: Here’s why MNT is soaring - CoinJournal



                    

                    
Mantle price rose 6% to above $1.04, with gains coming as Bitcoin (BTC) retested the $71k level.
MNT price had struggled to break out of a tight range.
Network developments and the overall crypto market outlook could help MNT price higher.

Mantle (MNT) price currently changes hands around $1.04 after jumping more than 6% in the past 24 hours alongside Bitcoin’s spike to above $71,000. 
The cryptocurrency’s daily trading volume is up 110% to over $13o million in this period as Mantle trends among the best performers in the top 100 coins by market cap.
MNT price surges amid crypto bounce
Today’s gains for MNT price came as Bitcoin price surge to above $71k, with bulls taking advantage as spot BTC ETFs recorded an 11th consecutive trading day of net inflows.
Analysts are bullish on BTC, and projections for ETH amid spot Ethereum ETF approval could also contribute to MNT price going up.
Notably, MNT surged more than 40% in March, breaking above $1 as bullish momentum eventually pushed the token’s value to an all-time high above $1.50 in April.
While MNT benefitted from listing on South Korea’s largest crypto exchange Upbit, the parabolic rise that catapulted BTC to its ATH may also have fueled the upswing. The project’s introduction of the Mantle Rewards Station also added to the positive sentiment.
Mantle price – are bulls ready to run?
While MNT price has struggled since dipping below $1.40 in mid-April, it’s likely a new push in the SocialFi and gaming dApps space has Mantle poised for a fresh rally.
Mantle recently revealed it had deployed a $5 million ecosystem fund to support projects such as MetaCene, Blade Games, Co-Museum and Fingerlabs. The initiative has boosted the network’s protocols across lending, liquid staking, DEX, yield and RWA.
Data from DeFiLlama indicates the Total Value Locked (TVL) across these projects has nearly doubled in the past month. Per the details, Mantle TVL currently stands at around $463 million, up from approximately $252 million in early May.

MNT price on the daily chart is within a key range marked by the Bollinger bands. If bulls break higher, a decisive move above $1.10 may allow for a retest of the resistance line at $1.26.
The RSI and MACD indicators, however, suggest bears are not completely out of the picture. Primary support levels in case of a downward flip would include $0.94 and $0.78.

Memecoin That’s Exploded Over 1,000% in Four Months Set To Skyrocket by Over 3x, According to Crypto Analyst - The Daily Hodl


								A closely followed crypto analyst believes that one red-hot Dogecoin (DOGE) rival is gearing up for more massive gains.
Pseudonymous trader Kaleo tells his 641,600 followers on the social media platform X that Floki (FLOKI)’s market cap could soar to at least $10 billion, more than 3x the current value.










The analyst says Floki could head much after forming a cup-and-handle pattern, a bullish technical indicator.
“Don’t need a fancy chart here. Just look at FLOKI zoomed out. 

Retesting its 2021 all-time high. 
Clean high time frame cup and handle. 
BNB is on the verge of price discovery. 
Memecoin super cycle. 

This sends to $10 billion plus on the next leg up easily.”
Source: Kaleo/X
The analyst compares Floki’s current price pattern to another red-hot memecoin, Pepe (PEPE), before its sudden rise.
He also believes that Floki is benefiting from being based on Binance’s BNB Chain while BNB, the native token of the BNB Chain, is in an uptrend.
“Low timeframe FLOKI does look a lot like PEPE did before its last move higher. It has a similar narrative as well: PEPE being a high ETH beta meme play, FLOKI being a high BNB beta meme play.”
Floki, with a current market cap of $3.1 billion, is trading for $0.0003182 at time of writing, up more than 1,000% since trading for $0.0000269 four months ago on February 5th.

Exploring the Cosmos Network and the Recent Outage

On June 5, the Cosmos Hub blockchain network experienced an outage lasting around four hours due to a bug discovered during the implementation of the v17 upgrade.The Cosmos team stated that the bug was a Liquid Staking Module (LSM) security vulnerability. While developers swiftly identified and resolved the bug, block production on the network did not resume until most validators had implemented the patch. It stated:“The teams at Informalinc and HyphaDoesCosmos have issued a fix for the bug that was found. We’re currently at 55% of validators who have implemented the patch. We encourage any remaining validators who have not yet implemented the patch to do so.”According to information on the firm’s official X handle, the network began producing blocks at around 12:30 A.M. GMT. The firm also mentioned that its developers would release a detailed post-mortem report.Ethan Buchman, the co-founder of Cosmos, explained that downtime for the “Hub is rare, but it happens.” He added:“Bugs will happen. Chains will go down. Chains will come back up. Important thing is to have dedicated devs and validators working to fix issues when they arise.”The Cosmos Hub aims to create thousands of interconnected blockchains within the Cosmos Network. It operates on a proof-of-stake consensus mechanism, enabling participants to stake their ATOM coins and earn rewards.Interestingly, the network issues had little impact on the ATOM token, which remained stable at $8.65 as of press time, up 0.67%.v17 upgradeThe v17 upgrade was one of the most anticipated updates within the Cosmos ecosystem recently. According to data from Mintscan, over 136 million ATOM tokens, equivalent to 99.8% of the total votes, supported it.The upgrade introduces features from the “partial set security” proposal to the Cosmos ecosystem. Blockhunters, a web3 staking infrastructure provider, stated:“This feature allows new consumer chains to customize validator participation and set various operational parameters, such as voting power caps and opt-in choices for validators.”Moreover, Buchman also described the upgrade as “the biggest in at least a year,” adding that it brings “the long-awaited ICS2.0.”Mentioned in this articleLatest Alpha Market Report

Economist Expecting $350,000 in Bitcoin Announces the Two Altcoins He Bought! - Bitcoin Sistemi

Robert Kiyosaki, an economist and author of the book “Rich Dad Poor Dad”, who has been advising people to buy Bitcoin for a long time, explained his expectations for two major cryptocurrencies other than BTC while maintaining his bullish stance on the BTC price.
At this point, Kiyosaki, who shared from his account


Stating that he also bought Ethereum (ETH) and Solana (SOL) besides Bitcoin, the famous name said that he believes that BTC, ETH and SOL will continue their rise.
Stating that the US economy will get worse due to the administration, Kiyosaki thinks that alternative assets such as Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies will protect investors from this situation.





Finally, criticizing US President Joe Biden, Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen and FED President Jerome Powell, Kiyosaki said:

“It's no lie that Bitcoin will be $350,000 by August 25, 2024. This is a prediction.
I'm sure Bitcoin will reach $350,000 in 2024, but that's just a target.
I continue to buy more Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Solana because I'm pretty sure their prices will continue to rise.
Why am I so sure? Because I'm sure about BTC, Ethereum and Solana? My answer is no.
What I trust is the incompetence of our leaders, President Biden, Treasury Secretary Yellin, and Fed Chairman Powell. These three are the real-life Stooges and I'm sure I have a lot of confidence in their incompetence. Be careful. Buy more Gold, Silver, Bitcoin, Solana and Ethereum.”

Pavel Aramyan: Happy to meet you, everybody! thanks for hosting me today @cryptosoka
BIC: Ok, Pavel, let’s start our AMA with this point: Can you please provide an overview of the Bahamit.io project and its mission in the blockchain space? 👀
Pavel Aramyan: Gladly. So Bahamut is a layer 1, permissionless, public blockchain. It’s a fork of Ethereum v2.0 and utilizes a new consensus called PoSA (Proof of Stake and Activity). The core idea of PoSA is to further reward validators that have active smart contracts on-chain – active as in Gas is being spent to interact with these smart contracts. The more the activity, the higher the chance to be elected as a block producer, and thus, the more rewards can be earned from the network.
BIC: 😯😯😯Could you tell us more about the DeFi projects that were successfully launched on the Bahamut blockchain?
Pavel Aramyan:
Recently, Lolik – liquid staking, Mutuari – lending, and Silkswap – decentralized exchange prototypes have been launched in Bahamut. Lolik is currently boasting close to 15 million staked FTN, which is about $30 million in just a few months of operations. Mutuari is a decentralized lending protocol that allows to stake collateral assets and borrow others – most commonly stable coins like USDT and USDC. Silkswap, as a DEX, makes it easy to navigate between different tokens on-chain and swap one to the other at any point in time.
BIC: And how do the Bahamut Foundation’s grants support new participants? What do you look for in projects applying for these grants?
Pavel Aramyan: So the foundation offers its support in marketing, advice, and of course, FTNs. As a rule of thumb, all projects are welcome to apply regardless of their sphere as the Foundation looks through each single application. Applicants are requested to fill-in some initial/general information and upload a pitch deck of their product/service, and after review, if the initial stage is passed, a video call is organized to get a feel of the team’s experience, review the demo (if available) and to clear further possible questions. At the final stage, the applicants can be accepted as grant-ies, and the distribution is usually split into milestones or paid in full after the product is delivered.
The foundation takes into account the team’s experience and dedication to their work as priorities.
BIC: How does the Bahamut Foundation measure the impact and success of its initiatives in the DeFi, gaming, and NFT sectors? 👀
Pavel Aramyan: These are mostly measured by the number of Bahamut addresses, active players/addresses for deployed games, as well as the number of NFT collections on marketplaces. Also, there are key metrics that are unique for every type of product and should be revised accordingly. For example, liquidity thresholds for various products or continuous updates to the protocol and enhancing services. The global idea is to incentivize the applicants to continuously improve their products and keep it alive.

BIC: Btw, what strategies does the Bahamut Foundation employ to ensure ongoing support and success for the projects that have already been launched??
Pavel Aramyan: If the projects have been grant participants, there are certain criteria – different for each project as I already mentioned – that make them eligible for further funding when met. Also, the PoSA consensus plays its own role – the better applications one creates, the more rewards one earns due to being able to create more blocks and participate in the consensus matters more often, which can be considered as a secondary income flow by some apps. 
As a numbers example, I can say that IF Ethereum was working with PoSA consensus, somebody like uniswap would be earning around 1500 ETH/monthly, just due to their activity in the network, we ran this simulation a while ago. Given the current pricing of Ethereum, that’s nothing to scuff at 😄
BIC: Let’s talk about the meetups organized by the Bahamut Foundation 🔥What has been the community response to them, and how do these events enhance the blockchain community?
Pavel Aramyan: Community meetups have always been well-received since the people are keen to learn, especially when it comes to blockchain. The meetups are first and foremost for educating the community on both technical and business aspects of blockchain and web3. As a result, you get more educated users, which in turn leads them to want to learn more, which leads to wider web3 adoption – which we believe should be a common cause among all web3 products and businesses nowadays.
BIC: And can you share insights on the Bahamut meetups, particularly the ones that happened in Dubai?
Pavel Aramyan: The Dubai community meetup had been a blast. Not only was it the first meetup in the FtNFT store in Dubai, but also the community was genuinely interested and keen to learn about Fastex, Bahamut, and web3 as a whole. We had a number of lectures regarding technology, leadership, and legal aspects in the world of web3, which were wrapped with a cozy networking event right after, as is the custom for all meetups.
BIC: What about other events? How did the Bahamut Foundation’s participation at Paris Blockchain Week contribute to your goals, and what were the key takeaways from this event?
Pavel Aramyan: As a matter of fact, we place a lot of influence on real-time events, which is why you can find us being present in over 50 events annualy. In particular, Paris blockchain week was one of these events that have a very respectable community and as a result, Bahamut aquired numerous grant applicants, partnerships and integrations that are currently being implemented.
BIC: Over 50 events annually 🤯🤯🤯
Pavel Aramyan: mind-boggling I know 😄
BIC: Pavel, I’ve heard about your educational programs. Could you please tell us about it more? Does Bahamut Foundation plan any new collaborations with local or international universities?
Pavel Aramyan: So this has been a new venture for the foundation, and the idea is to establish some kind of an educational portal/session/even semester for Master’s degree and above students, who’re interested in learning about the technology. The collaboration with minor courses (1-2 months long) is already underway with the State University in Yerevan, with more collaborations and semester-long courses to follow in the near future. 
We believe that proper education (even if it’s just the basics) will be a key nail-driver in securing a bright future for blockchain and web3 usage in general, simply since not being alienated to a topic is already a big win in many cases.
the “oh I’ve heard about this before” vs the “well, this sounds too complicated, I’ll pass” can go a long way
BIC: WOW!!! How does Bahamut support outstanding students within these educational programs, and what are the criteria for receiving the scholarships? 👀👀👀 
Pavel Aramyan: Since this is just the start, we haven’t had any students actually complete the course, but the idea is to offer them a job (part-time, full-time, internship) depending on the results and recruit young blood into the space. And as we all know, youngsters are always more keen on the unknown and happy to explore it to its ends, which basically results in an educated community and people who care about web3.
BIC: Now I want to be a student again 😂
Pavel Aramyan: ha! Now, that’s a term I thought I’d never say after I graduated myself, but I would’ve liked that, too 😄
BIC: Finally, could you share any upcoming events or announcements that enthusiasts and potential collaborators should look forward to? 😏

Pavel Aramyan: Sure, so as I said you can find us on many major industry events so expect to see us in Singapore, Dubai, Amsterdam, Hong-kong and other spots in the next few months. 
As for announcements, there are gonna be up to 30 additional grant distributions in the next quarter, as well as numerous integrations and infrastructure additions.
BIC: Great! Now let’s move to my favorite part — questions from our Community 🖤I saw you have chosen the next questions 👇
Pavel Aramyan: lets get to it!
BIC: @AppleChichi: 
How does Bahamut’s new approach to the distribution of block validation rewards differ from traditional blockchain reward mechanisms, and what advantages does it offer to validators and the network as a whole?
Pavel Aramyan: ok, so this is a very good one since it highlights the PoSA advantages. So what we have with Activity is that it’s a parameter in the blockchain code that the consensus is programmed to take into account when distributing the chance to become a block producer in the future. 
Now validators that have active smart contracts deployed on the network have a much higher chance to be elected again and again, versus traditional PoS systems where the chance is the same for everybody. This is a small yet fundamental tweak to the PoS consensus since it sees and recognizes these validators as participants who bring value to others (because others are willing to spend gas to interact with these contracts), thus, they should be rewarded appropriately, in a decentralized manner.
For example, you could choose to deploy an ERC20 (or, in our case BHRC20) token on Bahamut, and with every transfer from wallet A to wallet B, you’ll build up activity as the deployer of this token. As a result, the more transfers happen, the more you’ll be able to earn from the network in the form of fees. And this model can be implemented for any other smart contract application.
BIC: 
The next one is by @VuongKy3:
What specific industries or use cases is Bahamut targeting with its public blockchain solution, and how does its unique reward distribution mechanism benefit these applications?
Pavel Aramyan: So the beauty of PoSA is that it doesn’t care what industry you’re from, as long as you create GOOD smart contracts since this is what people will be willing to use, and in that case, you get activity. And the blockchain recognizes this and rewards everyone accordingly, in proportion to the total activity pool in the chain. 

This is why this can be considered universal, since every type of business will be able to benefit from this type consensus. 
BIC: @JuliusDunham asks:
How does Bahamut handle scalability and transaction throughput? Are there any innovative technologies or protocols implemented to manage high transaction volumes and network congestion?
Pavel Aramyan: So, currently, Bahamut functions exactly like Ethereum in terms of speed and scalability. We’re also implementing second-layer scaling solutions currently and looking into sharding technologies to overcome these issues. Like Ethereum, we value decentralization more than any other factor when it comes to blockchain operations, and this is why we have chosen it as our working platform.
BIC: @wangsu4:
How does Bahamut ensure decentralization and prevent the concentration of power among a small number of validators or stakeholders? What governance mechanisms are in place to support this objective?
Pavel Aramyan: Bahamut currently has over 4400 validators in its network. With decentralization in mind and PoSA, we encourage everyone to become a validator to be able to participate in the activity generation, as a result creating a healthy atmosphere for everyone involved. 

Because you can only benefit from activity if you’re a validator on Bahamut, and every smart contract can be linked to one validator, if you’re looking to create value for yourself, you’ll need to operate a full node on-chain. This results in good spread among validators and secures the chain from countless threats that come with centralization possibilities.
BIC: And the last one — @EzequielMarrero:
In terms of interoperability, how does Bahamut facilitate interactions with other blockchain networks and existing financial systems? Are there any specific protocols or partnerships that enhance cross-chain compatibility?
Pavel Aramyan: Bahamut is very keen on interoperability and creating a vibrant “blockchain-to-blockchain” atmosphere in web3. We’re always looking to integrate existing protocols that have interoperability in their fundamentals as a top priority. Currently, Symbiosis bridge offers the ability to migrate assets from other chains to Bahamut, with 8 more interoperability protocol integrations currently in discussion and/or finalization stages.
BIC: Cool! Pavel, thank you for being here today 🖤Pavel Aramyan: thanks for hosting me @cryptosoka!
Final thoughts
Through the unique PoSA consensus, Bahamut rewards active validators and drives substantial network engagement. The successful launch of DeFi projects like Lolik, Mutuari, and Silkswap showcases the platform’s potential and the foundation’s commitment to supporting innovative projects through grants and community initiatives. 
With a focus on education, ongoing support for projects, and a keen eye on interoperability, Bahamut is poised to make significant contributions to the blockchain industry. As Aramyan hinted, exciting developments and new opportunities are on the horizon, promising a bright future for both Bahamut and its growing community.

Bitcoin in El Salvador: A Three-Year Overview


Three years ago, President Nayib Bukele’s decision to make Bitcoin (BTC) legal tender in El Salvador made headlines around the globe. On September 7, 2021, the “Bitcoin Law” came into effect, making El Salvador the first country to adopt Bitcoin as an official currency.
Since then, the nation has experienced significant economic and social shifts, highlighting the impact and potential of this bold move.
The Rise and Fall of Bitcoin’s Value: Impact on El Salvador

El Salvador’s embrace of Bitcoin has been mixed with challenges and successes. The country now holds over $411 million in Bitcoin, with a more than 5,772 BTC portfolio.

President Nayib Bukele was recently sworn in for a second term, reinforcing his pro-Bitcoin stance. The country has continued to purchase Bitcoin, acquiring up to 30 BTC per month. As of May, El Salvador had more than $70 million in unrealized profits from its Bitcoin investments.

“Let’s not lose perspective. Here we are not just changing a country, we are changing a paradigm. We have already accomplished more than anyone could have imagined. Other people would like to have what we have now,” Bukele declared during his re-election.

Despite the crypto market’s volatility, El Salvador’s government remains unwavering in its support for Bitcoin. The government has preserved its Bitcoin holdings and consistently invests in them. Moreover, El Salvador continues to integrate the asset into various sectors of the economy.
For instance, Salvadorian citizens can use BTC to pay for goods and services, taxes, and even through the official Chivo Wallet. The government has also implemented policies and incentives to attract crypto investments, including citizenship and mining services passports.

El Salvador has also invested in Bitcoin mining using volcanic energy. The state plant on the Tecapa volcano operates around 300 processors, capitalizing on the country’s geothermal resources. This investment comes when Bitcoin’s mining difficulty has reached an all-time high, highlighting the nation’s innovative approach.
Recent developments have further strengthened El Salvador’s Bitcoin journey. First, the first Bitcoin spot exchange-traded funds (ETF) approval in January 2024 raised BTC’s price from $41,670 to over $70,000 in just a few months.
Read more: Bitcoin (BTC) Price Prediction 2024/2025/2030
Additionally, the fourth Bitcoin halving on April 20 reduced mining rewards from 6.25 BTC to 3.125 BTC per block, potentially increasing BTC’s price and profitability. Experts predict Bitcoin could rise to $100,000 by the end of the year, with some estimates suggesting it could reach $150,000 by 2025. Such growth could significantly boost El Salvador’s BTC profits.

Hedera (HBAR) Futures Traders Eye Bullish Recovery


Hedera (HBAR) has witnessed a steady decline in its value in the past few weeks. In the past 30 days, its price has decreased by almost 10%. 
However, despite this, the altcoin’s futures traders have maintained a bullish bias toward it as they continue to demand long positions. 
Hedera Futures Traders Bears a Burden

At press time, Hedera (HBAR) traded at $0.1031. During the last month, its price peaked at $0.12 on May 17 and has since declined by 16%.
Despite the fall in altcoins’ prices over the past few weeks, their future market activity has continued to grow. First, their open interest has trended upward since the beginning of the month. At $60 million as of this writing, HBAR’s futures open interest has surged by 18% since June 1.
An asset’s futures open interest measures the total number of its outstanding futures contracts or positions that have not been closed or settled. When it spikes, it signals that more participants are entering the market to open new positions.

In addition to HBAR’s rising open interest, its funding rate across cryptocurrency exchanges has remained positive. This trend has been since May 3, when the altcoin last recorded a negative funding rate.

Funding rates are used in perpetual futures contracts to ensure the contract price stays close to the spot price. 
When an asset’s futures funding rate is positive, there is a strong demand for long positions. It suggests that more traders are buying an asset in anticipation of a price increase than those expecting a dip.
HBAR Price Prediction: Price Trends Within a Range
The bias is different in the token’s spot market. Many buyers and sellers have avoided trading HBAR due to the uncertainty regarding its next price direction.

HBAR’s price traded close to its 20-day exponential moving average (EMA) at press time, confirming that the market was in consolidation. 
Hedera Price Analysis. Source: TradingView
An asset’s 20-day EMA tracks the average price of an asset over the past 20 days. When price trades close to this key moving average, it signals a period of sideways movement, with no strong uptrend or downtrend.
If buying momentum surges due to the activity of HBAR’s futures traders, its price might rally to $0.105.

However, if bear power grows and selling pressure mounts, HBAR’s price may fall to $0.09

Bitcoin halving fallout: Crypto trading drops 20% in May - AMBCrypto



Crypto trading volumes hit second monthly low post-BTC halving event. 
Derivatives dominated the crypto market at +70% because of ETH ETF speculation.

The typical financial lull associated with summer seems to be playing out in crypto markets. 
In May, crypto trading activity fell by 20%, marking the second month of a drop in trading volume across major exchanges, per a CCData report. 
Part of the report cited the ‘rangebound’ market for the trend and read, 
‘In May, the combined spot and derivatives trading volume on centralised exchanges fell 20.1% to $5.27tn as the prices of major digital assets continued to trend rangebound following the Bitcoin halving event in March.’
A downtrend in crypto trading volume
Source: CCData
The report noted that in the spot market segment, May’s trading volumes across centralized exchanges dropped 21.6% to $1.57 trillion, lower than the +$2 trillion volumes hit in April. 
Based on individual exchanges, Binance was the top contender on the spot market trading volume at $545 trillion in May. In descending order, other exchanges that followed Binance’s lead were Bybit, OKX, Coinbase, and Gate.io. 
However, each exchange recorded key drops in trading volumes in May compared to April. 
On year-to-date performance on the spot market share, Binance saw the most significant gains and ramped up its dominance to 34.6%. 
Bybit, Bitget, and XT.com also surged in market share over the same period. But Coinbase saw a modest decline while Upbit, OKX, and MEXC Global recorded ‘the greatest decline in market share.’
Derivative market dominance surge to 70%
However, money in the crypto market was concentrated mainly in the derivatives market. Per the report,
‘The derivatives market now represents 70.1% of the entire crypto market (vs 69.5% in April).’ 
Source: CCData
Despite the spike in derivative market dominance, overall trading volumes were subdued like the spot market. The report noted that, 
‘Derivatives volumes decreased by 19.4% in May to $3.69tn, recording the second consecutive decline in monthly derivatives volume.’ 
Unlike the typical sluggish financial activity in TradFi during the summer, the report attributed the low volumes to historical patterns associated with low activity after the Bitcoin halving events. 
Amidst the lull, the report noted that traders were still bullish, based on an uptick in funding rates and a surge in Ethereum [ETH] option volumes on US ETH ETFs speculation. 
‘Across the four exchanges analysed, the average funding rates continued to decline, reaching 3.23%. However, the funding rate started trending upwards on May 23rd as traders turned bullish after the SEC’s surprise pivot on the Spot Ethereum ETF applications.’

Bitcoin Spot ETFs Record 17 Straight Inflow Days, Reaching $15.3B Year-To-Date - Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (BTC) Common Units of fractional undivided beneficial interest (ARCA:GBTC) - Benzinga

Bitcoin spot exchange-traded funds (ETFs) continued their impressive streak of net inflows on June 5, attracting a total of $488 million. What Happened: This marks the 17th consecutive day of positive inflows for these investment vehicles, according to data from SoSo Value.This brings the historical cumulative net inflow of Bitcoin spot ETFs to $15.338 billion.Individual ETFs such as Grayscale‘s GBTC saw a single-day inflow of $14.5802 million, Fidelity‘s FBTC recorded $221 million, and BlackRock‘s IBIT achieved $155 million in inflows. Ark Invest’s ARKB saw a $71 million inflow.QCP Capital reported that Bitcoin ETFs continue to attract significant investment, with $488.1 million in net inflows recorded on June 5. The firm also observed increased call buying activity, targeting a potential $100,000 strike for July. This optimistic outlook is partly driven by an unexpectedly low jobless claims report and the anticipated Consumer Price Index (CPI) release next week, which could trigger a new all-time high for Bitcoin BTC/USD.Also Read: Potential Email Vendor Breach Puts Crypto Companies On AlertAdditionally, there is speculation that the market might factor in potential rate cuts, adding further momentum to the rally.However, Ethereum’s performance has lagged behind Bitcoin. SEC Chair Gary Gensler on Wednesday indicated that the approval process for Ethereum spot ETFs “will take some time.”This delay is expected to keep Ethereum‘s ETH/USD short-term performance subdued compared to Bitcoin. Despite this, analysts at QCP Capital suggest that Ethereum will eventually outperform Bitcoin once the ETF starts trading. They recommend accumulating Ethereum at a discount now to benefit from the expected future price appreciation.What’s Next: As the digital asset market continues to evolve, these developments will be a focal point at the upcoming Benzinga Future of Digital Assets event on Nov. 19.Read Next: Coinbase Launches Smart Wallets To Simplify Crypto OnboardingImage: Shutterstock

'Bitcoin Jesus' Roger Ver Released on Bail in Spain - Decrypt

Cryptocurrency entrepreneur Roger Ver, also known as "Bitcoin Jesus," has been released on bail in Spain after posting a €150,000 bail.According to a Bloomberg report, Ver was permitted to leave jail May 17, on condition that he hand in his passport and remain in Spain pending a decision on his extradition to the U.S., where he faces $50 million tax evasion charges. Ver must also report to court every two days.Ver was arrested by Spanish authorities in April, after the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) unsealed an indictment alleging that he had evaded paying almost $50 million in taxes, in addition to charges of mail fraud and filing false tax returns.In the indictment, the DOJ alleges that after Ver renounced his U.S. citizenship and obtained citizenship in St. Kitts and Nevis, he failed to report capital gains or pay taxes on his holdings of 131,000 BTC.Ver is accused of providing false or misleading information to the law firm and appraiser who prepared tax returns relating to his expatriation, undervaluing two of his companies that held 73,000 of his BTC holdings and failing to report his personal holdings.In November 2017, Ver sold "tens of thousands" of Bitcoin for around $240 million in cash—sales that he was legally required to report to the IRS, along with his receipt of Bitcoin from the two firms.“In total, Ver is alleged to have caused a loss to the IRS of at least $48 million,” the indictment read.Who is Roger Ver?Ver, an outspoken libertarian, was an early adopter and Bitcoin evangelist, earning his nickname "Bitcoin Jesus" for giving away the cryptocurrency for free.He subsequently shifted his attention to Bitcoin Cash, a hard fork of the original cryptocurrency, which he maintains is the “truest representation of Satoshi’s vision.”Ver has had run-ins with the law before; in 2002, he was sentenced to 10 months in jail for selling explosives on eBay.In a 2019 talk, he argued that, "It’s the law breakers that move society forward," adding that, "If it wasn’t for people who break the law, we’d still have slavery. We’d still have people sitting at the back of the bus. The people who have the courage to break the law, have the ability to make the world a better place."Daily Debrief NewsletterStart every day with the top news stories right now, plus original features, a podcast, videos and more.

AI sets Ethereum (ETH) price for June 30, 2024


    As many assets in the cryptocurrency market start to resume their price increases, the sector’s largest altcoin – Ethereum (ETH) – has been one of them, and machine learning and artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms are fairly optimistic about its progress for the next several weeks.



Indeed, Ethereum has been riding the current bullish wave in the crypto sphere, heightened by the exceptionally positive prediction by investment giant VanEck, which sees the second largest asset in the cryptoverse by market capitalization, reaching a whopping $22,000 by 2030.



Ethereum price prediction



In terms of its price prognosis for the near future, Ethereum might hit the level at $3,927.66 by as early as June 30, 2024, according to the advanced AI algorithm deployed by the crypto monitoring and forecasting platform PricePredictions retrieved by Finbold on June 6.

Specifically, this would represent an increase of 2.12% from Ethereum’s price at press time provided that the prediction, which takes into consideration technical analysis (TA) indicators, such as relative strength index (RSI), Bollinger Bands (BB), moving average convergence divergence (MACD), and others, comes true.



Ethereum price analysis



For now, Ethereum is changing hands at the price of $3,846.08, which represents a 1.42% gain in the last 24 hours, an increase of 2.83% across the previous seven days while adding up to the 24.06% advance accumulated over the past month, as per the latest charts on June 6.

As a reminder, the $90 billion asset manager VanEck raised its 2030 ETH price target to $22,000, influenced by “ether ETF news, scaling progress, and our read of onchain data,” as well as the analysis of how ETH and Bitcoin (BTC) perform in both traditional and crypto-only portfolios for optimal returns.”







In addition to the AI’s positive short-term prognosis, VanEck’s optimism suggests an overall positive sentiment regarding Ethereum’s future. However, it is important to keep in mind that trends in the crypto industry can sometimes shift, so doing one’s own research is critical when investing.

Uniswap Whale Makes Waves, Dumping $7 Million Worth of UNI - Coin Edition


							

UNI crashed by 6% from the intraday high of  $11.26 to a low of $10.63 today.



The decline emerged after a whale dumped UNI worth $7.08 million. 



Another bearish factor for UNI is the upcoming unlock of over $90 million for advisors, teams, and investors




Over the last 24 hours, UNI, the native token of the Uniswap DEX, suffered a significant decline amid the Bitcoin-led crypto market rally. During yesterday’s brief surge, UNI reached a daily high of $11.26. However, UNI dropped to $10.63 earlier today, losing approximately 6% of its value.



Lookonchain, the crypto analytics firm, suggests that large-scale whale activity may have influenced Uniswap’s price crash. Lookonchain revealed that a major UNI investor sold 606,088 tokens, realizing a profit of $7.08 million. According to the firm, this substantial sale triggered UNI’s price drop earlier today.







Additionally, the analytics service reported that the whale had previously withdrawn 1.3 million UNI, valued at $13.7 million, from the Binance exchange. Currently, the whale holds 696,808 UNI, worth $7.46 million, across three wallets. Lookonchain estimated that this investor netted a profit of approximately $800,000 from their recent UNI sale.



Prior to the recent UNI token sale, the market tracker noted that this whale had purchased a total of $28.75 million worth of Ethereum ecosystem tokens from Binance in late May. These purchases included 858,069 UNI worth $8.7 million, 4.04 million LDO worth $9.3 million, 71,190 AAVE worth $7.4 million, 82,041 ENS tokens worth $2 million, and 250,969 FXS worth $1.25 million.While UNI’s price hovers around $10.77 at press time with limited signs of recovery, the asset has retained over 38% of its gains accrued in the last 30 days. Meanwhile, another bearish factor for UNI is the upcoming unlock of 8.33 million tokens, valued at over $90 million, from the Uniswap treasury for advisors, teams, and investors.

Nigel Farage milkshake’d while touring with shady crypto ally


A former aide to Nigel Farage, who was previously convicted of wire fraud and allegedly found to be the owner of an illegal crypto ATM, was apparently filmed alongside the far-right politician when he was ‘milkshake’d’ on Tuesday. 
Financier George Cottrell — also known as ‘Posh George’ — appeared to be among Farage’s entourage at the Reform Party’s campaign launch in Essex when a member of the crowd threw a milkshake at the former UK Independence Party (UKIP) leader. This was the second milkshake thrown in the politician’s face.
Cottrell was in his 20s when he took up a position as an unpaid advisor to Farage and began co-directing Brexit-related fundraising for UKIP. However, in July 2016 he was arrested and charged with 21 counts of conspiracy to commit money laundering, wire fraud, blackmail, and extortion.

An FBI sting operation caught Cottrell agreeing to launder £120,000 a month in drug trafficking proceeds. Cottrell allegedly threatened to report the fake drug traffickers to the police in an attempt to blackmail them out of 130 bitcoins, then worth $80,000.   
He subsequently negotiated a plea deal with US prosecutors that saw him plead guilty to one count of wire fraud while another 20 were dropped. He received an eight-month sentence and was released in March 2017.
In 2016 a UKIP spokesperson told the BBC, “George was an unpaid and enthusiastic volunteer for the party over the period of the referendum. 
“We are unaware of the details of the allegations excepting that they date from a time before he was directly involved in the party.”
George Cottrell allegedly owns illegal cryptomat 
In 2023, Montenegro’s finance minister accused the former Farage aide of illegally owning a cryptomat, a physical crypto trading outlet similar to a crypto ATM. In addition, politicians from the country’s ‘Movement for Change’ accused Cottrell of funding the political organization Evropa Now Movement (PES).
According to Montenegrin news outlet Vijesti, the country’s minister of finance said, “We know that there is no legal basis for the trading of cryptocurrencies in Montenegro and that everything related to possible trade through that [cryptomat] is illegal.” Lawyers representing Cottrell deny the accusations. 
Cottrell reportedly founded the ‘Private family office’ in Tivat, Montenegro, in 2020. His time in Montenegro was also hallmarked by his loss of £16 million in a Montenegro casino this year. 
It’s unclear what his role was on Farage’s recent campaign launch. However, Cottrell claims on LinkedIn that he continues to work with “financial institutions, politicians, and political consulting firms.”

Should FET, AGIX, and OCEAN Investors Worry About ASI?


Mergers between two companies in the crypto industry are rare. Still, it is even rarer to see three companies come together as Fetch.ai (FET), Ocean Protocol (OCEAN), and SingularityNET (AGIX) plan to.
Whether this will turn out to be a spectacular or a disastrous spectacle is yet to be determined.
The Artificial Superintelligence Alliance (ASI) Closer to Coming to Life
Earlier this week, SingularityNET announced that it would merge with Fetch.ai and Ocean Protocol to form the Artificial Superintelligence Alliance (ASI). The merger will unify the three networks into one Artificial Intelligence (AI) network.

Currently, these three tokens are worth around $3.2 billion combined. Following the merger, ASI is targeting a market cap of $7.5 billion, which would place the token among the top 20 cryptocurrencies in the world.
The merger is expected to begin on June 11 and be completed by June 13, after which the three tokens cease to exist. Token holders until June 13 will have a chance of swapping their holdings for ASI.
However, with a market cap target of 2x the current valuation of these three assets, the question arises if this is a possibility or a simple fantasy.
FET, AGIX, OCEAN Price Prediction: Where They Are and Where They Could Land
Fetch.ai (FET)
Fetch.ai’s price has been consolidating for the past two months, with every breakout attempt failing so far. FET is changing hands at $2.11, moving within the range of $1.95 and $2.49.
The Relative Strength Index (RSI) is in the bearish zone under the neutral line of 50.0. The RSI is a momentum oscillator that measures the speed and change of price movements. It currently signals a bearish outcome over the next week, likely keeping FET consolidated.

SingularityNET (AGIX)
AGIX price has been doing well on the macro time frame. The altcoin has observed a consistent uptrend for the past two months, bringing the trading price to $0.89. AGIX is currently sitting under the critical resistance of $1.00.
If this barrier is breached, the crypto asset would have a shot at rising further towards rallying beyond $1.07.

However, this could take a while, and the anticipated merger date, June 11, is less than a week away.
Ocean Protocol
OCEAN’s price action has not been too impressive, either. The altcoin has been consolidating between $0.84 and $1.02 for a solid eight weeks. OCEAN nearly breached the upper limit once but failed to sustain the rise, returning to the trading price of $0.89.

The chances of the altcoin dipping to test the support floor of $0.84 are much higher than a breakout.

Thus, given the current market conditions and despite the rise in AI, these three tokens are witnessing slow growth. The potential of these assets combining and skyrocketing from positions 60, 80, and 143 to become a top-20 asset seems a little difficult.

Senate Crypto Bill: Potential Impact on Digital Assets

This week, a bill placed on the Senate calendar introduces several provisions that could impact digital asset protocols and tokens. Although it does not explicitly ban digital asset protocols, its broad scope could allow it to become an attack vector for anti-crypto aspects of the US government.The Senate Select Committee on Intelligence passed the Intelligence Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2025 (IAA) by a unanimous 17-0 vote in May, as Senator Warner’s office reported. The bill, S. 4443, authorizes funding, provides legal authorities, and enhances congressional oversight for the US Intelligence Community (IC).Specifically, Section 423 of the bill allows the Secretary of the Treasury to impose sanctions prohibiting transactions between any US person and a “foreign digital asset transaction facilitator” who has knowingly facilitated significant transactions with foreign terrorist organizations, specially designated global terrorist organizations, or other sanctioned entities. The definition of “foreign digital asset transaction facilitator” is broad, covering any foreign person or group that “controls, operates, or makes available a digital asset protocol or similar facility, or otherwise materially assists in the purchase, sale, exchange, custody, or other transaction involving an exchange or transfer of value using digital assets.”While this does not constitute an outright ban, even protocols such as Aave, Uniswap, or stablecoins like USDT could potentially be designated as sanctioned “foreign digital asset transaction facilitators” if they are determined to have knowingly facilitated prohibited transactions with sanctioned entities. This could restrict US persons from transacting with them. However, the bill does not ban these protocols or tokens outright solely for being potentially accessible to sanctioned entities. There would need to be a determination that they knowingly facilitated prohibited transactions.“FOREIGN DIGITAL ASSET TRANSACTION FACILITATOR.—The term “foreign digital asset transaction facilitator” means any foreign person or group of foreign persons that, as determined by the Secretary, controls, operates, or makes available a digital asset protocol or similar facility, or otherwise materially assists in the purchase, sale, exchange, custody, or other transaction involving an exchange or transfer of value using digital assets.”Tether has frequently complied with requests to freeze tokens for US-sanctioned entities. Regardless, US institutions have repeatedly targeted it for allegedly allowing such activity, with competitor Circle adding to the rhetoric in front of Congress earlier this year. Aave, Uniswap, and others banned wallets that interacted with TornadoCash to comply with US sanctions in 2022. Still, if the Treasury deems previous interactions as “materially assisting” sanctioned entities, this new legislation could target them, in the worst-case scenario, the crypto industry.Given the bill’s importance and historical context, it is likely that some form of the Intelligence Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2025 will pass. However, the exact provisions, especially those related to digital assets and protocols, may be subject to changes during the legislative process. The bill’s progress and any amendments will need to be monitored to understand its final impact on open-source protocols and decentralized tokens.Per Senator Warner’s office, the bill has cleared a significant hurdle by being reported favorably by the Select Committee on Intelligence and placed on the Senate calendar for further consideration. This indicates strong support and a positive trajectory through the legislative process.Ultimately, the bill aims to enhance oversight and potential sanctions around digital assets but does not constitute an outright ban on major DeFi protocols or stablecoins at this point. Their operations could face restrictions if they are found to have facilitated prohibited transactions with sanctioned entities, necessitating careful compliance and fair treatment by regulatory authorities.Mentioned in this articleLatest Alpha Market Report

Kanter's Regulatory Response On AI Monopolies


                                U.S. Antitrust Chief to Scrutinize AI Sector for Monopoly Risks                                The United States antitrust chief Jonathan Kanter has declared the need to investigate the AI industry due to the alleged monopolization of the market. To avoid the domination of several companies, Kanter’s analysis will encompass several facets of AI such as computing capacity, data utilization, and hardware access.What’s the News?Jonathan Kanter, the U. S. antitrust enforcer has pointed out the fact that it is high time that regulators focused on the AI industry. During an interview, Kanter stressed the need to look into the competition and find monopoly choke points. These points include computing power for AI, data for training LLMs, cloud providers’ domination, engineering talent, and AI hardware.Kanter said that it is crucial to intervene early to address the problem of large technology companies monopolizing the AI market. He stated that the current status of AI competition is at its highest level and active steps are needed to sustain this level of competition. According to Kanter, if regulators intervene in real-time, they can be less intrusive to the companies as they can manage monopoly threats adequately.Impacts of AI MonopolyThe concentration of the AI industry is another factor that poses numerous questions. Another challenge is the limited availability of graphics processing units (GPUs) necessary for training LLMs. When people want to use these innovative products, they begin to focus on how chipmakers are distributing their chips. This is especially important to discuss as firms such as Nvidia record increased revenues and stock prices because of the high sales of their GPUs. The overall revenues in the first quarter of 2023 were recorded to be 262% higher than the same period of the previous year which took Nvidia’s valuation over $2.5 trillion.Furthermore, monopolies in AI can cause a more significant problem of power consolidation that kills the spirit of innovation and enhances social imparity. Recently Singularity NET’s Chief Operating Officer Janet Adams expressed her concerns about big tech companies taking over artificial general intelligence (AGI). Adams also points out that if the creation of AGI will be in the hands of several large companies the creation will be focused on making money and may not bring a positive impact on society and may lead to a dystopian future.Preventions to avoid the monopoly of AITo avoid monopolistic control in the AI sector the following steps can be taken. Kanter referred to the current government programs that have been put in place to help increase production like the Chips and Science Act of 2022. This legislation provides $39 billion of subsidies for chip manufacturing inside the United States, intending to strengthen the local supply chain and cut dependence on foreign manufacturers.Also, decentralizing the development of Artificial Intelligence through the use of blockchain technology could be a significant move. This would spread the advancements in AI among a larger number of players, and thus, the advantages of AI would be enjoyed by a larger number of people. Thus, regulators can encourage the creation of more open-source AI projects and support less experienced developers.ConclusionThus, constant monitoring of the AI sector and its activities is crucial as the sector grows rapidly. Jonathan Kanter’s approach of being aggressive in identifying potential monopolies in AI is good for ensuring that there is no monopolistic behavior in the market. Thus, the regulators should focus on eliminating the monopoly choke points and encouraging decentralization to guarantee that the AI advantages will be distributed and innovations will be encouraged. As per CoinGabbar, AI’s future is most likely to be shaped by these two poles to avoid monopolistic tendencies while encouraging technological development in the interest of humanity.Also Read: Bots On The Boats With AI, Is It Driving Humans?

How Bitcoin, Ethereum pushed crypto market cap to over $2 trillion - AMBCrypto



The crypto market capitalization has increased slightly in the last 24 hours.
BTC and ETH’s price increase contributed to the increase in the market cap.

The cryptocurrency market recently experienced a slight increase in market capitalization. This growth was largely driven by the prices of Bitcoin [BTC] and Ethereum [ETH], which dominate the market. 
Additionally, both assets have been experiencing significant accumulation volume recently.
Bitcoin, Ethereum contribute to market increase
According to data from CoinMarketCap, the cryptocurrency market’s market capitalization has increased by over 1% in the last 24 hours. 
Currently, the market cap stands at over $2.6 trillion. The analysis revealed that Bitcoin accounts for over 53% of the market cap, amounting to approximately $1.4 trillion, while Ethereum holds nearly 18%, valued at around $463 billion.
Source: CoinMarketCap
Further analysis revealed that the market capitalization increased by almost $1 trillion from the end of last month to now. 
At the end of May, the market cap was approximately $1.54 trillion. Currently, it stands at around $2.54 trillion, indicating an increase of nearly $1 trillion.
Bitcoin, Ethereum see increased accumulation
Recent analysis indicates an increase in the accumulation of Bitcoin and Ethereum over the past few days. This accumulation coincides with notable price movements, contributing to the rise in market capitalization.
According to data from CryptoQuant, the wallet reserves holding between 1,000 and 10,000 Bitcoins have been increasing.
These wallets now collectively hold over 3.6 million BTC, indicating substantial accumulation despite recent price fluctuations. 
Further analysis showed that this trend has been ongoing since March. Additionally, the wallets in the 1,000 BTC category now account for about 40% of the total Bitcoin supply.
Additionally, data indicates that Ethereum has been experiencing increased accumulation by large addresses. 
The chart reveals an upward trend in accumulation from wallets holding between 10,000 and 100,000 ETH. These addresses now hold over 340,000 ETH, valued at more than $1.3 billion.
Ethereum sees more holders than Bitcoin
Bitcoin and Ethereum have both experienced increased accumulation, but Ethereum currently has more holders. 
According to data from Santiment, the number of Ethereum holders has surged in recent years, reaching nearly 123 million. In contrast, the number of Bitcoin holders stands at around 54.2 million.
Source: Santiment
This indicates that the number of Ethereum holders is more than double that of Bitcoin holders. A major reason for this could be the cost of entry into these assets. 
Currently, Bitcoin’s value has increased again, with predictions of further rises in the future. 
This increase may drive more traders toward alternative assets like Ethereum and others, subsequently impacting the prices of these assets.
How ETH, BTC have trended in the last 24 hours
AMBCrypto’s daily analysis of Ethereum revealed a positive price movement on 5th June, with a 1.48% increase, bringing its price to around $3,866. 
Despite recent struggles, Ethereum has managed to stay within this price range. As of this writing, it is still trading in the $3,800 range, with a decline of less than 1%.
Source: TradingView
Additionally, an analysis of Ethereum’s Relative Strength Index (RSI) indicated that it remains in a strong bull trend. As of this writing, its RSI is above 65.
Analysis of the Bitcoin price trend showed positive bounces over the past few days. The chart indicated a five-day consecutive rise, taking its price from around $67,700 to over $71,000.

By the end of trading on 5th June, Bitcoin was trading at approximately $71,121, marking an increase of almost 1%. As of this writing, it has slightly declined to the $70,000 region, with a decrease of less than 1%.
According to its RSI, BTC remained in a bull trend despite the recent price decline. The RSI was above 60 as of this writing.

Is Bitcoin (BTC) Attempting to Push to a New All-Time High Next?


Bitcoin (BTC) currently trades within an ascending channel. The rally in the past few days has pushed the leading coin’s price toward the upper line of this channel.
If the coin successfully crosses above this line, it will have breached a key resistance level of $72,690.
Bitcoin “Big Boys” Weigh In
Bitcoin’s recent rally above $70,000 is partly due to the uptick in the coin’s whale activity over the past few weeks. 

On-chain data reveals a significant increase in the number of large daily transactions over the past 30 days. BTC transactions valued between $100,000 and $1 million have surged 9% during this period. 
Even more notable, transactions valued above $10 million have skyrocketed by 165% in the last month.
Bitcoin Whale Activity. Source: IntoTheBlock
Upticks like these in BTC transactions suggest increased participation from institutional investors, such as hedge funds, investment firms, and corporations, during the period under review. 
This attention from this cohort of BTC investors played out on June 4 when the US-based spot BTC ETFs recorded its 15 consecutive days of inflows, Bloomberg Intelligence senior ETF analyst Eric Balchunas noted in a post on X.

“The ability to bounce back w/ renewed interest after a couple nasty selloffs is rare for hot sauce type strategies. Shows staying power.” Balchunas added.

However, general market sentiment around the leading crypto continues to be negative. On-chain data showed that despite BTC’s recent price performance, its weighted sentiment has been negative since May 23. 

Also Read: Bitcoin Halving Cycles and Investment Strategies: What To Know
Bitcoin Weighted Sentiment. Source: Santiment
With a weighted sentiment of -0.3 when writing, there was more negative chatter than positive around BTC on social media.
BTC Price Prediction: Is Demand Losing Steam?
At press time, BTC’s Relative Strength Index (RSI) was in an uptrend. This indicator measures an asset price momentum. 

It oscillates between 0 and 100 and is used to identify overbought or oversold market conditions. At 64, the indicator’s value showed steady demand for BTC.
However, BTC’s declining Chaikin Money Flow (CMF) forms a bearish divergence that hints at a potential price dip. This indicator measures money flow into and out of an asset’s market.
When it declines when an asset’s price rises, a bearish divergence is formed. This divergence suggests that despite the rising price, buying pressure is decreasing, indicating a potential price decline.
Bitcoin Analysis. Source: TradingView

If this trend continues, and the CMF continues to record lower values, BTC may eventually retrace and slip back to $68,180.

However, if buying pressure regains momentum and spikes, it will push the coin’s price above resistance at $72,690.

Investment Company VanEck Targeted This Figure for Ethereum by 2030! Is it possible? Here are the Details - Bitcoin Sistemi

Global investment firm VanEck has set a new price target for Ethereum (ETH), predicting that the Ethereum network's native token will reach $22,000 by 2030.
VanEck Predicts Ethereum (ETH) to Reach $22,000 by 2030
This ambitious estimate represents a significant increase from current trading levels of approximately $3,850.


VanEck attributed this potential increase to Ethereum's disruptive capabilities and significant cash flow generation for token holders.
The firm emphasized that Ethereum has revolutionized various sectors such as finance, banking, payments, marketing, advertising, social media, gaming, infrastructure and artificial intelligence.





The report emphasized that Ethereum's technology offers lower costs, greater efficiency and greater transparency, which could shift significant market share from traditional financial and technology institutions to blockchain-based solutions.
VanEck estimates that this shift could tap into a total existing market (TAM) of $15 trillion.



Furthermore, VanEck predicts that free cash flows from holding Ethereum will reach $66 billion by 2030, further increasing its valuation to its projected target of $22,000.
The firm, which has filed to list an Ethereum exchange-traded fund (ETF), also predicts that these ETFs could surpass Bitcoin ETFs in size.





The report expressed confidence that spot Ethereum ETFs are nearing approval to trade on US exchanges.
Such approval would enable financial advisors and institutional investors to hold ether with the security of qualified custodians and benefit from the pricing and liquidity advantages characteristic of ETFs.

Robinhood Bets Big on Crypto with $200M Acquisition of Bitstamp


																Popular trading platform, Robinhood, has reached an agreement to acquire cryptocurrency exchange, Bitstamp. This purchase aims to bolster Robinhood’s presence in the crypto space across the world while simultaneously attracting institutional clients by offering new products.
The all-cash deal is valued at $200 million and is anticipated to be finalized in the first half of 2025.
According to the official press release, the deal’s completion is based on customary closing conditions, including obtaining necessary regulatory approvals. The acquisition is estimated to be finalized in the first half of 2025, provided all requirements are met.
Barclays Capital Inc. acted as the exclusive financial advisor to Robinhood throughout this transaction, while Galaxy Digital Partners LLC served as the exclusive financial advisor to Bitstamp.
Commenting on the development, Johann Kerbrat, General Manager of Robinhood Crypto, said,
“The acquisition of Bitstamp is a major step in growing our crypto business. Bitstamp’s highly trusted and long standing global exchange has shown resilience through market cycles. By seamlessly coupling customer experience with safety across geographies, the Bitstamp team has established one of the strongest reputations across retail and institutional crypto investors.”
As a result of the acquisition, the teams from Bitstamp and Robinhood will integrate, combining their expertise and resources.
This move is anticipated to facilitate Robinhood’s goal of expanding its global reach beyond the United States and attracting institutional clients to its platform. The US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) issued a Wells Notice to Robinhood, alleging potential violations of securities laws last month.
Despite the regulatory scrutiny in the country, Robinhood’s crypto revenue soared to $618 million, reflecting a 40% year-over-year increase.
In an effort to expand its crypto offerings, the platform launched crypto trading services for clients within the European Union in December.

Bitcoin and Other Crypto Assets on the Cusp of ‘Significant Move,’ Says Jason Pizzino - Here’s His Outlook - The Daily Hodl


								Cryptocurrency analyst and trader Jason Pizzino is offering his thoughts on the potential trajectory for the digital asset market going forward.
Pizzino tells his 328,000 YouTube subscribers that the Average True Range indicator is suggesting that “another significant move” is imminent for Bitcoin (BTC) and other crypto assets.










The ATR is used to measure the volatility of an asset with higher values indicating higher volatility and lower values indicating lower volatility.
According to Pizzino, Bitcoin recently witnessed a relatively small range and this could portend a bullish move ahead.
“Basically, we’ve seen one of the smallest days since January. So Bitcoin did a $500 range day on the weekend on Saturday… typically when this happens, you see some sort of windup period… you can see in each of these occasions you will see a pretty significant move to the upside.”
Source: Jason Pizzino/YouTube
The widely followed analyst says that Bitcoin is “still looking relatively good” and is well-placed for the “next leg to start”. According to Pizzino, Bitcoin needs to first undergo a consolidation phase before it can rise above the all-time high of $73,800 reached on March 14th.
“Does not mean that we’re going to blow up in a matter of days or weeks. But I think we could still take a bit of time here. Bitcoin’s price has got to consolidate above $72,000.”

Bitcoin is trading at $70,984 at time of writing.
Turning to altcoins, Pizzino says that the combined market cap of this class of crypto assets is currently in a phase similar to other periods that preceded a breakout.
“I see this as a stealth move for the altcoins. And the stronger ones are going to get the gains when this breaks out. So the theory here is we’re in stealth – the stealth is identified here with small average true ranges of the bars.”

Cardano's Growing Adoption Could Fuel Next Bull Run, Analyst Says


							

Dan Gambardello thinks Cardano’s ADA is preparing for a parabolic bull run.



Cardano Foundation partnered with Argentina, and Dubai police started using the technology.



Historical data suggest ADA is set to rally significantly.




Renowned crypto analyst Dan Gambardello believes Cardano’s ADA is gearing up for a parabolic bull run following recent developments in the project’s ecosystem.



In an X post, Gambardello highlighted the Cardano Foundation’s collaboration with Argentina and Dubai police utilizing the technology as significant catalysts for the blockchain project.







In addition to these events, Gambardello noted that the US is exploring the deployment of Cardano in voting processes. He believes these developments will collectively contribute to Cardano’s growth, ushering ADA into the new era of Voltaire, a community-run chain, as charts suggest a potential parabolic bull market.



Meanwhile, Gambardello shared an ADA monthly chart to illustrate how the altcoin’s historical trend supports his projection. The chart reveals that ADA is mirroring its 2019 to 2022 movement when it experienced a parabolic rally.



In 2019, ADA traded sideways for an extended period before breaking above a significant moving average. The surge began after the token retested the moving average ahead of the bull cycle, causing ADA to soar over 5,000% in its most significant rally.









Notably, ADA has replicated this trend, as Gambardello’s post demonstrates. The altcoin traded sideways before breaking above the same moving average. The current price action shows ADA retesting the moving average, prompting the analyst to project a move similar to the 2021 parabolic surge.



Gambardello’s projection isn’t solely based on technical indicators. He also cites the aforementioned efforts by the Cardano Foundation to increase adoption and the project’s expansion into new territories. Such developments, coupled with the favorable technical arrangements, could catalyze a significant surge for ADA in the upcoming bull cycle. ADA was trading at $0.458 at press time, according to TradingView data.

How Ethereum ETF Inflows Will Impact Bitcoin And Cryptocurrency Prices - Benzinga

Benzinga has investigated the impact of spot Ethereum ETFs on Bitcoin BTC/USD and Ethereum ETH/USD prices and potential size of inflows to provide investors with a better understanding of future market dynamics.Expected Inflows and Market DynamicsThe approval of spot Ethereum ETFs has already begun to shift investor sentiment positively. Data indicates that Ethereum saw a turnaround with net inflows following the SEC approval, breaking a 10-week streak of outflows that totaled $200 million.Inflows for Ethereum reached approximately $36 million recently, underscoring renewed investor interest​​.Will It Be New Capital?The influx of capital into Ethereum ETFs is expected to attract both retail and institutional investors, providing a regulated and secure means to invest in Ethereum. Analysts predict significant new capital flowing into these ETFs. For instance, Bloomberg Intelligence forecasts that the new Hong Kong crypto products, including Ethereum ETFs, could see about $1 billion in net inflows in their first year or two.Given the larger scale of the U.S. ETF market, the inflows for U.S.-based Ethereum ETFs could be substantially higher​.Also Read: Bitcoin Spot ETFs Record $887M Inflow On Wednesday, Second-Highest EverPotential Impact On BitcoinThere is a concern that the new capital flowing into Ethereum ETFs might cannibalize the inflows that would otherwise go into Bitcoin ETFs. However, the data suggests a more nuanced picture. Bitcoin ETFs have also seen strong inflows, with products like BlackRock's iShares Bitcoin Trust IBIT leading the way with $720 million in net inflows recently.This indicates robust investor appetite for both cryptocurrencies​.Price ImplicationsThe impact on prices will depend on the balance between new capital inflows and the potential shift from Bitcoin to Ethereum investments. If the inflows are primarily new capital, we could see upward pressure on both Bitcoin and Ethereum prices. Conversely, if there is significant cannibalization, Bitcoin might experience slower price appreciation relative to Ethereum.The upcoming Benzinga Future of Digital Assets event on Nov. 19 will be a key forum to discuss these developments.Industry leaders will offer their insights on the evolving dynamics of digital assets, providing valuable perspectives on how these ETF inflows might shape the market in the coming months.Read Next: Mike Novogratz Predicts Bitcoin To $100K By The End Of 2024Image: Shutterstock

G-III Apparel Group Beats Q1 Expectations with $0.12 EPS - Tokenist


					
Neither the author, Tim Fries, nor this website, The Tokenist, provide financial advice. Please consult our website policy prior to making financial decisions.



G-III Apparel Group, Ltd. (NASDAQ: GIII) reported a robust performance for the first quarter of fiscal 2025, which ended April 30, 2024. The company’s net sales were $609.7 million, a slight increase from $606.6 million in the same quarter last year. Net income significantly rose to $5.8 million, or $0.12 per diluted share, compared to $3.2 million, or $0.07 per diluted share, in the prior year’s quarter.



The company’s non-GAAP net income per diluted share remained steady at $0.12, as there were no non-GAAP adjustments during this period. Morris Goldfarb, G-III’s Chairman and CEO, attributed the strong start to fiscal 2025 to double-digit increases in DKNY and Karl Lagerfeld and a successful relaunch of Donna Karan. Goldfarb highlighted the company’s strategic investment in All We Wear Group (AWWG) to accelerate its European expansion.



Additionally, the amendment and extension of their ABL credit facility to $700 million, extending the maturity to 2029, further solidifies G-III’s financial position. With approximately $1 billion in cash and availability, the company is well-positioned to continue investing in its brands and infrastructure.



G-III Apparel Group Reports $0.12 EPS Against -$0.03 Expected



When comparing the current performance against expectations, G-III Apparel Group exceeded its earnings per share (EPS) projections. The expectations for the quarter were an EPS of -0.03, but the company delivered an EPS of $0.12 per diluted share. This notable performance was driven by strategic investments and a strong market response to their owned brands. Revenue expectations were set at $614.35 million. While the actual revenue of $609.7 million fell slightly short, the company’s overall financial health and strategic moves overshadowed this minor shortfall.



The increase in net income and EPS indicates effective cost management and successful brand investments. Despite the marginal miss on revenue expectations, the company’s ability to surpass EPS forecasts by a significant margin demonstrates strong operational efficiency. 





G-III Apparel Group Updates Full Year Outlook, Expects Net Sales of Approx. $3.2 Billion, EPS between $3.58 and $3.68



G-III Apparel Group has updated its fiscal 2025 outlook with cautious optimism. The company expects net sales of approximately $3.20 billion and net income between $170.0 million and $175.0 million, or between $3.58 and $3.68 per diluted share. This forecast compares to net sales of $3.10 billion and net income of $176.2 million, or $3.75 per diluted share, for fiscal 2024. The guidance reflects a balanced approach, considering incremental expenses associated with new product launches and marketing initiatives. For the second quarter of fiscal 2025, G-III anticipates net sales of approximately $650.0 million, compared to $659.8 million in the same period last year. Net income is expected to range between $10.0 million and $15.0 million, or $0.22 and $0.32 per share, compared to $16.4 million, or $0.35 per diluted share, in the previous year’s second quarter. The guidance takes into account the ongoing investments in marketing and technology to support brand expansion and operational capabilities.

Ciena Beats Q2 Forecasts, Reports Significant Drop in EPS Y/Y - Tokenist


					
Neither the author, Tim Fries, nor this website, The Tokenist, provide financial advice. Please consult our website policy prior to making financial decisions.



Ciena Corporation (NYSE: CIEN), a networking systems, services, and software company, announced its unaudited financial results for the fiscal second quarter ending April 27, 2024. The company reported revenue of $910.8 million, a decrease from $1.13 billion in the same quarter last year. The GAAP net loss for the quarter was $(16.8) million, or $(0.12) per diluted common share, compared to a net income of $57.7 million, or $0.38 per diluted common share, in the fiscal second quarter of 2023. Adjusted (non-GAAP) net income was $39.4 million, or $0.27 per diluted common share, down from $110.4 million, or $0.74 per diluted common share, in the previous year.



The company saw a decline in various segments, with the Networking Platforms segment experiencing a significant revenue drop from $914.9 million in Q2 FY 2023 to $676.3 million in Q2 FY 2024. Despite the challenging environment, Ciena’s Global Services segment grew, increasing revenue from $127.8 million to $134.7 million year-over-year. CEO Gary Smith emphasized the company’s focus on extending its leadership in optical networking to meet the growing demand for bandwidth.



Ciena’s Adjusted EPS Drops Significantly Y/Y But Outperforms Expectations at $0.27 per Share



When comparing Ciena’s current performance against market expectations, the company slightly exceeded revenue expectations but fell short on earnings per share (EPS). Analysts had projected revenue of $895.5 million and an EPS of $0.14. Ciena reported actual revenue of $910.8 million, surpassing the revenue forecast by approximately $15.3 million. However, the adjusted EPS of $0.27 was significantly higher than the expected $0.14, indicating better-than-expected cost management and operational efficiency.



Despite the revenue beat, the year-over-year revenue and profitability decline highlights Ciena’s ongoing challenges. The gross margin slightly decreased from 43.1% to 42.7% on a GAAP basis, and the operating margin turned negative at (0.4%) compared to 9.1% in the previous year. The adjusted operating margin also declined from 13.8% to 6.8%, reflecting the impact of lower sales and higher operating expenses.





Ciena Repurchased Approximately 1.1 Million Shares for $57 Million



Ciena provided guidance for the upcoming quarters, emphasizing a cautious yet optimistic outlook. The company expects continued robust growth in bandwidth demand, which it plans to leverage by focusing on its core strengths in optical networking. Management highlighted that service providers are still working through existing inventory, which has impacted short-term sales but is expected to normalize over time.



The company also noted several key metrics expected to influence future performance. Cash and investments totaled $1.42 billion, and cash flow from operations was $58.5 million for the quarter. These strong liquidity positions provide Ciena with the financial flexibility to invest in growth opportunities and navigate market uncertainties. Additionally, the company repurchased approximately 1.1 million shares of common stock for an aggregate price of $57.0 million, reflecting confidence in its long-term prospects.

Crypto expert PlanB drops bombshell Bitcoin prediction for June 2024


    After Bitcoin (BTC) has retaken the important psychological level at $71,000, the flagship decentralized finance (DeFi) asset seems to be moving towards the exceptionally bullish price target set by a renowned cryptocurrency analyst, who believes it might reach sooner rather than later.



Specifically, Bitcoin could hit the target price of “at least the $100,000 level we should see any time soon,” according to the analysis by pseudonymous crypto trading expert PlanB, who has shared his insights on the maiden crypto asset in a video streamed on his YouTube channel on June 1.

PlanB’s Bitcoin price prediction



Indeed, according to the crypto expert’s 200-week moving average (MA) chart, Bitcoin is looking at a price of $100,000 shortly, which coincides with his earlier shared stock-to-flow (S2F) model, which also sees the largest asset in the crypto sector by market capitalization rushing towards this high price mark.

Earlier in mid-May, PlanB argued that Bitcoin miner revenue tended to recover in two to five months after the halving, and after that, the price of Bitcoin “goes vertical.” As it happens, June 19 will mark two months since the last Bitcoin halving, so the vertical price action could occur shortly after that date.



Bitcoin price analysis



Currently, Bitcoin is changing hands at the price of $71,030, which suggests a modest increase of 0.12% in the last 24 hours while making more significant progress of 4.60% across the previous seven days, adding up to the advance of 11.50% over the past month, as per the latest chart data on June 6.

All things considered, Bitcoin could, indeed, hit a new all-time high (ATH) of $100,000 in the following weeks, as the crypto analyst has opined. However, things in the crypto market can sometimes change entirely, so doing one’s own research when investing is critical.

Vitalik Buterin slams celebrity memecoins, calls for "better direction" - AMBCrypto



Celebrities like Iggy Azalea launched memecoins, showcasing widespread crypto adoption among public figures.
Vitalik Buterin critiques celebrity memecoins, but community support remains strong.

In the year 2024, the trend of memecoins has gained considerable traction, with celebrities like Iggy Azalea, the American rapper, joining the fray by launching their own tokens, such as MOTHER IGGY on Solana [SOL]. 
Caitlyn Jenner, rappers Soul Ja Boy and Rich The Kid have also recently released their crypto tokens.
Buterin voices dissatisfaction!
However, Ethereum [ETH] co-founder Vitalik Buterin expressed discontent with the surge of celebrity-endorsed memecoins and emphasized the necessity for more relevant projects in the crypto sphere. 
In his recent X post, Buterin noted, 
“I’m feeling quite unhappy about with ‘this cycle’s celebrity experimentation’ so far. ‘Financialization as a means toward an end’, I can respect if the end is worthy (healthcare, open source software, art, etc).’” 
He further added, 
“Ashton and Mila’s Stoner Cats was vastly more honorable than anything we’ve seen from this 2024 celebrity memecoin era – at least there was an actual show being funded. How do we push things in a better direction?” 
Here, Buterin discusses “Stoner Cats,” a webcomic by Ashton Kutcher and Mila Kunis, lauded for its remarkable success in 2023. The SEC then charged the creators for an unregistered offering of NFTs. As per an SEC filling,  
“Stoner Cats sold its entire supply of NFTs in just 35 minutes, generating proceeds of over $8 million, most of which were then resold – not held as collectibles — in the secondary market within months.”
Buterin’s concerns regarding celebrities’ growing interest in memecoins raise a critical question: Is the future of cryptocurrency misdirected?
Buterin’s advice to scale celebrity-backed memecoins
In response, the Ethereum co-founder recommended various strategies to enhance celebrity-backed crypto ventures, focusing on public benefit, engaging content, and project sustainability. He suggested,

Memecoin craze despite crictsism
On the community front, reactions appear largely supportive of memecoins, as observed by researcher Gumshoe in their recent X post. 
“Iggy went from being called a scammer to having Vitalik and Ethereum OGs discussing the celebrity memecoin meta in a week. Pretty amazing if you ask me.” 
Despite Buterin’s expressed concerns about memecoins, which stemmed from a tweet by Chris Burniske, Mother Iggy experienced a notable 40% surge in the past 24 hours, while Ethereum saw a more modest increase of 1.16% at the time of writing.
All in all, ‘Aden | The Wolf of X’ put it best when he said, 
“#Memecoin season 2024 unstoppable.”

Shiba Inu's 2024 Roadmap: Team Member Outlines Key Developments So Far | Bitcoinist.com


								In a detailed update, Lucie, a well-known member of the Shiba Inu team and marketing head has outlined several key developments and achievements for the project in 2024. The successful introduction of Shibarium, Shiba Inu’s ground-breaking layer-2 blockchain solution intended to improve scalability and transaction efficiency, was one of Lucie’s many highlights of the noteworthy progress accomplished thus far.
These advancements highlight Shiba Inu’s continuous dedication to expansion and innovation, setting the project up for long-term success in the rapidly changing cryptocurrency market.
Major Developments For Shiba Inu In 2024
Shiba Inu team member, Lucie started with the Shibarium blockchain solution. Lucie noted that since the solution was introduced it has advanced significantly, improving the scalability and efficiency of the Shiba ecosystem.

Launched in August 2023, the blockchain marked a significant step for the project’s ecosystem, attracting millions of users during its first few weeks. Shibarium aims at tackling scalability, which was one of the main issues facing the Shiba Inu ecosystem. 
With a sharp reduction in transaction prices, Shibarium seeks to ease customers’ long-standing complaints about Ethereum’s high gas expenses. This presents a positive image, suggesting that Shibarium may establish Shiba Inu as a strong challenger for DeFi.
SHIBdentity is the next development pointed out by the marketing lead. The team introduced the initiative to usher in a new era of digital identity. It aims at giving users full control of their digital identity by employing valid credentials that can be verified and trustworthy authentification. 
Moreover, it provides real-time communication, spam reduction, and private peer-to-peer chat. In order to provide human-readable names and foster friendly messaging, SHIBdentity will need to communicate with Shib Name Service (SNS).
The next key development is the introduction of Shiba Inu’s SHEboshis Non-Fungible Tokens (NFT) collections. For those interested in NFTs, these collections pave the way for the development of hybrid tokens that provide shared ownership and uniqueness.
SHEboshi collections consist of 20,000 unique arts, launched as a DN404/ERC-404 token on the Ethereum network. It is important to note that SHEboshis, which embodies creativity, art, and the spirit of the SHIB community, marks a bold step into the future.
Upcoming Layer 3 Blockchain
Lucie also underscored the project’s much-anticipated Privacy-Focused Layer 3 Blockchain Development. This layer 3 blockchain intends to improve user privacy by enabling computations on encrypted data without the need for decryption.

So far, the team has managed to raise $12 million in funding to develop the blockchain. As part of the investment round, the yet-to-be-released TREAT was sold to a group of venture capital firms that included Animoca Brands, Polygon Ventures, Big Brain Holdings, and Shima Capital, among others.
Lucie further emphasized that Shiba Inu’s attendance at the Token2049 conference in Dubai was another significant achievement for the project this year. Midway through April, Shiba Inu took part in the event as a gold sponsor.
Lastly, the marketing lead underlined the integration of ShibaSwap, the native decentralized exchange (DEX) of the Shiba Inu ecosystem on the Shibarium blockchain. A key component of this integration is to improve the capacity of users to directly impact the ecosystem of the solution by generating new liquidity pools for the tokens they desire.

Avalanche strengthens the security of its native wallet

The cryptographic ecosystem of Avalanche is looking to increase the security of its infrastructure by implementing external web3 solutions.
Today Core, the native wallet of Avalanche developed by Ava Labs, announced a strategic partnership with the provider Blockaid, which provides a suite of tools to simulate transactions before their actual execution and avoid cyber scams such as phishing and hack.
Security is a very important topic within the crypto sector, where from 2017 to today hacking activities have been carried out for a total damage of 8.2 billion dollars.
Let’s see everything in detail below.

Avalanche Core forms a partnership with Blockaid to prevent phishing and hacks within its ecosystem
Today Core, the famous Avalanche cryptocurrency wallet developed by the parent company Ava Labs, revealed an integration with the Israeli provider of web3 security solutions Blockaid, with the aim of making its infrastructures impenetrable and offering users a convenient tool that highlights the presence of danger factors.
In detail, Blockaid uses highly sophisticated technology that allows transactions to be simulated before being executed by the user, enabling the identification and prevention of potential fraudulent activities such as phishing attacks, address poisoning, and hacks.
One of the biggest current limitations of decentralized non-custodial wallets is that when performing any operation (signature, approve spending, execution, etc.), it is not intuitively clear what is being confirmed, unless the underlying code is examined.
It often happens that several individuals are scammed precisely because they end up on malicious sites that invite them to connect their wallet and approve seemingly legitimate transactions, but which then end up emptying all the funds contained within: see case Ledger Connect Kit.
Blockaid solves this problem thanks to its warning interface that allows examining each step in real-time by leveraging the extensive database of web3 threats possessed by the Israeli security company.
This service has been integrated in the past also by other similar web3 providers to Avalanche Core like Coinbase wallet and Metamask, helping various communities to keep up with the advancement and refinement of cyber scams.
The integration of Blockaid with one of the main infrastructures of Avalanche addresses the needs of the DeFi sector, which from 20217 to today has seen 8.2 billion dollars lost due to hacks and exploits. More recently, in April 2023, about 53 million dollars were stolen from various types of attacks.
The solution just integrated on Avalanche Core, in the past has helped other ecosystems to protect approximately 7.1 billion dollars, warning of potentially malicious operations for 500 million dollars.

Regarding the excellent news, Akash Gupta, Head of Consumer Products at Ava Labs, the company that oversees the development of the Avalanche ecosystem, stated the following:
“This collaboration with Blockaid represents a significant step forward in providing users with security and control without compromising speed and ease of use. By integrating advanced security solutions into the Core suite, we ensure that users can explore the Avalanche ecosystem and beyond with complete peace of mind.”
Promoting high security and privacy standards within the decentralized finance industry is essential in order to move on to new onboarding challenges and truly aim for mass adoption. 
Avalanche is doing it the right way.
Other web3 tools focused on security and privacy
In addition to Blockaid, there are many other tools focused on the security and privacy of web3 transactions, which can be used by users of Avalanche and other ecosystems.
The most well-known is definitely Wallet Guard, an open-source extension for Chrome, iOS, and Brave that guides the end user through all cryptographic operations, providing pop-ups that explain what is being authorized when confirming a smart contract.
Wallet Guard, which also features a convenient security dashboard, has protected over 40 million dollars from scam activities, thanks to its timely alerts regarding potential frauds and hack.

Another very interesting service is that of Blowfish, available on Solana and on 14 EVM networks like Avalanche, Ethereum, Arbitrum, Base, which thanks to its interface warns users who are visiting fraudulent web3 sites.
Blowfish also warns if it perceives that the content of a tx being signed appears dangerous and explains what is being authorized when signing each smart contract and which funds will be used.

In order to safeguard one’s digital finances, the website Revoke.Cash is a must, which allows users to simply remove, through a unified dashboard, all previously signed token spending approvals, avoiding potential complications in case of a platform hack.
It often happens that when using a DEX and you have to approve the spending of a token, the authorization is not canceled at the end of the operation, leaving an attack vector for scammers and hackers.
Revoke works on over 80 decentralized networks, including Avalanche.

Among the other useful services in terms of web3 security, capable of preventing cyber attacks and saving our finances, we find Stelo, TrustCheck, Fire, Pocket Universe, AegisWeb3, and Web3 Antivirus.

Cardano’s (ADA) Future: Investors’ Decisions Are Crucial


Cardano’s (ADA) price is not reaping the benefits of the broader market cues as it remains sideways bound.
The reason is that no one other than the ADA whales opted to sell, creating a bearish atmosphere.
Cardano Whales Selling Sends Bearish Ripples

Cardano’s price has been influenced by its investors in the past, and this influence has only grown stronger now. The best example is the recent move from ADA whales, which the altcoin can still not recover from.
Addresses holding between 10 million and 100 million ADA sold over 290 million ADA in a single day at the end of May. This $130 million worth of supply could likely have been to either secure gains or prevent further losses.
Regardless, since such large wallet holders’ selling and buying affect the direction of the price action, it wasn’t surprising that ADA consolidated following the selling.

However, this could change, and the investors who caused the dip also have the power to do so. At the time of writing, the addresses conducting transactions on the network have registered a surge.
Cardano’s growing participation is a positive sign for the asset, which translates to increased demand and higher liquidity. However, the mixed cues generated could lead to consolidation. Plus, rising participation combined with falling prices or slow growth creates a deviation between the two.

This deviation tends to flash a sell single, which causes further issues with the price action.
ADA Price Prediction: Breakout Will Be a While Away
Cardano’s price moved within a symmetrical triangle for two months. A symmetrical triangle is a chart pattern characterized by converging trendlines connecting a series of sequential peaks and troughs. 

This pattern typically indicates a period of consolidation before the price breaks out in the direction of the existing trend. While the outcome is likely bullish, this would warrant further sideways movement before something substantial. This would require ADA first to secure the $0.46 as a support floor.

Considering the aforementioned factors, bearish-neutral price action will likely continue its sideways movement.
However, if $0.46 is tested as a support floor, the bearish thesis could be invalidated. As a result, ADA could also rise to $0.50 and above, effectively eliminating all recent losses.

It’s time to end the SEC's war on crypto - Blockworks


The American government is badly damaged — we need public servants who care more about right or wrong, especially when it comes to the crypto industry.
I’m not denying that there are reasonable questions about how crypto firms should be regulated. Many policy questions still require legislation to resolve. But, our current system is broken.
The Securities and Exchange Commission traditionally does not expose itself and its credibility to an appellate beatdown. But this SEC is different. This SEC and Chair Gary Gensler have an extra-regulatory anti-crypto agenda. And they are using their power to obstruct and delay the industry — imposing their own preferences where they can. 
Gensler may not like bitcoin. But whether you decide to invest in bitcoin is up to you, not the SEC. 
What’s going on with Gensler at the SEC is clearly a culture of bad faith against crypto.  
Take January’s approval of spot bitcoin ETFs, which only came after years of good-faith applications from crypto industry participants. The SEC was helpless to explain or defend its decision to reject past spot bitcoin ETFs — not a leg to stand on, it was truly an embarrassment. The court then ruled that the SEC position was “arbitrary and capricious.” And ultimately, Chair Gensler was forced to vote to approve a bitcoin ETF he was hell-bent to obstruct.  
Bitcoin ETFs from firms like BlackRock, Fidelity and Franklin Templeton provide a safe and easy way for US investors to buy bitcoin. They easily satisfy the SEC’s investor protection standards; they are in the best interest of the investors the SEC is sworn to protect. And three months after their launch, bitcoin ETFs hold $61 billion in assets.  
Or, take the recent SEC vs DEBT Box fiasco. Two SEC lawyers leading an anti-crypto action were forced to resign after a federal judge sanctioned the agency for “gross abuse of power.”
The SEC misled the court to get a temporary restraining order against crypto firm DEBT Box. This action was ex parte — without any notice to DEBT Box. They violated the court’s trust.
Forced to resign? After that debacle, the SEC should have turned off the lawyers’ key cards before they got back to the office. But maybe they were following marching orders. 
Where do we go from here?
This lack of communication between regulators and crypto participants has been going on for years, and needs to change. Many other issues in crypto could be navigated in good faith if regulators simply engaged with the industry. 
Back in 2021, Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong found that the SEC was the only government branch unwilling to meet with the firm. Coinbase is a public company. And it is now in litigation with the SEC relating to questions that could have been discussed and resolved in good faith back in 2021. 
But good faith left the building when Gary Gensler walked in. 
For example, take now the public spectacle of Gensler in front of Congress in April 2023, when he evaded the fundamental question of whether crypto’s second largest asset, ETH, is a security. Documents in the Consensys lawsuit against the SEC describe how the agency was pursuing an investigation into the nature of ETH days before Gensler testified.
Frustrating.  
“Chair Gensler refused to answer questions regarding the SEC’s classification of ether,” Rep. Patrick McHenry (R-NC) said on X. “New court filings show this was an intentional attempt to misrepresent the commission’s position.”  
Ethereum, established in 2015, has a market value of $457 billion. We should have a public statement from the SEC on this one. And to add to the federal regulatory charade, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission went to court this year claiming Ethereum is a commodity and not a security for the purpose of federal regulation. Do these guys talk to each other? 
If the SEC thinks Ethereum is a security, why not just say it? That’s an important question. If you are not steeped in crypto, you may struggle to answer it. But regulatory clarity unlocks the potential of the industry. And Gensler does not want that to happen. He has an agenda unrelated to his job as a regulator, and he is backed by Senator Elizabeth Warren, founder of the “anti-crypto army,” the world’s smallest and most unpopular political unit. 
Why should we care about crypto? 
Here’s why: Crypto is a disruptive transition of the kind this country normally leads and dominates. Capital and talent are gravitating to the industry. 
Crypto orchestrates the deployment of capital to overcome seemingly insurmountable barriers to entry. Look at how the US dollar stablecoin — the digital version of the US dollar with over $140 billion in circulation — is disrupting banking and payments. And incidentally, fostering the globalization of the dollar to the benefit of all Americans. 
We need a good faith regulator to get in the room with the adults in the crypto industry. We need to move past untethered regulatory obstruction. Goodbye Gary Gensler, hello honest reform.

Binance Restarted Cryptocurrency Partnership with Mastercard and Visa! Here are the Details... - Bitcoin Sistemi


According to Coindesk news, Binance, the world's largest cryptocurrency exchange, has reactivated Mastercard payments for cryptocurrencies.
Binance also announced that its Binance-branded Visa card continues to accept crypto payments.


Accordingly, MasterCard will continue its cryptocurrency deposit and payment services at Binance.
A Binance spokesperson told Coindesk:






“After a thorough review of the stringent controls and processes Binance has put in place, Mastercard has made the decision to allow Binance-related purchases on its network.
We look forward to adding support for other products, such as withdrawals, at a later date.
Apart from Mastercard, the Binance-branded Visa card has also resumed functionality on the exchange, in addition to allowing payments using Mastercard.”

Mastercard and Visa ended their card partnership with Binance, the world's largest cryptocurrency exchange, last August.
While it was stated that Binance's problems with regulators around the world were behind these moves by Mastercard and Visa, a Binance spokesperson told Bloomberg that Visa stopped issuing new cards co-branded with Binance in Europe as of July.

Roger Ver released on $160K bail as US seeks extradition


Roger Ver, a.k.a. ‘Bitcoin Jesus,’ was ordered to give up his passport and released on bail by Spanish authorities as the US seeks his extradition over tax fraud charges.  
That’s according to documents seen by Bloomberg that reveal his €150,000 ($163,000) bail, which began on May 17, was granted on the condition that he stay in Spain. 
Ver is also required to visit a Spanish court every two days. Prosecutors attempted to appeal his release but this was rejected. 
The bitcoin investor was arrested in late April after the US accused him of defrauding the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) out of more than $48 million. Just days before his arrest, Ver published his new book Hijacking Bitcoin, which is his own version of Bitcoin’s 2015-2017 blocksize wars.

Ver, who owned companies MemoryDealers.com Inc. and Agilestar.com Inc., started buying up bitcoin for himself and his firms, publicizing the purchases and earning his famous nickname.
The IRS alleges, that he ‘concealed and provided false information to his various advisors regarding the number and value of bitcoins he owned and controlled both personally and through his companies.’
Bloomberg reports that Ver’s lawyer, Jaime Campaner, claimed he “is not a fugitive at all, since he has been in touch with the US authorities through his Californian lawyers.” 
“Therefore, he was aware of the investigation and, in my opinion, his arrest didn’t make sense,” he said.
