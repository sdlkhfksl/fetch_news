Wintermute CEO questions Ethereum's leadership paradox amid celebrity memecoin controversy - Crypto Briefing


            
            
                            
            
                            
            
            Evgeny Gaevoy, CEO of Wintermute, said if Ethereum fails in the future, it will not be because of technical shortcomings compared to competitors like Solana. Instead, the core issue is the contradiction in Ethereum’s leadership.“If ETH fails in the future it [won’t] be because ‘Solana is faster’, it will be because the [ETH] ‘elite’ is still stuck in a massive contradiction,” Gaevoy stated in a recent post on X.His remarks come as a response to the controversy that erupted following Vitalik Buterin’s critique of celebrity memecoins. According to Buterin, projects should aim to deliver societal value and leave participants content, rather than focus on enriching celebrities and early investors.Buterin’s stance drew a sharp rebuke from hip-hop artist Iggy Azalea, who recently launched her own memecoin, MOTHER. She posted a meme showing her holding a baby that resembled Buterin.Azalea’s photo prompted Uniswap Labs co-founder Hayden Adams to defend Buterin’s role.He criticized Azalea for downplaying Buterin’s contributions to the crypto community, expressing disappointment that instead of reacting positively and using profits to support social causes, the singer chose to mock Buterin.That was when the Wintermute CEO jumped into the debate and criticized Ethereum’s leadership. He argued that Ethereum leaders are attempting to create a capitalist blockchain system while simultaneously addressing social issues—a stance he sees as inherently contradictory.“You are either building capitalism or planned socialism. I’m sorry, you really [can’t] have both,” Gaevoy added.Gaevoy’s comments sparked controversy among crypto members. Many disagreed with his view, saying that being against celeb memecoins does not equate to building a socialist system.In response to these disagreements, Gaevoy said it all came down to the underlying principle.According to him, if capitalism is the foundation, integrating features to mitigate its negative impacts is beneficial. However, if the primary goal is “social justice” or creating “only good things,” capitalism should not be an afterthought.

Real-World Asset Tokenization Tops Crypto Sector Performance


Real-world asset (RWA) tokenization has become the top-performing crypto sector, outperforming major sectors like Ethereum (ETH) and Bitcoin (BTC).
Significant developments, including high-profile asset tokenizations and positive regulatory discussions, drive this surge. It also highlights the sector’s growing potential and importance in the financial industry.
High-Profile Use Cases and Regulations Boost the RWA Tokenization Sector

According to data from the crypto analytics platform Artemis Terminal, real-world asset tokenization was the best-performing crypto sector last month, with a 58% performance compared to the other 21 sectors. Ethereum and Bitcoin ecosystems followed, with 26.1% and 18.2% performance, respectively.

RWA tokenization has seen significant growth recently, driven by key developments in the sector. On June 4, Galaxy Digital issued a multimillion-dollar loan secured by a 316-year-old Stradivarius violin.

The loan uses the Stradivarius violin and its digital representation as a non-fungible token (NFT) as collateral. This strategy ensures strong security for Galaxy Digital while providing asset management flexibility. The physical violin remains under custodianship in Hong Kong, with stringent requirements for its removal.
On the same day, Watford Football Club (Watford FC) also initiated a digital equity sale. Partnering with digital investment platform Republic, the sale offers approximately 10% of its shares. This equity sale will be available on Republic’s platform and Seedrs, its European counterpart.
Additionally, regulatory developments supported the sector. On June 7, the US Financial Services Committee held a hearing titled “Next Generation Infrastructure: How Tokenization of Real-World Assets Will Facilitate Efficient Markets.” The hearing assessed the need for more regulations to support tokenizing real-world assets and derivative products.
Notable industry figures participated in the hearing. Carlos Domingo, Co-founder and CEO of Securitize, and Robert Morgan, CEO of the USDF Consortium, represented the real-world asset tokenization industry. Lilya Tessler, Partner at Sidley Austin LLP, and Nadine Chakar, Global Head of Digital Assets at the Depository Trust and Clearing Corporation, contributed from the financial markets sector. Meanwhile, Prof. Hilary Allen from the American University Washington College of Law provided an academic perspective.
Despite varied perspectives from witnesses and lawmakers, the hearing highlighted the ongoing debate about blockchain technology in traditional finance. Regulatory clarity from such discussions could pave the way for broader adoption of tokenization.
The long-term industry outlook remains positive. BlackRock CEO Larry Fink has expressed optimism about tokenization.
He noted its ability to enable customized strategies and instantaneous settlement of bonds and stocks. According to Fink, these abilities can significantly reduce settlement costs.

Jenny Johnson, Franklin Templeton CEO, also highlighted the transformative potential of tokenizing real-world assets. She cited examples such as Rihanna’s NFT royalties and loyalty programs at St. Regis in Aspen.

“It’s this combination of loyalty programs with real-world assets, and I think that you’re going to see more and more companies do this combination. It’s simply that the technology is enabling you to do it,” she opined.

Furthermore, Johnson noted that tokenizing assets, like Franklin Templeton’s tokenized money market fund, offers lower entry points and operational costs, making professional asset management more accessible to younger investors. She believes holding investments in a digital wallet can encourage younger people to save for retirement by allowing smaller, more manageable investments.

Overall, Johnson envisions traditional finance institutions increasingly leveraging blockchain technology. This integration into mainstream investment practices aims to foster greater financial inclusion and encourage savings habits among younger generations.

ChatGPT Analyzes if Brett (BRETT) Can Flip Pepe (PEPE) in 2024


																TL;DR

BRETT, a frog-themed meme coin, has surged nearly 400% in the past month, reaching a market cap of $1.7 billion.
Analysts and ChatGPT believe it could surpass PEPE if current trends continue.


BRETT’s Chances
The cryptocurrency market jumped in the middle of the week, with the meme coin sector significantly contributing to that uptrend. Numerous assets of that type are well in the green on a seven-day scale, while the cohort’s market capitalization neared the $70 billion mark before it dropped to $61 billion after the Friday crash.
One such token that has become crypto’s rock star in the past few weeks is the frog-themed Brett (BRETT). Its value is up almost 400% on a monthly basis, recently reaching an all-time high of $0.17 (per CoinGecko’s data).
BRETT Price, Source: CoinGecko
BRETT’s market cap surged to a whopping $1.7 billion, making it the 69th-largest cryptocurrency and the seventh-largest in its realm. As such, we asked ChatGPT whether its uptick will continue in the near future and if it can surpass the leading frog-themed meme coin Pepe (PEPE).
The popular AI-powered chatbot estimated that a flippening is possible, assuming certain factors are in place. It noted that BRETT is the top meme coin of the Base chain, which is supported by the crypto exchange Coinbase. 




“BRETT’s association with the Base chain and its growing community support make it a strong contender to flip PEPE, especially in a bullish market scenario,” ChatGPT added.
The chatbot predicted a further price increase for the meme coin should it gain additional support from exchanges. KuCoin, Bitget, BitMart, and Uphold are some of the companies that have already allowed trading services with BRETT.
One analyst who believes that a Binance listing is in the cards is the X user Mac. In their view, the largest crypto exchange could jump on the bandwagon if BRETT’s trading volume keeps up its levels.
Despite its impressive performance, the asset’s market capitalization is still far from the one of its rival. PEPE’s market cap briefly pumped above $7 billion at the end of May before retracing to its current level of approximately $5.1 billion.
Is $1 Incoming?
BRETT’s spike caught the eye of numerous analysts, some of whom think the bull run is far from over. Crypto Rover, a popular X user with over 700,000 followers, claimed the uptrend “will not stop anytime soon,” envisioning $1 as the next price target.
Crash was bullish, too, reminding about PEPE’s market cap ascent from $300 million to over $7 billion. “Now watch BRETT do it,” they argued.

This Week's Best and Worst Altcoin Performers Revealed as BTC Stalls Above $69K (Weekend Watch)


																As it keeps happening during the past several weekends, bitcoin’s price action is quite dull and the asset has failed to make a big move out of its $69,300 position.
The landscape with the altcoins is quite different, though, as many of them are in the red on a daily and even on a weekly scale.
BTC Stalls at $69K
Perhaps driven by the impressive spot ETF inflows, bitcoin’s business week was quite optimistic. The asset entered Monday at around $67,500 but quickly started to climb and jumped above $70,000 by the end of the day.
It failed to conquer that level at first, but the bulls kept the pressure on, and BTC skyrocketed to $71,500 on Wednesday. Another leg-up followed on Friday that resulted in tapping $72,000 for the first time in over two weeks.
This is where the landscape changed for the worse. The bears intercepted the move and drove bitcoin south hard. In a matter of hours, the cryptocurrency had lost more than three grand and fell to $68,500.


Thanks for subscribing, you will get your first report in the next hours!


It managed to bounce off on Saturday morning and rise above $69,000. Since then, the price movements have been quite sluggish and the asset remains at around $69,300. Its market cap stands still at $1.365 trillion, but its dominance over the alts has jumped to 51.2% on CG.
Bitcoin/Price/Chart 09.06.2024. Source: TradingView
Alts See Red
The growing BTC dominance means that most alts have retraced in the past 24 hours. Toncoin is among the poorest performers as it has dropped by over 6% and sits well below $7. Substantial losses are evident from SOL, XRP, DOGE, SHIB, AVAX, DOR, BCH, and NEAR.
The meme coins have felt some of their inevitable volatility as PEPE has dumped by 6% and WIF is down by more than 5%.
The weekly landscape is quite different for some. BNB, which marked a new all-time high above $715 earlier, is up by 12% and trades close to $680. TON is actually in the green (9%), while SHIB (-8%), DOGE (-8.5%), AVAX (-10%), LINK (-13%), and DOT (-10%), and NEAR (-11%) are deep in the red.
The biggest gainers in the past seven days are BRETT (60%), ORDI (22%), and STX (23%). In contrast, BEAM (-22%), TIA (-20%), and LDO (-20%) have lost the most value.
The total crypto market cap is down by 0.6% in a day to $2.670 trillion.

Arthur Hayes Says Central Banks About To Catapult Bitcoin and Altcoins to New Heights - Here’s Why - The Daily Hodl


								BitMEX co-founder Arthur Hayes says that a shift in policy from the central banks is about to boost crypto assets into a new bullish phase.
In a new essay, Hayes, now the CIO of crypto investment fund Maelstrom, notes that both the Bank of Canada (BOC) and the European Central Bank (ECB) have decided to lower interest rates.










Hayes says the moves by Europe and Canada suggest that a global shift in looser monetary policy may be underway, and could therefore signal a bump in risk assets once the Federal Reserve in the US follows suit.
“The June central banking fireworks kicked off this week by the BOC and ECB rate cuts will catapult crypto out of the northern hemispheric summer doldrums. This was not my expected base case. I thought the fireworks would start in August, right around when the Fed hosts its Jackson Hole symposium. That is typically the venue where abrupt policy changes are announced going into autumn.
The trend is clear. Central banks at the margin are starting easing cycles.”
Source: NDR/Arthur Hayes
According to Hayes, the new chapter of monetary policy means it’s time to “go long Bitcoin and subsequently sh*tcoins.”
Says the crypto veteran,
“The macro landscape has changed vs. my baseline. Therefore, my strategy shall change as well. For the Maelstrom portfolio projects, who asked for my opinion on whether to launch their tokens now or later. I say, Let’s F***ing Go!
For my excess liquid crypto synthetic-dollar cash, a.k.a. Ethena’s USD (USDe) that’s earning some phat APYs (annual percentage yields), it is time to deploy it again on conviction shitcoins. Of course, I’ll tell readers what those are after I have purchased them. But suffice it to say, the crypto bull is reawakening and is about to gore the hides of profligate central bankers.”

Ethereum’s rally halts: Examining ETH's potential next moves - AMBCrypto



Ethereum’s current decline signaled a cooling-off from its recent highs
Derivative data pointed to continued market interest.

Ethereum [ETH] seems to have come off its ETF hype-induced rally as bulls have started to take a hike.
 At press time, the largest altcoin in the world has seen a decrease of 3.7% over the past day and 2.5% over the past week as the market awaits the approval of the S-1 forms for the ETFs. So, is the rally over already?
AMBCrypto’s analysis of TradingView saw that Ethereum has been unable to maintain its highs and is now consolidating at lower levels. 
The Moving Averages (MA50 in blue and MA200 in red) indicated a cooling-off period.
Source: TradingView
Initially, the price surged above both moving averages in a strong bullish move but has since declined and is now trading below these key indicators, as we see a shift to bearish momentum in the short term. 
The RSI, sitting around 45, also indicated a lack of strong buying momentum, with values leaning more toward the oversold territory, but not conclusively so.
Source: Santiment
Ethereum’s social volume has also declined significantly, suggesting that public interest in and sentiment toward the altcoin are low. 
This reduction in social engagement could be contributing to the decrease in Ethereum’s price, as less discussion might correlate with reduced trading activity and demand.
Source: Coinglass
Interestingly, the trading volume of Ethereum’s derivatives market has sharply increased by over 70%, meaning there is heightened market engagement.
Notably, the long/short ratio across different platforms also shows more bullish sentiment on platforms like Binance [BNB] and OKX.
Source: IntoTheBlock
What Ethereum’s future holds
The on-chain data for Ethereum presented a predominantly bullish scenario. 89% of holders are currently making money at the present price, indicating a strong upward trend that has benefited the majority. 

Read Ethereum’s [ETH] Price Prediction 2024-25

The significant concentration of the token by large holders (51%) suggested that while there was potential for high volatility due to possible large-scale sell-offs, the market was stable, with these major holders likely maintaining their positions.
Overall, Ethereum bulls seem to be cooling off temporarily, likely due to the latest US jobs data. But the rally is not over yet.

Crypto horoscope from June 10 to 16

New week, new crypto horoscope dedicated to the upcoming week from June 10 to 16.
This week will be characterized by the transit of the First Quarter Moon in Virgo on Friday 14/6.
For several months now, we have been dedicating space to the crypto horoscope written by Stefania Stimolo, an expert in astrology and blockchain. It is a weekly column with the horoscope of each zodiac sign available every Sunday only on The Cryptonomist. 
In our slogan of “Raccontiamo il Futuro”, we wanted to delve deeper into the topic, jokingly speaking, with this entertainment column. 

The crypto horoscope
We call it oroscopo crypto for the simple fact that sector terminology is used. 
Words like NFT, metaverse, and Over-The-Counter to describe actions and scenarios, but also trading terminology like bullish, bull run, bear market, or dump to identify the mood of each zodiac sign during the days of the week.
Obviously, the famous to-the-moon to indicate the mood of that sign cannot be missed! 
In general, you might experience a period of “hard-fork”, understood as an “inner split”, or pass your lightning torch to the next zodiac sign, meaning that the Sun is moving to the next sign. 
Or, simply, you need to reflect on some situations that go into “verify,” that is, when the planet is in dissonance with respect to the zodiac sign. Not only that, with each new change of the Sun’s guard through the constellations of the zodiac, the roadmap of each sign will reach a new step. 
Obviously, no investment advice is given; on the contrary, it is purely entertainment, just like any other horoscope. It must be said that many beginners in the sector have understood the specific crypto terminology thanks to the horoscope on The Cryptonomist. 
“Don’t Trust, Verify”
Astrology is not an exact science, but it aims in its own way to predict the future. So why not associate the typical blockchain phrase “Don’t Trust, Verify” here as well. 
And in fact, what the author wants to propose is her interpretation of the planetary transits that occur during the week, describing the reaction of each zodiac sign, following the “logic” of traditional astrology. 
For those who are astrology enthusiasts, they might stay updated just by following the transits that are communicated weekly, which, in some way, influence us. A Retrograde Mercury, rather than the days of Full Moon. 
Others, on the other hand, might access the dedicated page, which is updated every Sunday, and read the horoscope of their zodiac sign, their ascendant, or why not, even the horoscope of friends and loved ones. 
So, for entertainment purposes only, don’t waste time and click here to read your horoscope for this week!

zkSync Project Gemholic Under Suspicion for 3.5m Rug Pull - Details


								zkSync-based project Gemholic has been suspected of orchestrating a rug pull following a series of malicious moves on Saturday. The company behind the defunct decentralized exchange GemSwap has transferred out formerly inaccessible investor funds raising suspicions from the general crypto community.






Gemholic Vanishes From Social Media After Moving Investors’ Funds




In April 2023, Gemholic had 921 Ether (ETH), worth $1.7 million as of then, accidentally locked in one of its zkSync smart contracts, the GemstoneIDO due to an error in the transfer()function. After receiving a request for help from Gemholic, the development team at zkSync announced that the funds were intact and they had developed a solution to unlock the said contract. 
On June 7, 2024, zkSync implemented its recent v24 network upgrade on its mainnet which rectified this contract error, allowing Gemholic to gain access to the previously-locked funds. However, following this development, the team at Gemholic has withdrawn the 921 ETH now valued at $3.5 million from the project’s contract to an unassociated Ethereum wallet.
Furthermore, the zkSync-based project has now wiped off its digital footprint disabling all Telegram channels and X accounts. As expected, these actions have resulted in many crypto enthusiasts accusing Gemohlic of executing a rug pull after making false promises to investors over the last year. 
Gemholic had clearly stated the project would resume following the recovery of the locked funds. Notably on April 21, 2024, they posted on X saying:
We understand that many people have lost faith, but we still believe that the @zksync team can make things right. We need everyone to trust us. As soon as the contract is fixed, we will launch a marketing campaign and a pre-launch for the project. We will also refund the overflow…
However, with what appears to be a heist, Gemholic may be adding to a long list of rug pulls in the crypto space which is already a prominent concern with the nascent industry.


Web3 Dev Criticizes KYC Provider Over Silence
In more news, a Web3 developer with X handle @Nserec has called out blockchain security company SolidProof for their inability to address the alleged rug pull by the Gemholic after conducting the Know Your Customer verification process for the now defunct zkSync-based project. 
NSerec postulates this prolonged silence may be an attempt to prevent fear, uncertainty, and doubt (FUD) among customers. However, the developer demands that SolidProof release a statement admitting their ineptitude or report the case to appropriate legal authorities with an accompanying announcement.
Meanwhile, NSerec has also admonished affected customers of Gemholic’s alleged rug pull to reach out to Binance, as the project’s creator contact was initially funded by the prominent exchange.

Iggy Azalea Escalates Feud with Vitalik Buterin


Australian rapper Iggy Azalea has escalated her feud with Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin, seemingly accusing him of pocketing gas fees: "I'm not mad at this man's opinion. Whatever. I question what you are doing with gas money. It's so rich of you to have an opinion on charities and hospitals, whatever…but let’s talk about the gas fees…the gas tax." The bizarre remark from the controversial influencer attracted plenty of ridicule within the cryptocurrency community after going viral on the X social media network (formerly Twitter). Many Ethereum enthusiasts were seemingly stunned by Azalea's lack of basic understanding of how gas fees actually work on the Ethereum blockchain.cardMeanwhile, Adam Cochran, Cinneamhain Ventures partner, claims that Azalea's recent take actually represents a marketing challenge for the crypto industry. "Iggy thinking Vitalik takes the fees represents the marketing challenge all of crypto has. It’s also why I think L2s are the only way it reaches mass consumer adoption. Just like most consumers don’t understand the internet, and rely on their ISP managing connectivity," he said in a social media post.  Azalea, who achieved mainstream success in 2014 with several chart-topping hits, returned to the limelight in late May with the launch of her Mother Iggy (IGGY) token that has managed to surge more than 1,000% within just a week. She later stirred some buzz within the community by mocking Buterin with a meme on her social media profile after the latter poured cold water on her meme coin. Azalea is seemingly not ready to bury the hatchet just yet. "Maybe some people shouldn't have an opinion sometimes, but I respect that you made something. Don't get me wrong," Azalea added during a recent podcast appearance.

Major Investment Firm Bets Big on Plunging Altcoin: Buying for the First Time - Bitcoin Sistemi


According to cryptocurrency onchain data, wallets associated with cryptocurrency investment firm Nascent have made their first PEPE purchase ever.
Data shows that these wallets made $5.48 million worth of purchases on Binance during the PEPE price dip. Thanks to the purchase at the bottom, with the price increasing, Nascent wallets currently have an unrealized profit of 262 thousand dollars, or 4.8%, on PEPE positions at the time of writing.



When the cryptocurrency wallets of the company in question are examined, it is seen that the largest asset in the current situation is PEPE, with the last sales and purchases. This is followed by Maker DAO (MKR) and the company has an unrealized profit of $2.45 million, or 248%, in MKR.
Nascent seems to have benefited from this dip in memecoins, which dropped sharply during RoaringKitty's live broadcast yesterday.





The company's total assets are around 12.6 million dollars. Following PEPE and MKR, AWBTC, USDT, ACX, ETH and USDC are the largest assets.

Binance acquires 200 million users, doubling its user base in just over 2 years.
CEO Richard Teng shares his gratitude to the community members for their support over the years.
Binance’s user base is much larger than that of other leading exchanges like Coinbase and Bybit.




Binance, the largest cryptocurrency exchange by trading volume, has recently reached a remarkable milestone of 200 million users, doubling its user base in just over 2 years. The exchange celebrated the achievement via a recent X post, sharing its gratitude to the community members.









Standing at the success point, Binance declared that the platform would continue to strive for a 1 billion mark, stating, “Your support is the heartbeat of our journey to 1 billion users.”







The crypto exchange’s journey over the past years has been a roller-coaster ride with regulatory uncertainties and legal challenges. The SEC and CFTC’s lawsuits over the firm as well as former CEO Changpeng Zhao’s departure and subsequent imprisonment were major crises that Binance faced during the period. However, amidst this chaos, Binance acquired the support of a large number of users, showcasing the platform’s leading role in the crypto space.



Binance CEO Richard Teng joined the firm’s celebration, conveying his regards to the users. He acknowledged that the successful journey is the result of the community’s support. His post read,




We have hit 200M users Binance! This milestone wouldn’t have been possible without YOU – our incredible community. From the bottom of our hearts, thank you. The journey to 1 billion users continues. Let’s keep building together.




With this recent acquisition, Binance has once again proved its dominant position in the industry with no other exchanges to challenge. Leading exchanges like Coinbase and Bybit boast much lower users, reporting a user base of 98 million and 30 million, respectively.

Bitcoin Bulls Eye $83,000 if This Technical Pattern Pattern Plays Out


																“It is only a matter of time until Bitcoin makes a new all-time high,” said 10x Research CEO Markus Thielen in a note on June 7.
The analyst has observed a “head and shoulders” chart pattern, which is nearing completion. This could result in a “rally towards 83,000 soon,” he said, predicting that this may occur within the next week if resistance is broken.
However, bitcoin did hit resistance and retreated to just over $69,000 on June 7. Nevertheless, the analyst remains bullish, and the chart pattern is still in play.
Bitcoin Still Bullish
“We are bullish,” Thielen said, citing the start of the global central bank easing cycle, which has now been confirmed with interest rates being cut in Canada and Europe this week.
“With US growth, employment, and consumer spending weakening, it will only be a matter of time until inflation slows.”
US employment data was mixed, with the unemployment rate climbing to 4.0%, but an upside surprise was the number of jobs added. However, bitcoin prices have only climbed by 3.1% despite $4.8 billion of inflows during the past week, he said before adding that this was below the projected 5.8% rally predicted by regression analysis.




Thielen provided a detailed analysis of bitcoin’s price movements correlated to inflows of money, suggesting around $13 billion in new inflows would be needed to reach $83,000. A breakout above the $71,600 trend line will result in more upside buying, but $13 billion in inflows “requires quite some commitment,” he said before adding:
“Nevertheless, we think this is possible as a weaker US employment market and lower inflation data next week (3.3%) will likely provide the macro backdrop for new all-time highs.”
Capriole Fund founder Charles Edwards said that long-term holder selling was preventing prices from pushing higher.


BTC was trading at $69,420, and it found support during the Sunday morning Asian session, following a 2.5% decline in the past few days. A further breakdown could see it fall to support levels at $67,500. However, BTC needs to break $71,500 to see any further upward momentum.
Where Next for Ethereum?
Thielen was not so bullish about Ethereum. “Fundamentally, we are less bullish on Ethereum and expect ETF demand for Ether to disappoint,” he said.
Ethereum broke key support at $3,725 in the end-of-week dip in a fall to $3,640, but it managed to reclaim the $3,700 level during early weekend trading.


Zooming out, crypto markets remain within their range-bound channel and in the accumulation zone that typically follows a BTC halving event.

Ripple’s Former Director Urges Firm To Begin Investing in New Companies - Coin Edition


							

Ripple’s ex-director urged the firm to invest in another company.
The former director advised the FinTech firm to embark on a reinvestment campaign.
Ripple recently secured new partnerships across different regions.




Former Ripple Director Sean McBride has urged the FinTech firm to acquire another company. In a recent post on X, McBride asked Ripple to activate an investment cycle using the tons of funds it is sitting on. The former director said Ripple should “reinvest, build, and repeat.”







Ripple recently secured new partnerships across different regions. According to reports, the FinTech behemoth partnered with Santander (UK), CIBC (Canada), Kotak Mahindra Bank (India), and Itaú Unibanco (Brazil) to streamline cross-border transactions. 



Meanwhile, the firm’s new partnerships increased user activities on the XRP Ledger. It also led to a surge in transactions compared to the previous year. Following the partnerships, Ripple Chief Technology Officer (CTO) David Schwartz hinted at exploring the potential of integrating decentralized finance protocols with TradFi institutions.









Last Friday, the famous crypto tracking service Whale Alert spotted a significant XRP transaction involving Ripple. The crypto tracker noted the firm moved 150 million XRP coins to an unregistered blockchain wallet. The fiat value of the transaction was about $78.2 million at the time of Whale Alert’s report.



Whale Alert did not state any reason for Ripple to make such a significant transfer. That has left users wondering, especially crypto community members following the case between Ripple and the U.S. Security and Exchange Commission. 



Many crypto users are hopeful about a rise in XRP’s value, including McBride, whose recent post suggested he holds a significant amount of the altcoin. According to the former director, he looks forward to XRP realizing its actual value so he can focus on his family and other non-business-related activities.



XRP traded for $0.49418 at the time of writing, according to data from TradingView.

Friend.tech's Move to Friendchain: A Bold Leap or Risky Gamble? - Coin Edition


							

Friend.tech, a social media platform, is building its own blockchain called Friendchain.
Friendchain will use the platform’s native token, FRIEND.
The move is controversial, with experts questioning its necessity and potential drawbacks.




The decentralized social media platform Friend.tech, built initially on Coinbase’s layer-2 network Base, has announced its plan to create a proprietary blockchain named Friendchain. Friend.tech disclosed the new move via its official X account yesterday, June 8. 









According to the notification, Friend.tech is building the proposed blockchain with crypto infrastructure startup Conduit. Also, the platform plans to utilize its native token, FRIEND, on the new blockchain.







However, this announcement has garnered significant criticism from industry pundits who question the necessity of a blockchain dedicated to social media functions. “What is the value proposition of a social-focused chain?” asked Dr. Jojipup of trading platform AstraBit.



Amogh Gupta of the Sui Foundation expressed concerns about the move from the Base blockchain to a less battle-tested and more centralized infrastructure. In registering his disapproval, he recalled that  Conduit was the RaaS provider for the Degen chain that previously went down for over 24 hours.



Siong, the co-founder of Jupiter Exchange, questioned the effectiveness of the narrative surrounding the launch of a new blockchain in an era where creating one’s own Layer 2 is as simple as a single click.



Adding to the critical voices, Mothu et Doria, an Architect at Kinode OS, sarcastically highlighted the potential for increased utility and scalability that a new blockchain could bring to Friend.tech’s platform amid existing issues with the app’s performance and features.



Besides, commenters also raised concerns about the potential for increased gas fees on Friendchain, as Base is known for being a low-cost Ethereum layer-2 solution.



Despite the mixed reactions, the market reacted swiftly to the news. Friend’s price experienced a dramatic surge, soaring 64% to $1.31 post-announcement, only to settle back to $0.89 within the hour.

Anthony Scaramucci Says President Biden Won’t Lose Election on ‘Capricious Whims’ of Gary Gensler - The Daily Hodl


								SkyBridge Capital founder Anthony Scaramucci believes President Joe Biden will pander to the crypto industry even if it’s against the wishes of Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) Chair Gary Gensler.
In a new interview with the independent journalist David Lin, Scaramucci says Biden is starting to soften his stance on Bitcoin and crypto following the listing approval of spot Ethereum exchange-traded funds (ETF) last week.










According to the hedge fund veteran, Biden may lose votes from swing states if he gives in to the “capricious whims” of anti-crypto personalities.
“I think the Biden team, they vetoed this bill (SAB 121) last week but they did get the Ethereum stuff passed despite Elizabeth Warren and Gary Gensler not wanting it. I think they’re going to pivot… 
I think they’re going to pivot now on Bitcoin and crypto assets. I don’t think Biden, who is a moderate, I don’t think he wants to be left out in the dark on this. This is a razor-thin election, and I don’t think Joe Biden wants to lose this election because of the capricious whims of Elizabeth Warren or Gary Gensler.” 
Staff Accounting Bulletin (SAB) 121 is a note issued by the SEC in 2022 that says certain companies have to label digital assets as liabilities on their balance sheets even if they are simply holding the assets on behalf of customers.
Turning to Bitcoin (BTC), Scaramucci says he sees the crypto king going as high as $700,000 in the next decade and a half.
“This is a nascent asset. It only has 5% adoption in the United States. If it continues to scale and adopt at the same speed as the last 10 years, there’s no reason why this can’t be a $300,000, $400,000, $500,000 asset…
If gold’s [market cap] is at $16 trillion, Bitcoin’s at $1.5 trillion, could Bitcoin 10X in the next 15 years? I believe it can and I believe it has the technical properties to allow it to do that, and we’re already seeing that happen. It is already manifesting in that direction.”
At time of writing, Bitcoin is trading at $69,420.

17 Trillion Shiba Inu (SHIB) in 7 Days: What's Happening?

More than 17 trillion Shiba Inu tokens were moved in the last seven days, while Shiba Inu has been showing some notable increase in volatility. With the on-chain activity surging, we might expect some kind of bullish movement in the upcoming week, but it is not guaranteed.Recently, Shiba Inu has seen an increase in transactions. It is well known for its active community and meme coin status. A staggering 17 trillion SHIB tokens have changed hands in the last week, exciting and confusing traders and analysts. There are a few possible reasons for this activity surge. SHIB/USDT Chart by TradingViewSuch activity is frequently sparked by conjecture regarding potential new alliances and listings on significant exchanges. Announcements and rumors have a big impact on how the market behaves and when investors position themselves for possible price movements trading volumes rise. Shiba Inu's price has experienced significant volatility according to chart analysis. Testing of the support and resistance levels on a regular basis suggests a consolidation phase. This behavior indicates that SHIB may be about to make a significant decision at this pivotal point. We may see a notable upward or downward trend if the price breaks out of the current range. Another important set of indicators to keep an eye on are the moving averages (MAs). While the 200-day MA offers long-term trend direction, the 50-day MA has served as a level of support. SHIB is now in close proximity to these important levels. If the 200-day MA is still below the price, it may be a sign of bullish sentiment, but if it falls, it may hint at more declines in the foreseeable future. An intriguing picture is also painted by the data on big transactions. The volume and number of large transactions increased sharply, peaking on June 5 at 161 trillion SHIB and 731 transactions. According to this, major players may be positioning themselves for an upcoming volatility increase.

Will XRP drop to $0.4699 in June? A detailed breakdown - AMBCrypto



XRP was down by more than 4% in the last seven days. 
If the downturn continues, then the token might drop to $0.4699.

XRP has witnessed quite some turbulence as its price has dropped over the last week. But investors should prepare for more setbacks as the token fell below a pattern, that hinted at a further price drop. 
Bears step up
Per an earlier AMBCrypto report, XRP’s price had reached a 2-month low. This decline was caused by market jitters following reports that Ripple, the token’s developer and largest holder, sold 150 million XRP.
 According to CoinMarketCap, the price decline continued as the token’s value dropped by over 1.3% in the last 24 hours. 
At the time of writing, the token was trading at $0.4932 with a market capitalization of over $27 billion. The price decline also had a negative impact on the token’s price action. 
Santiment’s data revealed that XRP’s Weighted Sentiment went into the negative zone, implying that bearish sentiment around the token was dominant in the market. 
Nonetheless, the massive price drop stirred up conversations in the market, causing its Social Volume to spike. 
Source: Santiment
In a further spot of bad news, while XRP’s price dropped, it made a bearish breakout, which hinted at a continued price decline. 
Notably, XRP’s price entered a pennant pattern in the middle of April. Since then, the token has consolidated inside the pattern, only to make a bearish breakout on the 8th of June. 
Source: TradigView
Will XRP continue to fall?
AMBCrypto’s analysis of the token’s fear and greed index revealed that it had a value of 34% at press time, indicating that the market was in a “fear” phase. 
Whenever the metric reaches that level, it suggested that there are chances of a price increase. Therefore, to better understand what to expect, AMBCrypto analyzed the token’s daily chart. 
As per our analysis, the technical indicator MACD displayed a clear bearish advantage in the market. The token’s Relative Strength Index (RSI) also registered a sharp downtick, hinting at a further price drop.
 Nonetheless, the Chaikin Money Flow (CMF) looked optimistic as it went slightly northwards.

AMBCrypto then assessed Hyblock Capital’s data to look for possible targets for XRP this week.

Read Ripple’s [XRP] Price Prediction 2024-25 

If a trend reversal happens and the token gains bullish momentum, investors might witness the token reclaim $0.545. 
Generally, high liquidations result in short-term price corrections. On the other hand, if the token remains bearish, then XRP might drop to $0.4699.

UniSat Reaches 9,600 Daily Users Amid PIZZA Airdrop Success


According to data from a Dune dashboard, UniSat, a leading Bitcoin service provider known for its Ordinals marketplace, recently achieved a milestone by recording nearly 9,600 unique daily users.
This marks a record high for the platform, highlighting its growing influence in the crypto community.
PIZZA Airdrop Fuels UniSat’s Recent Rise

Alongside this surge, UniSat captured 43% of the market share among Ordinals marketplaces on the same day. This is the first time since September 2023 that UniSat has surpassed the 40% market share. It outperforms competitors like OKX and Magic Eden, which previously dominated the market.

Many attribute UniSat’s recent success to its latest airdrop of the BRC-20 token PIZZA. On May 22, UniSat announced the deployment of the 5-byte ticker ‘pizza’ and offered free “slices” of pizza to eligible addresses, which has been fully distributed today.
PIZZA’s price jumped from 0.00008910 BTC ($6.18) to 0.000116 BTC ($8.04) following the airdrop. However, it now stabilizes at 0.0001085 BTC ($7.52) at the time of writing.

This development is particularly interesting given that Runes token standard transactions have outperformed BRC-20 and Ordinals transactions. As of June 8, Runes transactions totaled 120,781, while BRC-20 and Ordinals transactions totaled 53,129 and 920, respectively. This trend has been ongoing since at least mid-April.
Despite the rise of other token standards within the Bitcoin ecosystem, the success of PIZZA demonstrates Bitcoin’s evolution beyond a store of value. Innovations in non-fungible tokens (NFTs) and decentralized finance (DeFi) drive this transformation, as Franklin Templeton highlighted in its April report.

“In the past year, Bitcoin innovation and development has seen a renaissance in activity. Positive momentum in innovation is primarily driven through Bitcoin NFTs, known as Ordinals, new fungible tokens standards such as BRC-20 and Runes, Bitcoin Layer-2s, and other Bitcoin DeFi primitives,” the asset management giant wrote.

Here's the Amount of Terra Classic (LUNC) Binance Burned This Month - Bitcoin Sistemi


Cryptocurrency exchange Binance continues its regular Terra Classic (LUNC) burns, according to data.
Data shows that Binance has burned approximately 1.3 billion LUNC tokens in a total of 3 transactions so far in June. This means that at the time of writing this article, the cryptocurrency exchange has burned approximately 144 thousand dollars of LUNC tokens in total this month.


For an altcoin LUNC with a market value of $615 million, this burning amount is not an amount that can affect the price much, and on its chart, the token has lost approximately +10 value in the last week.

Approximately half of all Terra Classic token burns to date have been issued by Binance. The value of LUNC tokens burned by the cryptocurrency exchange to date is at the level of 6.4 million dollars. So Binance has burned approximately 1% of the total supply of this altcoin so far.





The exchange carries out its largest token burns at the beginning of the month, but small amounts of burns can also be seen on other days. In other words, Binance Terra Classic burns in June may increase slightly.

Shiba Inu (SHIB) Looks Ready to Spike to a New ATH (Analysts)


																TL;DR

Shiba Inu has been struggling to catch up with the booming crypto market lately, recording a slight price decrease in the past seven days.
Despite this, some analysts predict a bull run, with potential targets up to $0.00014 toward the end of the year.


The Odds of a New Substantial Rally
Contrary to the overall market resurgence in the past few days, the popular meme coin Shiba Inu (SHIB) has underperformed. Its price is down 8% weekly, while the market capitalization slipped below the $15 billion mark.
Nonetheless, some industry participants believe the following months will be quite successful for the self-proclaimed Dogecoin killer, envisioning impressive increases. 
The X user Mags presented a price chart, according to which the meme coin’s value could shoot to an all-time high of over $0.00014 by September this year. They also warned investors that the current level is “the last chance to buy SHIB before up only.”
The analyst depicted $0.00002100 as a major resistance level, admitting purchasing SHIB at the start of 2024 when the price was around $0.00000950. Their investment has increased by 165% due to the token’s bull run experienced in the past few months.




CryptoYoddha was also bullish, forecasting a price ascent toward $0.000075 by the end of 2024 (a 200% jump from the current valuation). The analyst thinks SHIB will not be the only meme coin to flourish in the upcoming months, envisioning a bright future for Pepe (PEPE) and Dogecoin (DOGE).
SHIB Whales on the Move
The asset’s latest price decline came despite the increased activity from large investors. As CryptoPotato reported, one whale accumulated over 715 billion SHIB on June 5, while two others purchased the staggering 1.35 trillion tokens.
Whale activity is often seen as a move that can create positive investor sentiment. The development could lead to more people buying SHIB, thus driving a price surge. 
On the other hand, if whales decide to sell off their holdings, it can result in sharp declines. After all, fundamental principles of economics state that prices tend to rise when there is scarcity and growing demand and not in the event of abundance.

This Week on Crypto Twitter: Roaring Kitty Shows His Face, Gets Rekt - Decrypt

We do the research, you get the alpha!Get exclusive reports and access to key insights on airdrops, NFTs, and more! Subscribe now to Alpha Reports and up your game!Go to Alpha ReportsIllustration by Mitchell Preffer for DecryptThe revived saga of Keith Gill, aka Roaring Kitty, hit a crescendo this week when the meme stock influencer last seen in 2021 finally showed his face on a livestream after weeks of mysterious, market-altering social media posts that some had doubted were actually from him.It was really him. The event came with market-wide ramifications—some of which did not work out in Gill’s favor.After reports that Gill might be in trouble with regulators and trading platforms for posting a series of cryptic tweets and less-cryptic posts on Reddit that quadrupled the price of Gamestop (GME)—and similarly pumped other meme stocks and related crypto tokens—the influencer scheduled a live broadcast on YouTube for Friday.As soon as the broadcast began, Twitter erupted, unleashing a week's worth of Crypto Twitter craziness in a matter of hours. And the appearance—Gill’s first in years—was characteristically absurd, partly thanks to his wearing bandages and an arm sling. Twitter users rejoiced as the mainstream financial press begrudgingly—but breathlessly—covered the stream, given Gill’s historically outsize influence over meme stocks.During the show, Gill delved into his GME position, which had caught the eye of market watchers even before he revealed it was him. It was worth hundreds of millions of dollars, and had grown by leaps and bounds almost daily.Many speculated that holding such a position could put the influencer in hot water given his proven market-moving power. That context certainly cast a pall over Gill’s livestream on Friday. Indeed, the trader started by asking over 700,000 viewers,  “Do I have to be careful about what I say here?”The most immediate market movement that day, however, was not caused by Gill nor by regulators, but instead by the company whose stock he favored: GameStop released its quarterly earnings report four days early—basically beating Roaring Kitty to the spotlight—and the numbers were not great.Over the course of Friday, GME plunged nearly 40%, wiping out some $235 million from Gill’s position.Some felt the GME cause would have been better served if Gill never spoke. But others were adamant that in several crucial, even subtle ways, Roaring Kitty’s chaotic revival was actually a quiet success.Edited by Ryan Ozawa.Daily Debrief NewsletterStart every day with the top news stories right now, plus original features, a podcast, videos and more.

Breakout watch: Cardano key support and resistance levels for this week


    Cardano (ADA) revisited the bearish $0.43 price, punished by macroeconomic indicators and overall negative sentiments in the cryptocurrency market. Finbold looked for insights on key support and resistance levels ADA traders should watch this week.



Notably, Cardano has been trading in a well-defined two-month range since April 14, from $0.43 to $0.50. During this time, ADA has made a few brief deviations from the price range but without breaking out.



Therefore, the $0.43 and the $0.50 levels remain the most important support and resistance to watch for. A breakout, followed by confirmation with increased volume, from any of these levels would bring a more aggressive move.







However, there is still relevant resistance at $0.57, which previously worked as support before April’s breakout downwards. As of this writing, Cardano trades at $0.44 below the 30-day exponential moving average (30-EMA) at $0.46.

Cardano on-chain data for key support and resistance levels



Looking further, Finbold gathered on-chain data from IntoTheBlock on June 9, which highlights other Cardano key support and resistance levels.



In particular, the “In/Out of the Money Around Price” metric shows strong resistance at higher prices than current ones. The largest volume is within the $0.453 to $0.464 level, at an average of $0.458. 162,420 addresses purchased over 3.21 billion ADA at these prices and are currently in losses.



This resistance level coincides with the 30-EMA of $0.46 in the daily chart.



On the other hand, there is no relevant volume to the downside, suggesting weaker support to the range’s low for ADA. Nevertheless, 134,180 addresses purchased 1.59 billion ADA between $0.373 and $0.388, at $0.38 on average. This represents the most likely support level if Cardano remains with weak momentum and breaks down from its range.



In/Out of the Money Around Price. Source: IntoTheBlock



In conclusion, Cardano’s key support and resistance levels to watch are $0.38, $0.43, $0.46, $0.50, and $0.57. The resistance levels are more robust than the support, suggesting a downside breakout. It is important, however, to understand that cryptocurrencies are highly volatile digital assets, and indicators are not conclusive.

XRP's Price Performance Is Not as Bad as It Looks: Analyst


Ripple-affiliated XRP cryptocurrency has underperformed 90 out of the 100 biggest cryptocurrencies by market capitalization over the past 24 hours. Prominent trader Peter Brandt recently suggested that the price of XRP could end up plummeting to zero against Bitcoin.That said, this seemingly dismal price action might not be as bad as it looks.As noted by analyst Bill Morgan, these figures are highly skewed by the massive rally that the token experienced following Ripple’s partial win against the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission last July.While XRP’s price performance might not be that atrocious, the analyst is still puzzled by XRP’s complete failure to sustain its momentum following the July court ruling.“The better question is not why XRP price is underperforming other top 100 coins but why the post summary judgment price rise impact was not sustained and almost entirely lost and why XRP is still trading at prices visited in 2018,” Morgan said in a post on the X social media network.Short-lived price rallyAfter U.S. District Judge Analisa Torres ruled that XRP is a security only when Ripple would sell it to institutional buyers, the price of the controversial token experienced a major rally.XRP surged to a 2023 peak of $0.94 on the Bitstamp exchange following the ruling. However, this renewed excitement surrounding XRP was very short-lived, with the token collapsing 57% since the post-ruling peak.At press time, XRP is trading at $0.49 on the Bitstamp exchange. For comparison, the token peaked at roughly $0.71 in July 2018 despite the fact that cryptocurrencies were in the middle of a bear market.Ripple not suppressing XRPWhile some community members have expressed concerns about Ripple potentially artificially suppressing the price of the XRP token with its artificial sales, Morgan is convinced that this is not the case.As reported by U.Today, Morgan has pointed out that Ripple offers no discounts to on-demand liquidity (ODL) customers, which means that the company's ODL sales have neutral impact on the company's price.

Trader Who Nailed 2022 BTC Collapse Predicts Ethereum Rally, Says Bullish Continuation in Sight for Crypto Market - The Daily Hodl


								A trader who accurately called Bitcoin’s (BTC) epic 2022 meltdown thinks Ethereum (ETH) is gearing up to revisit its all-time highs
Pseudonymous analyst Capo tells his 847,900 followers on the social media platform X that he’s bullish on Ethereum as long as it holds its immediate support at $3,600.










“ETH looking good for bullish continuation.”
Source: Capo/X
Based on the trader’s chart, he appears to predict that Ethereum will rally to $4,100 before a slight correction and a move toward its all-time high at around $4,900.
At time of writing, Ethereum is worth $3,683, a fractional decrease in the past day.
Looking at the broader crypto market, Capo says the marketwide correction last Friday is most likely a sell-off event designed to shake out weak hands. According to the analyst, crypto will see renewed rallies if BTC stays above $69,000 and ETH trades higher than $3,600.
“Strong sell-off into support. Alts suffered more, but it looks like a shakeout to be honest. If these support levels hold, we should see bullish continuation soon.” 
Source: Capo/X
At time of writing, Bitcoin is worth $69,429.
Capo also says that he still believes altcoins will ignite surges this month even after last Friday’s correction.
“I think June could be a really good month for altcoins.”

Here's BTC's support level for buying opportunity to watch out closely


    As the crypto market monitors Bitcoin’s (BTC) next price trajectory and the possibility of breaching the $70,000 resistance, a trading expert has pointed out potential opportunities for investors to consider.



In a TradingView post on June 7, the analyst TradingShot highlighted a medium-term pattern that aligns with Bitcoin’s long-term bullish trend but contradicts the short-term market euphoria of recent days.



The analysis revealed key insights into potential buying opportunities based on historical price patterns and technical indicators.







According to TradingShot, the critical support level for potential buying opportunities lies within the range of the  50-day moving average (MA50) and the bottom of the green rectangle. This range is identified as the “buy zone,” where investors might consider accumulating Bitcoin.



The expert pointed out that since December 2022, Bitcoin has been moving within a dominant “Channel Up” pattern. Within this upward channel, it experienced its first significant correction through a rectangle pattern, identified as an accumulation phase.

Bitcoin’s price found support during this phase, formed a bottom, and rose again after briefly dipping below MA50 and nearing the 100-day moving average (MA100).



Bitcoin’s rejection zone 



TradingShot suggested that if a similar accumulation phase occurs again, Bitcoin might currently be at a ‘hammer’ rejection level at around $71,100, reminiscent of the price movement observed around July 12, 2023. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) patterns during these phases are notably similar, indicating potential buying opportunities.



It is worth noting that Bitcoin is experiencing a consolidation phase, with both bulls and bears tussling to influence the asset in either direction. Indeed, the pivotal focus is on whether Bitcoin can reclaim the $70,000 mark.



In this context, in an X post on June 7, crypto trading expert Michaël van de Poppe acknowledged that Bitcoin was still stuck in a range. He noted that the current trading pattern means that the leading cryptocurrency is ‘very heavily ready’ for a breakout in search of a new all-time high.

The analyst added that Bitcoin has also rejected the $71,600 level, and investors should expect a breakout in the coming week.



Bitcoin price analysis



By press time, Bitcoin was trading at $69,340, having corrected by less than 0.1% in the past 24 hours. On the weekly timeframe, the crypto is up almost 3%.

Despite the consolidation, Bitcoin’s technical analysis points to a bullish sentiment. A summary of the one-day gauges aligns with the ‘buy’ sentiment at 13, while moving averages indicate a ‘strong buy’ at 13. Oscillators are bearish, signaling ‘sell’ at 2.

In summary, as Bitcoin remains stuck in its current position, it is now up to the bulls and bears to dictate the asset’s next price action in search of a new all-time high.

Ripple Initiates Discussions with NBG to Expand to Georgia Coin Edition


							

As per recent reports, Ripple has been planning to expand its footprint in Georgia.
Ripple’s executives have communicated with the National Bank of Georgia (NBG).
Previously, NBG announced Ripple as the technology partner of its CBDC project, Digital Lari.




Recent reports suggest that the blockchain firm Ripple is planning to expand its footprint in Georgia. As per a recent X post shared by Ripple’s CBDC Advisor Antony Welfare, Ripple’s Vice President James Wallis and Ripple partner EPAM Systems’ representative Alistair Brown have been in communication with the National Bank of Georgia (NBG).







Welfare shared a screenshot that highlighted the key focus of the Ripple executives’ meeting with the NBG. Reportedly, the discussion focused on “exploring potential avenues for collaboration in the digitalization of the Georgian economy.”









Notably, Ripple is the official technology partner of NBG’s Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC) project, Digital Lari. In a press release dated November 2, 2023, Ripple asserted that NBG chose Ripple after a competitive selection process.



Reflecting on the National Bank’s statement, Ripple stated that the selection was based on Ripple’s “deep understanding of the project’s purposes and use cases, as well as a full commitment to the project’s success, sustainable business continuity, clear project development roadmap, and gradual deployment approach to use-cases.” In addition, the bank highlighted Ripple’s experience in “conducting real-life pilot project deployments, ranging from primary CBDC digital infrastructure to smart contracts and tokenization.”



Despite these developments, Ripple’s native token, XRP is moving through a bearish trail. As of press time, XRP stands at a price of $0.4941, marking a slight dip of 0.96% in one day. Over the past 7 days and 30 days, the token has experienced more notable declines of 4.65% and 5.35%, respectively. A significant decline of 66% in the 24-hour trading volume of XRP showcases the token’s lowering interest in the community.

How To Create Hyper-Realistic AI Images with Stable Diffusion - Decrypt

Are you ready to blur the line between reality and AI-generated art?If you follow the generative AI space, and image generation in particular, you're likely familiar with Stable Diffusion. This open-source AI platform has ignited a creative revolution, empowering artists and enthusiasts alike to explore the realms of human creativity—all on their own computers, for free.With any simple prompt, you can get a picturesque landscape, a fantasy illustration, a 3D creature or a cartoon. But the real eye-popping capabilities are in the ability of these tools to create stunningly realistic imagery.To do so requires some finesse, however, and some attention to detail that generalistic models sometimes lack. Some avid users can quickly tell when an image is generated with MidJourney or Dall-e just by looking at it. But when it comes to creating images that fool the human brain, Stable Diffusion's versatility is unbeaten.From the meticulous handling of color and composition to the uncanny ability to convey human emotion and expression, some custom models are redefining what's possible in the world of generative AI. Here are some specialized models that we think are la crème de la crème of hyper-realistic image generation with Stable Diffusion.We used the same prompt with all of our models and avoided using LoRas—Low-Rank Adaptation add-on modifiers—to be more fair in our comparisons. Our results were based on prompting and text embeddings. We also used incremental changes to test small variations in our generations.The promptsOur positive prompt was: professional photo, closeup portrait photo of caucasian man, wearing a black sweater, serious face, dramatic lighting, nature, gloomy, cloudy weather, bokehOur negative prompt (instructing Stable Diffusion on what not to generate) was: embedding:BadDream, embedding:UnrealisticDream, embedding:FastNegativeV2, embedding:JuggernautNegative-neg, (deformed iris, deformed pupils, semi-realistic, cgi, 3d, render, sketch, cartoon, drawing, anime:1.4), text, cropped, out of frame, worst quality, low quality, jpeg artifacts, ugly, duplicate, morbid, mutilated, extra fingers, mutated hands, poorly drawn hands, poorly drawn face, mutation, deformed, blurry, dehydrated, bad anatomy, bad proportions, extra limbs, cloned face, disfigured, gross proportions, malformed limbs, missing arms, missing legs, extra arms, extra legs, fused fingers, too many fingers, long neck, embedding:negative_hand-neg.All of the resources used will be listed at the end of this article.Stable Diffusion 1.5: the AI veteran that's aging with graceStable Diffusion 1.5 is like a good old American muscle car that beat fancier, latest-model cars in a drag race. Developers have been messing around with SD1.5 for so long that it effectively buried Stable Diffusion 2.1 in the ground. In fact, a lot of users today still prefer this version over SDXL, which is two generations newer.When it comes to creating images that are virtually indistinguishable from real-life photos, these models are your new best friends.1. Juggernaut RbornJuggernaut Rborn is a fan-favorite model is known for its realistic color composition and impressive ability to differentiate between subjects and backgrounds. This model is particularly good at generating high-quality skin details, hair, and bokeh effects in portraits.The latest version has been fine-tuned to deliver even more compelling results. Juggernaut has always offered color compositions that tend to be more realistic than the saturated, unnatural colors of many other Stable Diffusion models. Its generations tend to be warmer, more washed out, similar to an unedited RAW photo.Getting the best results will still require some tweaking: use the DPM++ 2M Karras sampler, set to around 35 steps, and an average CFG scale of 7.2. Realistic Vision v5.1A true trailblazer in the realm of photorealistic image generation, Realistic Vision v5.1 brought a pivotal moment in the evolution of Stable Diffusion, enabling it to compete against MidJourney and any other model in terms of photorealism. The v5.1 iteration excels at capturing facial expressions and imperfections, making it a top choice for portrait enthusiasts. It also handles emotions well and focuses more on the subject than the background, ensuring the final result is always realistic. This model is a popular choice thanks to its impressive performance and versatility.There is a newer version (v6.0), but we like V5.1 more because we feel it is still better in the little details that matter in realistic images. Things like skin, hair, or nails tend to be more convincing in 5.1, but other than that, results are similar, and the improvements seem incremental.3. I Can’t Believe It’s Not PhotographyWith its versatility and impressive lighting effects, the cheekily named I Can’t Believe It’s Not Photography model is a great all-around option for hyper-realistic image generation. It is very creative, handles different angles well, and can be used for a variety of subjects, not just people.This model is particularly good at 640x960 resolution —which is higher than original SD1.5— but can also deliver great results at 768x1152 which is a level of resolution native to SDXL.For optimal results, use the DPM++ 3M SDE Karras or DPM++ 2M Karras sampler, 20-30 steps, and a 2.5-5 CFG scale (which is lower than usual).Honorable Mentions:Photon V1: This versatile model excels in producing realistic results for a wide range of subjects, including people.Realistic Stock Photo: If you want to generate people with the polished and perfected look of stock photos, this model is an excellent choice. It creates convincing and accurate images without any skin imperfections.aZovya Photoreal: Although not as well-known, this model produces impressive results and can enhance the performance of other models when merged with their training recipes.Stable Diffusion XL: The Versatile VisionariesWhile Stable Diffusion 1.5 is our top pick for photorealistic images, Stable Diffusion XL offers more versatility and high-quality results without resorting to tricks like upscaling. It requires a little bit of power, but can be run with GPUs with 6GB of vRAM—2GB less than SD1.5 requires.Here are the models that are leading the charge.1. Juggernaut XL (Version x)Building on the success of its predecessor, Juggernaut XL brings a cinematic look and impressive subject focus to Stable Diffusion XL. This model delivers the same characteristic color composition that steps away from saturation, along with good body proportions and the ability to understand long prompts. It focuses more on the subject and it defines the factions very well—as well as any SDXL model can right now.For the best results, use a resolution of 832x1216 (for portraits), the DPM++ 2M Karras sampler, 30-40 steps, and a low CFG scale of 3-7.2. RealVisXLCustomized with realism in mind, RealVisXL is a top choice for capturing the subtle imperfections that make us human. It excels at generating skin lines, moles, changes of tones, and jaws, ensuring that the final result is always convincing. It is probably the best model to generate realistic humans.For optimal results, use 15-30+ sampling steps and the DPM++ 2M Karras sampling method.3. HelloWorld XL v6.0Generalistic model HelloWorld XL v6.0 offers a unique approach to image generation, thanks to its use of GPT4v tagging. While it may take some time to get used to, the results are well worth the effort.This model is particularly good at delivering the analog aesthetic that is often missing in AI-generated images. It also handles body proportions, imperfections, and lighting well. However, it is different from other SDXL models at its core, which means that you may need to adjust your prompts and tags to achieve the best results.For comparison, here is a similar generation using the GPT4v tagging, with the positive prompt: film aesthetic, professional photo, closeup portrait photo of caucasian man, wearing black sweater, serious face, in the nature, gloomy and cloudy weather, wearing a wool black sweater, deeply atmospheric, cinematic quality, hints of analog photography influence.Honorable mentions for SDXL include: PhotoPedia XL, Realism Engine SDXL and the deprecated Fully Real XL.Pro tips for hyper-realistic imagesNo matter which model you choose, here are some expert tips to help you achieve impressive, lifelike results:

Experiment with embeddings: To enhance the aesthetics of your images, try using embeddings recommended by the model creator or use widely popular ones like BadDream, UnrealisticDream, FastNegativeV2, and JuggernautNegative-neg. There are also embeddings available for specific features, such as hands, eyes, and specific .


Embrace the power of LoRAs: While we left them out here, these handy tools can help you add details, adjust lighting, and enhance skin texture in your images. There are many LoRAs available, so don't be afraid to experiment and find the ones that work best for you.


Use face detailing extension tools: These features can help you achieve excellent results in faces and hands, making your images even more convincing. The Adetailer extension is available for A1111, while the Face Detailer Pipe node can be used in ComfyUI.


Get creative with ControlNets: If you're a perfectionist when it comes to hands, ControlNets can help you achieve flawless results. There are also ControlNets available for other features, such as faces and bodies, so don't be afraid to experiment and find the ones that work best for you.

For help gettings started, you can read our guide to Stable Diffusion.Here are the resources we referenced in this guide:SD1.5 Models:SDXL Models:Embeddings:We hope you found this tour of Stable Diffusion tools helpful as you explore AI-generated images and art.

Key Reason Why Bitcoin Price Has Not Topped $70K Named by Top Trader

According to trader Gert van Lagen, long-term Bitcoin holders distributing their acquired coins to new ETF holders is the key reason why the leading cryptocurrency by market capitalization is yet to decisively break the $70,000 level.In mid-May, van Lagen noted that the distribution of long-term Bitcoin holders to short-term ones was already in "full swing." This assumption is based on recent on-chain data that shows the roll over in coins that were held longer than 12 months."Parabolic" price discoveryVan Lagen has stated that previous distributions of this kind led to "parabolic" price discoveries at first. These price discoveries would be followed by prolonged bear markets.Despite Bitcoin failing to gain a footing above the crucial $70,000 level, the consensus appears to be that the ongoing bull run is far from over.As reported by U.Today, Galaxy Digital CEO Mike Novogratz has predicted that the price of the bellwether cryptocurrency could potentially reach $100,000 by the end of the year if it manages to surpass the major resistance area around $73,000 in the near future.Both Fundstrat co-founder Tom Lee and prominent commodity trader Peter Brandt see the price of Bitcoin potentially peaking at $150,000 during this cycle.Bitcoin ETFs are on rollU.S.-based spot exchange-traded funds (ETFs) have managed to record 19 days of consecutive inflows. As reported by U.Today, these products recorded the second-largest inflows ever ($880 million) on Tuesday.According to leading analyst Eric Balchunas, Bitcoin ETFs are showing impressive staying power despite their volatile performance.Throwing wrench in worksDespite highly impressive ETF flows, the Bitcoin price plunged on Friday following the release of U.S. jobs data. The number of jobs added in May was much higher than expected. The strength of the labor market will likely dissuade the U.S. Federal Reserve from speeding up rate cuts. Such a scenario will not be beneficial for risk assets like Bitcoin.

Bitcoin Price To Stay Afloat At $67,000? Here’s The Level To Watch | Bitcoinist.com


								The Bitcoin price took a major hit at the end of the past week, falling below the psychological $70,000 level yet again. According to CoinGecko data, the price of BTC currently stands around $69,204, reflecting a 0.1% decline in the past day.
However, on-chain data suggests that the premier cryptocurrency is currently retesting a significant support level and might soon resume its upward trajectory.
Nearly 2 Million Addresses Purchased At This Bitcoin Price
In a recent post on the X platform, prominent crypto pundit Ali Martinez revealed that Bitcoin has established a major support area around its current price point. This evaluation revolves around the number of coins purchased around the current price level, according to IntoTheBlock’s data.

Source: Ali_charts/X

Above is a chart showing the distribution of the Bitcoin supply across various price ranges. The size of the dots in the chart depicts the strength of the resistance and support zones and the volume of coins acquired around each corresponding price range.
Data from the market intelligence firm shows that a massive 1.97 million addresses bought roughly 965,000 BTC between the $67,353 and $69,383 levels. According to Martinez, the significant buying activity within this price zone has led to the establishment of a key support area.  
In the post on X, the crypto analyst highlighted the strength and importance of the range BTC’s price is currently wedged in between. Martinez noted that the $67,353 – $69,383 support zone needs to hold strong for the Bitcoin price to “sustain its upward momentum.”
The nearly 2 million investors who have their cost basis around this support area could double down on their position and accumulate more BTC, and this buying activity – if sufficient – can ensure that the support stands strong. However, if this vital support area fails to hold, investors could see the price of BTC fall to as low as $65,000.
$1.57 Billion In BTC Withdrawn From Centralized Exchanges
An on-chain development that could potentially impact the Bitcoin price and help keep it above the aforementioned support level has come to light. In another post on X, Ali Martinez shared that investor confidence seems to be on the rise at the moment. 

The crypto analyst revealed that significant amounts of BTC made their way out of centralized exchanges in the past week. According to data from Glassnode, roughly 22,647 BTC (equivalent to more than $1.57 billion) were transferred from crypto exchanges in the last seven days.

This massive outflow of crypto funds from trading platforms suggests a shift in investor sentiment and strategy. What’s more, it might be indicative of fresh accumulation, with investors not willing to leave their newly acquired assets in the custody of centralized exchanges.

Giant PEPE Whales Accumulate 881B+ Coins: What's Happening? - Coin Edition


							

One whale bought 231.6B PEPE worth $2.9M from Kraken today.
Nascent and another whale accumulated over 647 billion PEPE from Binance.
One investor turned $494K into $5.3M within six months via PEPE.




Prominent crypto investors continue to accumulate the high-performing meme coin PEPE regardless of current market dynamics. The crypto surveillance platform Lookonchain called attention to the latest activity of a whale with wallet initials “0x689d6140.”



According to the update, this whale withdrew 231.6 billion PEPE, valued at over $2.9 million, from the U.S.-based Kraken exchange early today. The move followed a withdrawal of 36 billion PEPE from the exchange two days earlier.





Blockchain records reveal that this investor has accumulated PEPE since March, with total outbound transactions from Kraken exceeding 750.34 billion PEPE tokens, worth over $8.34 million. 





Remarkably, this accumulation has continued without any sales during PEPE’s uptrend and subsequent dip. For instance, the whale purchased 123.8 billion PEPE while the meme coin traded at an all-time high in late May. 



Amid significant price corrections, with PEPE’s value dropping by more than 28% since reaching its $0.00001718 ATH, the whale bought an additional 231.6 billion PEPE just 12 hours ago. Lookonchain estimates that the whale’s total acquisition over the last 90 days was at an average price of $0.00001111 per PEPE.









However, wallet “0x689d6140” is not the only prominent entity accumulating PEPE recently. Yesterday, Nascent, a team of builders who support early-stage crypto founders, acquired over 447.66 billion PEPE tokens from Binance. This followed a withdrawal of 4.48 million PEPE two days earlier. 



Additionally, Lookonchain identified another fresh wallet that stocked 202.4 billion PEPE from Binance on June 3. In total, whales have accumulated at least 881.67 billion PEPE this month. 



Meanwhile, Lookonchain reported a whale who deposited 365.96 billion PEPE worth $5.3 million into Binance for profit on June 4. This whale had previously withdrawn 365.96 billion PEPE worth $494,000 from the MEXC exchange in December 2023. Essentially, the investor turned $494,000 into $5.3 million in less than six months, achieving a profit of $4.82 million and an ROI of 976%.

Funding Roundup: Modular blockchain solutions led this week’s funding - Blockworks


Another week, another slew of fund raises. 
This week, we saw a slew of different raises that raised significant capital, with a modular blockchain solution and an infrastructure layer leading the pack when it comes to total amounts raised. There were also some notable, yet smaller, raises. 
Let’s get into it.
First and foremost we have Avail, which raised $43 million in its Series A. In total, the modular blockchain solution raised $75 million when combining the pre-seed and seed rounds — which totaled $32 million — and Series A.
Dragonfly Capital and Peter Thiel’s Founders Fund participated in the round, alongside a series of other VC firms. 
 “With this new capital, we are poised to accelerate our development, expand our global presence, and continue to address the most critical challenges facing Web3 today, such as blockchain fragmentation, insufficient data availability, and limited scaling,” said Anurag Arjun, Avail’s co-founder. “Additionally, it will help foster partnerships and collaborations with other players across the entire Web3 ecosystem, which is mission-critical for Avail’s success.”
According to a press release, Avail will focus on its Unification Layer roadmap. The next update to that will be Avail Nexus to solve cross-rollup interoperability. 
The funding will also go towards developing Fusion Security, which would leverage “native assets of mature ecosystems and new rollup tokens.” 
“Fusion Security aims to provide robust crypto-economic guarantees, reinforcing Avail’s function as the unification layer for Web3,” Avail continued.
A Mountain on the horizon
Oh, wait, that’s just Mountain Protocol. 
Mountain Protocol raised $8 million in a round led by Multicoin Capital for USDM, a yield-bearing stablecoin. This brings the project’s total funding to $12 million. 
Coinbase Ventures and Castle Island Ventures also participated in the round. 

“When it comes to money, trust and safety are of primary importance. The source of yield should share the same sovereign risk as the underlying currency – no less, no more,” Vishal Kankani, Multicoin Capital’s principal, told Blockworks. 
“Earning yields without having to do anything is the only user experience that can scale stablecoins to billions of people. Treasury managers, crypto exchanges, and fintechs in emerging markets giving dollar exposure to their customers all must pay attention to USDM,” he continued. 
According to the press release, there’s $50 million USDM in circulation. It launched back in October 2023. 
It was granted a Digital Asset Business License by the Bermuda Monetary Authority to redeem, issue and sell USDM, the release said.
Other notable rounds 

Decentralized infrastructure layer M^0 raised $35 million in a Series A led by Bain Capital Crypto and Galaxy Ventures. 
Stablecoin issuer Tether invested $18.75 million in XREX group to “drive innovation in Regulatory Technology.”
Blueberry Protocol Foundation announced a $2.5 million round led by White Star and Varys Capital.

What is Polkadot?Polkadot is a blockchain platform and cryptocurrency, with DOT being its native token. The platform is designed to enable different blockchains to exchange messages and perform transactions without the need for a trusted third-party. This capability facilitates cross-chain transfers of data and assets, making it possible to build decentralized applications (dApps) on the Polkadot network.The primary blockchain in the Polkadot network is the relay chain. It is responsible for network governance, validating data, achieving consensus and executing transactions. User-created parallel chains are auctioned off. These allow users to create and operate their own blockchains using Polkadot's infrastructure.The relay chain acts as the governance layer of the Polkadot network, ensuring that all transactions and data transfers are validated and consensus is achieved across the network. Parachains leverage this infrastructure to operate independently while still benefiting from the security and interoperability provided by the relay chain.In addition, Polkadot enables seamless cross-chain communication and transfers, making it a versatile platform for building interconnected blockchain ecosystems. The network is capable of processing approximately 1,000 transactions per second, showcasing its scalability and efficiency.Important updates and new projectsPolkadot has recently implemented a significant upgrade called Asynchronous Backing, which optimizes the validation process for parachain blocks by the relay chain. This upgrade brings several improvements.The relay chain is now twice as fast in producing blocks., while the protocol supports three-five times more extrinsics per block. There is a 6-10 times boost in blockspace availability, allowing for greater scalability.To bolster its presence and growth in Asia, Polkadot has launched PolkaPort East in Hong Kong. This independent entity is tasked with leading investor relations and expanding Polkadot's footprint in the Greater Bay Area.The Web3 Foundation has provided a grant to PolkaPort East to support its initiatives. PolkaPort East will focus on attracting participants to the Polkadot ecosystem, including projects, developers, VCs, funds and general Web3 investors.The initiative will target various groups, such as university blockchain collectives, fintech companies and local governments interested in blockchain technology.Price breakout soon?Polkadot (DOT) is currently experiencing a local low at $6.6. This week, the price has dropped from $7.6, a key level that has repeatedly hindered the price from rising further and caused a shift from a positive to a negative trend. Conversely, the price has found substantial support at $7, where buying pressure has historically been robust enough to prevent further decline.Source: CoinMarketCapSince mid-March, when DOT surged to its previous all-time high of $11.55, the cryptocurrency has faced notable challenges. First, DOT has dropped sharply to a low of $5.80 since then. After recovering from this low, DOT has been trading in a narrow range between $6.40 and $7.50 since April 14.Polkadot is often referred to as one of the "sleeping giants" among major altcoins. Analyst Michael van de Poppe has identified strong indicators suggesting potential upward movement. However, the current technical indicators provide a mixed outlook. The moving averages for DOT currently signal a sell. Similarly, RSI stands at 38, placing it in the "neutral" zone. This suggests that while DOT is not currently overbought or oversold, it may be some weeks away from a significant rebound.

Bitcoin’s Low Volume Signals Potential Rally In Lower Timeframe - Coin Edition


							

Rapha Zagury has observed that BTC is stuck in a range.
Historical data shows that low-volume periods for Bitcoin led to upside rallies.
Bitcoin is hovering around an all-time high (ATH), making investors anxious.




Swan’s Chief Investment Officer (CIO) Rapha Zagury has observed that BTC is in a range. In a recent post on X, Zagury used Bitcoin’s low-volume state to analyze its situation and predict what could happen soon. Zagury revisited his analysis of the flagship cryptocurrency when it was in a similar situation.







In July 2020, Zagury showed that a low-volume period for Bitcoin led to an upside rally. He showed how Bitcoin rallied in 30 days following a month of significantly low trading volumes. For context, the renowned analyst considered a trading volume below 30% low for BTC.









Meanwhile, the Swan CIO revealed that Bitcoin’s current 15-day rolling volatility number is 23%, significantly lower than the value in July 2020. According to Zagury, the BTC 15-day volume is in the bottom six occurrences for volume in the digital asset’s history.



The analyst categorized the pattern of occurrences after Bitcoin’s low-volume periods. He showed that the pioneer cryptocurrency returned an average gain of 20.95% in 30 days, following a typical low-volume period. The minimum return for this period is -30.06%, while BTC could deliver a 218.40% profit.



By extending the projection to 90 days, Zagury highlighted that Bitcoin’s average return under such situation is 56.82%, with a minimum return of -45.26%, while the maximum 90-day return after a low-volume period is 388.60%.



Extending the timeline to 365 days, the Swan CIO showed that Bitcoin made an average return of 820.82%. He also revealed that the minimum return over one year was -55.59%, while it gained 8,087% as a maximum return following periods of low trading volume.



Despite acknowledging that Bitcoin is a hard asset to HODL, Zagury noted that hovering around the all-time high (ATH) makes investors anxious. However, he hinted that most BTC returns after low-volume periods concentrate on lower timeframes.

Here’s how a crypto trader scooped $2.5M profit in less than a day


    The cryptocurrency market remains volatile, heavily influenced by broader economic factors. Recent U.S. job growth data exceeded expectations, indicating the economy is coping well with higher interest rates. 



This reduces the likelihood of rate cuts, which impacts the flow of money into riskier investments like cryptocurrencies.



A crypto trader has made quite a fortune on meme coins following the decline and rebound of the wider market. 







The recent market correction saw a decline in crypto assets, prompting traders to turn to meme coins to make up for lost ground. This strategy led to one trader recording huge gains, sparking a frenzy around meme coins.



Profitable strategy amid market volatility



The continuous growth and evolution of the cryptocurrency industry have proven to be a profitable environment, as demonstrated by a recent impressive trade. 



Specifically, this investor used 15.8 SOL (around $2,558) to buy 36.77 million RNT, then sold 606,000 RNT for 165 SOL (around $26,800), leaving 36.17 million RNT worth approximately $2.4 million. 







According to Lookonchain, the lucky trader made a staggering profit from 12 meme coins. On June 7, he created a new wallet, trading 12 tokens with an impressive win rate of 83%. 



Assets bought included RNT, TOPG, and TATESOL, among others. This trend has become more notable with the meme coin frenzy popularized by Solana-based assets.



Meme Coin mania and market corrections



Last month, another trader made $657,000 from an $800 investment in just a few hours, profiting from the extraordinary gains of the asset Mother Iggy (MOTHER). Last week, meme coins plummeted along with top crypto assets following market corrections.



Memecoins price changes. Source: Santiment



The meme coin market cap stands at $57.7 billion, a modest increase of 0.19% in the past 24 hours, with trading volumes slightly above $5.5 billion.



Data from Santiment shows leading assets like Dogecoin (DOGE), Shiba Inu (SHIB), and Pepe (PEPE)  posted losses, while some tokens saw slight inflows.



Despite the recent downturn, meme coins continue to attract traders looking for quick profits. These recent success stories highlight the potential for significant gains in a volatile market, albeit with considerable risk.

Top Ethereum Contributor Makes Epic U-Turn With Unexpected Gas Fee Statement


Hayden Adams, the founder and CEO of Uniswap Labs, recently made a surprising statement about transaction fees on the ETH network. Adams, who leads the largest decentralized exchange on Ethereum, declared that users should never have to worry about "gas fees." This unexpected opinion has added a new dimension to the ongoing debate about Ethereum's high transaction costs.Adams' statement comes amid a heated discussion about the expenses associated with Ethereum transactions. Recently, artist Iggy Azalea commented on the issue, questioning how gas fees are used and expressing skepticism about their impact. Although Azalea incorrectly assumed that all fees directly benefit Ethereum's founders, her comments have once again highlighted the issue of high transaction costs. The debate over Ethereum's gas fees has become more intense with the rise of Solana, a blockchain known for its lower transaction costs. Solana's recent performance has led some to speculate about the blockchain's future and its ability to compete with more affordable alternatives.Key Ethereum developers, including co-founder Vitalik Buterin, have been addressing the gas fee problem for some time. Last month, Buterin introduced EIP-7706, a proposal aimed at optimizing transaction calldata and reducing gas usage. This proposal includes a new type of gas specifically for calldata transactions, with the goal of creating a separate fee market and making calldata more affordable.Source: DefiLlamaAmid Adams' words, Uniswap has continued to succeed, earning over $3.64 billion in total commissions to date. In the past 24 hours alone, Uniswap collected $1.62 million in fees, and over the last month, it amassed $65.95 million.

ChatGPT-4o predicts Bitcoin price ahead of June's FOMC meeting


    Bitcoin (BTC) has been trading in a tight range since February, currently at $69,370, with cryptocurrency traders eagerly awaiting the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting on June 12 to set the Federal Reserve’s interest rate target.



Historically, the FOMC meetings and interest rate decisions have significantly impacted Bitcoin‘s price. Finbold provided technical analysis and finance market projections context to ChatGPT-4o for a BTC price prediction ahead of June 12.



Within this context, OpenAI‘s flagship artificial intelligence (AI) model predicts Bitcoin will trade between $68,000 and $73,000. However, a rate cut or hints of an upcoming cut could propel BTC above its range. ChatGPT-4o forecast places the leading cryptocurrency between $73,000 and $75,000 or beyond in this unlikely economic scenario.

Bitcoin price analysis



Notably, Bitcoin has been trading in a well-defined range since late February, from $60,000 to $72,000. These prices mark key support and resistance levels for Bitcoin traders and investors.



During this time, BTC has made two brief deviations—of two days each—from the price range. One in mid-March made an all-time high at $73,805, and the other in early May flash-crashed to $56,590.



Recently, the deemed “digital gold” has kept a tighter range between $66,000 and $72,000. A prominent cryptocurrency trader believes these are ideal and high-risk entry points for BTC speculators, respectively.

Interest rate targets for June’s FOMC meeting



Interestingly, 97.8% of the finance market expects interest rates to remain uncut at 525-550 basis points (bps). On May 9, expectations were slightly less bearish, with 8.4% expecting a cut to 500-525 bps. This data is from CME FedWatch, retrieved on June 9.



Target rate probabilities for the June 12 FOMC meeting. Source: CME FedWatch



Furthermore, historical data evidences how the economic scenario changed in the last four months when Bitcoin entered its current range. In February, only 1.45% of the market expected June’s interest rates to remain at 525-550 bps.



In April, the expectation ratio was 42% to 56% for 525-550 bps and 500-525 bps, respectively, and 2% for 475-500 bps for June’s FOMC meeting.

Therefore, Bitcoin ranging could have had a direct influence from unchanged interest rate decisions from previous FOMC meetings. In this context, June’s target could continue to have a major impact on BTC’s movements. Investors and traders must be cautious this week, as analysts expect high volatility ahead of the Federal Reserve meeting.

Analytics Company Reveals the Most Powerful Cryptocurrency Exchanges - Here's Who Has the Most Liquidity and Volume - Bitcoin Sistemi


A recent study by Kaiko found that Binance is still the leader in liquidity among 43 cryptocurrency exchanges surveyed in Q2 2024.
Likiditeye göre en başarılı kripto para borsaları. (1 en iyi skor olacak şekilde)
Interestingly, Binance is followed by the South Korean exchange Upbit, which ranks 10th in this ranking due to its low activity score despite its high volume. There is only one person in the management team of the exchange.


The 10 largest cryptocurrency exchanges by average trading volume.
The exchange appears to be both the most liquid exchange and the exchange that recorded the highest trading volume on average during the three months under consideration.

The volume difference between Binance and Upbit, as well as other exchanges, is interesting. Offering twice as many assets as Upbit, Binance has a trading volume four times higher than Upbit. The diversity of assets available on Binance is probably one of the reasons why it appears as the exchange with the highest volume and liquidity in our rankings.





However, when additional factors such as governance scores are taken into account, Binance ranks third behind Coinbase and Bitstamp and appears to fall short in this regard compared to its top competitors.
In terms of market depth, LMAX ranks high due to its enterprise focus. Only 5 altcoins can be bought and sold spot on LMAX.

Base beats Ethereum in Uniswap DEX volumes: A shift coming? - AMBCrypto



Base became the protocol with the highest Uniswap’s DEX volumes, outperforming Ethereum.
Ethereum ecosystem stagnated, active addresses on the network declined.

Ethereum [ETH] has been one of the most dominant networks in crypto. However, newcomers have slowly started encroaching in the king of altcoin’s territory.
Ethereum gets overtaken
Base was one of the networks that managed to give Ethereum a run for its money in DEX (Decentralized Exchange) usage.
Per a tweet by Token Terminal, the percentage of daily active users for Uniswap [UNI] (one of the largest DEXes in the crypto space) on the Base network was 36.30%. Ethereum came in second at 23.74%.
Source: X
Ethereum’s waning popularity across various sectors can have adverse impacts on the Ethereum network. Another area where Ethereum was struggling to gain popularity was the NFT sector.
AMBCrypto’s examination of CryptoSlam’s data revealed that Bitcoin [BTC] was the most dominant network in terms of NFTs.
Ethereum was far behind in second place in terms of both sales volume and number of buyers and sellers. Polygon [MATIC] and Solana [SOL] were quickly catching up to Ethereum as well.
Popular blue chip NFT collections such as Bored Ape Yacht Club [BAYC] and Mutant Ape Yacht Club [MAYC] witnessed a massive decline in overall interest.
Floor prices and sales volumes for both the collections fell over the last few months.
Source: Crypto Slam
As a result of these factors, the activity on the Ethereum network saw a decline.
AMBCrypto’s analysis of Token Terminal’s data revealed that the daily active addresses on the Ethereum network fell by 5.8% in the last month. Due to this, revenue generated by the Ethereum network collapsed.
Source: token terminal
ETH remains unfazed
At press time, ETH was trading at $3,688.41 and its price had faced a minor correction of 0.13% in the last 24 hours.
The network growth for ETH also fell materially during this period, implying that new addresses were unwilling to buy new ETH tokens at the press time price.
The velocity at which ETH was being traded plummeted, implying the frequency at which ETH was trading at had fallen significantly.

However, as the smoke clears around Ethereum ETFs and more clarity is gained around the approval of the remaining Ethereum ETFs, things could change for the better for ETH.
As institutional money from Wall Street floats in, the potential for another uptick is probable.

Bitcoin Maximalist Samson Mow Identifies Godzilla Candle Scenario For BTC - What This Means


								Popular Bitcoin supporter Samson Mow has revealed what might be the next trigger for the price of Bitcoin as the cryptocurrency continues to trade just below its all-time high. The Bitcoin Maximalist and recently identified a ‘Godzilla candle’ potentially forming on Bitcoin’s price charts, which undoubtedly would send the cryptocurrency surging to new highs. His catalyst for the bullish projection, surprisingly, is GameStop adding Bitcoin to its treasury.

Bullish Case For Bitcoin
Bitcoin is no stranger to price surges stemming from institutional adoption from big traditional companies. With Bitcoin adoption increasing and more mainstream interest in crypto, several factors could drive the price of BTC sky-high and lead to that “Godzilla candle” rally. 
According to Mow, adoption by retail gaming retailer GameStop is the next on the list of these factors. GameStop is also not a stranger to interesting market movement. A short-squeeze in January 2021 saw the company’s shares surging over 30 times at the end of the month. 
Big players like MicroStrategy, Tesla, and Square have already put Bitcoin on their balance sheets. GameStop is already part of an extensive list of companies accepting payments in Bitcoin. However, Mow believes that a better effect would be felt if GameStop were to announce they’re adding Bitcoin to their corporate treasury. As a popular stock among younger investors, GameStop has the potential to introduce cryptocurrency to a huge new audience which could send Bitcoin prices surging.

BTCUSD trading at $69,372 on the weekly chart: TradingView.com
According to his tweet on social media platform X, Mow believes the bullish projection goes both ways if GameStop were to invest in Bitcoin. “Both $GME and $BTC will see Godzilla candles immediately,” Mow said. This was probably made in reference to the recent decline in GameStop shares after the company’s financial reports revealed a $32.3 million loss in the first quarter of 2024. This revelation saw the company’s share price falling over 39% on Friday.


What’s Next For Bitcoin?
At the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading at $69,310 after spending a majority of last week trading a little above $70,000. This comes off of a change into bullish investor sentiment, with on-chain data revealing over $1.57 billion worth of BTC withdrawn from crypto exchanges during the week.

GameStop’s bullish Bitcoin thesis was also recently reiterated by financier Anthony Scaramucci on social media platform X. Overall, while a Godzilla candle would likely lead to short term volatility, it paves the way for Bitcoin to reach a new plateau of stability at a higher price level above its current all-time high.

Michael Saylor, the chairman of MicroStrategy and a prominent advocate for Bitcoin, recently made a compelling statement about the pseudonymous creator of Bitcoin, Satoshi Nakamoto.In a tweet, Saylor invoked the spirit of Satoshi, declaring that "Satoshi started a fire in cyberspace."Speaking metaphorically, Saylor describes Satoshi's creation of Bitcoin as starting a "fire in cyberspace," highlighting the revolutionary impact of this digital asset on the world. Satoshi Nakamoto, whose true identity remains a mystery, released the Bitcoin whitepaper in 2008 and mined the first block of the Bitcoin blockchain in 2009.Satoshi's vision was to create a decentralized, peer-to-peer electronic cash system that operates independently of central authorities. This vision has since evolved into a global phenomenon, with Bitcoin leading the charge in the cryptocurrency revolution.The "fire" Saylor refers to might mean the spark of innovation that has ignited a global movement toward decentralized finance. Satoshi's Bitcoin creation has undoubtedly ignited a transformative force in the digital world, reshaping how we think about money, value and decentralization.Bitcoin price actionBitcoin climbed in the past week to within 2.5% of the all-time high of $73,798 set in mid-March fueled by rising demand for exchange-traded funds (ETFs). At the time of writing, Bitcoin traded at $69,711, up almost 161% yearly.This year's boom accelerated after the Securities and Exchange Commission allowed ETFs that invest directly in Bitcoin in January. In May, the regulator took a step toward authorizing comparable spot Ethereum ETFs.As Bitcoin weighs its next price move, Ali, a crypto analyst, noted that it is anchored in a strong support zone between $69,380 and $67,350. This is where 1.97 million addresses acquired 964,000 BTC, and holding this level might be crucial for BTC to sustain its upward momentum.In a bullish undertone, Ali reported that approximately 22,647 BTC, worth over $1.57 billion, were recently withdrawn from crypto exchanges.

Demand Growth for Bitcoin Surges: What Does This Mean?


																Analysts at market intelligence platform CryptoQuant have identified a surge in demand for bitcoin (BTC) from large investors and permanent holders. While this could mean many things for the crypto industry, it is deemed a positive sign per the laws of demand and supply.
In the latest CryptoQuant weekly report, market experts said that accelerating BTC demand growth is necessary for a sustainable price rally. Hence, BTC may soon witness a substantial increase in prices.
Bitcoin Demand Growth Accelerates
CryptoQuant found that selling pressure from BTC traders has declined as they are done with taking profits. Currently, unrealized profit margins are hovering around 3%, compared to 69% in early March, and analysts expect much lower selling pressure from traders for now.
While selling pressure stays low, demand is on the rise. The acceleration in the demand for BTC is evident in the recovery of inflows into the United States spot Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) market.
These investment vehicles have been on a 19-day inflow streak since mid-May, and recently, they have recorded hundreds of millions of dollars in inflows. CryptoQuant said the total holdings of the ETFs have grown from 819,000 on May 1st to more than 859,000.




Bitcoin whales are not left out of the demand wave, as they have added over $1 billion to the network. This cohort of investors is experiencing a monthly demand growth rate of 4.4%, their fastest since mid-April.
The current activity of Bitcoin whales is similar to their on-chain movement in 2020 before BTC surged from $10,000 to $70,000. At the time, BTC hovered around $10,000 for six months with high on-chain activity, later identified as over-the-counter deals.
No Rally Underpinned Yet
Furthermore, permanent BTC holders have amassed over 70,000 in the last 30 days, recording their largest increase since late April. The uptick in demand from these market participants often correlates with higher prices.
Interestingly, demand for ether (ETH) is experiencing the same level of growth as BTC, especially since the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission approved the launch of spot Ethereum ETFs. The daily purchases of permanent holders and the growth in total holdings of ETH investors have increased significantly.
However, CryptoQuant analysts could not underpin a price rally for either BTC or ETH because stablecoin liquidity has yet to recover its growth trajectory. A surge in stablecoin liquidity usually accompanies market rallies.

New York Attorney General Sues Two Crypto Companies for Alleged $1,000,000,000 Pyramid Scheme - The Daily Hodl


								The Attorney General of New York is suing two crypto firms for their alleged role in a $1 billion pyramid scheme.
In a new press release, New York AG Letitia James announces a lawsuit against crypto exchange NovaTech and crypto mining company AWS Mining for allegedly defrauding hundreds of thousands of customers, 11,000 of which were New Yorkers.










According to the lawsuit, between 2019 and 2023, the firms allegedly used prayer groups, social media platforms and WhatsApp chats to promise high returns on investments.
However, an investigation found that out of the $1 billion they collected, only $26 million was being used to trade digital assets over NovaTech’s crypto exchange.
As stated by James,
“Thousands of New Yorkers were falsely promised better lives if they simply trusted NovaTech and AWS Mining with their money, but it was all a lie. These cryptocurrency companies targeted immigrant and religious communities with promises of financial freedom but instead stole their money and drained their life savings. 
We are seeing the real dangers of unregulated cryptocurrency platforms with schemes like these, but New Yorkers can rest assured that we will use the tools at our disposal to crack down on crypto fraudsters.”
AWS Mining – which promised investors high returns by mining crypto assets – fell apart in 2019 after failing to earn enough funds to repay customers while NovaTech, which made up weekly payments to cover its tracks, collapsed in 2023, leaving users unable to withdraw their funds.
James’ lawsuit seeks to ban both firms and its founders from engaging in any business related to securities or commodities in New York as well as disgorgement and damages, according to the press release.

Here's when XRP will hit $5, according to ChatGPT-4o


    XRP has frequently faced criticism for its perceived dormancy in the cryptocurrency market, notably for its inability to reclaim the $1 mark, raising questions about the token’s long-term sustainability.



XRP investors anticipate when the cryptocurrency might breach critical levels, such as $5, aligning its performance with peers like Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH).



In this context, OpenAI’s most advanced artificial intelligence (AI) tool, ChatGPT-4o, provided insights into potential timelines for XRP trading at $5. The AI platform provided projections based on historical data, market trends, and potential catalysts.







Catalyst behind XRP’s push to $5



ChatGPT-4o acknowledged that historically, XRP reached its peak of approximately $3.84 in January 2018 but has since experienced notable volatility without revisiting such highs. 



Regulatory developments, particularly the outcome of the Securities Exchange Commission (SEC) lawsuit against Ripple Labs, significantly influence XRP’s price. ChatGPT-4o noted that a favorable resolution could instill confidence among investors and drive the price upward.



Furthermore, increased adoption of Ripple’s technology by financial institutions and broader utilization of XRP as a bridge currency could positively impact its price. Market trends, often influenced by Bitcoin’s performance, play a pivotal role in shaping the trajectory of altcoins like XRP.



When will XRP hit $5?



Assuming favorable regulatory outcomes, heightened adoption rates, and a bullish market trend, ChatGPT-4o suggested that XRP could potentially achieve the $5 mark during the next major bull run, which historically occurs every three to four years. Considering these factors and the current market landscape, it appears plausible to anticipate XRP hitting $5 around the year 2025 or 2026, provided favorable conditions persist.

In addition to the elements highlighted by the AI tool, analysts maintain a bullish stance on XRP’s prospects. For instance, a crypto analyst by the pseudonym leb_crypto, in an X post, urged investors to respect XRP’s current trajectory, noting its potential for a bullish breakout. 



The analyst highlighted key price levels to monitor, indicating a bullish trend if XRP reclaims $0.75, neutrality at $0.45, and potential bearishness if it loses the $0.45 support.

Moreover, anticipation surrounds the possibility of a spot XRP exchange-traded fund (ETF) and a Ripple stablecoin launch, which would serve as bullish catalysts for the token.



XRP price analysis



At the time of reporting, XRP was trading at $0.50, showing signs of recovery from the flash crash experienced on June 7. Over the past 24 hours, XRP has seen nearly a 1% increase, while on the weekly chart, the token has declined by almost 4%.

In the meantime, for XRP to reach $5, the token needs to reclaim $1, as any sustained bullish momentum hinges on this price level.

Bitcoin ETFs Thrive Despite Hedge Funds' Growing Short Bets


Hedge funds are ramping up their short positions against Bitcoin on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME), even as spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) enjoy a 19-day streak of inflows.
According to Zerohedge, the Commodities Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) Commitments of Traders (COT) report revealed a significant increase and a new record high in Bitcoin hedge fund net shorts.
Are Hedge Funds Bearish on Bitcoin?

The data shows hedge funds increased their net short positions in CME standard Bitcoin futures contracts. These positions reached a record high of 18,175 contracts. These contracts, sized at 5 BTC each, are part of a trading strategy in which traders sell futures contracts to profit from anticipated drops in the underlying asset’s price.

Sina G, the co-founder of BTC-focused 21st Capital, suggested that these record short positions may indicate hedge funds’ interest in the carry trade strategy. Carry traders typically short futures while concurrently buying the asset, aiming to exploit the price differences between the spot and futures markets.

“These are more speculative positions and could indicate a carry trade where the hedge fund is long Bitcoin elsewhere. But asset managers hold the opposite position. These positions are less speculative and longer-term,” Sina G remarked.

Interestingly, these record short positions coincide with a 19-day streak of inflows into Bitcoin ETFs. During the last three weeks, the ETFs saw over $2 billion in inflows. However, despite this substantial influx, Bitcoin’s price failed to reach its March all-time high of $73,835. Instead, it registered a modest 2% gain in the last seven days.

This BTC’s subdued price performance has left many investors puzzled. However, market experts explained that this trend is due to major financial institutions purchasing Bitcoin ETFs and simultaneously selling futures to capitalize on the price difference. This resulted in significant ETF inflows with minimal impact on Bitcoin’s spot price.

Nonetheless, Samson Mow, CEO of JAN3, is convinced that “all Bitcoin shorts will eventually close, either willingly or unwillingly.”

Crypto hiring: Firms add TradFi veterans to executive ranks - Blockworks


A digital asset market maker and a crypto liquidity provider have added TradFi veterans to their executive ranks.
Belgium-based Keyrock named Robert Valdes-Rodriguez its chief commercial officer and Francesco Adiliberti as chief operating officer. 
The TradFi veterans have decades of combined experience at some of the largest financial institutions. Prior to working as Abra’s global head of sales, Valdes-Rodriguez held foreign exchange sales roles at Crédit Agricole and Scotiabank. Before his time at Amber Group Adiliberti held director positions at Lehman Brothers, Goldman Sachs and HSBC.
Keyrock CEO Kevin de Patoul said in a statement that the appointments come as the company seeks to focus more on bridging the gap between crypto and TradFi. 
“Their extensive experience across both domains will be instrumental in developing innovative solutions that empower institutions to seamlessly integrate and thrive in the rapidly evolving token economy,” he added.
A former Goldman Sachs pro has joined crypto liquidity provider B2C2 — joining the company’s sales team focused on Europe, the Middle East and Africa. 
Nickolay Karpenko, who spent roughly seven years at Goldman Sachs, was most recently an executive director on the firm’s digital assets team.
“With 15 years in investment banking, Nikolay brings deep expertise in structured products and strategic trading,” B2C2 said in a LinkedIn post. “His arrival highlights our commitment to client experience and expanding our presence.”
The EMEA hire comes after B2C2 acquired Paris-based market maker Woorton last year, allowing the company to facilitate crypto trading across the EU.
As some crypto firms bring in execs with TradFi backgrounds, the opposite is true too.
Though by no means a stranger to crypto, State Street is better known as one of the world’s largest custodian banks and asset managers. The company is looking to build out its digital assets-focused unit, job postings indicate. 
The expected hires were first reported by The Information.
Read more: State Street Sees ‘Significant Opportunity’ in Tokenization
State Street is seeking, for example, a head of digital assets solutions that would be “a strategic and creative thought leader with a deep understanding of digital asset technology and extensive institutional experience,” one job listing notes.
The ideal candidate will have a track record developing and implementing products and services related to blockchain tech, smart contracts, tokenization, wallet technologies and cryptocurrencies, it adds.  
Other postings indicate State Street is also looking for three product managers to help lead digital services in the EMEA region, as well as a business risk and digital asset controls executive.
The company did not immediately return a request for comment about these postings.

Buy signal for 2 oversold cryptocurrencies this week


    The cryptocurrency market experienced volatile trading last week, starting on a high note only to reverse course by week’s end. Initially, optimism surged as several analysts predicted Bitcoin (BTC) would reach new highs.



However, the release of robust U.S. job data on Friday altered the sentiment, hinting at a hawkish stance by the Federal Reserve.



This downturn has led to many cryptocurrencies becoming oversold, potentially signaling a “buy the dip” opportunity.







In this dramatic shift, the crypto landscape turned from bullish to bearish within days. The overall Relative Strength Index (RSI) supports this transition, with an average 4-hour RSI of 34.47, according to CoinGlass.



Against this backdrop, Finbold has identified two short-term oversold cryptocurrencies worth considering during this market crash. 



Dogwifhat (WIF)



Dogwifhat (WIF) shows strong potential as a buy opportunity. The 4-hour RSI is 28.92, while the 24-hour RSI is 41.43. These indicators suggest that WIF is oversold in the short term but shows signs of stability over the daily timeframe. 



Crypto market daily RSI heatmap, WIF. Source: CoinGlass



This RSI pattern indicates a potential rebound as the immediate selling pressure eases, and the asset could correct upwards.



Additionally, the 1-week RSI of 50  suggests a neutral long-term trend, indicating that the recent downturn may be a short-term correction rather than a prolonged bearish trend. 



At the current price of $2.60, WIF has seen a 0.64% decrease in the last 24 hours, reinforcing its status as an oversold asset with potential for recovery.



Chainlink (LINK)



Chainlink (LINK) also presents a compelling case as an oversold cryptocurrency ready for a potential rebound. 



The 4-hour RSI of 29.51 indicates an immediate oversold condition, suggesting that the recent selling pressure has been excessive. 



Crypto market daily RSI heatmap,LINK. Source: CoinGlass



With a 12-hour RSI of 34.38 and a 24-hour RSI of 42.20, LINK shows signs of stabilization over the daily timeframe, reinforcing the potential for short-term recovery. 



The 1-week RSI of 50.00 suggests a neutral long-term trend, similar to WIF, indicating that the recent downturn is likely a short-term correction. 



Currently trading at $15.5, LINK’s RSI indicators collectively point towards a potential rebound opportunity.



For a week-long investment perspective, WIF and LINK show promising buy signals based on their RSI indicators. Nevertheless, having an oversold RSI status does not guarantee price recovery and could also indicate a bearish trend



Cryptocurrencies are highly volatile assets, and everything can change in the blink of an eye.

231 Billion PEPE Withdrawal Stuns Major US Exchange: Bullish?

On Sunday morning, an unknown cryptocurrency whale bought 231.6 billion PEPE tokens from Kraken, valued at about $2.9 million. This recent purchase adds to the whale's total holdings of 750.34 billion PEPE, amounting to $8.34 million since mid-March, reports Lookonchain.PEPE, a meme cryptocurrency inspired by a famous cartoon frog, has been a hot topic since its debut last May. The token has seen substantial buying and selling activity from various investors, including the biggest one. A year later, the trend continues with major transactions still making headlines.The whale's recent investment indicates a strong belief in PEPE's potential for further growth. This is notable given the token's already impressive gains. The speculation is that this whale expects more upward movement, possibly driven by bullish market trends. Despite a volatile market, the recent whale activity suggests a positive outlook for PEPE on their behalf. The token is currently trading at $0.000013 per token, which is 40% below its all-time high but still up by an impressive 1,040% from the start of the year.PEPE to USD by CoinMarketCapInterestingly, PEPE often moves in sync with Ethereum (ETH), making it a potential indicator for ETH's performance. This unique relationship adds another layer of interest for popular meme cryptocurrency.Overall, the large purchase of PEPE from the major U.S. exchange is a notable event in the cryptocurrency market, suggesting a bullish outlook for the meme-based token. Enthusiasts better be watching closely to see if this whale's bet pays off.

Bullish: Bitcoin network activity breaks a 3-month downtrend


    The Bitcoin (BTC) network activity was in a downtrend, as evidenced by the daily active addresses count dropping since March. However, a recovery in this metric suggests a refreshed interest in using Bitcoin, which could fuel the demand for BTC.



In particular, Ali Martinez, a known on-chain analyst, spotted the daily active addresses downtrend breakout on June 8 on Santiment. Martinez highlighted the 765,480 Bitcoin addresses that turned active in the last 24 hours of posting.



According to the analyst, this is a positive sign that suggests a bull run continuation.











Other Bitcoin network activity metrics



The ongoing drop in Bitcoin network activity also appears in other metrics. For example, Finbold reported an all-time low on-chain transaction volume and yearly low spot trading volume for the leading cryptocurrency.



Year-over-year BTC chart: Price, trading volume, transaction volume. Source: Santiment / Finbold (Vini Barbosa, Sanbase Pro)



So far, these metrics have not broken down from the downtrend registered by Santiment‘s data.



On the other hand, Bitcoin transaction fees reached a new all-time high of $195 on June 8. Notably, the spike happened concomitantly to the network activity increase reported by Martinez.



Bitcoin block height 847015 and 144-block reward stats. Source: mempool.space / Finbold



It is possible that both occurrences are related, as more addresses turning active on the same day increases competition for the limited available block space, causing competition among users that outbid each other to have their transactions confirmed.



Bullish signal as exchange reserves are in a downtrend



In addition, Finbold looked for complementary data to the increased network activity through the daily active addresses count. Essentially, understanding if these active addresses have sent BTC to exchanges is crucial to establishing a bearish or bullish signal.



On that note, the exchange reserves are currently at their lowest levels, as observed in the following chart. Cryptocurrency exchanges currently hold 954,000 BTC, indicating investors are buying and withdrawing Bitcoin—a bullish signal, as stated by Martinez.

Nevertheless, cryptocurrencies, stocks, and the overall finance market await the FOMC meeting on June 12 to draw further conclusions. Analysts expect a highly volatile week ahead of the interest rate target decision, which can affect Bitcoin.

Arbitrum Foundation Wins $215M Ecosystem Funds Proposal With 75% Majority - Coin Edition


							

Arbitrum DAO has approved a proposal by the Foundation to distribute 255 million ARB tokens.
The proposal aims to boost the gaming ecosystem within the Arbitrum network.
Arbitrum network.75% of the Arbitrum community voted in favor of the proposal, including L2Beat and Wintermute.




Arbitrum DAO has approved a recent proposal by the Arbitrum Foundation to distribute 255 million ARB tokens, equivalent to $215 million, within three years. According to reports, the proposal aims to boost the gaming ecosystem within the Arbitrum network, targeting developers and potential gamers.







According to the approved proposal, the Arbitrum Foundation will dispense the allocated funds via a newly created Gaming Catalyst Program (GCP), designed to “immediately expand awareness and adoption of Arbitrum/Orbit/Stylus by builders and players in the Gaming community.”



It is worth noting that renowned organizations like L2Beat, Wintermute, and gaming-focused Treasure DAO supported the proposal and formed part of the 75% majority that voted for it. However, Blockworks Research and Camelot DAO numbered among those who voted against it. 









Emphasizing support for the proposal, Treasure DAO posted via its official X account, noting that Arbitrum is the home of gaming. It continued by explaining that Arbitrum’s coverage includes all the games, the gaming chains, and all the builders within its orbit.



Reportedly, the bulk of the allocated funds would go to game publishers. However, new and early-stage developers will get the chance to apply for grants worth up to 500,000 ARB, equivalent to $483,000 at the current price. Meanwhile, more established developers wishing to apply for investments must do so with a value share component through tokens, equity, or similar means.



The proposal explained that Arbitrum would channel the remaining funds to infrastructure-related bounties and operational expenses. A dedicated GCP team will oversee the day-to-day operational procedures while supervised by a council of “5 individuals with deep gaming, venture experience, analytics/reporting, and/or DAO governance skills.”



Arbitrum DAO will elect the council members, empowering them to veto investment decisions and team member appointments.

DeFi Total Value Locked Blasts Off to $192,000,000, Records Best Performance in 15 Months: DappRadar - The Daily Hodl


								New data from market intelligence firm DappRadar reveals that the total value locked (TVL) within the decentralized finance (DeFi) sector has skyrocketed to the highest level in 15 months.
In a new blog post, DappRadar notes that DeFi’s TVL has reached $192 billion, a 17% rise from the previous month and the best it has registered since February 2022.










TVL refers to the amount of capital deposited within a protocol’s smart contracts and is often used to gauge the health of a crypto ecosystem.
According to the crypto analytics firm, the majority of the growth was driven by an increase in token prices, particularly those of smart contract platforms Ethereum (ETH) and Solana (SOL).
 “Ethereum holds the bigger portion of the whole DeFi’s TVL, and this month its dominance is at 68%. Followed by Solana, which in the past months has been propelled by memecoin trading and DeFi activity on its network. Moreover, the native SOL token has surged by 11% in the past 30 days.”
Source: DappRadar/X
ETH is trading for $3,692 at time of writing while SOL is worth $158.94.
DappRadar goes on to note that Bitcoin’s (BTC) layer-2 solution Merlin Chain (MERL) also greatly contributed in May, becoming the crypto king’s largest sidechain, dwarfing the Lightning Network.
“The narrative around the Layer-2 networks continues to be strong, but the real top performer this month has been Merlin. It has become the largest Bitcoin sidechain and more than three times as large as the payments-focused Lightning Network.
 More than half of Merlin’s $1 billion is held in Solv Finance, a protocol that allows users to deposit Wrapped Bitcoin and receive ‘Solv Points’ in return.”
Source: DappRadar/X
MERL is trading for $0.441 at time of writing, an 10.10% decrease during the last 24 hours.

Opportunity? Bitcoin whales open 'massive long positions' at $69,000


    With Bitcoin (BTC) failing to make notable moves in either direction, on-chain data suggests that investors might be anticipating a pump in the cryptocurrency’s price.



Particularly, according to Ki Young Ju, founder of crypto analysis platform CryptoQuant, Bitcoin whales have opened massive long positions at the $69,000 mark, signaling potential bullish sentiment. 



This move indicates confidence among large investors in Bitcoin’s future price trajectory amid the ongoing consolidation.

Data shared by another analyst, Ali Martinez, supports this optimistic outlook. In an X post on June 7, Martinez highlighted a spike in the ‘Bitcoin Taker Buy Sell Ratio’ on the HTX cryptocurrency exchange. 



The ratio soared to 730, indicating overwhelming buy pressure and strong bullish sentiment among traders. This surge in buying activity suggests a potential upward movement in Bitcoin’s price in the near term.

Surge in whale activity 



Notably, the data comes in the wake of a report by CryptoQuant, which identified a surge in demand for Bitcoin from whales and permanent holders. The report noted that accelerating demand growth is necessary for a sustainable price rally, implying that Bitcoin might soon experience a price increase.



It is worth noting that the current activity of Bitcoin whales mirrors their movements in 2020, just before the asset rallied from $10,000 to above $60,000. Back then, BTC hovered around $10,000 for six months, marked by over-the-counter deals.



Additionally, as reported by Finbold, Martinez identified a breakout in the daily active addresses trend on Santiment. On June 8, Martinez observed a significant uptick, with 765,480 Bitcoin addresses becoming active within the last 24 hours. 



This surge in active addresses is interpreted as a positive sign, suggesting a continuation of the cryptocurrency market’s bull run.



Bitcoin eyes breaching $70,000



Currently, Bitcoin is eyeing the $70,000 resistance level. Earlier in the week, the asset failed to hold this position after rising as high as $71,000. 



Despite this, the consensus appears that the ongoing bull run is far from over. As reported by Finbold, crypto trading analyst TradingShot pointed out that Bitcoin has the potential to rally, advising investors to look out for potential buying opportunities within the range of the 50-day moving average (MA50).



Meanwhile, as of press time, Bitcoin was valued at $69,518, gaining about 0.1% in the past 24 hours.

Real-World Asset Tokens Outshine Bitcoin and Ethereum in Performance - Coin Edition


							

Tokens in the RWA tokenization market achieved a 61.98% performance in May.
This average percentage growth outpaced Ethereum’s 26.1% and Bitcoin’s 14%.
Meanwhile, meme-based coins registered only 7% growth over the past month.




Real-world asset (RWA) tokenization has emerged as the top-performing sector in May, eclipsing the growth of stalwarts like Ethereum (ETH) and Bitcoin (BTC). 



Data from Artemis Terminal, a leading crypto analytics platform, reveals that tokens in the RWA tokenization landscape achieved a 61.98% performance over the past month. This average percentage growth outpaced Ethereum’s 26.1% and Bitcoin’s 14%.





Interestingly, tokens in the Bitcoin ecosystem performed more commendably than BTC itself, with an average growth rate of 22.2%. Native assets of centralized exchanges followed with a performance score of 12.8%. Meanwhile, meme-based coins registered only 7% growth over the past month.



Of all crypto narratives, the RWA sector stood out with a towering performance. The surge in RWA tokenization is attributed to a series of high-profile tokenizations and encouraging regulatory discussions that have occurred recently.









For instance, Galaxy Digital recently issued a multimillion-dollar loan secured by a 316-year-old Stradivarius violin, tokenized as a non-fungible token (NFT). The violin, securely held in Hong Kong, serves as collateral, offering robust security for Galaxy Digital and flexibility in asset management.



On the regulatory front, the U.S. Financial Services Committee held a hearing titled “Next Generation Infrastructure: How Tokenization of Real-World Assets Will Facilitate Efficient Markets.” 



The hearing evaluated the necessity for enhanced regulations to facilitate tokenizing real-world assets and derivative products. Prominent industry figures participated in the hearing, including Carlos Domingo, Co-founder and CEO of Securitize, and Robert Morgan, CEO of the USDF Consortium.



Additionally, the industry’s long-term outlook is optimistic, with BlackRock CEO Larry Fink expressing confidence in tokenization’s potential to revolutionize financial transactions through customized strategies and instantaneous settlements, potentially reducing settlement costs.

Crypto Whales Buy $8 Million PEPE Amid Correction


Crypto whales have shown strong interest in the Pepe (PEPE) meme coin, purchasing over $8 million worth during a price correction.
Interestingly, this acquisition comes as PEPE’s price fluctuates following its peak in late May.
Crypto Whales’ Strategic Moves in PEPE

On-chain data reveals crypto whales bought large amounts of PEPE during the weekend. On June 7, a wallet linked to investment firm Nascent acquired 447.67 billion PEPE from Binance, totaling around $5.5 million. This move made PEPE the largest asset in Nascent’s portfolio, surpassing Maker (MKR) and Tether USD (USDT), which hold $2.98 million and $973,557, respectively.

Another significant purchase occurred on June 8. An unidentified whale bought 231.64 billion PEPE worth approximately $2.9 million from Kraken. Lookonchain reported that this transaction builds on a string of purchases.

“The whale has bought a total of 750.34 billion PEPE ($8.34 million) from Kraken at an average price of $0.00001111 since March 16,” it added.

These significant purchases happened when PEPE’s price had been consolidating lately. PEPE witnessed a notable rally in late May due to renewed interest in the broader meme coin sectors, fueled by financial analyst The Roaring Kitty’s comeback.

After reaching its all-time high record at $0.00001717 on May 27, PEPE consolidated around the $0.00001490 and $0.00001340 range. However, on June 7, its price fell to $0.00001277 and momentarily dipped to $0.00001198.
According to BeInCrypto’s previous analysis, the meme coin tumbled to $0.00001277 because it failed to maintain its support at $0.00001369. PEPE now has strong support around the $0.00001218 area. Its future trajectory will depend on whether it can trade above or break below this support.
Read more: Pepe (PEPE) Price Prediction 2024/2025/2030
At the time of writing, PEPE is now trading at $0.00001246. Despite recent instability, PEPE has gained 43.1% in the last month.

Major Token Unlocks of Next Week: APT, ARB, IMX and More


Token unlock involves releasing tokens that were previously blocked under fundraising terms. Projects carefully schedule these releases to avoid market pressure and prevent a drop in token prices.

Other next-week unlocks include Moonbeam (GLMR), dYdX (DYDX), and Render (RNDR), with a total value exceeding $232.53 million.

Major Crypto Investor And Analyst Reveals Why Shiba Inu Is Destined To Make It


								Shiba Inu has grown along the years to become one of the biggest meme coins in the midst of many tokens battling in the meme coin niche. Despite what many might call its OG status, Shiba Inu is still subject to many critics who are of the notion that the cryptocurrency could lose most of its value in the coming years.

On the other hand, a crypto investor known pseudonymously as Crypto King sees the vision and potential in SHIB that the critics are missing. In response to a recent SHIB criticism, Crypto King took to social media platform X to dispel claims of Shiba Inu’s downfall while also pointing out that “OG memes like $SHIB are destined to make it.”
Major Investor Rejects Claims That SHIB Will Lose Value
Crypto King’s recent post on social media platform X is a response to a meme coin critic. According to the critic, the majority of meme coins will lose their value in the next few years, and only two or three of them will be left among the top 50 cryptocurrencies. Surprisingly, the critic believes that Shiba Inu, which is currently the second largest meme token and 11th in market cap rankings, will lose most of its $13 billion value.

In response, Crypto King said those of this school of thought are those that do not know the market yet themselves. SHIB now finds itself listed on many centralized crypto exchanges all over the world, giving many retail traders adequate exposure to the token. As a result, the investor believes SHIB is more established than many critics can think of. He also likened SHIB’s established status among meme coins to that of gold in comparison to a newly discovered crystal that’s not worth a lot.
Shiba Inu To Keep Growing
Shiba Inu is home to a vibrant community ecosystem. Team members are constantly working to provide real-world utility in order to transition from its meme coin status. Over time, the dev team has built real, practical use cases on top of this foundation. ShibaSwap and Shibarium are a few examples where SHIB provides utility.

SHIB is currently trading at $0.00002317 and has suffered a 2.84% and 6.19% loss in the past 24 hours and seven days, respectively. According to IntoTheBlock’s Global In/Out Of The Money Metric, SHIB is currently sandwiched between a 12.7 trillion SHIB resistance wall and a 37.4 trillion SHIB support wall. The cryptocurrency could go either way during the week, but a crypto analyst notes that the $0.000023 price level is generally a demand zone for SHIB.

Charles Hoskinson Defends Cardano Against 'Zombie Chain' Label


Charles Hoskinson, founder of Cardano, has voiced frustration over what he perceives as unfair media coverage of the blockchain network. 
In a recent post on X, he highlighted a disconnect between Cardano’s capabilities and its public perception.


Hoskinson pointed out that despite numerous positive developments in recent months, media outlets and crypto influencers persistently portray Cardano as a failure. He criticized this narrative, emphasizing recent ecosystem advancements, including an upcoming hard fork. Hoskinson further asserted that Cardano will continue to thrive and provide solutions.

“It’s beyond pathetic and just reflects on the low quality and low effort they put into our ecosystem. Cardano is here to stay, and it’s a juggernaut that will drag this industry kicking and screaming if it has to towards solving the real-world economic, political, and social issues we all face,” Hoskinson said.

Read more: Who Is Charles Hoskinson, the Founder of Cardano?
In response to the perceived bias, Hoskinson contemplates creating a not-for-profit media decentralized autonomous organization (DAO). Hoskinson said this DAO would focus on ensuring fair reporting within the crypto industry.
So, he initiated a poll on X to gauge community support for using the Cardano Treasury to fund the DAO. Notably, 70% of the respondents favor the move, with voting expected to end by July 13.
Meanwhile, this is not the first time Hoskinson has addressed Cardano’s critics. The blockchain has faced scrutiny for not meeting expectations compared to peers like Ethereum and Solana and complaints over its ADA token price struggles.
Earlier in the year, Forbes included Cardano in its “zombie chain” list, claiming the network’s value is primarily driven by Hoskinson’s popularity. Additionally, Cardano has seen limited adoption in decentralized finance (DeFi), with its DEX trading volume representing just 0.04% of the market.

Nevertheless, Cardano continues to highlight its technological advancements. The network is at the forefront of scaling research and development and has recently partnered with a province in Argentina to promote crypto adoption.

It is also set to undergo a major hard fork in the second half of 2024. Additionally, Input Output, the company behind Cardano, reports that developers are currently building 1,362 projects on the blockchain, which has processed approximately 92 million transactions.

CoinGecko Announces Data Breach That Exported 1,916,596 Contacts and Sent 23,723 Phishing Emails - The Daily Hodl


								CoinGecko is warning its users to be cautious when opening emails after the cryptocurrency data aggregator experienced a security breach through its third-party email platform.
In a statement, CoinGecko says that on June 5th, it detected unusual activity on its email marketing platform, GetResponse.










The firm later received confirmation that an attacker obtained and used a GetResponse employee’s login credentials to access customer accounts.
The security incident led to the exposure of user data including user names, email addresses, IP addresses, locations of email opens and other metadata such as account sign-up dates and subscription plans. CoinGecko assured though that user accounts remain secure and the passwords were not compromised.
The attacker managed to export 1,916,596 contacts from CoinGecko’s GetResponse account and used another GetResponse client’s account to send phishing emails to 23,723 emails.
CoinGecko says that it already coordinated with GetResponse to block additional email deliveries, but warns users that they may still see a surge in phishing or spam emails.
“Any email claiming to offer token airdrops by CoinGecko or GeckoTerminal are unauthorized emails sent by the attacker. We do NOT have any officially issued coins or tokens.”
CoinGecko says it is investigating the situation with GetResponse, informing affected users and reviewing its security procedures.

Major Hack Alert at an Altcoin: Certain Users' Wallets Emptied - Bitcoin Sistemi


Loopring (LRC), the zkEVM protocol built on Ethereum and boasting of having “Ethereum's most secure wallet,” announced a security breach related to its 'Guardian' two-factor authentication service.
The Guardian service allows users to identify trusted individuals or institutions in their wallets to assist with security operations, such as locking a compromised wallet or restoring the wallet if the seed phrase is lost. However, a hacker managed to bypass Loopring's own Official Guardian service and initiated recoveries on wallets with this single guardian without users' permission.


According to Loopring's website, more than half of the custodial wallets are needed to initiate transactions. Therefore, wallets that used multiple protectors or a different third-party protector were protected from the vulnerability.
Loopring shared two wallet addresses that it claimed were involved in the security breach. Blockchain data reveals that one wallet was able to withdraw approximately $5 million worth of tokens from affected wallets.






“We are actively collaborating with Mist security experts to determine how our 2FA service was compromised. To protect our users, we have temporarily suspended Guardian-related and 2FA-related operations. Following this action, the vulnerability has ended,” Loopring said in a statement. said.
Protocol also said it was working with law enforcement to track down the attacker and asked anyone with additional information about the attack to share it with them.

Solana Won’t Kill Ethereum, The "ETH Elite" Will


Evgeny Gaevoy, CEO of crypto market maker Wintermute, has recently voiced concerns about Ethereum’s (ETH) leadership.
According to Gaevoy, Ethereum’s potential downfall will not be due to technical shortcomings compared to competitors like Solana but from contradictions within its leadership.
Wintermute CEO Highlights Leadership Paradox in Ethereum

Gaevoy criticizes Ethereum’s leadership, particularly the network’s co-founder Vitalik Buterin, for their contradictory stance on capitalism and social justice. He believes Ethereum’s failure will stem from these conflicting goals rather than technical issues.

“If ETH fails in the future, it won’t be because ‘Solana is faster,’ it will be because the ETH ‘elite’ is still stuck in a massive contradiction,” he wrote on his X (Twitter) account.

Gaevoy asserts that blockchain technology fosters capitalist systems. Yet leaders like Buterin and Hayden Adams, co-founders of the Ethereum-based decentralized exchange (DEX) Uniswap, try to solve capitalism by insisting on worthy societal ends.
He believes one cannot build both a capitalist and a planned socialist system. Gaevoy prefers capitalism for its efficacy compared to socialism.
Gaevoy’s critique comes amid a broader debate sparked by Buterin’s criticism of celebrity meme coins. Buterin emphasizes that crypto projects should serve broader societal goals beyond monetization. This prompted a response from Australian singer Iggy Azalea, who launched her meme coin—Mother Iggy (MOTHER).
During a podcast, Azalea questioned Buterin’s stance on gas fees. Her remarks, showing a misunderstanding of Ethereum’s gas fees, went viral and drew ridicule from the crypto community.
The debate escalated further when Adams joined the fray. He criticized Azalea for mocking Buterin instead of constructively addressing her concerns.
Gaevoy’s comments have stirred controversy within the crypto community. While some agree with his perspective, many disagree. One community member responded to Gaevoy by pointing out that Buterin and Adams merely expressed their vision for crypto, which does not necessarily conflict with capitalist principles.

The member suggested their critiques were more about ensuring long-term sustainability and progress within the crypto space. In response to the backlash, Gaevoy offered a clarifying statement.

“To me, it’s about the primary guiding principle. If your key guiding principle is capitalism, and then you make extra steps to make it less damaging, I’m all for it. If your guiding principle is, I don’t know, ‘social justice’ or ‘only good things should be built,’ and then you attach capitalism as an afterthought, that’s what I am against,” he stated.

Nonetheless, Gaevoy’s criticism highlights the challenges ahead for Ethereum’s leaders. As Ethereum continues to evolve, the balance between economic incentives and social goals will likely remain contentious.

Cardano on Verge of "Most Significant" Milestone in Its History


Cardano, one of the leading proof-of-stake blockchain platforms, is approaching its biggest milestone to date, according to a recent social media post shared by founder Charles Hoskinson. Cardano has now reached the fifth stage of its ambitious roadmap called "Voltaire." This stage specifically focuses on turning the network into a self-sustaining ecosystem. Hoskinson believes that June will be the month that Cardano Node, the network's top-level component, reaches 9.0.The Cardano network is already Chang fork-ready, and 70% of stake pool operators (SPOs) are now supposed to install the new node. The hard fork will consist of two major upgrades. The first one will prepare the groundwork for initiating decentralized voting as well as governance actions. The second stage will finalize the introduction of various governance features that include treasury withdrawals.  With the Voltaire phase, Cardano is supposed to enhance the level of decentralization and transparency within the ecosystem. Without even a modicum of humility, Hoskinson claims that the Chang hard fork will mark the most significant milestone for "the entire industry." "Cardano will be a decentralized civilization spanning the entire world with millions of residents. We'll have the most advanced blockchain governance system, annual budgets, a treasury, and the wisdom of our entire community to guide us," he wrote on the X social media network. Earlier this month, the controversial Cardano founder also railed against cryptocurrency influencers who believe that the network lacks fundamentals. He is convinced that there is a strong disconnect between the opinions of Cardano skeptics and reality. It remains to be seen whether 2024 will end up being a strong year for Cardano. So far, ADA's performance has been rather underwhelming in 2024, with the token dropping out of the top 10 biggest coins by market capitalization.

Binance Leading Coinbase and All Other Crypto Exchanges in This Metric, According to Kaiko Analytics - The Daily Hodl


								Crypto exchange Binance is still leading the pack in more than one way, according to digital asset analytics firm Kaiko.
In a new report, Kaiko ranks the top ten crypto exchanges in terms of liquidity, putting Binance at the top of the list, followed by Bybit and Coinbase.










“Liquid exchanges offer superior trading conditions, such as reduced slippage and lower execution risk. While liquidity can be calculated in various ways, we’ve opted to develop a liquidity score for this quarter’s exchange ranking, using five metrics, including volume and market depth.
Looking at the 43 exchanges’ liquidity rankings, Binance, the world’s largest exchange, unsurprisingly takes the lead. However, Binance places third after Coinbase and Bitstamp when considering additional factors like governance scores, where it falls short compared to its top competitors.”
Source: Kaiko
The analytics firm gets its liquidity ranking from a mix of the exchanges’ trading volume, share of volume, market depth, coefficient of variation dispersion score and market quality score.
In Q1 of this year, Kaiko says that Binance had the most trading volume by a long shot.
In second place was Upbit. However, Kaiko says the Korean crypto exchange sits in last place on its overall ranking due to having less transparency than Binance.
“Looking now at the top 10 ranked exchanges for this quarter, Binance appears to be both the most liquid exchange and the one that registers the highest trading volume on average over the three months considered. Interestingly, Binance is followed by the South Korean exchange Upbit, which, despite its apparent high volume, ranks 10th overall in this ranking due to a low business score. The exchange has only one identified member of its executive team”

Wintermute CEO: "If Ethereum Collapses, It Will Collapse Because of This, Not Because of Solana" - Bitcoin Sistemi


Wintermute CEO Evgeny Gaevoy recently shared his thoughts on the future of Ethereum (ETH), stating that if ETH fails, it won't be because “Solana is faster.”
Instead, he believes the failure will come from the Ethereum “elite” being left in deep conflict.


Gaevoy noted that blockchain technology is impressively suited to creating entirely capitalist incentive-based systems. However, he suggested that many influential figures in the Ethereum community, including Vitalik Buterin and Hayden Adams, are trying to “fix capitalism.”
These people argue that the dignity of what they create depends on “whether the goal is worthwhile,” citing healthcare, open source software, art, and other socially beneficial outcomes as worthy ends, according to Gaevoy.






Gaevoy also stated that these people believed that “the best entrepreneurs in the field are motivated by positive social change” and argued that there was a paradox:
“You will either establish capitalism or planned socialism. “I'm sorry, but you can't have it both ways.”


Gaevoy states that it is a paradox to try to combine these two fundamentally different economic systems on the same platform.

What's Happening in BNB Price? "This Surge Was Evident Last Month," Analyst Says, Explains The Reason - Bitcoin Sistemi


BNB, a cryptocurrency linked to Binance and its now-imprisoned co-founder Changpeng Zhao, rose to a record high in the first week of Zhao's four-month prison sentence in the US.
This rise also underscores Zhao's position as the richest person in a US federal prison. Zhao surrendered to a California prison on Tuesday to begin a four-month prison sentence for failing to properly protect the world's largest crypto exchange from money laundering.


According to data from CoinGecko, the BNB price climbed to $717.48 on Thursday, increasing its market value to $109 billion. The token has more than doubled in price since the beginning of the year.
BNB's course also reflects Binance's own fortunes. The total value of assets on the exchange has risen from around $80 billion in early January to $125 billion today, consolidating its dominance even after an unstable period last year that culminated in the company paying a historic $4.3 billion fine to settle a case with U.S. authorities.






BNB holders receive trading fee discounts on Binance, and the token is also used to pay fees on the BNB Smart Chain, a popular blockchain among crypto applications including games and exchanges.
According to Kaiko analyst Dessislava Aubert, BNB's recent rally was foreshadowed in derivatives market trading patterns from late May; Spot demand began to increase in June, with purchases consistently outpacing sales from June 2-5.


Aubert said BNB is traded on many centralized exchanges, which “is different from other exchange tokens that are traded almost exclusively on platforms affiliated with them.” He added that Binance still accounts for 85% of BNB volume globally.

XRP ETF a Matter of 'When' Not 'If' as Ripple Aims to Ride $3 Trillion Stablecoin Market Potential ⋆ ZyCrypto

&nbsp

&nbsp
Ripple President Monica Long has reaffirmed the idea of an XRP exchange-traded fund (ETF). In a recent interview, Long told CNBC reporters that an XRP ETF would be a sensible initiative.



“If you think about it, only XRP and Bitcoin have regulatory clarity on status in the U.S. XRP has been a top 10 asset by market cap and is about the top 5 if you look at daily traded volume. So, I think that it will make a lot of sense,” she stated.



Long also predicted that digital assets will see increased institutional adoption. The Ripple exec noted that sophisticated investors are entering the crypto market through Bitcoin ETFs and tokenized assets.



Meanwhile, Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse asserted that spot XRP ETF seems “inevitable.” In his CNBC interview, Garlinghouse opined that approving spot ETFs would benefit investors who prefer portfolio diversification. He also expressed optimism about the potential success of upcoming Ethereum ETFs.



Furthermore, Ripple is venturing into the stablecoin sector, with Long projecting a launch by the end of 2024.

&nbsp



“We are working on all the things you need to do in order to bring a product like this to market,” she expressed.



She added that XRP would remain relevant even after the stablecoin’s launch, serving as a bridge asset.



Long referenced projections suggesting the stablecoin market could surpass $3 trillion in cumulative market cap within the next five years. She noted the growing demand for stablecoins, citing their convenience for accessing US dollars and facilitating payments in various global regions.



Ripple Exec Highlights Real-World Asset Tokenization and Stablecoin Initiatives at Money 20/20 Europe



Ripple’s Monica Long provided insights into the company’s recent initiatives during the Money 20/20 Europe 2024 event in Amsterdam. Long discussed the increasing interest in real-world asset (RWA) tokenization market participants and spotlighted the company’s new venture into the stablecoin market.



“Great catching up with Arjun Kharpal in beautiful Amsterdam on recent Ripple momentum, including growing demand for RWA tokenization from our custody customers and our entry to the stablecoin market,” Long stated on X.







Through collaborations, ripple is exploring RWA tokenization on the XRP Ledger (XRPL). For instance, the company has partnered with digital asset management pioneer Zoniqx tokenization services to XRPL.



Ripple’s momentum is further supported by its strategic alliances. Recently, Ripple partnered with global payments provider Clear Junction to enhance customers’ GBP and EUR payouts.

Elliptic Warns AI-Driven Crypto Crime is Only Just Begining: Report


																A recent report from blockchain intelligence firm Elliptic titled “AI-enabled crime in the cryptoasset ecosystem” has shed light on the emerging threats posed by artificial intelligence (AI) in cryptocurrency crime.
The report, supported by case studies, identifies five emerging types of AI-enabled crimes, ranging from deepfake scams to state-sponsored cyberattacks, emphasizing that these threats are still in their infancy.
AI Deepfake Scams
AI, while having the potential to significantly transform the global economy, also brings risks. According to Elliptic, threat actors are already exploiting AI for illicit activities within the cryptoasset ecosystem.
One of the report’s findings is the use of AI to create deepfakes. These highly realistic videos and images are being used by scammers to impersonate high-profile individuals such as celebrities, politicians, and industry leaders to legitimize fake projects.
“Crypto giveaway and doubling scams are increasingly using deepfake videos of crypto CEOs and celebrities to encourage victims to send funds to scam crypto addresses.”
Specific instances mentioned in the report include deepfakes targeting Ripple (XRP) and its CEO, Brad Garlinghouse, particularly following the company’s legal victory against the U.S. SEC in July 2023.




Other individuals who have been targeted by deepfake scams include Elon Musk, former Singaporean Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong, and the 7th and 8th Presidents of Taiwan, Tsai Ing-wen and Lai Ching-te.
Anne Neuberger, the U.S. Deputy National Security Advisor for Cyber and Emerging Technologies, also addressed the growing concerns about AI’s misuse. She highlighted that AI is being used not only for everyday scams but also for more sophisticated criminal activities.
“Some North Korean and other nation-state and criminal actors have been observed trying to use AI models to accelerate the creation of malicious software and identifying vulnerable systems,” Neuberger stated.
GPT Tokens and Dark Web Activities
The hype around AI has also given rise to the creation of GPT-themed tokens, which are often promoted with promises of high returns. Elliptic warns that while some of them may be legitimate, many are being promoted in amateur trading forums with false claims of official associations with AI companies like ChatGPT.
The report also reveals discussions on dark web forums about leveraging AI models to reverse-engineer crypto wallet seed phrases and bypass authentication for various services.
“Throughout numerous dark web cybercrime forums, Elliptic has identified chatter that explores the use of LLMs to reverse-engineer crypto wallet seed phrases, bypassing authentication for services such as OnlyFans, and providing alternatives to image ‘undressing’ manipulation services such as DeepNude.”
Elliptic also states that most AI-related threats in the cryptocurrency sector are still in the early stages, highlighting the importance of being vigilant and taking proactive steps to address these developing forms of crypto crime.

Bakkt Reportedly Reviewing Strategic Options Including Potential Sale | Cryptoglobe


                                
Bakkt Holdings Inc., the digital-asset marketplace launched by Intercontinental Exchange Inc. (ICE), is considering a potential sale amid a surge in crypto-related mergers and acquisitions, according to a report by Matthew Monks, David Pan, and Gillian Tan for Bloomberg. The company, based in Alpharetta, Georgia, has apparently engaged a financial advisor to explore various strategic options, including a possible breakup. According to Bloomberg, no final decision has been made, and Bakkt could decide to continue operating independently. Representatives for Bakkt declined to comment on the matter.



Launched in 2018 with significant expectations, Bakkt was introduced by ICE, the parent company of the New York Stock Exchange, in collaboration with Starbucks Corp. and Microsoft Corp., as noted by Bloomberg. Kelly Loeffler, the founding CEO, later served as a U.S. Senator from Georgia. Earlier this year, Bakkt faced the risk of being delisted from the NYSE after indicating potential challenges in continuing as a going concern, Bloomberg reported.



Bakkt offers a variety of services, including trading and custody solutions, and is considering these strategic options amid a wave of consolidation in the digital-asset sector, Bloomberg highlighted. With cryptocurrency prices nearing record highs, some companies are looking to expand, while others are still recovering from the industry’s downturn two years ago. For instance, as Bloomberg pointed out, Robinhood Markets Inc. recently announced its acquisition of the European crypto exchange Bitstamp, and Riot Platforms Inc., one of the largest Bitcoin miners, proposed taking over its rival Bitfarms.







            
            

            
            

            
            

        

The report also mentioned that having gone public through a merger with a special purpose acquisition company (SPAC) in 2021, Bakkt reported a first-quarter loss of $21 million on revenues of $855 million. Despite these financial setbacks, Bakkt continues to innovate, recently partnering with Crossover Markets to develop a crypto electronic communication network (ECN).



Bakkt holds a BitLicense from the New York State Department of Financial Services, which allows it to operate legally in New York.

Analyst Names One Undervalued Low-Cap Altcoin With Strong Narrative, Updates Outlook on FLOKI - The Daily Hodl


								A closely followed analyst says one altcoin flying under the radar may be trading well below its fair value.
Pseudonymous analyst Inmortal tells his 214,300 followers on the social media platform X that he’s long-term bullish on Mythos (MYTH).










Mythos is a multi-chain ecosystem that aims to democratize gaming for creators and players.
According to Inmortal, Mythos is undervalued based on its strong fundamentals.
“1. [Mythical Games] is the only company ever to get an NFT (non-fungible token) marketplace approved by the App Store
2. They have partnered with Pudgy Penguins. In case you have been living in a cave for the last few months it is the most respected NFT now.
3. GameFi is next to AI (artificial intelligence): the most powerful narratives of the cycle. That’s no surprise. Gaming makes $100 billion in revenue annually…
For me who wants to have a portion of my portfolio in one of the strongest narratives this cycle, MYTH is a good choice, to be honest.” 
Looking at the chart of MYTH, Inmortal says the altcoin is flashing multiple bullish signals.
“About the chart. 
> Consecutive higher lows 
> Price above 200MA (moving average) 
> Deviation setup with 200MA.” 
Source: Inmortal/X
MYTH, the 273rd largest crypto by market cap, is trading at $0.438 at time of writing.
Turning to memecoin Floki (FLOKI), Inmortal sees the altcoin breaking out and rallying to a fresh all-time high of $0.0006.
“Since the beginning of 2024, I have been saying that FLOKI would lead memecoins this cycle, and it is happening. Be ready for acceleration.” 
Source: Inmortal/X
At time of writing, FLOKI is worth $0.000281.

Bitcoin may not remain below $70K for long, here's why - AMBCrypto



Bitcoin continued to trade below $70,000.
Over 1 million addresses acquired BTC at the current price range.

Bitcoin’s [BTC] rally has stalled, and it has now fallen below the $70,000 price zone, which serves as strong support. 
However, other on-chain metrics suggested that BTC might be able to maintain this price zone and potentially spark another positive run.
Bitcoin dips below $70K
AMBCrypto’s analysis of Bitcoin’s price trend revealed a 1.97% decline on the 7th of June. This significant drop pulled its price away from the $70,000 zone.
 Before the decline, BTC experienced consecutive uptrends that brought it into the $70,000 range, suggesting it was building momentum to surpass this threshold. 
However, the decline between the 6th to the 8th of June lowered its price to around $69,300.
As of this writing, BTC was still trading in the $69,000 price range, with a slight increase to around $69,400. The chart showed that its overall trend remained positive. 
The Relative Strength Index (RSI) was above 55, which indicated a bullish trend. 
Source: TradingView
Additionally, Bitcoin was trading above its short moving average (yellow line) at press time, providing immediate support at around the $66,000 price range.
Bitcoin needs to hold steady in this zone
Bitcoin was also seeing strong support between the $69,380 and $67,350 price zones, with a significant accumulation volume in this range. 
The data showed that approximately 1.97 million addresses acquired around 964,000 BTC within this range. 
At the current price, this equates to about $67 billion spent on accumulating Bitcoin. This strong support suggests that BTC needs to hold firmly at this level to sustain any positive trend.
More BTCs leave exchanges
AMBCrypto’s analysis showed that per Bitcoin’s supply on exchanges, there was an increase in BTC withdrawals over the last few days. 
Also, according to Glassnode, between the 1st and the 8th of June, over 21,000 BTC were withdrawn from exchanges. 
On the 1st of June, the volume of BTC on exchanges was around 2.332 million. As of this writing, that volume had declined to approximately 2.311 million.
Source: Glassnode
This means that approximately $1.57 billion worth of BTC has been withdrawn from exchanges in the last week. 

Read Bitcoin’s [BTC] Price Prediction 2024-25

This is a positive signal for Bitcoin, as it suggests there is no significant influx of BTC that could crash the price across exchanges.
Consequently, Bitcoin can maintain its support level, potentially leading to a positive price trend soon.

GameStop-Themed Memecoin Spikes Again On Roaring Kitty's 'The Dark Knight' Meme Post - GameStop (NYSE:GME) - Benzinga

A new social post by controversial trader Keith Gill, known by his social media name Roaring Kitty, has injected fresh volatility into GameStop GME/USD memecoin. What Happened: The trader, who has hogged considerable positive and negative publicity in the last month, shared the opening scene from Christopher Nolan's "The Dark Knight" through his official X account Sunday evening.As has been the case, the Solana SOL/USD-based memecoin–which pays tribute to the 2021 short squeeze of GameStop Corp. GME by the legendary trader–soared 14% within minutes of the post, according to CoinMarketCap.Moreover, trading volume surged 38% to $225 million in the last 24 hoursWhy It Matters:  The trader's social posts have been invariably moving the traditional and cryptocurrency markets. Around the same time last week, Roaring Kitty's Reverse Uno Card post spurred a 3X jump in GME's value. However, the memecoin tanked 60% when the trader's much-hyped YouTube livestream last week disappointed investors, leaving them with more questions than answers. It was plausible that traders have become circumspect of Roaring Kitty and his bets, and GME’s moderate price action compared to last week seemed to lend validity to this notion. Moreover, most kitty-themed cryptocurrencies, including Kitty AI KITTY/USD, were trading in the red. Recall that these coins too made substantial gains last week on Roaring Kitty frenzy.Price Action: At the time of writing, GME was exchanging hands at $0.0208 , according to data from Benzinga Pro. Shares of GameStop traded 3.82% lower in the after-hours trading.On Friday, GameStop shares closed 39.4% lower at $28.22 during the regular session.Read Next: Dogecoin Trader Who Made $250K Spends It All On Donations, Drugs, Concerts, Tattoos…And Takes Her Last $4K To Buy More

If the bulls push Ether above the $3,840 level, the price might rise and test the $4,000 resistance. Any more gains could send Ether toward the $4,080 resistance zone.
Another Decline In ETH?
If Ethereum fails to clear the $3,740 resistance, it could continue to move down. Initial support on the downside is near $3,660. The next major support is near the $3,640 zone.
The main support sits at $3,580. A clear move below the $3,580 support might push the price toward $3,500. Any more losses might send the price toward the $3,450 level in the near term.

How Polkadot Wants to Dominate Real-World Assets Tokenization


Polkadot (DOT), a pioneering layer-0 blockchain, is making significant strides in tokenizing real-world assets (RWA).
Amid the growing buzz surrounding RWA tokenization, industry experts believe Polkadot has the potential to be a market leader. Several projects in its ecosystem also support this view.
Key Insights into Polkadot’s Role in Real-World Asset Tokenization

Polkadot’s architecture, designed for interoperability and scalability, is ideal for tokenizing assets like real estate, commodities, and intellectual property. The JAM Whitepaper (Polkadot 2.0) could further solidify Polkadot’s position in the RWA tokenization market. This initiative bridges traditional finance with the crypto economy, providing a compliant, secure, and scalable solution for asset tokenization.
Crypto analyst Michaël van de Poppe recently discussed Polkadot’s impact on the sector. He highlighted Polkadot’s Software Development Kit (SDK) as a highly popular tool in the crypto ecosystem.
Read more: RWA Tokenization: A Look at Security and Trust
The SDK allows developers to build projects with minimal investment in blockchain technology. Consequently, this ease of use facilitates RWA integration into the Polkadot network, using the SDK to establish a strong framework for asset tokenization.


“In the meantime, Polkadot has been providing some interesting RWA integrations, as the SDK has been used for those,” he noted.

Polkadot’s ecosystem includes several noteworthy projects focused on RWA tokenization. Energy Web, for instance, tokenizes green and renewable energy assets. The project aims to accelerate the energy transition by deploying open-source Web3 technologies and integrating distributed energy resources into the grid.
One standout project in Polkadot’s RWA ecosystem is Xcavate, which democratizes real estate investment and makes it more accessible to a broader audience. Using the Polkadot SDK, Xcavate automates token transfers and mitigates counterparty risks. Furthermore, the project ensures global access to early-stage real estate investments with low entry barriers.
Another significant project is the layer-1 (L1) application chain Phyken Network. Phyken focuses on bringing green and renewable energy assets on-chain, fractionalizing them, and making them accessible to millions of investors. The project employs a novel know-your-customer (KYC) mechanism using decentralized identities and institutional-grade verifiable credentials to ensure asset authenticity and ownership.
Additionally, Centrifuge, one of the most popular RWA tokenization projects within the Polkadot ecosystem, ranks seventh in market capitalization among similar projects. Centrifuge provides liquidity to small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) by enabling them to tokenize real-world assets like invoices, which can be used as collateral for financing.
Industry Insights and Future Prospects
Real-world asset tokenization involves converting tangible and intangible assets into digital tokens tradable on a blockchain. This process simplifies transactions, adds liquidity to traditionally illiquid assets, and ensures transparency and security. Therefore, industry experts believe tokenizing real-world assets is crucial for the mass adoption of blockchain technology. 

Larry Fink, CEO of BlackRock, has emphasized the potential of tokenization to revolutionize financial instruments. He envisions a future where every stock and bond has a unique identifier on a blockchain. This would allow for customized investment strategies and instantaneous settlements.
Jenny Johnson, CEO of Franklin Templeton, also highlighted the transformative potential of tokenizing real-world assets. She cited examples such as Rihanna’s NFT royalties and loyalty programs at St. Regis in Aspen.
These examples demonstrate the technology’s ability to lower entry points and operational costs. They also make professional asset management more accessible to younger investors.

Real-World Asset Tokenization Market Forecast. Source: KPMG
According to a report by KPMG, the potential to tokenize global illiquid assets is a multi-trillion-dollar opportunity. The market is expected to grow significantly by 2030, with forecasts suggesting an increase from the 2023 baseline by at least 28 to 80 times. Expanding adoption and positive regulatory discussions will also further drive this growth.

Ethereum's sentiment takes a hit after ETF nod, but it's not all bad news! - AMBCrypto



Ethereum’s funding rate has remained positive despite recent declines.
The ETH trend has also remained bullish despite the price declines.

After the news of the Ethereum [ETH] spot ETF approval subsided, its weighted sentiment declined as well. Despite this decline, other metrics suggest that Ethereum might be poised for a positive run once spot trading resumes.
Ethereum’s sentiment and social volume declines
An analysis of the Santiment sentiment chart showed a decline in Ethereum’s sentiment. The chart indicated that weighted sentiment spiked to over 6% on the 20th and 21st of May. 
It then briefly declined to around 2% before spiking over 6% again on 23rd May. This spike coincided with the news of the ETH spot ETF approval, reflecting heightened conversation and sentiment during that period.
However, after that spike, there have been declines in the weighted sentiment, which has now turned negative. As of this writing, the weighted sentiment is around -0.4.
 This indicates that negative sentiment now outweighs the positive sentiment that Ethereum enjoyed a few weeks ago.
Source: Santiment
Additionally, an analysis of the social volume showed spikes corresponding to the increases in weighted sentiment. The chart indicated that social volume surged to 4,197 during those periods. 
However, similar to the weighted sentiment, it has since declined significantly. As of this writing, the social volume was around 415.
Ethereum’s trend of new addresses continue
An analysis of the new addresses chart on Glassnode revealed that new addresses have continued to flow in despite the weak sentiment. As of this writing, the number of new addresses exceeds 105,000. 
Source: Glassnode
Although there were declines at the beginning of the month, an uptrend is now evident. This indicates that more addresses are being created even before the spot ETH trade gets underway. 
The number of addresses could further increase once trading starts.
Ethereum remains positive on the derivative side
An analysis of Ethereum’s weighted funding rate on Coinglass showed that it has remained positive despite recent declines. 
The chart indicated that the funding rate was around 0.092% as of this writing. This suggests that buyers dominate the market, and there is a strong belief in a future rise in Ethereum’s price.

ETH sees slight increases
As of this writing, Ethereum was trading at around $3,690 after a 0.4% increase. AMBCrypto’s analysis of its daily time frame price trend showed slight increases over the last two days. 
These slight increases followed an over 3% decline on 7th June, which brought Ethereum down from the $3,800 price range.

AI Has Put a Weird New Face on an Old Amazon Prime Video Problem - Decrypt

AI has been used to put a terrifying new face to a long-running issue with Amazon’s Prime Video service.Earlier this week, a screenshot was posted on X showing a few different options for watching the iconic 1957 version of 12 Angry Men on Prime Video. At first glance, there’s nothing strange about that but on closer inspection, it’s apparent the thumbnail for the free-to-stream version of the crime classic has clearly been created by AI.Not only are there 19 angry men on the jury, but a majority of their faces are warped beyond recognition.Social media has been having a field day. “Prime Video is advertising a free version of 12 Angry Men with a crappy AI rendering of 19 deformed men. What garbage,” wrote one X user.“Just watching that classic movie on Prime Video, 19 Terrifying Men,” reads another post, that’s been viewed over 1.6million times. “Absolutely incredible that this is on the front page of a major streaming platform. We have truly entered the era of AI slop.”However rather than a bootleg copy of 12 Angry Men, the AI thumbnail takes subscribers to the original version of the film, uploaded by Orion-Nova Productions. The studio was acquired by MGM in the 90s. The second has been uploaded by MGM themselves.So why are there two versions of the same film on Amazon Prime Video, for different prices and why would a studio promote their own film with messy AI artwork?Amazon did not immediately respond to a request for comment from Decrypt.On Reddit, another user suggested that this now-viral thumbnail is the end result of content creators being allowed to upload their own videos to Amazon’s streaming service via the Video Direct function, with many looking to make a quick buck by uploading bootleg versions of classic films.“Amazon gets more 'movies' and engagement for Prime Video, and the bottomfeeders get some easy money. Everyone wins - except people who care about film quality,” they wrote.But this is nothing now. It's been a long-running issue for Prime Video, which brings together a number of different channels for its library.It seems the version of "12 Angry Men" with the original artwork can be rented directly from Amazon, while the AI-promoted film comes from the Freevee platform. Really, it’s an issue with the streamers’ search function that’s causing these issues, rather than viewers butchering classics with AI.Edited by Stacy Elliott.Generally Intelligent NewsletterA weekly AI journey narrated by Gen, a generative AI model.

Insiders Are Buying These Meme Coins


Meme coins have secured a unique position, captivating an enthusiastic community with their unpredictable fluctuations. Tracer, a DeFi analyst, recently highlighted ten meme coins that are present in various crypto insiders’ wallets. 
Tracer states these selected meme coins will likely experience substantial price increases soon.
Top 10 Insiders’ Favorite Meme Coins

Tracer himself has capitalized on following these insider transactions. He observed an insider earn 283x from early information about a meme coin named BRETT. 
Post-leak confirmation, BRETT’s value surged, marking a nearly 400% increase in just 30 days. This significant uptick enhanced BRETT’s market presence and raised its valuation from $1.66 billion to an impressive $1.92 billion. Moreover, over the weekends, BRETT achieved new all-time highs.

Tracer highlighted the meme coin PONKE, which boasts strong community support and a market cap surpassing $196 million. Meanwhile, MICHI, a meme coin that has become popular for generating thousands of meme avatars, boasts a market cap of $120.8 million.

“A meme coin whose variants you’ve seen everywhere! Meme generator Michi created thousands of avatars, which helped generate huge hype,” Tracer said.

CWIF is a deflationary meme coin valued at over $46 million. Its team conducted an airdrop for over 1.3 million holders.
Additionally, DUKO stands out with its charitable contributions and solid potential within the Solana ecosystem. SMOG has expanded from Solana to Ethereum to access a larger market. With its politically themed narrative, Super Trump (STRUMP) offers compelling tokenomics.
Lesser-known but equally promising are SLOTH, KATA, OPTI, and SOLAMA. Each brings unique attributes that could pique investor interest, especially amid rumors of potential major exchange listings.
Tracer says that listing meme coins on major exchanges like Coinbase or Binance typically triggers a 50% price surge. This is primarily due to the sudden increase in liquidity. 
This pattern has consistently generated substantial wealth for those with prior knowledge of such listings. 

The crypto ecosystem’s transparency allows tracking transactions, including those of insiders. This transparency provides savvy traders with a golden opportunity to replicate successful strategies, although it also sparks debates on the fairness of such practices.
Such insider insights provide a considerable advantage to those in the know. For example, a BeInCrypto report last year discussed a significant purchase of Dogwifhat (WIF) by a wallet labeled “binance-insider,” just before its Binance listing, igniting speculations of insider trading.

Although the allure of rapid gains is tempting, the inherent volatility of meme coins requires a strategic approach, emphasizing the importance of informed decision-making for profitability.

“Allocate your budget wisely, remember the risks, and get ready to count your profits,” Tracer said.

There is a connecting bullish trend line forming with support at $0.4950 on the hourly chart of the XRP/USD pair (data source from Kraken).
The pair could dip again if it stays below the $0.5050 resistance zone.

XRP Price Takes Hit

The next major support is at $0.4900. If there is a downside break and a close below the $0.490 level, the price might accelerate lower. In the stated case, the price could decline and retest the $0.4740 support in the near term.

Crypto Strategist Predicts Big Bitcoin Breakout in Seven to 10 Days - Here’s His Target - The Daily Hodl


								An analyst known for making contrarian crypto calls thinks that Bitcoin (BTC) is days away from igniting a big burst to the upside.
Pseudonymous analyst Credible tells his 396,100 followers on the social media platform X that Bitcoin is likely due for one last leg down before a huge breakout.










The crypto trader says BTC may fall as low as $62,000 before triggering another parabolic rally to new highs.
“Downside now limited to $60,000 (invalidation) and realistically no lower than $62,000-$63,000 (if that) with a high likelihood that this level gets front run as well. I give it about seven-10 days before we absolutely giga-send BTC. Target: $100,000+”
According to Credible, the Bitcoin rally will drive crypto traders into unloading their altcoin holdings out of fear of being left out.
“BTC prints an absolute chad of an impulse candle which is so big and strong that the collective attention of the space shifts to BTC for a period of time and liquidity begins to flow out of the 10,000,000 other alts (of which DOGE is one) and into BTC as it begins to go vertical.”
In the near term, Credible believes that Bitcoin will witness one more rally above $70,000 prior to a correction toward $64,000 and a rally to new all-time highs.
“Manifesting.” 
Source: Credible/X
At time of writing, Bitcoin is worth $69,577.

Three Things That Could Rattle Crypto Markets This Week


																All eyes are on Wednesday, June 12, which is the date of the U.S. central bank’s policy decision on interest rates.
However, the Federal Reserve is likely to keep interest rates unchanged this week, following strong jobs data for May.
Policymakers are almost certain to keep rates at the 5.25% to 5.5% range for a seventh consecutive meeting.
They could also reduce the number of cuts slated for this year as policymakers digest a mixed bag of economic data.
Economic Calendar June 10-14
June 12 will be a very busy day with core CPI (consumer price index) reports to be released. This data is a key measure of inflation in the economy, it has a significant impact on the Fed’s monetary policy decisions, including interest rate adjustments.




A higher CPI reading indicates increasing inflation, which typically puts pressure on the Fed to raise interest rates or keep them the same. The year-on-year CPI figure is likely to remain the same at 3.4%, suggesting that the central bank will not change rates this week.
There have been strong correlations between Bitcoin price and CPI data this year, as reported by CryptoPotato in May. Higher-than-expected CPI has been bearish for the digital asset, while lower-than-expected CPI has been bullish.


Thursday, June 13, will see core PPI (producer price index) reports released. This measures the average change over time in selling prices received by domestic producers of goods and services and is a valuable complimentary inflation indicator used by FOMC policymakers.
“The Fed is waiting for a string of data that strengthens its confidence that inflation is on a sustained path toward its 2% target,” said Ryan Sweet, chief US economist at Oxford Economics.
Analysts expect the first rate cut to happen at the central bank’s September policy meeting, its final gathering before the November 5 presidential election.
“It [the Fed] should project two rate cuts this year and a cutting cycle that begins in September,” Bank of America economists wrote in an investor note published on Friday.
Crypto Market Impact
The Fed rate decision is likely to be already factored into crypto markets since it is almost a given that rates will remain unchanged.
There may be a little volatility mid-week, but the sideways momentum is likely to continue. Altcoins may take a hit, however, as Bitcoin dominance remains high, keeping the premise of altseason at bay for now.
Crypto trader ‘Emperor’ shared his thoughts on the state of the market with his 390,000 followers on X on June 9.

Binance: the adoption of crypto has now passed to the “early majority”

While Binance reaches 200 million users, the CEO, Richard Teng, states that the adoption of crypto has moved from the “early adopters” to the “early majority”.

Binance: the CEO states that crypto adoption has now passed to the “early majority”
According to reports, Richard Teng, CEO of Binance, commented that crypto adoption has moved from the era of “early adopters” and has now entered the era of the “early majority”. 
Specifically, this comment refers to the latest news from the crypto-exchange of having reached 200 million customers. 

“Today we celebrate 200 million users, and all this thanks to you! Your support is the beating heart of our journey towards 1 billion users. Here are the protagonists of our story: you!”
On this subject, here are Teng’s words:
“We are deeply honored and humbled to have welcomed 200 million registered users and beyond. This achievement is an embodiment of the trust that the cryptocurrency community and industry operators continue to have in the Binance ecosystem. This milestone is not just a triumph for Binance. It is also a sign of robust growth and maturity for the broader cryptocurrency sector. … It reflects the transition from the ‘early adopters’ of cryptocurrencies to the ‘early majority’, indicating that an increasing number of people globally are approaching cryptocurrencies and their limitless possibilities”.
Binance: the goal is to reach 1 billion users with the increase in crypto adoption
Apparently, the 200 million users reached by the popular crypto-exchange Binance is, according to Teng, attributed to the changing landscape of the crypto sector. Specifically, the number of users increased from 100 to 200 million users in just 26 months. 
This is why Binance has decided not to stop at this milestone, but to set itself the new mission of reaching one billion users, thanks to the increase in crypto adoption. 
Teng continued to comment as follows:
“In the future, our attention at Binance remains focused on advancing initiatives that promote financial inclusion and innovation.”
Not only that, the CEO of Binance also refers to the regulatory situation that should become more open to the crypto sector. 
The registration in India
When talking about crypto regulation, it is easy to think of the situation in the United States, which is still in limbo, perhaps waiting for the verdict of the 2024 Presidential elections. 
However, speaking of the adoption of cryptocurrencies, there are other countries to consider, perhaps in terms of population. 
In fact, recently, Binance e KuCoin have obtained the registration from the anti-money laundering authority of India, marking a step forward for the credibility of cryptocurrencies. 
These two crypto-exchanges are the first offshore entities related to crypto to obtain registration in India.

Crypto news: BlackRock ready to apply for the ETF on Solana

According to the latest crypto news, BlackRock is ready to apply for the ETF on Solana (SOL) next month, a move that could mark an important step for the cryptocurrency and for the blockchain ecosystem in general. 
Let’s see all the details below. 

BlackRock continues to push the adoption of crypto: the ETF on Solana 
In recent years, BlackRock has shown a growing interest in the world of criptovalute. Recently, the news that the financial giant is ready to apply for an ETF on Solana has sparked a great buzz in the market.
The possible approval of an ETF on SOL, in fact, would represent a further step towards the mainstream adoption of cryptocurrencies.

Furthermore, the move towards an ETF on Solana could be seen as a strategy to diversify the offerings and attract a broader audience of investors.
Solana, with its high-speed blockchain and reduced transaction costs, has gained notable popularity among developers and investors. 
The introduction of an ETF on Solana by BlackRock could not only increase the legitimacy of this cryptocurrency, but also stimulate further investments and developments in its ecosystem.
In summary, the potential request for an ETF on Solana by BlackRock could represent a significant turning point for the cryptocurrency market, once again highlighting the growing importance of this sector in the global financial landscape.
The Bitcoin ETF by BlackRock surpasses 300,000 BTC in AUM
In the meantime, the exchange-traded fund IBIT spot of Bitcoin by BlackRock has surpassed 300,000 BTC (21 billion dollars) in assets under management, five months after the start of trading on January 11.
The Bitcoin ETF by BlackRock has now accumulated 302,534 BTC, according to its fund page, with about 4,920 BTC of net inflows yesterday that pushed it past the milestone. 
IBIT has surpassed GBTC by Grayscale in terms of asset under management (AUM) last week, capturing the product that had an advantage over the other spot Bitcoin ETFs in assets.
GBTC originally operated as a private placement fund before transitioning to public trading on the OTC market in 2015 and its final conversion to an ETF in January. 
GBTC charges a much higher fee compared to its competitors – 1.5% compared to the current 0.25% fee for IBIT by BlackRock. 
His holdings in Bitcoin post-conversion have decreased by about 54% from approximately 619,220 BTC to 285,651 BTC, according to the fund’s disclosures as of Thursday.
However, given the concurrent increase in the price of bitcoin since the launch of spot ETFs, the assets under management of GBTC in US dollars have decreased less, falling by 30% from a value of 28.7 billion dollars on January 11 to 20 billion dollars at current prices.
According to the data from CoinGlass, the combined assets held by all US spot bitcoin ETFs are now nearly 883,000 BTC (63 billion dollars), which is 4.2% of the total supply of 21 million bitcoin.
The USA Bitcoin ETFs record inflows 
Finally, in the last week, the US spot Bitcoin ETFs reached a record of net inflows for 18 consecutive days. 
Adding another 217.7 million dollars to the funds, during a week that saw almost 1.7 billion dollars of net inflows.
The IBIT of BlackRock led yesterday’s net inflows with 349.9 million dollars, while the GBTC of Grayscale recorded net outflows of 37.6 million dollars. 
Although daily inflows into spot Bitcoin ETFs have returned to record levels this week, the volume remains significantly lower than the peak of $9.9 billion on March 12, generating $1.4 billion in trades.

Why Is Bitcoin Struggling To Surpass Its All-Time Highs? Crypto Research Firm Explains - Benzinga

Bitcoin’s BTC/USD struggle to surpass its all-time highs is attributed to a slowdown in stablecoin minting following the halving event, according to cryptocurrency research firm 10x Research.What Happened: In its latest report shared Sunday, 10x Research highlighted that the Bitcoin halving event that occurred on April 20 led to a notable slowdown in the minting of stablecoins. Furthermore, wallets holding more than $10 million in stablecoins have seen a decline. This trend is currently impeding Bitcoin’s progress.Typically, a spike in stablecoin holdings indicates strong buying pressure and bullish sentiment in the market. Most traders use stablecoins to enter and exit trades on cryptocurrency exchanges. Conversely, a drop in stablecoin reserves underlines weakening demand for cryptocurrencies.Additionally, the report revealed that nearly 100,000 Bitcoin, worth $6.75 billion, were withdrawn from exchanges last month. This record-breaking movement was primarily driven by two U.S.-focused exchanges, Kraken and Coinbase, which saw withdrawals of 55,000 BTC ($3.8 billion) and 24k BTC ($1.7 billion) respectively.The sharp fall in Bitcoin’s reserves on exchanges indicated a sell-side liquidity crisis, meaning that demand was outpacing supply.Why It Matters: The latest report comes following an optimistic forecast by 10x analysts last week. A head-and-shoulders formation for Bitcoin could soon break through the resistance line, possibly pushing its price toward $83,000 in the near term, the report read.Another bullish forecast observed that Bitcoin is nearing a significant technical breakout, potentially reaching a milestone of $100,000. Maintaining levels above $70,000 could increase the likelihood of the King Crypto reaching $100,000.Price Action: At the time of writing, Bitcoin was exchanging hands at $69,542.93, rising marginally by 0.42% in the last 24 hours, according to data from Benzinga Pro. Read Next: Pepe Outperforms Crypto Market, Becomes Most-Traded Memecoin Eclipsing Dogecoin, Shiba Inu — HODLers Hopeful Of Further UpsideDisclaimer: This content was partially produced with the help of Benzinga Neuro and was reviewed and published by Benzinga editors.

Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse's Remarks Revive Dogecoin's Utility Vs Speculation Debate: 'Don't Know What The Use Case Is' - Benzinga

The world's first and arguably most popular memecoin, Dogecoin DOGE/USD has faced flak from skeptics over its speculative nature and lack of tangible use cases.What Happened: Brad Garlinghouse, CEO of Ripple, made one of the sharpest attacks on the dog-themed cryptocurrency at the Consensus 2024 event last week when he said, "I don't think Dogecoin has been a good thing for the industry."Garlinghouse questioned what the use case of the project was and what projects were being built to solve real-world problems. He argued that the long-term prospects of a project shouldn't be driven by speculation but rather by its real-world utility.Dogecoin was born out of the legendary meme on Kabosu, the Shiba Inu dog, kickstarting the trend of meme-based cryptocurrencies, which continue to be a hot market to this day.While lacking any fundamentals, the coin's movement has been largely driven by social posts and endorsements by Tesla and Space X CEO Elon Musk.Speculations of DOGE getting integrated into Musk's corporate ecosystem, including as a payment option on social platform X have gained steam from time to time, only to die down subsequently.Why It Matters:  Dogecoin has trailed its canine rival Shiba Inu SHIB in year-to-date gains, rising 61% in comparison to SHIB's 123% spike. The Shiba Inu ecosystem has tried to rise above the memecoin label over the last year, launching blockchain-based projects like layer-1 chain, Shibarium, and the decentralized exchange Shibaswap. This may have led to more confidence in the project's long-term viability. Dogecoin, on the other hand, doesn't boast of any such products.But the views of critics, including that of Garlinghouse, are in stark contrast to those of billionaire entrepreneur and Dallas Mavericks owner Mark Cuban.Cuban has been one of the most vocal proponents of DOGE and been accepting DOGE as payment for tickets and merchandise for the NBA team.Price Action: At the time of writing, DOGE was exchanging hands at $0.1454, following a 0.59% drop in the last 24 hours, according to data from Benzinga Pro. Read Next: Om!

Bitcoin Buoyed By Big Money: Whales Accumulate Heavily


			
			
				They say journalists never truly clock out. But for Christian, that's not just a metaphor, it's a lifestyle. By day, he navigates the ever-shifting tides of the cryptocurrency market, wielding words like a seasoned editor and crafting articles that decipher the jargon for the masses. When the PC goes on hibernate mode, however, his pursuits take a more mechanical (and sometimes philosophical) turn.
Christian's journey with the written word began long before the age of Bitcoin. In the hallowed halls of academia, he honed his craft as a feature writer for his college paper. This early love for storytelling paved the way for a successful stint as an editor at a data engineering firm, where his first-month essay win funded a months-long supply of doggie and kitty treats – a testament to his dedication to his furry companions (more on that later).
Christian then roamed the world of journalism, working at newspapers in Canada and even South Korea. He finally settled down at a local news giant in his hometown in the Philippines for a decade, becoming a total news junkie. But then, something new caught his eye: cryptocurrency. It was like a treasure hunt mixed with storytelling - right up his alley!
So, he landed a killer gig at NewsBTC and Bitcoinist, where he's one of the go-to guys for all things crypto. He breaks down this confusing stuff into bite-sized pieces, making it easy for anyone to understand (he salutes his management team for teaching him this skill). 
Think Christian's all work and no play? Not a chance! When he's not at his computer, you'll find him indulging his passion for motorbikes. A true gearhead, Christian loves tinkering with his bike and savoring the joy of the open road on his 320-cc Yamaha R3. Once a speed demon who hit 120mph (a feat he vowed never to repeat), he now prefers leisurely rides along the coast, enjoying the wind in his thinning hair.
Speaking of chill, Christian's got a crew of furry friends waiting for him at home. Two cats and a dog. He swears cats are way smarter than dogs (sorry, Grizzly), but he adores them all anyway. Apparently, watching his pets just chillin’ helps him analyze and write meticulously formatted articles even better.
Here's the thing about this guy: He works a lot, but he keeps himself fueled by enough coffee to make it through the day - and some seriously delicious (Filipino) food. He says a delectable meal is the secret ingredient to a killer article. And after a long day of crypto crusading, he unwinds with some rum (mixed with milk) while watching slapstick movies.
Looking ahead, Christian sees a future intertwined with NewsBTC and Bitcoinist. He says he sees himself “growing old” alongside these companies, sharing his expertise and passion with a community he values, and fellow editors - and bosses - he deeply respects. 
So, the next time you tread into the world of cryptocurrency, remember the man behind the words – the crypto crusader, the grease monkey, and the feline philosopher, all rolled into one.

Bitcoin Scores Second-Highest Close Ever: Details


Bitcoin, the leading cryptocurrency by market cap, has managed to log its second-highest weekly close to date. The crypto king ended Sunday at $69,640 after experiencing a rather volatile week. On June 7, the price of the leading cryptocurrency peaked at $71,949, its highest price point since May 21. However, it failed to crack the $72,000 resistance level due to stronger-than-expected US job gains reported in May. The strength of the labour market might prevent the Federal Reserve from lowering interest rates in the near future. Risk assets such as cryptocurrencies typically benefit from a looser monetary policy. Despite the macro-fueled headwinds, Bitcoin bulls still seem to be poised to reclaim the $70,000 level, with the largest cryptocurrency currently trading at $69,540 on the Bitstamp exchange. Massive inflows recorded by spot-based Bitcoin exchange-traded funds last week appear to be a major bullish catalyst for the market. For now, however, the cryptocurrency remains range-bound. According to Galaxy Digital CEO Mike Novogratz, it would have to surpass the $73,000 resistance level in order to be able to enter a new range and eventually surpass the $100,000 level. Bitcoin scored its highest weekly close of $71,285 in March after reaching its current all-time high of $73,794 on March 11. After that, the cryptocurrency experienced a sharp correction. On May 1, it plunged to as low as $56,500 due to the double-whammy of slowing ETF flows and stagflation concerns fueled by such big names as JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon. Even though Bitcoin has recovered, it is yet to gain a footing above the $70,000 level. As reported by U.Today, long-term Bitcoin holders distributing their acquired coins to new ETF holders might be the key reason why the bulls are not in control just yet.

If Ethereum Fails, Blame The 'ETH Elite', Not SOL: Crypto CEO


								In a recent flurry of heated exchanges on social media platform X, Evgeny Gaevoy, the founder and CEO of crypto trading powerhouse Wintermute, has sparked a notable debate concerning the future of Ethereum and its leadership. Gaevoy, in a pointed critique, suggested that potential failures in Ethereum would not stem from technological competition like Solana, but rather from ideological contradictions within its own leadership.
Will Ethereum Fail Because Of Its Ideology?
Gaevoy’s remarks followed comments from Hayden Adams, known for his pioneering work on the Uniswap protocol, who had earlier expressed his tolerance and perceived value in meme-centric cryptocurrencies, emphasizing their role in promoting social causes. “I think there’s value to memetic attention and it’s cool to create markets for it. That said, the underlying purpose and value of the tech goes way beyond financial games,” he stated.
Contrasting with Adams, Gaevoy argued, “Blockchain tech is impressively super well conductive to create purely capitalist incentive-based systems. At the same time, Vitalik [Buterin], Hayden [Adams] and many others are trying to ‘solve capitalism’ […] You are either building capitalism or planned socialism. I’m sorry, you really can’t have both.”

He added that he’ll choose “capitalism in all its (often ugly!) glory. And if you are not here for glory, then one simple argument is – unlike socialism, capitalism actually works.”
This notion sparked a broader dialogue within the crypto community, attracting comments from other industry leaders. Ari Paul, CEO of BlockTower Capital, entered the debate suggesting Gaevoy’s view represented a “false dichotomy.” Paul analogized the situation to societal norms about propriety in shared spaces, such as elevators, arguing that just because one advocates for polite behavior does not mean they reject other priorities like safety or efficiency.
Gaevoy rebutted, emphasizing that the core functionality should trump less critical social preferences. He responded to Paul with a metaphor about optimizing elevators, “So the best elevators are the ones that don’t have farting people in them?” suggesting that focusing on minor issues like elevator etiquette over more significant technical characteristics could be misplaced.
Fiskantes, co-founder of Zee Prime Capital, elaborated on this metaphor, distinguishing between expressing a preference and redesigning systems around niche issues. He argued that stating a preference against sharing an elevator with a ‘farting person’ is vastly different from redesigning the elevator to specifically include anti-fart features, potentially at the expense of more critical functionalities like safety and speed.

Furthering the discourse, Mike van Rossum of Folkvant Trading defended the intentions of Ethereum’s leaders. He highlighted that Adams and Buterin’s critiques were not against capitalism per se but against trends within the crypto space that may not be sustainable or conducive to long-term progress. Van Rossum explained, “They both have a certain vision of crypto […] they just want to say ‘I don’t like this’, and that’s pretty much all they did,” suggesting a nuanced view that accommodates both capitalist frameworks and selective ideological stances.
Gaevoy concluded the debate by clarifying his stance on the foundational principles of crypto projects. He stressed the importance of adopting capitalism not merely as an afterthought but as a central guiding principle. He asserted, “If your key guiding principle is capitalism and then you make extra steps to make it less damaging – I’m all for it. If your guiding principle is, idk, ‘social justice’ or ‘only good things should be built’ and then you attach capitalism as an afterthought, that’s what I am against.”
The debate underscores a critical junction for the crypto community, reflecting a broader ideological struggle about the direction and use of blockchain technology. As these discussions continue to unfold, they not only influence public perception but also shape the strategic decisions that will determine the future of Ethereum and similar blockchains.
At press time, ETH traded at $3,682.

Cardano Unveils Timeline for Chang Fork, Ushering in 'Age of Voltaire'


							

Charles Hoskinson remains confident of the imminent Chang fork upgrade, which will mark the beginning of a new era of Cardano’s governance.



In his recent X post, Hoskinson asserts that June will see the Cardano Node reaching 9.0.



Cardano’s Chang fork upgrade is a game-changer that pushed the ecosystem into the Age of Voltaire.




Charles Hoskinson, the founder of the Cardano blockchain, expressed confidence in a recent X post that the highly anticipated Chang fork upgrade is expected to be completed by June. 







The Cardano ecosystem has been awaiting the Chang fork upgrade for long. With the upgrade, Cardano will be pushed to the Age of Voltaire. According to the official blog post, the Voltaire era “signifies a new dawn for Cardano, where governance is decentralized, inclusive, and transparent.”



Hoskinson elaborated on the significance of the Chang fork upgrade to the entire ecosystem. He stated:




“It’s the most significant milestone in the history of Cardano and for the industry as a whole. Cardano will be a decentralized civilization spanning the entire world with millions of residents. We’ll have the most advanced blockchain governance system, annual budgets, a treasury, and the wisdom of our entire community to guide us.”




Cardano’s development team acknowledged the transformative potential of the Chang fork upgrade, calling it a “game changer” that could propel the platform to the forefront of the blockchain revolution. The upgrade represents the culmination of years of dedicated effort, community engagement, and rigorous testing.









Hoskinson shed light on nearly 10 years of efforts that led to the “remarkable journey.” He added,




“I can’t believe that in a single decade, we built a nation. I’m proud of all of you. Cardano gives me hope for our industry and the world. Let’s spend the next decade making a big dent in the universe.” 




Amidst this pivotal development, Cardano’s native cryptocurrency, ADA, experienced a modest 24-hour price increase of 1.43%, deviating from its recent downtrend. However, at its current trading price of $0.4417, ADA has still seen declines of 1.8% and 5.13% over the past week and month, respectively.

Binance With 200M Registered Users. Next Target 1 Billion...


                                Binance Celebrates 200 Million Users Amid Regulatory Challenges                                Binance CEO Richard Teng said in a recent interview that the cryptocurrency industry has now evolved from being used by ‘early adopters ‘ to being used by the ‘early majority’. This followed after Binance on 8th June revealed that it has registered more than 200 million users across the globe which makes it the most popular cryptocurrency exchange.What's the NewsTeng says that the Binance ecosystem is very grateful for this achievement as it continues to grow by adding more registered users, he said, “We are deeply honored and humbled to have reached and surpassed 200 million registered users.” According to Teng, this success is proof of the confidence that the crypto community and participants in the industry have placed in the Binance ecosystem.Another factor that can be attributed to the changes in the industry is the increased number of users of Binance exchange services, which has doubled from 100 million to 200 million within 26 months.Teng expressed that this milestone is not only a victory for Binance but also the crypto industry as a whole, as it points to the fact that the industry is maturing and growing stronger. This also means that people are no longer just experimenting with crypto, but getting more comfortable adopting it in their day-to-day lives and opening up to the potential of the technology.”Impact Of US Presidential Election 2024 On BinanceHowever, this has not made Binance rest as it continues to grow and expand its services. The company plans to reach one billion users, which will be a challenging task, as it will be necessary to attract almost as many new users as the number of current cryptocurrency owners globally.This aggressive target implies that roughly every seventh person on the planet would have to start using cryptocurrency. The realization of this goal will also be contingent on the level of political support from global regulators, particularly the United States.At the moment, roughly 50 million people in the United States own crypto, which is 10% of the global total. however, they are in a state of legal limbo while the SEC, the CFTC, and other federal agencies discuss the legal status of the various parts of the cryptocurrency ecosystem in the country.The upcoming U.S. presidential election could play a crucial role in shaping the future of crypto regulation. Donald Trump has recently declared that if elected he will be a "crypto president," which could influence the regulatory environment and potentially provide clearer guidelines for the industry.ConclusionAccording to CoinGabbar, Binance achievement of reaching 200 million users is a significant milestone. The road to onboarding one billion users will be challenging. It will require widespread adoption, regulatory clarity, and innovative initiatives to promote financial inclusion. As the cryptocurrency industry continues to grow and mature, the support of global regulators and political leaders will be crucial in determining its future trajectory. As an interesting turn of events, Donald Trump has shifted his attitude towards the crypto industry, becoming the first major party seeking the votes of the Bitcoin and crypto community. The support of the president is a big boost for the US crypto industry.Also Read: Will US Election 2024 Unlock Doors For Solana ETF Approval?

Local Top Ahead? Bitcoin's Rally May Face a Speed Bump


							

The next Bitcoin local top is expected at a price of $89,200. 



ETH addresses holding 10,000+ coins increased by 3% in the last 3 weeks.



In the past 24 hours, 765,480 BTC addresses were active, which is a positive sign.




According to crypto, stock, and real estate investor Ali Martinez, Bitcoin (BTC) may soon reach a new “local top” of $89,200; a short-term price peak that often precedes a period of consolidation or decline.







This forecast, which surpasses Bitcoin’s previous all-time high of $73,000, set in March 2024. This comes in the wake of renewed bullish sentiment in the crypto market, fueled by growing network activity and institutional interest.









Martinez further highlights a positive trend in Bitcoin’s network activity. The number of daily active Bitcoin addresses has recently broken a downtrend, with 765,480 addresses active in the past 24 hours, suggesting continued bullish momentum.







Ethereum’s network also shows positive signs. Martinez observes that the number of addresses holding 10,000 or more ETH has risen 3% in the last three weeks, indicating increased buying pressure.Interest in ETH has surged since the approval of 19b-4 applications  by the SEC in May. ETH has climbed 105.84% in the past year, compared to Bitcoin’s 169.85% increase, according to CoinMarketCap data.

Charles Hoskinson Announces Major Cardano Upgrade For June


Charles Hoskinson, the founder of Cardano (ADA), has unveiled plans for a significant update poised to transform the Cardano ecosystem. Scheduled for release in June, Cardano Node’s 9.0 version will facilitate the Chang hard fork, marking the advent of the Voltaire Age for Cardano.
The community remains curious as Cardano approaches this transformative period with its upcoming upgrades. 
68% of Cardano Holders Are at a Loss

Hoskinson has expressed optimism about Cardano’s future, highlighting its potential to become a decentralized global civilization. 
The Voltaire Age promises to revolutionize Cardano’s governance through phased enhancements. Initially, it will introduce decentralized voting as detailed in Cardano Improvement Proposal (CIP) 1694. This feature is pivotal, enabling the community to influence the ecosystem by proposing and funding new projects directly.

“It’s the most significant milestone in the history of Cardano and for the industry as a whole. Cardano will be a decentralized civilization spanning the entire world with millions of residents. We’ll have the most advanced blockchain governance system, annual budgets, a treasury, and the wisdom of our entire community to guide us,” Hoskinson said.

Moreover, the second phase will expand these capabilities, allowing for proxy participation and treasury withdrawals. Consequently, Cardano holders will gain greater control over community funds and decision-making processes, deepening their engagement with the platform’s evolution.
In anticipation of these changes, Cardano recently released node version 8.9.2. This update resolved a significant peer-sharing networking issue, strengthening the platform’s capabilities. Such improvements are crucial for maintaining network performance and scalability.
Hoskinson is also enthusiastic about the upcoming Ouroboros Leios upgrade, which aims to boost transaction efficiency and scalability. These advancements are essential for maintaining Cardano’s competitive edge in the blockchain arena, ensuring the network can manage increased transaction volumes while remaining decentralized.
Despite these significant updates, ADA’s price has shown minimal fluctuation, with only a 1% increase in the past 24 hours, currently trading at $0.4407. 
This stability is notable despite a generally bullish cryptocurrency market in 2024. Cardano has seen a nearly 30% decline in value year-to-date. Data from IntoTheBlock shows that only 32.39% of Cardano holders are currently making a profit at this price.

Nevertheless, the average ADA holder maintains their investment for about a year, indicating a strong belief in Cardano’s long-term potential. This extended holding period suggests that many are waiting for a price recovery to either break even or realize profits.
The community has also warmly received the news of the Chang Fork. Cardano investor Av Sebastian shared his excitement about the platform’s prospects.

“Everyone needs to know that after the Chang hard fork, Cardano will be the most decentralized asset in the world. All ADA holders will be able to decide how the treasury of 1.5 billion ADA is spent and also the future of Cardano,” Sebastian remarked.

Crypto Heist Heats Up: Orbit Chain Hackers on the Move with $48 Million


								Cryptocurrency investors are in a tizzy after dormant funds from the December Orbit Chain heist were spotted tumbling through Tornado Cash, a notorious blockchain anonymizer. The hack, which pilfered a staggering $48 million (now ballooned to $121 million due to market fluctuations), had gone quiet for months, leading many to believe the ill-gotten gains were gathering dust in a digital vault.









Elusive Hacker Strikes Again







Then, like a digital phantom, the hacker resurfaced, transferring nearly $50 million worth of stolen Ether to a new wallet before churning it through Tornado Cash, a service notorious for its ability to obfuscate the trail of cryptocurrency transactions. This laundering maneuver makes it extremely difficult, if not impossible, to track the stolen funds and return them to their rightful owners.







Orbit Chain Hack: Motive Unclear







The motive behind the hacker’s sudden activity remains a mystery. Some speculate it might be a response to Orbit Chain’s recent revival of certain bridging services, which allow users to transfer crypto assets between different blockchains. This could indicate the hacker is preparing to cash out, or it might simply be an attempt to further confuse investigators.












Orbit Chain themselves haven’t exactly been forthcoming with information. Despite reassurances that they’re working with authorities, the cause of the hack remains shrouded in secrecy. The protocol also hasn’t addressed user concerns about potential reimbursement, leaving many investors feeling lost in the digital ether.

This incident emphasizes the inherent vulnerabilities of DeFi platforms. Although they present an alluring picture of decentralized finance, investors may be at risk due to a lack of regulatory monitoring.
The hunt for the missing millions, now obscured by a digital smokescreen, has become significantly more complex.
Crypto Crime On The Rise
Amidst a concerning trend of increasing cryptocurrency theft, recent data shows that hackers managed to steal $540 million in digital assets during the first quarter of 2024. This marks a 42% rise compared to the same period last year. The Decentralized Finance (DeFi) industry, valued at over $100 billion in total value locked (TVL), is particularly vulnerable due to its decentralized exchanges.
A web3 bug bounty platform found that DeFi was the primary target for exploits in Q1, indicating significant security gaps compared to Centralized Finance (CeFi) platforms.

Hacks were responsible for the majority of these losses, making up 96%, while fraud accounted for only 4%. Ethereum and BNB Chain were the most targeted blockchains, with Ethereum experiencing over 30 individual attacks.

"Roaring Kitty" Keith Gill's Influence May Extend Beyond Meme Stocks to ETFs


							

Keith Gill AKA “Roaring Kitty” encouraged to launch a meme-themed ETF.



Gill’s influence could disrupt the ETF market due to his large following.



Ethereum ETFs face potential regulatory scrutiny as they gain momentum.




American financial analyst and investor Keith Gill, also known as “Roaring Kitty,” is the ideal candidate to launch an Exchange-Traded Fund (ETF) based on meme cryptocurrencies or meme stocks, according to Nate Geraci, President of the ETF Store.



In an X post, Geraci noted that Gill possesses all the requisite qualities of an ETF issuer. Gill actively manages and holds targeted meme stocks, has demonstrated a strong grasp of marketing strategy, and commands a large audience through his live streams.







Gill’s investment moves are closely followed by over half a million viewers, and the media regularly reports on his holdings. Geraci believes Gill’s popularity would allow him to charge premium fees, further solidifying his suitability as an ETF issuer in the United States.









Gill, also known as “DeepFuckingValue,” recently resurfaced on Reddit after a three-year hiatus, revealing GameStop holdings exceeding $200 million. Some X users speculate that regular posting by Gill could diminish the hype surrounding his investments.




Hype will dry down once he starts posting regularly. There was so much build up coz he came back after 3 yrs.




Geraci also commented on the possibility of Ethereum ETFs, stating that the SEC may soon review S-1 filings submitted by major asset management firms like BlackRock and Fidelity.

Charles Hockinson Breaks Silence on Biggest Event in Cardano's History


In a recent X post, Charles Hoskinson shared important updates regarding the Cardano blockchain. Particularly, the founder of Cardano stated that this month will see the release of a new node, a crucial step toward the next major hard fork, Chang.This forthcoming event is not merely a technical upgrade but a leap toward decentralized governance within the Cardano ecosystem, as was previously stated. Hoskinson outlined that for the hard fork to proceed, around 70% of ADA stake pool operators must successfully transition to the new node version.Hoskinson envisions widespread participation in the governance of Cardano, facilitated by an advanced blockchain governance system. This development has deep implications for Cardano's evolution into a decentralized global community.  The Voltaire era signifies a period of increased community involvement in shaping Cardano's future. With the introduction of delegate representatives, community members will be able to represent their interests in the governance process.Cardano goes constitutionalIn addition, the upcoming Cardano Constitutional Convention in the capital of Argentina will play a crucial role. Governance representatives from different regions will work together to draft the first Constitution, laying the foundation for decentralized governance principles.Ratification of this Constitution through a community-wide vote will underscore Cardano's path to decentralized governance and set a precedent for blockchain projects worldwide.

CEO Of Bitcoin Magazine Statement On Trump’s Crypto Campa...


                                Trump’s Campaign In Favor Of Domestic Bitcoin Mining                                David Bailey the head of Bitcoin Magazine and a campaign worker for Donald Trump, stated that the ex-president will take part in the Presidential Roundtable dedicated to Domestic Bitcoin Mining. This event can be considered a turning point in Trump’s attitude to cryptocurrencies and the positioning of his campaign in favor of pro-crypto policies.What’s The NewsThe CEO of Bitcoin Magazine, David Bailey stated through his social media pages, stressing the significance of the event as he called it historical. This roundtable is anticipated to have key stakeholders in the U. S. Bitcoin mining industry in attendance. However, Bailey did not reveal the names of companies or persons that will be present at the roundtable. He emphasized that these industry leaders would make a strong first impression on the former President.This development follows Trump's recent shift in attitude towards cryptocurrency. In May, at the NFT gala Trump expressed his newfound support for crypto stating that his campaign would accept cryptocurrency donations. He also criticized President Joe Biden's understanding of cryptocurrency suggesting that Biden lacks awareness of the industry. Trump's commitment to the crypto space was further solidified as he vowed to halt the current administration's efforts to "crush crypto" and instead foster its growth within the U.S. preventing companies from moving overseas.Bailey's announcement on social media underscored the significance of this engagement noting the industry's enthusiastic response. Bailey also stated that the mining industry has stepped up in a big way and they’re going to make a great first impression.This is a clear attempt to incorporate cryptocurrency into Trump’s policies on the economy by merely participating in the roundtable. Even, he has researched on the concept of using Bitcoin to solve the U.S. national debt problem which is $35 trillion. This proposal shows that Trump has always been keen on using what he deemed as modern methods to solve some of the most persistent economic issues.What CoinGabbar Concluded?The Presidential Roundtable on Bitcoin mining scheduled for the future is a vivid example of the change in political events concerning cryptocurrency. Since Trump has recently signaled his support for cryptocurrencies, this event may very well lead to further comprehensive debate on the potential of digital currencies in the US economy. Given the fact that many of the key players in the industry should be in attendance, the roundtable is set to be a landmark event in the Politics and Cryptocurrency space.Also Read: Will US Election 2024 Unlock Doors For Solana ETF Approval?

Bitcoin Dominance Rises as Binance Coin and Other Alts Turn Red (Market Watch)


																Bitcoin’s dull price actions over the weekend were briefly interrupted with a minor increase toward $70,000 but the asset was stopped in its tracks and has returned to a familiar ground.
Most altcoins are also quite sluggish today, aside from BNB, NEAR, FIL, FET, and a few others, which have recorded notable price drops.
BTC Dominance on the Rise
Bitcoin had a strong last week in terms of ETF inflows, as these financial vehicles kept their impressive streak going, and they have now registered 19 days of consecutive positive flows. The last day when they saw outflows was precisely a month ago, on May 10.
This resulted in some volatility and gains for the underlying asset. It all started last Monday with a surge from $67,500 to over $70,000. After being stopped there at first, BTC returned with a stronger push that drove it to $71,600 on Wednesday and $72,000 on Friday.
That’s where the bears came out of hiding and initiated a massive leg down that resulted in bitcoin dumping by more than three grand in hours. Thus, bitcoin fell to $68,400 and left over $400 million in liquidations across the entire market.


Thanks for subscribing, you will get your first report in the next hours!


The weekend was a lot less eventful, as BTC recovered some ground and stood around $69,000 and $69,500. It tried to jump toward $70,000 earlier today but was stopped and is now back within its range.
Its market cap is still under $1.370 trillion, but its dominance over the alts has increased by nearly 1% since Friday to 51.4% on CG.

BNB on the Retreat
Binance Coin was among the biggest gainers last week as it popped above $700 to register a new all-time high of just over $715. However, it has been on a downfall since then, and the past 24 hours have not been kind. The asset has dropped by 5% within this timeframe to under $650.
NEAR, FIL, FET, and CRO are among the other poorest performers in the past day, while most larger-cap alts are with either insignificant gains or minor losses.
The total crypto market cap has remained at around $2.660 trillion.

Norway Claws Back $5.7M From Biggest Crypto Hack Ever: Here's What Happened - Benzinga

In a significant development, Norwegian law enforcement has managed to recover $5.7 million in cryptocurrency assets that were stolen in the sensational 2022 Ronin Network hack, which remains, to this day, the biggest cryptocurrency hack of all time. What Happened: Sky Mavis, the creator of the platform, announced that the Økokrim (Norwegian National Authority for Investigation and Prosecution of Economic and Environmental Crime) has seized and returned $5.7 million worth of the stolen assets, as reported by The Daily Hodl. With this, law enforcement has frozen a total of $40 million worth of the stolen cryptocurrencies since the exploit.See Also: Analyst Predicts Bitcoin To Reach Groundbreaking $100,000 Milestone“Recovery of these assets requires close coordination and dedicated effort amongst law enforcement agencies, lawyers, accountants, and blockchain forensic teams such as Chainalysis. ~ 15% of recovered assets will be used to cover costs and expenses incurred by those involved in the recovery efforts. The remaining 85% of recovered funds will be deposited into the Axie Infinity treasury,” the company explained.Why It Matters: The Ronin network, an Ethereum ETH/USD sidechain developed by Sky Mavis and primarily used for gaming, fell victim to a major cyberattack in March 2022.The suspected perpetrators, the North Korean cybercriminal group Lazarus Group, exploited the private keys of the Ronin bridge, absconding with 173,600 ETH and 25.5 million USD Coin USDC/USD, worth over $600 million at the time.According to a recent report, Ethereum, the blockchain on which Ronin operates, was the most targeted by hackers in May 2024, accounting for nearly 43% of total losses. In fact, Ethereum and BNB Chain BNB/USD were the most attacked chains, accounting for a staggering 62% of total losses across major chains.Read Next: Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse’s Remarks Revive Dogecoin’s Utility Vs Speculation Debate: ‘Don’t Know What The Use Case Is’Disclaimer: This content was partially produced with the help of Benzinga Neuro and was reviewed and published by Benzinga editors.

They Didn't Give Up on Bitcoin! Institutional Investors Invested in BTC and Three Altcoins: One Was a Surprise! - Bitcoin Sistemi

This week will be a critical week for Bitcoin and altcoins. Because while the FED will announce its June interest rate decision, inflation data will also come from the USA.
While all eyes are on FED and US data in the BTC and cryptocurrency markets, Coinshares published its weekly cryptocurrency report.


Stating that there was an inflow of $2 billion in cryptocurrency investment products last week, Coinshares said that these inflows were in anticipation of an interest rate cut.

“Cryptocurrency investment products have seen a total of $2 billion in inflows, bringing the last 5-week inflow streak to $4.3 billion.”

Bitcoin (BTC) Became the Focus!
When looking at crypto funds individually, it was seen that the majority of fund inflows were in Bitcoin.





While BTC experienced an inflow of $1.97 billion, the largest altcoin Ethereum (ETH) continued to see inflows due to the spot ETF news and experienced an inflow of $68.9 million.
There was an outflow of $5.3 million in the short BTC fund indexed to Bitcoin's decline.


When we look at other altcoins, Fantom (FTM) experienced a small inflow of $1.4 million, XRP $1.2 million, and Solana (SOL) $0.7 million.

“Bitcoin, which saw an inflow of $1.97 billion during the week, was again the main focus, while short Bitcoin saw a total outflow of $5.3 million for the 3rd week in a row.
Ethereum saw its best week since March, experiencing total inflows of $69 million, likely in response to the SEC's surprise decision to allow spot ETFs.
Altcoins saw little movement; Phantom and XRP stood out and saw inflows of $1.4 million and $1.2 million respectively.”

When looking at regional fund inflows and outflows, it was seen that the USA ranked first with an inflow of 1.98 billion dollars.





After the USA, Hong Kong ranked second with 26.1 million dollars, and Canada ranked third with 12.7 million dollars.
Against these inflows, Sweden experienced an outflow of 9.2 million dollars.

Bitcoin Poised For A Big Move After Major Consolidation


																Bitcoin (BTC) seems poised for a major breakout, if prominent analysts are to be believed. The world’s most popular cryptocurrency has been stuck in a consolidation phase for a record-breaking 87 days, but experts say this slumbering giant might be about to awaken with a vengeance.

	Related Reading


Charting A Course For Breakout
Faibik, a well-known crypto analyst, has identified a technical pattern on the Bitcoin daily chart that hints at a potential explosion. This pattern, known as a Descending Broadening Wedge, suggests a price squeeze that often precedes a significant breakout. Faibik believes that a surge past the crucial $71,000 resistance level would be a strong bullish signal, indicating a potential reversal of the recent downtrend.

The DBW on the BTC chart is a sign that the price is getting tighter and tighter, explained Faibik in a recent post. This typically leads to a breakout in one direction or another, and based on the current market sentiment, a bullish breakout seems more likely.

A Quick Bitcoin Price Overview
Source: FXStreet
Using trend lines to connect the three lower highs and three higher lows, the price of bitcoin broke out of the symmetrical triangle pattern on June 4. Nevertheless, the weekly resistance at the $71,280 level refused the breakout.
At the $68,500 mark, which is the upper edge of the symmetrical triangle pattern, BTC is now finding support. Bitcoin might rise 7% to reach its all-time high of $73,777 if current support holds.
Will Bitcoin Emerge A Bullish Butterfly?
Mags, another popular crypto analyst, takes a slightly different approach. He views the current consolidation phase as the longest Bitcoin has ever experienced, surpassing previous periods before significant price increases.
The analyst compares this extended consolidation to a butterfly in its chrysalis, suggesting a potential transformation on the horizon.

Historically, Bitcoin has exhibited a pattern of consolidation around all-time highs, followed by a price discovery phase that precedes sharp price movements, the analyst said. The current 87-day consolidation period shatters previous records, potentially indicating a massive price move could be in the offing.
Mags highlights prior instances where similar consolidation periods preceded major bull runs. In 2017, for example, Bitcoin consolidated for 48 days before a breakout, while in 2020, the consolidation phase lasted 21 days before a significant price increase.

The $71.3k Resistance Level
Both Faibik and Mags agree that a breakout from the current consolidation phase could be a game-changer for Bitcoin. They advise investors to keep a close eye on the $71,300 resistance level, as a surge past this point could signal the start of a bullish trend.

Solana About to Change: Here's Why

In order to improve the fairness and integrity of its network, Solana is taking major action. Recent action by the Solana Foundation to unstake validators discovered to be sharing mempool transactions was somewhat unexpected.This measure is a component of a larger initiative to lower Maximum Extractable Value (MEV) and preserve an ecosystem that can be trusted. SOL/USDT Chart by TradingViewDue to sharing mempool transactions, a number of operators in the Solana Foundation Delegation Program were eliminated. Sharing these may result in MEV-related actions such as sandwich attacks, in which a malicious actor encircles a victim's transaction in order to take advantage of price fluctuations. Enforcement actions are still pending in relation to the Solana Foundation's final decision to remove these validators.What makes this significant?On blockchain networks, MEV is a crucial problem. By rearranging, adding or removing transactions within a block, validators can maximize their profit from blockchain transactions. The Solana Foundation seeks to improve network security and guarantee fair transaction processing by opposing validators who engage in such actions.As a result, Solana becomes a more appealing platform and helps investors and users gain trust. Regarding impact on the market, there is talk that some validators may carry on with MEV procedures in spite of these precautions if they do not have access to specialized tools like Jito.The Solana Foundation and investors, however, provide a sizable portion of the funding for Solana validators. These parties have the power to affect validators' actions, possibly prohibiting them from executing MEV.In the short term, the decision of the foundation may seem too erratic, but at the same time, it is clearly a commitment to making the network safer and more secure. Long-term benefits will make the whole ecosystem more transparent and trustworthy. Of course, some can easily argue that this decision goes against the ethos of decentralization.

Polygon (MATIC) Price Drops to Eight-Month Low


The price of MATIC, the token that powers the leading Layer 2 (L2) platform Polygon, has declined by 10% in the past seven days. This has caused it to trade close to the lower line of the horizontal channel, which it has trended within since April 13. 
If the bearish bias toward altcoins surges, the price risks plummeting below this critical support level and finding new lows. 
MATIC Bears Look to Break Below Support
MATIC exchanged hands at $0.63 at press time, its lowest price since October 2023. Since April 13, its price has oscillated within a horizontal channel, bouncing between resistance at $0.75 and support at $0.64.

Usually, this channel is formed when an asset’s price consolidates within a range for some time. It is caused when there is a relative balance between buying and selling pressures, which prevents the price from trending strongly in either direction.
With MATIC’s price trending toward the lower line of this channel in the past week, it suggests a spike in bearish bias toward the altcoin. This was confirmed by its negative weighted sentiment observed on-chain.
Since the beginning of the month, MATIC’s weighted sentiment has been predominantly negative. At press time, this was -0.64. 
Polygon Weighted Sentiment. Source: Santiment
This metric measures the overall positive or negative sentiment toward an asset by tracking the sentiment and volume of mentions. 
A weighted sentiment value of -0.64 indicates a negative bias in the sentiment surrounding the asset. There are significantly more negative mentions than positive mentions.

This bearish bias was also confirmed by MATIC’s declining futures open interest. At $197 million at press time, it has fallen by 8% since the beginning of June.

Polygon Open Interest. Source: Coinglass
MATIC’s futures open interest tracks the total number of outstanding futures contracts or positions that have not been closed or settled. When it declines, more traders are closing their positions without opening new ones, which is a bearish signal. 
MATIC Price Prediction: The Bulls Have Support to Defend

Readings from MATIC’s key momentum indicators showed an uptick in its sell-off among market participants. For example, its Relative Strength Index (RSI) was 36.44, while its Money Flow Index (MFI) was 26.11. 
Traders use these indicators to measure an asset’s price momentum and identify potential buying and selling opportunities. At these values, MATIC is oversold as buying pressure continues to weaken. 
Polygon Analysis. Source: TradingView

If this trend continues, MATIC will fall below support at $0.64 to exchange hands at $0.61.

However, suppose the bulls successfully defend this support level, and sentiment towards the altcoin shifts to positive. In that case, it might rally to $0.67 and trend toward the upper line of the horizontal channel.

The Friend.Tech app plans to develop its own blockchain

The socialFi app Friend.Tech is preparing to launch its own blockchain powered by its own token FRIEND, definitively abandoning the Ethereum ecosystem and the layer-2 Base.
The news of the new cryptographic network, which will be called Friendchain, has raised quite a few controversies within the platform’s community, prompting users to ask the team for explanations.
Let’s see all the details below.

Friend-Tech and the transition from decentralized app to the Friendchain blockchain
The developers of the decentralized app Friend.Tech are considering leaving the walls of the Ethereum ecosystem and the blockchain of Base to launch a proprietary cryptographic network.
The announcement arrived on Saturday, June 8th, directly from the official X profile of the app, where the project team explained that they will collaborate with the infrastructural provider Conduit to build the first-level blockchain “Friendchain”.
This latter will be powered by the FRIEND token, distributed to its community with an airdrop at the beginning of May, which will serve as a completely transferable gas token.
It has not yet been clarified when the migration from Base to the new blockchain will take place, but it is thought that the transition will likely occur in the first half of 2025.

The users of the platform SocialFi, centered on the tokenization and trading of X profiles, have not hidden their fears and doubts regarding the launch of a proprietary blockchain of questionable necessity. 
In this regard, the trader Dr.Kojipup, commenting on the announcement of June 8, asked the Friend.Tech team how Friendchain will bring value to the decentralized app.

Other individuals have focused on the fact that the new blockchain powered by FRIEND will offer higher commission costs compared to those observable today on the Base network, after the parent company Ethereum completed the Dencun update significantly lowering the gas cost on layer-2.
The only reason that could justify such a choice, which will obviously bring disadvantages on the infrastructural side, is that from the new blockchain several appchains could be launched, whose transactions would be processed in FRIEND.
In any case, the team of Friend.Tech, even if they will not develop other SocialFI apps, will earn from this move by collecting the fees paid by users on Frienchain.
We remember that in the past the co-founder of the project, known as “Racer”, had shown his desire to abandon the layer-2 Base with the goal of developing his own self-sustaining ecosystem.
The impact of this news on the price of the FRIEND token
While the Friend.Tech community asks for explanations regarding the choice to open up to a new blockchain, the FRIEND token responded immediately very well to the news, seeing its price increase in the market.
In particular, in the first 4 hours after the announcement, the crypto recorded an increase of 30%, rising from 1,116 dollars to 1,468 dollars, only to drop in the following hours and stabilize around 1,234 dollars.
The appreciation of the cryptocurrency is due to the fact that with the launch of a new network, FRIEND assumes greater utility having been designated as a gas token.
This has prompted speculators to purchase the currency, sensing that in the future, to use the Friend.Tech network, it will be necessary to have it available in the wallet.
According to the data from Coinmarketcap, in the last 7 days the price action of the token remains negative with an overall devaluation of 67%, partly justified by the launch of the airdrop to the community.
The market capitalization of friend stands at around 10.2 million dollars, with a volume in the last 24 hours of 4.5 million dollars.
Source: https://www.gate.io/. Trading pair FRIEND-USDT, time frame 1h

From here on, if the launch of Friendchain is confirmed, the price evolution of FRIEND will depend greatly on the success of the new blockchain and the fees it will be able to collect.
In support of the holders of this coin, we can report that the Friend.Tech app in its second week after the launch has surpassed the threshold of 1 million dollars in fees, outperforming respectable platforms such as Uniswap and chains like that of Bitcoin.
From October 2023 onwards, the hyper for the SocialFI app gradually decreased, until attention resurfaced in April 2024, just before the inauguration of FRIEND on the markets.

Arbitrum: $215 milioni per il gaming crypto

Official: the DAO of Arbitrum has approved the proposal to allocate 225 million ARB tokens for crypto gaming. 
It is about 215 million dollars to be distributed over three years through the new Gaming Catalyst Program (GCP).


Arbitrum and the proposal for crypto gaming
Arbitrum currently is the largest layer-2 of Ethereum.
Its chain is in fact the fifth in the world for TVL DeFi, behind only those of Ethereum, Tron, BSC, and Solana which are all layer-1. 
On its chain, versions of the main DeFi protocols in the world, such as Uniswap, Aave, Pendle Curve, and many others, are running. 
Furthermore, at this moment its TVL is at an all-time high, as it has surpassed 3.1 billion dollars, just slightly below the 3.2 billion of the historical peak in March. 
In July 2022, in the midst of a bear-market, it was below 600 million dollars, so since then its TVL has more than quintupled. 
The token ARB
The price of the ARB token in the crypto markets, on the other hand, has dropped by 15% in the last seven days, perhaps also due to the news of the allocation of 225 million tokens for the Gaming Catalyst Program. 
Until Thursday the price was above $1, close to $1.1, but on Friday it suddenly dropped to $0.95, and for now it hasn’t bounced back. 
This is a price level in line with that of May 20, therefore Friday’s decline did nothing but wipe out all the gains of the last ten days of the previous month. 
It is worth noting that the peak of 2024 was recorded in January, when it managed to rise above $2.2. Since then, it has been losing 57%.
It should still be remembered that the January peak recorded the new all-time high of the ARB token price, which has existed on the financial markets for just over a year, and therefore did not go through the great bullrun of 2021. 
It should be noted, however, that the initial price in March 2023 was $1.3, which is significantly higher than the current one. 
Crypto news from Arbitrum: The Gaming Catalyst Program
The Gaming Catalyst Program (GCP) is a proposal now approved by the Arbitrum DAO.
The objective of this proposal is to catalyze the growth of the gaming ecosystem on Arbitrum.
Currently Arbitrum is mainly used for low-cost transactions of compatible assets, and for operations in DeFi. 
With GCP, it would like to land as a protagonist also in the crypto gaming online sector. 
The idea is indeed to enhance the games on Arbitrum with 225 million ARB tokens over three years, in order to attract the best studios and the best games in the Web3 sector.
In particular, GCP has been designed to immediately expand the awareness and adoption of Arbitrum/Orbit/Stylus by developers and players. 
It was precisely the significant growth in the DeFi sector in recent times that pushed the Arbitrum community to consider the possibility of venturing into the crypto gaming sector as well, with the goal of attracting the best developers to create high-quality games that should attract and retain new users.
According to the creators of this proposal, currently the games/Web3 segment is still relatively small, but it is expected to grow exponentially in this decade.
The funds
The funds will be used by the GCP to act as a catalyst, with particular attention to onboarding and supporting high-quality developers. 
Therefore, the funds will be distributed mainly to those who will develop crypto games on Arbitrum, for example by co-investing in studios and promising games together with publishers approved and aligned with Arbitrum itself.
Furthermore, publishers and developers will be subject to a series of checks to ensure alignment with the objectives of GCP and with the values of Arbitrum DAO.
160 million ARB tokens will be invested for the onboarding and growth of developers.
25 million will be allocated instead to grants for the creation of games.
135 million will be used for investments. 
Another 40 million, on the other hand, will be distributed in infrastructural prizes.
GCP will have its own dedicated team to manage all operations. 
Note that 225 million ARB tokens are equivalent to almost 8% of the entire current supply of the token, which is approximately 2.9 billion tokens. 
This is therefore a decidedly important initiative, the approval of which has not coincidentally caused the value of ARB to drop by 15%.

All Eyes on the FED in Bitcoin! How Will FED's Interest Rate Decision Affect BTC? Analyst Announces Short-Term Record Target! - Bitcoin Sistemi


This week is of great importance for Bitcoin (BTC) and the cryptocurrency market. Because all eyes are on the interest rate decision of the US Federal Reserve (FED) after the announcement of May's CPI and PPI data.
Although BTC rose above $71,000 last week, it fell sharply after the US Nonfarm Payload data on Friday and fell to $69,000.


Many analysts believe that although the Bank of Canada and the European Central Bank have cut interest rates, the likelihood of the US Federal Reserve moving in a similar direction is low.
According to the CME Group FedWatch Tool, while interest rates are priced to remain constant at 99.4%, investors expect the earliest possible interest rate cut to occur in September.






What is important here is what kind of speech FED Chairman Jerome Powell will make rather than the FED's interest rate decision.


Analysts predict that Bitcoin will rise if Powell gives positive messages about inflation and interest rate cuts.
Expectation of 89 Thousand Dollars for Bitcoin!
Prominent cryptocurrency analyst Ali Martinez predicted a significant potential increase in Bitcoin's value, predicting a rise to the $89,200 level.





Using the rising Bitcoin Buyer Buying Selling Ratio in this prediction, the analyst pointed out that BTC purchases have increased.
The analyst predicts that this significant buying pressure in BTC may cause the Bitcoin price to experience a strong upward movement in the near future and reach as high as $89,200.

Beast trade: Crypto expert takes 12,000% profit on this token


    Although the cryptocurrency market can often be volatile, it can also be a highly lucrative playing field for investors who know how to carefully time their trades right, as one professional crypto trader demonstrated by taking a profit of over 12,000% on one particular meme coin.



Specifically, the pseudonymous crypto market expert CoinsKid revealed that he had taken massive profit on one of his top meme coin picks – Bonk (BONK), which “pumped over 12,000% for us from our 2023 entry point,” according to his X post published on June 10.



Furthermore, the crypto analyst reminded his followers that he had posted twice about the Bonk meme coin in 2023 and announced he was now waiting for another optimal entry point, which he believes could occur “at the green line if we see a breakdown of the rising wedge” chart pattern.

Bonk price analysis



Indeed, at the moment of CoinsKid’s “beast trade,” the Bonk meme coin was changing hands at the price of $0.0000280174, which means it has advanced by a whopping 12,674.82% since the crypto expert’s entry. However, afterward, it has declined by 1.81%, to the price of $0.00002751.

Meanwhile, Bonk’s price represents a loss of 1.56% on the day and a 20.23% drop across the week, which means that the analyst’s new entry position could be just around the corner. On top of that, it is currently sitting above the 100 exponential moving average (EMA), offering a good entry point, as its next target could be $0.00004.



That said, its price dropping below this important indicator could signal capitulation and further declines, so doing one’s own research and carefully weighing the risks is critical when investing a significant amount of money in any asset, be it crypto, stocks, real estate, commodities, or others.

Ethereum news today: Is Solana's anti-MEV move 'overstated'? - AMBCrypto



Solana’s clampdown on MEV validators has attracted divergent opinions. 
Ethereum also faced criticism for its reported strict stance against memecoins. 

The Solana [SOL] vs. Ethereum [ETH] news, which hit many crypto headlines over the last week, seems far from over. 
Over the weekend, the debate between the two leading alternative L1 blockchains resurfaced after Solana clamped down on validators using MEV (Maximal Extractable Value). 
In the fight against MEV, the Solana Foundation reportedly withdrew financial support from validators who engaged in the same. 
But an Ethereum core dev, Ryan Berckmans, downplayed the move and called Solana ‘not a serious settlement layer.’ 
‘Now, the next step in their plan to solve MEV was to pull financial support from validators who extract MEV 😆. Solana is not a serious settlement layer.’ 
For the uninitiated, MEVs are essentially profit strategies maximized by validators by reordering, excluding, or including transactions in the block. 
Is Solana’s anti-MEV good or bad?
Whether the anti-MEV update is great or not is up for debate. 
On his part, Lucas Bruder, CEO of Solana-based MEV infrastructure provider Jito Labs, defended Solana Foundation’s move, stating, 
‘The Solana Foundation is a staker on the network. Stakers should want to see the network be successful. why would they support something that decreases the likelihood of the network being successful?’
The executive added that the move was aimed at protecting the largest Solana user base, meme coin traders. 
‘Most activity on Solana is memecoin trading, so if you screw over the main user base of the blockspace, they’ll leave, and we’ll all be sitting here with less usage wondering why tf we didn’t do anything.’ 
Interestingly, Solana co-founder Anatoly Yakavenko also supported the anti-MEV move as a great way to “respond to user (meme coin traders) needs.”
However, Berckmans claimed that the move was Solana Foundation’s protection of meme coin traders to maintain “competitiveness” against ETH and ETH L2s.
‘I think this story writes itself. The SOL/ETH ratio vastly overstates Solana’s durability as a serious competitor to either the ETH L1 or our best L2s.’
The referenced SOL/ETH ratio tracks SOL’s price chart performance relative to ETH. The ratio has been rising since October 2023 but registered a slight retracement following May’s surprise ETH ETF application. 
This means that SOL has been outperforming ETH on the price charts since last year, but that could change.

More Solana vs. Ethereum news
In a separate development last week, amidst an argument between Iggy Azalea and Vitalik Buterin on celebrity coins, Wintermute CEO Evgeny Gaevoy stated that ETH could fail because of “ETH elites” and not Solana. 
‘If ETH fails in the future it won’t be because “Solana is faster”, it will be because the ETH “elite” is still stuck in a massive contradiction’ 
Notably, Gaevoy’s reaction was based on Buterin and Uniswap’s founder stance that memecoins should be for the greater social good and not for purely financial gains. 
Put differently, Solana has positioned itself as a pro-meme coin trader and launcher, while ETH has taken the opposite approach.

According to data shared with the crypto community by the prominent blockchain tracking service Whale Alert, Binance has seen yet another massive XRP chunk leave its wallet for a blockchain address that belongs to an anonymous whale.The XRP community started actively discussing this transfer in the comments, speculating as to the goal of this transaction and its destination. In the meantime, XRP has so far failed to recover after the enormous plunge it saw on Friday.30.4 million XRP on move from BinanceOver an hour ago, the aforementioned data source spread the word about an astounding XRP transaction made from a Binance wallet to a blockchain address with an unregistered owner. The anonymous whale made a withdrawal of 30,406,274 XRP in total. This amount of crypto is valued at $15,073,991. The community started a heated discussion in the comments, pondering as to the nature of this transaction – the identity of the whale who initiated it and the destination the XRP chunk was sent to.Overall, XRP users remain bullish on the Ripple-affiliated cryptocurrency, and some even expect it to make a bullish breakout this week. One commentator suggested that the anonymous recipient of this transfer could be a bank.This transaction indeed seems like a purchase that could be made by a financial institution or a private cryptocurrency investor.In should be noted that these large XRP transfers from the world’s largest crypto exchange to unknown wallets have been going on for several months now, as Whale Alert has been reporting on them every week, several times a week. Still, data shared by the Bithomp XRP-focused data platform shows that this massive transaction was sent from Binance to a crypto wallet that also belongs to Binance, removing the mystery and turning this transfer into a funds redistribution made by the crypto trading platform between its wallets.XRP price performanceSince Friday, XRP has lost slightly more than 6% of its price. On Friday, XRP faced a 7% price drop, printing three consecutive red candles on an hourly chart, and one of those candles was a tremendous one. On that day, XRP crashed from the $0.526690 level.Since then, XRP has been attempting to recover, but it has so far been trading sideways, moving in the $0.49617 range.

Friend.tech Token Down 22% After Migration Off Base L2 Gets Panned - Decrypt

Subscribe now to Alpha Reports and up your game!Go to Alpha ReportsThe at times wildly popular social app Friend.tech got a mixed reaction to news that it's leaving Base to launch its own network, Friendchain, with infrastructure platform Conduit.Launched in August 2023 on the Base Ethereum L2 network developed by Coinbase, Friend.tech quickly gained traction within the crypto community due to its approach to social interaction and monetization​. But it drew skepticism and ire for exactly the same reasons—that its monetization strategy put the project at risk of drawing ire from regulators.The announcement was followed up with a call for users to secure a spot on the Friendchain testnet, which would qualify participants for a $FRIEND airdrop snapshot. But some members of the community seemed weary at the thought of another chain.One pseudonymous Friend.tech user, The Giver, wrote on Twitter that it's too soon for Friend.tech to be trying to migrate its project and userbase onto a new network.Friend.tech should be trying to capture the maximum number of users before trying to launch its own chain, the user wrote."The ultimate long term vision is for backers/investors to continue clipping protocol fees and to exit at a SaaS multiple to a Web2 company on being the Web3 portal for monetized social media," they said.The decision to leave Base isn't a complete surprise. In May, pseudonymous Friend.tech co-founder Racer hinted at it in a post on Twitter."System design bounty: If you can figure out a way to migrate friendtech off of Base without causing major issues for users, and it works well enough that we decide to use it, we will pay you $200K," the co-founder wrote at the time.But since then the post and the Twitter account have both been deleted.Meanwhile, the FRIEND token saw a brief spike to $1.29 on Sunday, but has otherwise seen its price take a beating over the weekend.At the time of writing, FRIEND is trading for $0.78 after having dropped 20% in the past day.

Ripple CEO Slams Dogecoin 'Not A Good Thing' For Crypto


								At the recent 2024 Consensus Conference, Brad Garlinghouse, the CEO of Ripple, delivered pointed remarks on the state of cryptocurrency, particularly focusing on Dogecoin and its role within the broader industry. Garlinghouse’s assessment was both critical and nuanced, emphasizing that his reservations about Dogecoin stem from concerns over its utility and the speculative dynamics it fostered rather than an outright opposition to the coin itself.
Garlinghouse opened his discussion highlighting the United States’ lag in cryptocurrency regulation, describing it as shockingly inadequate for the world’s largest economy. “The United States represents the bottom decile of regulatory clarity,” he stated, suggesting that this uncertainty hampers the flow of institutional money into cryptocurrencies and clouds the potential growth of the industry.

The Ripple CEO argued that the current environment, characterized by regulatory ambiguity, has inadvertently paved the way for the proliferation of meme-driven cryptocurrencies like Dogecoin. “When you get the real unlock of the United States economy and you get the real institutional money flowing in, it’s just hard to predict some of the upside opportunity,” Garlinghouse explained, indicating that clearer regulations could refocus investment toward more fundamentally sound projects.
Why Dogecoin Is Not “A Good Thing” For Crypto: Ripple CEO
Turning his attention specifically to Dogecoin, Garlinghouse expressed doubt about the cryptocurrency’s value addition to the sector. “You know, I get a ton of s*** when I say these things, but I’m going to say it anyway. I don’t think Dogecoin has been a good thing for the industry. And I’m not anti-Dogecoin, but it’s like, I don’t know what the use case is,” he elaborated.
His critique revolves around the lack of substantive projects or utilities developing around Dogecoin, unlike other blockchain technologies, which are increasingly applied to real-world problems. Dogecoin was the first memecoin, the forerunner of today’s memecoin craze.
Notably, this is not the first instance of the Ripple CEO critiquing Dogecoin. Earlier in the year, at the World Economic Forum in Davos, he highlighted the lack of a clear use case for Dogecoin, attributing its popularity and market movements largely to endorsements by high-profile individuals like Elon Musk, rather than any technological or economic merit. “Other than Elon Musk as the central actor, I don’t see the use case and purpose,” he said.

Garlinghouse’s remarks come at a time when the crypto market is seeing a divergence in performance between traditional altcoins and meme coins. While Bitcoin has already surged above its previous high from 2021, altcoins such as XRP and Cardano are still down -85% from their peaks. Meanwhile, meme coins, including PEPE, Dogwifhat (WIF), and BONK, have captured substantial trader interest, delivering significant gains.
This trend underscores a broader market behavior leaning towards speculation over utility. It’s a dynamic that Garlinghouse criticizes, advocating for a shift towards solving genuine problems. “We have to be about more than speculation […] I see lots of real utility across lots of different, you know, chains. And I think that is what is critical. And for me, the 10 -year prediction has to be about [this], it’s not about speculation, it’s about solving real problems,” he stressed.
At press time, Dogecoin traded at $0.1445.

Toncoin (TON) Price Drops After Logging Year-To-Date High


Toncoin (TON), the cryptocurrency linked to the popular messaging app Telegram, soared to its year-to-date high of $7.54 on June 6. However, it has since shed some of its value, trading at $7.03 at press time.
As the altcoin continues to see its demand fall, its price remains at risk of falling below the $7 price level. 
Toncoin Demand Falls in the Past Week
Toncoin’s (TON) 7% price fall since it rallied to its year-to-date high has been due to the decline in buying momentum in the last week. This was confirmed by the drop observed in the count of TON’s daily active addresses and new address count in the past week.

During that period, the number of active addresses that completed at least one TON transaction dropped by 10%. Likewise, the number of new addresses created daily to trade TON fell by 19% during that period.

When an asset witnesses a decrease in user demand like this, it heightens the risk of a further price decline. This is because it discourages new users from entering the market and existing users from actively trading the crypto asset.
Further, TON’s falling Relative Strength Index (RSI), as observed on-chain, confirmed the surge in selling pressure. At press time, this indicator trended downward and returned a value of 58.

An asset’s RSI measures the momentum of its recent price movements. It typically ranges from 0 to 100, with values above 70 indicating that the asset is overbought and values below 30 suggesting it is oversold.
TON Price Prediction: Price Aims For Support
TON has trended within an ascending channel since May. An ascending channel is a bullish signal formed when an asset’s price makes higher highs and higher lows.
It is characterized by two upward-sloping trend lines: the upper trend line, which represents resistance, and the lower trend line, which forms support.
TON has faced resistance at $8.64 and found support at $6.8. At $7.03 and declining as of this writing, TON appears poised to fall to support and below it. 
Readings from the altcoin’s Moving average convergence/divergence (MACD) indicator hint at this possibility. At press time, TON’s MACD line (blue) is geared to cross below its signal line (orange).

Toncoin Analysis. Source: TradingView
This indicator identifies an asset’s price momentum changes and potential trend reversals. A downward intersection of the MACD line with the signal line is considered a bearish crossover. It is a signal that often precedes an asset’s price downtrend. Traders interpret it as a sign to exit long and open short positions.
If this happens and the bears regain full market control, TON’s price might plummet to $6.41 under support.

However, if invalidated, the altcoin’s value might climb to $7.01 and trend toward resistance.

This Is Why Iggy Azalea’s Meme Coin - MOTHER Soared 30%


Australian rapper Iggy Azalea has revitalized her telecommunications company, Unreal Mobile. This move sparked a 30% increase in her meme coin, Mother Iggy (MOTHER). 
This development comes as many industry leaders have strongly criticized celebrity meme coins.
How Iggy Azalea Tries to Bring Use Case to Her Meme Coin

Azalea announced that Unreal Mobile will accept the meme coin – MOTHER and Solana (SOL) for purchasing phones and monthly cell plans. This update is supported by a partnership with Sphere Labs, a payment infrastructure provider that will help incorporate crypto payments.
Unreal Mobile offers competitive plans ranging from $20 to $80 per month, depending on data usage and network choices. Following Azalea’s announcement on X (formerly Twitter), MOTHER’s value rose by over 30%.

However, Azalea’s new venture coincides with community skepticism. Some community members have mocked her efforts, comparing Unreal Mobile to the well-established Solana Saga Mobile.

“Unreal Mobile is a service provider. Of course, we offer a selection of phones for purchase if needed, but it’s secondary in nature. We love what Anatoly is developing and aim to eventually have it in our available phone options,” Azalea clarified.

Moreover, celebrity meme coins have also received widespread criticism from industry leaders. This is because they often lack substantial backing and are criticized for their superficial nature. Specifically, Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin has been vocal about his concerns.

Nonetheless, Azalea has distanced herself from controversies involving other celebrities and crypto ventures. She strongly denied any association with Sahil Arora, who faces accusations of deceiving investors.
Furthermore, Azalea has pledged to burn portions of her coin holdings in response to any ‘rug pulls’ by celebrities newly entering the crypto space. 
However, the project has faced challenges, including reports from blockchain analytics firm Bubblemaps. They noted significant insider activity at MOTHER’s launch, with insiders acquiring 20% of the supply pre-announcement and later selling tokens worth $2 million. 
These developments have been closely monitored by on-chain investigators, highlighting the complexities of celebrity-driven crypto initiatives.

Surprising NFT Decision from South Korea! Financial Regulatory Authority Changed NFTs Status! - Bitcoin Sistemi

The Financial Services Commission (FSC), South Korea's top financial regulator, has published new guidelines on non-fungible tokens (NFTs), clarifying the application for these tokens.
South Korea Will Treat Some NFTs as Regular Crypto Under New Guidelines
According to Yonhap news agency, the FSC will now regulate certain NFTs as regular cryptocurrencies under certain conditions.


The guidance states that NFTs will be classified as cryptocurrencies if they lose their unique distinguishing characteristics and exhibit characteristics such as mass production, fair fungibility, fragmentation, or use for payments for goods and services.
In contrast, NFTs that are non-transferable and have minimal economic value, such as proof-of-transaction tokens or concert tickets, will continue to be classified as regular NFTs.






An FSC spokesperson stated that the collectibles, of which approximately one million NFTs have been issued, can be traded and used as payment measures similar to cryptocurrencies.
However, the FSC emphasized that the classification of NFTs will be determined on a case-by-case basis and there is no single standard for interpretation.


In addition, the new rulebook suggests that an NFT can be classified as a financial security if it meets the criteria set out in the South Korean Capital Markets Law.
The guidelines come ahead of the implementation of the Virtual Asset User Protection Act, South Korea's first crypto-focused regulatory framework, which will come into full force on July 19.





This law aims to eliminate illegal market activities, including the use of undisclosed information, market price manipulation and fraudulent transactions for crypto investments.

South Korea issues guidelines for classifying NFTs as virtual assets - Crypto Briefing


            
            
                            
            
                            
            
            The Financial Services Commission (FSC), South Korea’s financial watchdog, has issued guidelines detailing when non-fungible tokens (NFTs) should be considered virtual assets. The country is preparing to implement the ‘Virtual Asset User Protection Act’ by July 19 this year.Under the new guidelines, NFTs that are mass-produced, divisible, and can be used as a means of payment will be regulated similarly to cryptocurrencies. The FSC believes that NFT collections with high quantities have a higher probability of being used as payment, especially if there are a large number of transactions.Jeon Yo-seop, head of the FSC’s Financial Innovation Planning Division, stated in an interview that if an NFT collection consists of 1 million NFTs, it is likely that they could be used as a payment method. However, the FSC noted that it will distinguish collections through a case-by-case review, meaning there will be no absolute standard in interpreting NFTs as crypto.NFTs that possess little to no value, such as those used in ticketing or digital certificates, will be treated differently and classified as general NFTs. The guidelines also suggest that NFTs could be treated as securities if they showcase features specified in South Korea’s Capital Markets Act.The FSC previously mentioned that virtual assets must receive interest when deposited into a crypto exchange as part of the new rules for virtual assets set to take effect in July 2024. While regular NFTs and central bank digital currencies (CBDCs) are excluded from this requirement, the new update from the FSC reiterates that NFTs classified as virtual assets can receive interest once they are deposited on exchanges.Businesses handling NFTs must review the guidelines to determine if their NFTs qualify as virtual assets. If so, they must comply with the ‘Specific Financial Information Act,’ which covers the sale, exchange, transfer, storage, and brokerage of virtual assets. Failure to report as a virtual asset business operator could result in criminal penalties.The FSC offers consultation services for businesses uncertain about their NFTs’ classification and will provide examples and case judgments to assist businesses in navigating these new regulations.

Kraken plans $100 million funding round before stock market launch (IPO) - Crypto Valley Journal

The crypto exchange Kraken was one of the first trading platforms for bitcoin in 2011. After Coinbase, the exchange handles the second highest volume in the US market. Like its competitor, Kraken is now planning an initial public offering (IPO), preceded by a funding round.Kraken has received inquiries from potential investors amid the ongoing crypto rally, according to an insider who spoke to Bloomberg. The company is now considering a final funding round that could raise more than $100 million. After securing this target, Kraken would pursue an IPO. Considering Robinhood's $200 million acquisition of European crypto exchange Bitstamp, the plan could be a successful one.
Pre-IPO funding of $100 millionThe funds would be raised in a "pre-IPO round" - a private funding round before the actual IPO. This fundraising could be completed by the end of the year, according to one of the insiders. For the actual IPO, Kraken is looking for a significant partner company to join the board and help structure the IPO. However, nothing concrete has been put on paper yet.Kraken has been considering an IPO since 2021. In April of that year, Coinbase became the first crypto exchange to go public, with a valuation of $100 billion. Kraken's IPO plans have been delayed due to the subsequent downturn in the crypto market and multiple legal battles with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Competitor Coinbase is facing similar litigations for allegedly offering unlicensed securities related to cryptocurrencies.Another multi-billion dollar IPO?If Kraken's IPO is successful, the exchange could become one of the most highly valued crypto companies. Currently, the trading platform is privately held and does not release revenue figures. In addition, Kraken has only raised $129 million in venture capital since 2011 - five times less than its publicly traded U.S. competitor. However, according to insiders Kraken is expected to generate between $1 billion and $2 billion in revenue this year.Analysts estimate that Coinbase will generate around $6 billion in revenue by 2024. The market currently values the largest US exchange at nearly $60 billion. Using a similar revenue multiple of around ten, which is not uncommon in the tech sector, Kraken could go public at a valuation of up to $20 billion. The exchange has not yet publicly confirmed these plans.

Economist Henrik Zeberg Says Altcoins Set To Go ‘Flying’ in Blow-Off Top Style Euphoric Bull Run - The Daily Hodl


								Economist Henrik Zeberg says that the altcoin market is setting up for a parabolic run to new highs before the global economy witnesses a recession.
Zeberg tells his 143,000 followers on the social media platform X that he’s looking at the TOTAL-ETH-BTC chart, which measures the entire market cap of crypto assets besides Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH).










Zeberg sees TOTAL-ETH-BTC skyrocketing into “euphoria” near the $1.83 trillion level.
“BLOW-OFF TOP far from done yet!
US Equities and Crypto will soar into the final – and most speculative phase – of this Business Cycle. Altseason will send Alts flying.
Euphoria will develop!”
Source: Henrik Zeberg/X
At time of writing TOTAL-ETH-BTC is valued at $662.75 billion.
Zeberg shares another chart suggesting that central banks like the Federal Reserve in the US and the European Central Bank (ECB) tend to cut rates shortly before a recession.
“Economic Expansion ahead – or Late Cycle and hence Recession ahead?
Let me make it easy for people who find it difficult to understand where we are in the Business Cycle.
On Thursday, ECB chose to cut its Fund Rates.
ECB and FED always will try to cut rates late cycle to hinder economy from falling into recession.
Now look at the chart.
Are we ‘Late Cycle’ – or standing in front of ‘New Economic Expansion’?
THINK!”
Source: Henrik Zeberg/X
This month, both the Bank of Canada (BOC) and the ECB lowered interest rates.
The Federal Reserve’s next statement on the Federal Funds Rate is expected at the June 12th Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting. The central bank is expected to keep rates unchanged.

Robert Kiyosaki sounds alarm on 'fake money' and long-term inflation


    Amid his repeated warnings about a potentially devastating economic crisis, popular investor and finance author Robert Kiyosaki has sounded alarm on, as he called it, “fake money” controlled by “Marxists” in the American government, as well as the lengthy inflation at the country’s doorstep.



Indeed, Kiyosaki voiced his opinion that the current United States President, Joe Biden, had “caused inflation to rise, making life harder for the poor and middle class” after cutting the Keystone XL pipeline, which “caused the price of oil to rise from $30 to $130 in just one week,” per his X post on June 9.



Inflation taking hold



Furthermore, the author of the best-selling personal finance book ‘Rich Dad Poor Dad’ warned that “inflation will be with us for years” despite his belief that Biden will not win the presidential elections, as he argued that the “liberal academic ‘swamp’ that brought the Biden crime family to power… are still in power.”







For this reason, as well as his conviction that the ruling establishment in the US, or as he called them, “Marxists,” control “politics and fake money,” referring to the US dollar, but that they “cannot control real money,” or gold, silver, and Bitcoin (BTC), which he is accumulating as a safeguard against them.







Robert Kiyosaki’s favorite assets



As a reminder, Kiyosaki has long shared his preference for precious metals and the flagship decentralized finance (DeFi) asset and the world’s first cryptocurrency, praising them as ideal investments to protect oneself against what he sees as the US government’s incompetence.



In particular, he has recently opined that Bitcoin could hit the price of $350,000 by the end of August 2024, as well as predicting that other popular crypto assets, including Ethereum (ETH) and Solana (SOL), could witness a continuous increase in prices.



Meanwhile, Kiyosaki’s favorite asset in the crypto market was at press time changing hands at the price of $69,255, up 0.03% in the last 24 hours, advancing 0.76% across the previous seven days, as well as adding up to the accumulated gain of 14.16% on its monthly chart, as per data on June 10.

Subscribe now to Alpha Reports and up your game!Go to Alpha ReportsNotcoin, a Play-to-Earn game on Telegram, has announced that its total player base now stands at 40 million. In doing so, the team has debunked claims of third-party tools that miscalculate the number of players because they use the wrong parameters.Currently, Notcoin is trading at $0.0185, an increase of 5% in the past 24 hours, and an eye-watering gain of 210% in the past 14 days, according to CoinGecko.Earlier this month, the NOT token hit an all-time high of $0.0283, which saw its market capitalization soar past the $2.75 billion mark.Players have earned $1.5 million in TON across 20 campaigns. The team expects the figures to increase drastically once automated campaigns go live on the platform.Notably, the team has announced new features that they are working on as part of their roadmap. This includes rewards sharing with friends, gold and platinum players gaining access to highly sought-after token launches, implementing automated campaigns, and new players gaining access to levels.On May 20, the total player base stood at 35 million.

According to the most recent CoinShares report, XRP, the seventh-largest cryptocurrency by market cap, attracted inflows of $1.2 million in the past week. This surge stands in contrast to the subdued activity observed across the broader altcoin market.Per the recently released CoinShares report, digital asset investment received $2 billion in inflows, increasing the total for the last five weeks to $4.3 billion.Bitcoin was once again the dominant focus, with $1.97 billion inflows, while altcoins, except Ethereum, experienced just a little activity. Ethereum saw its greatest week of inflows since March, totaling $69 million, drawing from spot-based ETFs optimism.According to the CoinShares report, XRP, alongside Fantom, stood out, with inflows of $1.2 million and $1.4 million, respectively.While XRP basks in the spotlight, other altcoins have seen only minor inflows. Solana, Litecoin and Chainlink experienced inflows of $0.7 million, while Binance received only $0.2 million.XRP is showing a weekly pattern of increasing inflows; in the week before last, XRP received $0.8 million, up from $0.4 million the week earlier.The reasons for the XRP inflow rise could be a variety of factors, including a shift in investor interest, although the actual explanation is unknown.XRP price actionAt the time of writing, XRP was up 0.37% in the last 24 hours to $0.496. XRP has been trading in a tight range since Friday's sharp plunge to lows of $0.454.XRP has returned to trade below its daily SMA 50 at $0.522, increasing the likelihood of consolidation or range trading in the short term.The first sign of strength would be a break over the daily SMA 50 ($0.522). In this situation, if the XRP price breaks and closes above $0.54, it could indicate that bulls are attempting to make a comeback. XRP could reach the overhead barrier of $0.57.On the contrary, if the price falls below the current range support line at $0.48, XRP may retest the $0.46 level.

Cardano Hype Train Departs - Hoskinson Predicts June Hard Fork To Boost ADA


								Cardano, the blockchain network championed by Charles Hoskinson, is on the cusp of a major upgrade. The upcoming Chang hard fork, targeted for June, promises to usher in a new era dubbed the “Age of Voltaire.” While excitement simmers within the Cardano community, a crucial question lingers: will this translate to a price surge for ADA, the network’s native token?

Hoskinson’s Vision Realized
Cardano’s development has been a marathon, not a sprint, meticulously guided by Charles Hoskinson’s vision. Unlike some blockchain projects that prioritize rapid innovation, Cardano emphasizes rigorous testing and peer-reviewed research.
One of the key features of the Chang hard fork is the implementation of Voltaire, a novel governance system championed by Hoskinson himself. He boasts that Voltaire will be “the most advanced blockchain governance system” in existence.


It empowers ADA holders to participate in shaping the network’s future through a system of proposals and voting. This enhanced decentralization addresses a major criticism Cardano has faced – concerns about perceived centralization under Hoskinson’s leadership.
Will Cardano Investors See The Light?
While the technical advancements and increased decentralization championed by Hoskinson are exciting developments, the impact on ADA’s price remains a cause for debate. The token has had a rough year, currently trading at around $0.44, a significant drop from its all-time high of over $3.
Proponents believe the Chang fork could be a catalyst for a price increase. Increased investor interest in a more robust governance structure could drive demand for ADA. Additionally, a decoupling from Bitcoin’s price movements is a possibility.

However, skepticism remains. The cryptocurrency market is notoriously fickle, and major price swings are often based on a combination of factors beyond technical upgrades. Some analysts warn that the impact of the hard fork on price might be overstated.
Innovation Vs. Market Volatility
The Chang hard fork is a pivotal moment for Cardano. It represents a significant leap forward in terms of functionality and decentralization. However, the project faces the challenge of balancing its commitment to thorough development with the fast-paced and often impatient nature of the cryptocurrency market.

In the meantime, Cardano’s meticulous approach, while commendable, may need to adapt to the ever-evolving demands of the cryptocurrency landscape.

MN Trading's Poppe: Polkadot (DOT) Undervalued, Poised for RWA Boom


							

Polkadot is stepping into the Real World Assets (RWA) segment as a market leader.



Michael van de Poppe thinks DOT is heavily undervalued.



The renowned analyst highlighted the potential developments for SUI, LINK, FLOKI, and FTM.




MN Trading founder Michael van de Poppe positions Polkadot (DOT) as a frontrunner in the emerging Real World Assets (RWA) space. Poppe points to recent developments within the Polkadot ecosystem, including the release of the JAM whitepaper, which he views as a pivotal innovation for Polkadot 2.0.







Based on these developments, Poppe believes DOT, the native token of the Polkadot ecosystem, is significantly undervalued. He emphasizes Polkadot’s SDK toolkit as one of the most widely used tools within the crypto space, streamlining the development process for blockchain products.



Poppe identifies RWAs as the key to widespread adoption of blockchain technology, as it bridges the gap between the real and digital worlds. He estimates the RWA market to be massive, potentially reaching a total market cap of $10 trillion by 2030. This growth, according to Poppe, is likely to positively impact DOT’s price in the near future.



In addition to DOT, the renowned analyst highlights critical developments in other altcoins that traders should be aware of. He observes that SUI has established a higher low and may be poised for a breakout. Poppe predicts the new altcoin could surge to $1.60 if it breaks above $1.17 with strong momentum.









Poppe believes LINK is also undervalued, with its price currently at the bottom of a sideways trading channel. The analyst notes LINK’s historical trend of initiating price rotations in June, suggesting the potential for a 150% return in the near future.



While Poppe anticipates rallies for DOT, SUI, and LINK, he has a different outlook for FLOKI. He acknowledges the memecoin’s impressive 1,200% surge since the market rally began, but also points to a potential liquidity sweep above the previous high. Poppe expects an imminent correction for FLOKI, potentially leading to a 40% pullback before resuming its upward trajectory.



Poppe predicts a potential downturn for FTM’s price due to the formation of lower highs and lows. He anticipates a price breakdown due to multiple retests of the $0.60 support level. Poppe identifies the $0.60 support zone and the lower $0.40 area as key levels to watch before a potential FTM recovery.

US Dollar strong again after the latest labor market data

The US dollar has returned to being strong, after the release of last week’s US labor market data. 
In fact, from May 30 to Friday, June 7, the Dollar Index had dropped from 105.1 points to 104.1, but then not only returned above 105 points, but also rose today above 105.2.
The current level has not been seen since mid-May, that is, for almost a month during which it has often fluctuated just above 104.5 points. 
Indeed, until Friday it seemed that a slight medium-term downward trend was in place, which however was interrupted on Friday. 

The Dollar Index
The Dollar Index, also known as USDX or DXY, is simply a measure of the value of the US dollar not against another single currency, but against a basket of foreign currencies. 
This basket is composed of six foreign currencies, euro, Japanese yen, British pound, Canadian dollar, Swedish krona, and Swiss franc, but does not include the Chinese yuan. 
Of these six currencies, the euro has the greatest weight within the index, with as much as 57.6%, followed by yen (13.6%), pound (11.9%), and Canadian dollar (9.1%). 
Generally, when its value rises, it means that speculators in the financial markets sell assets to buy dollars, although the variation in the exchange rate with the euro also obviously has a significant impact.
In fact, shortly after Friday’s jump, the price of Bitcoin for example started to fall, then dropping in a few minutes from about $72,000 to about $69,000.
Since the beginning of the year, the Dollar Index has risen significantly, given that it had closed 2023 at 101.4 points. 
This rise, however, occurred in two specific periods: in January and early February, reaching 104.9 points, and then in the first half of April, when it also rose above 106.4 points. 
Since then, it seemed that a downward trend had been triggered, which in fact had brought it back to 104 points last week, and which instead might have been interrupted on Friday. 
The current value is still relatively high compared to the 2024 series, although not yet close to the annual highs. 
It should not be forgotten, however, that during the bear-market of 2022 it had even reached 114 points, a value that had not been seen for twenty years. 
A proxy of fear
Given that the Dollar Index often rises when other assets are sold on financial markets, it can be used as a proxy for short-term fear. 
In fact, in case of fears for the long term, gold is generally purchased, but if it is sold only with the intention of buying back later at lower prices, then it is much better to purchase US dollars. 
Taking into consideration the last 5 years, before the outbreak of the pandemic the Dollar Index was at 99 points, significantly lower compared to current levels. At the time of the financial markets crash in March 2020, it shot up to 103.2 points in just a few days, but with the Fed’s QE it started to decline sharply, reaching 89.8 points in December of the same year. 
During the second half of 2021, it started to rise again to return to pre-pandemic levels, and then from March 2022 to reach new decade highs in October. 
This rise was a clear sign of both the short-term fear circulating in the financial markets at that time and the bear-market in progress. 
What is surprising, however, is that it has never returned to pre-pandemic levels, although in July of last year it came close. 
US Job Market: The Reason for the Dollar’s Rise
The rise on Friday, which could also mark a trend reversal compared to the decline of the past few weeks, was triggered by positive news on the US job market. 
The reason is simple: the better the US economy performs, the higher the risks of inflation, making it more difficult for the Fed to cut rates. 
Financial markets depend heavily on the liquidity injected or withdrawn from circulation, so a restrictive monetary policy by the main central bank of the world ends up having bearish effects. 
At the moment when the markets understood that, due to the good pace at which the US economy is proceeding, the prospects for the first Fed rate cut are moving away, they reacted badly, and the rise of the Dollar Index only shows a clear increase in fear in the medium-short term. 
It should not be forgotten that the indices of the USA stock exchanges are still close to their highs, with the S&P500 having set the record just on Friday. 
In such a scenario, it is expected that the Fed will start cutting rates, or that liquidity in the financial markets will increase again, but such confidence can be questioned by the Fed, which might instead opt for a continuation of its current restrictive monetary policy.

$5 Million Drained in Loopring Guardian Wallet Attack


On Sunday, Loopring, the Ethereum-based ZK-rollup protocol, experienced a major security breach. This incident resulted in losses reaching millions of dollars.
The attack targeted the Guardian wallet recovery service, exploiting a vulnerability in the two-factor authentication (2FA) process.
Loopring Collaborates with Experts and Authorities After the Hack

Loopring’s Guardian service lets users designate trusted wallets for security tasks, such as locking a compromised wallet or restoring one if the seed phrase is lost. The hacker bypassed this service, initiating unauthorized wallet recoveries with a single guardian.
By compromising Loopring’s 2FA service, the hacker impersonated the wallet owner. This allowed the hacker to gain approval for the recovery process, reset ownership, and withdraw assets from the affected wallets. The exploit mainly affected wallets that lacked multiple or third-party guardians.

The team identified two wallet addresses involved in the breach. On-chain data indicates one wallet drained approximately $5 million from the compromised wallets, which have now completely swapped to Ethereum (ETH).
Loopring explained that they are collaborating with Mist security experts to determine how the hacker compromised their 2FA service. They have also temporarily suspended Guardian-related and 2FA-related operations to protect users, which stopped the compromise.

“Loopring is working with law enforcement and professional security teams to track down the perpetrator. We will continue to provide updates as soon as the investigation progresses,” it added.


The incident occurred after crypto market data aggregator CoinGecko was victim to a data breach via its third-party email service provider, GetResponse. On June 5, the hacker compromised the account of a GetResponse employee and exported nearly 2 million contacts from CoinGecko’s account.
This attacker then dispatched 23,723 phishing emails using the account of a different GetResponse client. The malicious actors didn’t use CoinGecko’s domain to send harmful emails.
CoinGecko further assured its users that the hacker did not compromise their accounts and passwords despite the breach. However, the leaked data did include users’ names, email addresses, IP addresses, and the locations where emails were opened.

CoinGecko has advised users to be vigilant in response to the breach, especially when receiving emails purporting to offer airdrops. The platform also urged users to avoid clicking links or downloading attachments from unexpected emails and adhere to recommended security measures.

Bitcoin devs calm panic over Core bug false alarm


Erroneous rumors of a possible bug in Bitcoin Core caused widespread panic this weekend as the Bitcoin community jumped to a number of massively off-beam conclusions.
The claims appeared in the weekly Optech newsletter produced by non-profits Brink and Bitcoin Operations Technology Group.
Most weeks, the letter focuses on largely mundane topics like repository changes, pull request details, or mailing list messages. However, on Friday, it included a vague reference to an “upcoming disclosure of vulnerabilities affecting older versions of Bitcoin Core.”
This caused paranoid Bitcoiners to jump to disastrous interpretations and posts to X (formerly Twitter) warning of “a serious vulnerability with Bitcoin Core v24” earned tens of thousands of impressions.

Read more: Don’t download your full node Bitcoin software from Bitcoin.org
“It is strongly recommended that all users and administrators upgrade to Bitcoin Core 25.0 or above,” X users warned. If there is a bug, they thought, it could have affected thousands of fully validating nodes running the decentralized Bitcoin network. 
For context, Bitcoin Core is by far the dominant software that Bitcoin node operators use. Over 56,000 node operators run it around the world, with over 18,000 online at any given moment.
Not only that, more than 98% of reachable nodes use Bitcoin Core as their software client. The current version is 27, released on April 16. Developers released version 24 last year and deprecated it months ago.
However, unlike conventional software like app store or manufacturer software updates, Bitcoin Core does not auto-update. Yes, that means that node operators must download and upgrade their software manually.
Because some node operators choose not to (or forget to) update their software, old versions of Bitcoin Core validate transactions on the Bitcoin network for months or even years. This can be problematic if hackers discover a bug and exploit nodes running old software.
Senior Bitcoin developer responds to fire alarm
Bitcoin Core developer Ava Chow stepped into the public discourse to turn off this false alarm. She clarified categorically, “Not 24.x. First set of disclosures would be for 0.21.x and older.”
In other words, the imminent vulnerability disclosure discussed in the Optech newsletter relates to Bitcoin Core version 21, not 24.
The confusion arose from two factors. First, Optech correctly summarized a proposal by developers to disclose vulnerabilities in old versions of Bitcoin Core. That proposal might, if and when fully enacted, allow developers to disclose technical vulnerabilities in versions of software up to 12 months old and older.
Therefore, if this proposal were enacted (and it isn’t yet), it would allow developers to disclose any severe bugs in last year’s version.
However, again, the proposal is still in discussion. Developers haven’t yet agreed what length of time is appropriate for the disclosure of major bugs. 
The leading proposal attempts to find a compromise between never disclosing and immediately disclosing. “The proposed policy tries to strike a balance between these two,” wrote Chow. “Waiting for the last vulnerable version to go EOL [end of life] seems like a good middle ground — enough time for the vast majority of nodes to upgrade, but not so long that issues never get disclosed.”
So, as a starting point, developers are going to disclose security bugs in version 21 later this month. Again, that’s version 21, not 24.

Swift response to a fake bug in Bitcoin Core
As a culturally conservative community, it’s certainly in Bitcoiners’ self-interest to take security threats very seriously. By far the largest and most distributed crypto asset, the Bitcoin node and mining network secures over $1.3 trillion worth of coins held by hundreds of millions of humans.
Although this particular vulnerability regarding Core version 24 was probably a false alarm, the serious response was healthy.
There’s a vanishingly tiny number of nodes operating version 21 or older of Bitcoin Core, so it’s probably appropriate to responsibly disclose the bug that existed in that software. Moreover, it’s usually a good safety protocol to update to the latest version of Core, anyway.
The modern version of Bitcoin Core is 27 so it’s probably fine to disclose the errors that developers made when coding version 21.
Developers haven’t planned to disclose security bugs in version 24 this month. They are, however, discussing a policy to shorten the length of time between private detection of bugs by Bitcoin Core maintainers and public disclosure of those bugs.
In the future, a true fire — and not just a fire drill — might broadcast an all-hands-on-deck call for node operators or miners to respond to a legitimate security vulnerability. For now, however, this was merely a test.

This is What You Need to Know About Ripple (XRP) This Week


																TL;DR

XRP dropped to $0.48 and recovered to nearly $0.50. Analysts predict potential rallies to $1.50 and $6.50-$7.50.
Some foresee short-term declines due to upcoming US CPI data, but expect long-term gains. The RSI metric suggests a possible rebound.


XRP’s Next Possible Move
Ripple’s XRP has been quite shaky in the past several weeks, with its price dipping by 6% on a 14-day scale. The asset was significantly affected by the latest market correction, dropping to as low as $0.48 on June 7. It reclaimed some lost ground in the following days and is currently trading at almost $0.50 (per CoinGecko’s data).
However, the negative trend has not stopped bullish analysts from speculating that XRP is on the verge of a substantial price rally. The X user EGRAG CRYPTO believes the asset will break a specific pattern depicted as “the White Triangle” and rise to $1.50. 
Later on, XRP could jump to $6.50-$7.50 should it surpass the Fib 1.618 zone. According to the trader, this is when many investors will start taking profits. 
Matthew Dixon chipped in, too, arguing that XRP “is still coiling in the form of a correction and may be driven lower short term before a powerful spring higher is anticipated.”




He thinks a possible elevated US CPI data later this week could trigger a price decline for the token. However, holders “will likely be rewarded when interest rates” eventually start decreasing, Dixon added.
The US Bureau of Labor Statistics is set to release the latest Consumer Price Index on June 12. The Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting, which decides whether interest rates in the United States should be raised, lowered, or kept at the same level (currently 5.25% to 5.50%) is scheduled for the same day. Both events have historically been followed by enhanced volatility in the cryptocurrency market.
It is worth mentioning that not all analysts envision a bright future for XRP. Not long ago, the X user Jason A. Williams predicted that the asset’s value could plummet to $0.27 during the next bull cycle. In contrast, they expect a new all-time high of $336,000 for Bitcoin (BTC) and a fresh peak of $12,000 for Ethereum (ETH).
Observing an Important Indicator
One major on-chain metric suggesting that XRP is facing better days ahead is the Relative Strength Index (RSI). The technical analysis tool measures the speed and change of price movements and identifies whether the asset is oversold or overbought. 
It ranges from 0 to 100, and a ratio above 70 indicates that XRP could be headed for an imminent pullback. The RSI dropped to a multi-low of 22 a few days ago, while currently it stands at 38.

MicroStrategy CEO Michael Saylor Announces the Amount of Bitcoin ETFs Companies Hold! Here are the Details - Bitcoin Sistemi

Michael Saylor, Chairman of MicroStrategy and a leading Bitcoin advocate, announced a major milestone for Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs).
Michael Saylor Announces Bitcoin ETFs Holding More than 1 Million BTC
According to Saylor, 34 spot Bitcoin ETFs collectively hold over one million BTC, specifically 1,031,973 BTC.


This success underscores the growing appeal of Bitcoin ETFs, which allow investors to gain access to Bitcoin without directly holding the cryptocurrency.
The fact that these ETFs have accumulated more than one million BTC marks a significant milestone in the cryptocurrency market and demonstrates strong institutional and retail investor interest.





Successful Bitcoin ETFs include those managed by financial giants BlackRock and Fidelity Investments.
These funds shift the center of gravity in the cryptocurrency market from Asia to the United States, reflecting Wall Street's increasing adoption of digital assets.


BlackRock's iShares Bitcoin Trust has become the world's largest Bitcoin fund, with assets exceeding $21.4 billion, surpassing Grayscale's $20.1 billion Bitcoin Trust.

Fidelity's Wise Origin Bitcoin Fund ranks third with assets of $12.3 billion.





Michael Saylor's own company, MicroStrategy, is notable for its aggressive Bitcoin accumulation strategy, having 214,400 BTC as of May 1, 2024.
In recent weeks, US Bitcoin ETFs have seen a surge in demand, recording net inflows for 19 consecutive days. On June 7 alone, 11 Bitcoin ETFs attracted $131 million in inflows, adding to the momentum pushing Bitcoin to new highs.
This milestone for Bitcoin ETFs highlights the growing mainstream acceptance and adoption of Bitcoin as an investment asset and signals a solid future for cryptocurrency markets.

Bitcoin (BTC) Price Little Changed After Liquidation Rout

Bitcoin was little changed over the weekend following a $400 million liquidation rout on Friday. BTC fell to under $69,000 from over $71,000 after U.S. non-farm payrolls data came in stronger than expected, which saw open interest and trading volume slump. Since Friday, the number of unsettled futures contracts across various tokens slid to $60 billion from $99 billion, suggesting traders significantly pared bets. However, analysts at Presto Research told CoinDesk that they expect market volatility to return in the week ahead with macroeconomic catalysts such as the CPI release on Wednesday. BTC traded around $69,450 during early European hours. The CoinDesk 20 Index (CD20) has fallen around 0.5% in the past 24 hours.

Uniswap Founder Advocates For The End Of Ethereum (ETH) Gas Fees | Bitcoinist.com


								The debate over Ethereum (ETH) gas fees has been a significant topic within the crypto space for quite some time now. Joining the fray is Uniswap protocol founder and Chief Executive Officer (CEO) Hayden Adams, who has suggested a future where Ethereum users no longer need to worry about gas fees.
Hayden Adams Declares Demise Of Ethereum Gas Fees
During the weekend, Hayden Adams, the inventor of Uniswap, one of the largest Decentralized Exchanges (DEX), took to the X (formerly Twitter) platform to share his thoughts on Ethereum’s gas fees. According to the founder, the term gas fee should never have to be heard by any user, emphasizing that these costs should not be a barrier to accessing decentralized finance (DeFi) and other blockchain-based services.

Adams’ statement coincides with ongoing discussions within the Ethereum community regarding the reduction of high costs associated with on-chain transactions, which have been an obstacle to the broader adoption of the network.
Gas fees are transaction costs that must be paid in ETH in order to complete transactions on the Ethereum network. They are necessary to pay miners who keep the Ethereum blockchain functioning. These costs are contingent on network demand and may rise when there is congestion.
Reduced or no gas fees allow consumers to join the Ethereum ecosystem who previously could not afford to conduct transactions due to high costs, developing great opportunities to manage their on-chain operations better. As a result of this greater participation, the demand for ETH may rise significantly.
The founder statement heralds a revolutionary change in the accessibility and user experience of blockchain technology, with the goal of enhancing the inclusivity and efficiency of decentralized finance and other applications.​ Also, Adams hopes to make Ethereum more accessible and inclusive in the future by eliminating the financial constraint of gas costs, which could greatly increase user adoption and involvement in the DeFi area. 
This prospective modification may also make Uniswap more competitive, which might draw in more consumers looking for affordable DeFi trading options. Should Uniswap be able to remove the gas fee from its platform, it may eventually spark a new wave of acceptance. However, this would not be easy.
Efforts In Addressing ETH Gas Fees
It is important to note that Ethereum’s team has been demonstrating its efforts in addressing the network’s gas fees by introducing several notable upgrades over time. These include the Dencun upgrade, the EIP-7706 proposal, and the ongoing Pectra upgrade.

In March, Ethereum’s team introduced the Dencun upgrade, which efficiently reduced ETH gas fees to its lowest point since 2020. Specifically, the update decreased ETH’s need for data storage, which in turn reduced its gas prices.
So far, the upgrade has improved the network’s capabilities. Before now, ETH’s network was limited to 13 to 60 Transactions Per Second (TPS). Following the integration of Dencun, the network can now process between 30,000 and 100,000 TPS.

Aptos crypto gains momentum, hits $8.41 - What's fueling the surge? - AMBCrypto



On-chain data showed that the sentiment around the crypto was bearish.
Development activity improved and other indicators predicted a rise in Aptos price.

Days after it confirmed a collaboration with a certain project, Aptos [APT] is showing signs of life again. At press time, the Aptos crypto price had increased by 2.10% in the last 24 hours.
This move ensures that the value of the token was $8.41. Like the price, the trading volume jumped, indicating a rising interest in Aptos.
However, the increase was not without cause and could be traced back to a disclosure on the 6th of June. On the aforementioned date, IONET, a decentralized AI computing platform revealed that it had partnered with Aptos.
Not everyone is excited
According to the project, the decision was because it found Aptos  as the perfect layer-1 blockchain to provide a transparent record of AI assets. As a result, IONET has deployed its generative AI product on the Aptos crypto blockchain.
Furthermore, IONET’s founder and CEO Ahmad Shadid mentioned that Aptos’ high speed and scalability was one of the reasons it chose the blockchain.
Currently, Aptos can process 25,000 transactions per second, making it one of the  few blockchains with such capability.
Despite the development, the Weighted Sentiment around Aptos dropped. At press time, AMBCrypto’s analysis of Santiment showed that the metric was -0.493, indicating that most comments about APT were negative.
Should this remain the case, demand for the token might fall. Also, the recent price increase could be neutralized. However, social dominance around the Aptos crypto jumped.
This indicated that discussion around it compared to other assets in the top 100 had improved. But the improvement is no proof of a potential rally, and our finding showed that it could be linked to IONET again.
Source: Santiment
TVL rises but that is not all
Apart from its partnership with Aptos, IONET’s cryptocurrency would be launched on the 11th of June. With a Binance listing approaching, it seemed that market participants were including Aptos crypto in the rising conversations due to their connection.
Another metric AMBCrypto examined was the Total Value Locked (TVL). On the 14th of May, Aptos TVL dropped to $326.99 million, according to data from DeFiLlama.
However, press time data showed that the metric had recovered, and was at $379.91 million. The increase could be attributed to the high level of assets locked or staked in protocols under the chain.
If sustained, the value of assets locked in Aptos could rise as high as $450 million as it was in April. But if the perceived trust falls, the metric could slide again.
Source: DeFiLlama
Meanwhile, development activity on the Aptos blockchain has been increasing. As of this writing, on-chain data showed that the reading was 50.90.
This metric is crucial for any project. This is because it indicates the rate at which new features are shipped out while helping to foster growth and user adoption.
Will APT’s price reach $9?
For the Aptos crypto, this could be a bullish sign. But data revealed that the metric did not have a solid correlation with APT’s price. Therefore, there is no validation of a further price increase.
In the meantime, Aptos’ Funding Rate was 0.01%. Despite being positive, the rate was lower than what it was a few days ago.
Funding Rate is the cost of holding an open contract in the market. If the reading is positive, it means that the perp price is trading at a premium compared to the spot value.
Source: Santiment
On the other hand,  the negative reading means that the perp price is at a discount compared to the spot price. However, since the perp price moved lower while APT price increased, it means perp traders are not convinced of a price increase.

Realistic or not, here’s APT’s market cap in SOL terms

The reasonable inference is that spot traders are getting aggressive. Thus, this could be bullish for Aptos crypto price.
By the looking things, the price of APT could hit $9 in the short term. However, that would only be the case if selling pressure does not come into play.

Australian rapper Iggy Azalea is set to enhance the utility of her recently launched cryptocurrency, Mother Iggy (MOTHER), by integrating it into a new telecommunications venture. This initiative, announced less than a month after the token's release, aims to allow users to purchase phones and services with MOTHER tokens, marking a significant step in the token’s evolution.Azalea shared her excitement on X, revealing that she would be relaunching the telecommunications company she cofounded. She mentioned that customers would be able to purchase phones or month-to-month cell plans using MOTHER or Solana (SOL), with an ad campaign and rollout planned for later in the week. This statement indicates a strategic expansion of MOTHER token's applications, potentially increasing its adoption and value. In a follow-up tweet, Azalea specified that Unreal Mobile would be the service provider for these phones. She mentioned a variety of phones would be available for purchase if required. Sphere Labs, responsible for the payment infrastructure, will manage the transactions, although it currently does not have its own native token. MOTHER token’s trajectoryIntroduced in late May on the Solana blockchain, the MOTHER token initially experienced volatile trading due to uncertainty about its true issuer. Despite this, the token has started to gain traction, bolstered by strategic moves and utility expansions. The launch of a MOTHER merchandise store last week contributed to a rally in the token’s value.This latest development has further boosted MOTHER’s market performance, with the token appreciating 20.96% in the past 24 hours, surpassing gains in the broader meme coin sector, according to CoinMarketCap data. The coin is currently trading at $0.1835, and it has surged by 837.07% since its launch last month.The relaunch of Azalea’s telecommunications company with MOTHER token integration could significantly enhance the token’s practical use, transforming it from a speculative asset into a functional currency. If successful, this initiative could set a new standard for other celebrities and influencers looking to embed their cryptocurrencies into real-world products and services.

XRP Among Top Performers in $2 Billion Surge in Crypto Investment Product Inflows | Cryptoglobe


                                
James Butterfill, Head of Research at European digit asset investment firm CoinShares, reported in a blog post published earlier today a $2 billion inflow into digital asset investment products over the past week. This influx extends the recent five-week trend of positive inflows, now totaling $4.3 billion. Trading volumes in Exchange Traded Products (ETPs) rose sharply, reaching $12.8 billion for the week, a notable 55% increase from the previous week.



Bitcoin remained the primary focus, drawing in $1.97 billion in inflows within the week. This substantial investment underscores Bitcoin’s continued dominance in the digital asset market. Conversely, short-Bitcoin products experienced outflows for the third consecutive week, totaling $5.3 million. Ethereum also saw notable activity, with $68.9 million in inflows, marking its best week since March. This surge is likely in response to the SEC’s unexpected decision to approve spot-based ETFs, which has boosted investor confidence.



Regionally, the United States led the inflows, contributing $1.98 billion. The first day of the week recorded the third-largest daily inflow on record, highlighting strong investor activity. The iShares Bitcoin ETF emerged as a significant player, now surpassing Grayscale with $21 billion in Assets under Management (AuM).



Butterfill noted the broad-based nature of the inflows. “Unusually, inflows were seen across almost all providers, with a continued slowdown in outflows from incumbents. We believe this turnaround in sentiment is a direct response to weaker-than-expected macro data in the US, bringing forward monetary policy rate cut expectations,” Butterfill stated.







            
            

            
            

            
            

        

Altcoins also attracted some attention. Fantom and XRP were notable, with Fantom seeing inflows of $1.4 million and XRP $1.2 million. This diversified interest indicates broader confidence in the digital asset market.



In terms of providers, iShares ETFs in the USA led with $948 million in inflows, followed by Fidelity ETFs with $680 million. Grayscale Investments faced outflows of $29 million, indicating a shift towards other providers like iShares.



The overall positive price action has driven total assets under management above the $100 billion mark for the first time since March this year. This milestone reflects renewed investor confidence in digital assets, supported by significant inflows into major cryptocurrencies and notable participation from altcoins and regional markets.

Ethereum Is 'Either Building Capitalism Or Planned Socialism' But Cannot Do Both, Criticizes Crypto VC - Benzinga

Wintermute CEO Evgeny Gaevoy has publicly criticized Ethereum ETH/USD leaders, including co-founder Vitalik Buterin and Uniswap‘s Hayden Adams, for their perceived ideological contradictions between capitalist and socialist principles.What Happened: Gaevoy expressed his views on social media, highlighting the inherent tension within the Ethereum community.“If ETH fails in the future it won’t be because ‘Solana is faster,’ it will be because the ETH ‘elite’ is still stuck in a massive contradiction,” Gaevoy stated. He argued that blockchain technology is inherently suited to create capitalist incentive-based systems but pointed out that leaders like Buterin and Adams are attempting to reconcile these systems with socialist ideals.Gaevoy’s critique centers on the efforts to balance financial incentives with broader social goals. “Vitalik, Hayden and many others are trying to ‘solve capitalism’ by saying that what we build can only be respected ‘if the end is worthy (healthcare, open source software, art, etc.),'” he noted.He also criticized ongoing attempts to address Miner Extractable Value (MEV), describing them as efforts to “solve” capitalism.“You are either building capitalism or planned socialism. I’m sorry, you really can’t have both,” Gaevoy asserted. He concluded by expressing his preference for capitalism, despite its flaws, stating, “I choose capitalism in all its (often ugly!) glory. And if you are not here for glory, then one simple argument is – unlike socialism, capitalism actually works.”Also Read: Bitcoin Peak of $120,000 By Late 2024, Major Alt Season To Follow: BitfinexIn contrast, Uniswap UNI/USD CEO Hayden Adams has defended the broader purpose of blockchain technology. “The underlying purpose and value of the tech goes way beyond financial games. And the best builders in the space are motivated by positive social change,” Adams said. He emphasized that the value of projects should not be judged solely by their financial success but also by their potential to contribute to societal good.These discussions highlight a fundamental debate within the crypto community about the role of blockchain technology and its broader societal implications.Such debates and their potential impacts on the future of digital assets will be key topics at the Benzinga Future of Digital Assets event on Nov. 19, where industry leaders will explore these and other critical issues.Read Next: Can Bitcoin Reach $83,000?

Abra CEO Says Bitcoin Is a Solution to Centuries-Old Problem of Fiat Currency and Rule by Decree - The Daily Hodl


								The chief executive of crypto exchange Abra believes that Bitcoin (BTC) is the antidote to hundreds of years of monetary debasement.
In a new Kitco News interview, Bill Barhydt says that history’s greatest powers built their empires with sound monetary policy.










But the Abra CEO says world powers eventually betray the trust of its people by resorting to currency devaluation.
“After World War II, the intent was there would be a certain amount of gold, countries would give us their gold – to the victor goes the spoils. We would print dollars commensurate with a certain value of that gold, and you knew how much your money was worth, and the underlying assets were protected. 
That was the grand bargain. 
Throughout history, every world power has reneged on that or a similar bargain, time after time.”
According to Barhydt, Bitcoin fixes the problem of currency debasement that has plagued powerful nations for centuries. Barhydt notes that BTC’s finite supply, predictable inflation and decentralization can serve as the foundation of a strong global financial system.
“When you look at it from that perspective, you could actually make a case now where: I get the math, the math proves that it’s out there; I get the scalability, because Satoshi said that over time you could actually put more data through the blockchain; and I get the decentralization of having clusters of miners… 
When I brought it all together I was like, ‘This is exactly how money should work.’ It was incredible… This is it. If the world can figure this out what this is really all about, it will change how banking works…
This network belongs to the people. You can’t shut it off. That’s the last piece of the puzzle. If you have no off switch and it belongs to the people, you now have the answer to the hundreds-year-old problem, which is how do you get rid of this fiat, this rule-by-decree monetary model that we’ve had for hundreds of years.”

South Korea Takes Aim: NFTs Now Subject To Regulation


								South Korea’s Financial Services Commission (FSC) has unveiled a new regulatory framework for non-fungible tokens (NFTs). The guidelines, issued ahead of the upcoming Virtual Asset User Protection Act taking effect on July 19th, 2024, aim to bring clarity and structure to the burgeoning NFT market while safeguarding investors and fostering responsible innovation.

Fungibility Takes Center Stage
The core of the FSC’s approach hinges on the concept of fungibility – an NFT’s ability to be exchanged for another identical NFT. NFTs that are mass-produced, divisible, and function primarily as a means of payment will be classified as virtual assets and subject to regulations similar to cryptocurrencies.





In a thought-provoking interview, Jeon Yo-seop, the architect behind financial innovation at the FSC, hinted at a mind-blowing possibility: a digital vault overflowing with 1 million NFTs, functioning not just as collectibles but as currency itself!
However, the FSC, ever the cautious guardian, stressed that each NFT collection will be scrutinized like a unique fingerprint, with no one-size-fits-all approach to classifying them as crypto.
A Spectrum Of NFT Regulation





The FSC recognizes the diverse applications of NFTs. Unique, non-divisible NFTs with minimal monetary value, such as those used for concert tickets or digital certificates, will likely be categorized as “general NFTs” and exempt from stricter regulations.
The guidelines also leave room for NFTs to be classified as securities if they exhibit characteristics outlined in South Korea’s Capital Markets Act. This nuanced approach ensures that the regulations adapt to the evolving nature of NFTs within the digital landscape.
Businesses Beware: Compliance Is Key
NFT businesses in South Korea are advised to carefully scrutinize the FSC’s guidelines to determine if their offerings qualify as virtual assets. Companies dealing in such NFTs will need to comply with the Specific Financial Information Act, which governs the sale, exchange, transfer, storage, and brokerage of virtual assets.
BTC is now trading at $69,341. Chart: TradingView
Failure to adhere to these regulations could result in hefty fines or even criminal penalties. The FSC acknowledges the potential complexities for businesses and has pledged to offer consultation services to assist them in navigating the new regulatory landscape. This includes providing real-world examples and case studies to help businesses confidently classify their NFTs.
South Korea’s NFT Market Poised For Growth
The NFT market in South Korea is expected to grow significantly, with the NFT spend value projected to increase from $938 million in 2022 to $4 billion by 2028, representing a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 34%.

The country has seen a surge in NFT adoption, with the number of NFT owners growing from 10,000 in 2020 to 760,000 in 2021 and projected to reach 970,000 in 2024 and 1.02 million by 2025, according to latest data.

Shiba Inu Price Could Skyrocket By 1,100%, Predicts Analyst


																In an analysis, Moataz “Eljaboom” Elsayed, a crypto analyst and Forbes 40 under 40 nominee, has forecasted a significant surge in the value of Shiba Inu (SHIB). According to Elsayed, the meme-based cryptocurrency is poised for a potential increase that could see its value reach $0.00024, marking an unprecedented 1,105% gain from its current levels.
Shiba Inu Price Set To Skyrocket 1,100%?
In a review of SHIB’s price activity on the weekly chart (SHIB/USDT), Elsayed pinpointed a repeating pattern that initially occurred during the second quarter of 2021, shortly after Binance, a major crypto exchange, began trading SHIB. According to him, Shiba Inu’s historical data is exhibiting a pattern that, if repeated, will propel its price to new heights. He noted that the cryptocurrency experienced a notable rise to $0.00005 during the week of May 10, 2021, following its listing on Binance.

	Related Reading


Elsayed’s analysis draws attention to a critical period in SHIB’s market behavior. After reaching a high of $0.00005, the token underwent a correction, settling below a pivotal support range of $0.00001784 to $0.00001995 for nearly 120 days. However, a subsequent breakout occurred in October 2021 as the broader bull market gained momentum, catapulting SHIB by 343.64% from its support level to a peak of $0.00008854.

The subsequent correction and entry into a bear market, exacerbated by the collapse of the Terra ecosystem in May 2022, saw SHIB prices fall below key support levels. It remained subdued under these levels for 658 days, struggling to surpass the $0.00001 mark. Yet, a resurgence in March of this year saw SHIB soar by more than 370% to a yearly high of $0.00004567.
Building on this data, Elsayed anticipates a similar, if not more pronounced, trajectory for SHIB in the near future. He estimates that this next breakout could propel SHIB’s price to $0.0002404, effectively increasing its market capitalization to $141.6 billion. Given the cyclical nature of the crypto market, such could be on the cards, according to the crypto analyst.

In the daily SHIB/USD chart, Shiba Inu’s price is currently in a consolidation phase, following a significant rally to this year’s high in early March. Despite breaking out of a symmetrical triangle pattern in mid-May, SHIB failed to sustain a close above the 0.382 Fibonacci retracement level of $0.00002883.
Subsequent to this rejection, the price fell below the 0.236 Fibonacci level and is now struggling to establish support at the 100-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA). Maintaining a daily close above $0.00002326 is critical to prevent a potential further decline towards the 200-day EMA at $0.00001977.

Bitcoin struggles: How long do you need to wait for a rally? - AMBCrypto



Bitcoin’s daily active addresses recently spiked to over 700,000.
The price has yet to see any significant moves on either side.

Bitcoin’s [BTC] price has not shown any exciting trends in the last few days. It’s not just the price trend that has been lackluster; the address metrics have also been dull over the past few weeks.
Bitcoin briefly breaks trend
The number of daily active addresses for Bitcoin has been in decline over the past few months, but recently, there was a break in this trend. 
AMBCrypto’s analysis of the daily active addresses chart on Santiment showed that the general trend has been downward since around March. 
For instance, on the 5th of March, the number of daily active addresses was over 1 million. Soon thereafter, this number fell to the 900,000 range and then further to the 600,000 range.
Source: Santiment
However, there was a brief break from this downtrend at the end of the past week. The aforementioned chart showed that the number of daily active addresses spiked to over 765,000 on the 8th of June. 
Despite this spike, the momentum was not sustained, and the number fell back to around 619,000 by the 9th of June. As of this writing, the number of daily active addresses was 110,000.
New wallets decline
AMBCrypto’s analysis of the new addresses chart on Glassnode showed that Bitcoin has been experiencing a similar downtrend. However, this downtrend began earlier, in January. 
At the start of 2024, the number of daily new addresses was over 500,000. By the end of May, this number had fallen to less than 300,000.
Source: Glassnode
As of this writing, the analysis showed that the number of new addresses was trying to pick up, but it could only rise to around 254,000. 
The correlation here is clear: the drop in the number of daily active addresses and the decline in new addresses has hindered any significant momentum. 
Consequently, the price of BTC has remained the same in the last few days.
Flat moves
AMBCrypto’s analysis of Bitcoin on a daily time frame chart showed that its price has yet to pick up steam.

At the end of trading on the 9th of June, Bitcoin saw a modest 0.43% increase, keeping its value at around $69,683.

However, as of this writing, it has slipped slightly to around $69,600 after a minor decline. This lack of significant movement has contributed to the drop in both active and new addresses.

Bitcoin's (BTC) Resilience


Last Friday, Bitcoin’s price fell from $72,000 to $69,000, causing a 10% average drop across many cryptocurrencies. This sharp decline has caused the market to be concerned, leading to questions about what’s driving these changes and how investors are reacting. To better understand what might happen next, we’re looking at on-chain data for clearer insights.
Bitcoin’s Whale Activity: Insights Into the Market’s Silent Movers
The on-chain data indicates that whales, the large holders of Bitcoin, are not only retaining their holdings but are also increasing their supply. This strategic accumulation during price dips suggests that these influential market players view the current lower prices as favorable buying opportunities. 

Their actions can significantly impact market sentiment and price stabilization, hinting that they may foresee a potential rebound or at least do not expect further significant declines in the short term.

The changes in Bitcoin balance across different cohorts show notable increases.

Specifically, addresses holding 100 to 1,000 BTC saw an increase of 30,601 BTC, those with 1,000 to 10,000 BTC increased by 34,834 BTC, and the largest holders, those with over 10,000 BTC, increased their balances by 24,176 BTC. 
These significant increases suggest that larger Bitcoin holders are accumulating more BTC during the recent market correction.
BTC Current Price: Watching the Critical Support Level
The average acquisition price for Bitcoin bought between one day and three months ago is $67,500. Bitcoins bought within this timeframe account for 17% of the total circulating supply. 
Should the price fall below this level, it could potentially initiate a cascade of sell-offs as investors rush to minimize losses.If the price falls below the $67,500 level, it may find support in the $61,000 – $62,000 range, which aligns with the realized price of significant wallet cohorts.
The “realized price” is a financial metric that estimates the average cost at which all Bitcoins in circulation were last moved or transacted. Unlike the “market price,” which fluctuates based on trading activity, the realized price provides insight into what investors paid for their holdings, aggregating this data across all Bitcoins.

If the market price falls below the realized price, it could indicate that, on average, 17% of the circulating Bitcoin supply is held at a loss. This situation might prompt selling pressure as investors attempt to minimize their losses. 
On the other hand, if the market price remains above this realized price, 17% of the Bitcoin supply will be in profit. This incentivizes holders to retain their positions for extended periods, potentially signaling a positive trend for the market.A price surge toward the $72,000 level could be decisive this time, potentially leading to an all-time high breakout in the mid-term. 
As detailed in the analysis, this scenario is plausible if Bitcoin can hold its position above the $67,500 support level.

ZKSync introduces ZK Nation, a 'community-driven' governance system - Crypto Briefing


            
            
                            
            
                            
            
            Ethereum Layer 2 network ZKSync has unveiled a new “community-driven” governance system called ZK Nation. The introduction of ZK Nation coincides with the project’s plans to conduct its token generation event and an airdrop this month, which is expected to further decentralize the network.According to the new system’s blog post, the community is “driven by a shared purpose to govern, defend, and grow the ZKSync protocol.”The new governance system will enable ZKSync token holders to actively participate in the protocol’s development by introducing proposals, voting on protocol upgrades, and deliberating on network parameter changes. ZKSync is developed by Matter Labs, a protocol development firm which recently came under fire from the crypto industry for its zero-knowledge trademark bid.According to ZK Nation, the new governance system will showcase the importance of maintaining “strong social and technical decentralization guarantees,” which ostensibly create a framework for evaluating the maturity of rollups.ZK Nation will operate through three onchain governance bodies: the Token Assembly, the Security Council, and the Guardians. These governance bodies will operate within different legal structures to ensure maximum protection for the Token Assembly and will interact with ZKSync’s smart contracts and coordination channels, such as the initial delegation and voting portal on Tally.The Token Assembly will include token holders who delegate their voting power to representatives, while the Guardians will act as protectors of the ZK Credo’s values by exercising their veto power and initiating or approving emergency actions related to the ZKSync network.The Security Council, composed of highly technical and skilled professionals, will safeguard the protocol and network’s technical security by providing technical reviews for approved protocol upgrades.ZKSync claims to be committed to driving innovation forward with zero-knowledge proofs, facilitating a continuously growing, verifiable blockchain network that provides digital sovereignty to billions based on a protocol rooted in integrity and security.

Here's when Shiba Inu will hit 1 cent, according to ChatGPT-4o


    Meme cryptocurrency Shiba Inu (SHIB) is experiencing short-term price volatility amid a sharp correction that occurred on June 7. 



Despite current price movements, SHIB investors are focused on witnessing the token reduce the number of zeros in its price, with the one-cent mark remaining a likely target.



Based on SHIB’s underlying fundamentals, reaching this level is challenging. However, Finbold turned to OpenAI’s latest and most advanced artificial intelligence (AI) tool, ChatGPT-4o, to gather insights on when SHIB might hit $0.01.







To predict the timeline, the AI platform first acknowledged the underlying factors likely to propel SHIB to $0.01. ChatGPT-4o noted that market sentiment plays a crucial role, as cryptocurrencies can experience rapid price changes due to shifts in investor sentiment.



Increased adoption and new use cases can drive demand, significantly influencing the price of SHIB alongside regulatory changes. Moreover, technological developments within the Shiba Inu ecosystem can attract more investors, driving the price upward.



SHIB price targets



The AI tool noted that Shiba Inu would require major adoption, a strong bull market, and perhaps major technological or partnership developments to reach $0.01. Given its current price of $0.00002325, it would need to increase by approximately 430 times.



Optimistically, the AI platform assumed that in the event of a strong bull market and significant positive developments, it could take several years, with a timeline of 5-10 years.



In this case, to attain the $0.01 mark, SHIB will need to undergo significant buying pressure. Therefore, If Shiba Inu reaches a price of 1 cent, the market cap would be approximately $5.88 trillion.



Although ChatGPT-4o cited the challenge of attaining the $0.01 mark, it projected the most likely highest price level for SHIB. The tool noted that the price target would still be contingent on massive adoption and market dynamics.



According to ChatGPT-4o, assuming a highly optimistic market scenario, SHIB could potentially see a 10x to 100x increase from current levels. This would put SHIB in the range of $0.00023 to $0.0023 as the most realistic highest price target.

In the meantime, it’s worth noting that the Shiba Inu community has implemented measures to help the token gain momentum and compete. For instance, Shiba Inu heavily relies on initiatives such as token burning to provide more sustainability. 



For instance, in early June, the token increased about 16,600% in token burning. Overall, the burn mechanisms are meant to reduce the overall supply of SHIB in circulation, potentially enhancing its value.



Shiba Inu price analysis



At press time, Shiba Inu was trading at $0.00002315, having corrected by over 7% in the last seven days.

In summary, SHIB’s price has generally been trending downwards from June 6th onwards. Notably, watching the price action around $0.000025 and $0.0000245 will be important, as breaking through these resistance points could lead to a possible bullish breakout.



On the flip side, observing how the price interacts with the $0.000023 and $0.0000225 support levels can offer buying opportunities.

Critical Statement from Solana Foundation: 'Malicious Verifiers Will Be Sanctioned!' Here are the Details - Bitcoin Sistemi


The Solana Foundation removed a group of validator operators from its authorization program after they were involved in malicious sandwich attacks against Solana users.
Solana Foundation Removes Validators from Authentication Program Due to Malicious Attacks
Solana Validator Relations Lead Tim Garcia announced the decision on the Solana Foundation's Discord server and said, “Decisions on this matter are final. Enforcement actions will continue as we identify operators participating in Mempools that allow sandwich attacks.”


The removal is intended to ensure that the foundation does not authorize validators who engage in harmful activities.
Mert Mümtaz, co-founder of Solana RPC provider Helius, explained that this move is crucial to protect retail users from such malicious applications.





A type of front-running exploit, sandwich attacks involve an attacker placing two transactions around a victim's transaction to manipulate prices and profit from the difference.

As noted in Garcia's May 7 Discord post, these attacks are clearly against the rules set by the Solana Foundation.


“Operators who engage in malicious activity, such as participating in a private Mempool for sandwich attack operations or otherwise harming Solana users, will not be tolerated by the delegation program.
Anyone found to be engaging in such activities will be rejected from the program and any shares from the Foundation will be immediately and permanently removed,” Garcia emphasized during the announcement.





The Solana Foundation Delegation Program supports validators by delegating SOL tokens to them, reducing the need for validators to hold significant amounts of tokens. Validators are selected based on performance and are expected to adhere to good practices.

DeFi Platform UwU Lend Suffers $19.5 Million Crypto Hack


UwU Lend, a decentralized finance (DeFi) lending platform, has reportedly lost over $19.5 million to a crypto hack. The Web3 security firm Cyvers identified and reported this alarming incident. 
As cyber threats escalate, this theft highlights the crypto industry’s persistent vulnerabilities.
UwU Lend Becomes Latest Crypto Vulnerability

As of this writing, the platform is still under attack. In an interview with BeInCrypto, Cyvers co-founder Meir Dolev shed light on the incident.

“The UwU lending contract was exploited by an attacker that executed 3 transactions in 6 minutes and drained approximately $20 million. Attacker was funded from Tornado cash 2 days ago,” Dolev told BeInCrypto

Currently, UwU Lend has not publicly addressed the specifics of the breach. This silence has sparked concern among users and stakeholders about the platform’s security measures and response strategies. 
Over the past year, numerous security breaches have besieged the crypto community. These incidents have led to substantial financial losses, highlighting the need for security protocols within DeFi platforms.
According to a recent report by Immunefi, in 2024, the industry has endured approximately $473.22 million in losses from 108 incidents up to May. Notably, the month of May witnessed $52.37 million being siphoned off through 21 separate incidents. This surge in attacks highlights the growing appeal of DeFi platforms to cybercriminals, driven by the substantial funds these platforms manage.

Ethereum’s Pectra Upgrade May Be Split Into Two Forks - The Defiant

Developers have already penciled in nine EIPs for inclusion in Ethereum's next hard fork.With Ethereum’s forthcoming Pectra upgrade shaping up to be the most expansive in the network’s history, developers are considering splitting its deployment over two separate hard forks.Following the latest All Core Devs Execution call on June 6, Christine Kim, a researcher at Galaxy Digital, tweeted that developers are exploring executing the upgrade over two forks.Kim noted that nine Ethereum Improvement Proposals (EIPs) are already confirmed for inclusion, with an additional five upgrades under consideration. She added that the upgrades are being staged in batches across devnet implementations, enabling Pectra’s scope to expand in the lead-up to deployment.“It is A LOT for one upgrade, so there's still a good chance Pectra gets split,” Kim said. “Staging multiple EIPs for implementation on devnets is a new development for the Ethereum governance process that leaves the door open for an upgrade with an ever-changing scope.”Pectra’s upcoming Devnet 1 will include the same eight EIPs tested on Devnet 0.Disruptive changesAccording to Vitalik Buterin, Ethereum’s chief scientist, Pectra is among the last upgrades expected to introduce disruptive changes to Ethereum.“After scaling is done, we’re in a stage where the hardest and fastest parts of the Ethereum protocol’s transition are essentially over,” Buterin said during an Ethereum Foundation livestream in April 2023. “Various things will need to be done, but those… things can be safely done at a slower pace.”Five execution layer upgrades and four consensus layer upgrades have been “finalized” for inclusion as part of Pectra so far, spanning an eclectic assortment of EIPs dating as far back as 2020.Verkle Trees and statelessnessEIP-2935 is a critical component of Pectra required to facilitate the introduction of Verkle Trees and statelessness. Verkle Trees will remove the need for nodes to store the network’s state locally, significantly reducing the computational requirements on validators.According to Kim, developers are also working on three related “parallel upgrades” that are likely to be bundled into Pectra.These include the development of validator light clients, which do not download the entire Ethereum blockchain. Light clients are intended to improve the decentralization of Ethereum by allowing users to validate the network using "resource-constrained devices such as tablets and cell phones.”With nodes no longer required to store the entire block history of Ethereum, EIP-4444 would also formalize the deletion of historic data from full nodes after a set amount of time, further reducing the computational demands for validators in a bid to improve node decentralization.“With EIP-4444: History Expiry, you would not have to store most of the history locally,” said Buterin. “The amount of data that you would need to be a node would decrease from multiple terabytes to... being able to run a node in RAM.”DApps and other nodes that need to access deleted block history would be able to query third-party data services following EIP-4444’s deployment.Developers are also exploring PeerDAS, which would provide further Layer 2 data availability following the introduction of proto-danksharding in March.Consensus layer upgradesMany of the upgrades set for inclusion in Pectra seek to improve the functionality and efficiency of Ethereum staking.EIP-6110 aims to decrease the delay between stakers depositing collateral on the Ethereum mainnet execution layer and the corresponding transaction processing on the Beacon Chain. It would also reduce the complexity of validator client software.EIP-7251 aims to slow the growth and reduce the size of Ethereum’s validator set to bolster the network's security. EIP-7002 would expand the number of designs available to developers creating staking pools.EIP-7549 targets improving the efficiency of attestations, which would reduce network load and node bandwidth demands.Execution layer upgradesOn the execution layer, EIP-2537 and EIP-7865 would bolster interoperability between the Ethereum mainnet and its Beacon Chain consensus layer. This would expand the functionality of decentralized staking pools, DAOs, and dApps that communicate with the Beacon Chain for staking functions.A bundle of ten EIPs relating to EVM Object Format (EOF) aims to facelift the Ethereum Virtual Machine, Ethereum’s core smart contract engine. EOF would improve the upgradability of EVM contracts alongside the efficiency of smart contract code execution.EIP-7702 is a controversial upgrade that would enable “smart account” features for regular externally owned account (EOA) wallets. The upgrade would enable batched transaction execution, transaction fee sponsoring, and delegated wallet security, but critics have warned the upgrade could make users vulnerable to new attack vectors.“It's important to note that devs are staging the implementation of Pectra EIPs, meaning if EOF or EIP-7702 or PeerDAS don't make it into a devnet over the coming months, devs may drop it entirely from the upgrade or split out Pectra into two hard forks,” Kim said.Unconfirmed upgradesKim noted two additional consensus layer upgrades that developers have not yet confirmed for inclusion in Pectra.EIP-7688 would make it easier for staking pools to verify whether a participating validator has been slashed.Developers may also consider reducing the rate of new Ether issuance. Mike Neuder, an Ethereum Foundation researcher, recently advocated for such a move, arguing that the Ethereum network and ecosystem has undergone “Seismic” change since Ether’s staking rewards mechanism was finalized amid the lead-up to the Beacon Chain’s deployment in 2020.However, the proposal quickly proved divisive, with many community members pushing back against Nueder’s suggestion. Some onlookers feared it could open the door to Ethereum Foundation researchers frequently meddling with the network’s tokenomics without input from the broader community.

Walmart and Mohawk Industries Receive Analyst Upgrades, Gain in Premarket - Tokenist


					
Neither the author, Tim Fries, nor this website, The Tokenist, provide financial advice. Please consult our website policy prior to making financial decisions.



Walmart (NYSE: WMT) and Mohawk Industries (NYSE: MHK) have received positive analyst upgrades from JPMorgan and Raymond James, respectively, reflecting strong outlooks and favorable market positions.



JPMorgan upgraded Walmart to “Overweight” with a price target of $81, citing expectations of multi-year double-digit EPS growth, while Raymond James upgraded Mohawk Industries to “Strong Buy” with a price target of $140, based on a positive outlook and historical valuation metrics.



Both companies have shown recent stock price increases in premarket trading, despite varying macroeconomic challenges, and are supported by analyst optimism and strategic positioning in their respective sectors.



JPMorgan Upgrades Walmart to “Overweight”, Sets $81 Price Target



JPMorgan has upgraded Walmart’s stock rating from “Neutral” to “Overweight”, reflecting a strong balance of defense and offense for the retail giant.



The firm increased Walmart’s price target from $66 to $81, citing expectations of multi-year double-digit EPS growth driven by market share gains and international segment profit inflection. Walmart’s fiscal year forecast was raised in May following better-than-expected quarterly results, with anticipated benefits from higher-margin alternative profit pools.



The upgrade also considers macroeconomic factors such as a softening consumer backdrop and an uncertain second half of 2024.



Walmart’s stock has risen 31.76% year-to-date as of the last close, with 37 of 40 analysts rating the stock as “buy” or higher, and a median price target of $71.50. The company’s EPS forecast for 2024 is maintained at $2.57, above the Wall Street consensus of $2.43.



Walmart’s stock rose by 1.44% in premarket trading on June 10, 2024 at the time of writing, reflecting its strong performance and significant returns over the past five years, outpacing the S&P 500. 





Raymond James Upgrades Mohawk Industries to “Strong Buy”, Sets $140 Price Target



Raymond James has upgraded Mohawk Industries’ stock rating from “Market Perform” to “Strong Buy”, setting a new price target of $140.00.



The upgrade is based on a positive outlook and historical valuation metrics, reflecting a strong correlation between Mohawk’s stock performance and FNA margins. The recent decrease in WTI prices since the Q1 financial report is considered a positive factor, and Mohawk’s shares are viewed as below net asset appraised/replacement value, offering a favorable risk-reward balance.



Mohawk Industries reported mixed Q1 2024 results, with net sales decreasing by 4.5% to $2.7 billion, while adjusted EPS rose by 6% to $1.86. Despite challenges in the residential remodeling sector, the company remains optimistic about a market recovery in the second half of the year. Jefferies upgraded Mohawk’s stock price target to $130.00, maintaining a “Hold” rating.



The firm’s market capitalization stands at $7.24 billion, with a forward-looking P/E ratio adjusted to 13.31 and a solid gross profit margin of 25.44%.



MHK increased by 2.27% in premarket trading on June 10, 2024, despite a challenging macroeconomic backdrop. The company’s financials reveal a mixed picture with a negative net income and profit margin, but significant free cash flow.



Analyst price targets range from $108 to $145, focusing on potential recovery and value investing strategies. Mohawk’s performance reflects its positioning in the furnishings, fixtures, and appliances sector, with strategic measures in place to navigate market challenges.

Subscribe now to Alpha Reports and up your game!Go to Alpha ReportsRoaring Kitty is posting on Twitter again, pushing GME up 5% in pre-market trading. But, some internet detectives believe that he’s hinting that he owns stock in AMC.After posting a single tweet a week ago, returning to Reddit on Thursday, and livestreaming on Friday, the GameStop bull is back to posting movie references.Keith Gill, better known as Roaring Kitty or DeepFuckingValue, was at the center of the GameStop short squeeze in 2021—forever tying his name to the company.But, due to his longtime habit of communicating through movie references on Twitter, people are starting to believe he also owns AMC—another meme stock popularized in 2021.His latest post is a screenshot from the opening shot of the Batman movie “The Dark Knight,” showing Heath Ledger’s Joker character holding a kitten mask right before he robs a bank. Some Twitter detectives have taken particular interest in the mask, believing there are hidden numbers and messages within the kitten's fur.Many people see the number five on the mask which they believe is due to AMC’s stock price currently hovering around $5. Others see the word AMC written on the mask. However the original photo of the kitten has been found, debunking the theory that RoaringKitty added any hidden messages in the mask.That hasn’t stopped people believing that Roaring Kitty holds AMC. This belief is only strengthened by a clip from Roaring Kitty’s livestream where he speaks about movies, almost begging the audience to read between the lines.“Oh movies, alright let's go! Yeah movies… yeah, now we’re talking!” He said smirking at the viewer, “Just random things.”AMC opened at $5.30 on Friday morning, dropping 7.4% by close to $4.91 and is largely unmoved in pre-market trading. While GameStop opened at $37.69 but after a disappointing Q1 report and Roaring Kitty’s stream the stock dropped 25% to $28.22. However, in pre-market, GME is up 5% to $29.59.This comes following the meme stock influencer’s return to social media last week. After posting an Uno card on Twitter, he posted on the Reddit community Superstonk showing his purported GameStop positions totalling $586 million.He then scheduled a livestream for Friday with some theorizing he could become a GameStop billionaire on stream. Unfortunately for Gill, the company’s Q1 report was released early and sent GME crashing 30%, putting a damper on the party. Despite this, the meme stock influencer still garnered over 700,000 viewers as the price of GameStop fell.Edited by Stacy Elliott.Daily Debrief NewsletterStart every day with the top news stories right now, plus original features, a podcast, videos and more.

Euro Power Play: Ripple and Clear Junction Team up for Faster Cross-Border Payments


							

Ripple’s partnership with Clear Junction facilitates secure payouts in GBP and EUR, enhancing XRP’s utility in European transactions.



Despite short-term market corrections, XRP shows resilience with a slight price increase, signaling potential for future growth.



Analysts foresee a promising trajectory for XRP, anticipating a powerful upward movement amid potential market fluctuations.




Ripple is forging deeper ties within the European financial sector through a strategic partnership with Clear Junction, a leading provider of international payment solutions for regulated institutions. The collaboration aims to simplify cross-border transactions by enabling fast and secure payouts in Euros and British pounds, with plans to expand to additional currencies in the future.



As cryptocurrency expert EDO Farina points out, Ripple’s long-term vision aligns with David Schwartz’s recent essay, which emphasizes the gradual pace of change within international banking. Schwartz states, “Revolutionizing international finance isn’t something that you expect to happen overnight.”







This partnership positions XRP as a frontrunner in Europe by integrating it into Clear Junction’s payment infrastructure. The collaboration underscores Ripple’s commitment to boosting XRP’s utility and adoption among regulated financial institutions across the continent.



Despite recent market corrections, XRP exhibits resilience, with a minor price increase amidst broader volatility. Analyst Matthew Dixon suggests XRP is currently undergoing a corrective phase, potentially preceding a significant upward move. While bullish on XRP’s long-term prospects, Dixon acknowledges potential short-term fluctuations, such as those influenced by upcoming Consumer Price Index (CPI) data.







XRP is currently priced at $0.4974, with a trading volume of $514,062,852.64. It has gained 0.58% in the last 24 hours but remains down 3.89% over the past week. Despite these short-term movements, analysts maintain a positive outlook on XRP’s future performance.









Ripple’s strategic alliance with Clear Junction marks a significant step toward wider XRP adoption within European finance. As Ripple continues to forge partnerships and enhance XRP’s functionalities, the crypto asset is expected to experience steady growth and gain wider recognition within the international financial system.

Will BONK See a Multi-Month Low Due to Investors’ Skepticism?


BONK price will likely witness a bearish outcome as the meme coin craze is seemingly ending. 
The enthusiasm among meme coin holders is declining rapidly, which is visible in their actions.
BONK Investors Pull Back 

BONK’s price enjoyed its holders’ optimism, but as the macro conditions turn unfavorable for the crypto market, this optimism seems to be fading away. This is clearly evident in the weighted sentiment of all BONK investors.
This metric combines and analyses all the mentions and expressions pertaining to a topic. The data helps to provide a more nuanced view of public opinion or investor sentiment. Upticks suggest bullishness, while downticks hint at bearishness.
In the case of BONK, the investors’ sentiment, which turned bearish at the beginning of the month, is intensifying.

The impact of this intensifying skepticism is visible in the meme coin’s funding rate. The funding rate is a periodic payment exchanged between traders in a futures contract to keep the contract price aligned with the spot price. 
It reflects the difference between perpetual futures prices and spot prices, where a positive rate indicates a bullish market, and a negative rate indicates a bearish market. Generally, positive rates suggest the dominance of long contracts over short ones and vice versa.
BONK, while maintaining a positive funding rate, is noting a decline. This shows that traders are liquidating and pulling out long contracts.

BONK Funding Rate. Source: Coinglass
As the price drops further, it won’t be surprising to see the funding rate become negative.
BONK Price Prediction: Keeping Above a Key Support

BONK price is holding above the critical support of $0.00002748, a level that has been tested as support and resistance. The chances of a decline below this line are significant, and the meme coin could thus fall to $0.00002153.
The aforementioned conditions do hint at a further decline, although $0.00002000 will act as a support floor. This will potentially prevent BONK from falling any lower.

But if the broader market conditions improve, BONK could capitalize on it and bounce back. Should the breakdown fail or the meme coin recover mid-way, a recovery to $0.00003000 is on the cards. Breaching the same would invalidate the bearish thesis.

AI revises Terra Classic price prediction for end of 2024


    Although many assets in the cryptocurrency market have recorded a successful year so far, this has not been the case for Terra Classic (LUNC), the price of which has been recording poor results on all of its charts and has declined by over 20% since the year’s turn.



Indeed, Terra Classic has been lagging behind the rest of the crypto sector in price, although it has recently started to recover after Binance, one of the largest crypto exchanges in the world, added support for LUNC, according to the official announcement on June 8.



Terra Classic (LUNC) price prediction



In this context, Finbold has consulted several artificial intelligence (AI) platforms, including the recent generative AI models, for insights on the price movements of Terra Classic by the end of this year, all of which agree on one thing – modest price increases are possible.







Specifically, the advanced machine learning algorithms over at the finance and crypto price predicting platform CoinPriceForecast have set the price of Terra Classic at $0.00011696 by the end of 2024, which would represent an increase of 9.77% from its current price, provided it comes true.

Furthermore, the most recent and advanced iteration of the OpenAI invention ChatGPT, called ChatGPT-4o, suggests a price growth to a minimum price of $0.000096 and a maximum of $0.000244, or an average of $0.000118 to $0.000149 by December 2024, adding that:




“These figures take into account the ongoing technical developments, community engagement, and market trends prevalent in the ecosystem.”




Meanwhile, Claude 3 Opus, a recent AI model by Anthropic, has offered the possible Terra Classic year-end price in a range between $0.00004 and $0.00021, citing “optimism within the Terra Classic community as members try to revive the LUNC blockchain project, and the LUNC burn mechanism which is a key driver behind the price rise.”



Finally, Google Gemini, the AI chatbot platform developed by Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOGL), predicts that LUNC could reach a low-end price of $0.00009, “considering analyst predictions and potential short-term dips,” or a high-end price of $0.00025, taking into account potential long-term growth.



Terra Classic price analysis



For now, LUNC is trading at the price of $0.00010655, which indicates a decline of 0.99% on the day, a 10.19% drop across the week, and an increase of 2.61% in the past month, while dropping 23.17% this year, according to the data on June 10.

It is also important to note that crypto analyst Javon Marks is confident that LUNC might be in its early stages of a bullish breakout, projecting it to hit $0.00021439 “at an unprecedented pace,” as he pointed out in an X post in late May.







That said, the crypto sector can sometimes be a volatile and unpredictable space so doing one’s own research, carefully weighing all the risks and individual risk tolerance, as well as keeping up with any relevant developments and news is critical when investing.

Ripple chief executive officer (CTO) David Schwartz has published a crucial scam warning for the XRP army and the global cryptocurrency community.Citing a tweet published by an account that impersonated @loopringorg - the official X handle of the Loopring protocol - the post mentioned a security breach suffered by Loopring and a large amount of customer funds lost to hackers and “user compensation claims.”Image via XSchwartz warned that this was a scam message: “Caution! This is a scam post!” By now, the fake account has been quickly suspended by the X team, and the Ripple CTO edited his original post by adding a link to an actual tweet published by @loopringorg. In that tweet, the project’s team shared details of the incident, explaining what really happened.

Loopring smart wallets breachThe post published by @loopringorg revealed that a few hours ago some Loopring Smart Wallets suffered from a hacker attack. The hacker falsely posed as the wallet owner, resetting ownership and withdrawing assets from the targeted wallets.The hacker attack was successful as the culprits managed to compromise Loopring’s 2FA service and gained approval for the above-mentioned recovery from the Official Loopring Guardian. All operations connected with the Guardian service have been suspended for now, while the team is collaborating with Mist security experts as to how the 2FA service was breached.The Loopring team is now actively working with law enforcement and security experts as they are attempting to track down the hacker. The two hacker addresses were shared in the post as the Loopring team asked the crypto community for assistance: “If you have any information that could help us track down the hacker, please share it with us.”Ripple CTO's earlier scam warningAs reported by U.Today last week, Schwartz addressed the XRP community on a similar issue. He shared a screenshot of a direct message received by another X user, from someone who called themselves the X support team.The message stated that this user’s account was “under investigation for copyright violations” and urged the user to complete a form accessible through the link added to the message. Should the form not be filled out within 24 hours, the scammer claimed, the account would be suspended. The Ripple CTO said that that screenshot was fake.

Solana Mainnet Upgrade Brings Positivity To SOL ETF Appro...


                                What to Expect from Solana's Mainnet Upgrade Amid US Election 2024                                Solana is a leading blockchain platform gearing up for a significant mainnet upgrade to version 1.18.15. This move comes as traders speculate on the potential for SOL's price to surge towards $250.What's The NewsThe Solana team has announced the readiness of the v1.18.15 mainnet upgrade. This upgrade is primarily designed to alleviate congestion problems that have plagued the network, especially with the recent surge in memecoin activities on the Solana blockchain. According to an official post by Solana Status on 10th June validators are encouraged to adopt this new stable release. The update includes several enhancements, such as the addition of certificate authority certificates to the Docker image, bug fixes, and metrics improvements. Additionally, it optimizes the scheduler for worker precompile verification and adjusts logging for shallow threshold checks during the consensus mechanism.Solana Set for Mainnet Launch UpgradeThe Solana v1.18.15 upgrade is a critical step for the network. Validators are instructed to upgrade when delinquent stakes are below 5% and to report any issues. This upgrade aims to ensure smoother network operations and to handle the increased demand effectively. This update is designed to address major congestion problems on the network due to the influx of Solana-based memecoins. Key improvements in this release include adding authority certificates to the docker image, bug fixes, and enhancements to the scheduler for better transaction handling.Impact of Solana Mainnet Upgrade on Solana ETF ApprovalThe Solana v1. 18. 15 mainnet upgrades may help to improve network activity and solve the problem of congestion, which may lead to increased investor trust in Solana’s technology. Therefore, the upgrade is a positive technical move but regulatory and political factors would be more decisive in the approval of Solana ETF.Recently, the approval of Spot Ether ETF brings high expectations for the Approval of Solana ETF. However, the approval of a Solana ETF depends on other regulatory aspects and the results of the US presidential election 2024 that might define the further development of cryptocurrency regulation and the approval of the Solana ETF.Former President Donald Trump, who is campaigning for re-election has voiced support for cryptocurrencies and is termed as the ‘crypto president’. If Trump wins Solana ETF approval might be easier to come by.On the other side, if President Biden is re-elected the cautious approach towards cryptocurrency regulation by SEC Chair Gary Gensler will be continued. This could result in further delays in the approval of Solana ETF due to concerns about market manipulation, liquidity, and centralization.What CoinGabbar Has Concluded?The Solana v1.18.15 mainnet upgrade is a decisive step to increase the network’s performance as the demand continues to rise, which can lead to an SOL price pump. However, other market factors such as the U.S. presidential elections also contribute to the future of Solana ETF approval. The future of cryptocurrencies in the US greatly depends on the result of the presidential election of 2024. These developments should be eyed closely by investors as they will greatly influence the future progress and usage of Solana and othersAlso Read: Trump VS Biden And The Future Of Domestic Bitcoin Mining

Shiba Inu Exec Gives Crucial Statement on SHIB Metaverse


Shiba Inu (SHIB) ecosystem marketing lead Lucie recently made a significant announcement on X regarding the future of the SHIB Metaverse. She highlighted the potential adoption of fully homomorphic encryption (FHE) privacy layers, a technology that could revolutionize the way users interact in the virtual world.Lucie suggested that the SHIB Army might consider incorporating fully homomorphic encryption (FHE) privacy layers into its operating system. She mentioned that FHE technology, specifically Zama in their case, allows data analysis to be performed directly on encrypted data without revealing the private data to the analyzing party. Lucie added that this technology could be applied in the SHIB Metaverse to ensure that users' interactions remain both private and secure by embedding FHE technology within the virtual world. While the option for public interaction will remain, the addition of FHE technology will allow users who prefer to build and engage privately to do so without compromising their data security. This dual approach is expected to enhance the overall user experience, catering to a broader range of preferences within the community.Excitement around Shiba Inu MetaverseLucie’s tweet also recalled her earlier excitement in March, when she hinted at significant plans for the Shiba Inu Metaverse, including the introduction of a new token, TREAT. Notably, TREAT is set to play a crucial role in the ecosystem, designed to serve multiple purposes, including providing rewards within the SHIB Metaverse.The development and integration of TREAT are anticipated to bring substantial benefits to the Metaverse, fostering engagement and incentivizing participation. As the Shiba Inu Metaverse continues to evolve, these technological advancements and strategic developments underscore Shiba Inu’s commitment to creating a secure, rewarding and inclusive virtual environment for its community.The incorporation of FHE technology, developed by Zama, into the SHIB Metaverse could also set a precedent for other virtual worlds and ecosystems to follow. As privacy concerns continue to grow in the digital age, the project’s proactive approach to data security and user privacy could position it as a leader in the space. The Shiba Inu community, known for its enthusiastic and supportive nature, is likely to welcome these advancements with open arms.

99Bitcoins New Crypto ICO Passes $2 Million Mark, Audit


This article was paid for*99Bitcoins ($99BTC) – a new BRC-20 token – is hitting key milestones during its ongoing presale, catching the attention of deep-pocketed investors.
The new crypto ICO has now raised over $2 million in a span of just a few weeks, a sign of its high upside potential. 
Furthermore, the 99BTC smart contract has passed the SolidProof audit, boosting its already impressive fundamentals.
99Bitcoins’ strong presale performance has drawn praise from experts and crypto influencers, with some even hinting at the possibility of 10x returns after its launch. 

VIDEO

99Bitcoins New Crypto ICO Raises $2 Million
BRC-20 tokens are seeing significant demand in this bull market, owing to their strong correlation with Bitcoin. With experts’ Bitcoin price target for 2024 ranging from $100k to $250k, these tokens could also deliver outsized returns. 
99Bitcoins’ entry in the BRC-20 race was met with significant hype and excitement, even from experts such as Michael Wrubel – who has over 300k subscribers on YouTube. 

VIDEO

99Bitcoins is one of the top crypto and Bitcoin education platforms available, founded in 2013, even before the Ethereum blockchain. The platform has over 2.8 million subscribers while its YouTube channel has another 700k. 
The new 99BTC token is designed to be at the core of 99Bitcoins’ transition from just a crypto education platform to a learn-to-earn ecosystem. 
Essentially, the new cryptocurrency offers considerable financial incentives to the platform’s nearly 3 million subscribers, provided start holding the token. This includes alpha trading signals and strategies, access to VIP groups and lucrative staking rewards. Users can simply progress through 99Bitcoins’ learning material and receive free crypto in their wallets.

This learn-to-earn utility is the key factor driving 99BTC’s demand amongst smart-money traders. If even half of the platform’s subscribers decide to buy and hold the token, it could see significant growth after its launch. 
99BTC Token Passes SolidProof Audit
99BTC has also successfully completed its smart contract audit, publishing the audit report on its presale website. 
The report reveals no security risks in the contract that could put investors’ funds at peril. Furthermore, it is prone to common centralization risks. 
For instance, the contract is non-upgradable and therefore cannot be tampered with, especially since its ownership has also been renounced. This means that the owner cannot mint new tokens, blacklist addresses or pause the contract. 
The 99Bitcoins’ SolidProof audit alleviates some of the concerns associated with new cryptocurrencies while improving its fundamentals. However, experts weren’t overly concerned with the project’s legitimacy to begin with. 
Firstly, as previously mentioned, 99Bitcoins is not a new name in the crypto industry. More importantly, the token is not being run by an anonymous developer team. Instead, the 99Bitcoins founder and chairman Daniel Morgan is a well-known Web3 thought leader and evangelist. 
Morgan’s popular article on Bitcoin Obituaries – a satire on several times the mainstream media claimed BTC is going to zero – gained worldwide recognition. 
Furthermore, the 99BTC token has adopted community-centric tokenomics, with no portion of the supply reserved for the developer team. Investors can check out the exact token supply allocation on the presale website. 
99Bitcoins Airdrop Registration Deadline Approaches
99Bitcoins has announced an airdrop for community members, offering $99,999 in Bitcoin to 99 lucky winners. 
With over $1000 up for grabs for each winner, it is no wonder that the campaign already has close to 12,000 entries. However, late entrants will have just as much of a chance to secure the bounty as those registering early. 
Interested participants can head to the 99Bitcoins presale website and use the Gleam widget to complete a few simple requirements. The winners will be decided on July 19th. 
Considering that the Bitcoin price is on the verge of a major breakout, the airdrop winnings could end up turning into a small fortune for the lucky winners.

New Report from BNY Mellon, the Oldest Bank of the USA: "Institutional Interest in Cryptocurrencies is Increasing!" - Bitcoin Sistemi

A new report came from Bank of New York Mellon (BNY Mellon), one of the Wall Street giants, where interest in Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies continues to increase day by day.
BNY Mellon revealed in a recent report that family offices are increasingly adding cryptocurrencies to their portfolios.


Stating that family offices are investigating new investment opportunities and turning to them, BNY Mellon said that crypto currencies constitute 5% of the portfolios of family offices.
According to the 2024 BNY Mellon Wealth Management Survey , approximately 39% of family offices surveyed are either actively investing in or considering cryptocurrencies.





Stating that this rate underlines the intense interest in cryptocurrencies, which are the modern asset class, BNY Mellon said that some family offices remain hesitant about investing in BTC and cryptocurrencies.
While 38% of survey respondents expressed disinterest in cryptocurrencies, citing concerns about the high volatility of digital assets and the uncertain regulatory environment, they also stated that their hesitations included concerns about hacking and cybercrime in cryptocurrencies.



“In keeping with their entrepreneurial nature, family offices demonstrate that they are ready and willing to move forward into new and emerging opportunities.
“Cryptocurrencies make up 5% of portfolios, an allocation that would have been unthinkable a decade ago.”

Among those researching or investing in cryptocurrencies, spot cryptocurrency ETFs are clearly preferred, while some have expressed a preference for trading directly on exchanges.
What are Family Offices?
The concept of Family Office arose from the need for family members to diversify their assets and manage them in a performance-oriented manner while continuing their main pursuits.





Family offices are privately owned organizations established by wealthy families to manage their wealth, plan their family's financial future, take advantage of investment opportunities, and provide other services to family members.

South Korea classifies select NFTs as cryptocurrencies


South Korea’s Financial Services Commission (FSC) has unveiled new regulations that classify specific non-fungible tokens (NFTs) as virtual assets, akin to cryptocurrencies. 



Announced Monday, the guidelines stipulate that NFTs that are mass-produced, divisible, and can be utilized for payments will be subject to this new categorization. 



This regulatory move is aimed at providing clarity within the evolving digital asset sector and ensuring that certain NFTs are governed by the same rules as traditional cryptocurrencies.



The FSC’s guidelines are a response to the increasing use of NFTs in ways that mirror cryptocurrencies, targeting those that are interchangeable and lack unique characteristics. 



The FSC said it will review NFT collections on a case-by-case basis to determine their classification, indicating a tailored approach to regulation rather than a blanket policy. 



This decision reflects South Korea’s recognition of the diverse functionalities of digital tokens, potentially leading to more regulated and stable NFT markets, and offering clearer direction for both creators and investors.



The announcement precedes the implementation of South Korea’s comprehensive crypto regulation, the Virtual Asset User Protection Act, scheduled for July 19, 2024. 



This act is designed to curb illegal activities in the crypto space and requires crypto service providers to protect user deposits, primarily through cold storage, and to participate in insurance schemes for user compensation in the event of security breaches.

What's Going On With Bitcoin-Miner Marathon Digital's Stock? - Marathon Digital Holdings (NASDAQ:MARA) - Benzinga

Marathon Digital Holdings, Inc. MARA shares are moving Monday.  The company announced a decrease in Bitcoin BTC/USD production for May and Kerrisdale Capital issued a short report on Riot Platforms, Inc. RIOT last week.  What To Know:Marathon Digital announced on Wednesday that it produced 616 bitcoins in May, down from 850 in April and a 50% decrease from 1,245 bitcoins in May 2023. The company also said it had increased its holdings to 17,857 bitcoins. Marathon said it energized approximately 5,000 additional miners (c. 0.7 EH/s). Approximately 9,000 miners were reinstalled at the Ellendale facility, awaiting a return to full energization. As a result, Marathon’s operating fleet increased to approximately 246,000 bitcoin miners theoretically capable of producing 30.6 EH/s, with 237,000 miners (c. 29.3 EH/s) fully operational. In May, Marathon achieved a peak overall hash rate of 28.1 EH/s. “In May, we mitigated the impact of the April Halving event by increasing the number of blocks won, resulting in the production of 616 bitcoin, a decline of only 27%,” said Marathon CEO Fred Thiel. Kerrisdale Capital issued a short-seller report on peer bitcoin-miner Riot Platforms last Thursday which alleged that the crypto-mining industry is one of the worst business models for a public company due to unpredictable revenue, high capital requirements and fierce competition. The short report may have contributed to Marathon shares dipping to close down more than 7% Friday. Related News: Wedbush’s Dan Ives Says WWDC 2024 Is ‘Most Important Event For Apple In Over A Decade’: What To ExpectIs MARA A Good Stock To Buy?An investor can make a few decisions when deciding whether a stock is a good buy. In addition to valuation metrics and price action which you can find on Benzinga's quote pages  – like Marathon Digital Holdings‘ page for example – there are factors like whether or not a company pays a dividend or buys a large portion of its stock each quarter.These are known as capital allocation programs. Marathon Digital Holdings does not pay a dividend, but obviously has a few ways it can return value to shareholders. Feel free to search Benzinga's dividend calendar for the next company that is due to pay a dividend and determine what kind of yield you can earn for holding a share of the company.For example, if you're looking to earn an annualized return of 13.14%, you'll need to buy a share of Annaly Capital Management by June 28, 2024. Once done, you can expect to receive a nominal payout of $0.65 on July 31, 2024.Buyback programs are obviously different and highly variable. A company can approve a buyback program and purchase shares as it sees fit over the course of time in which the buyback was authorized. Looking through the latest news on Marathon Digital Holdings will often yield whether or not the company has approved a buyback program recently. Buyback programs usually serve as a support for share prices, serving as a backstop for demand.MARA Price Action: According to Benzinga Pro, Marathon Digital shares are up 0.52% at $19.35 at the time of publication Monday.Image: Pete Linforth from Pixabay

Bitcoin ETF snapshot: $2B of inflows, but BTC price stuck - Blockworks


Bitcoin marched closer to an all-time high price last week amid particularly strong inflows into bitcoin ETFs.
But uncertainty around the Federal Reserve’s potential interest rate cut outlook appears to be keeping BTC from hitting a new peak.
The US spot bitcoin ETF category notched $887 million of net inflows on June 4, according to Farside Investors data — the second-highest total for the segment in a single day since they launched in January.

In total, the 11 funds reeled in roughly $1.8 billion in assets from June 3 to June 7, the data shows. BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust — now the largest bitcoin ETF — accounted for $948 million of those inflows, while the Fidelity Wise Origin Bitcoin Fund (FBTC) welcomed $679 million.
Net inflows for the category now total nearly $15.7 billion after about five months on the market.
Trading volumes across crypto exchange-traded products reached $12.8 billion last week, according to CoinShares — up 55% from the week before. Inflows were seen far and wide across providers, CoinShares research head James Butterfill wrote in a Monday report. 
Slight outflows of $31 million for the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust ETF (GBTC) reflect a continued slowdown of asset hemorrhaging for the fund.
“We believe this turn-around in sentiment is a direct response to weaker than expected macro data in the US, bringing forward monetary policy rate cut expectations,” Butterfill added.
BTC’s price hit nearly $72,000 on Friday before retreating further from its high of more than $73,000. One bitcoin was trading at roughly $69,300 at 10 am ET Monday — down 0.4% on the day but up 2.4% from a week ago.  
The sell-off came after US employment data dropped Friday. The US economy added 272,000 jobs in May — a higher figure than analysts expected.
Other macro factors are also in the mix. The European Central Bank went ahead with its first rate cut in five years — from 4% to 3.75%.
“But even the most bullish of traders appreciates the Fed will surely need to follow suit for bitcoin to take the next step,” Stocklytics analyst Neil Roarty said in a statement. 
The Federal Reserve’s FOMC meeting comes Wednesday. Pepperstone research strategist Michael Brown said he doesn’t expect the May employment report to be a “game-changer” for the Fed’s policy outlook.

Galaxy Digital CEO Mike Novogratz and others have said they believe bitcoin could hit $100,000 by the end of the year — citing the ETF interest and possible US interest rate cuts.

Dogecoin (DOGE) Supporter Elon Musk Mentioned a Different Memecoin for the First Time! - Bitcoin Sistemi


Tesla CEO Elon Musk, known for his support of Dogecoin, talked about the popular Solana (SOL)-based memecoin Dogwifhat (WIF) during a live broadcast.
Accordingly, while Musk was seen stating that he “knew Dogwifhat” in the video, this led to speculation and excitement among WIF's millions of followers.


Because WIF investors were excited, considering Elon Musk's support for Dogecoin (DOGE) in the past.
Elon Musk has also not mentioned any small memecoins before and focused on Dogecoin.





While this was the first time Musk mentioned a memecoin other than Dogecoin, Tesla CEO announced that he preferred DOGE over Shiba Inu (SHIB), the second largest memecoin.
For this reason, while his words about WIF were met with surprise, the price did not pump as in the DOGE posts. WIF investors did not engage in FOMO.


Although WIF rose slightly following Musk's remarks, the WIF price is trading at $2.68, down a small 0.4% over the past 24 hours.

Bitcoin ETFs see third-largest daily inflow amidst rate cut anticipation - Crypto Briefing


            
            
                            
            
                            
            
            Crypto investment products saw a massive inflow of $2 billion so far in June, fuelled by the expectation around rate cuts in the US. According to asset management firm CoinShares, these products saw a cumulative $4.3 billion inflow for the past five weeks. Bitcoin continued to be the primary focus of investors, with inflows of $1.97 billion for the week. Conversely, short Bitcoin products experienced outflows for the third consecutive week, totaling $5.3 million.Ethereum also saw a notable uptick in interest, with its best week of inflows since March, totaling $69 million. This is likely a response to the unexpected SEC decision to permit spot-based ETFs. Meanwhile, the rest of the altcoins experienced less activity, though Fantom and XRP stood out with inflows of $1.4 million and $1.2 million, respectively.CaptionRegionally, the US registered the majority of inflows observed, amounting to $1.98 billion in the last week alone, with the first day of the week witnessing the third-largest daily inflow on record. The iShares Bitcoin ETF has now overtaken the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust, boasting $21 billion in assets under management. Hong Kong came second, surpassing $26 million last week and also amounting to the second-largest year-to-date inflow volume of $326 million.Trading volumes for crypto exchange-traded products (ETPs) surged to $12.8 billion for the week, marking a 55% increase from the previous week. In a notable shift, inflows were recorded across nearly all providers, while the usual outflows from established firms slowed down. CoinShares’ analysts attribute this change in market sentiment to weaker-than-expected US macroeconomic data, which has led to anticipations of monetary policy rate cuts. The positive market movement pushed the total assets under management above the $100 billion threshold for the first time since March of this year.

Ripple CTO Responds To Rumors That The Crypto Firm Is Abandoning XRP | Bitcoinist.com


								The Ripple Chief Technology Officer (CTO) David Schwartz has responded to rumours that the Company might be considering abandoning its association with the XRP token. The crypto firm has so far provided XRP with its major utilities, and such rumors could negatively impact its price.
Ripple Is Not Abandoning XRP
Schwartz clarified in an X (formerly Twitter) post that Ripple wasn’t abandoning XRP and that the post that kicked off the rumors was misunderstood. The rumors began when an X user (@AspenSignals) posted Schwartz’s cover photo on his X platform and asked if Ripple was abandoning XRP. 

Schwartz’s cover photo suggested that the company was abandoning XRP due to a “web of corruption” in the financial world, which was set to hinder them from achieving their goal of providing instant payment services using XRP. 
Source: X
However, Schwartz stated that the lines related to a fictional pitch for a fictional movie. He added that the circumstances to make the pitch match reality haven’t happened yet, suggesting that Ripple wasn’t facing such a challenge. However, Ripple facing such a challenge seemed feasible considering its long-running legal battle against the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).
At some point, the Commission was believed to have maliciously enforced an action against the crypto firm based on claims made by Ethereum insider Steven Nerayoff. Moreover, the lawsuit has had a negative impact on Ripple’s operations and could have easily forced them to abandon XRP due to regulatory scrutiny. 
Thankfully, Schwartz’s swift response has helped clear things up and helped alleviate concerns among XRP community members. XRP is at the centre of Ripple’s operations, and the crypto firm uses it to provide cross-border payment services. Ripple is also the largest XRP holder, holding almost 50% of the crypto token’s supply. That is another reason why XRP community members may have been concerned, considering that the crypto firm might dump its XRP holdings on the market if it abandons XRP. 
Still Part Of Long-Term Plans
In an interview with CNBC, Ripple’s President Monica Long reaffirmed that XRP was still part of the company’s long-term plans. She made this remark when she was quizzed on whether or not there was still a need for the XRP token, with Ripple making plans to launch its stablecoin. Long clarified that XRP will still be used in its operations, noting that the crypto firm uses a “mix of assets” to serve its payment customers. 

She also highlighted that XRP serves a unique purpose and is a bridge asset for the “long tail of currency pairs.” She also alluded to XRP’s future use case, noting that it will play a major role as Ripple tokenizes more assets on-chain. Long stated that XRP will be used to provide liquidity to these assets.

At time of writing, PEPE is trading at $0.0000125, down 13% in the last week.

Cardano's 'Age of Voltaire' nears with major blockchain upgrade

Cardano founder Charles Hoskinson revealed that the blockchain is on course for its “most significant milestone in history,” with the impending Chang fork setting the stage for the “Age of Voltaire.”In a June 9 social media post, Hoskinson said:“It looks like June will be the month that Cardano Node will reach 9.0. This means that Cardano is Chang fork ready and waiting for 70 percent of the SPOs to install the new node. Then, a hard fork can occur pushing Cardano into the Age of Voltaire.”Age of VoltaireThe Chang upgrade will mark a pivotal moment for Cardano as it introduces crucial tools and infrastructure to support the “Age of Voltaire.”The Voltaire era is set to provide the final elements needed for the network to achieve self-sustainability. It empowers network participants to propose Cardano improvements, subject to stakeholder voting that leverages the existing staking and delegation process.Voltaire also establishes a treasury system to finance future network development. A portion of all transaction fees will be pooled to fund development efforts decided upon through the voting process.Once these voting and treasury systems are operational, Cardano will be fully decentralized and no longer be under IOHK’s management. The community will take the reins and be equipped to nurture and advance Cardano from its secure, decentralized foundation.Hoskinson, commenting on the update, said:“It’s the most significant milestone in the history of Cardano and for the industry as a whole. Cardano will be a decentralized civilization spanning the entire world with millions of residents. We’ll have the most advanced blockchain governance system, annual budgets, a treasury, and the wisdom of our entire community to guide us.”How will ADA react?While Hoskinson is focused on the technological strides made by the upgrade, most Cardano holders are more concerned about how it impacts ADA’s price.This year, ADA has emerged as one of the struggling large-cap digital assets, briefly falling out of the top 10 digital assets by market capitalization at different points during the past month.While many traders perceive its current price of $0.4376 as undervalued, the price performance of its rivals, such as Solana and Ethereum, has increased anxiety surrounding the project.However, Hoskinson believes that Cardano’s fundamentals remain robust, which would translate into a positive growth trajectory for the digital asset.Mentioned in this articleLatest Alpha Market Report

XRP to the Moon? Crypto Analyst Bullish on XRP Price with $7.5 Target


							

XRP Atlas line targets $1.5, with high conviction to break the White Triangle pattern.



Critical Fib 1.618 zone ($6.5-$7.5) identified for profit-taking.



A weekly close above Fib 1.618 could lead to mid-double-digit targets near Fib 2.414 & 2.618.




XRP’s price could be headed for a significant upswing based on two key technical indicators and current market trends. As per the analysis shared by Egrag Crypto, the Atlas Line for XRP is raised to $7.5 with $1.5 as the initial target. Expressing a high conviction of breaking the White Triangle pattern, Egrag Crypto is confident XRP will surpass this initial resistance level. 







Next, the analysis highlights a key price zone between $6.5 and $7.5, known as the Fib 1.618, where profit-taking is expected to occur. Traders and investors are therefore advised to keep a close eye on this zone for potential price movements and adjust their positions accordingly. If XRP manages to overcome the Fib 1.618 level in a week, the analyst predicts the next targets to be in the mid-double digits, near the Fib 2.414 and 2.618 levels. This suggests further upside potential in XRP’s price action, as long as the current bullish momentum is maintained.







Doubling down on the forecast, the crypto analyst also urged the XRP Army to remain steadfast since the rotational profits from other altcoins are expected to pour into XRP once it starts to pump. Referring to the Ripple-affiliated token as the “black horse,” the analyst emphasized the optimistic outlook for XRP’s future performance in the market.









This update highlights key levels to watch and potential price targets based on technical tools. However, it’s essential to conduct thorough research before making any trading decisions.

FLOKI Memecoin to Enter India with Education Project


                                FLOKI to Enter India with an Educational Project                                FLOKI, a globally popular memecoin, is planning to build a school in India as part of its charitable initiative. This step is part of FLOKI's mission to promote education in developing countries. After successful projects in Nigeria, Laos, Guatemala, and Ghana, FLOKI is now focusing on India. India, with its rapidly growing economy and being the world's most populous country, holds significant cultural and educational importance. However, many parts of the country still struggle with access to quality education. Recognizing these challenges, Memecoin FLOKI aims to improve the education sector in India by establishing schools.According to FLOKI's team, they are ready to partner with interested NGOs in India to expedite this mission. FLOKI has announced that organizations willing to collaborate on this initiative can contact their team. FLOKI believes that through this partnership, millions of school children will have better educational opportunities. The initiative aims to provide education to school children and guide them towards a brighter future. FLOKI is committed to bringing about significant change in the education sector in India through this initiative. These schools will not only aim to revolutionize education but also play a crucial role in the overall development of children. Through its initiatives in India, FLOKI is advancing the Global Education Mission. If successful, FLOKI plans to implement similar initiatives in other parts of India.FLOKI’s Goal with Charitable Initiatives in IndiaSuch initiatives are expected to increase the popularity of Memecoin Project FLOKI in India. As everyone knows, over 20% of India’s young population invests in the cryptocurrency market. A report states that 25% of Indian cryptocurrency investors hold Shiba Inu. With this initiative, FLOKI aims to challenge SHIB’s popularity in India. This move could attract a large number of investors from India to FLOKI in the future. Additionally, FLOKI may gain popularity among non-crypto users. Through this charitable initiative, FLOKI could also earn the trust of the Indian government, making FLOKI the first choice when the government considers supporting or giving concessions to any cryptocurrency in its future regulatory framework.Also Read:- Trump VS Biden And The Future Of Domestic Bitcoin Mining

Uniswap Labs Acquires 'Crypto: The Game' Ahead of Next Season - Decrypt

Crypto: The Game, the "Survivor"-inspired reality competition that went viral earlier this year, is coming back for a third season—under new ownership.On Monday, Uniswap Labs—the startup behind the leading Ethereum decentralized exchange, Uniswap—announced that it has acquired Crypto: The Game. Founders Dylan Abruscato, Tyler Cagle, and Bryan Lee will join Uniswap Labs to continue steering the direction of the experience, along with helping Uniswap Labs craft its own messaging around decentralized finance. Crypto: The Game is an on-chain survival game that quickly gained buzz on Crypto Twitter amid its first season, during which players competed in a series of challenges—such as playing Pac-Man online or real-world scavenger hunts—for $115,000 worth of ETH.As in "Survivor," players were split into tribes, and winning or losing challenges determined whether or not a tribe would have to vote members off. The last person standing wins. Both seasons of Crypto: The Game have captured significant attention—and generated a lot of drama, too. The first season was won by a pseudonymous player from a rural town in Japan, who wrote poems for his fellow teammates and won by being an all-around good person. The next season unfolded much differentlySeason 2 saw some 800 players spend over 4,000 hours combined on the game’s website and tackling its challenges—and concluded with a group of players teaming up to buy back into the game after a brutal backstabbing eliminated them from the competition. They collectively won the $210,000 prize and donated all the proceeds to the Tornado Cash Legal Defense Fund. Several members of Uniswap Labs participated in the first season, and then the firm got onboard with season two by sponsoring one of the challenges—a “custom crypto scavenger hunt,” as Abruscato described it to Decrypt.“I think that made them realize that we kind of cracked the code for bringing folks on-chain,” he added.When asked about his team’s decision to join Uniswap Labs instead of staying independent, Abruscato told Decrypt that he wants to continue to scale Crypto: The Game. He believes that Uniswap Labs builds amazing products, and hopes to tap into that expertise to take the game to new heights. What can future Crypto: The Game players look forward to? While a date hasn’t been set for the upcoming season, Abruscato affirmed that all of the elements of the game that the community has grown to know and love will continue to be there.“We see this as an opportunity to leverage their expertise and our learnings from previous seasons,” Abruscato explained. “There will still be new games, new twists, and new drama—just all under the Uniswap Labs umbrella.”Edited by Andrew HaywardGG NewsletterGet the latest web3 gaming news, hear directly from gaming studios and influencers covering the space, and receive power-ups from our partners.

Moreover, the daily PEPE/USD chart revealed that the recent pullback has found support along an ascending trendline. So, the uptrend may soon resume. 
The Stochastic RSI was oversold at press time — potentially signaling a price reversal. Also, the MACD histogram has crossed above the signal line, indicating a potential bullish crossover.
Is it worth diving into the dip?
PEPE’s current dip presents a potential buying opportunity. The surge in active addresses and transaction volumes provided a major bullish signal.

The strong support found along the ascending trendline and oversold conditions on the Stochastic RSI affirmed the bullish signal. It suggested that more investors were considering buying the dip.

Neither the author, Tim Fries, nor this website, The Tokenist, provide financial advice. Please consult our website policy prior to making financial decisions.



Monday morning trading today has been marked by significant moves in several stocks, driven by a combination of company-specific developments and broader market trends. Here are the top three you should be watching.



Private equity giant KKR & Co. Inc. (NYSE: KKR) is set to join the S&P 500 index, sending its shares soaring. General Motors (NYSE: GM) is partnering with Costco’s (NASDAQ: COST) Auto Program to boost electric vehicle (EV) sales, tapping into the retailer’s vast membership base. Meanwhile, activist hedge fund Elliott Management has taken a substantial stake in Southwest Airlines (LUV), pushing for leadership changes to turn around the struggling carrier.



KKR Set to Join S&P 500, Stock Soars



KKR’s impending inclusion in the S&P 500 index has prompted a surge in its stock price, with shares up 10% to an all-time intraday high of $108.



The move is expected to drive demand from index-tracking funds, further bolstering the stock’s performance. KKR has outperformed the S&P 500 over the past 1-year (+97.59%), 3-year (+101.49%), and 5-year (+379.62%) periods, showcasing the company’s strong growth trajectory.

GM Partners with Costco to Boost EV Sales



General Motors is leveraging Costco’s Auto Program to expand its reach in the EV market. The partnership enables Costco’s 50 million-plus US members to purchase GM’s electric vehicles at discounted prices. With a growing interest in EVs among Costco members, GM sees this collaboration as a significant opportunity to increase sales.



The automaker is gearing up to release a range of affordable EV models, including the Chevrolet Equinox EV and an updated Chevrolet Bolt. Costco members will enjoy $1,000 off select EV models from GM’s Cadillac and Chevrolet brands this summer. GM stock is trading at $47.48, up $1.75 or 3.85%, with a market cap of $53.969 billion at the time of writing.



Elliott Management Takes Stake in Southwest Airlines, Pushes for Change

Sifu’s UwU Lend reportedly hacked for $20M, Curve’s Egorov among affected


UwU Lend, created by notorious fraudster Michael Patryn (a.k.a. 0xSifu) has been hacked for almost $20 million, according to an alert by blockchain security firm Cyvers.
An initial post on X (formerly Twitter) drew attention to $14 million worth of losses before Cyvers identified further losses, totaling $19.5 million worth of crypto assets.
The attack transactions show the use of ‘flash loans’ which can be used to manipulate asset prices on decentralized finance (DeFi) apps. Audit firm Peckshield noted that, in this case, five stablecoin pairs were targeted in order to influence the sUSDe price feed, or ‘oracle.’
UwU Lend is a ‘fork’ of DeFi’s premier lending protocol Aave, specifically its v2 codebase. In November, Aave alerted the community to a bug found in the v2 code which was later remediated by disabling stable borrow rates.
The protocol was paused shortly after the attack, according to the official UwU Lend X account.

Stolen funds include USDC, FRAX, crvUSD and blUSD. These were converted to ETH before being consolidated in a new address which currently holds over 4000 ETH ($15 million). The hacker was funded two days ago via the sanctioned crypto mixing service Tornado Cash.
Among the users affected by the hack was Curve Finance founder Michael Egorov. UwU Lend is one of several platforms he uses to borrow stablecoins against his own CRV holdings. The price of CRV has dropped around 5% since the hack, according to data from CoinMarketCap.

Patryn was revealed to be behind the pseudonym 0xSifu by on-chain detective ZachXBT in February of 2022. Previously, he had co-founded the Canadian crypto exchange QuadrigaCX, which lost nine figures of user funds in 2019.
Since then, Patryn had worked alongside Daniele Sestagalli, building a DeFi empire known as ‘Frog Nation.’ The projects included Magic Internet Money, Wonderland, and Abracadabra, which was itself hacked for $6.5 million earlier this year.
Over the past week, Ethereum L2 Loopring reported a compromise of its ‘smart wallet’ 2FA system, landing a hacker $5 million worth of ETH, and crypto exchange Lykke was reportedly hacked for $19.5 million of BTC and ETH.

Bitfarms plays defense as rival Riot still eyes takeover - Blockworks


Bitfarms is looking to ward off an attempt by Riot Platforms to take control of the company — at least in the near-term. 
The bitcoin miner rejected Riot’s unsolicited April bid to buy the company, noting in a statement last month that the deal “significantly undervalues” Bitfarms. 
Bitfarms said its board of directors was in the midst of a “strategic alternatives review process,” which includes evaluating options such as continuing to execute its business plan or selling the company.
Riot has declined to participate in Bitfarms’ review process in an attempt to “undermine” it and “thwart the interest of third parties,” Bitfarms claims.
A Riot spokesperson did not immediately return Blockworks’ request for comment.

Now, Bitfarms has put in place a shareholder rights plan to “preserve the integrity” of the board of directors’ process, it said in a Monday news release.
It would allow the company to attach a so-called right to each common share issued after June 20. Those rights become exercisable if an owner holds 15% or more of Bitfarms’ outstanding shares between June 20 and Sept. 10.
In essence, shareholder rights plans often seek to issue more shares as a way to limit the control of a shareholder seeking to take over the company.
Riot Platforms owned roughly 3.6% of Bitfarms stock upon making an offer to buy all of Bitfarms’ remaining shares on April 22. Riot now holds about 11.6% of the company’s stock and said it intended to requisition a special shareholders meeting to nominate what it calls “well-qualified and independent directors.”
Riot plans to “review its investment in the company on a continuing basis,” the company said in a June 5 statement.
If shareholders don’t ratify the plan within six months, the plan will be terminated.
The plan was approved “to ensure, to the extent possible, that the board has sufficient opportunity to identify, develop and negotiate alternatives,” the Monday news release states.   
The miner has pointed out its planned 223% hash rate increase and 40% efficiency improvement in 2024, saying that moving forward toward those projections maximizes shareholder value.
A Bitfarms spokesperson did not immediately comment further.  
Peter Stoneberg, managing director at crypto advisory firm Architect Partners, previously told Blockworks that Bitfarms was “doing everything right to put up a strong defense to Riot’s bid.”
The company, for example, last month named Moelis & Company as its financial adviser, as well as Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom to help it with legal matters.

Fintech Company Robinhood Expands Cryptocurrency Activities After Acquiring Bitstamp! - Bitcoin Sistemi

Robinhood's recent acquisition of crypto exchange Bitstamp marks a significant expansion in its global footprint, according to a report by investment bank Architect Partners.
Robinhood's Acquisition of Bitstamp Expands Global Reach
This strategic move underscores the growing importance of cryptocurrency in Robinhood's business model, accounting for 20% of the company's total revenue in the first quarter of 2024.


Despite facing regulatory scrutiny from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), Robinhood continues to strengthen its digital asset business.
Last month, the company received a Wells Notice from the SEC, a preliminary warning that the regulator could take enforcement action regarding Robinhood's listing of certain crypto tokens that are viewed as potentially unlicensed securities.





Architect Partners emphasized that the acquisition of Bitstamp would significantly increase Robinhood's ability to operate globally and mitigate the potential impact of regulatory actions in the United States.
This acquisition immediately expands global reach to enable participation regardless of U.S. actions, the report said.


The acquisition is also expected to strengthen Robinhood's institutional offerings and position the company as a major player in the emerging digital asset space.
With its ability to serve institutions, Robinhood is emerging as one of the few publicly traded companies with a strong influence on the cryptocurrency market.






Known for its long operational history and extensive global licensing, Bitstamp was acquired by Robinhood for $200 million in cash.
This price represents a significant discount from the $500 million valuation Bitstamp received during its majority investment in 2018.
Architect Partners described Bitstamp as a “significant asset” for Robinhood, citing Bitstamp's established reputation and global reach.

Robinhood's expansion through this acquisition underscores the company's commitment to growing its presence in the cryptocurrency industry despite regulatory challenges.
This move is seen as a strategic step to enhance service offerings and maintain a competitive advantage in the global digital asset market.

Microsoft’s AI Outsourcing to OpenAI Could Benefit Google, Says Okta CEO | Cryptoglobe


                                
Microsoft has recently delegated the development of its premier artificial intelligence tools and software to OpenAI, a decision that could potentially benefit its competitor, Google, according to Todd McKinnon, CEO of Okta, a top provider of cloud-based software solutions for businesses to manage and secure who has access to their digital resources.



Per a report by Ryan Browne for CNBC, as Google seeks to maintain its supremacy in search, it continues to control its research and development efforts, unlike Microsoft, which is outsourcing these crucial components to OpenAI.



The report says that Google’s foundational work on transformers, the deep-learning models crucial for generative AI technologies, underscores its strong position. McKinnon claims that these models, which understand context and meaning by analyzing sequential data, were developed by Google and its DeepMind research team and that this technology forms the backbone of many large language models (LLMs) driving recent AI advancements.



McKinnon expressed concerns that Microsoft’s strategic move might reduce its role in AI development to that of a consultancy, given that many of its top products now incorporate technology from OpenAI. Microsoft has invested heavily in OpenAI, with its total investment reportedly reaching $13 billion. This investment is intended to accelerate AI breakthroughs and ensure that the benefits are widely shared.







            
            

            
            

            
            

        

The partnership has led to significant integrations of OpenAI’s technology into Microsoft’s products, such as the Copilot generative AI chatbot and PCs equipped with generative AI software. This heavy reliance on OpenAI has raised questions about Microsoft’s strategic positioning in the AI market.



The CNBC report also mentions that Google faces its own set of challenges. Google has encountered several public issues with its AI products. For example, its AI chatbot Gemini, initially called Bard, provided incorrect answers in a promotional ad, and the Gemini image generator produced inaccurate historical images, leading Google to temporarily suspend the tool.



The immense investments by major tech firms in AI have also raised concerns about competition and cybersecurity. McKinnon warned that challenges such as disinformation could impede technological progress and predicted that stringent regulations might result in only the most powerful companies retaining control over AI. While the potential for artificial intelligence is substantial, he cautioned that excessive regulation could limit the industry to a few dominant players.

Binance Breaks 200 Million User Barrier: Can They Weather the Storm?


								The past two years for Binance, the world’s largest cryptocurrency exchange, have been a whirlwind. Regulatory battles, hefty fines, and even the arrest of its founder CZ, the exchange painted a picture of an industry titan under siege.
Yet, Binance has emerged unscathed. On Saturday, the exchange announced it had surpassed a staggering 200 million users, solidifying its position as the undisputed king of crypto.
Richard Teng, CEO of Binance, attended the company’s celebration and sent the users his best wishes. He admitted that the community’s support was a major factor in the journey’s success. His message said:

We have hit 200M users Binance! This milestone wouldn’t have been possible without YOU – our incredible community … Thank you! The journey to 1 billion users continues. Let’s keep building together.


Unfazed By The Storm
This milestone comes amidst a backdrop of intense scrutiny. Since 2022, the company has faced a barrage of regulatory hurdles from countries like the UK, Singapore, and the US.
Accusations of lax anti-money laundering measures and unregistered securities offerings resulted in hefty fines and limitations on operations. In a particularly dramatic turn, news broke of CZ’s arrest in China in early 2024, raising fears for the exchange’s future.


However, the crypto exchange seems to have weathered the storm remarkably well. Not only did it maintain its user base, but it also managed to grow it significantly.
Compared to 130 million users reported in 2023, Binance has added a staggering 70 million in just two years. This resilience suggests a deep well of user loyalty, perhaps due to its wide range of crypto offerings, competitive fees, and user-friendly platform.
BTC is currently trading at $69,390. Chart: TradingView
Growing Concerns
While Binance’s growth is undeniably impressive, it also raises concerns about the increasing centralization of the cryptocurrency market. With a user base representing a whopping 35% of the global crypto community (estimated at 562 million in 2024),

The company wields immense power. A potential future scenario where Binance experiences a security breach or faces stricter regulations could have a devastating ripple effect on the entire crypto market.
Unanswered Questions
The announcement of this milestone credits the growth to a perfect alignment between Binance’s products and market demand. However, it does not specify what drives this demand.
Are users attracted by Binance’s extensive coin selection, the convenience of its mobile app, or are they simply unaware of the controversies surrounding the exchange?

The Solana Foundation removes the validators due to sandwich attacks

The Solana Foundation has recently taken decisive action by removing a group of validator operators from its delegation program due to their involvement in sandwich attacks against users. This move, aimed at safeguarding the integrity and security of the network, underscores the foundation’s commitment to maintaining a fair and secure ecosystem for all participants.

What is a sandwich attack? Why is it dangerous for Solana Foundation?
To fully understand the gravity of the situation, it is essential to understand what sandwich attacks are. Sandwich attacks are a form of market manipulation in cryptocurrencies and decentralized exchanges (DEX). In a sandwich attack, a malicious actor observes a pending transaction on the blockchain and inserts two transactions: one before and one after the observed one. The goal is to exploit the price fluctuations caused by the original transaction to make a profit. In other words, the malicious actor “inserts” their transactions “around” the target transaction, hence the term “sandwich”.
The Solana Foundation has discovered that some validators in its delegation program were actively participating in these sandwich attacks. This behavior not only undermines users’ trust in the network, but also goes against the rules and principles established by the foundation itself.
The foundation acted quickly to remove these validators, emphasizing that such harmful practices will not be tolerated. This decision was made in line with the policies of the Solana Foundation, which prohibit any activity that could damage the integrity of the network or disadvantage users. The removal of these operators not only protects users but also serves as a warning to other validators who might consider similar practices.
The importance of the delegation program
The delegation program of the Solana Foundation is a crucial element of the Solana ecosystem. It allows stakers to delegate their SOL tokens to trusted validators, thus contributing to the security and decentralization of the network. The validators, in turn, earn rewards for their work in validating transactions and maintaining the network.
However, trust is a fundamental component in this system. Stakers must be able to trust that the validators are operating honestly and transparently. The actions of the Solana Foundation demonstrate that the organization is willing to take rigorous measures to maintain this trust, ensuring that only validators who adhere to the rules and ethical principles can participate in the delegation program.
The removal of validators involved in sandwich attacks has several implications for the Solana community. Firstly, it strengthens security and trust in the network. Users can be certain that the foundation will closely monitor the behavior of validators and take action against any malicious activity.
Secondly, this action can encourage other validators to maintain high ethical standards, knowing that their actions will be monitored and that any misconduct will not be tolerated. This can lead to a healthier and more responsible community of validators, further improving the stability and reputation of the Solana network.
Conclusions
The decision by the Solana Foundation to remove validators involved in sandwich attacks from the delegation program is a clear signal of its commitment to the security and integrity of the network. This move protects users from harmful practices and strengthens trust in the Solana ecosystem. In a rapidly evolving sector like that of cryptocurrencies, transparency and decisive action are fundamental to maintaining a safe and reliable environment.
The Solana Foundation has demonstrated its willingness to take the necessary measures to ensure that the network remains a fair place for all participants, sending a strong message to the entire community: manipulation and harmful practices will not be tolerated. With this action, the foundation not only protects its users but also contributes to building a safer and more transparent future for the entire blockchain ecosystem.

SHIB Fans Want ETF: Petition Nears Goal, Grayscale Silent


							

Shiba Inu community nears 10k signatures for an ETF petition, driven by SHIB BPP and influential figures like Heber Mayen.



Despite surpassing initial expectations, Grayscale Investments remains silent on SHIB ETF, leaving enthusiasts eager for a response.



Advocates stress the necessity of a SHIB ETF, citing Google Trends data and potential benefits for SHIB’s stability and adoption.




The Shiba Inu community is closing in on a major milestone: 10,000 signatures for a Shiba Inu ETF petition. Led by figures like Heber Mayen, the campaign has gained significant traction in just 58 days, needing only 300 more signatures to reach its ambitious goal.







Since its inception, the SHIB BPP initiative and other dedicated supporters have relentlessly rallied for signatures, urging fellow community members to participate in the drive. The petition, addressed to Grayscale Investments CEO, Michael Sonnenshein, aims to draw attention to the demand for an ETF specifically tailored for Shiba Inu.



With over 9,700 signatures, the campaign has surpassed its initial target of 1,000 set for February 26. Notably, the past week has seen a spike in support, with 140 new signatories. Despite the community’s efforts, Grayscale Investments has remained mum, leaving enthusiasts anxiously awaiting a response. Grayscale is a major player in the cryptocurrency ETF space, having launched successful Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs.









Grayscale does not currently offer SHIB ETFs, which has led supporters to stress on the importance of having one. Proponents believe a regulated and accessible ETF could boost SHIB’s stability and drive mainstream adoption. They point to Google Trends data as evidence of SHIB’s popularity and demand.



In light of these developments, the Shiba Inu community has remained optimistic about the potential for their efforts to gain recognition and influence. The proximity to the 10,000 signature milestone underscores the strong support for the initiative and the growing investor interest in Shiba Inu.

OKX SIM-swap leads to discovery of 2FA security flaw


A flaw in the two-factor authentication (2FA) security system used by crypto and derivatives exchange OKX has apparently been discovered after two users reported that their accounts had been hacked and their funds drained in a suspected SIM-swapping attack.
The founder of blockchain security firm SlowMist, Yu Xian, reported that the users received SMS risk notifications from Hong Kong before a new API key was created as part of their account authentication process.  
Following up on these reports, security analysts Dilation Effect (DE) claims to have found a flaw in OKX’s authentication system. It said that users are able to switch from 2FA to ‘lower security verification methods,’ like SMS verification, during OKX’s sensitive user operations. 

Such sensitive actions include withdrawals, whitelisting addresses, changing the login password, and disabling 2FA verification. DE says these actions don’t trigger a 24-hour withdrawal ban and that a ban is only triggered when logging into a new device. 
Additionally, if an address is whitelisted, DE claims large amounts of crypto can be withdrawn without the need for additional verification. “This quick analysis reveals that OKX’s security settings lack baseline design. Possibly to enhance user experience, OKX has made significant compromises in security,” DE said.

However, Yu claimed to be unsure if Google’s authenticator is the ‘key point’ in this attack, adding, “There’s no need to panic. If the impact is large, the performance of related events should be more exaggerated. Let’s wait for more disclosures.”
SlowMist claims that they are tracking the wallets of the hacker behind the breach of the two accounts and have asked anyone suffering a similar exploit to contact them.

Bitcoin's Consolidation Phase Hits Record Duration: Analyst | Bitcoinist.com


								Bitcoin (BTC), the largest cryptocurrency asset continues to attract positive sentiment due to its recent price uptick. Popular crypto analyst and trader Mags has delved into the current price action of BTC, highlighting that the crypto asset’s current consolidation phase is the longest in its history, unfolding in the midst of an ongoing bull cycle.
This extended period of consolidation often precedes substantial volatility, which raises the possibility that Bitcoin could be preparing for a big comeback.
End Of Consolidation Phase To Trigger Notable Price Movement
For a record-breaking amount of time (87 days), Bitcoin has been trading in an extremely narrow range that has outlasted prior periods of consolidation. Mags points out that despite the general bullish feeling in the market, which usually propels more substantial price swings, there is a lot of consolidation taking on. 

According to the crypto expert, before entering price recovery, BTC often consolidates around its all-time highs, as seen in past bull cycles. However, the current consolidation is the longest of all of them.
During the 2027 bull cycle, Mags noted that the crypto asset consolidated for about 48 days before breaking out on the upside. Also, in 2020, BTC witnessed a 21-day consolidation period before regaining its upward momentum. 
BTC consolidating for 87 days thus far | Source: Mags on X
Meanwhile, in this current cycle, BTC has been consolidating for the past 87 days and still counting, surpassing the durations of previous consolidation phases. Thus, the crypto analyst claims there will be a huge upside rise whenever the price breaks out of this stabilizing phase.
The post read:
Each cycle, we have noticed a similar pattern where Bitcoin consolidates near all-time highs before it enters price discovery. Out of all the consolidations, the current one is the longest. 
Although the recent stabilizing phase has turned out to be the longest, crypto expert, Milky Bull has underscored the significance of the development. Milky Bull is confident that the consolidation will lead to significant price movements. “The longer the consolidation the higher it moves when it breaks out,” the expert stated.
Furthermore, he has pointed out a bullish divergence for BTC, which also indicates a robust price strength. Should the crypto asset break out of the current consolidation phase, Milky Bull anticipates a surge to the $85,000 price level before rising to the $110,000 mark.
Bitcoin Demonstrating Optimistic Sentiment
Following a steep decline over the weekend that caused the cryptocurrency to retreat from recent highs, Bitcoin’s price starts the week on a positive note. The weekend decline was caused by a drop in the entire crypto market, which led to major cryptocurrencies’ value plummeting.

However, Bitcoin appears to have rebounded alongside several other notable crypto assets. Due to its rebound, the digital asset has gained investor interest and generated new sentiment about its potential for long-term growth. 
At the time of writing, BTC was trading above $65,000, indicating a 0.15% increase in the last 24 hours. Its market capitalization and trading volume were also up by 0.15% and 40% in the past day.

AMD vs. NVDA: Which AI Stock Can Gain More in the Short Term? - Tokenist


					
Neither the author, Tim Fries, nor this website, The Tokenist, provide financial advice. Please consult our website policy prior to making financial decisions.



On Monday, Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) stock began trading with its new 10-for-1 stock-split adjustment. While it caused a brief -2.3% drop, NVDA shares rallied and continue to trade sideways at present $120 per share. NVDA stock is now “cheaper” than the company’s long-standing competitor at that price point.



Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ: AMD) is trading at $163 per share, 75% above its 52-week low point of $93.11. Year-to-date, AMD is only up 19%, compared to NVDA, which is 151%.



Given that Nvidia’s stock split now acts as a foil against the “missing the boat” mentality, is Nvidia likely to gain further ground, or does AMD hold surprises to catch up?



Shifting Market Domains for NVDA and AMD



Both companies compete in the PC market as their original bread and butter. AMD, in particular, dominates the console gaming market, with the PS5’s GPU hailing from AMD’s RDNA 2 architecture. Likewise, Microsoft’s Xbox consoles use AMD’s CPU and GPU solutions.



This points to AMD’s prowess in the System-on-Chip (SoC) domain, further advanced by the latest accelerated processing units (APUs) in the Ryzen 8000G series. Comparable to the performance of gaming consoles, these single-package chips make a compelling case for cheap mini PCs over buying new consoles. 



However, Nvidia outgrew that sector of consumer desktops and laptops by shifting to data centers and high-performance computing (HPC). At the same time, Nvidia retains a lion’s market share in GPUs at 80% vs AMD’s 19%, per Jon Peddie data as of Q4 2023.



Yet, there was a noticeable trend of AMD increasing its market share year-over-year by 7% while Nvidia’s decreased by 2%. Nonetheless, Nvidia more than compensated with massive data center revenue growth of 427% YoY to $22.6 billion. 



For comparison, AMD reported for the same Q1 ‘24 period total revenue of $5.47 billion, which is a YoY uptick of only 2%. And of that total revenue, AMD could boast only $2.3 billion in the data center segment.





Can AMD Take the Bite out of the Nvidia-Generated AI Pie?



Clearly, Nvidia’s agility in pushing the H100 chips to train early AI language models was a critical first-mover gambit that paid off substantially. AMD now has to compete with Nvidia’s dominant 94% market share in the data center segment, per Mercury Research. Nvidia accomplished this feat by pushing its own Ageia PhysX framework for simulations, alongside numerous libraries, CUDA Toolkit, HPC SDK, Modulus, and IndeX.



In other words, Nvidia cracked the formula for seamless development of AI-powered apps in conjunction with the offering of AI chips. On the other hand, AMD’s purportedly more cost-effective MI325X accelerator chips only address the hardware side of the equation. AMD’s Vitis AI framework will then have to rely on the adoption rate of AMD’s new chips.



As of the last earnings call, AMD CEO Lisa Su expects modest growth from data center GPU revenue, from $3.5 billion guidance in January to over $4 billion by the end of 2024. In the meantime, Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella praised the AMD MI300X series, for its Azure cloud infrastructure, noting that “it offers the best price-performance on GPT-4 for inference”.



On the other hand, Elon Musk prioritized Nvidia chips for his X and xAI companies.



Moreover, it will take a while before AMD catches up with Nvidia’s in-sync releases of GPUs with proprietary CUDA Toolkit versions. As noted, these toolkits have thus far locked in many AI developers and researchers.



For those familiar with the history of Nvidia/AMD’s struggle in the PC gaming market, this mirrors the deployment of Nvidia’s real-time ray tracing (RTX), deep learning super sampling (DLSS), G-Sync, and other standards to lock in gamers. This approach landed Nvidia in a position to dominate gaming and data center segments.



Which Company Has Better Underlying Tech?



Furthering its unification strategy with APUs, AMD will deploy Embedded+ architecture, which combines Versai AI chips with Ryzen CPUs. Such embedded chips are widely used in automation and robotics. AMD’s next-gen MI325X will feature 3 nm packaging with HBM3E memory, while AMD’s new Zen 5 CPUs (codenamed “Turin”) are rumored to feature up to 192 cores and 384 threads.



Nvidia’s next GPUs, the Blackwell series, will also feature a 3 nm node process owing to TSMC’s cutting-edge foundries. Per Commercial Times’ reporting, Nvidia’s H200 will use 4 nm while B100 adopts the 3 nm process. 



Based on these trends, Nvidia and AMD appear neck and neck in the tech arena. This mirrors the two companies’ history, where their products are comparable, but AMD caters to the mid-tier sector with competitive pricing. 



This time, Nvidia managed to grab and secure a bigger AI pie with its coordinated CUDA/GPU offering. 







Does Nvidia’s Overboughtness Matter?



Nvidia’s price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio was 102 in 2024 (fiscal), estimated to lower to 47 next year. AMD’s P/E was 84 last year, and it is estimated to grow to 64 next year. With P/E ratios for both companies suggesting strong investor confidence, Nvidia’s decreased P/E points to price correction and less risky earnings growth.



Analysts believe that both AMD and NVDA stocks are good picks for AI investment thesis despite AMD’s plunge in May following lower guidance than expected. Nasdaq’s forecasting data places AMD shares at $191 average price target vs current $163. Nvidia’s average price target is $187.76 vs current $120 per share. 



This gives Nvidia stock a 56% upside potential compared to AMD’s 17%. In other words, Nvidia’s stock split was the right move at the right time, further boosting investor confidence. 



Do you think Nvidia will keep up its momentum? Let us know in the comments below.

Top Crypto Exchange Binance Reaches 200,000,000 User Milestone - The Daily Hodl


								The world’s largest crypto exchange has reached a new milestone despite facing legal and regulatory battles.
In a post on social media platform X, Binance thanks members of its community for helping the crypto exchange achieve a global user base of over 200 million. 










“Today, we celebrate 200 million – and it’s all because of YOU!
Your support is the heartbeat of our journey to one billion users.”
Aside from growing its users to more than twice the population of Germany, Binance is also the leading crypto exchange in terms of liquidity, according to a new report from digital asset analytics firm Kaiko.
The analytics firm gets its liquidity ranking from a mix of the exchanges’ trading volume, share of volume, market depth, coefficient of variation dispersion score and market quality score.
Source: Kaiko
Binance’s milestone comes following several lawsuits and fines from multiple jurisdictions’ regulatory agencies.
Last month, Canada’s anti-money laundering agency reportedly imposed a nearly $4.4 million fine on the exchange for failing to register as a foreign money services business. In November, Binance co-founder Changpeng Zhao resigned as CEO following accusations from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) that the company violated US federal laws.
And currently, Binance officials and some US lawmakers are urging the Nigerian government to release one of the company’s employees from prison after the country accused the crypto exchange of contributing to the fall of the Nigerian naira. 
Shortly after he took over as CEO, Zhao’s successor, Richard Teng, said that the exchange would move towards better compliance in a bid to claim a bigger share of the growing crypto market.

Solana (SOL) Heavyweights Wage War Against Private Mempool Operators

Over 30 validator operators were kicked off the Solana Foundation Delegation Program over the weekend, a source familiar with the matter said. While they remain validators on the network, they're no longer eligible to receive what amounted to payout boosters for validating transactions on the Solana blockchain. Many of the operators were Russians, another source said.

Ethereum-based Lending Protocol Uwulend Suffers $20 Million Exploit - The Defiant

The attack involved three transactions that converted Wrapped Bitcoin and DAI into ETH.Ethereum-based lending protocol Uwulend has been exploited to the tune of $20 million.Cyvers Alerts detected the malicious behavior early Monday morning. An attacker executed three transactions that converted WBTC and DAI into Ether.The Uwulend team informed their users via X that the platform has been paused while they investigate the situation.The wallet address linked to the Uwulend exploiter holds a whopping 1,282 ETH or $4.7 million.Notably, the UWU token didn’t react violently to the news. UWU dropped 3% to $2.91, which only adds to its overall downtrend. Over the past year, the token has shed 80% of its value and showcases a $26 million market capitalization, as per data from CoinGecko.UWU PriceCyvers Alerts team members told The Defiant that the attacker funded today’s exploit with assets withdrawn from cryptocurrency mixer Tornado Cash two days ago.They also explained that the hack took place due to an issue with a price oracle across five different tokens. “Specifically, the sUSDe asset's value is determined using a median from several sources,” Cyvers Alerts said. During the hack, five of these sources—FRAXUSDe, USDeUSDC, USDeDAI, USDecrvUSD, and GHOUSDe were manipulated.Uwulend touts itself as a decentralized non-custodial liquidity market protocol, and its website shows that the protocol has generated more than $9.3 million in fees. According to DefiLlama, it has $66 million in total value locked (TVL), which represents a near 50% drop from its late April peak of $115 million.The protocol was created by Sifu, the controversial co-founder of the now-defunct crypto exchange QuadrigaX. QuadrigaX is a Canadian company that went under in 2019 after mysteriously losing $190 million in customer funds.Sifu is yet to make any public announcement regarding Uwulend’s exploit.

Apple Stock Nears All-Time High Price Ahead of Expected AI Push - Decrypt

We do the research, you get the alpha!Get exclusive reports and access to key insights on airdrops, NFTs, and more! Subscribe now to Alpha Reports and up your game!Go to Alpha ReportsJust a whisker away from an all-time high price, Apple's stock has been soaring for the past seven weeks—a remarkable turnaround from the 13-week bearish correction that saw the tech giant lose nearly 17% of its value.The last time Apple embarked on a similar streak was back in October 2023, when it reached a record-breaking $199.11. With the current price at $195, the tech titan is just a little over 2% away from entering a new price discovery zone.Market indicators are looking robust for the long-term trend, with prices comfortably below the EMA10, and a bullish sentiment evident among traders, as shown by a Relative Strength Index (RSI) of 62 points—meaning that 62% of traders want to buy the stock.However, those playing the short-term game should tread carefully, as some speculators might be tempted to sell the news and the bullish trend. The Average Directional Index (ADX), which measures the strength of a trend, is currently at a lowly 21 points, hinting at a possible rank or an equilibrium phase before a new surge, or perhaps a much-needed bearish correction.Image: TradingviewWhat's behind this sudden price spike? It's all about the buzz surrounding artificial intelligence (AI) and the Worldwide Developers Conference (WWDC) event that begins Monday, which has been aptly dubbed "Apple Intelligence." The hype around AI has been the driving force behind the recent market rally in the tech sector worldwide, with new models and hardware being released faster than ever.Analysts expect the company to place a significant emphasis on its AI strategy at the WWDC event, which could include updates on Siri, AI-enabled features in apps, and potential partnerships with OpenAI. If so, it would be a long-awaited response to the competition.For example, Google announced its new Pixel smartphone lineup with new AI-focused Tensor chips. This upgraded hardware is powerful enough to run its Gemini model locally, as well as power generative AI features. Other brands like Samsung, Xiaomi, Motorola etc are either focusing on bringing AI features with cloud computing or leveraging the power of Qualcomm’s Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 which are all about on-device AI as well.The integration of AI technology into the Apple ecosystem is expected to bring "ample monetization" opportunities according to stock analyst Daniel Ives, which could add a tidy $30 to $40 per share to the company's growth story. Some analysts are even predicting a potential 30-40% upside from the current price, following the AI-related announcements at the event.The AI craze has led to a shift in focus for many tech giants, including Meta, Apple, Nvidia, AMD, Google, and Microsoft, who are all eager to cash in on this burgeoning technology. Nvidia has even overtaken Apple as the world's second most valuable company, thanks to its growth in the AI sector, which has also helped spike the S&P 500 index.The WWDC event will be livestreamed on Apple’s official site and YouTube channel on June 10 at 1pm ET.Edited by Andrew HaywardGenerally Intelligent NewsletterA weekly AI journey narrated by Gen, a generative AI model.

MiCA could propel euro-backed stablecoins in the Eurozone: Kaiko report - Crypto Briefing


            
            
                            
            
                            
            
            Impending Markets in Crypto Assets (MiCA) regulations are poised to transform the stablecoin landscape favorably to euro-backed stablecoins, as reported by Kaiko Research. Binance has announced restrictions on stablecoins that fall short of the new MiCA standards, while Kraken is assessing its stablecoin offerings to ensure compliance with the European Union’s criteria, which may result in the delisting of certain stablecoins for EU customers.Despite Europe’s slower adoption rate compared to the US and APAC regions, euro-backed stablecoins have seen a surge in trading volume since the year’s start. This uptick indicates a growing demand within European markets. Notably, the combined weekly volume of prominent euro stablecoins, including Tether’s EURT, Stasis EURS, and Circle’s EURCV, has surpassed $40 million since March, marking a record duration of sustained high volume.AEUR, introduced by Binance in December, has quickly dominated the euro stablecoin sector, accounting for over half of the total volume. While USD-backed stablecoins remain the market’s giants, with a staggering $270 billion in average weekly volume in 2024, euro-backed stablecoins have carved out a 1.1% transaction share, a significant rise from virtually none in 2020.Image: KaikoTrading pairs of USDT against the euro are now some of the most traded instruments, outpacing even EUR-denominated Bitcoin trading on Binance and Kraken. This trend highlights these platforms’ role as key fiat gateways for European traders.The specific stablecoins to be deemed unauthorized remain undisclosed. However, Kraken’s review of Tether’s USDT, the world’s largest stablecoin, is particularly noteworthy given its past regulatory challenges. Despite its primary trade volume occurring during US market hours, USDT remains a vital asset for European traders.While over-the-counter (OTC) trading will likely maintain USDT-EUR liquidity, the shift towards regulated alternatives such as USDC could become a preferred option for many traders, suggests the report.

Paul Krugman Debunks Fears: Why the $34 Trillion U.S. Debt Isn't Doomsday | Cryptoglobe


                                
Paul Krugman highlights the significant national debt of $34 trillion in his latest opinion piece for The New York Times (NYT), emphasizing that while it appears daunting, the historical and international context diminishes its perceived threat. 



Paul Krugman is a renowned American economist and public intellectual, known for his influential work in international economics and trade theory. Born on 28 February 1953, he earned his Ph.D. from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) in 1977. Krugman’s academic contributions, particularly his analysis of economic geography and trade patterns, earned him the Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences in 2008. 



Beyond academia, Krugman has been a prolific writer and commentator, authoring numerous books and over 20 years of columns for The New York Times. His writing often tackles contemporary economic issues, advocating for progressive policies and critiquing austerity measures. Krugman’s clear and often provocative commentary has made him a significant voice in public economic discourse. Throughout his career, he has held prestigious academic positions and has been a visiting professor at several universities, including Princeton, where he is a professor emeritus.



In an NYT article published on June 6, Krugman explains that the $34 trillion figure, although substantial, is less alarming when considered as a percentage of GDP, comparable to levels seen at the end of World War II in the U.S. and much lower than historical debt levels in countries like Japan and Britain.



Krugman asserts that most historical debt crises involved countries borrowing in foreign currencies, which left them vulnerable to liquidity crises. He cites the Latin American debt crisis in the 1980s and the European debt crisis in 2010-12 as examples. These crises were mitigated by the ability to print money to stabilize the economy, a luxury the U.S. enjoys as it borrows in its own currency.







            
            

            
            

            
            

        

Krugman acknowledges a general unease about projections showing debt as a percentage of GDP rising over the next 30 years but argues that this is manageable. He notes that unlike individuals, governments do not need to pay off their debt entirely. Historical debt, such as that from World War II, was effectively reduced through economic growth and inflation, rather than direct repayment.



Krugman references research by Bobby Kogan and Jessica Vela from the Center for American Progress, indicating that stabilizing debt as a percentage of GDP would require increasing taxes or cutting spending by 2.1% of GDP. He contends that this is a relatively small adjustment, feasible without significant economic harm, given the U.S. collects a smaller percentage of GDP in taxes compared to other wealthy nations.



The political landscape, particularly Republican policies, poses the real challenge to addressing debt concerns, according to Krugman. He points out that Republicans often criticize debt while advocating for policies that exacerbate fiscal issues, such as extending the 2017 Trump tax cuts and reducing the IRS budget, hindering efforts to collect taxes from wealthy individuals.



Krugman concludes that America’s debt issues are more a reflection of political dysfunction than economic unsustainability. He emphasizes that with the right political will, the U.S. could easily address debt concerns, but the current political climate, especially the radicalization within the GOP, hampers meaningful progress. Krugman expresses greater concern for the implications of political dysfunction on democracy than for the national debt itself.

Inside Solana's Battle Against the Crypto 'Sandwich Attack' Menace


							

Mert Montaz highlighted that validators exploiting the Sandwich attack bug on Solana are disqualified from the Solana Foundation program.



The Solana Foundation will not support validators who misuse the platform for personal gain.



Montaz noted ongoing issues with MEV and network spamming by some RPC providers.




Helius CEO, Mert Montaz, recently addressed concerns on X (formerly Twitter) regarding the Solana Foundation Delegation program, following the disqualification of some validators for malpractice.







Montaz explained how a malicious bug, known as a Sandwich attack, can manipulate transactions, causing investors to lose funds while attackers profit. He emphasized that Solana’s lack of a mempool prevents such attacks natively. However, some validators have modified their software to facilitate these attacks on the platform.



Montaz clarified that while the Solana Foundation supports validators by delegating SOL tokens, it takes a strong stance against those who misuse the platform.




“Since people are abusing the system to rob retail and then keep the profits all for themselves — Solana Foundation is not interested in retail users being robbed, especially with their own stake,” 




Montaz added that the foundation will withhold token delegations from validators involved in Sandwich attacks. He emphasized that the disqualified validators, representing less than 16% of the total stake, can still operate independently. However, the foundation will not financially incentivize validators who exploit users.









Montaz highlighted the ongoing challenge of MEV on the Solana blockchain. He also pointed to the increasing issue of malicious RPC providers spamming the network with harmful code. However, he reassured users that Helius RPCs do not contribute to this problem and are actively developing an MEV-protected endpoint.




“There are some RPC providers who spam the hell out of the network, which makes this problem much worse than it should be, and then brag about landing rates. Helius RPCs do not do this, and while we don’t have a full  mev-protect endpoint yet, we do use swqos and have less fwds.”




Montaz concluded that future stake pools will likely adopt similar policies to discourage exploitative behavior and promote a fairer environment for retail investors.

Memecoin on Coinbase’s Base Chain Flips Solana’s BONK After Explosive 426% Rally - The Daily Hodl


								The biggest memecoin on the Base blockchain is working its way through the ranks, flipping Dogecoin (DOGE) rival BONK in terms of market cap early on Monday.
BRETT, a memecoin meant to accompany the frog-themed altcoin Pepe, is up 426% in the last 30 days at time of writing, trading at $0.18.










Pepe was originally inspired by the character in the Boys Club comic series created by Matt Furie. Also in the series was Pepe’s friend, Brett, a blue creature who likes dancing and fashion, and who the BRETT coin on Base is inspired by.
BRETT has a market cap of $1.796 billion, which was briefly bigger than BONK earlier today but has since dipped slightly below by about $71 million.
In total, BRETT is up 21,317% since February when it was trading below $0.0009.
In April, blockchain tracking firm Lookonchain spotted two wallets whitelisted by the coin’s developers that inked 30,830x gains, turning just over a hundred dollars into over $3 million.
Lookonchain notes that two wallets whitelisted by the deployer for the meme asset spent 0.034 ETH, worth $102, to buy a combined 172.56 million BRETT in February.
Those wallets subsequently sold 122.74 million BRETT for 890.65 ETH worth $3.14 million on-chain via multiple wallets, printing staggering gains to the tune of 30,830x.
Whitelisted wallets are approved participants for a specific crypto event like an initial coin offering (ICO), according to Coinbase. The pseudonymous crypto analyst known as Shady says the Brett deployer whitelisted 139 addresses.

First Data Arrived from Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs Approved in the UK! - Bitcoin Sistemi

ETFs backed by Bitcoin and Ethereum in the UK have seen low trading volumes since their launch on the London Stock Exchange (LSE) on May 28. The launch took place following the approval of the UK Financial Conduct Authority (FCA).
Unlike their US counterparts, these products can only be traded by professional investors. But 21Shares, one of the issuers of these ETFs, believes that opening up these products to the retail market could be a “game changer”.


21Shares offers eight cross-listed products in the UK, four powered by Bitcoin and four powered by Ethereum. WisdomTree manages four ETFs, two each for Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH), while Invesco offers two Bitcoin-backed products. To list on the LSE, crypto ETFs must be physically backed, unleveraged and offer exposure only to Bitcoin or Ethereum.

Since their launch, the total volume of all these products was just $504,880 as of June 6. WisdomTree accounts for 59% of transaction volume, while 21Shares accounts for 41%. In contrast, Invesco's products have seen zero transaction volume so far. By comparison, spot Bitcoin ETFs in the US saw $2.5 billion worth of trading volume in a single day on Friday.





Among 21Shares' products, Ethereum offerings were more successful, accounting for 76% of transaction volumes. Within this, 21Shares' Ethereum Staking ETFs saw approximately 57% more trading volume than the Core Ethereum product without staking returns.
21Shares noted that professional investors typically trade over-the-counter (OTC), buying and selling financial instruments outside of official exchanges such as the LSE, directly with another party or through the most liquid exchange available.

Bitcoin Risk Of Sell-Off Drops Sharply As Short-Term Holder Profit Remains Low | Bitcoinist.com


								Over the weekend, Bitcoin suffered from mounting sell pressure that pushed the price below $70,000 once again. However, with the short-term hold profitability remaining low at this time, the risk of the pioneer cryptocurrency suffering further sell-offs has dropped significantly.
Bitcoin Short-Term Holder Profitability At 3.35%
Crypto analyst Ali Martinez has soothed Bitcoin investors’ nerves with new data that shows a reduced risk of sell-off. The chart which was posted in the early hours of Monday shows that Bitcoin short-term holder profitability has remained low going into the new week.

According to Martinez, the low profitability, which is currently sitting at just 3.35%, means that there is a minimal risk of sell-off at this time. This is because short-term investors are likely to wait for higher profit margins before they start selling off their holdings for profit.
The chart shows that in the last few weeks, the Bitcoin short-term holder profitability has fluctuated wildly, as the Bitcoin price has struggled to find its footing. However, looking at the profitability over a longer period of time, and it seems that short-term holders have done quite well for themselves.


Compared to where the short-term holder profitability was at the start of the month of June, these investors are seeing positive upside as of recently. However, compared to previous sell trends, the profitability will have to increase for these short-term investors to begin selling once again.
Can BTC Surge From Here?
In a previous analysis of the Bitcoin price, crypto analyst Ali Martinez has mapped out where he expects the BTC price to go from here. The analysis showed the cryptocurrency’s movements over the last year with various corrections and peaks.
Going by this data, the crypto analyst believes that the next local top for the Bitcoin price could lie around the $89,200 level. From the current price of around $69,400, this would be a 28% increase in price, and a new all-time high for the digital asset.

Additionally, another post by the analyst shows that the Taker Buy Sell Ratio on the HTX Global Exchange rose as high as 730. What this means is that there is a lot of bullish sentiment toward the cryptocurrency and the analyst believes that this could drive the next rally.
For now, the Bitcoin price continues to struggle amid mounting pressure from bears. After reaching $71,000 last week, the price has since retraced most of its gains. Currently trading at $69,429 at the time of writing, it has seen a 0.45% increase in the last week. However, it remains the largest cryptocurrency with a market cap of $1.368 trillion.

Solana meme coin Michi jumped 18% early Monday, according to data from CoinGecko, after pop artist Ariana Grande shared the meme that inspired the coin on her Instagram story. The Michi meme was edited to hold a pink “love potion,” alongside posters of a man adored with kiss prints on the wall. This is the work of a Grande fan account in reference to a music video the singer released for her single “The Boy Is Mine.”“I think the boy is hers, [I don’t know],” the post reads, followed by the image of the meme. “Hey it’s me,” a Michi Solana Instagram account commented. In the eight hours that followed Grande’s repost, Michi only moved up 3% to $0.22. But once pseudonymous crypto influencer Ansem—who previously helped propel hyped coins like Dogwifhat (WIF)—highlighted Grande’s repost on his Twitter, the chart spiked 18% to $0.26 in just an hour.This move comes after a number of celebrities have publicly announced their venture into crypto. Most notably, media personality Caitlyn Jenner launched two meme coins and musician Iggy Azalea debuted her own, while former kickboxer Andrew Tate set out on a meme coin spending spree late last week.It’s unlikely that this was part of a hack of the artist’s account, as she’s continued with her normal social media activity, including a happy birthday message to her mom.The move sparked debate on Crypto Twitter on whether or not the post happened organically. But many believe that this was simply an organic reposting of the meme. After all, Michi was a meme before it was a meme coin, and it's likely that most people sharing the image are unaware of its crypto connection.In turn, there’s a good chance that Grande has no idea that the meme coin exists, and that she instead just wanted to repost a fan-made meme promoting her freshly released music video.“The memes most of these coins are based on are already viral. If a celeb posts about said meme, it’s because it’s already viral. They’re not promoting the underlying meme coin,” a Twitter user explained. “It’s a great endorsement for the meme itself.”Decrypt reached out to Ariana Grande's team for clarification, but did not immediately receive a response.Edited by Andrew HaywardDisclaimerThe views and opinions expressed by the author are for informational purposes only and do not constitute financial, investment, or other advice.Daily Debrief NewsletterStart every day with the top news stories right now, plus original features, a podcast, videos and more.

Yes, now is the right time to teach Wall Street about decentralized oracles - Blockworks


When the NYSE went down this week — causing several erroneous trades based on bad pricing data — Blockworks’ Empire Newsletter responded to expert calls for the integration of blockchain technology with serious skepticism: 
“Wall Street just implemented the ability to settle trades in one business day versus two, and now we want to tell them about firms like Chainlink, which offer decentralized oracle networks. […] We have to be pragmatic.”
Sure, pragmatism is key, and Wall Street has historically been slow to embrace blockchain technology beyond speculation. But something has clearly shifted this year.
In 2023, when the industry was still recovering from the FTX collapse, Chainlink’s co-founder, Sergey Nazarov, surprised many at Sibos (Swift’s annual conference) by predicting that everyone at the conference would inevitably be compelled to join the blockchain industry. Fast forward to last week’s Consensus, one of the largest crypto conferences, and you saw more suits than ever before. 
While many pundits both within and outside the industry are still obsessing over dog memecoins, most seem to be missing the real trend: Institutional adoption is quietly but rapidly happening before our eyes. 
If we want crypto to merge with traditional industries and expand tenfold, we need Wall Street and capital markets to embrace it. And asset tokenization seems to be the key. While Wall Street moves at a slower pace compared to crypto startups, the idea that it can’t embrace new technology is outdated. The innovation divisions of the largest banks and asset managers are already advancing with tokenization experiments and proofs of concept, showing they can certainly understand decentralized oracles.
BlackRock, the world’s largest asset manager, seems to agree. They began their foray into crypto this January with a record-breaking bitcoin ETF, now managing around $16.5 billion. Larry Fink recently said he sees tokenization as the next big opportunity in digital assets, sending a clear signal that tokenization is not just for the crypto industry. By March, BlackRock introduced its first tokenized fund and invested in crypto startup Securitize to create a money market fund on the Ethereum blockchain. This initiative has attracted $385 million and could generate up to $88 million in annual revenue. 
But BlackRock isn’t alone. Asset managers including Franklin Templeton, Hamilton Lane and WisdomTree have tokenized ’40 Act funds to enhance security and transaction speed. UBS launched a tokenized money market fund on Ethereum, while JPMorgan and Citi have also ventured into tokenization projects. Other institutions, including HSBC, Societe Generale and the European Investment Bank, have issued tokenized bonds. Even major payments networks Visa and Mastercard are exploring settling tokenized assets on a shared ledger. In 2023, Chainlink partnered with Swift and major banks to connect Swift’s system with blockchains like Ethereum, thus enabling secure cross-chain messaging. It also recently collaborated with DTCC to embed structured data onchain. Two years ago, such collaborations between large financial institutions and a blockchain company were unprecedented, and now they are a reality.
Read more from our opinion section: It’s time to end the SEC’s war on crypto
Two major elements have finally aligned for institutions to embrace crypto: Capital markets finally understand the financial incentives enabled by crypto (crypto significantly boosts transaction efficiency, saving asset managers millions), and the technology is reaching the point of production-readiness needed to enable mass asset tokenization.
We see proof of these trends in our daily work with the largest banks and asset managers. Over the past year alone, the Chainlink Labs team has engaged globally with dozens of institutions across the global financial industry. This isn’t 2016 or 2017, when blockchain was merely a side focus for a few oddballs in the innovation wings of massive financial firms. Today, the traditional finance and capital markets industry is not just experimenting; it is making real strategic moves to integrate blockchain technology into its tech stack.
As for the NYSE glitch…imagine a system where trading halts due to technical issues are minimized, and market stability is maintained through automated checks and balances. This world is becoming a reality because the technology needed to solve these issues is here.

Chris Barrett serves as the Director of Communications at Chainlink Labs and has been involved with Chainlink since 2017. Chainlink is the only on-chain data and cross-chain platform that enables financial institutions to develop customized, flexible, compliant, and future-proof blockchain applications and tokenized assets. Before this role, he founded a leading PR agency for technology startups, where he worked with over 1,000 innovative companies. Chris is also an avid runner, having maintained a streak of running for over five consecutive years.

Cardano (ADA) Dominating Social Media Discussions


According to data provided by cryptocurrency analytics firm Santiment, Cardano (ADA) and Bitcoin (BTC) are in the lead when it comes to social media engagement.As reported by U.Today, Cardano founder Charles Hoskinson announced that the proof-of-stake network was on the verge of the Chang hard fork. The aforementioned hard fork is shaping up to be the most significant update both for Cardano itself and the broader industry, according to Hoskinson.During the "Voltaire" phase of the roadmap, Cardano will implement a new governance model that will put the community in charge. Hoskinson is convinced that Cardano will have the most advanced governance system among all blockchains. His bullish post ignited strong social media engagement, with most social media users expressing bullish sentiment. However, this buzz has not translated into any meaningful gains for ADA. Cardano's native token is up only a mere 0.5% over the past 24 hours. It remains in 11th place with a market capitalization of $15.6 billion. In the meantime, Bitcoin is being discussed precisely due to its recent price action. Last week, the largest cryptocurrency by market cap failed to top the $72,000 level last week due to strong jobs data. At press time, it is changing hands at $69,920, with bulls and bears battling for the pivotal $70,000 level. The flagship cryptocurrency also generated some social media buzz after scoring its second-highest weekly close to date. Social media users are also frequently comparing Bitcoin's market cap to major companies such as Apple, according to Santiment.

Arthur Hayes: Bitcoin 'Trend Is Clear, Central Banks Are Starting Easing Cycles' - Benzinga

BitMEX co-founder Arthur Hayes offered in his latest blog post a provocative view on global economic maneuvers and their potential impacts for crypto investors.What Happened: In “Group of Fools,” Hayes argues that the dollar-yen exchange rate is the most critical macroeconomic indicator. Instead of his earlier idea of strengthening the yen, he now observes that the central banking “charlatans” of the Group of Seven (G7) are working to convince the market that the interest rate differential between the yen and other major currencies will narrow."The problem is the weak yen," he asserts, noting that if the yen isn't strengthened, China might devalue its yuan to compete, potentially destabilizing U.S. Treasuries and threatening the Pax Americana-led financial system.Central banks’ beginning easing cycles led Hayes to revise his strategy. He sees these conditions as catalytic for a crypto bull market. "Exit the Choppa Zone," he writes, indicating that the June rate cuts by the BOC and ECB will jolt the crypto market out of its summer doldrums.Hayes emphatically suggests going long on Bitcoin BTC/USD and altcoins. "The trend is clear. Central banks at the margin are starting easing cycles," he states, adding that it's time for projects in his Maelstrom portfolio to launch their tokens now, seizing the favorable market conditions.Also Read: Arthur Hayes: ‘Major Economies To Print Even More Money’ In The Next 24 MonthsWhy It Matters: Hayes's analysis highlighted significant intersections between traditional finance and the cryptocurrency market. His predictions indicate that ongoing central bank policies could rejuvenate the crypto bull market, providing substantial opportunities for investors.In an interview over the weekend, Hayes again emphasized taking a "long" position however added on a light-hearted note, "Don’t sell, don’t get shook, don’t use too much leverage, I mean it’s pretty simple like everyone knows what they should be doing."In a late May blog post, Hayes argued that policymakers, both elected and unelected, often prefer short-term solutions, or the “easy button,” to maintain power and avoid hard choices.What’s Next: The influence of Bitcoin as an institutional asset class is expected to be thoroughly explored at Benzinga’s upcoming Future of Digital Assets event on Nov. 19.Read Next: Arthur Hayes Outlines Crypto Trading Strategies For 2024 Bull Market: ‘It’s Pretty Simple’This content was partially produced with the help of AI tools and was reviewed and published by Benzinga editors.Image created using artificial intelligence with Midjourney.

Hedge Funds Heavily Betting For Bitcoin To Fall: Will This Strategy Fail?


																Looking at the formation in the daily chart, there is no relief for Bitcoin at spot rates. Following the flash crash on June 6, prices reversed sharply from the $72,000 level, further highlighting the significance of the liquidation level. 
In the past, Bitcoin prices have recoiled from this level, with analysts expecting a short squeeze to print once this line is breached.
Hedge Funds Are Short Selling Bitcoin Futures: Will This Strategy Backfire?
Amid this slip, one analyst on X notes that hedge funds and Wall Street firms have increasingly taken short positions on Bitcoin futures contracts, expecting BTC prices to plunge. 
Though they could be net long on the spot market, taking advantage of the fee differential, the trader notes that this strategy is risky. If anything, massive losses could occur should prices unexpectedly spike. 
Between the current price point and slightly above all-time highs at $74,000, exchange data and trader notes show $12 billion worth of short positions on BTC futures. 
Hedge funds selling BTC | Source: @olvelez007 via X
This move means that hedge funds are net bearish, and since everyone knows the big boys of Wall Street are shorting, this move could backfire spectacularly.  
Even so, hedge funds selling BTC futures are nothing new. Often, hedge funds tend to short the futures of a given product and simultaneously buy the spot markets, taking advantage of the carry trade to profit. 

	Related Reading


The problem is that this hedging tactic is popular in traditional finance and has been profitable before. On the other hand, Bitcoin is a new asset class that is outside the traditional finance system. 
Accordingly, the strategy might not pan out exactly as expected, leading to massive losses.
BTC Fragile But Spot ETF Issuers On A Buying Spree
Whether Bitcoin will recover from spot rates remains to be seen. As it is, BTC is under immense selling pressure, dropping from $72,000. 
Bitcoin price trending sideways on the daily chart | Source: BTCUSDT on Binance, TradingView
Although the uptrend remains, buyers are yet to reverse the June 6 losses, meaning the path of least resistance in the short term is southwards. A break below $66,000 would completely wipe out gains of May 20, signaling a trend shift.

	Related Reading


Still, buyers are upbeat about what lies ahead. Last week, despite the contraction, all spot Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) issuers in the United States have been on a buying spree. 
Spot BTC ETF issuers buying | Source: @HODL15Capital via X
According to HODL15 Capital, in the first week of June, they added 25,729 Bitcoin. This stash is equivalent to roughly two months’ worth of mined coins and is the highest weekly buying activity since mid-March. Then, BTC rose to all-time highs of around $73,800.

Ripple Eyes Institutional Market with USD-Backed Stablecoin


							

Targets regulated markets and expands XRP Ledger utility.



Stablecoin aims to connect traditional finance with digital currencies.



Increased traffic to XRP Ledger expected to benefit the proposed stablecoin.




Ripple is poised to launch a U.S. dollar-backed stablecoin, aiming to enhance liquidity and expand utility across its XRP Ledger and Ethereum platforms. Reece Merrick, Ripple’s Middle East and Africa Managing Director, confirmed this strategic move despite ongoing legal battles with the SEC. This stablecoin promises to bolster Ripple’s offerings in regulated markets and foster a more robust infrastructure for both institutional and decentralized finance.







This launch marks a significant milestone for Ripple, representing its latest effort to bridge the gap between traditional financial systems and the evolving digital currency space. By deploying the stablecoin on both the XRP Ledger and Ethereum, Ripple seeks to improve its existing payment solutions and attract businesses seeking compliant entry points into crypto.



The introduction of the stablecoin goes beyond expanding Ripple’s infrastructure. It’s also a response to the expanding stablecoin market, currently valued at $150 billion and projected to reach $2.8 trillion to $3 trillion by 2028.










The stablecoin is expected to have a significant impact on international trade, particularly in regions like the Middle East, where many non-U.S. dollar transactions occur. Merrick emphasized the need for a reliable, legally compliant digital currency to facilitate these transactions efficiently, minimizing price fluctuation risks.



Technically, the Ripple stablecoin will leverage the XRP Ledger’s features, including the DeFi and Automated Market Maker (AMM), to enhance trading, and provide new opportunities for developers building financial applications. Additionally, it aims to drive more traffic and transactions to the XRP Ledger, ultimately boosting XRP’s usage in the financial market.

Bitcoin $350,000 Price by August? Kiyosaki's Bullish Bet Defies Market Reality ⋆ ZyCrypto


            
            
Advertisement

&nbsp

&nbsp
Bitcoin is set to reach as high as $350k by the 25th of August this year, according to the author of the New York Times bestseller Rich Dad, Poor Dad. Robert Kiyosaki, a PhD economist in question, is a known Bitcoin bull and has made bold predictions in the past regarding the digital currency.



Kiyosaki posted on X:







While Kiyosaki did tweet that the premier digital currency will reach $350k in about two and a half months, he followed up with a more realistic take by saying it is only a prediction, not a lie. He also stated that he is going to keep buying more Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Solana because he is certain their prices will continue to rise as well.



Are Kiyosaki’s Predictions Reliable?



Kiyosaki then followed up with vitriol against the President, Fed chairman Gary Powell, and Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen. He is known to be critical of the US government’s irresponsible fiscal policies, and he prefers BTC because of its declared scarcity.



However, just a couple of months ago, Kiyosaki tweeted a prediction that the digital currency would reach as high as $100k by the end of June. We are already a week into the new month, and the index is currently stuck just above $70k. Even a new All-Time High (ATH) has been elusive. It is still achievable but getting tougher with each passing day, and there is no clear price uptick.

&nbsp



Bitcoin to $350k in 80 Days?



Bitcoin has a lot of ground to cover to reach the massive $350k valuation by August 25 of this year. The index will need to appreciate roughly 500% to achieve this milestone, and the total market capitalization will cross the $6 trillion valuation in the process.



Theoretically, 5x moves in the premier digital currency have happened before but not in such a short time since 8 years. So, Kiyosaki’s prediction of a $350k Bitcoin in such a short amount of time is quite unrealistic overall. While it may be possible at the end of the current bull market, it certainly has little chance by August.



However, his June prediction of $100k is still in the books and the end of this month is highly anticipated as it would set the tone for the second half of the calendar year. Bulls would be looking to record a new ATH even if the $100k price target isn’t achieved.

A Cryptocurrency Exchange Stops Trading: Users Cannot Withdraw Their Assets - Bitcoin Sistemi

Lykke, a UK-based crypto exchange, announced that it suspended trading on June 6 due to “unauthorized access” to its platform.
The suspension comes two days after the exchange's security breach, as first reported by web researcher SomaXBT. MetaMask developer and crypto defense expert Taylor Monahan also states that the exchange suffered a loss of $ 22 million from suspicious outflows.


Lykke, which recorded $2.5 million in cumulative volume last month, is currently preventing its users from withdrawing their assets from the platform. A few users reported missing account balances, indicating a potential hack.
Approximately half of the stolen amount is in Bitcoin, and the rest consists of Ethereum, Litecoin and Bitcoin Cash, according to onchain data. The data also reveals that ETH withdrawn from the exchange was immediately converted into the DAI stablecoin issued by MakerDAO.





At the same time, the seized Bitcoin was distributed to multiple wallets; This is a typical strategy used by hackers to hide the transaction trail during money laundering.
The stock market remained largely silent about the incident. On June 6, Lykke CEO Richard Olsen apologized for the platform's downtime in an email to customers.



“We are still investigating the causes of this security incident,” Olsen said in the email. He reassured customers that their funds were safe and said “Lykke is a diversified business with strong capital reserves.”
The exchange's website currently displays a message stating that the platform is “under maintenance following security” and “will not be active until further notice.”





This is the second crypto exchange attack in the last two weeks, following the theft of $320 million from the DMM Bitcoin platform on May 31.

Solana vs. Ethereum Feud Intensifies with Validator Ouster


								The Solana Foundation has expelled a number of validator operators from its influential delegation program. This action is attributed to their involvement in executing “sandwich attacks” against unsuspecting network users, a form of predatory trading that undermines network integrity. The decision adds a new layer to the escalating rivalry between Solana and Ethereum, highlighting broader concerns over network governance and the ethical dimensions of validator operations.
Tim Garcia, the Validator Relations Lead, made the announcement via Discord, emphasizing the finality of the Foundation’s decision: “A group of operators in the Solana Foundation Delegation Program have been removed from the program due to violations […] Decisions in this matter are final. Enforcement actions are ongoing as we detect operators participating in mempools which allow sandwich attacks.”
Mert Mumtaz, founder and CEO of Helius Labs, provided a detailed explanation of the issues at hand. He described a sandwich attack as a manipulative trading strategy where malicious actors exploit the ordering of transactions to disadvantage retail investors, ensuring they receive the worst possible prices.

“This is not natively possible on Solana because the client does not have a mempool,” Mumtaz explained. “Certain actors have added mods to their validators to enable sandwiching on Solana.” He stressed that the SOL Foundation’s primary goal is to protect retail users from these attacks, reinforcing that while the ousted operators can still function on the network, they will no longer benefit from Foundation subsidies.
Solana Vs. Ethereum Rivalry Heats Up
The incident has drawn sharp criticism from Ethereum community stalwarts, including Ryan Berckmans, an esteemed investor known as ryanb.eth. He critiqued SOL’s approach to solving issues related to MEV, questioning the network’s seriousness as a settlement layer.
“The Solana Foundation provides financial support to many validators because running a Sol validator costs $65k+/year. Now, the next step in their plan to solve MEV was to pull financial support from validators who extract MEV. Solana is not a serious settlement layer,” Berckmans asserted.
Countering Berckmans’ criticisms, Mumtaz highlighted the financial and operational disparities between Solana and Ethereum validators. “You haven’t done the work required to have an informed opinion,” Mumtaz retorted, pointing out that while Solana validators have lower setup costs compared to Ethereum’s 32 ETH minimum stake requirement.
“Perhaps you’re forgetting that with the 32 ETH minimum, it costs ~120kfor Eth, double Solana — *and* while SOL validator revenue has surpassed Eth multiple times in the past month. this isn’t pulling “support from validators doing mev,” he stated and clarified that the SOL Foundation is “simply not giving out subsidies to malicious validators who sandwich, who rob retail and then keep all the rewards with 0 network/in-protocol distribution—it’s purely extractive.”

Furthering the dialogue, Lucas Bruder, CEO of Jito Labs, defended the Foundation’s position, emphasizing the alignment of interests between the Foundation and the broader network. “The Solana foundation is a staker on the network. Stakers should want to see the network be successful. Why would they support something that decreases the likelihood of the network being successful?” he posited.
However, Bruder also acknowledged the predominant nature of memecoin trading and the potential risks of alienating this user base. “Most activity on Solana is memecoin trading, so if you screw over the main user base of the blockspace, they’ll leave and we’ll all be sitting here with less usage wondering why tf we didn’t do anything,” he argued, stressing the need for long-term solutions to network challenges.
Ryan Berckmans doubled down on his critique, stating: “So if the Solana Foundation doesn’t use their centralized power to incentivize validators to stop extracting max MEV, then memecoin traders may get fed up and switch to a fast cheap chain with less potential for MEV extraction, like the Base Ethereum L2, and then Solana would be a ghost chain. I think this story writes itself. The SOL/ETH ratio vastly overstates Solana’s durability as a serious competitor to either the Eth L1 or our best L2s.”
This ongoing debate underscores the heated rivalry between SOL and ETH as well as the complexity of governance in decentralized networks, the technical challenges associated with MEV, and the strategic decisions that can significantly impact the perceptions and functionality of blockchain ecosystems.
At press time, SOL traded at $158.03.

What Andrew Tate's 'crypto insanity' has to do with Vitalik Buterin - AMBCrypto



Andrew Tate stirred a crypto storm over the weekend and flipped it into donation calls. 
His calls echoed with Vitalik Buterin’s vision for ‘better memecoins.’ 

After spiking a massive crypto storm over the weekend, social media influencer and former kickboxer Andrew Tate has nudged those who benefit from his shilling campaigns to donate for social good. 
‘Anyone who made money from my crypto insanity and wants good Karma can donate to Tate Pledge. Feeding starving children is always rewarded by god.’ 
So, what’s the “crypto insanity” that is he referencing? 
On Friday, Tate challenged his over 9 million X (formerly Twitter) followers that he would ‘own the crypto market’ if his post hit a certain number of retweets. Later on, the influencer posted another provocative post stating that, 
“I will crash the Solana network.”
Andrew Tate crypto frenzy felt in Solana
By ‘crash the Solana network,’ the former kickboxer meant shilling and buying the various memecoins in large volumes that could overwhelm the network. 
One of the memecoins the influencer promoted was Real Ni**er Tate [RNT]. As of press time, the token traded at $0.041, up 4% on the daily chart. 
However, over the weekend, the token hit a massive $170 million in trading volume. 
Another meme linked to Tate, TOPG, also hit a record trading volume of $238 million on the 8th of June, Coingecko data revealed. 
Reportedly, the TOPG developer offered Tate over 50% of the token’s supply, which the influencer later burned to pump up the tokens. 
Later on, the influencer stated that he made zero but turned people into millionaires on Solana. 
‘I’ve made over 100M trade through Solana, and I’ve turned people into millionaires. I’ve made zero. Zero. I just bought coins and held them to dust. I will make zero money because I am a real n*gger’ 
From crypto promotion to social good?
However, on Monday, the influencers called on those who benefited from his crypto shilling to donate part of the gains to the social good that he champions. 
Interestingly, Tate’s vision echoed with recent Vitalik Buterin’s recent arguments about celebrity involvement in the memecoin. 
Notably, Buterin had called for celebrity coins for social good as opposed to financial gains. 
“I’m feeling quite unhappy about with ‘this cycle’s celebrity experimentation’ so far.
However, other celebrities like Australian Iggy Azalea have taken the ‘financial path’ with her Mother Iggy [MOTHER] token.

Arthur Hayes Predicts Dogecoin Will Get An ETF This Cycle


																Regulators will inevitably approve a Dogecoin ETF after both Bitcoin and Ethereum hit US public markets, according to BitMEX co-founder Arthur Hayes.
During a Sunday interview alongside Real Vision CEO Raoul Pal, the two investors reviewed their favorite meme coin and crypto picks this cycle, as well as the top risks currently looming over the industry.
Why Memecoins Will Keep WInning: Arthur Hayes
According to Hayes, meme coins still have plenty of runway this cycle, with the market bound to get “even crazier” as the Federal Reserve and US Treasury print more and more money.
“For the person who has just been initiated into crypto, it’s literally the easiest thing to understand,” said Hayes. “I don’t need to understand blockchain, and AI, and crypto, and cryptography.”
In a blog post last week, Hayes argued that the time had come to “go long Bitcoin and subsequently shitcoins,” in response to back-to-back interest rate cuts by both the Bank of Canada and the European Central Bank. Historically speaking, low interest-rate environments bode well for stocks and Bitcoin, which causes capital to spill over into the riskier, more volatile memecoin market.




Both Hayes and Pal said they’ve got parts of their portfolio locked up in dog-themed coins including Dogecoin (DOGE), BONK, and dogwifhat (WIF).
The investors also agreed that Dogecoin would receive ETF approval in the United States by the end of the current bull market cycle.
“It’s the oldest memecoin, it’s on Robinhood,” said Hayes. “If you’re thinking about Tradfi getting into crypto and they’re gonna put an ETF on anything they can, it’s a high market cap thing. “
Dogecoin is currently up 136% over the past year. Since launching in December, WIF has mooned by nearly 1600%.
Trends To Watch This Cycle
Regarding other cryptos, Pal said he’s “ninety percent” into Solana, calling it “the right bet to have.” By contrast, Hayes said he predicts that Aptos – the 27th-ranked crypto by market cap size – to flip Solana “in the layer 1 game” within the next 1 to 3 years.
In terms of what to avoid, both men agreed that Cardano is a “narrative of the last cycle,” with Pal also taking a stab at Ripple (XRP).
The men also had similar worries about what could pose major risks to crypto during this cycle.
Both highlighted large centralized venues that control massive sections of the crypto market. Pal expressed concern over Derebit’s 90% market dominance in the options market, while Hayes argued that Coinbase and various banks – which control the Bitcoin backing the world’s largest Bitcoin ETFs – could lose customers a lot of money.
“If I’m gonna hack crypto, I’m going after one of these US custodians – one of these banks,” Hayes said. “Never have they had to custody an asset where if they lose it they can’t call up the Treasury or the Fed and get another bailout.”

SocialFi Application Friend.tech Leaving Base Blockchain in Move To Develop Own Network - The Daily Hodl


								SocialFi application protocol Friend.tech (FRIEND) says it’s leaving Coinbase’s Base chain to develop its own network.
In a new thread, the team behind the social finance platform says that it will be partnering up with Conduit, a firm that provides Ethereum (ETH) rollups, to work on Friendchain, its very own blockchain that will utilize FRIEND as its gas token.










“We’re pleased to be working with Conduit on Friendchain, our own blockchain that uses FRIEND as a fully transferable gas token. We’ll keep you up-to-date with all the info you need over the coming months as we build out this exciting new chapter.”
According to Friend.tech, users can sign up for the upcoming Friendchain testnet, but no specific date was mentioned for its launch.
Friend.tech, which launched in 2023, allows users to link their X accounts to a crypto wallet address, creating a social decentralized finance (DeFi) space where fans and creators can directly engage with one another.
“[Friend.tech] allows users to have a direct engagement with creators, which might not be possible in common channels. For example, a basketball fan can buy [NBA player] Grayson Allen’s Key to have a conversation with him. Another feature is it allows the resale value of the membership. Users can bet on the growth of the profiles or creators by buying their keys.” 
Data from market intelligence firm Dune Analytics reveals that Friend.tech has nearly $9 million in Total Value Locked (TVL) and just over 916,800 users who have completed at least one trade on the platform.
FRIEND is trading for $0.791 at time of writing, a nearly 20% decrease during the last 24 hours.

GameStop Dumps 15% as Roaring Kitty Jokes About His Plunging Position - Decrypt

We do the research, you get the alpha!Get exclusive reports and access to key insights on airdrops, NFTs, and more! Subscribe now to Alpha Reports and up your game!Go to Alpha ReportsThe meme stock influencer Keith Gill, better known as Roaring Kitty or DeepFuckingValue, took an online jab at himself on Monday over the plummeting value of his GameStop holdings.“You were a billionaire,” a meme image he posted to Twitter (aka X) read, showing an illustration of a man pointing intently at himself in the reflection of a mirror.Meanwhile, GameStop shares have fallen 15% on the trading day to about $24, showing a 63% decrease relative to their peak price of $64.75 last week. Previously, amid Gill’s online return, shares in the video game retailer had spiked as high as $64.83 around mid-May.Gill’s overall attitude was upbeat Friday as the influencer sipped beer and livestreamed to over 700,000 viewers on YouTube for the first time in years. That was despite a steep drop in GameStop’s share price, which at the time had netted the influencer $235 million in daily losses on paper for the purported holdings he showed on-screen.“It is what it is. What am I going to do?” he said before the online crowd that had gathered to watch him riff on GameStop and witness his disclaimer-laden investment thesis.Previously posting screenshots of his E*Trade account on Reddit, Gill at one point held a mix of GameStop shares and call options worth $586 million. As of his latest “YOLO update,” the influencer was pushing paper gains of $382 million last week.Several prominent Twitter accounts in the finance space speculated that Gill was on target to becoming a billionaire as GameStop recently soared, including Unusual Whales. That was if the stock’s price could hold above the $65 mark before Gill’s stream, the account stated last Thursday.The announcement of Gill’s livestream sparked a sharp increase in GameStop’s stock price, but the rally was short-lived. By the time Gill appeared on his livestream Friday, the stock’s price had slipped over 30% from its previous closing price.Gill became the de facto face of a retail-led movement to bet big on Wall Street short sellers through GameStop in 2021. And it wasn’t until the influencer started posting again on Twitter last month that interest in the video game retailer’s shares was broadly reignited.As of this writing, GameStop shares have fallen 8% over the past five trading days from $26.19. Still, the stock’s value has increased 38% compared to around when Gill started posting online again in mid-May.While Gill’s Reddit account remains untouched since showing gains last week, the influencer’s Twitter activity has continued apace. Posting an image of a green Uno card a week prior, Gill shared a screenshot from the opening of the Batman movie “The Dark Knight” late Sunday—but with a cat mask swapped in.Edited by Andrew HaywardDisclaimerThe views and opinions expressed by the author are for informational purposes only and do not constitute financial, investment, or other advice.Daily Debrief NewsletterStart every day with the top news stories right now, plus original features, a podcast, videos and more.

Crypto ETPs See $2,000,000,000 in Inflows Amid Anticipation of Rate Cuts: CoinShares - The Daily Hodl


								Digital assets manager CoinShares says institutions poured two billion dollars into crypto products last week alone.
In its latest Digital Asset Fund Flows report, CoinShares says digital asset investment products reached $2 billion last week, equaling the totals from the four weeks prior.










“Digital asset investment products saw inflows totaling US $2bn, bringing this recent five-week run of inflows to US$4.3bn. Trading volumes in ETPs rose to US$12.8bn for the week, 55% up from the week prior. Unusually, inflows were seen across almost all providers, with a continued slowdown in outflows from incumbents. We believe this turnaround in sentiment is a direct response to weaker than expected macro data in the US, bringing forward monetary policy rate cut expectations.”
Source: CoinShares
Regionally, the United States raked in nearly $2 billion in inflows alone, seeing the record third-largest daily inflow records on the first day of the period.
The largest crypto by market cap, Bitcoin (BTC), per usual, took the lion’s share of the inflows at $1.97 billion.
“… while short-bitcoin saw outflows for the 3rd week in a row totaling US$5.3m.”
Ethereum (ETH) led all altcoins with $69 million in inflows. XRP, Chainlink (LINK), Solana (SOL) and BNB brought in $1.2 million, $0.7 million, $0.7 million, $0.7 million and $0.2 million, respectively.

DePin News: io.net CEO Leaves, Helium Mobile Grows, and More


Decentralized Physical Infrastructure Networks (DePin) are transforming the tech landscape by enabling decentralized projects in real-world infrastructure.
Here’s what happened recently in the DePin sector: io.net’s CEO stepped down just before their token launch, Helium Mobile reached over 92,000 subscribers, and the number of active decentralized physical infrastructure projects grew to more than 1,200.
CEO of io.net Steps Down
Solana-based decentralized infrastructure provider io.net, which allows users to monetize their GPU power, has recently replaced its CEO just two days before the launch of its native token on Binance Launchpad. The token launch, scheduled for Tuesday, June 11, is part of io.net’s ambitious plans to become the world’s largest AI computing network. Co-founder Ahmad Shadid stepped down immediately, and fellow co-founder and former COO Tory Green stepped in as his successor.

In an effort to address speculation about his departure, Shadid has provided an explanation for his decision. He stresses that the firm remains committed to growth and success, and his departure aligns with this vision. 

“While there have been allegations regarding my past, I want to emphasize that I am stepping down as CEO to allow io.net to move forward without distraction and to focus on its growth and success,” Shadid said.

Io.net aggregates GPU resources to create a network offering machine learning startups affordable computing power, significantly reducing costs compared to traditional cloud services. However, io.net has faced heavy criticism. 
Observers argue that io.net misled the community about its GPU capabilities and question why it sets prices instead of allowing compute owners to do so. Furthermore, a GPU metadata attack on April 28 caused active GPU connections to plummet from 600,000 to 10,000, exacerbating concerns about the network’s reliability and transparency.
Helium Mobile Crosses 92,000 Subscribers
Helium Mobile now has more than 92,000 subscribers, showing the rising interest in decentralized wireless networks. Helium’s model uses blockchain technology to reward users for setting up and maintaining wireless coverage, which has attracted a large community and expanded its network.

Every time a new subscriber signs up, an NFT is minted, adding to the decentralized network’s appeal. Users can also earn MOBILE tokens by doing tasks like “Discovery Mapping,” where they share their location to help improve coverage. These tokens can pay for their phone plans or be traded for other cryptocurrencies.

Helium Mobile offers a $20 per month plan for unlimited talk, text, and data. It uses both the Helium network and T-Mobile’s infrastructure to provide coverage. This combination, along with strong community support and smart strategies, shows how successful decentralized models are becoming in telecommunications​.
The Number of Active DePin Projects Surpassed 1,200
The DePin ecosystem is flourishing, with 1,215 active projects currently underway, a total market cap of $47 billion, and an annual revenue run rate of $15 million, according to the DePin Ninja dashboard. 

Projects range from decentralized wireless networks to community-driven energy grids, showcasing the diverse applications of DePin technologies. The top five by market cap include Fetch.ai ($4.3 billion), Render ($3.56 billion), Filecoin ($3.3 billion), The Graph ($2.5 billion), and Arweave ($2.5 billion).

These developments point to a promising future for DePin, with rising user engagement and a growing number of active projects paving the way for decentralized solutions across various infrastructure sectors. Although DePin is still in its early stages and has several flaws, it enables the exchange of tokens between synthetic and real-world assets. This complements traditional infrastructure by providing last-mile coverage in areas where conventional models are not economically feasible.

Arbitrum DAO Approves Massive Gaming Fund | Bankless


Arbitrum DAO has approved a proposal to allocate 225M ARB (~$215M) over the next three years to supporting gaming projects. What's the scoop?Proposal Details: The Gaming Catalyst Program (GCP), proposed by Vela Exchange co-founder Dan Peng, aims to expand awareness and adoption of Arbitrum, Orbit, and Stylus with builders and players in the gaming community.Voting Results: The proposal passed with over 75% of votes in support, including entities like L2Beat, Wintermute, and Treasure DAO. Other major organizations opposed it, though, like Blockworks Research and Camelot DAO.Fund Allocation: The funds will be used for grants and investments of up to 500K ARB (~$484K) for new and established developers, infrastructure-related bounties, and operational expenses. A maximum of $25M is earmarked for the GCP team to manage day-to-day operations.Bankless Take:For years, gaming has been heralded as one of the industries most ripe for Web3 disruption. Despite this, few, if any, crypto-based games have achieved traction. That hasn’t stopped massive amounts of capital from being funneled into the mission to realize this integration of blockchains, even while returns from the sector continue to lag significantly behind other areas like AI, RWAs, and Bitcoin Layer 2s. That being said, one game may be all a chain needs to succeed, which could keep fueling this golden goose hunt, especially given Arbitrum’s support for Xai Network, a gaming-focused L3 on Arbitrum, and TreasureDAO, a gaming ecosystem that recently announced it would build a L3 on the network.

GameStop Could Start 'Biggest Bitcoin Adoption Story Of The Year' With This Move, Trader Suggests - GameStop (NYSE:GME) - Benzinga

Heavily-followed crypto trader The Bitcoin Therapist proposed that GameStop GME could significantly benefit from adopting a Bitcoin BTC/USD standard.What Happened: The Bitcoin Therapist suggested that GameStop could raise over $5 billion by issuing shares and converting this capital into Bitcoin at $70,000 per BTC. He outlined that this would result in approximately 71,400 BTC, potentially making it the most significant Bitcoin adoption story of the year.The trader emphasized that such a move could increase demand for GameStop’s stock and expand its base of Bitcoin holders.He further noted, "They are already an exceptionally overvalued company. They could continue to accrue Bitcoin and issue debt/shares to acquire more Bitcoin." This strategy, according to him, could reinvent GameStop's brand and facilitate its transition into a more serious digital gaming and commerce platform.The trader concluded the post with a challenge to GameStop, "Your move GameStop."Also Read: GameStop’s Roller Coaster: Roaring Kitty’s Live Stream Countdown Ignites Investor ExcitementWhy It Matters: Bitcoin Therapist's suggestion comes at a time when GameStop has been exploring various strategies to reinvent itself. The company has been in the spotlight for its volatile stock price and efforts to pivot towards digital and blockchain technologies.The potential for GameStop to hold a significant amount of Bitcoin could position it uniquely in the market, differentiating it from other retailers.During the Q1 earnings release, the company filed a prospectus supplement with the SEC regarding its at-the-market offering program, which allows the sale of up to 75 million shares. Before this capital raise, it had sold 45 million shares in mid-May raising around about $933.4 million in gross proceeds.What’s Next: The influence of Bitcoin as an institutional asset class is expected to be thoroughly explored at Benzinga’s upcoming Future of Digital Assets event on Nov. 19.

Monero price defies gravity ahead of the BitBot token launch



                    

                    Monero price continued to defy gravity as it surged to its highest point since January 30th. It has surged by over 80% from its lowest level this year, giving it a market cap of over $3.2 billion. The focus among cryptocurrencies is now shifting to the upcoming Federal Reserve interest rates decision and the ongoing ETF inflows.
Monero is defying gravity
Cryptocurrencies wavered on Monday as focus remained on the upcoming Fed decision. Bitcoin held steady below the crucial resistance point at $70,000. Other big cryptocurrencies like Ether and Solana remained in a tight range.
Many altcoins, on the other hand, went through a major sell-off as concerns about the Federal Reserve continued. This sell-off happened after the US published strong jobs numbers on Friday, raising the possibility that the Fed will hold rates steady in this week’s meeting. 
Monero, the biggest privacy coin in the world, was the best-performing token even though there was no major ecosystem news. Notably, the rally continued as Monero formed a golden cross pattern, which happens when the 50-day and 200-day moving averages cross each other. 
In most cases, this is one of the most popular bullish signs in the market. Most importantly, the token has risen above the key resistance level at $180, its highest swing in December last year.
Therefore, there is a likelihood that the bull run will continue in the coming days. If this happens, it will likely surge to the next level at $200. The stop-loss of this trade will be at $170. 

BitBot is seeing strong traction
It is against this backdrop that the BitBot token is gaining more traction in the market a few weeks after it concluded its highly-successful token sale. The developers raised over $4.3 million from investors. 
BitBot’s token sale was highly successful because of what the network is promising. According to its website, the developers are aiming to create the biggest AI-powered Telegram trading bot. 
This is notable because of Telegram’s scale as one of the biggest social media companies in the world with over 900 million users. 
The Telegram bot industry is doing well as demand for trading solutions jump globally. Recent data showed that these bots account to over $164 million worth of tokens every day.
As such, there are signs that it will gain traction because of its emphasis on AI and security. Unlike other Telegram bots, BitBot will be a non-custodial platform, meaning that its developers will not have access to users funds. 
BitBot’s developers are now working on the application. They are also preparing to launch the claiming process for the token. This is a situation where those who bought the tokens will be able to claim them when they start trading. Learn more about BitBot here.

$3 XRP Price Beckons As Ripple Pens Deal With Georgia’s Central Bank To Revolutionize Economy ⋆ ZyCrypto

&nbsp

&nbsp
The company behind the cryptocurrency XRP, Ripple, has struck a deal with the Republic of Georgia to digitize the local economy. Top officials from the National Bank of Georgia (NBG) recently met with the crypto firm’s executives to boost alliance in financial technology and digitalization.



National Bank Of Georgia Banks On Ripple’s Technology To Digitize Economy 



Ripple, a leading provider of enterprise blockchain solutions for cross-border payments, is strengthening ties with the Republic of Georgia.



According to a LinkedIn post on June 8 by the National Bank of Georgia, Natia Turnava, acting governor of the NBG, and Varlam Ebanoidze, head of the bank’s financial and supervisory technology development department, had discussions with Ripple’s vice president of central bank engagements, James Wallis.



The purpose of the meeting was to determine areas of collaboration in promoting the digitization of the Georgian economy. During the meeting, Wallis introduced the Georgian representatives to Alistair Brown, an official at Ripple’s partner EPAM Systems. While specific details of the meeting are scanty, the talks signal progress in incorporating cutting-edge blockchain solutions into the nation’s financial infrastructure.



Previous Ripple And Georgia Partnership



The new initiative builds on the previous alliance between the Georgian central bank and Ripple, where the San Fransciso-headquartered blockchain payments company serves as the official technology partner for creating lari, its central bank digital currency (CBDC) project.

&nbsp



Back in July 2023, Ripple was hailed by Currency Research for its contributions to digital currency advancement and the most promising sustainability initiative, specifically for its role in promoting innovation in the CBDC sector.



Ripple’s Global CBDC Endeavors



Before the collaboration with the NBG for the digital lari project, Ripple had notably aligned itself with financial institutions looking to foray into CBDC developments. 



Ripple previously teamed up with Colombia, Palau, and Bhutan, among others, to create digital versions of their national currencies. Ripple released a 23-page white paper last December, reiterating its belief in the potential of central bank digital currencies to boost financial inclusion, streamline cross-border payments, and support monetary policy control.



Ripple’s continued growth comes despite ongoing legal woes stemming from a Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) case against the firm lodged in December 2020. The legal battle is now headed for a conclusion after both Ripple and the securities regulator filed final responses. Analysts anticipate a final judgment around September when Judge Analisa Torres will rule on the appropriate remedies. 



As Ripple garners more large-scale adoption and the long-standing lawsuit nears climax, crypto enthusiasts will closely watch the company’s growth as ultra-bullish use cases look poised to catapult XRP to new historic highs with bulls eying the $3 aspirational level.



XRP is changing hands at $0.4974 as of publication time, a -0.1% change over the last 24 hours.

Coinbase Proposes New Metric To Accurately Track Blockchain and Crypto Adoption - The Daily Hodl


								Coinbase, the largest crypto exchange in the US, says there’s a need to accurately measure the true adoption of blockchains beyond what already exists.
In a new blog post, Coinbase says that as more applications launch, tracking the adoption of blockchain ecosystems becomes difficult as traditional metrics like total transactions or daily active addresses become distorted due to spam and Sybil attacks – an exploit that involves the forging of multiple identities in peer-to-peer networks.










To address these difficulties, Coinbase proposes using the h-index, which was originally created to measure the productivity and impact of scientific publications.
Coinbase says it has taken the h-index and adapted it to blockchains by tracking the number of addresses that have been on the receiving end of transactions the same number of times.
Says Coinbase,
“The h-index originated in academia as a way to quantify the research output and impact of a researcher, calculated by counting the number of publications that have been cited at least that same number of times. (For example, five publications that have been cited five times each would have an h-index of five.) 
We have adapted this metric to measure the activity on blockchain networks by looking at the number of addresses that have been on the receiving end of transactions at least that same number of times. In other words, an h-index of 100 means that 100 different receiving addresses had received transactions from at least 100 unique sending addresses over a given time frame.”
Using the new metric, Coinbase says that out of all the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM)-compatible chains, ETH has the strongest level of adoption, followed by Base, Arbitrum (ARB), Optimism (OP), Polygon (MATIC), Avalanche (AVAX) and Fantom (FTM).
“Our findings indicate that Ethereum and Base have the most widespread user activity of those measured, with Arbitrum and Polygon PoS following close behind.”

Solana To Flip Ethereum And Become "Altcoin Leader" In Next Bull Cycle: Analyst


								Solana and top cryptocurrencies like Ethereum and Bitcoin are struggling at spot rates. Following the plunge on June 6, prices are under pressure, cementing the position of sellers who have been dominant since late May 2024. 
Will The Solana Uptrend Remain?
Even so, some analysts are upbeat, expecting not only altcoins to recover in the sessions ahead but specifically for Solana, a top-5 coin, to emerge as a leader in the next cycle. 

In a post of X, one analyst noted that provided bulls maintain the current uptrend, rejecting any attempt for lower lows, SOL will continue to float higher. 
Solana in an uptrend | Source: @0xGumshoe via X
Of note, this will continue the trend seen from the better part of H2 2023, when the coin rose from obscurity to become one of the top performers, even outdoing Bitcoin. Looking at the daily chart, SOL is up 100% from January 2023 lows and roughly 8X from the pits of September 2023.
Even though there has been a cool-off after the rally to as high as $210 in March 2024, the uptrend remains. So far, SOL is down 25% from March peaks, with prices retesting a key support trend line. As bulls soak in selling pressure, attempting to reject bears of June 6, keeping prices above $160 will be crucial.

Though technical candlestick formations support this bullish outlook, there are favorable developments from the fundamental side of the equation. 
Solana Finds Adoption But Will Regulators Crack The Whip?
Increasingly, more financial institutions are integrating Solana to future-proof their offerings. So far, PayPal, Visa, and Stripe support Solana. 
Most importantly, as they integrate Solana, they recognize the need to adapt to rapidly changing user preferences, most of which are looking for cheaper and faster transactions. Solana boasts a theoretical throughput of up to 65,000 transactions per second (TPS).
Meanwhile, though Ethereum has the largest network, it can only process 15 transactions every second, negatively impacting transaction fees. Depending on network demand, transferring tokens or executing smart contracts on Ethereum can be expensive. Fees fluctuate and, at one point, rose to over $50, according to YCharts data.

Though Solana is fast becoming a choice for institutions and meme coin deployers, there are ongoing challenges. In lawsuits filed by the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) against Binance and Coinbase, the regulator alleges that Solana is an unregistered security. 

At the same time, unlike BTC and ETH, SOL, listed on the CME market, lacks a developed futures market. This absence, considered when the United States SEC wants to approve an exchange-traded fund (ETF), may take years before the product goes live.

Optimism Celebrates Stage 1 Decentralization With Permissionless Fault Proofs - The Defiant

Users can now permissionlessly execute withdrawals from OP Mainnet to Layer 1 Ethereum.The Optimism ecosystem is celebrating a significant milestone in its roadmap towards decentralization.On June 10, Optimism, the team behind the Layer 2 network, OP Mainnet, launched support for permissionless fault proofs on the network. The upgrade allows users to execute ETH and ERC-20 withdrawals without requiring actions from centralized third parties, and enables any OP Mainnet user to challenge and remove invalid withdrawals in exchange for compensation.“Governance-approved, permissionless fault proofs are live on OP Mainnet, and with them, the OP Stack arrives at Stage 1 [decentralization],” Optimism said. “In the coming months, we seek to roll out additional proof systems… on testnet.”The Optimism community overwhelmingly voted in favor of adopting permissionless fault proofs in a governance proposal that ended on May 30.Permissionless fault proofs will also roll out across other networks leveraging Optimism’s OP Stack infrastructure, including Base, Mode, and Zora, in the near future.Stage 1 decentralizationOptimism said OP Mainnet has now achieved “Stage 1” decentralization, a term coined by Vitalik Buterin to describe when a Layer 2 network is operating with “limited training wheels” in place.Withdrawals from rollups are executed through the network posting a Layer 2 state root value to the Ethereum mainnet. The root value allows the Ethereum mainnet to verify that funds have been withdrawn from Layer 2.Buterin said that Stage 1 rollups must feature an operational fraud or validity proof scheme enabling a project to accept or reject state roots in a decentralized fashion.Permissionless fault proofs allow any user to post root values so long as they provide collateral that can be forfeited in the event they behave dishonestly. Accounts disputing transactions must also provide collateral that can be slashed.Buterin said that Stage 1 projects can still maintain a multisig mechanism, often referred to as a “security council,” with the authority to override fraud or validity proofs to protect a network against malicious actors. These multisig accounts must comprise at least 8 different entities from outside of the project’s development team and require approval from at least 75% of signers.“While participation in the Fault Proof System is permissionless, the Optimism Security Council retains the power to intervene and revert the system back to a permissioned state in the event of a failure in the system,” Optimism said. “Having this fallback is part of a responsible and safe rollout of the Fault Proof System.”According to L2beat, OP Mainnet is now one of four Layer 2 networks currently operating at Stage 1 decentralization, alongside Arbitrum, ZkSync Lite, and dYdX v3. L2beat also lists DeGate v1 and Fuel v1 as having achieved Stage 2 decentralization, meaning no centralized entity can post state roots for a project.“Launching fault proofs on OP Mainnet… and achieving Stage 1 decentralization are important milestones, but the endgame is Stage 2 decentralization,” Optimism said.OP Mainnet is currently the third largest Layer 2 network with a total value locked of $7.31 billion, according to L2beat.

Optimism Finally Gets Its Mission-Critical 'Fault Proofs'

“We literally deleted the entire system essentially, re-architected it, and rewrote the entire thing,” Karl Floersch, the CEO of OP Labs, said in an interview with CoinDesk. “That was brutal, but absolutely the correct decision.”

Real Vision Analyst Jamie Coutts Issues Altcoin Warning As Markets Kick Off Week in the Red - Here’s His Outlook - The Daily Hodl


								Real Vision analyst Jamie Coutts is warning that the altcoin market is in a bearish trend after a strong six-month long run.
The former Bloomberg analyst tells his 18,400 followers on the social media platform X that most alts are now being outperformed by Bitcoin (BTC).










“A quick update on the altcoin malaise. Most crypto funds are overweight alts and not having as much fun as they would like, despite having a cracking six months from Q4 2023 to Q1 2024. Despite ETH’s recent outperformance, there’s been no follow-through (top chart) and the smart contract platform (SCP) sector continues to lag behind Bitcoin. The altseason index (bottom) confirms this trend, heading lower with only 18% of the top 100 assets (excluding stables) outperforming BTC.”
Source: Jamie Coutts/X
However, the analyst predicts alts will surge later this year and that the altcoin season index, which measures the profitability of digital assets relative to BTC, could start flashing bullish for alts within months.
“I still believe a turnaround will happen in the second half of the year – sooner rather than later, as liquidity at the margins is starting to improve (recent central bank cuts). 
Altseason signal: while the short-term alt price action remains bearish, a moving average bullish cross on the top chart and a reversal on the altseason index sub-chart would be a pretty clear signal that things have changed.”

In Defense of Meme Coins

As Ravi Bakhai, who is building a meme-coin trading platform called Hype, explained, meme coins have essentially become a big, generalized betting market for determining how relevant anything is at any given time. For instance, Iggy Azalea’s MOTHER token literally put a price on her fame, and the rapper’s ability to draw an audience of crypto enthusiasts.

Friend.tech Plans to Launch Friendchain | Bankless


Friend.tech, one of the leading crypto social apps, has announced plans to move from Coinbase's Layer 2 network, Base, to its own L2 called Friendchain.What's the scoop?Friendchain will be developed in partnership with blockchain infra provider Conduit.Friend.tech’s native token, FRIEND, will serve as the upcoming L2’s gas token. The timeline for the migration from Base is yet to be announced.Bankless take:The move isn’t necessarily surprising. In May 2024, Friend.tech’s pseudonymous founder Racer offered a $200,000 bounty for a chain migration plan in a since-deleted tweet amid their rising dissatisfaction with the Base ecosystem. Beyond the Base discontent, though, Friend.tech moving to its own chain allows it greater control over its tech stack and user experience. This autonomy can enable more tailored optimizations and potentially quicker experimental iterations on the platform's features.Also, the use of FRIEND as a gas token will introduce a new economic dynamic that will be worth tracking going forward, as many L2s don’t currently use their native tokens for gas. Success here will depend on how well Friend.tech can navigate the associated risks and capitalize on the strategic opportunities it presents.

Base Meme Coin Normie Removes Video Depicting Suicide, Following Backlash - Decrypt

We do the research, you get the alpha!Get exclusive reports and access to key insights on airdrops, NFTs, and more! Subscribe now to Alpha Reports and up your game!Go to Alpha ReportsBase chain meme coin Normie has issued an apology after it posted a video depicting suicide in an attempt pump its token.The now deleted video (screenshot here; warning: disturbing content) showed the Normie character hanging itself, being buried in a cemetery, and then meeting a God-like figure. The deity tells Normie that they need to refund the community and relaunch to return to Earth. Then, the character jumps from their grave with news reports stating, “Death is not a problem.”The controversy comes after the project was exploited in May, causing its token to plummet 99% in a matter of hours. Since then, Normie has been working to regain trust by refunding those affected and relaunching a token with bolstered security.With the relaunch underway, the Twitter account has been posting promotional videos. Previous posts were generally met with positivity as the project attempted to recover from its exploit. But this time, it apparently went too far.Crypto Twitter went into uproar, with users suggesting that "Normie encourages suicide" or that traders should "send this atrocity to zero once and for all" due to "disgusting content.” Well-known crypto influencer Ansem simply replied, “Jesus Christ.” Ultimately, the project deleted the tweet with the video.“We have decided to remove our last video,” a Twitter post explained. “It was never our intention to trivialize a sensitive topic.”Instead, the post claims that the video aimed to explain that there is always a way out despite the brutal depiction of suicide. “The intern that posted it has been fired,” the post noted, though the concept of an intern being fired after a poorly received tweet has become something of a meme in the crypto space.Decrypt reached out to the Normie team for additional comment and clarification on that point, but did not immediately receive a response.That move received mixed responses from traders. In particular, some members of the community griped that an intern was purportedly fired for the post, as they believed others were responsible for what unfolded. Some speculated that the intern firing was just a joke, given the meme.Like most meme coins, NORMIE trading has been highly volatile over the past 24 hours, with the price rising and falling—but it's now down 16% over the past 24 hours at a current price of about $0.033.Edited by Andrew HaywardDaily Debrief NewsletterStart every day with the top news stories right now, plus original features, a podcast, videos and more.

Shiba Inu (SHIB) Team With Major Warning to its Community: Details


																TL;DR

Shibarmy Scam Alerts warned about fraudulent websites targeting Shiba Inu users, urging verification of site legitimacy.
The Shiba Inu team previously cautioned about fake Dapps and deceptive offers, emphasizing double-checking URLs and avoiding suspicious links.


The Latest Alert
The X account focused on treats surrounding Shiba Inu and its native token SHIB – Shibarmy Scam Alerts – issued a stark warning to the community. The team claimed that multiple fraudulent websites have spread across the crypto space, posing substantial risks to people. Those websites were described as “a scam designed to steal your funds:” 
“There is no website you need to connect your wallet to so it can sync up with the network, refresh your rewards, fix any issues you may be having with liquidity pools.”
The team advised users to stay focused and always verify the legitimacy of a certain website before connecting their wallets. Using only official links from trusted sources was also labeled a top priority. 
Shiba Inu is one of the most popular meme coins and among the trendiest cryptocurrencies, which could explain why scammers target people from its community. The latest data shows that there are almost 1.4 million SHIB holders, with over 58% currently sitting on paper profits. The percentage was even higher a few weeks ago when the meme coin was at a better price condition.
As of the moment, SHIB is worth approximately $0.00002314 (per CoinGecko’s data), a 9% decline on a 14-day scale.




SHIB Price, Source: CoinGecko
Previous Warnings
This is not the first time the Shiba Inu team cautions the community about potential dangers. Last year, Shibarmy Scam Alerts argued that scammers are “crafty” and can create decentralized applications (Dapps) that look nearly identical to legitimate platforms related to Shiba Inu (SHIB), Bone ShibaSwap (BONE), Doge Killer (LEASH), and other memecoins.  
“Always double-check the name and URL of the Dapp to make sure you’re using the official and trusted version,” they added.
The team also claimed that “sneaky” fraudsters pretend to represent “reputable projects or services,” thus luring people into sharing personal data and later becoming victims. As such, verifying the authenticity of each account and Dapp is of utmost importance. 
Earlier this year, Shibarium’s Marketing Strategist, using the X handle LUCIE, advised the community to take any suspicious links from prominent individuals or entities “announcing unexpected rewards” with a grain of salt. The SHIB official believes those offerings most likely come from hacked accounts, saying people should refrain from connecting their wallets to dubious websites.

Nvidia's Rumored GPU Upgrades Will Fuel More Demanding AI Tools - Decrypt

Nvidia is reportedly preparing a significant upgrade to its lineup of laptop GPUs. The forthcoming RTX 50 series, codenamed "GN22," will feature six different variants, surpassing the five options offered in the current RTX 40 series, according to an apparent leak shared by security researcher Dominic Alvieri.If accurate, the most notable enhancement in the updated specifications is the increase in video random-access memory (VRAM). The baseline for the RTX 50 series will be 8GB of VRAM, a step up from the 6GB baseline in its current laptop GPUs.The lineup will reportedly include three models with 8GB of VRAM, two with a robust 16GB, and one with 12GB.This boost in VRAM will enable the new GPUs to run more artificial intelligence (AI) models, which often require substantial memory resources. For example, Stable Diffusion 1.5 requires at least 4GB of VRAM to run properly. SDXL requires at least 6GB to be able to run.When Stability AI previewed its forthcoming SD3 model, which will be much more capable and powerful, it used GPUs with 24GB of VRAM. Fortunately, different versions will be available, with 800 million to 8 billion parameters, and different configurations—such as excluding its 4.7 billion parameter T5 text encoder—will not be so demanding.The RTX 50 series will also leverage faster GDDR7 memory, according to the leak, further improving the performance of AI-related tasks and gaming.The leaked roadmap suggests that Nvidia plans to continue producing some older GPUs, such as the RTX 4050 and RTX 3050, with 4GB and 6GB of VRAM to meet the market's need for cheaper hardware. For gaming, 6GB cards are still solid options, as VRAM is not as important as the clock speeds and the number of processors or cores.These GPUs will reportedly be released in 2025, although no specific timeline was provided. There have been conflicting rumors, but a CES 2025 unveiling is possible.Buyers looking for cheap cards may have their days numbered, however. Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC), Nvidia's main chip supplier, is said to be considering a price hike as its own expenses grow."We expect our customers to share some of the higher cost with us, and we already started our discussion with our customers," Wei said, according to Nikkei Asia.The report said Wei recently referred to Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang as the "three trillion guy," referencing Nvidia's soaring market value, which surpassed $3 trillion last week.TSMC produces an estimated 90% of the world's most advanced processor chips and is a vital player in Nvidia’s success.Despite the potential for increased production costs, Huang expressed his support for TSMC's arguments, saying that raising prices is “consistent with the value that they deliver,” Nikkei Asia reported.Morgan Stanley analysts have suggested that if Nvidia accepts a price hike from TSMC, other key AI players may follow and raise their prices. They estimate that Nvidia will account for 10% of TSMC's revenue this year.Generally Intelligent NewsletterA weekly AI journey narrated by Gen, a generative AI model.

Crypto is the âideal ecosystemâ for Argentina, says Num Finance exec - Crypto Briefing


            
            
                            
            
                            
            
            A few Latin American countries are among the top 20 when it comes to crypto adoption, according to Chainalysis’ “Geography of Cryptocurrency Report.” The report points out that the most popular use cases in the region are international remittances and protection against inflation, the latter being especially seen in Argentina, where inflation surpassed three digits last year.Agustin Liserra, CEO of Argentinian crypto firm Num Finance, explained that Latin Americans need a tool for permissionless worldwide transactions, while also mitigating inflation and currency devaluation.
“These are things that people really suffer here in Argentina and in Latin America in general. I would also say that here in Argentina, with Milei’s government, inflation is decreasing rapidly. So we are below the one-digit inflation per month, and it is important to be clear on that because it doesn’t seem like a real success, but for Argentina, where last year the inflation was higher than 100%, to have annualized inflation in the month for maybe 50% or 60%, it is like an improvement,” said Liserra.
Despite the signs of recovery seen through the shrinking inflation numbers, Liserra highlights that consumption and economic activity as a whole are decreasing in Argentina. Moreover, some products are not available in the country, and crypto becomes the ideal ecosystem for “this kind of need.” Num Finance offers a tokenized version of traditional finance products, such as commodities, stocks, and currency-backed stablecoins. Furthermore, they offer income products based on these stablecoins. Liserra explained that the focus on these products is related to their liquidity and the regulation around their markets, keeping customers protected.
“And then when talking about mitigating the inflation with high yield products, for example, what we are doing with Num seems to be really useful for people to have a stablecoin of the national currencies, such as the Argentinian peso, with a really high yield compared to inflation, and a tool that helps to mitigate that […] We believe that we in crypto still have a lot of room for growth in the financial real-world side, so we are focused on that.”
On the regulation side, Liserra underscored that no significant developments were made in Argentina after Milei became head of the executive power. However, a regulatory bill might come to light next year.“There is no still regulation regarding obligations to inform the regulator about the operations the clients are carrying out with certain exchanges or things like this, but only a registry to let the regulator know who the players in the ecosystem are. And then the idea is to start working with the government and to elaborate a digital asset service provider regulation. I don’t think this regulation is seeing light this year, maybe the next one.”

Bitcoin NFT sales surge, flips Ethereum: A sign of BTC season? - AMBCrypto



Interest in Bitcoin NFTs grew as weekly sales surged.
Activity on the Bitcoin network continued to decline.

Ethereum [ETH] had been the undisputed champion in the NFT sector for quite some time. However, in the last few months, Bitcoin [BTC] managed to dethrone Ethereum and claimed the top spot.
NFTs makes a comeback
Bitcoin took the lead in NFT sales, experiencing a significant 55.42% increase, bringing its total sales to a staggering $49.74 million.
However, this surge came with a caveat. Wash trading, a practice of inflating trading volume through artificial buying and selling, also rose by 15.39%, exceeding $39,000.
This can cause concerns and questions about the legitimacy of some of this activity.
Interestingly, despite the wash trading increase, the number of active buyers on Bitcoin plummeted by nearly 96%, with only 2,056 addresses participating in the market.
Ethereum, the previous leader, followed closely behind with $35 million in NFT sales. This represented a slight decline of 0.31% compared to the prior week.
However, unlike Bitcoin, Ethereum saw a higher number of active buyers engaging in the market, even though this number still reflected a significant 56.33% drop from the previous week.
Meanwhile, alternative blockchains were making strides as well. Polygon enjoyed a healthy 29.43% increase in sales, reaching $19.63 million.
Solana also witnessed growth, claiming the fourth position with $18.225 million in sales. Immutable X joined the party with a 12.77% increase in sales, further solidifying its presence in the NFT ecosystem.

One of the more popular collections on the Bitcoin network was Quantum Cats. Over the past month, the NFT collection witnessed a 51% uptick in sales volume.
Moreover, the sales transactions for this collection also grew significantly by 33% during this period.
Source: CryptoSlam
Activity on the network
Despite the high interest in Bitcoin NFTs, the number of active addresses on the Bitcoin network fell materially. AMBCrypto’s analysis of Santiment’s data indicated that the daily active addresses on the Bitcoin network fell from 1.17 million 613,000 in the last 30 days.
The waning activity on the network impacts miners as well and affects their ability to generate revenue based on transactions on the network.

Due to this miners can be forced to sell their holdings to remain profitable, causing selling pressure on BTC. However, the recent interest in BTC from whales can help BTC shake off the selling pressure.

Shiba Inu Community Targeted By Wallet Scam, Don’t Fall Victim | Bitcoinist.com


								The Shiba Inu team has cautioned against a new scam attack targeting community members. These malicious attackers have executed a sophisticated wallet scam that threatens to drain the funds of unsuspecting SHIB investors.   
New Scam Attack Targets SHIB Investors
Shibarmy Scam Alerts, an X (formerly Twitter) account dedicated to exposing scams within the SHIB community, has issued an urgent warning about a new wallet scam targeting SHIB token holders. On June 8, the scam tracker disclosed that a new wave of fraudulent websites is spreading across the crypto space. Most of these malicious sites are typically distributed within different social media platforms such as X, discord, telegram and more. 

According to Shibarmy Scam Alerts, these scam sites pose a significant risk to their investors and users, aiming to trick community members into compromising their wallets by using fake wallet connection tools. These malicious attackers lure unsuspecting Shiba Inu investors by claiming that they need to connect their wallet accounts to collect rewards or resolve technical issues involved with liquidity pools. 
The wallet connection tools also deceive SHIB holders into thinking that connecting their wallets via certain links is necessary for syncing with the Shiba Inu network. It’s important to note that these claims are entirely false and intended to steal users’ assets by jeopardizing their crypto wallet security.
The Shiba Inu community is one of the many cryptocurrency communities that are facing major challenges with scam attacks. The team has stayed dedicated to informing its investors and users of these scam attacks to protect them from financial loss and privacy risks. 
Just a few days ago, Shibarmy Scam Alerts disclosed malicious scammers impersonating official Shiba ecosystem accounts via fake Telegram accounts. The scam tracker also unveiled other attacks involving fake airdrops, fraudulent Shib reward distribution programs and multiple impersonators. 
Shiba Inu Scam Protection Tactics
The Shiba Inu team is committed to spreading awareness of scam attacks targeting its community, ensuring that its investors and users can remain safe within its ecosystem. In this regard, Shibarmy Scam Alerts has disclosed several ways SHIB community members can protect themselves against scam attempts in the community.

The team emphasized the importance of verifying the legitimacy of a website before engaging it or connecting wallets to it. This may be tricky, as scammers often create eerily convincing but fake websites designed to make wallet security vulnerable and steal funds. 
Additionally, Shibarmy scam alerts disclosed that users should endeavor to use official links from trusted sources and avoid clicking links from unverified sites. The team has stressed the need for vigilance to combat these scam attacks, emphasizing that community members remain updated on these scams and share information with fellow SHIBArmy members to help prevent potential financial loss. 
The members are also encouraged to double-check before connecting their wallets to any sites while also collectively adhering to the best security practices to reduce the chances of falling victim to scam attackers.

Apple Taps OpenAI to Bring Big AI Updates to iPhones and Macs - Decrypt

Apple is bringing ChatGPT to Siri, the company announced during its annual WWDC conference on Monday. Apple confirmed a long-rumored partnership with OpenAI as a key part of its new “Apple Intelligence” upgrades coming to iOS 18, MacOS 18, and macOS Sequoia. It represents the biggest overhaul to Apple's digital assistant since it was introduced in 2011.Apple users will be able to use OpenAI’s leading toolset, including its latest ChatGPT-4o AI model, across their Apple devices—but Siri will ask for permission, first.“We built support into Siri, so Siri can tap into ChatGPT’s expertise when it might be helpful for you,” Apple Senior Vice President of Software Engineering Craig Federighi said during the presentation. “You will be able to access ChatGPT for free without creating an account, and your request and information will not be logged.”“For ChatGPT subscribers, you'll be able to connect your account and access paid features right within our experiences,” he added.Speculation around Apple’s generative AI ambitions has steadily increased since their iPad Event in May, leading up to WWDC, including rumors of an OpenAI partnership. Anticipation of the Apple AI push at WWDC pushed the company's stock price near an all-time high, reaching $195 early Monday.“We're excited to partner with Apple to bring ChatGPT to their users in a new way,” OpenAI CEO Sam Altman said in a separate announcement. “Apple shares our commitment to safety and innovation, and this partnership aligns with OpenAI's mission to make advanced AI accessible to everyone.”The new AI integrations will launch later this year, Apple said, and will be available on the iPhone 15 or later models and computers using Apple proprietary processor chips.Apple also showed off new ways AI will be added throughout its systems, such as image generation and editing, audio transcription, text summarization and writing assistance across apps, personalized emoji creation, and dozens of new photo and video features. And to deliver these upgrades, the company said its AI features will rely on private cloud computing.“These models run on servers we've especially created using Apple silicon,” Federighi said. “These Apple silicon servers offer the privacy and security of your iPhone from the silicon on up, draw on the security properties of the Swift programming language, and run software with transparency built in.”The encryption setup ensures that iPhones, iPads, and Macs will refuse to talk to a server unless its software has been publicly logged for inspection, he explained.“This sets a brand new standard for privacy and AI and unlocks intelligence you can trust,” Federighi said.Although Apple has taken steps to support AI development on its hardware and released open-source AI models, it is relatively late in openly embracing generative AI for its massively popular products and services, following wide-ranging AI-powered product releases from Microsoft, Google, and Amazon.Not all new AI announcements have been greeted warmly, however. Microsoft unveiled a new “Recall” feature that allowed users to find anything they've done on their computers in part through indexing snapshots of users' screens. After backlash, Microsoft reversed course.“Built in a uniquely Apple way, we think ‘Apple Intelligence’ is going to be indispensable to the products that already play such an integral role in our lives,” Apple CEO Tim Cook said.Wall Street was not especially impressed by the day's announcements, however, with Apple stock closing slightly down for the day priced at $193.Edited by Ryan Ozawa.Generally Intelligent NewsletterA weekly AI journey narrated by Gen, a generative AI model.

Bitcoin Economist Reveals Year-End Forecast for BTC Price - Bitcoin Sistemi

Economist Timothy Peterson suggested in a recent analysis that Bitcoin's difficulty growth rate points to a potential increase in BTC price to $100,000 by the end of the year.
Bitcoin's difficulty rating, a measure of how difficult it is to mine a new block on the blockchain, is adjusted every two weeks to ensure blocks are added approximately every 10 minutes. While this metric increases with more miners and computing power, it decreases when miners leave. Bitcoin's decentralized nature and automatic, transparent difficulty adjustments prevent any entity from manipulating it.


According to Peterson, Bitcoin's difficulty is closely related to its price. As difficulty increases, the energy cost per Bitcoin mined also increases, forcing miners to balance electricity and hardware expenses against potential rewards. High Bitcoin prices make these costs reasonable, making mining profitable even as the difficulty increases. Conversely, a price drop may force some miners to exit, reducing computational power and difficulty.

According to Peterson, there is a feedback loop between Bitcoin price and difficulty. Higher prices increase difficulty by attracting more miners, which can support higher prices. Conversely, higher difficulty and associated costs drive miners to increase efficiency and support higher prices as the network becomes stronger. The market strives for an equilibrium where energy costs are balanced by the price of Bitcoin.





Given these dynamics and current trends, Peterson predicts a reasonable year-end range for Bitcoin price will be $60,000 to $90,000. A high difficulty level indicates robust network security that supports higher prices, while energy costs also provide a price floor. However, the potential for increased adoption and positive market sentiment could push the price even higher, towards $100,000.

Get Started with Wasabi on Blast | Bankless


One of the hotter apps in the Blast L2 scene right now is Wasabi, a leverage trading protocol for long-tail assets like memecoins and NFTs.In other words, you can use Wasabi’s perpetual futures, which have no expiry, to long or short tokens that many other derivatives protocols don’t support. The idea? Trade culture, on leverage.Of course, if you’re not a derivatives veteran, leverage should be handled with care. But whether you’re interested in just dabbling or diving head-on into perps, Wasabi is particularly interesting for a few reasons:📈 Slick UX — I’ve seen my fair share of derivatives protocols since DeFi Summer in 2020, and Wasabi is arguably one of the simplest to navigate🪂 Wasabi SZN 2 — Using the project now ahead of the end of Wasabi Points Season 2 will make you eligible for an upcoming reward distribution, presumably the main Wasabi airdrop🪙 Blast Gold — Blast is conducting its much-anticipated airdrop on June 26th, and Wasabi still has over 150k Gold to distribute to its users between now and then; remember, 50% of the Blast airdrop goes to Gold holdersvia https://blast.io/en/airdrop?tab=DappAirdropsThe primary ways to use Wasabi are 1) by providing liquidity to Wasabi Vaults or 2) by trading Wasabi Perps. Let’s briefly walk through the basics of each of these offerings below. Depositing Into Wasabi Vaultsvia https://blast.wasabi.xyz/vaults?vault=Wasabi Vaults allow users to provide liquidity and earn rewards. Here’s how you can get started:Choose a Vault: Select from a range of vaults that support different Blast-centric assets. The most popular choices are the WETH and USDB Vaults, which are currently yielding 3.56% and 16.01% APR respectively. Deposit assets: Use the provided interface to deposit your desired amount of tokens into the vault. These assets will then be used to facilitate perps trades on the platform.Earn rewards: Earn a share of the trading fees and potentially other incentives like Wasabi Points or Blast Gold for the service of providing liquidity over time. Trading Wasabi Perpsvia https://blast.wasabi.xyz/?side=shortWasabi Perps allow you to take leveraged positions on a variety of Blast tokens. Here’s a quick guide:Select a pair: Choose the token pair you want to trade.Set leverage: Use the provided interface to decide on the size of your position in ETH and the level of leverage you want to use. Remember, higher leverage means higher risk.Enter a position: Go long (bet on the price going up) or short (bet on the price going down) on your chosen pair by pressing the “Open Position” button and completing the ensuing transaction with your wallet.Manage your trade: Monitor your position over time and close it with a transaction once it has risen or fallen enough for your taste. If you do try these perps, be sure to watch out for the liquidation price, which will automatically close your position if it’s reached. The liquidation price is shown in Wasabi’s “Active Positions” dashboard, so you can try to frontrun it to recoup some of your ETH if your position is sliding into the red and you want to abort.  Zooming OutIf you’re new to leverage trading, start with a small position to get a feel for how Wasabi works, and only play with money you can afford to lose. Also, keep an eye on the latest updates from Wasabi and Blast to stay on top of any further announcements around rewards in the coming weeks! Lastly, if you’re on the outside looking in and need to bridge funds into Blast, I recommend Relay’s fast bridge or Swaps feature for being user-friendly.

“It’s the Last Chance To Buy Altcoins Super Cheap”, Says Crypto Expert | Cryptoglobe


                                
Michaël van de Poppe, a well-known cryptocurrency analyst and trader, is based at the Amsterdam Stock Exchange and frequently shares his insights on various social media platforms, particularly X (formerly known as Twitter). 



On 10 June 2024, Van de Poppe posted a detailed analysis on X, emphasizing that this could be the last chance to buy altcoins at super cheap prices. He noted that despite a strange bull market where Solana has performed exceptionally well and Bitcoin has rallied to an all-time high pre-halving and after the U.S. launch of spot Bitcoin ETFs, altcoins have remained silent.



Van de Poppe suggested that a reversal for altcoins is very likely on the horizon. He mentioned in his videos from the previous week that he had swapped his coins towards newer ones and went all-in on altcoins over a month ago. Van de Poppe stated that his strategy has not changed and encouraged his followers to check out his recent YouTube video for more details on his strategy.



He argued that this is the right period to take more risks with everything happening globally. The crypto analyst pointed out that the European Central Bank (ECB) had announced a rate cut, which likely indicates that the Federal Reserve (FED) in the US will do the same in the coming months, potentially leading to increased liquidity as quantitative easing is initiated.



Furthermore, Van de Poppe highlighted that spot Ethereum ETF has been approved but not yet listed. He explained that the current situation is a vacuum with no price action because the 19B-4 forms have been approved, but the S-1 forms have not. He drew a parallel to the spot Bitcoin ETF approvals, which did not provide positive price action initially but led to a significant upward run once trading started on the exchanges.



Van de Poppe argued that the current market situation is comparable to January of this year, noting that altcoins have provided terrible returns recently. He predicted that once spot Ethereum ETF start trading in the U.S., likely later this month or early July, it will be a “sell the rumor, buy the news” event for the markets, with altcoins expected to rotate upwards.







            
            

            
            

            
            

        

He believes the U.S. SEC’s approval of spot Ethereum ETFs is a significant confirmation for the entire blockchain and crypto ecosystem, potentially classifying many projects within the Ethereum ecosystem as commodities, thus increasing their potential. Van de Poppe emphasized that most venture capital investments are directed towards the Ethereum ecosystem, which could lead to a market repricing based on the current information.



Reflecting on past events, van de Poppe noted that the spot Bitcoin ETFs’ initial trading marked the peak of altcoins in their Bitcoin valuations, after which altcoins suffered significant losses. He suggested that the start of trading of US-listed spot Ethereum ETFs could mark the reversal of this trend, serving as a confirmation that altcoins exist alongside Bitcoin.



The analyst pointed out that Bitcoin is at an all-time high, while Ethereum and other altcoins are significantly below their 2021 highs. He argued that spot Ethereum ETFs will likely attract substantial liquidity to the Ethereum blockchain from institutional investors, reigniting interest in the ecosystem.



He revealed that his portfolio is heavily invested in the Ethereum ecosystem, based on fundamental research and high-conviction tokens. Van de Poppe stressed his transparency in sharing his buying and accumulating strategies.



He concluded by addressing the recent hype around other assets like BRC-20 and AI, expressing his preference for focusing on undervalued assets. Van de Poppe acknowledged his past mistakes but remained confident in his investment approach, emphasizing his willingness to take risks in his portfolio.

Loopring's ‘Most Secure’ Smart Wallet Breached For $5 Million - The Defiant

The attacker managed to compromise Loopring’s 2FA service.Loopring, an Ethereum Layer 2 network, reported a security breach on Sunday that resulted in the loss of $5 million worth of tokens.Hackers exploited Smart Wallets which relied on a single Guardian, specifically targeting the Loopring Official Guardian.“The attack succeeded by compromising Loopring's 2FA service, allowing the hacker to impersonate the wallet owner and gain approval for the Recovery from the Official Guardian,” Loopring tweeted. “Subsequently, the attacker transferred assets out of the affected wallets.”Loopring describes its Smart Wallet as the "most secure Ethereum wallet," which supports social recovery, multi-signature security, and integration with Layer 2 solutions.The Guardian service allows users to designate trusted wallets for security actions such as locking compromised wallets or restoring access if the seed phrase is lost. In this breach, the hacker bypassed the official Guardian service and was able to impersonate wallet owners to initiate recovery processes.In response to the attack, the company said it has temporarily suspended all Guardian-related and 2FA-related operations to prevent further breaches.Loopring has also shared two wallet addresses that it claims were used in the attack. Blockchain data reveals that one of these wallets drained around 1,373 ETH, worth $5 million.Loopring's native token, LRC, dropped 2% on the news.Surge in Smart Wallet AdoptionSmart Wallets have been gaining traction after ERC-4337 enabled account abstraction on the Ethereum mainnet. The update allows users to customize their wallets for specific needs, including automated transactions, multi-signature wallets, and social recovery.Introduced in September 2021 by Vitalik Buterin, ERC-4337 has brought new Smart Wallet capabilities. Buterin promoted features like "social recovery," which eliminates recovery phrases.Before ERC-4337, some companies had already pioneered their own smart wallet functionalities. Loopring and Argent, for instance, developed their own Smart Wallets back in 2020. More recently, Coinbase launched its Smart Wallet.While Smart Wallets improve functionality and provide a better user experience (UX), they also come with new risks and attack vectors that traditional externally owned accounts (EOA) wallets don't face.In April, when EIP-3074 was approved for inclusion in Ethereum's next major upgrade, Pectra, several key figures in the Ethereum community warned that these capabilities could make wallets more vulnerable to scams.“It should allow a scammer to drain your entire wallet with a single off-chain signature,” warned Itamar Lesuisse, the co-founder of Argent, a Starknet wallet provider. “I expect this will be a major use case.”

Moody's Makes Statement on Likelihood of a FED Rate Cut - Bitcoin Sistemi

Moody's Analytics Chief Economist Mark Zandi said in a recent interview that he believes the Fed should consider lowering interest rates, arguing that the central bank has achieved its economic goals.
Zandi's comments came amid ongoing debate about the FED's current policy stance. “I think they achieved their goal,” Zandi said, adding: “We are at full employment. The unemployment rate increased slightly last year to 4%, which is consistent with a full employment economy.”


According to Zandi, inflation has been running at the Fed's target of 2% for the past six to twelve months, excluding landlords' imputed rents. Zandi questioned the need to maintain the current high rate of 5.5%, arguing that the economy may not need such a restrictive monetary policy.
“The equilibrium rate, which is the rate that neither promotes nor constrains growth, is higher than it has been historically for a variety of reasons, but it is not 5.5%,” Zandi said. Warning that maintaining high interest rates could risk economic stability, Zandi said, “As long as the FED keeps its hand on the neck of the economy, it risks breaking something.”





During the discussion, CNBC's Sarah Eisen noted that the Fed's target is relying on the Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) index, which has not yet reached the desired 2% level. Zandi acknowledged this, but said the trend was moving in the right direction, pointing out that the difference was largely due to the way the implicit cost of home ownership was measured.

Eisen expressed concern about the potential for inflation to reignite, especially given the strong employment and wage growth figures recently announced. Zandi countered by attributing the strong employment numbers to higher immigration and noting signs of a softening labor market, including higher unemployment and hiring rates compared to the previous year, layoffs, unfilled positions, temporary jobs and declines in hours worked.


Despite the strong job market, Zandi believes fundamental data does not point to an impending economic momentum. “Year-on-year inflation in CPI is 3%, meaning real growth is zero last year,” he said and added: “This does not show that things are accelerating.”
Asked whether the Fed's current policy is misguided, Zandi expressed concern that delaying rate cuts until September could have more significant economic repercussions. While he acknowledged that the economy was resilient and could avoid a hard landing, he argued that the risks of policy failure were increasing.





“The most likely scenario is that they pull it off and the economy has a soft landing,” Zandi said. “But the risk of making a mistake here also increases. The question is: Why would they take that risk?”
