Bugs in Gains Network fork let traders profit 900% on every trade: Report

Two different bugs in a fork of the Gains Network leveraged trading protocol could have allowed traders to profit 900% on every trade, regardless of the price of the token traded, according to an April 19 report from blockchain security firm Zellic. One of the bugs existed in a previous version of Gains but was later patched. The other was only found in a fork of the protocol. According to Zellic, its staff informed the developers of Gains forks Gambit Trade, Holdstation Exchange, and Krav Trade of the vulnerability, and these development teams have ensured their protocols do not contain such two flaws. However, other Gains forks may still be vulnerable, Zellic warned.According to its official website, Gains Network is an ecosystem of decentralized finance (DeFi) products on Polygon and Arbitrum. The official name for its leveraged trading app is “gTrade.” It has facilitated over $25 billion in derivatives volume since its inception in May 2023, according to blockchain analytics platform DefiLlama.User interface for gTrade, the Gains Network leveraged trading app. Source: Gains NetworkZellic claimed that several popular DeFi trading apps are derived from Gains Network’s base code, including the aforementioned Gambit Trade and Holdstation, as well as many other protocols. They discovered the exploit while studying a particular fork but declined to name which one they discovered it in.According to the report, Gains Network contracts allow users to open either a market, reversal or momentum trade order. A market order buys or sells an asset immediately, regardless of price. When a user asks to open a momentum or reversal trade, the smart contract records an “order” that contains data about what price the user is willing to trade at. Once this price is reached, any user can call the executeLimitOrder function to fill the order. The user who calls the execution does not have to be the same one who placed the order. Users who call the execution get paid a small “execution fee” for performing this role. This allows users to place limit (momentum) and stop-limit (reversal) orders similar to the way they can in a centralized exchange, but without needing a centralized entity to perform the order fills.When a user places an order, they can set a take-profit price, stop-loss price or both. The intention of this design is to allow traders to automatically exit a profitable trade at the take-profit point or a losing trade at the stop-loss point. Bug in Gains fork allowed 900% profit on buy ordersIn the Gains fork it studied, Zellic discovered that when an order was opened, the stop-loss price became stored in the “currentPrice” variable used to calculate profit and loss. This meant that if a user was able to set the stop-loss above the open price, they could automatically profit from any trade. For example, consider a scenario where the price of Bitcoin (BTC) was $63,000 and the user entered $62,000 as the open price and $64,000 as the stop-loss. In this case, if the price fell to $62,000, the order would become filled. But the price would be immediately below its stop-loss, triggering an automatic exit.In addition, the stop-loss set by the user would be recorded as the current price. This meant that the user would profit $2,000, even though the correct profit should have been approximately $0. This could have allowed an attacker to profit from every trade and eventually drain the protocol of all of its funds.To prevent this exploit, the protocol contained a check that threw a “wrong_sl” error if the user attempted to set their stop-loss above their open price on a buy order.Gains Network fork check to prevent wrong take-profit or stop-loss. Source: ZellicHowever, the investigators discovered that this check could be bypassed in certain circumstances. When a user first opened an order, they set the price at which they wanted to open the trade, which was then recorded in the variable “openPrice.” It was at this point that the check was performed. However, the function used to execute an order changed this variable to the value of “a.Price,” which was the current price plus the price impact from the order being opened. This meant that if the user entered an extremely high open price, an executor could bypass the check by simply executing the order. This also allowed the executor to fill the order at an open price below what it was originally set to. As an example, Zellic considered the idea of an attacker who places an order to buy a token at $100000e10 ($1 quadrillion) and sets a stop-loss at $1 less than this or $999.999999999999 trillion. Once the order is placed, the attacker then executes their own order, causing openPrice to change from $100000e10 to whatever the current price is after the trade’s price impact is taken into account. The trade then executes and becomes open. As long as the resulting opening price is below the stop-loss that was originally set, it can now be closed by executing the stop-loss. When the attacker executes their own stop-loss, they profits from the difference between the closing price and the price of the stop-loss.The trade would have resulted in a 900% profit for the attacker, Zellic claimed.Gains fork exploit example. Source: ZellicThis flaw was not present in Gains Network at the time the Zellic team discovered it. It only existed in the forked version it was investigating. However, in the process of studying this issue, it ran across a second flaw that was present in an earlier version of Gains itself.Second bug allowed 900% profit on sell ordersThe second bug allowed traders to profit 900% on sell orders regardless of price action.When a trade was closed in the Gains fork, it converted the user’s stop-loss or take-profit point into a variable called “int,” which it then used to calculate profit in percentage terms. But if a user entered a stop-loss or take-profit value that was exactly 2^256-1, the resulting calculations would have caused “int” to become negative. This was because 2^256-1 is the max value for positive numbers in Ethereum, causing any value above it to “overflow” or start over at zero and because the calculation added the open price to its total. In the Solidity programming language, 2^256-1 is also known as “type(uint256).max.” According to Zellic, as long as an attacker used leverage of greater than 9x, they could profit 900% from this exploit:“Let’s consider a sell order, with currentPrice as type(uint256).max. The resultant value of diff would be openPrice + 1 (int(type(uint256).max) = -1 ), and hence the profit percent would be nearly equal to 100 * leverage. Therefore, if the leverage is greater than 9, the function will return the profit as 900%.”There was a check in the contract that attempted to prevent 2^256-1 from being entered as a take-profit. However, this check was only performed at the moment the order was first opened. If the user changed their take-profit point after the order was opened, they could bypass the check and enter 2^256-1 as the take-profit, allowing them to gain an automatic 900% profit each time they traded.This second flaw did exist in a previous version of Gains but was subsequently patched. The current version does not contain this flaw, as it performs the check when the take-profit and stop-loss are updated as well as when they are first set.Zellic reportedly informed all of the above forks about these two security flaws and contacted the Crypto Security Alliance in an attempt to find other protocols that may be affected by them. However, it warned that some Gains forks may still contain these bugs, putting users’ funds at risk of being drained.Cointelegraph contacted Gains Network, Gambit Trade, Holdstation Exchange, and Krav Trade for comment but did not receive a response by the time of publication.Gains Network claims that it provides the “real spot price” of listed assets, as opposed to what it sees as less accurate prices based on perpetual contracts. It also claims to offer superior forex trading compared to competitors.Related: Libra-related Sui blockchain fixes critical bug that put ‘billions’ at risk

Playing Fantasy on Blast | Bankless


What do you get when you cross Crypto Twitter (CT) with NFTs, fantasy sports, and Blast farming season?Fantasy.top.Fantasy is a social trading card game (TCG) on the Blast L2 centered around collecting, trading, and competing with digital cards representing the most popular CT influencers. It’s become a sensation fast, too, as the game has already racked up nearly 30k users and +9,000 ETH worth of trading volume since its May 1st, 2024 launch. via hildobbyThe big idea? Join tournaments with 5-card decks, with Twitter engagement metrics determining the final winner. Banger posts from “Hero” accounts on Twitter translate to more points for holders of that influencer on Fantasy. via BREADCards can be purchased in VRGDA auctions, which rise and fall with demand, or on Fantasy’s native secondary marketplace, where players can list and buy Heroes to manage and improve their decks. via FantasyHeroes cards come in four different rarities—Common, Rare, Epic, and Legendary—with each tier granting 1x, 1.5x, 2x, and 2.5x score multipliers respectively. Additionally, every Hero has a unique score and rank based on their engagement over the past week, and you can burn 5 of a kind if you want to increase a card’s tier for better scores. via BREADWith at least 5 cards in hand, you’ll be ready to enter tournaments, with the first two already having distributed over $4M worth of prize money to Heroes and players. Tournaments are conducted across 5 possible leagues, and the first batch of players just progressed to the Silver League, paving the way for them to earn higher rewards. This brings us ‘round to the question of why the game has taken off so fast, to which I think there are a handful of reasons:Farming for Blast Points and Blast GOLD is in full swing, so people are hungry for trying new Blast appsCT degens love gaming and gambling, and this is a gamified avenue to gamble on each other, which has created a layer of social intrigueHeroes receive game revenue payouts in ETH, Blast GOLD, and FAN points, offering a novel monetization avenue for something they would already be doing anyways, i.e. posting on TwitterMore than a few early players have already made considerable gains, both via flipping cards and tournament rewards, and players can also use their Heroes NFTs to enter win Blast Jackpot prizesTaken altogether, these factors suggest Fantasy has plenty of room to run for the foreseeable future as more people flock to the buzz and possibilities here. That said, going forward it’ll be key for the platform to lock down its anti-botting strategy to keep tournaments fair and to continue rolling out new advances to polish up the player experience. If it can achieve these pillars, Fantasy’s near-term prospects will continue looking good. If you’re keen to try the game, sign up with your Twitter account on fantasy.top to receive an embedded Privy wallet that you can deposit into (or export into MetaMask, etc., for entering your cards for Blast Jackpots). To move ETH in, I recommend Relay by Reservoir for quick transfers to Blast.All in all, Fantasy certainly won’t be for everyone, but if you’re looking to dive into the Blast NFT scene and potentially reap rewards, it's a top contender to check out right now. My suggestion? Analyze available Heroes, buy cheap floor cards, and try steadily grinding up to better scores!

EU securities watchdog to review crypto eligibility for UCITS investments

The European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA) has initiated a review of the rules governing crypto asset investments by UCITS (Undertakings for Collective Investment in Transferable Securities) as part of a broader examination of the EU’s financial regulatory framework.The review comes in response to a request from the European Commission (EC) to ensure that UCITS rules keep pace with rapid market developments, including the burgeoning crypto sector.Reevaluating asset inclusionSince the implementation of the UCITS Eligible Assets Directive in 2007, the landscape of financial instruments has expanded significantly, necessitating a reevaluation of what assets should be accessible for UCITS funds.These funds are known for their high level of investor protection and are a popular choice among retail and institutional investors across Europe and globally.The current regulatory framework defines the criteria for assets that UCITS can invest in, with the aim of ensuring liquidity and risk diversification.However, the rise of digital assets like cryptocurrencies has presented new challenges and opportunities that the existing directives do not specifically address. Digital assets, known for their high volatility and emerging market trends, pose unique risks and potential rewards for investors that need to be regulated appropriately.Notably, UCITS funds typically revolve around securities, and including crypto could imply that digital assets would be regulated as such in the EU. The watchdog has yet to clarify its stance on the matter.Consultation processESMA’s call for evidence seeks input from stakeholders on how to adapt the UCITS framework to include digital assets, focusing on direct and indirect exposures. The agency is particularly interested in understanding the implications of allowing UCITS to invest in crypto — both in terms of investor protection and market stability.The consultation process, open until Aug. 7, will gather feedback from investment firms, consumer advocacy groups, and other financial entities.ESMA will consider these responses in preparing its technical advice to the Commission, which is expected to address whether and how the scope of eligible assets should be expanded to include crypto and other contemporary investment vehicles.As the financial markets continue to evolve, the outcome of this review could significantly impact the accessibility of crypto investments for European funds, potentially paving the way for greater integration of digital assets into mainstream financial portfolios.The findings will also influence how these assets are regulated, balancing innovation with investor protection in the rapidly changing landscape of global finance.

Consensys Lawsuit Over Ethereum Won’t Deter SEC, Former Regulator Says - Decrypt

A preemptive lawsuit filed in Texas federal court aims to definitively determine Ethereum’s regulatory status. But the move by blockchain software company Consensys in its home state may be far from the final legal showdown over crypto’s second-top coin, as the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has national reach.“The SEC can bring a case anywhere in the country,” Christopher Gerold, a partner at Lowenstein Sandler LLP told Decrypt. “They can just as easily file a lawsuit today and allege sale of unregistered securities in a jurisdiction that they find favorable: California, New York, [or Washington] D.C.”In its complaint, the MetaMask maker claimed the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has internally viewed Ethereum as a security for over a year. (Disclosure: Consensys is one of 22 investors in Decrypt.) Among other rulings related to MetaMask’s features, Consensys seeks a judicial declaration that Ethereum is not a security.Ethereum co-founder and Consensys CEO Joe Lubin said Thursday that the firms’ lawsuit is aimed at “getting clarity from U.S. courts.” But the legal tussle, despite being in Texas, probably won’t bring clarity about on its own, according to Gerold, who previously served as the chief of the New Jersey Bureau of Securities. “You have a lot of judges [in Texas] that are concerned about the expansion of federal agencies and the role they play,” Gerold said. “If you're anti-regulation [...], that's where you bring your case.”Consensys may have made a strategic choice in filing its lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Texas, where “judge shopping” has proved contentious. But that doesn’t preclude the SEC from picking its own favorable legal turf if it decides to move forward with a separate lawsuit, Gerold explained.If the SEC wanted to find that Ethereum was a security publicly, they don’t have to do it through the Consensys lawsuit, he continued. And depending on how higher courts rule as those cases are appealed, Ethereum could be considered a security in one part of the U.S. but not the other.“Something could be legal in New Jersey and illegal in Texas,” Gerold said, noting that federal circuit courts are not bound by the decisions of other federal circuit courts.A patchwork of case law could become cemented if the Supreme Court then decides not to take up the question of whether Ethereum is a security. Of course, Congress could step in at any moment with new laws that ultimately determine how digital assets are treated, Gerold said.The SEC has not filed any charges related to the Ethereum-centered investigation that Consensys alleges is occurring. And Gerold expects the agency will first seek to dismiss the case without telegraphing its internal thoughts on Ethereum’s legal status.A lawsuit from the SEC could then follow, which would build upon a Wells Notice issued to Consensys, as is usually the case, Gerold said. A Wells Notice from the SEC typically precedes formal charges. It could still be years until the regulatory matter over Ethereum is fully settled, coming to a head in several different courtrooms along the way.“There's different paths [that this] could go.” Gerold said. “But this idea that Consensys’ lawsuit is going to answer the question [of] whether Ethereum is a security or not—and that's the only forum that has that ability right now—is a fallacy.”Edited by Ryan Ozawa.Stay on top of crypto news, get daily updates in your inbox.

Joe Biden Is Trying to ‘Kill Crypto’, Says Cardano Creator - Decrypt

A fight over a non-binding resolution passed in the U.S. House has erupted into a broader battle, pitting the crypto industry against the Biden administration.“The Biden administration has engaged in a coordinated effort to kill crypto,” wrote Charles Hoskinson, creator of Cardano, on Twitter.Yesterday, the White House said U.S. Pres. Joe Biden would veto resolution H.J. Res. 109, which demanded that the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) retract a staff bulletin on digital asset custody accounting. The resolution won a bipartisan vote of 229-193, declaring that the SEC’s views were holding back American innovation in the digital asset space.Hoskinson declared the move only the latest in what he called "Operation Chokepoint 2.0."“This November, if you vote for Joe Biden as a cryptocurrency holder, please understand that the intent of this administration is to destroy the American cryptocurrency industry,” he said on a Twitter livestream late Wednesday. “Understand that. It’s unambiguously clear.”The White House argued that the resolution would hurt the SEC's efforts to protect investors in crypto markets and safeguard the broader financial system. But crypto enthusiasts don’t see it that way—and many believe that former president Donald Trump will be the better option in November's election."The [Trump] administration had its issues but mostly ignored our industry,” Hoskinson tweeted.“The enforcement is tone-deaf and continues to carry on the same policy, which has cost tens of thousands if not hundreds of thousands of American jobs as well as the loss of a trillion-dollar industry," Hoskinson said.“They have confiscated, lied, and repeatedly throughout the years hurt our industry in every way possible, whether it be restricting access to bank accounts, regulation through enforcement, anti clarity, in some cases reversing decisions that had already been made, and now obstructing the legislative process,” he continued. “Understand that a vote for Biden is a vote against cryptocurrencies.”Ryan Selkis, founder of Messari, also expressed concern about Biden’s position on crypto.“If Biden is reelected, they’ll hit stablecoins by requiring bank licenses for issuers, all tokens for being unregistered securities, all DeFi for unlicensed money transmission, Bitcoin mining, layers on top of BTC, and self-hosted wallets to collect crypto unrealized gains.”The CEO of Irreverent Labs, Rahul Sood, also expressed his disappointment, suggesting that voting for Biden is now even harder for those who care about crypto in the U.S."Wow—well, that settles it,” Sood tweeted. ”Thanks for making it easy, Joe."The Founder of Helium, Amir Haleem, echoed the sentiment. "Sad state of affairs,” he wrote on Twitter. “If you care about crypto in the US, voting for Biden is now even more impossible.”The document at the root of the dispute is a so-called Staff Accounting Bulletin (SAB), which SEC Chair Gary Gensler has said is uncontroversial."It basically addresses whether liabilities should be on the balance sheet, and what we have found actually in bankruptcy court, time and again, many times now, is that indeed, bankruptcy courts have said that crypto assets are not bankruptcy remote,” he said in December. “So, the staff, as they have done over 50 years, did really good work."But Gensler has many vocal critics on Capitol Hill.Republican Patrick McHenry accused him of wanting to “choke off” the crypto industry. Even the courts have criticized the SEC over its “arbitrary and capricious” decisions.Crypto holders may be growing in importance as a constituency worth courting by politicians. A recent study by the Blockchain Association found that 90% of all crypto holders plan to vote in the next election, with the majority worried that politicians may be stifling innovation via overregulation. 45% liked or self identified as Democrats, 43% as Republicans, and 11% identified as independent.Biden’s rival, Donal Trump is taking the opportunity to earn the adoration of concerned crypto holders.“Crypto is moving out of the U.S. because of hostility towards crypto,” Trump said during a special event in Florida yesterday. “Gensler is very much against it, the Democrats are very much against it, but I’m good with it.”This pro-crypto stance sharply contrasts with his previous statements back from when he was president of the United States. “I am not a fan of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, which are not money, and whose value is highly volatile and based on thin air,” Trump wrote on Twitter in 2019.Stay on top of crypto news, get daily updates in your inbox.

Meme coin traders can benefit from fundamental analysis, says HashKey Capital's Jupiter Zhang - Crypto Briefing




Meme coins registered 1,300% returns on average during the first quarter, according to a report by CoinGecko. This made meme coins the most profitable narrative in that period and made the number of tokens issued on Solana, the hottest blockchain for meme coin trading, reach an all-time high of 14,648 tokens launched.In this landscape, new investors might be tempted to spray their funds over different meme coins and hope for stellar growth. Jupiter Zhang, head of liquid funds at investment firm HashKey Capital, highlights that “for every success story there are dozens more failures.”“Market fundamentals have never been more important. […] FOMO is not a long-term strategy,” shared Zhang with Crypto Briefing. “Fundamental analysis provides a structured, analytical approach to investment, especially crucial in a volatile market like crypto. While the high returns from meme coins might seem attractive, they are often driven by hype and speculation rather than underlying economic value.”Recently, HashKey Capital published a 217-page book titled “Digital Asset Valuation Framework”, a guide to fundamental analysis in crypto. Zhang is the lead author, and he says that by understanding fundamental analysis, investors can identify assets with real potential and longevity, reducing risk and fostering a more sustainable investment strategy.“This is crucial because, as the meme coin narrative shows, not all that glitters in the crypto world is gold.”Why bother with fundamentals?Meme coins, as the name suggests, rise by backpacking on a famous meme. Because of this, most of them usually have short lifespans. Investors might not be inclined to learn how to do proper research since spreading money might be more profitable.“Even in the seemingly whimsical area of meme coins, fundamental analysis can provide insights. For instance, evaluating the community engagement, development activity, and use cases of the token can offer a glimpse into its potential sustainability and growth,” explains Zhang.Moreover, fundamental analysis can be useful for identifying what meme coins have a strong enough narrative to sustain longer-term interest from those that are likely to fizzle out with the fading of initial hype.“Fundamental analysis doesn’t necessarily lie in opposition to narrative-driven investing, which focuses primarily on the stories and trends that capture market interest and investor sentiment. They can be used in tandem to provide a more well-rounded evaluation of a digital asset’s potential.”Zhang adds that while fundamental analysis aims for long-term growth against the market’s often emotional and speculative waves, narrative-driven investments are useful to ride the waves of market enthusiasm and investor psychology, potentially reaping quick rewards.However, narrative-driven investing often leads to the fear of missing out (FOMO), and that usually ends in bad investments. In other words, narrative-driven demands an effort to time the market and move swiftly before the narrative shifts, while fundamental analysis delves into the intrinsic value of an investment, looking to identify assets with strong fundamentals that suggest a higher intrinsic value than the market price.“This is a more methodical path to potentially sustainable gains, as it requires rigorous assessment of data. Some things we look at when evaluating the fundamentals of digital assets: a thorough evaluation of a token’s utility, governance structure, supply mechanics, technical stack, and potential innovations there.”More VCs into meme coinsThe meme coin market was always a way for investors to bet without generating returns for VCs. That is because when a token from a protocol is made available to the public, VCs already have their hands on it for a significantly smaller price. Consequently, if this token gets popular and its price jumps, VCs are the true winners.Meanwhile, since meme coins are issued by the community, this is one sector VCs can’t profit from. Or couldn’t until recently. Shiba Inu closed a $12 million funding round with the participation of Mechanism Capital, Big Brain Holdings, Cypher Capital, and Shima Capital, among others, and this may turn the tide in the meme coin market.“Across sectors, industries, and opportunities, investors will seek returns in all corners of the market. So large-scale investments in meme coins are not really surprising,” says Zhang about the recent movement of VCs into these tokens. “The fundraising success of Shiba Inu suggests that even meme coins can capture serious investor attention when they align with a compelling narrative and show potential for broader ecosystem development based on community engagement.”Therefore, that’s where fundamental analysis shows its weight. Zhang believes that as more people get equipped with fundamental analysis tools, the number of serious investments directed at selected meme coins will show sustained growth over time.“These will likely be the ones that demonstrate real utility, ongoing social value, or strategic significance within the crypto market, beyond just the initial hype.”

SUI Token Shatters Recovery Hopes as It Falls Below $1 Peg - DailyCoin


        
The SUI token is struggling to recover from its price lows.



SUI has fallen below its one dollar peg.



The Sui network recently celebrated its first year anniversary.
SUI, the native token of the SUI system, had an impressive start to the year, doubling its year-start value to reach new highs. However, the situation took a different turn when the token suffered a sharp decline on May 12, 2024, reaching a bottom low before seeing slight recovery gains.However, optimism for SUI’s rebound has been cut short as prospects further dwindle, with the token now recording a new low.Sui Token Plummets to $0.9 MarkAccording to CoinMarketCap data on Thursday, May 9, SUI, currently wavering at $0.995, has suffered an approximate 6% decline in the past 24 hours, The token’s current training price marks its week low value, dropping it approximately 14% from its highest point this week, $1.141.
The underperformance marks SUI’s third consecutive week of losses, which has seen the token drop a staggering 40% in the last 30 days. The downward trend, which commenced following the geopolitical tension between Israel and Iran, has dashed the initially heightened hopes for SUI to reclaim its $2 peg and surpass its all time high record of $2.18.Sui’s downward trend is not isolated, fueled by its vulnerability to negative market trends and inability to swiftly recover.

SEC Cripples Ripple’s Latest Stablecoin Project - Says It Qualifies As Securities Offering | Cryptopolitan

No other crypto firm has gone to war with the SEC as Ripple has. Unfortunately, the legal face-offs are not over yet. The SEC vs Ripple cases still continue in the courts today, and just recently, the SEC has hinted at a new possible avenue to sue the XRP issuer. The XRP issuer has been battling the SEC for about four years now in court. The legal battles have somewhat crippled the firm, limiting innovations and eventually hurting the growth of XRP. In response, Ripple announced its plans to launch a stablecoin, pegged to the US dollar, to compete against the larger stablecoin issuers like Tether and CENTRE – a joint venture between Coinbase and Circle. Ripple Labs’ attempt to launch the stablecoin has hit yet another roadblock, as the SEC says the stablecoin qualifies as an unregistered securities offering just like XRP. The company announced the Stablecoin plans last month, and since then, the regulator has not been resting. The SEC’s issue with Ripple Labs’ StablecoinThe Securities and Exchange Commission continues to attack Ripple after it announced its plans for a new stablecoin project. The Stablecoin, according to Brad Garlinghouse, is meant to fight against the de-pegging events that have caused stablecoin users to lose billions. Despite this noble reason, the SEC remains adamant and thinks the XRP issuer is in the business of issuing out unregistered securities, just like it’s been doing over the years. “Ripple’s primary business continues to be, as it has been since 2013, unregistered sales of XRP. It also plans to issue a new unregistered crypto asset,” the filing read.The XRP issuer has had minor wins against the SEC over the four-year court battle. As the legal warfare nears its end, despite the existing challenges. The SEC reportedly demanded a $2 billion fine from Ripple Labs; however, the defendant only offered $10 million. The SEC thinks that a significantly low amount for the XRP issuers’ alleged violations of the law.“That certainly could be part of the solution. I think there is a certain strangeness that the SEC has kind of picked winners here: it said that Bitcoin is not a security, it said that Ether is not a security, but really everything else, I think, is kind of at risk. Particularly given what they have done in the lawsuit against Ripple. But, you know, we could do that.”Brad Garlinghouse, Ripple CEOBrad said this in an interview with CNN, hinting a stablecoin solution might be the proper alternative to XRP amid SEC scrutiny. Unfortunately, the SEC has a similar view on the yet-to-launch stablecoin as well.

Dogecoin (DOGE) Valued at $25,000,000 Leaves Robinhood Crypto in the Wake of the SEC’s Wells Notice - The Daily Hodl


								Tens of millions of dollars worth of the meme asset Dogecoin (DOGE) has left Robinhood Crypto after the firm received a Wells Notice from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).
New data from blockchain-tracking platform Bitcoinsensus reveals that 164 million DOGE worth $25 million was transferred out of Robinhood after the firm’s crypto branch received notice that the regulatory agency would be taking enforcement actions against it.










A Well Notice is a warning given by the SEC informing an entity that legal action is going to be taken against them, though it is not an indication of any wrongdoing. Robinhood received its notice on May 6th.
Earlier this week, crypto attorney Jake Chervinsky said that the SEC was abusing its power and issuing Wells Notices as a scare tactic.
“If the SEC brings as many enforcement actions as it has sent Wells Notices, it will be in flagrant violation of both the law and its Congressional mandate. If not, it’s clearly abusing the Wells process to get free discovery and terrorize upstanding US companies. Which is it?”
However, Robinhood CEO Vlad Tenev took to social media after the firm received the notice, saying that he would challenge the SEC in court if it came down to it.
“While we strive to maintain positive and productive relationships with our regulators, if necessary we will use our resources to contest this matter in the courts, with the intent of both defending our crypto business and establishing regulatory clarity in the United States for the benefit of our customers.”
News of the transfer had minimal impact on DOGE as the digital asset is trading for $0.149 at time of writing, a fractional increase during the last 24 hours.

Bitcoin network challenges: Are miners behind BTC's decline? - AMBCrypto



Bitcoin’s difficulty is expected to decline in the coming days.
Price of BTC fell along with the velocity of the coin.

Bitcoin [BTC] has been struggling to push past the $65,000 level for quite some time. One of the main determinants of BTC’s price would be the state of miners on the Bitcoin network.
Difficulty declines
A drop of over 6% in Bitcoin mining difficulty is expected for BTC in the next 24 hours. This would be the largest difficulty decrease since FTX collapsed in December 2022, which saw a drop of over 7%.
At press time, blocks were coming in at an average time of 10.7 minutes. The recent difficulty drop is likely due to a decrease in the network’s hash rate, which is the total computing power dedicated to mining Bitcoin.
Source: X
The revenue generated by miners declined significantly as well over the past month, from $72,000 to $59,000.
This decline in revenue can have a severe impact on not only the Bitcoin network, but also BTC’s price.
As miner revenues decline, it gets harder for miners to remain profitable, so miners have to resort to selling their BTC so that they can stay afloat. As a result, selling pressure on BTC increases.
Source: Blockchain.com
State of the Bitcoin network
Another thing that can impact miner revenue and BTC’s price would be the activity on the Bitcoin network. At the time of writing, Daily Active Addresses on the Bitcoin network had declined significantly.
This slowdown in activity could signal a potential decline in interest in Bitcoin’s ecosystem, which may impact sentiment around the network in the long run.
Source: Santiment
At press time, BTC was trading at $61,655.60. Also, the velocity at which BTC was trading at had plummeted significantly in the last few days. 
A falling velocity implied that the frequency with which BTC was being traded at had declined.

Coinbase sees infinite interoperability potential with Ethereum and USDC

Coinbase is preparing for a future of a billion customers using decentralized applications on millions of blockchains safely and securely in a system integrating the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) and Circle’s USD Coin (USDC). Coinbase head of tokenization Anthony Bassili, speaking at TokenizeThis 2024 in Miami, said Coinbase’s Ethereum layer-2 Base blockchain will save time on Know Your Customer (KYC) and Anti-Money Laundering (AML) with identity attestation through the Ethereum Attestation service and Coinbase verification, which creates a tag on the user’s so-called smart wallet. Coinbase verification is available after the customer has completed its KYC procedure. While that may not be sufficient in all cases, Bassili said:“We expect that eventually to evolve into something like a KYC reliance model. […] And it will start to form market structure that makes it a lot easier for a simpler KYC process.” Already more than 300,000 wallets have been attested. Related: Coinbase's Base could make it the NVIDIA of DeFiTo give those customers with wallets and verified identities Web3 access, Base will leverage the interoperability of EVM networks. The ecosystem will be supported by USDC. Coinbase took an equity stake in Circle in August. “Right now, we're somewhere above $28 billion of total assets” in Circle, Bassili said. Coinbase also has the ability to mint USDC.Coinbase head of tokenization Anthony Bassili (right) at TokenizeThis 2024. Source: Sam Bourgi/CointelegraphWhen robust tokenized assets in different asset classes arise, it could become possible to trade assets for assets, without going through the intermediate step of trading them for dollars. Bassili said:“I think […] we're a while away from [that goal], because we need regulatory structures to show up, we need products themselves to be designed with identity checks instantly, and there is a lot of market structure that is still has to come.”“Crypto is the perfect embodiment of a liquid free open market structure where you can design any amount of complexity into it and have assets, trade with each other, don't have to be dollar pairs trade,” Bassili said. In the meantime, USDC provides a first step to developing that market structure.Magazine: 6 Questions for Kim Hamilton Duffy of Centre

On the other hand, Shiba Inu, the second-largest meme coin, has also experienced challenges despite a notable 104% surge year-to-date. SHIB’s price soared by over 4% in the last 24 hours.

Similarly, the newly emerging meme coin PEPE saw a remarkable surge of over 560% in the last 90 days. However, the recent market slump has led to a 22% drop over the past week, followed by an 11.26% increase in the last 24 hours. Despite this, PEPE is still the third-largest meme crypto, trading at an average price of $0.000008514. Its 24-hour trading volume has risen by 18% to $900 million, maintaining a market cap of $3.58 billion.

The process is simple: after purchasing a meal pack, customers can download the Bithumb app and enter a coupon code inside the box to potentially win 10,000 won worth of Bitcoin.An additional 20,000 won worth of Bitcoin will be awarded to those who choose to create a Bitcoin account with NH Nonghyup Bank.

Despite delays in IPO plans, the exchange recently announced its plans to become the first crypto exchange listed on the South Korean stock market.
Crypto Regulations in South Korea
Over the past few years, South Korea has implemented stricter crypto regulations surrounding the market. Legislators have also implemented stricter penalties for crypto-related crimes and established new regulatory guidelines. As of the fourth quarter of 2023, South Korean financial authorities mandate that cryptocurrency users report any unlicensed exchanges operating within the country.Despite these regulations, the collaboration between Emart24 and Bithumb demonstrates the continued growth and integration of cryptocurrency within South Korea’s economy.

Chiliz Joins Forces with SBI Holdings in Japan


SBI Digital Asset Holdings, a branch of SBI Holdings that focuses on cryptocurrencies, has joined forces with Chiliz, a top sports blockchain provider. 
Together, the two companies are launching a joint venture in Japan. It aimed to enhance the Japanese sports landscape by introducing fan tokens from globally celebrated football clubs like Manchester City and AC Milan.
SBI Holdings Teams Up with Chiliz 
This partnership extends beyond access to fan tokens. It offers a variety of interactive experiences and rewards, such as game-day activations. It also provides opportunities to influence club-related decisions. 
With 82 fan tokens and over 150 sports entity partnerships, Chiliz leverages its platform, Socios.com, to boost fan engagement significantly.

Fernando Luis Vázquez Cao, CEO of SBI Digital Asset, emphasized the venture’s capability to deliver new experiences tailored to Japan’s robust fan culture. 

“This partnership allows us to harness the passion of Japanese sports fans, bringing them closer to the teams they love through innovative Web3 features,” he noted.


Integrating fan tokens in Japan aligns with local cultural norms. Japanese investors often seek engagement and perks, not just financial gains. Therefore, fan tokens offer these without needing ownership in sports teams.
This venture has grown to include Azuro, a major player in on-chain predictions. Chiliz uses Azuro’s advanced liquidity pools, tools, and Oracle solutions to enter the on-chain prediction market. This move lets Azuro platform applications launch with low initial costs, focusing on user engagement and revenue.

Mastercard, Visa, Citi, JPMorgan and Other Giants Start Experiments for Cryptocurrency Technology - Here are the Details - Bitcoin Sistemi


Mastercard is collaborating with some of the largest U.S. banks to test a shared ledger technology that could revolutionize the settlement of tokenized assets such as commercial bank money, Treasuries, and investment-grade debt securities.
The Regulated Payment Network's proof-of-concept system in testing will simulate transactions in dollars, aiming to enable transactions across borders and systems, reduce errors and fraud, and make the process faster and easier.


Currently, securities such as commercial bank money, wholesale central bank money, and investment grade debt are all managed in separate systems. The introduction of this ledger technology can significantly change the financial landscape. Once these assets are tokenized and run on the distributed ledger, they can be traded on the same system.

This trial builds on a previous 12-week test that started in late 2022 and focused on domestic interbank payments in the US and cross-border payments in dollars.





Participants in the new trial include Citigroup Inc., JPMorgan Chase & Co., US Bancorp, Wells Fargo & Co., Visa Inc., Swift, TD Bank NA and Zions Bancorp.

Pantera Capital Predicts Bitcoin Price at $117,000 by 2025


Pantera Capital projects an astonishing ascent for Bitcoin, estimating its value at $117,000 by August 2025. 
This price prediction hinges on historical data surrounding Bitcoin halvings — a phenomenon that halves the reward for mining a block on the network.
Pantera Capital’s Bitcoin Price Prediction
In a recent report, Pantera Capital suggests that post-halving periods herald significant bull rallies. However, after the 2024 halving, Bitcoin suffered a price correction to $57,000. This pattern is typical of previous market cycles and predicts a potent bull run leading up to 2025.

In 2023, Bitcoin dipped to $28,168, yet it experienced a 1.8x increase by 2024. Pantera Capital extrapolates from this trend a robust 4.2x climb by late August 2025, just 480 days post-halving, culminating near a striking $117,482. Another optimistic prediction suggests Bitcoin might climb as high as $155,000 by the same year.
However, achieving these numbers requires overcoming substantial market resistance, particularly around $63,000. Pantera Capital points to Bitcoin’s current trajectory, which includes a “triple top pattern.” The analysts also foresee continued volatility as an indicator of the challenges ahead.


“A pattern has formed that we often call the triple top pattern. BTC/USD is currently experiencing a corrective recovery. However, breaking through the $63,000 resistance level remains a challenge and goal. The greatest volatility occurs after a breakout,” the report noted.

Nevertheless, the firm’s analysis remains steadfast, supported by successful past predictions, like when Bitcoin hit a market bottom of $17,000.

Bitcoin Whales Acquire Nearly $1 Billion BTC Amidst Price Stagnation ⋆ ZyCrypto

&nbsp

&nbsp
Bitcoin has shown remarkable resilience amidst a history of price fluctuations in recent weeks. Notably, on 14th March, Bitcoin surged as high as $71,827 ahead of the halving event. However, since the beginning of May, the leading crypto asset has faced a notable downturn, dropping to as low as $57,000 towards the end of last month.



Nevertheless, despite this volatility, Bitcoin appears to have entered a phase of relative stability. Its price hovers between $61,000 and $64,000, showing minimal volatility compared to its past erratic movements. This period of price stagnation hints at a temporary balance in the market, with neither bullish nor bearish sentiments dominating.



That said, while some investors interpret this as a precursor to a potential price swing, others see it as an opportunity for strategic accumulation. On Wednesday, popular crypto analytics platform Santiment highlighted how Bitcoin whales have made significant accumulation moves following the recent price dip.



“As Bitcoin ranges tightly between $61,000 and $64,000, large whales have made some accumulation moves over the past 24 hours. Wallets with 1,000-10,000 BTC have collectively accumulated $941 million worth of coins, rebounding to their highest holding level in 2 weeks,” tweeted Santiment.







Notably, Santiment’s late finding aligns with previous reports indicating a similar trend. On May 3, Santiment reported how Bitcoin whales accumulated over 47,000 BTC (over the past 24 hours), demonstrating resilience amidst market fluctuations. The consistent accumulation by large holders amidst market uncertainty underscores their confidence in Bitcoin’s long-term viability and resilience.

That said, indicators like the MVRV 90-Day Ratio technically suggest that Bitcoin remains in an attractive buy zone, further bolstering investor sentiment. Ki Young Ju, CEO of Cryptoquant, also chimed in on Bitcoin’s current state, highlighting Bitcoin’s robust network fundamentals and suggesting a potential market cap three times its current size.



“Bitcoin network fundamentals could support a market cap three times its current size compared to the last cyclical top, potentially sustaining a price of $265K,” wrote Ju.



Elsewhere, Glassnode analysts “Negentropic” also echoed optimism, suggesting that Bitcoin is primed for further upward movement. According to the experts, last week’s “reversal candle,” coupled with its movement back into the Pennant Structure, indicates a potential breakout.



“BTC still looks like it is about to BLOW higher! Last week’s candle was a Reversal Candle – a Hammer with a long Wick. Price moved back into the Pennant Structure. This candle still dominates the structure. This week’s pullback hence seems like healthy Correction before higher. Correction often pulls back either 50% or 61.8% of the previous Impulse move.” They wrote on Thursday. 







Bitcoin was trading at $62,623 at press time, reflecting a 1.85% surge over the past 24 hours.

Crypto Presidential Rally: TRUMP Soars 36.2% And Flips BODEN


																In a year full of global elections, the crypto industry remains expectant and critical of every candidate’s stance on cryptocurrencies. The US presidential elections could pose a turning point for regulations and adoption that could affect the industry worldwide. 
On Wednesday, Donald Trump, former US president and Republican candidate, stated his support for the industry and criticized Biden’s administration for its stance on digital assets. MAGA (TRUMP), the Trump-inspired memecoin, saw its price skyrocket  63% in the following hours.

Trump’s Stance On Crypto 
The Republican candidate held a gathering on Wednesday at his Mar-a-Lago resort in Palm Beach, Florida. Holders of NFTs bearing Trump’s name and likeness attended the Trump Cards NFT Gala. 
During this event, the former US president strongly criticized Biden’s administration and its hostility towards the sector. He revealed he is “fine” with crypto and wants to make it a “solid” industry.
Trump claimed he’s the best option for those who are in favor of cryptocurrencies:

(…) I’m fine with it. I want to make sure it’s good and solid and everything else. But I’m good with it. And if you want, if you like crypto in any form, and it comes in a lot of different forms, if you’re in favor of crypto, you better vote for me.

Moreover, the Republican candidate asserted that “crypto is moving out of the US because of the hostility towards it,” something he alleges he doesn’t want to continue and promises to stop.


When asked what he would do to stop the exodus of digital asset businesses, he stated that to embrace them, they would have to let them be in the country. To achieve this, the candidate promised a more welcoming regulatory framework for crypto. 
As part of his jab at the current administration, Trump mimicked US President Joe Biden, claiming he would be clueless if asked about cryptocurrencies. He further added, “The Democrats are very much against it.”
TRUMP Flips BODEN As Price Soars 
After Trump’s declarations, two memecoins inspired by the politicians saw a price reaction. Jeo Boden (BODEN) soared 23.5% in the following hour, going from $0.34 to $0.42. 
Since then, the price has retraced to hover between the $0.35-$0.36 range. BODEN is trading at $0.3492, representing a 15.1% increase in the last 24 hours. 
The token’s daily trading volume also saw a significant 35.7% surge, with over $20 million traded in the past day. Despite benefiting from the Republican candidate’s jab at its inspiration, BODEN Still displays red numbers in the longer timeframes, with a 29.9% and 59.8%  weekly and monthly decrease.


As a result, TRUMP’s $252 million market capitalization flipped BODEN’s $239 million. The Trump-inspired token became the 14th largest memecoin by market capitalization, per CoinGecko data.

TRUMP trades at $5.43 at the time of writing, representing a 36.2% increase in the last 24 hours.

Diving into Bitcoin whale activity: 15K BTC snapped up in 2 days - AMBCrypto



A cohort of BTC whales have continued to fill their bags.
This has happened despite the coin’s recent price action.

Bitcoin [BTC] whales have intensified accumulation despite the coin’s recent decline below $62,000. 
According to on-chain data provider Santiment, BTC whales holding between 1000 and 10,000 coins accumulated 15,121 BTC valued at $930 million between the 7th and the 8th of May.
 This pushed the cohort’s total BTC holding to its highest level in 14 days.


At press time, this group of BTC investors held 38% of the coin’s circulating supply of 20 million BTC. 
BTC has the bears to contend with
At press time, BTC exchanged hands at $61,621. The coin recently crossed below its 20-day simple moving average (SMA), putting it at risk of a further decline in the short term. 
When an asset’s price falls below its 20-day SMA, it suggests that the short-term trend for the asset is downward. 
Market participants often view this as a sign that sellers are in control and that the asset’s price will likely continue declining.
Readings from BTC’s price movement on a 1-day chart showed that its price fell below its 20-day SMA on the 7th of May and has since witnessed a 3% decline in its value.
Further, the coin has seen a decline in demand among general market participants. An assessment of its key momentum indicators showed them below their respective center lines at press time.
For example, the coin’s Relative Strength Index (RSI) was 44.12, while its Money Flow Index (MFI) was 23.21. At these values, the indicators showed significant bearish pressure in the market.
Likewise, as of this writing, the coin’s Chaikin Money Flow (CMF) was poised to cross below the zero line. This indicator measures the money flow into and out of the coin’s market. 
A CMF value below zero indicates market weakness, suggesting increased liquidity exit.

If the bears strengthen their position, they may pull the coin’s price down to the support line of BTC’s descending channel pattern.

 If this happens, the leading cryptocurrency asset will exchange hands at the $57,000 price region. 
However, if this bearish projection is invalidated as bullish activity gains momentum, BTC’s price may rally toward the pattern’s resistance line and attempt a crossover.

CZ hits back at WSJ, Hong Kong crypto ETF’s take ‘$50B equivalent’: Asia Express


            
Our weekly roundup of news from East Asia curates the industry’s most important developments.



Binance is under scrutiny yet again 



Cryptocurrency exchange Binance has been accused of firing its own investigators after discovering that its VIP client, props trading firm DWF Labs, engaged in alleged acts of market manipulation. 



A May 9 Wall Street Journal report claimed that DWF Labs engaged in market manipulation, wash trading, and inflated trading volumes amounting to $300 million through deals with crypto projects. After the exchange’s surveillance team recommended offboarding the client, Binance allegedly sided with DWF Labs and fired the investigator, arguing insufficient evidence for the claim.

Binance has denied involvement. “We affirm our strict market surveillance program. We do not tolerate market abuse,” said the exchange in a tweet. “Market maker competition is fierce and our investigation team’s job is to be neutral and look at the evidence without any bias, including bias that might come from market-making firms’ claims against their competitors.”  



According to the exchange, its staff has offboarded 355,000 users with a transaction volume of $2.5 trillion for violating its terms of use in the past three years. 



DWF Labs, too, has denied the allegations. “We want to clarify that many recent allegations reported in the press are unfounded and distort the facts,” they said. “DWF Labs operates with the highest standards of integrity, transparency, and ethics, and we remain committed to supporting you and our over 700 partners across the crypto ecosystem.”



Binance’s co-founder and spouse of its co-founder and former CEO Changpeng Zhao, penned a response dripping in irony, writing: 




“I am very grateful to the WSJ for their consistent and long-term devotion to Binance, which has greatly increased our exposure and saved us a lot of marketing budget. However, I have noticed an interesting phenomenon where some mainstream media articles are increasingly driven by emotions and biases rather than facts. For example, the complaints of former employees can become the basis of an article, while Binance’s proactive assistance to law enforcement agencies in investigating and apprehending the mastermind behind Zkasino (as a matter of fact) is not deemed worthy of reporting.” 




DWF Labs is a prominent trading firm in the crypto industry. Founded by Andrei Grachev in 2021, the firm invests in promising projects and provides long-term financial support to them, as stated on its website. 






Thailand Web3 Music Festival concludes 



Music idol protocol Fansland’s music festival in Bangkok, Thailand attracted over 30,000 festival go-ers from May 4 to 5. 



The Web3 aspect was perhaps of less appeal than a performance by South Korean pop star PSY, the creator of “Gangnam Style.” More than 20 other artists graced the stage, including renowned Cantonese Hip-Hop artist Edison Chen, powerhouse vocalists Henry Lau, Gen1es, BKPP, Chanyeol, BUS, Dreamnote, Pretzelle, Sistar19, Taemin, and 24kGoldn. “Their electrifying performances set the stage ablaze, creating an atmosphere of pure excitement and energy that left the audience in awe,” organizers breathlessly reported. 







In addition to human performances, the festival featured tokenized music products and AI-generated music idols. 



The festival featured a unique NFT ticketing system where tickets were minted as NFTs on Fansland and became tradable on secondary markets. The tickets can also be used as an access point to interact with Fansland DeFi. 



The first batch of NFT ticket holders for this music festival automatically became early participants in Fansland.AI, unlocking perks such as token airdrops and future whitelist qualifications. 



Fansland aims to create a decentralized fan economy infrastructure so that global music lovers can interact with their singers and idols. It focuses on Web3 music festivals, NFT ticketing, and real-world asset DeFi. Last month, Fansland secured a $10 million funding round led by IME, Linear Capital, and Falablock.

Hong Kong ETFs attract $317M, but can it last?



The total assets under management of six Hong Kong spot Bitcoin and Ether ETFs have surpassed $317.4 million since their inception on April 30. 



Data from local crypto exchange OSL, which also serves as the trading platform and sub-custodian for a few of the aforementioned ETFs, show that a combined 2,079.42 Bitcoin (BTC) and 396.79 Ether (ETH) have flowed in. 



“Together, we have addressed some of the most intricate challenges of our industry —regulated digital asset custody, ensuring stable liquidity, and bridging traditional financial markets with the speed of on/off-chain operations,” commented Patrick Pan, CEO of OSL. 



The Hong Kong spot crypto ETFs are denominated in three fiat currencies and allow investors to subscribe and redeem ETF units in both crypto and fiat. However, it appears that the vast majority of assets managed by the ETFs — well over $200 million, were subscribed prior to their listing. 



As per data compiled by Farside Investors, total asset flow into the six ETFs has amounted to just $24.7 million since April 30, a mere fraction of the tens of billions of dollars that went into U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs in their first week of launch. 



Nevertheless, many industry veterans remain optimistic



“The HK ETFs at $310m is equiv to $50b in US market,” said senior Bloomberg ETF analyst Eric Balchunas on April 6, in reference to the Hong Kong market’s relative size and liquidity compared to the United States. “So in that regard these ETFs already as big to their local mkt as US ones are to its.”



ApolloSats co-founder Thomas Fahrer claimed “rumors are swirling of a pending approval into Hong Kong Stock Connect which would allow Mainland Chinese to invest and could ignite this market.” However these are merely rumors and mainland Chinese investors are currently prohibited from accessing the Hong Kong crypto ETFs, barring a population of over 1 billion from entering the space. 



Despite high hopes, the Hong Kong crypto ETFs did not attract as many assets as expected. 



$128 million pledged for Hong Kong crypto ETF liquidity fund 



Market makers remain bullish on the prospects of the Hong Kong ETFs. 



On May 8, digital asset managers LD Capital, Antalpha Ventures, and Highblock pledged a total of $128 million “to provide market-making services to Hong Kong ETFs, aimed at enhancing liquidity, improving the efficiency of capital flows, and reducing the risks associated with liquidity fluctuations and transactional volatility.”



LD Capital is a digital asset fund with a focus on primary and secondary blockchain investments, with over 300 blockchain enterprises in its portfolio. Antalpha Ventures is a financial services platform affiliated with Bitmain, a major manufacturer of Bitcoin mining ASICs. 



Highblock Limited, which was established by former executives from major international digital asset trading platforms, has more than ten years of experience in blockchain quantitative trading. The company is licensed for digital asset quantitative trading in Hong Kong and provides quantitative trading and investment portfolio management services in the digital asset sector.



The liquidity addition may be significant as due to liquidity restraints in the Hong Kong market and ongoing market downturn in China, the six spot crypto ETFs only saw trading volume of around $100 million on day one.

                        To commemorate the 25th anniversary of His Majesty Otumfuo Osei Tutu II’s reign, Ghana Post launched a collection of “Crypto stamps” linked to non-fungible tokens (NFTs) on May 9. The initiative blends Ghanaian cultural heritage with cutting-edge blockchain technology, offering a unique way to celebrate the King’s Silver Jubilee.
Ghana NFT Stamps: Bridging Tradition and Technology
These limited-edition Ghana Crypto Stamps, priced at $18 (250 Ghanaian cedi) each, are linked to unique NFTs, verifiable on the blockchain, providing collectors with proof of ownership and authenticity. Only 7,200 Crypto Stamps are available, making them potentially valuable collectible for collectors and technology enthusiasts.The integration of NFTs ensures the security and transparency of the Ghana crypto stamp collection. By using blockchain technology, collectors can verify the authenticity of their stamps through a simple smartphone scan, generating a unique authentication message for each scan. This process effectively combats counterfeiting and safeguards the integrity of each collectible.With the release of these NFTs, Ghana has become the first African country to release a commemorative stamp collection on the blockchain.
African Adoption of Cryptocurrency
Ghana’s foray into NFT stamps reflects a growing adoption of cryptocurrency and blockchain technology across Africa.The South African Reserve Bank recently announced plans to regulate and integrate cryptocurrency and central bank digital currency (CBDC) into its financial system. This initiative seeks to modernize payment infrastructure, enhance access to financial technology, and ultimately benefit the local economy. While the South African plan focuses on the domestic market, it underscores the continent’s increasing openness to embracing digital currencies.

                        Grayscale, the company behind the world’s largest Bitcoin (BTC) ETF, saw flat revenues in Q1 despite non-stop outflows from its world-famous fund throughout the quarter.
Grayscale’s Bitcoin: Outflows VS Revenue
Per a shareholder letter from Grayscale’s parent company Digital Currency Group (DCG), the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) netted $156 million between January and March – nearly identical to its Q4 2023 figure.As usual, this comprised most of DCG’s total $229 million revenue, up 11% from the prior quarter. The conglomerate’s gains were primarily driven by its mining pool giant Foundry and investment platform Luno, up 35% and 46% respectively.
“While Grayscale expected outflows alongside increased competition under the ETF wrapper, Q1 revenue attributable to GBTC nevertheless exceeded our expectations,” read the shareholder letter.
Upon converting into a Bitcoin spot ETF on January 11, GBTC lowered its long-standing management fee from 2% to 1.5%, following through on a promise to cut charges for critical investors who often labeled the fund as “exploitative.”However, most of Grayscale’s competitors who launched alongside them that day sported ultra-low fees of 0.3% or lower, including funds launched by recognizable names like BlackRock and Fidelity.As such, new and prospective Bitcoin ETF buyers had no incentive to invest through Grayscale, leaving little to no demand/inflows to counterbalance regular outflows from the fund.Such outflows have been seismic, to be sure: the fund now only controls 291,790 BTC, less than the 619,000 BTC it held as of January 10.As explained by market analysts at Glassnode, Grayscale’s investor base mostly represents long-term holders who have chosen to sell their Bitcoin at a profit as the asset’s price climbed.Last week, the fund experienced its first net inflow day since January 11.Losing Bitcoin ETF Market Share
That said, thanks to the value of its existing BTC rising over the past quarter, the company’s assets under management (AUM) has suffered less, falling from $30 billion to $18 billion.BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) has nearly caught up to GBTC in size, controlling 273,25 BTC as of May 8, according to on-chain data.On a yearly basis, DCG’s revenue rose 51% compared to Q1 2023. Meanwhile, Bitcoin’s price has risen 125% since this time last year.Regulators are currently reviewing an application for Grayscale to launch an Ether (ETH) spot ETF, though analysts don’t like their odds of approval. The company recently rescinded its application to launch an Ether futures ETF.

Binance Fined $4.3M in Canada as Global Regulators Circle - DailyCoin


        
Binance has been slapped with a multi-million dollar fine in Canada.



The fine comes about a year after the firm left the jurisdiction.



The firm is also under scrutiny in several other jurisdictions.
Binance, the world’s largest crypto exchange by market capitalization, can not seem to catch a break.The crypto exchange’s years of operating in the gray area and eschewing traditional corporate practices appear to be catching up with it. In November 2023, the exchange was slapped with $4.3 billion in fines from the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ)  for money laundering violations.
Now, the firm has been slapped with another fine, this time in Canada for similar violations.Binance Slapped With $4.3M FineIn a press statement on Thursday, May 7, the Financial Transactions and Reports Analysis Centre of Canada (FINTRAC) disclosed that it had imposed an “administrative monetary penalty” of $6 million CAD or about $4.3 million USD on Binance for failing to comply with anti-money laundering and counter-terrorism financing rules.According to the regulator, the crypto exchange failed to report transactions over $10,000 on the exchange. The fine comes nearly a year after the exchange disclosed that it was closing shop in the country, citing restrictive regulations related to “stablecoins and investor limits.”A Global Noose Tightening?Beyond the U.S. and Canada, Binance faces significant regulatory scrutiny in several other jurisdictions, including the Philippines and Nigeria. Regulators have moved to block the exchange’s online presence in the Philippines.
In Nigeria, the firm faces charges of money laundering and tax evasion. The situation in Nigeria is further complicated by the arrest of the exchange’s Chief Financial Crime Compliance Officer, Tigran Gambaryan. The American has been held in the country for over two months and named in the charges against the exchange.On the Flipside 
Despite its several regulatory challenges, Binance is still the largest crypto exchange in the world.



Binance CEO Richard Teng has committed to steering the firm down the regulatory-compliant path.
Why This Matters The recent fine Binance faces adds to the exchange’s growing regulatory troubles. At the same time, it is another signal of shifting industry dynamics compelling crypto exchanges to comply with regulations in their jurisdictions.Read this for more on Binance’s history with Canada:Binance Canada Exit Leaves Crypto Community SplitFollow Ethereum’s latest effort to improve wallet UX:How Ethereum EIP-7702 Boosts Wallet UX with Minimal Downsides

Shiba Inu Team Issues Critical Warning To SHIB Community Following Major Listing | Bitcoinist.com


								The Shiba Inu team has issued a crucial warning to its community, alerting them to the presence of fraudulent groups seeking to exploit the trust of SHIB community members for personal gain. This cautionary message from the team arrives as the cryptocurrency scored another significant listing milestone.
SHIB Team Cautions Against Scams
The Shiba Inu team has advocated for heightened vigilance against scams targeting community members. In a recent X (formerly Twitter) post, Shibarmy Scam Alerts, a social media handle dedicated to exposing scams, issued a stern warning regarding multiple scam attempts observed on Telegram social media platform.
The scam tracker has urged community members to watch out for fake or fraudulent groups impersonating legitimate Shiba Inu channels on Telegram. They disclosed tactics employed by these deceptive channels, including “promising giveaways, exclusive content, investment opportunities, and offering assistance for transaction issues to deceive unsuspecting community members.  
Excluding Telegram, the Shiba Inu community has also seen a rise in scam activities via X, with numerous scammers targeting community members using similar impersonation tactics or phishing attacks. 
While informing Shiba Inu members of these latest scam attacks on the community, Shibarmy Scam Alerts also outlined various ways SHIB community members can protect their privacy and security. The SHIB tracker emphasized the importance of verifying the authenticity of Telegram groups by checking for verification badges and announcements from reputable sources. 
Furthermore, the team stressed the significance of avoiding suspicious links and refraining from sharing wallet addresses in public chat rooms to reduce the likelihood of becoming a primary target for malicious attackers. Finally, Shibarmy Scam Alerts has urged users to stay updated on security alerts and adhere to optimal security practices, such as reporting any suspicious scam activities to the relevant authorities.  
Shiba Inu Gets Listed By Crypto Exchange Nexo
Amidst efforts to combat scam attempts within the Shiba Inu community, the cryptocurrency is celebrating a new milestone, securing listings from major exchanges. Nexo, a Switzerland-based all-in-one crypto platform, announced in a post on X on May 7, that it has officially integrated Shiba Inu into its crypto offerings. 
In its post, the crypto exchange lauded SHIB’s impressive growth over the years, highlighting the important role the Shiba Inu community, including its developer and dedicated supporters, has taken in boosting the development of the SHIB ecosystem. 
This listing also comes as Shiba Inu’s demand in the broader crypto market is growing at a rapid pace. Including Nexo, over 50 other crypto platforms or exchanges have listed SHIB, such as Binance, Robinhood, Bitget, and recently, Bitcoin.com.au.

Crypto influencers become 'PokÃ©mon cards' on Blast game - Crypto Briefing




Influencers from the crypto community on X were turned into a trading card game by the Blast-based game Fantasy.top. In the past four days, the cards related to these influencers reached 9,518 Ether (ETH) in trading volume, according to a Flipside dashboard created by user Hildobby.The cards’ power level is defined by how regularly the influencers publish with their X account, their follower count, and the reach of their tweets. Moreover, the more an influencer card is used by players, the more they receive from Fantasy.top. The power levels are based on the last seven days.Image: Fantasy.topFantasy.top leverages the current narrative of social finance, or SocialFi, which is hot after Friend.tech launched its native token FRIEND. FRIEND launched at an initial price of $3.03 but fell sharply in just three hours to $0.89. However, the token made a significant recovery to $2.19 at the time of writing.A crypto researcher known as DeFi Edge explained in his newsletter that Fantasy.top is better than Friend.tech at aligning the interests of users, influencers, and the protocol itself.“Influencers will get a share of revenue from: users/card traders want to buy cards from their favorite influencers; influencers are intrinsically motivated to improve their X engagement; this boosts their points, so users and influencers are perfectly aligned; the platform is giving money to influencers whose cards are used in competitions, so influencers are happy; the protocol wants more traders and influencers on their platform, so they’ll keep shipping features to make Fantasy.top more attractive.”Influencers receive 1.5% of all the fees collected from the trading volume of their respective cards, and also a 10% cut on pack sales which is split between the cards discovered. Packs are like boosters found in traditional trading card games, where a user gets random cards by opening them. At the time of writing, the platform’s marketplace generated 285.5 ETH in fees, equivalent to $863,000.The Fantasy.top platform is only accessible with referral codes, and it doesn’t have a native token yet.

Ethereum Whale Makes Massive Bet on ETH After 20% Price Drop | Cryptoglobe


                                
An Ethereum whale has made a massive bet on the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization after withdrawing funds from leading cryptocurrency exchange Binance and staking them, to then borrow with those holdings and buy more.



According to data first shared by on-chain analysis service Lookonchain the Ethereum whale withdrew 6,030 ETH tokens worth over $18 million from leading cryptocurrency exchange Binance as it kept on accumulating funds since the beginning of the month, to the point they managed to have 10,758 ETH worth over $32.14 million in their wallet.



The whale then swapped their ETH for Lido Staked ETH (stETH), a liquid derivative token representing Ether that’s staked on Lido, a decentralized liquid staking protocol. The tokens represent ETH that’s earning from validating transactions on the network, while being liquid to use on other decentralized finance protocols.



The whale then deposited the stETH into decentralized lending protocol Aave to borrow $28.5 million in stablecoins, which it then used to buy more ETH, effectively leveraging their position on the second-largest cryptocurrency.











            
            

            
            

            
            

        

The whale’s bet on ETH comes after the cryptocurrency lost nearly 20% of its value over the last 30-day period to now trade below the $3,000 mark, while still being up around 30% year-to-date.



As CryptoGlobe reported a major ETH whale has recently cashed in on a successful year, as after purchasing a significant amount of ETH at around $1,890 per token, the whale started taking profit.



The whale first withdrew 12,906 ETH, valued at roughly $24.39 million at the time, from the leading cryptocurrency exchange Binance. The tokens were then deposited into Lido, before the whale withdrew 7,000 ETH from it and redeposited the funds on Binance to sell them.

                        The Ethereum (ETH) price is swinging either side of the $3,000 level as traders monitor a spike in whale purchases and ask whether the cryptocurrency could soon be set for a rebound.On-chain-focused analytics X account @lookonchain reported on Wednesday that a whale recently accumulated $32.14 million in ETH.These tokens were withdrawn from Binance, before being sent to Aave to borrow $28.5 million in stablecoins.These stablecoins were then promptly used to buy more Ethereum.Increased buying activity from whales is almost always taken as a good sign for a cryptocurrency.Whales are often looked at as smart money that might have some market insight the rest of us don’t.Ether bulls will be hoping that accumulation from this whale marks the bottom of ETH’s recent dip.The Ethereum price, last at $3,020, is down 26% versus its early March highs.The Ethereum price has pulled 26% lower versus its March highs. Source: TradingViewEthereum Underperforming Bitcoin – Here’s Why
The downturn in the Ethereum price since March is mostly a result of broader market conditions turning less bullish.After hitting record highs above $73,000 in March on ETF demand optimism, easing ETF flows and macro headwinds have forced Bitcoin lower to the $62,000s.However, where Bitcoin is currently down around 15% versus its March peak, Ethereum’s pullback has been harsher.That can partially be explained by the fact that Ether is generally a higher beta asset versus Bitcoin. That’s to say, its likely to perform relatively better in times of risk-on and relatively worse in times of risk-off.But its also likely due to the pricing out of optimism that spot Ethereum ETFs will soon gain approval.The SEC is widely expected to reject these ETF applications this month as it probes crypto firms for evidence that Ethereum might be a security.However, given these rejections are now widely expected, this is unlikely to have much market impact.
Ethereum Price Prediction – Where Next for ETH?
While whale activity has some hoping the Ethereum price could soon rebound, technical analysis suggests the outlook remains fragile.The Ethereum price remains locked within a downward trend channel that has been in play since March.It has also broken to its 50 and 100DMAs. A recovery to the $3,200 area is plausible, but this is a very strong area of resistance.With the next leg of the crypto market rally unlikely to take hold anytime soon, Ether could continue to struggle.While whale activity has some hoping the Ethereum price could soon rebound, technical analysis suggests the outlook remains fragile. Source: TradingViewA test of support at $2,700 in the coming weeks is very plausible, especially if Bitcoin dips back under $60,000.This is roughly in line with where the 200DMA resides and so should be a strong zone of support.
Ether Turns Inflationary as Ethereum Fees Drop 
The recent Dencun upgrade has reduced Ethereum fees by as much as 4x, according to CryptoQuant data.That has substantially reduced the cryptocurrency’s burn rate, with the Ether supply recently turning inflationary as a result.This has concerned some ETH traders. Many see continued ETH deflation as a key value proposition for holding the cryptocurrency.However, these traders must remember the chilling impact that high fees has on Ethereum’s adoption.If Ethereum is going to retain its spot as the dominant smart-contract-enabled blockchain in web3, lowering fees is key.After all, why would everyday users choose to transact on Ethereum if fees are 100x higher than on other chains.
ETH Alternative to Consider – Mega Dice (DICE)
Crypto investors looking for investments with greater upside potential than ETH should check out presale investing.Web3 projects and protocols often sell their native tokens at a discount to early investors to raise funds for development.If presale investors can find a good project that gains traction in the market, they can book exponential gains.One project that analysts at Cryptonews are a big fan of is Mega Dice Casino.This already well-established crypto casino has launched a presale of its utility token, DICE.DICE holders get big cashback benefits on their wagers and can generate passive income via DICE staking.The crypto casino is also running a $750,000 airdrop to reward early presale investors.The project has already raised $870,000. Potential investors may want to move quickly, as the DICE price will rise when the $1 million milestone is hit.Check Out Mega Dice Casino’s Presale

Bitcoin Mining Difficulty Is Plummeting-Here’s Why - Decrypt

We do the research, you get the alpha!Get exclusive reports and access to key insights on airdrops, NFTs, and more! Subscribe now to Alpha Reports and up your game!Go to Alpha ReportsBitcoin just got much easier to mine—should we be worried? Data from BTC.com shows that Bitcoin mining difficulty plunged nearly 6% to 83.1 trillion hashes yesterday. The higher the mining difficulty—measured through the energy and resources that miners use to keep the network secure—the more difficult Bitcoin is to attack.A drop in difficulty, therefore, isn’t a good sign. But it’s expected, at least in the short term, experts told Decrypt.“If there isn’t enough margin for miners to make a profit, they turn off, which causes the hash rate to go down,” Luxor mining pool CEO Nick Hansen told Decrypt.“Hash rate” refers to the speed at which a miner produces hashes—the process of encrypting data. This model is known as proof-of-work, a key differentiator for Bitcoin. Bitcoin last month underwent a quadrennial event called the halving. The update cut miner rewards in half from 6.25 BTC for each block they process to 3.125 BTC. Miners—who produce new coins and keep the network ticking along by processing new transactions—now have to work harder to stay in the game. And with smaller rewards but harder work, a lot of miners are closing up shop altogether. Nishant Sharma, founder at BlocksBridge Consulting—a research and communications strategy firm dedicated to the Bitcoin mining industry—said that this is what usually happens after a halving. “After a Bitcoin halving, the drop in mining rewards leads less efficient miners to unplug their machines,” he said. “This self-adjusting feature favors leaner operations, as remaining miners receive increased rewards due to the reduced difficulty,” said Sharma.Scott Norris, CEO of mining firm Optiminer, concurred: “This is a normal occurrence after a halving event and healthy for the network and the well positioned miners,” he said.“The miners who planned properly will grow or the ones who turned off will get newer tech and find cheaper energy while everyone waits for the price to reflect the halving,” Norris added. “Either way, the network will continue to grow.”The price of Bitcoin is also playing a part in the drop in mining difficulty: the asset touched a new all-time high of $73,737 last month but today stands at $62,506, a drop of 15%, according to CoinGecko. If the asset were priced higher, mining the asset would be more profitable, rewards for miners would be higher and more would be able to stay in business. But a declining BTC price makes this more difficult, compounding the effects of the halving.Still, Norris says this isn't a surprise—and neither is the lull in the market.“It always happens this way,” said Norris. “Historically, it’ll be late in the year before we see much price rise [for Bitcoin].”Stay on top of crypto news, get daily updates in your inbox.

Bitcoin (BTC) on Verge of Losing $60,000, Is Shiba Inu (SHIB) Ready for It? Solana (SOL) Forms Reversal Pattern

Bitcoin is currently on the brink of dropping below the $60,000 level, a significant psychological and technical level for the cryptocurrency. As observed on the chart, a descending trendline is clearly applying downward pressure, guiding Bitcoin into forming lower lows. This pattern suggests that the downward momentum might continue in the near term.The current market dynamics show Bitcoin's price being squeezed by this descending trendline. Every attempt to push upwards meets resistance, leading to lower highs — a classic indicator of a continuing downtrend. Notably, the volume of trades has been decreasing, which typically indicates a weakening of the current trend and potentially sets the stage for a trend reversal. However, the current signals suggest that the market is not yet ready to reverse to being bullish.BTC/USD Chart by TradingViewAdding to the complexity of the movements is the potential formation of a higher low, which could be the first sign of an impending shift in trend. This is a critical observation as it could signify that although the overarching trend is bearish, there is some buying interest at lower levels that prevents further drops, providing a temporary floor for Bitcoin's price.The immediate future of Bitcoin's price largely depends on its interaction with the trendline and key moving averages. Currently, the 50-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA) sits around $65,000, acting as potential upper resistance in case of any bullish reversal.Shiba Inu hits thresholdShiba Inu is currently navigating a critical phase as it hovers around a strong support level at approximately 0.00002260.The current chart formation presents a descending triangle pattern, a typical bearish signal in technical analysis, suggesting that SHIB could be under significant selling pressure. This pattern is forming just as SHIB tests its support, making the 0.00002260 level crucial for determining its short-term trajectory. A break below this could lead to a test of the next major support at the 0.00002100 level, aligning closely with the 100-day EMA. It often acts as a dynamic support in downtrends, providing a potential rebound zone for the price.Conversely, the immediate resistance is located around 0.00002400. Overcoming this level could invalidate the bearish pattern and possibly trigger a short-term bullish reversal. However, the convergence of the EMAs above this price point may complicate any upward movements, potentially capping gains and adding to the volatility.Given these dynamics, the situation with Shiba Inu remains highly uncertain. The descending triangle, combined with the convergence of moving averages and key support and resistance levels, suggests that SHIB could experience increased volatility in the near future. This unpredictability makes it a risky asset for traders and investors at this time.Is Solana aiming at reversal?Solana is currently showing signs of a potential reversal pattern. As it approaches the 100-day EMA we might see a reversal. However, it is important to note that this EMA has not been tested before, which brings a degree of uncertainty about its reliability as a support.The current price movement has brought SOL closer to what might be seen as a critical juncture. The nearest solid support level is established around $128, but this level has already been breached once, adding to the unpredictability of its strength in holding future dips. Such breaches can undermine confidence in the support level, suggesting that it may not be as robust as hoped.Despite these concerns, there are positive signs in the market dynamics. The descending volume indicates that selling pressure is diminishing, which could mean that sellers are getting exhausted. This scenario typically sets the stage for buyers to regain control and potentially drive the price upwards. However, the volume profile does not support the formation of an inverse Head and Shoulders pattern, a common bullish reversal indicator, casting some doubts on the immediacy of a bullish turnaround.In the midterm, if buyers can capitalize on the reduced selling pressure, there is a chance for Solana to make significant gains.

$300M Scandal Rocks Binance: Fired Investigators Accuse DWF Labs Of Manipulative Trading | Bitcoinist.com


								Binance, one of the world’s largest cryptocurrency exchanges, has come under scrutiny after a Wall Street Journal report revealed that the platform fired its top investigators following their allegations of wash trading involving a top VIP client, DWF Labs. 
Binance Refutes Wash Trading Allegations
The report alleges that DWF Labs conducted over $300 million in wash trades across seven tokens in 2023, manipulating the price of Yield Guild Games’ native token, YGG and other cryptocurrencies. 
However, Binance has refuted the allegations, stating that the transactions were proprietary and did not constitute manipulation. The exchange also accused the head of the monitoring team of collaboration with DWF’s competitors, leading to his termination.

In response to the Wall Street Journal report, Binance affirmed its strict market surveillance program and commitment to combating market abuse. The exchange stated that it does not tolerate such practices and has offboarded nearly 355,000 users with a transaction volume of over $2.5 trillion for violating its terms of use in the past three years. 
Binance emphasized the importance of maintaining “neutrality and unbiased investigation”, even in the face of claims made by market-making firms against their competitors. The exchange aims to ensure healthy competition in the industry and protect users from market manipulation.
DWF Labs Strongly Denies Accusations
Binance heavily relies on VIP customers, who contribute two-thirds of the platform’s total trading volume. The report highlights a similar incident involving the Tron Foundation last summer, which Binance investigated. In response to the WSJ report on DWF, Binance co-founder He Yi said:  
We have been monitoring the MM market and we are very strict. We do not target any fund; There is competition among MMs, and the means are very shady. You can buy PR as you like, but don’t get close to me. We will ensure our own fairness and not participate, but we will also report truthfully to the monitor and other regulatory authorities.
DWF Labs, the VIP client accused of wash trading, has responded to the allegations, asserting that they operate with the highest integrity, transparency, and ethics standards. 
The company stated that the recent allegations reported in the press are “unfounded and distort the facts.” DWF Labs remains committed to supporting its partners across the crypto ecosystem and vows to report all relevant situations to regulatory authorities truthfully.

In sum, the firing of Binance’s top investigators after they alleged wash trading by VIP client DWF Labs has raised concerns about market manipulation and the exchange’s handling of such incidents. 
Binance maintains that the transactions in question were proprietary and not manipulative while accusing the head of the monitoring team of collaboration with DWF’s competitors. 
As the investigation unfolds, the cryptocurrency industry will closely watch how Binance addresses these allegations and upholds its commitment to market surveillance and user protection.

Base set for ‘material share’ of SocialFi activity: Franklin Templeton

Trillion-dollar asset manager Franklin Templeton suggests “Base Season” has arrived with the rise of Social Finance (SocialFi) apps, with Base leading other Ethereum layer 2s in the vertical. “[It is] positioning itself well to capture a material share of SocialFi activity and remain a leader in the Ethereum L2 sector going forward,” Franklin Templeton said in a May report.About 46% of transactions related to SocialFi are on Base, which has increasingly stripped market share away from the BNB Chain and Polygon in recent months, according to one of the charts provided by Franklin Templeton.Franklin Templeton said support from Coinbase has played a key role in Base capturing nearly half of the SocialFi market share to date.Friend.tech is perhaps the most notable SocialFi application built on Base, which allows creators to connect and monetize their content through “key” shares or “tokenized attention.”“Base has hit a homerun in the world of SocialFi,” which will remain a “key vertical to watch” for Base’s adoption and growth over the long haul, Franklin Templeton said.Source: Franklin TempletonTheta Network, Decentralized Social, Fantasy.top and Steem are among the other popular SocialFi blockchains and protocols. Franklin Templeton highlighted the recent memecoin mania as another key contributor to Base’s rise in network activity. Related: Coinbase sees infinite interoperability potential with Ethereum and USDCBase is the third largest Ethereum layer 2 network by total value locked now with $5.4 billion, only trailing Arbitrum One and OP Mainnet at $15.9 billion and $6.90 billion respectively, according to L2BEAT.However, Base has risen from $1 billion to $5.4 billion in less than three months after it taking six months to break the $1 billion milestone, Meanwhile, Arbitrum One and OP Mainnet have seen their TVLs tallies fall over the last two months.Coinbase officially launched Base last August.

Biden Is "Destroying Crypto": Cardano Founder Lambasts Admin - DailyCoin


        
President Joe Biden has vowed to shut down Congress’s efforts to open banks to crypto customers.



Charles Hoskinson launched a tirade against the Biden administration.



The Cardano founder claimed that a vote for Biden was a vote against crypto.
The US crypto industry has been in a multi-year intense battle with the Biden administration, trying to navigate the nation’s murky and tangled web of legislation and its alleged campaign against digital assets.Hope glimmered for the industry after the US House of Representatives passed a groundbreaking resolution on Wednesday to overturn the SEC’s crypto accounting guidance, which had barred banks from handling crypto customers. However, before Congress could celebrate, US President Joe Biden vowed to stay the course with his anti-crypto stance, pledging to veto any pro-crypto legislation.
Appalled and angered by President Biden’s statement, many influential figures in the industry voiced their concerns, including Cardano founder Charles Hoskinson, who accused the current administration of hurting the US’ standing in the global crypto arena.A Vote For Biden is a Vote Against Crypto, Charles Hoskinson“Please understand the intent of this administration is to destroy the American cryptocurrency industry,” Charles Hoskinson warned in his latest social media post, expressing his deep-seated concerns about President Biden’s pledge to derail a major development for the crypto industry. The Cardano founder was visibly upset by President Biden’s statement, promising to veto the US House of Representatives’s decision to potentially allow banks to deal with crypto customers by rejecting the SAB 121 legislation that the SEC issued prohibiting banks from dealing with crypto.In his tirade, Hoskinson accused the current US administration of perpetuating lies throughout the years and hurting the crypto industry in “every way possible.” The crypto pundit highlighted a series of enforcement actions by the White House, including restricting access to bank accounts and deliberately avoiding clarity to impede legislative processes.
“A vote for Biden is a vote against cryptocurrencies,” Charles Hoksinson claimed. The contentious founder lamented that it caused him a great degree of heartburn to witness an industry with the potential to create hundreds of thousands of jobs being pushed beyond borders, despite many of the underlying technologies originating on US soil.Hoskinson Worries Biden is Driving Crypto Out of US SoilIn his video, the Cardano Founder highlighted the US’s pivotal role in inventing cryptography and algorithms, emphasizing the abundance of talent and infrastructure within the country. However, despite these advantages, President Biden’s staunch anti-crypto stance threatens to harm the industry and the 53 million Americans holding cryptocurrencies severely.The rowdy pundit cautioned President Biden’s hostile policies could trigger a brain drain from the country and potentially allow rivals like China and the Middle East to leverage or weaponize crypto against the US. However, while President Biden’s administration doubles down on the crypto industry, his major rival, former President Donald Trump, is embracing the asset class with open arms. Trump Rubber Stamps Crypto During a recent gala dinner Q&A with collectors of his “Mugshot Edition” NFT collection, Trump expressed his support for the besieged US crypto industry. When asked what he would do about firms leaving the US over regulatory hostility, Trump responded, “We’ll stop it because I don’t want that.” "If we're going to embrace [the crypto industry] then we have to let them be here," Trump added. During the session, the former president also took the opportunity to mock President Biden’s understanding of digital assets while drawing a line between both parties by distinguishing Democrats as the anti-crypto party. In contrast, Trump endorsed cryptocurrencies by saying, “I’m good with it.”Basking in the spotlight, President Trump delivered a parting shot: "If you're in favor of crypto, you better vote for Trump."On the Flipside
Crypto policy is not a concern for most voting Americans, as just 17% have invested in digital assets.



Under the U.S. Constitution, the House could override President Biden’s veto with a two-thirds majority vote.



Donald Trump’s campaign has announced that it will also accept cryptocurrency in donations.
Why This MattersThe crypto industry has been subjected to several punitive enforcement actions and regulatory crackdowns in recent years. President Biden’s pledge to veto pro-crypto legislation reveals Democrats’ public disdain for digital assets. Charles Hoskinson’s warning is important and should be considered, given that elections are only months away.FTX promises to offer pay more than what it owes to customers:FTX Pens Plan Promising 118% Cash Back to CreditorsCharles Hoskinson mulls Bitcoin Cash integration:Cardano’s Hoskinson Gauges Bitcoin Cash Integration With Poll

                        Georgia’s security service has claimed overseas actors are using crypto to fund a spate of protests that have divided the country.Thousands have taken to the streets in the capital Tbilisi in recent days, with smaller protests also taking place in the cities of Zugdidi, Kutaisi, and Gori.But the State Security Service of Georgia (SSSG) says the masterminds behind the protests are using “funds from abroad.”And, the SSSG claimed, protest organizers are making use of crypto in a bid to “cover their tracks.”
Georgia Protests Are ‘Crypto Funded,’ Says Intelligence Agency
The SSSG is Georgia’s state intelligence agency. Per the Georgian media outlet Ambebi, the SSSG said that “a group of people” based overseas is “planning and organizing rallies in the Georgian capital.”The agency claimed that these individuals want to engineer “destructive and violent incidents.” And the SSSG said:
“Citizens of Georgia who are based abroad – in particular a certain group of Georgians participating in the hostilities in Ukraine – in taking part in criminal plans.”
The agency accused these overseas “agents” of plotting to sabotage Tbilisi’s traffic networks.The agency said agents also plan to barricade access to the roads around government institutions and strategic facilities.It claimed these same individuals plan to block railway networks and “set up encampments” outside law enforcement agencies. The SSSG explained:
“[The masterminds] funds are receiving funds from abroad. And they are using cryptocurrency, in many cases, to cover their tracks.”
The SSSG thinks that “foreign instructors” visited Georgia “at the end of April of this year” to conduct “cryptocurrency transaction-related training sessions.”It said that “the organizers” of the protests “received instructions on how to secretly receive funding” for their “radical actions.”Bill Sparks Fury in Georgia
Protests have raged in Tbilisi in recent days, with many taking to the streets to vent their anger about a so-called “foreign agents” bill.Many have taken to the streets waving EU flags, apparently concerned that their nation’s bid to join the European Union could result in failure.The Georgian parliament is poised to vote on a bill that proposes labeling all political and civil society NGOs that receive over 20% of their funding from overseas “foreign agents.”Critics say the bill is a copy of a Russian law that seeks to identify “foreign agents.” Moscow parliamentarians have accused Western-backed “foreign agents” of using crypto from abroad to fund their activities in Russia.EU Membership Plans in Jeopardy?
An article in the British magazine The Spectator claimed:
“Such a law would [..] dash any hope of Georgia joining the EU. This week, in reaction to the government’s heavy-handed attempts to disperse the protestors, more than 30 members of the European Parliament called on Brussels to withdraw Georgia’s EU membership candidate status.”
The bill has become a political hot potato in Georgia, where President Salome Zourabichvili says she intends to veto the bill.The nation’s parliament, however, has the power to overrule a Zourabichvili veto.Western media commentators have claimed that the result of the vote could “mean revolution” for Georgia.Government officials have claimed the protestors are agitated by Western-backed groups seeking a “revolution.”The SSSG said that the protesters’ goal is to spark violence and “provoke law enforcement agencies.”The agency warned of the danger of “panic, stampedes, serious injuries, and casualties” should the demonstrations continue.Crypto remains popular in Georgia, as does crypto mining. In 2018, the nation began exploring plans to adopt blockchain technology in government operations.

Shiba Doge Hybrid (SHIDOGE) to Skyrocket 8,000% as MEXC Listing Announced, While Shiba Inu and Dogecoin Struggle



                    

Shiba Doge Hybrid (SHIDOGE) could turn early investors into multi-millionaires if it becomes a mainstream coin, like Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE).



Shiba Doge Hybrid (SHIDOGE), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is poised to explode over 8,000% in price in the coming days.




This is because SHIDOGE has announced its first centralized exchange listing, which will be on MEXC.



This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up.



Currently, Shiba Doge Hybrid (SHIDOGE) can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jupiter and Raydium, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days.



Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Shiba Doge Hybrid (SHIDOGE) could become the next viral memecoin.



To buy Shiba Doge Hybrid on Raydium or Jupiter ahead of the MEXC listing, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for SHIDOGE by entering its contract address – 797CmcxqkLZaSjMd7MdyNZ9swuSzaGdYWkJ65jehiXWa – in the receiving field.



In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price.



If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner.




The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum.



This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like SHIDOGE.

If You Invested $1,000 In Bitcoin When Donald Trump Said The Crypto's Value Was 'Based On Thin Air,' Here's How Much You'd Have Now - Benzinga

Former President Donald Trump spoke positively about cryptocurrency during a speech Wednesday, May 8, 2024. The comments from Trump are creating optimism for the crypto market under a potential re-election of Trump in the 2024 presidential election.Trump Flips On Crypto Opinion: While Trump praised the cryptocurrency market during his speech, also saying his campaign would accept crypto for donations and pro-crypto voters should support him, he hasn't always been supportive of cryptocurrency."If you like crypto in any form … if you're in favor of crypto you'd better vote for Trump," the former president said to the crowd on May 8.Trump has been known for being vocal about a number of topics and people over the years, often sharing those opinions on social media platforms. One of the many sectors Trump has been outspoken about is the cryptocurrency sector.In 2019, Trump spoke out about Bitcoin BTC/USD and cryptocurrency."I am not a fan of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, which are not money, and whose value is highly volatile and based on thin air," Trump tweeted on July 11, 2019.Trump also went on to call out Libra, a virtual currency that Meta Platforms Inc META was working on at the time."If Facebook and other companies want to become a bank, they must seek a new Banking Charter and become subject to all Banking Regulations, just like other Banks."Trump said the real currency is the U.S. dollar, which he added would remain the "most dominant currency anywhere in the world."Investing $1,000 in Bitcoin: On the day Trump blasted Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies, the leading cryptocurrency traded between $11,158.92 and $12,144.62.Based on the high of the day, an investor could have purchased 0.0823 BTC at the time of Trump's tweet.That $1,000 investment would be worth $5,138.70 today based on a price of $62,438.61 for Bitcoin at the time of writing. This represents a return of 413.9%.At its peak of $73,750.07 set in March 2024, the investment would have been worth $6,069.63, up 506.9% from the time of Trump's tweet.Related Link: EXCLUSIVE: Cathie Wood Says Bitcoin Is Key 2024 Election Issue For Young VotersWhy It's Important: While he criticized Bitcoin in 2019, Trump would later use the power of cryptocurrency to launch his own non-fungible token collection. Trump has now launched three NFT collections since December 2022. Many on social media were quick to point out the previous comments against cryptocurrency by the former president at the time his NFTs launched.The price of Bitcoin soared in 2023 and 2024, rebounding from a 2022 year that saw a drop in the price due to volatility from the bankruptcies of several cryptocurrency trading platforms.The approval of Bitcoin ETFs in 2024 increased optimism for the crypto sector and helped kick off new all-time highs for Bitcoin months later.Skeptics of Bitcoin such as Trump have been proven wrong over the years with the price of Bitcoin soaring to new highs and gains outpacing other assets.This article was previously published by Benzinga and has been updated.Read Next: If You Invested $1,000 In Meta Platforms Stock When Donald Trump Said Facebook Was Always Anti-Trump, Here’s How Much You’d Have NowPhotos: Shutterstock

How Wall Street scored big in the FTX bankruptcy mess | Cryptopolitan

Wall Street never misses a beat, even in the throes of cryptocurrency chaos. When FTX, once a titan in the crypto exchange world, stumbled into bankruptcy in November 2022, savvy investors from the traditional finance realm were already positioning themselves to profit.Opportunistic Moves Amid CrisisIn the immediate aftermath of FTX’s collapse, the price of claims against the company plummeted, trading for mere pennies on the dollar. Veteran investment firms like Attestor, Farallon, Oaktree, and Silver Point capitalized on the turmoil. These players, accustomed to the high-stakes game of distressed assets, began scooping up claims for as low as 20 cents on the dollar. They wagered on the eventual recovery of FTX’s assets, a bet that would require patience and a keen eye for timing.As the bankruptcy proceedings unfolded, the task at hand was clear: liquidate every asset FTX had touched—from digital tokens to venture capital stakes—and convert them into cash. This massive sell-off coincided with a surge in cryptocurrency values, inflating the returns on these distressed assets. Before long, claims that once seemed nearly worthless were trading close to their full value.Despite the complexity of the situation, including competing claims from government entities like the Department of Justice and the IRS, the restructuring plan moved swiftly. Under the guidance of John Ray III, the newly appointed CEO tasked with navigating the bankruptcy, FTX managed to outline a path to significant recovery for its creditors. The stark contrast to prolonged liquidations of the past, such as those following the Enron and Lehman Brothers scandals, highlighted the efficiency of the process this time around.The Windfall in WaitingPatience paid off handsomely for those who had the foresight to invest in FTX’s beleaguered claims. The total face value of these claims was around $12 billion, but with the assets liquidated and the market rebound, total recoveries are projected to surpass $15 billion. This represents a staggering gain, largely benefiting the few who dared to bet against the tide.Meanwhile, the typical FTX account holders faced mixed emotions. Although the plan proposed a return of 118 cents on the dollar based on the cryptocurrency prices at their lowest in 2022, these individuals missed out on the dramatic price rallies that followed. Their recovery, substantial as it may seem, did not fully capitalize on the market’s upturn.The narrative of FTX’s fall and partial redemption is a testament to Wall Street’s acumen in navigating financial disasters. While the crypto community had heralded platforms like FTX as pioneers of financial democratization, the old guards of finance—armed with experience and capital—were the ones who emerged in a position to dictate terms.Despite the resolution appearing favorable, with almost all small creditors set to recover fully, the larger story is the reminder of traditional finance’s resilience and strategic depth. The swift and strategic actions by investment firms amidst FTX’s collapse illustrate a broader theme: in the world of high finance, timing, and experience often triumph over turmoil.As the final details of the bankruptcy plan await court approval, stakeholders from across the financial spectrum are watching closely. FTX’s saga is far from a solitary event. Rather, it’s a clear indicator of how the financial establishment adapts and thrives, even as the ground changes beneath it.

EigenLayer's EIGEN Airdrop Might Signal Demise of Once-Popular 'Points'

But when it comes to protecting investors and offering transparency, Robert Leshner, the founder of Compound and Robot Ventures, an investor in EigenLayer developer Eigen Labs, thinks points are the worst of all worlds. "The entire root of investor protection is making sure that there's not an information asymmetry between the investors and the sponsors. And points create the largest information asymmetry that exists in crypto," he said. "Everything is at the team's discretion, and users and investors are just praying that they get treated right by the team."

Bitcoin could soon ‘BLOW higher’ on bullish candle hammer: Glassnode execs

Bitcoin (BTC) traders are pointing to a “bullish candle hammer” that has emerged on Bitcoin’s weekly price chart — which they say could signal a possible reversal of the past month’s downtrend.“Bitcoin still looks like it is about to BLOW higher,” market intelligence firm Glassnode founders Jan Happel and Yana Allemann wrote on their shared X account “Negentropic” in a post on May 9. They noted that the Bitcoin price chart closed on May 5 with a bullish hammer — the name given when there is a small body above a thin long line, referred to as a “wick.”“Bitcoin weekly bullish hammer candle…reversal is imminent,” added pseudonymous crypto trader Mister Crypto.Source: Mister CryptoIt could signal a reversal as traders pushed prices down significantly during the 7 days, but buyers managed to aggressively close it near the candle open, suggesting a shift in sentiment.“This week’s pullback hence seems like a healthy correction before higher. Corrections often pull back either 50% or 61.8% of the previous impulse move,” Negentropic said.Pseudonymous crypto trader Rekt Capital explained that long downside wicks have often been key to ending more than 20% corrections for Bitcoin “for the past year and a half,” in a May 9 X post.Bitcoin closed the week ending May 5 at $64,109, as per CoinMarketCap data. A 20% increase from this level would take it beyond its current all-time high, reaching $76,822.At the time of publication, Bitcoin’s price is $62,830.Bitcoin's price is down 8.93% over the last 30 days. Source: CoinMarketCapHowever, crypto trader Mags anticipates that it may come up slightly short of that estimate, though not by much.“If price holds the current levels, the next stop would be a range high of $72,000,” they stated to their 73,300 X followers on May 9.Related: Bitcoin distribution ‘danger zone’ over, analysts sayAlthough this single candle pattern is seen as a bullish signal to traders, most wait for confirmation of the change of direction in the following candle.

Andrew Tate Coin (ANDTATE) Will Explode 16,000% Ahead of MEXC Listing, While Shiba Inu, Bonk and Dogecoin Struggle



                    

Early investors in memecoins like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Bonk (BONK), and Dogecoin (DOGE) made astronomical returns, and Andrew Tate Coin (ANDTATE) presents a similar opportunity for a limited time.



Andrew Tate Coin (ANDTATE), a newly launched Solana memecoin, is poised to explode over 16,000% in a matter of days, as former Shiba Inu (SHIB), Bonk (BONK) and Dogecoin (DOGE) investors pour funds into this new token.




ANDTATE will be listed on MEXC, one of the largest centralized exchanges in the world, within a few days – and this is a massively bullish development for the token, as millions of new investors will easily be able to buy Andrew Tate Coin.



Currently, Andrew Tate Coin can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jupiter and Raydium, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. 



To buy ANDTATE on these platforms, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Andrew Tate Coin by entering its contract address – Cp7qyqdzXAqF7fqKXzS8LwTE7JQvh2V3vYGnDdx6j4ii – in the receiving field.




ANDTATE currently has a market cap of just under $20,000, meaning it has huge upside potential.



Early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and Bonk (BONK) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. 



If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner.

Marathon Digital misses Q1 estimates on bad weather, utility failures

Bitcoin (BTC) miner Marathon Digital missed Wall Street analysts’ revenue estimates in its first quarter 2024 results, blaming bad weather and equipment failures.Marathon’s Q1 revenues increased 223% year-on-year to $165.2 million in results shared on May 9 — but it still missed the $193.9 million estimate from investment analyst firm Zacks by 14.80%.The firm mined 2,811 BTC over the quarter, currently worth $176.7 million, a 28% bump from a year ago but down 34% from the 4,242 BTC mined in Q4 2023.On a May 9 earnings call, Marathon CEO Fred Thiel said its production was marred by “unexpected equipment failures, predominantly transformers that our third-party hosted sites, utility company transmission line maintenance and a higher than anticipated weather-related curtailments across multiple sites.”In its earnings report, Marathon said the bad weather hit its Garden City site in central Texas and “other sites.” It acquired the Texas site on April 2.He added it “mitigated a number of these issues” and was operating at “a record high” of 27 exahashes per second (EH/s)Thiel clung to its expectation that it would ramp up to 50 EH/s by the end of the year which it bumped up in late April from its prior target of 35 to 37 EH/s. The BTC miner’s first-quarter net income was up 184% year-on-year to $337.2 million, a $1.26 earnings per share that topped the $0.02 Zacks estimate.However, its income was boosted by new Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) rules that Marathon adopted allowing it to record the $488.8 million quarterly paper gain it had on the 17,320 BTC it held as of March 31.Related: Digital Currency Group first-quarter revenue jumps 51% despite GBTC outflowsMarathon Digital (MARA) shares closed 2.19% down on May 9 at $19.65 and fell an additional 1% in after-hours trading, according to Google Finance.MARA hit an after-hours session low of $18.60 before recovering to $19.45.

Bitcoin & Ethereum Decouple From Trad Markets, What It Means


								Data shows that Bitcoin and Ethereum correlate little to traditional markets, implying that cryptocurrency is forging its destiny.
Bitcoin & Ethereum Have Been The Master Of Their Fates Recently
According to data from the market intelligence platform IntoTheBlock, the correlation between BTC and ETH with traditional markets and commodities has been close to zero recently.
The “correlation” here refers to the correlation coefficient (r) from statistics, a metric that tracks how connected two quantities have been over a given period.

When the value of this metric is greater than zero for any two assets, it means that there exists some positive correlation between their prices, implying that the assets are moving in tandem. The closer this value is to 1, the tighter the relationship.
On the other hand, the indicator’s negative value suggests that while there is some correlation between the two, it’s a negative one, as the price of one asset reacts to movements in the other by moving oppositely to it. In this case, the extreme where the correlation is the strongest is -1.
The correlation coefficient standing at or near zero suggests no relationship between the assets. In statistics, the variables are said to be independent in this case.
Now, here is a table that shows how the 30-day correlation between the two largest cryptocurrencies by market cap, Bitcoin and Ethereum, looks like against some of the traditional assets:

The data for the correlation matrix of BTC and ETH | Source: IntoTheBlock on X
As is visible above, Bitcoin and Ethereum have appeared to have a low correlation to these assets over the past month. Out of these, the coins are the most correlated to the S&P 500, with the coefficient standing at 0.4 for BTC and 0.49 for ETH.
Thus, this would mean that ETH is slightly more correlated to the S&P 500 than BTC. Like this, ETH also has a more prominent relationship with the others on the list compared to BTC, although it’s still not strongly correlated to any of them.
The low correlation coefficient with the traditional markets suggests that cryptocurrencies have been running more or less independently in the past month.

Generally, correlation can be something to watch when an investor is looking to add an asset to their portfolio. Assets that have a high correlation make up for poor diversifying options, as they would either mimic a similar performance (positive coefficient) or counteract each other (negative coefficient).
Since Bitcoin and Ethereum lack any solid correlation to traditional markets and commodities, the two coins may be viable options for traditional investors to add to their portfolios.

BlockFi to shut down web platform, turn to Coinbase as distribution partner

Bankrupt crypto lender BlockFi said on May 9 that it would shut down its web platform by the end of May and rely primarily on Coinbase as a distribution partner.The change ensures that BlockFi Interest Account (BIA), Retail Loan, and Private Clients can continue to access withdrawals as part of the bankruptcy claims process.Crypto-eligible customers will be able to access funds in kind if they have an open or approved Coinbase account. The condition applies to crypto-eligible customers who did not withdraw crypto from BlockFi’s web platform by April 28 or did not verify their identity by May 10.Crypto-eligible customers who do not create a Coinbase account or cannot create one will instead receive funds in cash.BlockFi emphasized that it has not partnered with any other crypto companies for distributions and warned users of scams from bad actors claiming otherwise.BlockFi and Coinbase will contact users who are on file with instructions.BlockFi’s FTX fundsThe plan administrator in BlockFi’s bankruptcy case may perform future distributions through Coinbase, including those related to funds recovered from FTX.BlockFi was expected to receive nearly $875 million from FTX as of March. Only the first $250 million is prioritized, while the remainder depends on FTX’s ability to pay customers in its own case.BlockFi said that, without Coinbase’s involvement, the plan administrator would only be able to make cash distributions rather than crypto distributions going forward.BlockFi originally filed for halted withdrawals on Nov. 10, 2022, citing a “lack of clarity” around FTX’s separate bankruptcy as the reason for its own shutdown. Weeks later, BlockFi entered bankruptcy proceedings that revealed FTX as its second-largest creditor.BlockFi emerged from bankruptcy in October 2023 and began to pay users this year. FTX remains in bankruptcy proceedings.Mentioned in this articlePosted In: US, Bankruptcy

Grayscale Battling Outflows And Lower-Cost ETFs, Q1 Revenue Stays Flat At $156M


																Grayscale Investments, the issuer of one of the recently approved spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) in the US, saw flat revenues in the first quarter of the year due to its decision to maintain fees on its flagship Grayscale Bitcoin Trust ETF (GBTC). 
Grayscale Exceeds Expectations Despite Outflows
According to a shareholder letter from its parent company, Digital Currency Group (DCG), the operator of the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust recorded $156 million in revenue, showing little change from the previous quarter.

	Related Reading



Since the GBTC trust’s conversion to an ETF in January, Grayscale has seen outflows of about $17.4 billion as investors appear to have shifted their assets to new, lower-cost funds offered by BlackRock and Fidelity, the leaders in the US ETF race in terms of inflows recorded since January. 
While GBTC charges a 1.5% management fee, many of its competitors charge less than 0.3%, leading to outflows. In response, Grayscale announced plans in March to seek approval from the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to spin off some of Grayscale’s assets into a new, lower-fee “Bitcoin Mini Trust.” 
Despite the outflows, the Q1 revenue attributable to GBTC exceeded Grayscale’s expectations. The firm had previously anticipated outflows due to increased competition under the ETF wrapper. Grayscale previously charged a 2% sponsorship fee before the trust was converted. 
The flat revenue was also attributed to higher average Bitcoin and Ethereum prices and a decrease in assets under management (AUM).
In contrast to Grayscale’s performance, all US spot Bitcoin ETFs have witnessed a total net inflow of over $11 billion thus far. However, demand for these ETFs has recently declined amidst tightening financial conditions in the US, where the Federal Reserve (Fed) faces the challenge of addressing persistent inflation.
DCG Reports 11% Q1 Revenue Increase
Digital Currency Group, founded by Barry Silbert and the parent company of Grayscale, reported an 11% quarter-over-quarter increase in Q1 revenue to $229 million, primarily due to higher asset prices. 
However, revenue growth lagged behind Bitcoin’s price appreciation, which rose more than 60% during the same period. In its letter, DCG attributed this disparity to lower GBTC sponsor fees, redemptions, and steady mining revenues at its Foundry subsidiary.

Foundry, DCG’s mining subsidiary, experienced a sequential revenue increase of 35%, propelled by staking and equipment sales revenue. Meanwhile, Luno, the company’s crypto exchange subsidiary, witnessed a 46% quarter-over-quarter sales boost, driven by a significant surge in trading volume.

Australia’s Tax Office Targets 1.2 Million Crypto Users in Compliance Crackdown



                    

Australia’s tax authorities are stepping up their efforts to address tax compliance among cryptocurrency users, reflecting a global trend towards stricter regulation of digital assets.



The Australian Taxation Office (ATO) is seeking detailed personal and transaction data from up to 1.2 million users of cryptocurrency exchanges. 




This initiative is part of a broader attempt to identify those who may have skirted tax obligations on their crypto trades, as detailed in a notice issued last month, which was obtained by Reuters.



The ATO’s data request includes not only basic identity information like users’ birth dates, but also extends to their social media accounts, phone numbers, and financial particulars such as wallet addresses, the types of coins traded, and associated bank account details. 



The notice explains that cryptocurrencies, unlike traditional foreign currencies, are considered taxable assets in Australia. 




This classification means that profits from cryptocurrency sales are subject to capital gains tax.



This move by the ATO coincides with significant profits in the cryptocurrency markets, highlighted by substantial increases in the values of major cryptocurrencies. 



Bitcoin, for instance, has seen a 44% increase since the start of the year, while Ether’s value has risen by 32%. 



Additionally, the market capitalization of other significant altcoins (excluding Bitcoin and Ether) has climbed over 27%, according to TradingView.




READ MORE: Bullish Momentum Looms: Bitcoin’s Price Eyeing Upsurge on Inverse Head-and-Shoulders Confirmation



The ATO notice points to the potential for using cryptocurrencies for tax evasion due to the possibility of purchasing crypto assets under false identities. 



This concern is not isolated to Australia, as similar regulatory actions are taking place globally. 



For example, the Canada Revenue Agency’s compliance branch director general, Sahil Behal, disclosed that the agency is conducting over 400 crypto-related audits and investigating numerous crypto investors to recover unpaid taxes. 



This action builds on the discovery of an estimated $39.5 million in unpaid taxes from the 2023-2024 fiscal year.



In Turkey, upcoming legislation expected later this year aims to establish a legal framework for taxing cryptocurrencies, recognizing the country’s position as a significant player in the crypto economy. 



Meanwhile, in the United States, there are proposals to increase the long-term capital gains tax rate to 44.6% for high earners, alongside a potential 25% tax on unrealized gains for extremely wealthy individuals. 



According to Matthew Walrath, founder of Crypto Tax Made Easy, despite these stringent proposals, they are unlikely to affect the vast majority of people, describing them as “a big, fat nothing burger” since they are still merely proposals.

Bitcoin’s Ordinals, Runes key to solving the mining subsidy problem: ViaBTC

Bitcoin transaction fees from applications such as Ordinals, Runes and BRC-20s will be key to making sure miners stick around even as more halving events occur, according to a cryptocurrency mining pool.“[The Bitcoin network’s] evolution has led to an expanding array of use cases and a growing user base [which] has significantly impacted miners’ fee income from on-chain transactions,” ViaBTC told Cointelegraph in a recent interview.Prior to the Ordinals protocol’s launch in January 2023, miners relied on peer-to-peer transaction fees to accompany the block subsidy — which halves every 210,000 blocks and thus has an “indisputable” impact on miners’ revenue over the long haul, ViaBTC said.Mining revenue can also increase with a rise in Bitcoin’s (BTC) price, but further development at the application layer will increase network activity, broaden its utility and thereby compensate miners handsomely, ViaBTC explained.ViaBTC experienced this first hand on April 20 when it mined the highly sought-after halving block, at block 840,000, which came with a record-setting 37.6 BTC transaction fee — worth $2.4 million at the time.The reward, which totaled 40.7 BTC when factoring in the new 3.125 BTC block subsidy, came from memecoin and nonfungible token enthusiasts competing to inscribe “rare satoshis” and fungible tokens via the new Runes token standard, which launched at the halving block. Source: 10x ResearchViaBTC told Cointelegraph it had a “premonition” that transaction fees would eventually break the 30, 40, 50 BTC barrier but didn’t expect they would be the beneficiaries of such a massive reward — let alone at the halving block. While Bitcoin miners cashed in an eye-popping $78.3 million on halving day, they’ve also made more from fees than Ethereum stakers and Uniswap liquidity providers in nine of the last 20 days since the halving, according to Crypto Fees.Fees by blockchains and protocols on April 20. Source: Crypto FeesBitcoin’s pseudonymous creator, Satoshi Nakamoto, predicted that transaction fees would eventually become miners’ main compensation source as the block subsidy halves, ViaBTC noted.Related: Bitcoin post-halving price consolidation could last 2 months — Bitfinex“If these transactions find broader utility in the future and make significant technological advancements, they may garner increased attention and recognition,” ViaBTC added.However, Ordinals inscriptions, Runes and BRC-20s have seen several rises and falls in popularity since each protocol launched, which has brought about some instability in miner revenue.ViaBTC has endured three halving events since it started operating in 2016, with block 840,000 being the 37,534th block that it had mined in its 2,900-day existence.The mining pool’s hash rate is sourced from miners in 118 countries.Magazine: 68% of Runes are in the red — Are they really an upgrade for Bitcoin?

								One of the issuers of spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) in the US, WisdomTree, has announced the expansion of its WisdomTree Prime app to users in New York. 

Expanded Custody And Stablecoin Services
This development closely follows WisdomTree’s recent achievement of a New York State Department of Financial Services (DFS) charter, granting the company the status of a limited-purpose trust company under the New York Banking Law. 
This charter enables the asset manager to custody digital assets, including offering digital wallet services, issuing and exchanging DFS-approved stablecoins, and managing stablecoin reserves through its newly established entity, WisdomTree Digital Trust Company.
According to the asset manager’s announcement, the trust charter and added authorities enable WisdomTree Digital Trust Company to provide increased customer protection, particularly regarding asset safekeeping. 
WisdomTree Prime App And Visa Debit Card Make Joint Debut In NY
The launch of the WisdomTree Prime app in New York coincides with the recent introduction of the WisdomTree Prime Visa Debit Card issued by Stride Bank. 
According to the Bitcoin ETF issuer, this card will allow users to purchase with their available wallet balance wherever Visa is accepted, effectively bridging personal finance and digital asset investing. 

Will Peck, Head of Digital Assets at WisdomTree, expressed his excitement about the company’s accomplishments:
Since our initial entry into select states’ app stores last summer, we have gained significant momentum across various fronts, including the launch of new digital funds, payment capabilities, and collaborations with regulators like the New York State Department of Financial Services. Our aim is to empower consumers in utilizing digital assets in their everyday financial lives. We are excited to provide retail investors in New York with access to the app, as we recognize the rapid growth of the digital asset market in this region, which we expect to be highly influential for WisdomTree Prime.
In addition to New York, WisdomTree Prime has gone live in several other states, including Connecticut, Delaware, Idaho, Louisiana, Maine, Nevada, and Ohio, bringing the total number of states in which it is available to 41.

Tether slams Deutsche Bank over suggestion its stablecoin could fail

Stablecoin giant Tether has slammed Deutsche Bank over a newly released report suggesting that stablecoins — including its dollar-pegged token Tether (USDT) — could witness a “peso moment,” that would wreak havoc on the crypto industry. In a May 7 research report on stablecoins, Deutsche analysts cited the 2022 collapse of the Terraform Lab’s algorithmic stablecoin TerraUSD (TUSD) which saw at least $40 billion wiped from the market in a few days, as cause for wider criticism of dollar-pegged stablecoin products.From a study of 334 currency pegs from the last 223 years, analysts found that 49% of fixed currencies failed over the course of their median life span of approximately eight to ten years. 42% of European consumers believed stablecoins would fail eventually. Source: Deutsche BankThe analysts concluded that most of the pegged assets in the crypto space will experience significant “turbulence” stemming from speculative sentiment and eventually suffer some kind of de-pegging event. “While some may survive, most will likely fail, particularly due to the lack of transparency in stablecoin operations and vulnerability to speculative sentiment.”Deutsche analysts also noted Tether’s lack of transparency concerning its reserves and described the firm’s solvency status as “questionable.”However, Tether lashed out at Deutsche’s report, saying it “lacks clarity and substantial evidence” and relies on “vague assertions rather than rigorous analysis.”In comments shared with Cointelegraph, a Tether spokesperson said that while the report attempts to forecast the decline of stablecoins, it failed to “provide concrete data to support its claims.”“Moreover, its comparison to Terra, an algorithmic stablecoin, is misleading and irrelevant to the discussion on reserve-backed coins,” said Tether in response. “Questioning the credibility of any financial institution, especially one with Deutsche Bank's track record, seems ironic. Deutsche Bank's history of fines and penalties raises doubts about its own standing to critique others in the industry.”Related: Tokenizing money is the ‘greatest innovation’ after fiat — Tether co-founderTether has been the subject of criticism over the transparency of its reserves.However, the firm has released several financial attestations, which suggest the firm holds over $110 billion in fiat-denominated reserves — though some critics argue it’s not the same as a financial audit. Audits are conducted to look at data, risks, or compliance issues that may not have been known before the audit took place while an attestation is a more simple tool used to take a snapshot of certain data. In 2021, the New York Attorney General settled with Tether to pay an $18.5 million fine and barred it from practicing in the state for allegedly misrepresenting the degree to which its reserves were backed fiat collateral. Despite never releasing an official audit since the firm’s inception in 2014, Cantor Fitzgerald CEO Howard Lutnick says he believes Tether “has the money,” on hand.

Coinbase's Hidden Gem: Analysts See ‘Amazon-like’ Potential in Layer-2 Network Base | Cryptoglobe


                                
Cryptocurrency asset manager Bitwise has recently shared analysis on the Nasdaq-listed cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase (NASDAQ: COIN), suggesting it could be in a similar position to Amazon before it exploded and became a near $2 trillion company.



According to Bitwise’s analysis there’s a “game-changer hidden in Coinbase’s recent earnings report,” namely its Ethereum layer-2 network Base that allows users to move funds on Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) compatible decentralized applications for next to no cost.



Coinbase reported net revenue of $1.6 billion in the first quarter of the year, seeing a rise of 72% quarter-on-quarter and 116% year-over-year, beating analyst estimates of $1.36 billion. Its trading revenue, on a quarter-on-quarter basis, rose 93%, while institutional trading revenue rose 105% and stablecoin revenue 15%.



Its blockchain rewards revenue rose 59% over the same period, with the firm’s total profits hitting $1.2 billion while total cash on hand rose to $7.1 billion. To Bitwise’s analysts, a “little-noticed crypto-native business line” they believe could be a game changer is Base itself, which account for 1% of the firm’s revenues in the first quarter.







They noted that when “something is much cheaper, faster, and easier to use, people are going to use more of it,” and added Base is the “fastest-growing Layer 2, with transactions rising 74% quarter-over-quarter in Q1.” Base, they added, processed 40% more transactions in April alone than in the whole first quarter, while Coinbase’s CEO Brian Armstrong said the number of developers on it is surging.



As a result, Bitwise added, Base could be a “massive revenue generator for Coinbase, with extremely high gross margins.” Coinbase is a “sequencer” verifying transactions on the Layer-2 network, which batches them before posting them to the Ethereum mainnet.







            
            

            
            

            
            

        

Coinbase is the only sequencer on Base for now and as a result pocketed $15.5 million in fees in the first quarter of the year, out of $27.4 million Base users paid in transaction fees to use the network. In April, those fees accounted for $11 million of Coinbase’s revenue.



The analysts added:



If Base continues to grow, it could reliably deliver $10 million, $20 million, or more in profit to Coinbase each month. In the longer term, if Base becomes the primary network on which developers build applications, Coinbase could end up owning a core piece of crypto infrastructure. 



Bitwise further noted that some noted “this could put Coinbase in a similar position to Amazon,” as Amazon started off with selling books online before expanding, and now over half of its profits come from its cloud computing service Amazon Web Services.



Similarly, Coinbase could become a core infrastructure provider within the cryptocurrency ecosystem.

Latest Bitcoin Top Is Different From 2021 Peak, Analyst Explains Why


																An analyst has explained why the recent high in Bitcoin has experienced different market conditions than those observed during the 2021 bull run peak.
Bitcoin Liquidations Have Been Short-Dominated In Recent Market High
In a new post on X, on-chain analyst Checkmate pointed out how the latest 2024 high achieved following the spot exchange-traded fund (ETF) inflows has a major difference when compared to the 2021 peak.

	Related Reading



The difference lies in the trend registered on derivatives markets. Below is the chart shared by the analyst that shows the trend in the dominance of long liquidations in the sector over the last few years.

The distribution of liquidations on derivatives market over the last few years | Source: @_Checkmatey_ on X
“Liquidation” here naturally refers to the act of forceful closure that any derivatives market contract undergoes on an exchange when it accumulates losses of a certain degree.
The risk of a contract getting liquidated becomes higher, and the more volatile the asset price gets. During sharp rallies and crashes, huge amounts of liquidation can pile up in the market.
From the chart, it’s visible that as the rally in the cryptocurrency had occurred this year, the short holders had been taking a beating. This was only natural as surges pile up losses for these investors betting on a decline, so price growth as rapid as the one witnessed would have pushed many of these contracts toward liquidation.
Interestingly, the scale of the short dominance maintained throughout the run, implying that the investors didn’t quite believe the run would continue any further at every point of the rally, so they bet against it.
This has also remained true in the recent stagnation following the top, as short liquidations have outweighed the long ones even though the price has decreased.
As is apparent in the graph, the 2021 peaks saw a different trend. Longs were getting liquidated as Bitcoin topped out during both the first half of the 2021 peak and the second half.
In those periods, the investors had become too greedy and were only betting on the rise to continue even when the asset had slowed down. This greed appears to haven’t overtaken the market in the bull run.
While the current Bitcoin rally differs from the last one in this metric, analyst Maartunn has pointed out in an X post another indicator where the trend appears to be similar to that observed in previous peaks.

Looks like the value of the metric has been plunging in recent days | Source: @JA_Maartun on X
This indicator is the Coin Days Destroyed (CDD), which basically tells us about the scale of dormant coin movement that’s happening in the market right now. It would appear that this metric had attained very high levels recently.

“Coin Days Destroyed has probably peaked,” says Maartunn. “Bitcoin’s price typically reaches its peak around the same time.” It should be noted that although this has been true for some of the tops, the 2021 peak took months to form after the metric peaked.

At the time of writing, Bitcoin is floating around $62,200, up more than 5% over the past week.

US House Opposes SEC’s Crypto Policy With New Resolution


								The US House of Representatives has voted for a resolution to overturn the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC)’s 2022 bulletin on crypto custodian accounting.
US President Joe Biden released a statement opposing the resolution and revealing a possible veto if the bill passes the Senate.

Democrats And Republicans Join Forces Against The SEC
On May 8, 21 Democrat House Representatives joined 207 Republican Representatives to vote in favor of H.J.Res.109 to nullify the Staff Accounting Bulletin (SAB) 121. The bulletin requires all custodians of cryptocurrencies and other digital assets to recognize these assets as a liability in their accounting books.
As reported by Bitcoinist, the rule has prevented US banks from holding Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies as it made their crypto business “non-viable.” Republican Congressman Mike Flood argued that “the SEC’s accounting standards for firms that custody crypto are unfair and hinder banks looking to provide such services.”


Wednesday’s vote was passed with 228 representatives in favor and 182 opposing it. The bill now awaits the Senate’s vote to be passed to the President’s desk. If approved, the resolution would allow financial institutions to hold Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies under viable requirements.
Fox Business Journalist Elizabeth Terret asserted that the bipartisan decision saw a “larger number of supporting House Democrats than expected.” However, the journalist considers that the bill “likely won’t pass the Senate or the President’s desk.”
SAB 121 has been greatly criticized by important figures like Patrick McHenry, the Chairman of the Financial Services Committee.
On Wednesday, the Committee’s Chair called the bulletin “one of the most glaring examples of the regulatory overreach that has defined Gary Gensler’s tenure at the SEC.” During his speech on the House floor, Chair McHenry remarked his support for the resolution, stating:

This bipartisan resolution is an essential effort to protect consumers and foster innovation in digital asset markets. It’s also critical to stop the SEC’s regulatory power grabs and efforts to circumvent the Administrative Procedure Act.

Senator Cynthia Lummis has also expressed disagreement with the “unnecessary” SAB 121 rule on different occasions. On May 1, the pro-crypto senator criticized the US government’s “overreach” on the industry, revealing her concerns over the Department of Justice (DOJ) “hyper-aggressive” arguments against the sector.
President Biden In Favor Of SEC’s Crypto Crackdown
After the news of the favorable vote by the US House Representatives, the White House addressed the matter. According to the statement, Biden’s administration “strongly opposes” the resolution’s passage.

The president considers the bill “disruptive” against the SEC’s “work to protect investors in crypto-asset markets and to safeguard the broader financial system.”
Moreover, the statement claims that the SEC’s ability to ensure appropriate regulations in the future could be “constrained” by invoking the Congressional Review Act.
The White House considers that “limiting” the SEC’s ability to regulate digital assets “would introduce substantial financial instability and market uncertainty.” Ultimately, the statement affirms that President Biden would veto the resolution if passed by the Senate.

                        Bitcoin mining firm Marathon Digital reportedly battled against “operational challenges” to produce record financial results in the first quarter of 2024.In its first-quarter earnings report, the firm reported producing 2,811 Bitcoins during the first quarter of 2024, compared to 4,242 in the last quarter of 2023, a decline of 33.73%.Marathon Digital reported revenues increased 223% to $165.2 million in the first quarter of 2024 from $51.1 million in the first quarter of 2023. The firms’ energized hash rate which measures the computational power of a blockchain network, increased 142% to 27.8 EH/s in the first quarter of 2024 from 11.5 EH/s in the first quarter of 2023.Marathon Digital shared trading under the ticker “MARA” were down 2.19% at $19.56 at market close on Thursday.“During the first quarter of 2024, we doubled the size of our portfolio of digital asset compute, launched our first products and services to support the Bitcoin ecosystem, and we battled against operational challenges to produce record financial results,” said Fred Thiel, Marathon’s chairman and chief executive officer, a press release.Thiel explained in less than four months the mining firm initiated, closed, and integrated the acquisitions of its first three sites. Due to this, the firm doubled the size of its portfolio to 1.1 gigawatts of capacity, 54% of which is directly owned and operated by Marathon Digital.The firm said it had secured its first paying customers for MARA firmware and began building a sales pipeline for its two-phase immersion system.
HODL Strategy Helps Firm Gain Momentum
“Despite the operational challenges we faced in the first quarter, we were able to leverage our agility to redistribute equipment to newly acquired sites amidst ongoing repairs,” said Thiel. “When combined with our HODL strategy, these actions allowed us to capitalize on Bitcoin’s positive momentum and produce record financial results for the quarter,” added Thiel.The firm went on to grow its topline to $165.2 million, improved net income to a record $337.2 million, and generated adjusted EBITDA of $528.8 million.
Mining Companies Experience Production Decline
Earlier this year, several public mining companies reported decreases in Bitcoin production ranging from 6% to 12% for April following the halving event. Major Bitcoin miners, including Bitfarms, Cipher, CleanSpark, Core Scientific, Riot, and Terawulf, were all affected, according to a report from The Miner Mag.However, the report said that the robust Bitcoin fee market briefly mitigated the impact of the halving on these companies. Hut 8, one of the prominent Bitcoin mining companies in North America, has reported a significant decline in its proprietary production for April. In their monthly update released on Monday, Hut 8 disclosed that they mined 148 BTC with their proprietary mining fleet during April, marking a 36% decrease compared to March.

Solana NFTs: Traders surge 111%, but sales are down - Why? - AMBCrypto



The number of NFT traders on Solana recently rallied to a multi-month high.
The steady decline in SOL’s price has led to a fall in NFT sales volume.

The daily count of non-fungible token [NFT] traders on Solana [SOL] climbed to a multi-month high on the 8th of May, data from CryptoSlam showed.
According to the NFT data tracker, 123,426 traders executed the sale of at least one Solana-based NFT on that day. This marked a 111% rally from the 58,405 NFT traders on the network recorded the previous day.
Source: CryptoSlam
However, despite the surge in NFT traders count, NFT sales volume on Solana cratered by 16% on the 8th of May. That day, the USD value of all Solana-based NFTs sold was $3.01 million. 
On the 7th of May, it was above $3.5 million.
This decline in sales volume is due to the steady decline in SOL’s value in the past few days. According to CoinMarketCap’s data, the coin’s value fell by 7% between the 7th and the 8th of May. 
At press time, SOL traded at $143.04. 
While a decline in SOL’s price can make minting and buying NFTs on Solana more affordable, it might not translate to the same total spending as before.
Also, with SOL’s low price action, investors who bought SOL-based NFTs for potential appreciation in SOL’s value might become hesitant to sell.
 This could lead to fewer high-value NFT purchases, impacting the overall sales volume.
State of the NFT market
An assessment of the performance of the general NFT ecosystem revealed a decline in the past 30 days, mirroring the downtrend in the general cryptocurrency market. 
According to CoinGecko’s data, global cryptocurrency market capitalization has plunged by 15% in the last month. At press time, this was $2.4 trillion.
According to NFTGo’s data, NFT sales volume during that period totaled $488 million and declined by 29%.
Due to the decline in trading activity, NFT market capitalization plummeted. At $17.28 billion at press time, this dropped by 15 % in the past 30 days.

During that period, the NFT trader count fell by 9.5%.
Per NFTGo’s data, the total number of unique addresses that bought or sold at least one NFT from any of the NFT collections tracked over the last month was 107,000.

Sui's zkLogin Now Adds Multi-signature Recovery And Support For Apple Accounts - Coincu



	

Key Points:




Sui’s zkLogin introduces multi-signature recovery and Apple account support, enhancing user options and account recovery capabilities.



The integration of multi-signature recovery improves account recoverability.



These updates reflect Sui’s commitment to simplifying Web3 adoption and bridging the gap for non-crypto users.




Sui Foundation, in a recent announcement on its official blog, unveiled two significant enhancements to its social login basic tool, zkLogin. 





Sui’s zkLogin Introduces Multi-Signature Support



The updates include multi-signature recovery and support for Apple accounts, providing users with expanded options and improved account recovery mechanisms.



Initially introduced last year with support for Google, Twitch, and Facebook accounts, the integration with Apple of Sui’s zkLogin offers users the convenience of consolidating all their social logins under one platform, particularly beneficial for iOS users seeking seamless integration with Sui wallet creation within iPhone applications.



The introduction of multi-signature (multi-sig) recovery presents a novel approach to account recovery, prioritizing both security and user accessibility. With zkLogin’s reliance on the application client ID and issuer, such as Google, multi-sig significantly enhances account recoverability, ensuring users can regain access even if the original application or credential issuer becomes inactive.




Sui Foundation’s Commitment to Web3



Sui’s concerted efforts to onboard new users to Web3 align with the platform’s mission to bridge the gap between traditional and decentralized technologies. Recognizing the challenge faced by both Sui and other Web3 companies in retaining non-crypto users during initial platform access, Sui’s zkLogin marks a pivotal step towards enhancing user confidence and usability within the Web3 ecosystem.



Through the creation of a multi-sig wallet with zkLogin and an additional private key backup, users can maintain access to their assets in the event of app or credential issuer discontinuation. Moreover, the integration of multi-sig with zkLogin facilitates more intricate use cases, enabling builders to incorporate up to 10 zkLogin accounts from various credential providers with customizable weights and thresholds, thereby expanding the tool’s versatility and utility.

BlockFi Shut Down Will Take Place In May, Users Need To Withdraw Asset Before April 28 - Coincu



	

Key Points:




BlockFi shut down will take place at the end of May, and Coinbase will be reliant on it for distribution.



Clients who missed withdrawal deadlines will have their crypto holdings transferred to Coinbase instead of being liquidated to cash.



The partnership ensures continued access to crypto assets, with BlockFi highlighting Coinbase’s involvement as crucial for facilitating future crypto distributions.




BlockFi, a crypto lender undergoing liquidation, has announced plans to close its web platform by the end of May 2024.





BlockFi Shut Down Will Take Place in Partnership with Coinbase for Distribution



In a bid to facilitate the withdrawal process for its clients, BlockFi will be teaming up with Coinbase, a leading cryptocurrency exchange, as its primary distribution partner.



BlockFi shut down comes as part of its bankruptcy proceedings, ensuring that clients with BlockFi Interest Accounts (BIAs), retail loans, and private accounts can still access their funds. Eligible customers who have not withdrawn their crypto holdings by April 28 or completed identity verification by May 10 will have their assets transferred to Coinbase instead of being liquidated to cash.



Continued Access to Crypto Assets Through The Partnership



Clients will have the option to access their funds in kind through their existing or newly created Coinbase accounts. Those unable to create a Coinbase account will receive their funds in cash. BlockFi has emphasized that it has not partnered with any other crypto companies for distributions and warns users of potential scams.




The partnership between BlockFi and Coinbase aims to enable seamless access to crypto holdings during BlockFi shut down. Instructions will be provided to users by both companies, with future distributions potentially facilitated through Coinbase by the plan administrator in BlockFi’s bankruptcy case.

Starknet Foundation Launches $5 Million Seed Grants Program to Boost Final-Stage Blockchain Projects



                    

The Starknet Foundation recently unveiled a significant $5 million Seed Grants Program, designated in USDC, to propel the development of nascent projects on its network. 



This initiative is set to provide vital financial backing to at least 200 emerging teams, each receiving $25,000. 




The focus is on aiding projects in their final stages, helping them overcome the “last mile” challenge to successfully launch on Starknet. 



Starknet operates as an Ethereum layer-2 scaling solution employing zero-knowledge rollup technology, which has been gaining traction among developers.



Diego Oliva, CEO of the Starknet Foundation, emphasized the rationale behind this substantial financial commitment. 




He explained, “We’ve been listening carefully to devs [developers] and hearing about the main challenges they face. 



“We are talking about people with amazing creativity and vision who need support with that ever-hard ‘last mile’ to get a project over the line and into production. 



“So we responded with this program, which is intended, very directly and with minimal bureaucracy, to address this.” 



This quote highlights the foundation’s strategic approach to foster a robust development environment and streamline project completion.

Tether Criticizes Deutsche Bank’s Research on Stablecoins


							

Deutsche Bank Research analysts recently released a paper on stablecoins launched since 1800.



The analysts conclude that most pegged coins failed, with only 14% surviving.



Tether criticizes the researchers, claiming they failed to produce concrete data to support their arguments.




In a recent study, Deutsche Bank Research analysts concluded that most stablecoins failed, with only 14% surviving. Raising concerns regarding the future of stablecoins, the researchers posited, “Some may survive, although most will likely fail.”



Stablecoins are digital currencies pegged to another asset like fiat currency, gold, etc. As these types of currencies are stable, most investors depend on them in the highly volatile crypto market.









The analysts surveyed nearly 334 pegged currencies launched since 1800. They asserted that only a very few currently exist among the total stablecoins. They added that the successful stablecoins boasted three features that the failed stablecoins lacked: credibility, reserve backing, and tightly controlled systems.



As per the research, 49% of the stablecoins failed, existing only for 8 to 10 years. The analysts argued that “macroeconomic factors are key to determining a peg sustainability.” Marion Laboure, Senior Strategist at Deutsche Bank Research, stated, “Issues around governance and speculative forces could also indicate when there’s a possibility of de-pegging.” He added,




 “We chose to compare stablecoins to peg currencies because historically their similarities make them a close proxy as both are pegged currencies. Both require ample reserves and credibility from issuers, are exposed to speculative forces, and the majority of both stablecoins and historical currency pegs track the USD.” 




However, Tether, the issuer of stablecoin giant USDT, raised its voice against the Deutsche Bank Research report, claiming that the analysts failed to produce “concrete data” supporting their arguments. While the researchers pinpointed Terraform Labs’ TerraUSD as an example of the fall of stablecoins, Tether commented, “Its comparison to Terra, an algorithmic stablecoin, is misleading and irrelevant to the discussion on reserve-backed coins.”

                        Embattled crypto lender BlockFi announced Thursday that it plans to close its web platform this month, and is partnering with Coinbase to distribute funds to clients.The New Jersey-based firm said its Coinbase partnership will allow eligible BlockFi Interest Account, Retail Loan, and Private Clients to withdraw their crypto holdings.BlockFi filed for bankruptcy in Nov. 2022 after FTX’s collapse. CEO Zac Prince, who testified as a government witness in Bankman-Fried’s criminal trial, claims the FTX founder’s actions directly caused BlockFi’s bankruptcy.
Missed BlockFi’s Withdrawal Deadline? You Can Still Recover Your Crypto
In 2023, BlockFi announced it was shutting down and planned to return customers’ crypto holdings. The deadline for most customers to request withdrawals was April 28, 2024.On Thursday, the lender told clients that since the deadline to withdraw their digital assets from the current estate distribution has passed, clients will receive instructions on how to set up a Coinbase account. Through this method, they can withdraw their digital assets if they have an existing or new approved Coinbase account.The company is also giving another chance to those who missed the withdrawal deadline. They will still have the option to withdraw from BlockFi’s platform. Those who do not establish an approved Coinbase account may have their assets liquidated into cash and distributed to them accordingly.
BlockFi Tells Customers To Download Important Documents Before Platform Closure
The plan administrator will have the power to use Coinbase for upcoming distribution rounds, which may involve distributions from recovered funds from FTX. Without this capability, the administrator would be limited to distributing cash for subsequent distributions.BlockFi said it does not plan to collaborate with any additional providers for cryptocurrency distributions. Consequently, it cautioned investors to remain vigilant against potential scam attempts from third-party entities. BlockFi has previously been the target of fraudulent activity, where claimants received deceptive emails resembling legitimate communications, falsely promising immediate withdrawals of their remaining balances.Customers were further encouraged to retrieve their transaction history, tax documents, and any other pertinent information from BlockFi before the shutdown occurs.

                        An attacker involved in a $68 million address poisoning scam has exhibited a gesture of goodwill by returning $153,000 worth of Ether to the victim.The address-poisoning attack initially saw the attacker tricking a user into transferring $68 million worth of Wrapped Bitcoin (WBTC), which has taken a new twist with the recent kind-hearted act of returning a fraction of the stolen funds.
Attacker Expressed Willingness To Negotiate
The attacker, operating under the alias “FakePhishing327990” on Etherscan, sent $153,000 Ether to the victim, accompanied by a message expressing willingness to negotiate and seeking communication via Telegram.The Victim contacting the address poisoning attacker Source: EtherscanBlockchain data reveals that the victim, identified by their account ending in 8fD5, initiated communication with the attacker. The victim proposed a resolution in which the attacker would return 90% of the stolen funds in exchange for a 10% bounty and a commitment to refrain from legal action. The victim emphasized the inevitability of tracing the funds and provided a deadline for the decision.Subsequently, another account controlled by the attacker, ending in 72F1, responded by sending 51 Ether to the victim. This symbolized a fraction of the stolen funds returned as a demonstration of goodwill. The accompanying message reiterated the attacker’s willingness to negotiate and requested the victim’s Telegram username for further communication.The negotiation unfolds against the address poisoning scam, in which the attacker utilizes a smart contract to deceive the victim into transferring 1,155 WBTC by exploiting the appearance of similarity between addresses.This sophisticated tactic, known as an “address poisoning attack,” involves spamming victims with transactions that mimic their own, ultimately leading to costly errors. Security experts caution users to scrutinize transaction details meticulously, particularly the sending address, to mitigate the risks associated with such attacks.
Phishing Attacks On Rise
An NFT trader recently fell victim to a phishing scam, losing over $145,000 worth of tokens. The trader, known as “tatis.eth,” was targeted by an attacker named “PinkDrainer,” who stole three valuable BAYC NFTs from the victim’s wallet.BAYC, short for Bored Ape Yacht Club, is a collection of highly valued Ethereum-based NFTs featuring unique cartoon ape designs. The stolen NFTs were transferred to a phishing address and sold for 48.5 ETH.This incident is part of a broader trend of phishing scams targeting cryptocurrency users, with notable losses reported in the first two months of 2024.According to Scam Sniffer data, over $104 million worth of cryptocurrencies has been lost to phishing attacks in this period, with a significant portion coming from the Ethereum ecosystem.

Zombie Coin (ZOMCOIN) to Rally 8,000% After Solana Launch, Looks to Challenge Shiba Inu and DogeCoin



                    

Zombie Coin (ZOMCOIN) could become a viral memecoin, like Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE).



Zombie Coin (ZOMCOIN), a Solana memecoin that was launched today, is aiming to challenge other memecoin giants, such as Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE).




Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Zombie Coin presents a similar opportunity.



Zombie Coin has market cap below $15,000 at the moment, meaning that when it just reaches a modest market cap of $200,000-$500,000, early investors would generate returns of 2,000%-5,000% in a matter of days or hours.



The exciting memecoin is poised to rally 8,000% in the coming two days, and Zombie Coin could potentially reach a multi-million dollar market cap within a few weeks.




Currently, Zombie Coin can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jupiter and Raydium, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days.



To buy Zombie Coin on these platforms, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Zombie Coin by entering its contract address – FbkoYsCAPbcyJkSoqXTxDKKoGQrYoqgtdLf9GBEqy2vr – in the receiving field.



In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price.



If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner.




The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum.



This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like ZOMCOIN.

TON Phishing Message Fools Users With Cheap 5000 USDT - Coincu



	

Key Points:




Slow Mist founder exposes TON phishing messages, which users tricked into believing they receive cheap USDT via TON message comments.



TON’s increased user base attracts scammers who are exploiting its asynchronous nature and smart contract functionality.




A recent revelation by Slow Mist founder sheds light on a new phishing scam leveraging the Telegram Open Network (TON) transfer mechanism to deceive users into receiving seemingly inexpensive USDT tokens.





Slow Mist Founder Exposes TON Phishing Message



The TON phishing messages scam operates through misleading message comments within the TON blockchain, with content suggesting the receipt of substantial amounts of USDT, such as “Received +5,000 USDT.” However, users fall victim to the illusion of receiving such funds, unaware of the deception.



The TON blockchain, renowned for its asynchronous nature and smart contract functionality, facilitates data transmission among its users. The surge in TON’s user base, driven by the growing interest in blockchain technology, has unfortunately led to the proliferation of fraudulent schemes like TON phishing messages.



TON, an integral component of the Web3 ecosystem, aims to redefine decentralized experiences beyond DeFi, dApps, and DAOs. With developers actively collaborating to support Telegram‘s vast user base exceeding 700 million, the TON Foundation plays a pivotal role in fostering this innovative landscape.




Crypto Community Grapples with Persistent Phishing Scams



Crypto phishing scams, a persistent menace in the digital asset realm, exploit unsuspecting individuals by masquerading as legitimate entities and offering false promises of free tokens or coins.



Amidst this backdrop, the crypto community grapples with the aftermath of various scams, including the recent ZKasino fraud case, resulting in investors losing an estimated $33 million in digital assets. Dutch authorities have taken action, apprehending a suspect linked to the ZKasino scam on April 29, signaling efforts to combat fraudulent activities within the industry.

Jack Dorsey says Bitcoin will be worth 'at least a million' by 2030

Twitter co-founder Jack Dorsey says the price of Bitcoin (BTC) could reach a price of at least $1 million by the year 2030, adding that its value could grow even further from that point onwards. Speaking in a May 9 interview with journalist Mike Solana on Pirate Wires, Dorsey offered a bullish outlook for the long-term price action of Bitcoin as well as providing further context behind his abrupt departure from the board of BlueSky — a decentralized Twitter alternative he helped launch in 2019. Dorsey told Solana he believes Bitcoin's price could reach “at least a million” by 2030 adding that that it most likely “hits that number and goes beyond.”Dorsey — now the head of the financial services firm Block — noted that Bitcoin’s price isn’t actually the most interesting aspect of Bitcoin, and instead pointed to the collaborative nature of the ecosystem and the way it incentivizes collective efforts to enhance the network.“The most amazing thing about Bitcoin, apart from the founding story, is anyone who works on it, or gets paid in it, or buys it for themselves — everyone who puts any effort in to make it better — is making the entire ecosystem better, which makes the price go up.”“It's a fascinating ecosystem and movement, more than anything else,” he said before adding, “It taught me a lot.”Source: Mike SolanaRelated: Bitcoin could soon ‘BLOW higher’ on bullish candle hammer: Glassnode execsDorsey raised eyebrows earlier this week when it was confirmed he would be departing the board of Bluesky, a decentralized social network he helped start as an alternative to Twitter.He said that Bluesky was “literally repeating all the mistakes [Twitter] made,” adding that it is not a protocol that could be deemed truly decentralized. “It’s another app,” he said.Dorsey originally envisioned Bluesky as an open-source protocol that Twitter and other social media platforms could build on top of, separating the protocol layer from the application layer to reduce censorship risks.However, he said the firm started behaving more like a traditional company that began pushing for moderation tools. “Everything we wanted around decentralization, everything we wanted in terms of an open source protocol, suddenly became a company with VCs and a board. That's not what I wanted, that's not what I intended to help create.”Dorsey, who has since deleted his Bluesky account, said the platform with Nostr, an anonymous, open protocol with no company or centralized control, aligned more with his goals of censorship resistance.In a note to shareholders on May 2, Dorsey said that his fintech firm Block will flip 10% of its gross profit from Bitcoin-related products back into buying more BTC every month.On May 1, it was reported that US federal prosecutors were probing Block after documents alleged compliance violations at the firm’s payment divisions, Square and Cash App.Magazine: US enforcement agencies are turning up the heat on crypto-related crime

Franklin Templeton: Friend.Tech and SocialFi Fuel Base Growth


Franklin Templeton, a prominent asset manager with a vast portfolio exceeding $1.4 trillion, recently turned its analytical gaze towards Base—a layer-2 (L2) blockchain solution crafted by the crypto exchange Coinbase.
Launched to the public on August 9, 2023, Base has swiftly climbed the ranks within the blockchain community. Particularly, it has caught the eye for its innovative approach in the Social Finance (SocialFi) domain.
Base’s Emergence as a SocialFi Contender
Franklin Templeton’s analysis reveals that roughly 46% of all transactions on Base are intertwined with SocialFi applications. This marks it as a pivotal sector for Base’s adoption and subsequent growth. Franklin Templeton highlights Friend.Tech as a prime example.
Friend.Tech is a mobile-only application that capitalizes on monetizing social interactions on its platform. It has recently made headlines due to the launch of its second version (Friend.Tech V2) and a native token airdrop—FRIEND.

The FRIEND token is claimed to be solely owned by its user base. It boasts a market cap of around $200 million, highlighting the robust community engagement and investor confidence in Base’s ecosystem.
Furthermore, Franklin Templeton outlined that integrating SocialFi applications directly with Coinbase’s expansive user base provides Base a unique advantage.


“With the support of the Coinbase platform, Base has a strong combination of SocialFi applications and direct integration with Coinbase users, positioning itself well to capture a material share of SocialFi activity and remain a leader in the Ethereum L2 sector going forward,” Franklin Templeton analysts wrote.

Base uses “optimistic rollups” to speed up transactions and cut costs. It batches transactions off the main Ethereum blockchain. Then, it consolidates these transactions and finalizes them on the Ethereum mainnet.
This process allows Base to reduce costs significantly while maintaining Ethereum’s high-security standards. Thus, Base stands out among other L2 solutions.
Compared to other L2 solutions like Arbitrum and Optimism, Base has shown unprecedented growth. L2BEAT data shows that Base’s total value locked (TVL) increased by over 630% from $742.63 million to $5.45 billion in the year-to-date (YTD) time frame. Meanwhile, Arbitrum, the top L2 solution with a $16.03 billion TVL, saw only a roughly 47% increase during the same time frame.

Trump-Inspired MAGA Coin Leaves Parody Biden Memecoin In The Dust With 23% Weekly Gain As Ex-President Warms Up More To Crypto - Benzinga

A cryptocurrency themed around former U.S. President Donald Trump surged this week as the firebrand leader stepped up his endorsement of digital currencies. A rival coin, however, saw its fortunes tank.What Happened: MAGA Coin TRUMP/USD saw a 5% increase in the last 24 hours and a 23% rise since the beginning of the week, as per data from Coinmarketcap.This uptick coincided with Trump’s amplified crypto-friendly rhetoric, particularly notable at a recent NFT event where he emphatically endorsed cryptocurrencies, even proclaiming, “If you’re in favor of crypto, you better vote for Trump.” Santiment data confirms a surge in Trump’s mentions across major crypto-centric social platforms, reflecting his growing advocacy for digital assets.See Also: Best 10 Altcoins In May 2024Conversely, mentions of President Joe Biden escalated amidst concerns over potential stringent crypto regulations. This negative sentiment impacted Jeo Boden BODEN/USD, a cryptocurrency parodying the incumbent president, which experienced an 18.88% drop in the last 24 hours and a 28% decrease over the week.Why It Matters: MAGA Coin, inspired by the “Make America Great Again” movement, has skyrocketed 25x year-to-date, signaling the potential rise of a new category of political finance cryptocurrencies, colloquially termed “Politi-Fi.” This trend underscores Trump’s strategic alignment with the growing crypto demographic in the U.S., as highlighted in a Visual Capitalist report revealing approximately 53 million Americans as crypto owners in 2023, the highest in absolute numbers and the third-highest by population share.Since its launch on Aug. 11, 2023, MAGA has surged by an astonishing 35,211%, while BODEN, launched on March 10, 2024, has seen a 768% increase.Read Next: Donald Trump Says ‘You Better Vote’ For Him If You’re Pro-Crypto: But Has He Always Been ‘Fine With It’?Photo via Shutterstock

Can Crypto Markets March Higher When $1.1B Bitcoin Options Expire Today?


																Aside from a minor mid-week dip, crypto markets have been relatively inactive in the past several days and continue to trade sideways.
However, around 18,280 Bitcoin options contracts are set to expire on May 10, which may inject some volatility.
The notional value for this week’s batch of expiring BTC contracts is around $1.15 billion, according to Deribit. The batch is slightly smaller than last week’s expiry event.
Bitcoin Options Expiry
The put/call ratio for this week’s BTC options is 0.64, which means that more calls, or long contracts, are expiring than puts or shorts.
The longs are also dominating in open interest (OI) with almost $700 million at the $70,000 and $100,000 strike prices. Open interest refers to the number or value of contracts that have yet to be settled.




OI for put contracts is also starting to creep up with around $360 million at the $50,000 strike price, according to Deribit.
Overall, the open interest for Bitcoin call options is more than double the OI for put options, indicating bullish trader sentiment.
Call options give the right to purchase the underlying asset at a predetermined price on or before a specific date.
Moreover, trading firms like QCP Capital and Paradigm have observed revived demand for upside call options, including buyers closing existing positions to roll into higher strike calls expiring in July and September.

In addition to today’s batch of Bitcoin options, 276,000 Ethereum contracts are also set to expire.
These have a notional value of around $840 million and a put/call ratio of 0.74. There is a lot of OI, around $636 million, at the $3,600 strike price, indicating that Ethereum derivatives traders are also bullish.
Crypto Market Outlook
Crypto markets have gained 2.1% on the day to reach $2.45 trillion in total capitalization. However, they have consolidated around this level since mid-April with very little movement in either direction.
Bitcoin dipped below $61,000 on May 9 but has recovered to tap $63,000 during the Friday morning Asian trading session. The asset has been down trending since its all-time high in mid-March and has lost 15% since then.
Ethereum prices hit an intraday low of $2,953 but have since recovered to reach $3,032 at the time of writing.
The altcoins are mostly in the green at the moment, with larger gains for Solana (SOL) and Toncoin (TON).

                        Tech leader Jack Dorsey is betting big on Bitcoin, forecasting a price explosion to over $1 million by 2030.As Pirates Wires’ Mike Solana asked for his take on Bitcoin’s future value, Dorsey said: “I don’t know. Over… at least a million. I do think it hits that number and goes beyond.”Still, the crypto asset’s price itself takes a backseat for Dorsey, who reiterated his core fascination with Bitcoin lies in other aspects.“The most amazing thing about Bitcoin, apart from the founding story, is anyone who works on it, or gets paid in it, or buys it for themselves — everyone who puts any effort in to make it better — is making the entire ecosystem better, which makes the price go up,” he said in the interview published Thursday. “It’s a fascinating ecosystem and movement, more than anything else. It taught me a lot.”Dorsey isn’t alone in foreseeing Bitcoin reaching remarkable levels. Ark Invest CEO Cathie Wood also sees a $1m valuation for Bitcoin by 2030. Additionally, Jurrien Timmer, director of global macro at Fidelity Investments, has projected a seven-figure range for Bitcoin estimating it to fall between $1m and $10m in 2030.
Dorsey Ditches Bluesky For Repeating Twitter’s ‘Mistakes’
This week, Dorsey, the one-time Twitter CEO, revealed he stepped down from Bluesky’s board. The platform, envisioned in 2019, aims to be a decentralized social media alternative.“Everything we wanted around decentralization, everything we wanted in terms of an open source protocol, suddenly became a company with VCs and a board,” he told Pirates Wire. “That’s not what I wanted, that’s not what I intended to help create.”He attributed his departure to Bluesky’s path, saying it was “literally repeating all the mistakes [Twitter] made as a company.”Dorsey further revealed his true focus lies with Nostr, another decentralized platform challenging Twitter. He said he wanted to support Nostr’s development as a genuine open-source protocol.
Jack Dorsey’s Block Announces Strategic Monthly Bitcoin Purchases
Dorsey is currently head of payments firm Block, which is doubling down on Bitcoin. Last week, the firm announced a new strategy to invest 10% of its Bitcoin product profits into buying more Bitcoin every month.Block was one of the first public companies to invest in Bitcoin, with a $220m investment in 2020. The company’s Bitcoin holdings have surged 160% to reach $573m by the end of Q1 2024.

Harvest Plans To Open Bitcoin ETF To Mainland China


								Harvest Global Investments, a Chinese fund house and one of the issuers of Hong Kong’s first spot Bitcoin and Ethereum exchange-traded funds (ETFs), has confirmed plans to potentially open these funds to mainland Chinese investors through the Hong Kong Stock Connect. This development could vastly expand the investor base and significantly impact the cryptocurrency market in Asia.
Harvest CEO Eyes Mainland Access For HK Bitcoin ETF
Currently, Harvest Global offers Bitcoin and Ether ETFs in Hong Kong, with these products enabling direct investment in the respective cryptocurrencies. The possibility of including these ETFs in the ETF Connect scheme, part of the broader Stock Connect initiative launched in 2014 to link Hong Kong with mainland Chinese exchanges, was discussed by Harvest CEO Han Tongli at the Bitcoin Asia conference.
Han stated, “We don’t rule out applying for our ETFs to be included in the connect programme, as long as everything goes smooth and well in the next two years.”

The move to integrate crypto investments into the Stock Connect could be a significant step, given the previously restricted access to such products for mainland investors. Hong Kong’s approach to cryptocurrency regulation has been more open compared to mainland China, where most commercial crypto activities are banned, but trading and ownership by individuals remain a gray area legally.
Despite the innovative nature of these spot crypto ETFs and their ability to offer direct exposure to cryptocurrencies rather than derivatives or stocks of companies related to digital currencies, the initial trading volumes have been underwhelming compared to the US market. According to Han, this is partly due to the market’s cautious view of Hong Kong’s virtual asset policies and its implications for the future of these ETFs.

Han remarked during a panel at the Bitcoin Asia conference that the local market could potentially double the size of the US products, emphasizing the strategic importance of Hong Kong as a more neutral ground with broader appeal in Asia. He attributed the slow start to various factors, including the market’s doubts about Hong Kong’s commitment to becoming a crypto hub, stating, “People are still skeptical about Hong Kong’s status as a special [administrative] region. It’s located in China, and many people don’t want to see Hong Kong become more successful for whatever reason.”
In his discussion, Han also highlighted the competitive advantages of Hong Kong’s crypto products, like the possibility for in-kind subscriptions — buying ETFs directly with bitcoin and ether — and temporary waiving of management fees to attract investors. These features, along with the potential inclusion in the Stock Connect, are seen as critical to gaining traction and establishing Hong Kong as a key player in the global cryptocurrency market.
At press time, BTC traded at $62,754.

Russian Opposition Leader Mark Feygin Launches Blockchain-Based Referendum on Vladimir Putin’s Election Win

The results of this effort would, of course, have no legal weight in Russia and would not end Putin's presidency per se, but the referendum could, in theory, give a public relations boost to efforts to oust him. And it gives Russians a way to voice criticism in a nation where the consequences of dissent can be high; opposition leader Alexei Navalny recently died while jailed in an Arctic penal colony.

President Joe Biden is trying hard to 'kill crypto', says Cardano founder

Cardano founder Charles Hoskinson has lashed out at United States President Joe Biden, claiming that he’s making a concerted effort to kill the crypto industry in the United States.In a May 9 video posted to X, Hoskinson said it was “unambiguously clear” the Biden administration is trying its best to “destroy the American cryptocurrency industry.”He said that over the past few years, the U.S. government had “hurt [the crypto] industry in every way possible,” citing the restricted access to bank accounts, the Securities and Exchange Commission's policy of regulation by enforcement — and most recently — the White House "obstructing" the legislative process. “A vote for Biden is a vote against the American cryptocurrency industry.” Hoksinson’s comments came following a statement from President Biden's office, which said he would veto legislation looking to overturn SEC guidelines that discourage banks from custodying crypto assets. On May 8, the White House said it “strongly opposes” members of the House of Representatives that later passed a joint resolution to overturn SAB 121.The White House claimed nullifying SAB 121 would hinder the SEC’s ability to “protect investors in crypto-asset markets and to safeguard the broader financial system.”Source: Charles HoskinsonAdditionally, Hoskinson lashed out at the SEC for leveraging antiquated legislation that he said shouldn’t apply to new and emerging asset classes. “The Securities Exchange Act passed in 1933, to say that it is sufficient to regulate assets that came 90 years later is an absurd statement.” He cited Switzerland, Singapore, and Dubai as jurisdictions that welcome crypto companies and have reaped the benefits of millions of dollars worth of investments, stemming from the 3,000 firms that “probably would have domiciled in the United States had our crypto policy been reasonable.” Related: President Biden says he would veto resolution countermanding SEC crypto ruleA user on Twitter pushed back on Hoskinson’s Biden-specific claims, saying that the previous Trump Administration hadn’t exactly been open to crypto either. Hoskinson didn’t mince words in response, saying this stance was “completely wrong.”“The [Trump] administration had its issues but mostly ignored our industry. The Biden administration has engaged in a coordinated effort to kill crypto.”In April, Cointelegraph reported that the Biden Administration asked Congress to target the American Bitcoin mining industry, citing China as an example for the U.S. to follow.Magazine: What do crypto market makers actually do?

Altcoins will bottom in early summer before bull run - Analyst

Bitcoin (BTC) aside, the cryptocurrency market could find its local bottom in June, marking the start of the next altcoin bull cycle, according to market analysts. Altcoin bottom could occur in June: analystBased on historical chart patterns, altcoins could be set to find their local price bottom around the beginning of June, according to popular crypto analyst Rekt Capital, who wrote in a May 8 X post:“Altcoins are following the plan perfectly. Altcoins bottomed in early February. Altcoins sold off around the BTC Halving. Altcoins to bottom early summer.”Altcoin hype cycles. Source: Rekt CapitalThe altcoin market took a beating during the past month. The market cap of altcoins, excluding the 10 largest cryptocurrencies, fell over 21% during the previous month to $265 billion.Altcoin market cap, Source: TradingViewDespite the monthly slump, the altcoin market cap is still up over 24% year-to-date (YTD), and over 167% during the past year.Altcoin sentiment is historically correlated with Bitcoin price. Altcoins could find their local bottom around June, as market sentiment and Bitcoin price remains subdued by decreasing inflows from U.S. spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs), according to Alex Onufriychuk, blockchain advisor and coach at QUBIC Labs Accelerator. He told Cointelegraph:“There is a possibility that could find their local bottom by June due to the lack of sufficient new liquidity from Bitcoin ETFs in the U.S. and Hong Kong. This indicates that the consolidation period may be prolonged.”Related: Did XRP price just bottom against Bitcoin?Bitcoin breakout will spark altcoin bull cycle: NansenDespite seeing a potential local bottom, an altcoin bull run would first require Bitcoin price to break out to the upside, according to Aurelie Barthere, principal research analyst at Nansen, who told Cointelegraph:"Altcoins are high beta crypto, they are successful when the sentiment is very bullish. Since mid-March, the sentiment among crypto investors is less exuberant. As BTC price consolidates around the 20-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA), there is more volatility in Alts. We need a break above and a clear resumption of BTC uptrend for alts to outperform."BTC price has been posting lower highs since mid March. But many analysts argue that this is a healthy period of consolidation after the halving. Moreover, the charts hint at a multi-month bull flag taking shape for new all-time highs later this year. BTC/USDT, 1-day chart. Source: TradingviewSince altcoin sentiment is strongly related to Bitcoin price, finding a local bottom wouldn’t necessarily translate into an altcoin rally, wrote QUBIC Labs’ Onufriychuk:“Even if altcoins find their local bottom around June, it does not necessarily mean that a bull run will start. For a significant turnaround, more fundamental changes are required, such as increased retail and institutional investment and favorable regulatory developments, given the scarcity of new liquidity and heavy reliance on institutional reinvestment into newer projects.”On the monthly chart, 10 out of 12 moving averages (MA) are flashing a buy signal for the top altcoins, such as Ether (ETH), which has struggled.

“While some may survive, most will likely fail, particularly due to the lack of transparency in stablecoin operations and vulnerability to speculative sentiment.”
The research analyzed the collapse of TerraUSD stablecoin, leaving a ripple effect on the entire crypto market. “These incidents highlight the volatility and risks associated with stablecoins, and the need for greater transparency and regulation in the cryptocurrency market,” the report read.Further, Deutsche Bank criticized Tether – a dominant stablecoin – questioning its solvency and its industry standard for crypto derivatives.
“A ‘Tether peso moment’ could cause significant losses, negatively impacting leveraged traders and causing severe repercussions for the entire crypto system.”
Additionally, the report stressed the challenges in constructing stable currency pegs, despite the novelty of cryptocurrencies. “It is likely that we will see much more instability in the years to come,” it added.The German banking giant surveyed over 3,350 consumers in March (550 in France, Germany, Spain, Italy, UK each and 600 in USA), questioning the stability of stablecoins.“Only 18% of consumers expecting them to thrive, while 42% expect them to fade,” the survey found.
Tether Slams Deutsche Bank’s Stablecoin Warning
Notably, the research team wrote that they are concerned about Tether, given its implications amid “monopoly in the stablecoin market.” According to a Bloomberg report, the analysts also pointed out reliance on Tether in the crypto derivatives market.“The 30% de-peg rate among some stablecoins is therefore hardly surprising, and many defunct stablecoins are hard to account for.”Retaliating back to Deutsche Bank’s stablecoin claims, Tether said that the research “lacks clarity and substantial evidence, relying on vague assertions rather than rigorous analysis.”“While it attempts to forecast the decline of stablecoins, it fails to provide concrete data to support its claims.”

Telegram-Linked Toncoin Price Soars, But So Do Scams As Hackers Steal $140K Worth Of Tokens From Unsuspecting Users - Benzinga

Telegram-linked cryptocurrency Toncoin's TON/USD impressive run on the price charts this year has thrilled market participants, but the rising popularity has inadvertently drawn the attention of bad actors as well.What Happened: According to Web3 anti-scam platform Scam Sniffer, an address with a criminal history swindled as many as 22,000 TON tokens from unsuspecting users over the past few days. At the current market price, the stolen amount was worth $140,000. Digging deep into the modus operandi, the on-chain sleuth showed how users are duped into clicking a popup that promises to transfer USDT USDT/USD to their wallets. However, these were nothing but phishing links that ended up emptying their wallets of TON tokens.Similar findings were reported by cybersecurity firm Kaspersky, which unearthed a sophisticated phishing operation active since November 2023 that targeted TON holders. Why It Matters: Toncoin has been one of the crypto market's success stories in 2024, soaring 185% on a year-to-date basis, according to data from Benzinga Pro.According to a report by Santiment last week, Toncoin witnessed the fastest network growth among leading cryptocurrencies over the last six months.  The growth was fueled by social messaging giant Telegram's public support for the project, and its growing utility within the Telegram ecosystem. However, as the network grows in strength, and valuation increases, it would attract the predatory gazes of scammers and phishers, who don't need any second invitation to jump on money-making opportunities. Scam Sniffer reported losses of nearly $300 million due to crypto phishing scams in 2023, and $173 million already as of March. Price Action: At the time of writing, TON was exchanging hands at $6.58, marking double-digit gains of 11% in the last 24 hours.Read Next: If You Invested $1,000 In Bitcoin When Donald Trump Said The Crypto’s Value Was ‘Based On Thin Air,’ Here’s How Much You’d Have NowImage via Shutterstock

Crypto Analyst Says Bullish Cycle Not Over, Predicts $100,000 Bitcoin in Fourth Quarter - But There’s a Catch - The Daily Hodl


								A widely followed crypto trader says that Bitcoin (BTC) could skyrocket to a six-figure price tag in the fourth quarter of 2024.
In a new thread, pseudonymous crypto analyst Altcoin Sherpa tells his 215,900 followers on the social media platform X that the top crypto asset by market cap’s bull cycle has yet to finish.










“I still don’t think that it would be ‘over’ though and that’s it for this cycle. I think that we still are going to see BTC to six figures and some sort of mania.” 
According to the pseudonymous analyst, the crypto king could “giga send” to a price of $100,000 in the fourth quarter of 2024.
However, Altcoin Sherpa says that there are a few compelling bear cases for BTC that could see it fall by up to 35% from its current price before it shoots up to six figures.
“Is it ‘over’? I don’t think so. But I think that this type of price action leads to larger downtrends/pullbacks. Even if BTC goes to $40,000-$50,000, it’s still high time frame bullish. 
But if we saw a move to $50,000, this would result in (probably) a violent move that would wreck the market (move from $60,000-$50,000 would be strong) and altcoins take a 50% haircut or more from current levels…
 We’re not there yet but might need a further washout. I could envision a scenario where BTC goes to $40,000-$50,000, everything gets wiped out, we chop for three to four months around there and then giga send to $100,000 in Q4 2024.”

SBI VC Set To Become a Validator On The XRP Ledger From May 10


							

SBI VC announces plans to become a validator on the XRP Ledger.



The crypto exchange plans to achieve XRP validator status by operating XRP nodes.



According to SBI VC, a validator status will allow it to contribute directly to XRP development.




SBI VC, a foremost cryptocurrency exchange operator in Japan, has announced that it will begin operating nodes as a validator on the XRP ledger from May 10, 2024. According to the exchange, they aim to run a stable operation and achieve recognition by the XRP Ledger community. 



Furthermore, SBI VC highlighted earning a validator status will enable its inclusion in the list of trusted validators (UNL, Unique Node List) recommended by the XRP Ledger Foundation in the future. The exchange also noted that registering with the UNL will enable it to contribute more directly to the development of the ecosystem, including voting on new features of the XRP Ledger. 



It is essential to note that blockchain operators registered with the UNL qualify to contribute directly to the XRP ecosystem development. Hence, SBI VC explained that part of their goal is to be the validator that reflects the voices of the XRP community in Japan.



According to SBI VC, its crypto exchange hosts many XRP holders. Therefore, its validator status achievement and registration with the UNL will enable the effective representation of its customers. The crypto exchange explained that the representation process will involve voting on the XRP development after considering customers’ opinions through surveys.









In addition to customer representation, SBI VC plans to disseminate information and provide education regarding amendments such as new features. The Japanese crypto exchange highlighted that its proposed awareness program will help XRP holders make appropriate and constructive decisions for the ecosystem. 



XRP Ledger is a decentralized blockchain solution that started running in 2012. As a blockchain solution, some of XRP Ledger’s goals include achieving fast settlement, low cost, scalability, and carbon neutrality. Many blockchain users consider XRP Ledger the best L1 public chain for business use cases.

Mastercard Collaborates with US Banking Titans | Coin Insider


Key Takeaways:Enhanced security and efficiency: Tokenisation, which involves replacing sensitive data with unique identification symbols, improves security by reducing the risk of fraud. Mastercard and the partnering banks aim to create a more secure and efficient payment ecosystem by leveraging this technology for settlement trials.Digital transformation acceleration: The collaboration underscores a collective effort towards embracing digital transformation within the financial sector. Potential for industry-wide adoption: Successful trials could pave the way for broader adoption of tokenised settlements. In a move to enhance the efficiency and security of financial transactions, Mastercard has teamed up with prominent United States banking giants to pioneer trials in tokenised settlement.This collaboration marks a significant step forward in digital payments, promising streamlined processes and fortified security measures. Mastercard’s move was to test the use of distributed ledger technology for banking settlements using tokenisation. This partnership between the banking giants and the payment processor suggested that it aims to test a shared-led technology called Regulated Settlement Network (RSN), which enables tokenised assets such as Treasury, investment-grade debt instruments, and money from commercial banks to be settled collectively.Exploring Tokenised SettlementThe tokenised settlement represents a paradigm shift in conducting financial transactions, leveraging blockchain technology to tokenise traditional assets. This process converts assets into digital tokens, each with a unique identifier securely recorded on a blockchain network. This methodology facilitates instant and secure transfers, eliminating the need for intermediaries and reducing transactional complexities. Securities such as investment-grade debt and money from commercial banks are said to function on different systems. RSN suggested that settlement procedures will occur on a single platform by converting various assets into tokens and settling them on a distributed ledger. The trial phase started in late 2022 and expanded to a 12-week pilot phase. Reports suggested that ongoing proof-of-concept (PoC) RSN trials are focused on stimulating settlements in the US dollar.Mastercard’s alliance with leading US banking titans underscores its commitment to spearheading innovation in the payments landscape. By joining forces with industry giants, Mastercard aims to harness the potential of tokenised settlement to revolutionise how transactions are settled, facilitating a more seamless and secure financial ecosystem. This partnership assembles the resources and expertise of key stakeholders to drive forward-thinking solutions that address the progressing needs of consumers and businesses alike. According to a Mastercard statement, the project is focused on increasing the efficiency of cross-border settlements and reducing the chance of error and fraud. Head of Blockchain and Digital Assets at Mastercard, Raj Dhamodharan: “The application of shared ledger technology to dollar settlements could unlock the next generation of market infrastructures — where programmable settlements are 24/7 and frictionless.”Key Objectives and BenefitsThe trials conducted by Mastercard and its banking partners are poised to achieve several key objectives, yielding a myriad of benefits for stakeholders across the financial spectrum. One primary goal is to streamline settlement processes, reducing the time and complexity associated with traditional methods. By leveraging tokenisation and blockchain technology, transactions can be executed faster and more efficiently, enhancing overall operational efficiency. According to the RSN PoC, two significant additions to the participating banking institution have been made. Interbank tokenised deposit networks — USDF Consortium will be a direct participant, and the Tassat Group will be a contributor. The report suggested that Deloitte, another banking giant, will provide advisory services to the Securities Industry and Financial Markets Association (SIFMA) as the program manager. Tokenised settlement offers enhanced security features, mitigating the risks associated with fraudulent activities and unauthorised access. The cryptographic nature of blockchain ensures tamper-proof record-keeping, safeguarding sensitive transactional data against malicious threats. This heightened level of security instils trust and confidence among participants, fostering a more resilient and transparent financial infrastructure. There are a total of 10 participating banking giants, including JPMorgan. Sift, Mastercard, TD Bank NA, US Bank, Citi, Visa, USDF, Zions Bancorp and Wells Fargo. Six more project participants will offer their subject-matter expertise, like the nonprofit MITRE Corporations, Broadridge, BNY Mellon, Tessat Group, ISDA, and the DTCC.Implications for the Future of PaymentsThe collaboration between Mastercard and US banking titans heralds a new era in digital payments, with far-reaching consequences for financial transactions. As tokenised settlement gains traction, traditional payment systems will likely undergo transformative changes, ushering in a more decentralised and inclusive financial ecosystem.The adoption of tokenisation and blockchain technology is poised to extend beyond settlements, permeating various facets of the financial industry. From asset tokenisation to decentralised finance (DeFi) solutions, the possibilities are vast and multifaceted. This shift towards digitisation and decentralisation has the potential to democratise access to financial services, empowering individuals and businesses worldwide.The collaboration between Mastercard and US banking titans for tokenised settlement trials represents a significant milestone in the evolution of digital payments. By harnessing the power of blockchain technology, these trials aim to revolutionise settlement processes, enhancing efficiency, security, and accessibility.

Solana beats Ethereum in key areas: Are investors turning away from ETH? - AMBCrypto



Solana outperformed Ethereum in terms of fees paid out to validators.
Usage on the Ethereum network declined, as the price of ETH fell.

The popularity of the Solana [SOL] network has helped it attract a large number of users, due to which an increase in activity on the network was observed.
Gas is paid
Due to the rising activity on the network, the fees paid out to validators on the Solana network had grown.
Ethereum [ETH] has long been the dominant player in the smart contract platform space. Solana’s rise in popularity, especially if its fees remain competitive with Ethereum’s, could chip away at Ethereum’s market share.
This weakens Ethereum’s position as the go-to blockchain for developers and users.

The state of the Ethereum network has also been dire. Over the last month, the number of daily active addresses on the Ethereum network had declined significantly.
According to Token Terminal, the number of daily active users on the network fell by 2.9% in the last 30 days.
Moreover, the average revenue generated by the network also declined significantly by 81.6% during this period.
Source: Token Terminal
The NFT trades on the Ethereum network also declined significantly over the last month.
The popularity of NFTs from alternative chains such as Bitcoin [BTC] and Solana [SOL] may be grabbing a good chunk of the Ethereum network.

ETH failed to fare well in terms of price as well. Since the 8th of April, its price fell considerably, exhibiting multiple lower lows and lower highs, indicative of a bearish trend.
Coupled with that, the CMF (Chaikin Money Flow) for Ethereum fell significantly to -0.21 during this period. This meant that the money flowing into ETH had declined significantly in the last few days.
The RSI (Relative Strength Index) for Ethereum also declined during this period, implying that momentum was with the bears at the time of writing.

SBF maintains his innocence as he trades rice in jail

FTX co-founder Sam Bankman-Fried still maintains his innocence despite getting 25 years in jail for fraud and while he plans his appeal, he’s taken to commodities trading — namely bags of rice.In his first in-person chat with the media since being locked up in Brooklyn’s Metropolitan Detention Center (MDC) in August 2023, Bankman-Fried spoke to Puck News’ William Cohan in an interview published May 9 which Bankman-Fried’s mother Barbara Fried was involved in organizing.The ex-FTX CEO’s diet sees him get vegan meals that fellow inmates think “literally [smell] like shit” so he lives on beans and rice — the latter has “become one of the currencies of the realm inside MDC.”The alum of trading house Jane Street Capital and co-founder of trading firm Alameda Research reportedly joked about how much better the arbitrage opportunities are in jail compared to his former life as a high-frequency trader.Bankman-Fried was “considerably thinner,” losing 25 pounds (11 kilograms) and was “less pudgy, less manic, less fidgety," with no bags under his eyes, Puck reported.He looked Cohan in the eyes “pretty much the whole time," during the interview — something he “rarely did” before — but the jailed founder admitted he’d “become good at faking” that he was doing well.Source: Tiffany FongBankman-Fried is cordoned off with 35 other male inmates — half reportedly murderers who are cooperating with the government — in a large open dorm-style room in a part of the MDC mostly for female inmates. He’s reportedly extremely bored with only four TVs and a non-internet-connected tablet for entertainment which he plays games on.He’s not worried about his safety but doesn’t sleep well as other inmates wake him to ask about his bags of rice as they want to use them for bartering.SBF thinks he’s “the fall guy”Last month, Bankman-Fried filed notice that he’s appealing his fraud and money laundering conviction, something his lawyers said he’d do when found guilty in November.He speaks to his new lawyer “nearly every weekday for an hour or so” and his approved prescription medication has him “thinking clearly," said Cohan. The former exchange head told Cohan he was “set up to be the fall guy” for the collapse of FTX — saying his only slip-up was negligence that put FTX in a place “vulnerable to a bank run and the devious actions of its competitors” adding a reasonable punishment would be civil, not criminal penalties.Related: Changpeng Zhao gets 4 months, Sam Bankman-Fried gets 25 years — Why? Cohan noted Bankman-Fried “still doesn’t believe he committed any crimes” and painted himself as an innocent participant who didn’t get a chance to negotiate sufficiently with prosecutors.He was also “not exactly apologetic” about the roughly $8 billion in customer funds he was convicted of helping to misappropriate.Bankman-Fried claims the army of lawyers that he passed FTX off to, pinned him for the collapse of the firm. The former CEO believed if he stayed at FTX’s helm, it would not have collapsed into bankruptcy but would instead be a thriving company worth $80 billion.He added he should’ve tried harder to find someone other than ex-girlfriend Caroline Ellison to lead Alameda after his lawyers convinced him it was a conflict of interest to run the trading firm and FTX simultaneously — or just ignored them and continued to run both.Bankman-Fried has asked to stay at the MDC until he files his appeal which should come in July. He can, however, be moved at any time and will likely be placed in a facility near his parents — on the other side of the country in California.If that happens, it’s reportedly likely to be in a prison bus which can take up to four months as it journeys across the United States, which picks up and drops off inmates as it goes.Magazine: Inner City Press says ‘less flashy’ Mashinsky set for less jail time than SBF: X Hall of Flame

                        Arch Labs has secured a $7 million investment to develop a Bitcoin-native application platform.The seed funding round was led by Multicoin Capital with other participants and contributors including Portal Ventures, OKX Ventures, Big Brain Holdings, CMS Holdings, Tangent, Cypher, and Newman Capital.Bridgeless Bitcoin-Native Network
The company planned to utilize this fund to advance Arch’s development of decentralized finance (DeFi) applications directly on the Bitcoin blockchain, bypassing the need for secondary layers or bridges.The reliance on secondary layers often complicates the user experience and compromise the inherent security benefits of operating directly on the Bitcoin network.“Ordinals marked a foundational shift in Bitcoin’s evolution. It signaled the beginning of a new era where Bitcoin could serve as more than just a payment ledger,” said Arch co-founder and CEO Matt Mudano.“This moment paved the way for Arch,” stated Mudano. “We’re building on Bitcoin’s unmatched security and liquidity to unlock an entirely new application ecosystem on the world’s more secure and liquid blockchain.”The funds were raised primarily for the expansion of the platform’s development team. By bringing on additional skilled developers, Arch Labs aims to accelerate the creation and refinement of decentralized applications.
Arch’s Features and Rollout Plan
Arch is a parallelized, proof-of-stake that features a Rust-based zkVM, known as the ArchVM, and a decentralized verifier network, forming a trustless execution environment within the blockchain.“We’ve evaluated several Bitcoin Layer 2’s and all of them make the same set of trade offs that sacrifice security in exchange for speed,” said Multicoin Capital Investment Principal Vishal Kankani.“Arch is explicitly not a Layer 2 in the sense that takers do not have to bridge assets to some untrusted chain to use it,” said Kankani.In addition to expanding its team, Arch Labs is set on launching a public development network (devnet) followed by a mainnet release scheduled for the latter half of the year.This progression will enable early testers and future users to explore the capabilities of the platform, improving stability and functionality before a full-scale public rollout.

Japanese Financial Giant Starts Running XRP Ledger Validator


SBI VC Trade, the cryptocurrency exchange of Japanese financial giant SBI Holdings, has announced the launch of their validator on the XRP Ledger.With its recent move, SBI aims to reflect the voices of its customers who hold the XRP cryptocurrency, according to the company’s announcement. Vet, operator of the XRP Ledger dUNL, has stressed that this is a “huge step” since a large enterprise is now running infrastructure for the XRP Ledger. Ripple initially partnered with SBI back in 2017. It has also offered year-end benefits for shareholders in the XRP cryptocurrency.In 2023, SBI Remit, a subsidiary of SBI Holdings, expanded its XRP-powered services to several countries, including Vietnam and the Philippines. Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse has repeatedly touted Japan as one of the most cryptocurrency-friendly jurisdictions. In 2020, he even suggested that Ripple’s headquarters could be relocated to Tokyo before the SEC took the company to court. In April, Ripple expanded its presence in Japan by announcing a tie-up with Tokyo-based HashKey DX. The aim of the collaboration is to use the XRP Ledger for developing enterprise solutions for customers in Japan.

Notcoin Listing Triggers Over 11% Spike in Toncoin


OKX and Binance, two leading global crypto exchanges, recently announced the Notcoin (NOT) listing on their respective platforms.
The crypto community expressed their enthusiasm following these announcements.
Will Notcoin Enhance the TON Blockchain Ecosystem?
OKX will use its platform for new crypto projects, Jumpstart, to let Toncoin (TON) holders stake their coins for NOT tokens. They have set a staking limit of 4,000 TON per participant. The staking process will start at 06:00 UTC on May 13, 2024.
Binance Launchpool has also introduced Notcoin as its 54th project. Users can farm NOT by staking BNB and First Digital USD (FDUSD). The farming will start on May 13, 2024, at 00.00 UTC.

Notcoin, a community token within the TON Blockchain, gained initial popularity from a viral tap-to-earn game on Telegram. This game has 35 million participants. It also has engaged users and introduced them to Web3 technologies.
Notcoin is now focusing on building an ecosystem. The current focus includes a gaming platform and Web3 project exploration tools.
However, the official launch date for Notcoin remains unannounced. Yet, its listings on CoinGecko and CoinMarketCap suggest the launch is imminent.
This development has positively impacted Toncoin, the TON Blockchain’s native token. Its price increased by about 11.32% in the last 24 hours, trading at $6.57 at the time of writing.

Besides the much-anticipated launch of Notcoin, TON Blockchain has been making headlines lately, notably due to its partnership spree. Among the significant developments is the substantial investment from Pantera Capital. Although the amount is undisclosed, Pantera Capital claimed that TON is their “largest investment ever.”
In a recent blog post, Pantera Capital’s CEO, Dan Morehead, articulated his views on blockchain’s transformative potential—influenced partly by his interactions with Telegram founder Pavel Durov. Morehead highlighted Durov’s commitment to principles of freedom and openness, which are foundational to the Telegram platform and, by extension, to the TON Blockchain.

“We are honored to partner with people of such strong conviction. Pantera recently made the largest investment in its history in TON,” Morehead stated.


Ryan Barney, a partner at Pantera Capital, also shared his thoughts. He further explained the rationale for their TON investment.

“Telegram is a community integrating blockchain technology. That’s just got to be easier. They’ve begun rolling out a blockchain wallet to their 930 million users,” Barney outlined.

The crypto and Web3 sectors have shown increased interest in gaming-themed tokens. For instance, Binance’s listing of SAGA, a native token of layer-1 (L1) gaming blockchain Saga, attracted significant attention. Saga claimed that over $13 billion worth of BNB and FDUSD got staked within 24 hours of its launch on Binance Launchpool.

Venture capital also continues to shape the Web3 gaming niche. Massive investments from firms like Andreessen Horowitz (a16z) in Web3 gaming projects highlight the industry’s renewed interest.

Russian opposition activist launches zero-knowledge voting app to challenge Putin's inauguration - Crypto Briefing




Russian opposition activist and former Pussy Riot lawyer Mark Feygin has launched a referendum on the zero-knowledge voting app Russia2024, challenging the legitimacy of the recent Russian elections and Vladimir Putin’s inauguration as president.The vote, which went live on May 10th, three days after Putin’s inauguration, is the first protest vote on the app following months of audits and stress tests.Russia2024 was built using Rarimo’s Freedom Tool, an open-source, surveillance-free voting solution that leverages blockchain and zero-knowledge cryptography to ensure citizens can poll, vote, and protest without being tracked. The app was first announced in a broadcast on March 9, 2024.Following the announcement, the Kremlin attempted to obstruct the app by filing against it, temporarily removing it from the Apple store, and sponsoring negative reviews, a strategy exposed by a whistleblower who expressed support for the app.“Dissent in Russia is growing more risky and public opinion harder to track. It is critical that we provide reliable, surveillance-proof avenues for protest and polling. Russia2024 and its underlying technology has enabled that,” Feygin said in a press release shared with Crypto Briefing.The app was developed by Kyiv-based Rarilabs, with key contributions from activist developers working anonymously inside regimes around the world. Rarilabs is a privacy-first social protocol backed by Pantera Capital. In 2022, the company raised $10 million at a $100 million valuation for its Series A funding round.According to the project’s whitepaper, the app uses Russia’s machine-readable passport information submitted by a user.The data is then decrypted and verified locally (on a device). Digital identity, once authenticated, is resolved using a generated keypair, which is then used to interact with the app’s smart contract. The image below illustrates how the app works.Zero-knowledge cryptography severs the link between the pass and passport data, and votes are published directly on Arbitrum, an Ethereum L2, where the data then becomes tamper-proof.“Freedom Tool was built to help give a voice to people living in regimes. Its implementation in Russia is an early example of how blockchain and zero-knowledge cryptography can meet the urgent need around the world for privacy technology,” said Lasha Antadze, co-founder of Rarilabs.Antadze previously worked on the Ukrainian government’s e-identity and digitalization reform, as well as the EU’s Stork 2.0 digital signature standardization.

Japanese company Metaplanet acquires an additional 19.87 BTC Worth 200 Million Yen | Cryptopolitan

The Japanese company Metaplanet made headlines after acquiring close to 20 BTC in what looked like Microstrategy’s approach to accumulating Bitcoin. Metaplanet Inc. has embarked on an aggressive approach to buying and holding Bitcoin. Considering this recent purchase, Metaplanet Inc. has a total of 117.7 Bitcoins, currently valued at approximately $7.3 million. Metaplanet’s Inc. is a large investment and consulting firm in the heart of Tokyo, and its decision to aggressively purchase Bitcoins is a clear indicator of a shift in investment strategy. Understanding the Magnitude of Metaplanet’s BTC investmentDepending on who’s reading this, a $6.5 million investment in Bitcoin could represent a significant investment or not. The company’s decision to invest this much in Bitcoin is better understood by looking at its total market cap. Reportedly, the Japanese company’s Bitcoin holdings now account for approximately 33% of its total market capitalization. This is a significant investment in Metaplanet’s books, indicating how valuable the Japanese company perceives Bitcoin. The Japanese Investment and Consulting company follows in the footsteps of pro-Bitcoin corporations like Microstrategy, which have also continued accumulating Bitcoin as part of their primary asset holdings. Metaplanet’s Grand Plan with BitcoinTokyo’s financial institution has completely embraced the corporate Bitcoin standard. Dylan LeClair, who recently joined the company as the Director of Bitcoin Strategy, shared how the company will strategically leverage public capital markets to acquire additional Bitcoin for shareholders over time. According to Dylan, the financial repression in Japan has left investors with limited investment options to choose from. As a result, the company is looking for alternative options like Bitcoin to insulate its balance sheets from realities such as the structural weakness of the yen. The institution’s grand plan is not only to strengthen its balance sheets but also to capitalize on it. Bitcoin is viewed as a safer alternative to hedge against inflation, triggering corporations to explore its benefits. Larger institutions like Microstagey are leading the way. Metaplanet Inc. is looking to be a pioneer of corporate Bitcoin in Japan. The bold steps by the Japanese company set the stage for financial institutions alike to accept Bitcoin as a digital asset, impacting its balance sheets. As a result, the revolution continues to grow, and more investors get exposed to Bitcoin, leading to mass adoption as intended.

Eclipse Founder Accused of Sexual Misconduct, Steps Down


							

Neel Somani, the founder of Eclipse, has been accused of sexual harassment.



Somani maintained his innocence, adding that he never sexually assaulted anyone.



Somani is stepping down as the public face of Eclipse. 




Neel Somani, the founder of Eclipse, Ethereum’s fastest L2 solution powered by the Solana Virtual Machine, focused on privacy, security, and decentralization, has faced allegations of misconduct, ranging from inappropriate social media conduct to serious accusations of sexual assault. 



Haseeb Qureshi, managing partner at crypto VC firm Dragonfly Capital, stated in an X post that his company passed on investing in Eclipse while conducting due diligence on the L2 solution. During the process, Dragonfly found a history of sexual harassment surrounding Somani. 









Qureshi concluded that the fact that Somani received funding and successfully sold millions in secondary for a pre-launch token despite his history is “embarrassing.”



On the other hand, Somani maintained his innocence, stating that he had never sexually assaulted a woman. He said that he’ll quit his role as the “public face” for Eclipse because it wouldn’t be fair to the team and the L2 solution “to have this situation weighing on their reputations,” adding:




“I’ll be temporarily reducing my role as a public face for Eclipse. The senior leaders at Eclipse are well equipped to take on these responsibilities and this will allow these conversations to unfold and the truth to emerge about these allegations.”




Further, in a statement, Eclipse stated that it “remains committed to maintaining the highest personal and professional standards, including gender equality and fair treatment.” The firm will closely monitor the situation and reveal details about the other senior members who are leading Eclipse.Eclipse co-founder Sam Thapaliya commented that his firm is “committed to upholding the highest standards of integrity and accountability” in all its operations.

Analysis of the crypto Qubic, Kaspa and Render

The crypto world is now extremely vast, and in this article we will analyze in particular the trends of Qubic, Kaspa and Render.

The recent performance of the crypto Qubic, Kaspa, and Render
Qubic is a new layer-1 project based on Proof-of-Work (PoW).
PoW is the consensus algorithm used by Bitcoin. Even Ethereum was initially based on PoW, but in September 2022 it switched to Proof-of-Stake (PoS).
Although initially most cryptocurrencies were based on PoW, now most of them are instead based on PoS, because it allows for greater scalability.
PoW, however, remains more secure, even though the level of security achieved by PoS is still high, and that’s why crypto projects based on PoW also survive. For example, Bitcoin is very unlikely to abandon it.
Qubic for example claims to be able to guarantee feeless transactions, even though it is based on PoW. It also claims to use artificial intelligence (AI).
The cryptocurrency QUBIC landed on the crypto markets at the end of 2023, with an initial price around 2.6 millionths of a dollar, although since the bull run had already started by then, the price rose to 5.4 thousandths already during the first week of presence on exchanges.
However, until early February it dropped, even significantly below the initial price, without benefiting from the December bull run. 
Nevertheless, starting from mid-February it began to benefit from the bullrun, rising up to 12.2 thousandths of a dollar. 
However, it was a speculative mini-bubble that burst starting from March. For example, when the price of Bitcoin reached its all-time high, Qbic had already dropped to 9 millionths of a dollar.
The price then continued to decrease, reaching the current 5.8 millionths. 
These seem to be predominantly speculative movements, and since Qbic only capitalizes half a billion dollars, it is possible that its price will remain volatile for a long time. 
At this moment it is difficult to imagine if the project has significant long-term development potential, and given the volatility at this moment its cryptocurrency should be considered a predominantly speculative asset. 
The trend of Kaspa 
Kaspa is also a crypto project based on PoW. 
However, this is a project that has been existing for almost two years, and so far it has grown almost constantly. 
His cryptocurrency KAS debuted on the crypto markets in May 2022, with an initial price of 0.2 thousandths of a dollar. 
Already in the course of the same 2022 it recorded a real first boom, with the price rising to over 9 thousandths of a dollar, and in 2023 the upward trend continued.
After the initial boom in 2022, it has recorded at least three more.
The second one was at the beginning of 2023, when taking advantage of the rebound in the crypto markets, the price of KAS even reached 37 cents. At that point, in less than a year, it had gained 18,000%. 
In light of this performance, it is possible to affirm that the initial price was widely underestimated, although surely the excellent start of 2023 for the crypto markets as a whole must have helped a lot. 
However, he then recorded two more booms, although with lower percentage gains. 
With the beginning of the bullrun, in October of last year, the price of KAS started to rise again, reaching 140 thousandths of a dollar ($0.14) in November. At that point, the initial +18,000% had added another +280%.
However, the crypto bullrun continued in 2024, and so in February the price of Kaspa rose to almost 180 cents of a dollar. 
Since then it has dropped a bit, even reaching below $0.14 in February. 
This trend suggests that the great bull run of Kaspa may have already run its course, and that it probably only served to bring KAS’s market capitalization to the level it deserved, above three billion dollars. 
This is a level comparable to Stellar’s XLM, and only slightly lower than that of CRO. In other words, although it is only in 38th place overall, Kaspa has now entered the ranks of the top 50 cryptocurrencies in the world. 
Prices and latest Render news
A different speech is instead the one concerning Render.
It is indeed a project born in 2020, before the last major bull run of the crypto markets.  
It does not have its own blockchain, but a token called RNDR on the Ethereum blockchain.
Although the price of this token has gone through the great bull run of 2021, its performance over time has remained extremely interesting.
The thing that stands out is that after reaching $7.8 in 2021, in the course of 2024 it managed to do better, setting a new all-time high in mid-March at $13.6. 
This is a remarkable performance, because while in mid-March Bitcoin set a new all-time high of about +6% compared to 2021, RNDR in 2024 performed even 74% better than 2021. 
Furthermore, having debuted on the crypto markets at 0.06$, the performance in 2021 was already remarkable: +13,000%.
It is also worth noting that during the bear market of 2022, the price only managed to return to $0.4, a figure much higher than the $0.1 it had before the start of the great bull run, and that before the start of the late 2023 bull run it had already returned to almost $2.5. 
So although it is a token with a decidedly volatile value, it seems to have an excellent long-term trend, at least up to now. 
It is no coincidence that it has a market capitalization of almost 4.4 billion dollars, which puts it ahead of Ethereum Classic and just slightly below UNI from Uniswap. 
It is difficult to say if this upward trend can last much longer, but for now its trend is definitely positive,

Prices and news of the crypto Solana, Dogecoin and Jupiter

Our column dedicated to the analysis of the crypto world is back: today we analyze three important assets, Solana (SOL), Dogecoin (DOGE) and Jupiter (JUP).

Prices and market statistics of the crypto Solana (SOL), Dogecoin (DOGE), Jupiter (JUP)
The current price of Solana (SOL) is 153.54 USD, marking an increase in the last hour of 0.76%, 5.87% in the last day, and 10.26% in the last week.
This performance shows a strong interest from investors towards Solana, placing it in fifth place in terms of popularity in the cryptocurrency market.
Its market capitalization is 68.9 billion USD, with a trading volume in the last 24 hours of 2.3 billion USD. The amount of SOL in circulation is 448.3 million units.
 Solana holders maintain their positions on average for 145 days, indicating a medium to long-term confidence in the project and its future prospects. The all-time high recorded for SOL was 260.00 USD, demonstrating that the currency has growth potential and can attract further investments. 
The current price of Dogecoin (DOGE) is 0.15 USD, showing an increase of 0.36% in the last hour, 2.63% in the last day, and 13.16% in the last week. 
This positive trend reflects a growing interest from investors in this cryptocurrency, ranked ninth in terms of popularity in the market. Dogecoin has a market capitalization of 21.8 billion USD and a trading volume in the last 24 hours of 1.1 billion USD.
 The circulating supply is 144.2 billion DOGE. Dogecoin holders maintain their positions on average for 85 days, indicating a moderate confidence in the currency. 
The all-time high for DOGE was 0.74 USD, suggesting that, despite its volatile nature, Dogecoin has the potential to reach higher valuations. 
The current price of Jupiter (JUP) is 1.11 USD, with a market capitalization of 1.5 billion USD. These data indicate a stable presence in the cryptocurrency market. 
The trading volume in the last 24 hours stands at 134.8 million USD, demonstrating active participation from investors. With a circulating supply of 1.4 billion JUP, this cryptocurrency shows a wide distribution among holders.
Jupiter has reached a historical high of 1.84 USD, suggesting that the value of JUP has the potential to grow beyond the current price, based on its historical performance. This historical peak provides an important reference point for investors interested in Jupiter’s future prospects in the competitive context of the cryptocurrency market.
NFT Solana: Explosive Growth in the Number of Traders, But Sales are Declining. What’s Happening?
Despite a surprising 111% increase in the number of traders in the NFT market on Solana, total sales are showing an opposite trend.
Recently, data has revealed that the volume of NFT sales on this blockchain has experienced a significant decline. This scenario raises questions about the dynamics behind the increasing interest of investors compared to the decrease in actual transactions.
The enthusiasm for NFTs on Solana is clearly visible from the increasing number of traders, attracted by the low transaction fees and fast processing that the network offers. 
However, the decrease in sales volume could be attributed to several factors. Among these, market saturation and changing investment trends play crucial roles.
Industry experts suggest that, as more individuals are exploring the NFT market as a potential source of income and collecting, caution has become predominant among buyers due to price fluctuations and general economic uncertainty. 
Furthermore, the exponential growth in the number of available NFTs may have made it more difficult for buyers to find unique works that offer long-term value, resulting in a lower frequency of high-profile sales.
This divergence between the entry of new traders and the decrease in sales highlights the complexity and volatility of the NFT market, and suggests that the future of this sector may depend not only on technological innovation, but also on a better understanding of market dynamics and investment strategies by participants.
Dogecoin (DOGE) Price on the Edge: the Threat of the Death Cross
Dogecoin, the popular meme coin, is in a critical phase, with the imminent threat of a death cross that could trigger a significant price correction. 
The death cross, a technical term used in trading to indicate the bearish crossover between the 50-day moving average and the 200-day moving average, is seen as a strong negative signal by market analysts.
In addition, the Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD), an indicator that helps identify changes in momentum and price direction, is showing signs of an imminent bearish crossover. This signal could further strengthen the already observed bearish trends, increasing pressure on traders.
The critical price area for Dogecoin is currently between $0.15 and $0.14, where approximately 12.46 billion DOGE are held. A drop below this level could trigger cumulative losses of around $1.8 billion, accentuating the climate of uncertainty and potential selling panic among investors.
This scenario highlights the intrinsic volatility of Dogecoin and other cryptocurrencies, emphasizing the importance for investors to carefully monitor market indicators and be prepared to adjust their strategies in response to rapid changes in the financial landscape.

Binance Fined by Canada’s FINTRAC Over Policy Breaches


							

Canada’s FINTRAC levied a $4.4 million penalty on Binance.



Binance failed to comply with AML laws, claims FINTRAC.



The regulator also found significant gaps in Binance’s compliance procedures.




Canada’s financial crime watchdog, the Financial Transactions and Reports Analysis Centre (FINTRAC), has fined Binance, the world’s largest cryptocurrency exchange by trading volume, a hefty penalty of 6 million Canadian dollars, equivalent to about $4.4 million USD. 



As per a report from Bloomberg, this fine comes as a consequence of Binance’s failure to comply with laws related to money laundering and terrorist financing.



Fintrac identified several administrative violations, including Binance’s failure to register as a foreign money-services business and its alleged failure to report large virtual currency transactions of C$10,000 or more, along with the required information. These violations point to significant gaps in Binance’s compliance procedures.



This latest penalty adds to Binance’s growing list of regulatory and legal issues. The exchange has been under scrutiny by various regulatory bodies, including the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). 









Last year, Binance faced accusations of prioritizing profits over user protection. In November, Binance pleaded guilty to violating U.S. anti-money-laundering regulations, resulting in a $4.3 billion fine. Additionally, the SEC has filed a civil lawsuit against Binance.



It is important to note that administrative penalties like the one imposed on Binance are aimed at encouraging businesses to change their behavior rather than being purely punitive. These penalties are intended to drive improvements in compliance practices across the industry. 



Under Canada’s Proceeds of Crime and Terrorist Financing Act, regulatory bodies like FINTRAC have the authority to issue such penalties in order to promote a more compliant and secure financial environment.

Shiba Doge Hybrid (SHIDOGE) to Surge 8,000% as MEXC Listing Announced, While Shiba Inu and Dogecoin Struggle



                    

Shiba Doge Hybrid (SHIDOGE) could turn early investors into multi-millionaires if it becomes a mainstream coin, like Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE).



Shiba Doge Hybrid (SHIDOGE), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is poised to explode over 8,000% in price in the coming days.




This is because SHIDOGE has announced its first centralized exchange listing, which will be on MEXC.



This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up.



Currently, Shiba Doge Hybrid (SHIDOGE) can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jupiter and Raydium, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days.




Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Shiba Doge Hybrid (SHIDOGE) could become the next viral memecoin.



To buy Shiba Doge Hybrid on Raydium or Jupiter ahead of the MEXC listing, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for SHIDOGE by entering its contract address – 797CmcxqkLZaSjMd7MdyNZ9swuSzaGdYWkJ65jehiXWa – in the receiving field.



In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price.



If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner.




The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum.



This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like SHIDOGE.

BlockFi partners with Coinbase for fund distribution, shuts down web platform

Bankrupt crypto lender BlockFi is completing its wind-down of operations, revealing its intention to shut down its web platform in May. BlockFi has partnered with Coinbase to allow clients to access and withdraw funds.In a blog post, the company stated that its collaboration with Coinbase will enable “eligible BlockFi Interest Accounts (BIA), Retail Loans, and Private Clients” to withdraw their funds.In November 2022, BlockFi declared bankruptcy following FTX’s collapse, and in 2023, BlockFi announced its closure and outlined plans to return customers’ crypto holdings, with a withdrawal request deadline set for April 28, 2024.The lender informed clients on Thursday, May 9, that as the deadline to withdraw digital assets from the current estate distribution has passed, they will receive instructions on setting up a Coinbase account to facilitate withdrawals, whether using an existing or new Coinbase account.Source: BlockFiThe company is providing an additional opportunity for verification via the BlockFi platform for those who missed the withdrawal deadline and the May 10 deadline. Clients who do not establish an approved Coinbase account may have their assets liquidated into cash and distributed accordingly.The plan administrator will continue to use Coinbase for upcoming distribution rounds, potentially involving recovered funds from FTX.BlockFi stated that it does not intend to partner with any other platforms for cryptocurrency distributions. Therefore, investors are advised to stay cautious to avoid potential scams from third-party entities.Related: FTX victims describe ‘irreparable harm’ ahead of Sam Bankman-Fried’s sentencingBlockFi has faced fraudulent activity in the past, with individuals receiving deceptive emails that mimicked legitimate communications, falsely claiming immediate withdrawals of their remaining balances.BlockFi reached an $875 million in-principle settlement with the estates of FTX and Alameda Research in March. The settlement resolved BlockFi’s claims against FTX, totaling approximately $1 billion, and also saw FTX waive “millions of dollars of avoidance claims and other counterclaims” against BlockFi.BlockFi’s CEO Zac Prince, who testified as a government witness in Sam Bankman-Fried’s criminal trial, said that the actions of the FTX founder directly led to BlockFi’s bankruptcy.In September 2023, the bankruptcy court approved BlockFi’s Chapter 11 plan to repay its 10,000 creditors. Estimates show BlockFi owes up to $10 billion to over 100,000 creditors, including $1 billion to its three largest creditors and $220 million to bankrupt crypto hedge fund Three Arrows Capital.Magazine: What do crypto exchanges really do with your money?

Luxor Q1 report predicts recovery in Bitcoin hashprice over next five months | CryptoSlate

Quick TakeThe Bitcoin mining sector has faced challenges with historically low hashprices in recent weeks following the halving event. However, hash prices surged to multi-year highs on the day of the halving, buoyed by increased fees attributed to Runes.According to Glassnode data, the hash price is $51,915 in USD terms and 0.84 BTC, nearing all-time lows. However, May 9 saw a recent uptick in hash price due to the biggest difficulty adjustment drop since November 2022.Miner Hashprice (Revenue Per Exahash): (Source: Glassnode)Glassnode defines the miner revenue per exahash metric as a tool for gauging daily miner earnings in relation to their proportional contribution to network hash power. It’s derived by dividing the total miner income (combining subsidies and fees) by the current hashrate (in EH/s). This data is provided on a daily basis, offering insights into the daily revenue earned per 1 EH/s of hash power contributed by miners to the network.Luxor, a mining pool and hashrate marketplace, released its Q1 2024 report on the state of Bitcoin mining. The report suggests that the hash price may have reached its bottom, at least in the short term, and anticipates a rise over the next five months. This projection is based on the expectation of either higher transaction fees or a decrease in mining difficulty.The report says:“This means that Luxor Hashrate Forward traders expect hashprice to increase over the next five months by way of either an increase in transaction fees or a decrease in Bitcoin mining difficulty”.Luxor Hashrate Forward Curve (06-May-24): (Source: Luxor)In addition, Luxor’s hashrate forwards are trading above the current spot price through October, also known as Contango.“Luxor’s Hashrate Forwards are trading in contango through October, which means that the contract prices for these forward contracts (which are essentially future contracts, although they trade OTC and not on an exchange) are trading above the current spot price”.The report suggests that hashrate traders are bullish on transaction fees in the short term.“Hashrate traders have been bullish on transaction fees, which they are baking into their expectations for hashprice in the coming months”.I see two potential scenarios for increased fees: First, if the Bitcoin bull run continues, we could see increased adoption and network congestion. Alternatively, another surge in Inscriptions and Runes could also drive up fees.

Memecoins & SocialFi Apps Drive Base Network’s Growth


							

The Ethereum Layer 2 network, Base, has seen a vast growth in adoption and activity.



Franklin Templeton hints at the emergence of a Base Season, reflecting on the platform’s growth.



The rise of SocialFi applications and the growth of Base memecoins have significantly contributed to the popularity of Base.




Base, a relatively new Ethereum Layer 2 network launched by Coinbase, has seen increasing adoption driven by the rise of SocialFi (Social Finance) applications and the growth of Base memecoins. Asset manager Franklin Templeton, in a recent X post, acknowledged the growing demand for Base as the emergence of a “Base Season.”







According to a recent report released by IntoTheBlock, the L2 networks of Ethereum stand out with unique user engagement and transaction management. Among the Ethereum L2s, Base has gained traction, boasting 1.48 million transactions per day.



The blockchain’s ability to maintain large-scale operations is one of the major reasons for the users’ preference for Base over other L2 networks. In addition, the supply of USDC on Base has also increased, currently exceeding $2.5 billion.









Franklin Templeton’s report spotted the surge of SocialFi applications like Friend.Tech is the key driver of the Base’s demand. While most of the crypto-related SocialFi apps are built on Base, more than 46% of transactions on Base are connected to these applications. The report stated, “[It is] positioning itself well to capture a material share of SocialFi activity and remain a leader in the Ethereum L2 sector going forward.’



Sharing insights on Base’s widening adoption and Franklin Templeton’s report, Chinese reporter Colin Wu posted a message on the X platform. Wu wrote, “Driven by memecoins and Friend tech, Base activity has increased significantly.”







Friend.Tech is one of the most popular SocialFi apps built on Base. Users can monetize their content through “key shares” or “tokenized attention.” The report asserted that the contribution of Friend.Tech in the growth of Base activity is much significant. The platform added that Coinbase has had a supporting hand in the growth as it helped the L2 network to capture about half of the SocialFi market share.

Marathon Digital's Mixed Q1: Growth Amid Setbacks


Marathon Digital Holdings, Inc., a US-based Bitcoin mining company, showcased a mixed financial performance in the first quarter 2024.
This period brought significant growth in hash rate and revenues. Yet, it also presented several operational challenges.
Marathon Digital Faced Financial and Operational Challenges Amidst Growth
Marathon’s Q1 2024 revenues soared by 223% compared with Q1 2023 to $165.2 million. Its net income rose 184% to $337.2 million from the same quarter in 2023.
Additionally, the company produced 2,811 BTC, a 28% increase from Q1 2023. However, compared to the Q4 2023, this figure marks a decrease of roughly 34%.

Read more: How Much Electricity Does Bitcoin Mining Use?
Fred Thiel, Marathon Digital’s CEO, explained the reason behind it. He cites unexpected equipment failures and maintenance issues adversely impacting the company’s Bitcoin production.

“Bitcoin production, and therefore revenues, generated during the quarter was negatively impacted by unexpected equipment failures, transmission line maintenance, and higher than anticipated weather-related curtailments at Garden City and other sites during the quarter,” Thiel stated.

Indeed, Marathon’s Bitcoin production trails behind Core Scientific, another US-based Bitcoin mining company. Core Scientific reported 2,825 Bitcoin (BTC) mined during Q1 2024.
Nonetheless, the start of 2024 has been a period of notable expansion for Marathon Digital. The company reported a 142% increase in its energized hash rate, reaching 27.8 exahash per second (EH/s). The figure is up from 11.5 EH/s in the same period last year.

Marathon also expanded its technological infrastructure and product offerings. This quarter saw the introduction of Anduro, a new multi-chain Bitcoin layer-two network. Anduro aims to foster Bitcoin’s development and adoption.
Moreover, Marathon launched several innovative products to enhance the efficiency and performance of Bitcoin mining operations. Among these were Slipstream, a service for speeding up Bitcoin transaction confirmations, and MARA UBC 2100, a control board developed internally to optimize mining operations.
Furthermore, the company has aggressively pursued expansion through acquisitions. It added more than 1.1 gigawatts to its mining capacity.

Notably, 54% of this capacity is now under Marathon’s direct control and operation. This strategic expansion is aligned with Marathon’s ambitious target. It aims to boost its hash rate to 50 EH/s by the end of 2024, doubling its current capacity.
However, Marathon’s overall performance in the quarter didn’t meet analysts at Zacks Equity Research’s estimation. Marathon’s reported revenues missed the Zacks consensus estimate by 14.80%. This led Zacks to adjust the current rank of Marathon Digital’s stock (MARA) status to “hold.”

Marathon Digital’s stock (MARA) price dropped after the earnings report. During after-hours trading, MARA’s price dipped to $18.60 on May 9. In a longer time frame, MARA’s price has been down 14.30% year-to-date.

Ethereum: for the SEC the crypto is a threat to banks

Joseph Lubin, co-founder of Ethereum and founder of Consensys, has released statements regarding the behavior of the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) of the USA against cryptocurrencies. 
According to Lubin, the SEC sees Ethereum as a threat to the banking landscape, and is acting to hinder innovation in the United States. 

Ethereum vs. SEC: according to Lubin, the crypto threatens banks and finance in the USA
At FT Live at the Crypto and Digital Asset summit in London, Joseph Lubin, co-founder of Ethereum and founder of Consensys, spoke about how the SEC is acting against cryptocurrencies.
Specifically, Lubin believes that the Securities and Exchange Commission of the United States is engaging in strategic enforcement actions, rather than having a meaningful dialogue with the cryptocurrency industry.
The lack of regulatory clarity and these actions against crypto, suggest that the SEC is intentionally hindering innovation, which threatens the current banking and financial landscape of the country.
And indeed, according to the co-founder of Ethereum, the actions of the SEC are intended to create fear, uncertainty, and doubt for the cryptocurrency industry “in an attempt to paralyze” and force the company to go offshore.
Regarding this, Lubin said:
“The SEC seems to have reclassified Ether as a security without telling anyone that it is doing so. It is proceeding with a strategic series of executive actions rather than an open discussion and a clear definition of the rules”
Ethereum vs. the SEC: the crypto ETF issue could further scare banks
Lubin then spoke about two other issues concerning the SEC against Ethereum. One is the decision by Consensys to sue the SEC, after receiving a Wells notice from the agency. 
Just with the goal of obtaining greater clarity, the company’s counteraction against the SEC will go to a US court. However, it is worth considering that the Commodity Futures Trading Commission had previously classified Ether ETH as a commodity.
On this subject, here is the tweet from Consensys that explains its position:

“It’s not just about protecting a digital asset, but safeguarding the future of innovation in the United States. It’s about safeguarding the future of innovation in the United States. An overly zealous financial regulator should not hold a revolutionary technology hostage.” – @ethereumjoseph in today’s edition of @FT”
The other issue regarding the SEC vs. Ethereum case, instead, concerns the upcoming deadline for Ethereum spot ETFs, which must be approved or rejected by the end of this month of May 2024. 
Here too, Lubin emphasizes that the SEC’s decision could depend on both the success of capital inflows for the Bitcoin spot ETF and the lack of readiness on the part of banks and the traditional financial system. 
In this sense, Lubin has also hypothesized that the perspective that customers in the banking sector will move assets into digital forms, using decentralized finance constructs, could scare many banks and other financial institutions.
Vitalik Buterin’s new revolutionary proposal: EIP-7702
And while on one hand there is concern about whether government and institutions are ready for the great Ethereum, on the other hand, the other co-founder of Ethereum, Vitalik Buterin, is dealing with his continuous technological progress. 
Recently, Buterin together with Sam Wilson, Ansgar Dietrichs and Matt Garnett, presented a new revolutionary proposal: EIP-7702.
Basically, the proposal aims to refine the concept of “account abstraction” on Ethereum. 
It proposes to introduce a new feature and capability to externally owned accounts (EOA), like normal wallets, allowing them to temporarily assume the functions of a smart contract during a transaction.

Solana Surpasses Ethereum in DEX Volume


Solana has managed to top Ethereum in 24-hour daily volume in decentralized exchanges, according to recent data. The two popular blockchains recorded $1.3 billion and $1.29 billion, respectively, in DEX trading volume. BSC comes in third place with $604 million worth of DEX trading volume. Arbitrum and Base are in fourth and fifth places after generating $510 million and $286 million in DEX trading volume, respectively. Another flippening? It is also worth noting that Solana’s total fees are now at 50% of Ethereum’s fees over the past few days. For comparison, the ratio was just 1% during the 2021 bull run. Some analysts expect Solana to flip Ethereum in fees this month, which would be a major development for the cryptocurrency ecosystem. However, it is worth noting that the capital moving to layer-2 solutions is one of the reasons for this changing dynamics. Solana surges 6% The price of the SOL cryptocurrency has surged more than 6% over the past 24 hours, which makes it one of the best-performing altcoins. The token is currently changing hands at $154 on major spot exchanges. Its market cap currently stands at $68 billion. For comparison, ETH is currently up a modest 1.23%. Yet, with its valuation of $365 billion, it still dwarfs Solana.

                        Rich Dad Poor Dad author and renowned investor Robert Kiyosaki believes that the US dollar is losing value and expressed his support over crypto investments.During a recent episode of the podcast “The Rich Dad Channel,” Kiyosaki discussed the importance of portfolio diversification including cryptocurrencies. Speaking to Andy Shechtman, CEO of Miles Franklin Precious Metals, Kiyosaki advocated investors to turn to gold, Bitcoin and Ethereum.He stressed that the dollar decline is imminent, which is why accumulating alternative investments is vital to be prepared for adverse financial conditions. “Our money is fake,” he noted.“It’s a reason to buy gold, silver, Bitcoin, and all this because our currency is screwed up now, it’s going to get worse because our debt keeps going up.”Kiyosaki revealed that he bought Ethereum “for the same reason.”Further, he criticized the lack of financial literacy education in schools, particularly when there is an already dire financial situation. Kiyosaki also pointed out the absence of counterparty risk issues when it comes to borrowing money.“If I borrow money, who’s the guy to pay me back? And gold and silver – you don’t need that – the same as Bitcoin, you have no counterparty risk.”
Kiyosaki’s Highly Bullish Bitcoin Stance
The bestselling author in March, described the world’s largest crypto – Bitcoin – as “the perfect asset at the right time.” However, he is also having a cautious approach to the asse-class, doubting its potential to be scam or Ponzi scheme.Kiyosaki has maintained a bullish stance on Bitcoin over the years. In November 2023, the financial educator said that Bitcoin is the “best protection” against hyperinflation because it is people’s money. He drew a historical comparison and urged his followers to consider Bitcoin as a means of protection against hyperinflation.However, he wasn’t keen on the spot Bitcoin ETFs, claiming that these financial products are apt for institutional investors. He rather favors direct ownership of physical assets due to his entrepreneurship pathway.Kiyosaki has invested in a mix of assets like gold, silver, Bitcoin, which according to him are bargains today.

Ethereum Spot ETF Dream Dashed? Expert Pessimistic On Approval Prospects | Bitcoinist.com


								Within the cryptocurrency investment space, there has been much debate and conjecture around the possibility of an Ethereum Spot Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs). However, in light of ongoing regulatory obstacles, senior Bloomberg Intelligence analyst Eric Balchunas has offered a gloomy view of the products, noting that the firm is now more pessimistic than ever about the likelihood of the funds being approved by the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).
Ethereum Spot ETF Pessimism Prevails
Eric Balchunas’ insights came in response to the Chief Executive Officer (CEO) of Fizen Leo Vu’s post regarding Grayscale’s CEO Michael Sonneshein’s optimism toward approval of Ethereum spot ETFs. According to Michael, he is very confident that the SEC will grant the company’s request to convert its Ethereum trust into a spot ETF.

Responding to the post, Balchunas expressed his displeasure with the CEO’s claims, highlighting his disagreement and Bloomberg’s constant pessimism toward the products. While Balchunas believes that the funds might be authorized in the foreseeable future, he thinks it will not happen within a year. However, the election in November and what Grayscale says about denial are significant factors that could trigger a shift in the forecast.
Balchunas further noted that Sonneshein mentioned that Grayscale decided to withdraw its ETH futures ETF filed under the Securities Act of 1933 because it wanted to concentrate more on its Spot ETF. Meanwhile, the major purpose of filing the ETH futures under the 1933 Act, as opposed to the 1940 Act, was to create a legal opening.
The expert thinks a potential reason why Grayscale made the move might be because they do not want to pay the whole cost once more to give Blackrock a massive ETF progress, as seen following the approval of the Bitcoin Spot ETFs while taking a lot of crap from people due to unlock outflows.
Shared View On Grayscale’s ETF Withdrawal
Balchunas’ insights have caused quite a stir in the crypto community. Scott Johnsson, a finance lawyer and author, has expressed his agreement with Bloomberg’s analyst overview.

Johnsson may be in line with Balchunas’s perspective on why Grayscale withdrew its Ethereum futures; however, he believes by taking such action, the firm displayed its true intentions. “Can I blame them? I don’t know, but don’t piss on my leg and tell me it’s raining,” he added.
He further stated that without pulling ETHE itself, Grayscale could not claim to be trying to convert ETHE while simultaneously engaging in the single most significant action to obstruct that objective.
Thus, Balchunas concurred with Johnsson saying that the part where he mentioned Grayscale taking a bunch of crap from people was due to high cost, which the company is to blame. “I’m not letting them off the hook for what they said re conversion but rather trying to get others to see it from their perspective/self-interest. When you do everything starts to make sense,” he added.
It is worth noting that the approval odds for Ethereum spot ETFs today now stand at merely 9%, indicating a nearly 90% drop since the first filings were made.

UAE's Crypto Scene Friendlier Than US Due to Political Stability


                        
                            UAE Offers Friendlier Crypto Scene Than US Due to Political Stability: Komodo CTO

                        Komodo CTO Kadan Stadlemann said the United Arab Emirates’ (UAE) political stability fosters a friendlier environment for crypto businesses to flourish, compared to the challenges they face in the US.In a jab at democracies, he said the UAE’s biggest advantage is its monarchy. The exec believes the UAE’s stable leadership, free from the back-and-forth policy changes of democracies, creates a more friendly environment for crypto businesses to grow.In an interview with CryptoNews, he credited the country’s “very stable political basis” as key to its startup friendliness. He also pointed to the UAE royal family’s “genius approach,” which he believes has laid the groundwork for the country’s booming economic growth.Stadlemann was attesting to the UAE making efforts to welcome crypto companies. All virtual asset service providers need to get licensed from the Virtual Asset Regulatory before they can operate there.The CTO also highlighted that UAE’s low crime rate creates a safe environment that supports business growth. He attributes this to strict laws that target crime effectively.On the other hand, he criticized the US for its overregulated crypto environment.
Crypto Exec Advocates For US Regulatory Reform for Crypto Growth
The Securities and Exchange Commission is typically called out for its “overreach” in handling crypto-related matters. In 2023, the regulator filed 46 enforcement actions within the industry and raked up fines worth $2.8b.“I believe the US (crypto economy) is being let down,” Stadelmann said. He added that he knows of several crypto projects that have chosen to relocate from the US to more welcoming regions like Latin America, Europe, Southeast Asia, and the UAE.“I believe they need industry experts involved, with all due respect. But I believe that’s what you get when you have a bunch of boomers and noobs try to regulate something they really literally don’t understand,” he said.“After years of struggle within the regulatory layer, you just get tired of it. And that’s kind of where we are.”The crypto exec called for a smarter approach to crypto regulation. He emphasized the industry’s wealth of expertise in core blockchain technology and its principles. This knowledge, he says, can be harnessed to develop regulations that protect investors and prevent illegal activity, without stifling innovation. Stadlemann believes regulators need to re-evaluate their current frameworks to find a more balanced approach.
Stadelmann’s Relocation Shows UAE Wins Crypto Talent as Netherlands Loses Grip
For over 7 years, Stadlemann part of the team at Komodo, an open-source, end-to-end blockchain and cryptocurrency platform. JL777, an anonymous leader, spearheaded Komodo’s creation in 2014. This decentralized platform allows developers across industries to conduct anonymous transactions.The exec now plans to relocate from Amsterdam to the UAE, leaving what he sees as growing hostility towards crypto in the Netherlands. This trend is also causing DEX and DeFi projects to depart the Netherlands.Facing regulatory hurdles in the Netherlands, Binance too pulled out of the Dutch market after failing to secure a virtual asset service provider license.Stadelmann cited Dubai’s “extremely startup friendly legal framework” as the reason behind his relocation.“I have a huge network of crypto entrepreneurs, and they’re following the same trend,” he said. “They are heading down to Dubai, to Abu Dhabi.”“I believe the UAE is going to take over the financial world and become the financial epicentre in regards to what Frankfurt London Zurich, New York, Chicago are today.”

                        Bitcoin Price PredictionBitcoin (BTC) dipped slightly by 0.20%, settling at $63,000, yet maintains a bullish stance in the latest bitcoin price prediction. The rise in jobless claims to 231,000, the highest since August 2023, suggests a cooling U.S. labour market, prompting anticipatory actions by the Federal Reserve.This could lead to rate reductions earlier than projected, influencing Bitcoin’s appeal as a non-traditional investment.
U.S. Jobs Data Sparks Rate Cut Speculation—What’s Next for BTCThe Labor Department reported a notable increase in initial jobless claims for the week ending May 4, reaching 231,000—22,000 more than the previous week and well above the Dow Jones estimate of 214,000. This marks the highest level since August 26, 2023, signalling possible economic strains and a cooling labour market that had previously shown resilience.Initial Jobless Claims – Source: Tradingeconomics Continuing claims also increased, rising by 17,000 to 1.78 million, while the four-week moving average of claims climbed to 215,000. These figures suggest a gradual economic slowdown, prompting discussions about the Federal Reserve’s potential early rate cuts to stimulate growth. Such a softening in the labour market has historically been a catalyst for Bitcoin price as investors turn to non-traditional assets.
Nonfarm Payroll Adds to ConcernApril’s nonfarm payroll data added to these concerns, showing a gain of only 175,000 jobs, far below the expected 240,000. This was the smallest increase since October 2023. However, the unemployment rate remains stable at 3.9%, under 4% since February 2022, indicating that the job market is not in crisis but may be normalizing.Analysts Christopher Rupkey and Robert Frick have noted the volatility and surprising rise in jobless claims, suggesting potential further fluctuations in the labour market. Officials of the Federal Reserve, whose goal is to maintain a 2% inflation rate, carefully examine these circumstances.
The recent spike in U.S. jobless claims suggests a potential economic slowdown.
April’s modest job gains and stable unemployment hint at market normalization.
The Fed may cut rates sooner, possibly boosting Bitcoin investment as lower rates reduce fixed-income asset yields.
As expectations mount for the Fed to ease monetary policy in response to a weakening job market, possibly starting rate cuts as early as September, Bitcoin could benefit. Lower interest rates make riskier assets like cryptocurrencies more appealing. Bitcoin Price PredictionBitcoin (BTC) observes a minor decline of 0.20%, with the current trading price at $63,000, however, bitcoin price prediction still remains bullish.The pivot point at $61,011 sets the stage for determining directional movements, with immediate resistance observed at $64,851. Should bullish momentum prevail, subsequent resistance levels at $67,084 and $69,356 could be tested.Bitcoin Price Prediction – Source: TradingviewConversely, immediate support forms at $58,852, with further downside protection seen at $56,677 and $54,327. The RSI at 54 indicates a relatively neutral market stance, while the 50-day EMA at $62,375 provides underlying support near the $62,000 mark, suggesting a balanced yet cautious market sentiment.A decisive move below $62,500 could trigger a significant selling trend, highlighting the importance of this threshold in BTC’s near-term price actions.

R. Kiyosaki's stark warning: Stop living in Disneyland and prepare for depression


Not long after stressing that a financial crash was already here and that it would be a ‘bad one,’ the popular investor and author of the best-selling personal finance book ‘Rich Dad Poor Dad,’ Robert Kiyosaki, has warned his followers to get ready for a depression instead of living in ‘Disneyland.’
As it happens, Kiyosaki said he didn’t want a depression to happen but that “it is better to be preparing for the worse rather than live in Disneyland, which most people are doing,” adding that “for years,” he could “see this crisis coming,” as he elaborated in an X post on May 9.
Specifically, as examples of things he was doing to prepare for the crisis he saw coming years ago, the finance educator listed writing his ‘Rich Dad Poor Dad’ book, starting his own business, using debt as money to buy cash-flowing assets such as rental properties, and saving gold, silver, and Bitcoin (BTC).


Additionally, he pointed out the opportunities that such a time can offer for those well-prepared for it, even arguing that “depression can be the perfect time to get rich, really rich,” telling his followers to “stop living in Disneyland and prepare to get rich… very rich.”

Getting rich during crash
As a reminder, when sharing his earlier warning of a particularly ugly crash and his rules to stand by during such a time, Kiyosaki also expressed his view that “crashes are the best time to get rich” because “bargains will float to the surface,” as Finbold reported on May 3.
Back in early April, he also highlighted that “most people have no idea” what the previous confession by United States Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell that inflation was higher than expected meant for them or their families or to the world,” and that, in simple language, it meant “we’re F’d.”
At the same time, the author continues to advise saving gold, silver, and Bitcoin instead of the “fake money” like the US dollar, arguing that the rich save the above assets, while the poor and middle-class work for fiat, which they then invest in stocks, bonds, mutual funds, and exchange-traded funds (ETFs).

Veteran Trader Peter Brandt Warns Of Impending Regulatory Crackdown On Crypto Staking: 'It's Going To Be A Bloodbath' - Benzinga

Veteran trader Peter Brandt has sparked a discussion within the cryptocurrency community with his recent remarks on X.What Happened: On Thursday, Brandt predicted a severe regulatory crackdown on crypto staking, describing the future landscape as a “bloodbath.” “If the crypto community is upset over the @SECGov treatment of $XRP, $ETH et al as securities, Prediction: Wait until the @USOCC @SECGov @USTreasury do a full assault attack over staking It’s going to be a bloodbath,” he wrote.Brandt’s comments reflect concerns over potential aggressive actions from not only the SEC but also the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) and the U.S. Treasury.See Also: Bitcoin, Ethereum, Dogecoin Trade Sideways, Trader Asks: ‘Does It Matter If You Buy Bitcoin At $62,000 OrWhy It Matters: There have been a series of legal challenges and regulatory actions that have heightened tensions within the crypto market. A recent court ruling against Coinbase Global Inc. COIN largely dismissed the company’s motion to fend off SEC allegations of unregistered securities activity, particularly concerning its staking program.Furthermore, the market has seen significant volatility with major cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin BTC/USD and Ethereum ETH/USD experiencing price dips following regulatory scrutiny. Notably, Robinhood Markets Inc. HOOD reported a substantial increase in crypto trading volume despite receiving a Wells notice from the SEC, indicating a complex and defiant landscape.Amid these developments, Ethereum co-founder Joseph Lubin has accused the SEC of hampering the growth of the crypto sector. His company, Consensys, is embroiled in a legal battle with the SEC over Ethereum’s classification. Additionally, the U.S. House of Representatives has taken a stand against the SEC’s crypto custody rules, a move that President Joe Biden has vowed to block, further highlighting the contentious regulatory environment.Read Next: Here’s How Much $1,000 Invested In Dogecoin Would be Worth If You Invested When Elon Musk First Tweeted About DOGEImage via Shutterstock

Ripple Teams up to Build a Secret Management Protocol


Ripple, the issuer of XRP tokens, has formed a strategic alliance with Algorand and Hedera, aiming to revolutionize secret management. 
This partnership inaugurates the DeRec Alliance, which also includes Swirlds Labs and XRPL Labs among its founding members.
What is DeRec Alliance?
The DeRec Alliance is dedicated to enhancing digital asset recovery through an open-source protocol. This system allows for the secure and confidential recovery of digital secrets, such as passwords and keys, using a method based on secret sharing.
Founding members, including Ripple, are pivotal in the Technical Oversight Committee (TOC). They influence governance and policies that shape the future of digital asset security. The TOC provides expert oversight and direction, which is critical in guiding the alliance’s strategic initiatives.
Read more: What is a Private Key in Crypto?

The demand for such a system has surged as digital asset adoption increases. Traditional recovery methods often leave assets at risk or completely irrecoverable if the owners lose their keys. 
For example, Rain Lõhmus of LHV Bank cannot access 250,000 Ethereum worth over $700 million. Also, former Ripple CTO Stefan Thomas is locked out of a Bitcoin (BTC) wallet due to a forgotten password. Thomas’ 7,000 BTC are worth over $441 million.

The DeRec protocol involves a network of ‘helpers’ – either friends or businesses – who each hold a part of a user’s digital secret. If the user loses access to their device or data, these helpers can collaboratively reconstruct the secret. This system ensures that no single helper accesses the complete secret, maintaining high security and redundancy without compromising privacy.
Additionally, the system is designed to automatically adapt to changes, such as when helpers join or leave. This feature maintains the integrity of the secret, ensuring continuous security despite changes in the user’s network of helpers.

“The DeRec Alliance addresses one of the biggest challenges facing mainstream crypto adoption—secure and user-friendly management of private keys. By establishing clear standards for key recovery, this collaboration across the crypto industry empowers individuals to take control of their digital assets with confidence,” Markus Infanger, Senior Vice President of RippleX, said.

Despite progress, Ripple faces ongoing legal challenges from the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). For instance, on May 7, the SEC objected to Ripple’s plan of issuing a “new unregistered crypto asset.”

However, the SEC has not mentioned more details about the new crypto asset.

'Age of Ethereum' Incoming for 5 Key Reasons

Despite some skepticism, Ethereum has five compelling reasons that it has a bright future, presented from a balanced perspective.Superior ecosystem compared to Bitcoin’s L2:While Bitcoin's layer-2 (L2) applications are developing, they currently lag behind Ethereum in terms of functionality and user experience. Ethereum has established itself as the preferred platform for developers, largely due to its more mature ecosystem and broader acceptance. Despite the noise around Bitcoin’s potential for application development, Ethereum remains the go-to for developers looking for robust, tested and versatile solutions.ETH/USD Chart by TradingViewRegulatory challenges may not be pivotal:There is a lot of talk about the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) possibly classifying Ethereum as a security. However, the outcome of this regulatory scrutiny is still uncertain. Even if Ethereum faces some regulatory hurdles, its integral role in the finance and tech sectors — backed by significant support from big tech and traditional finance (tradfi) asset managers — suggests it could withstand potential challenges.Scalability and competition from Solana:Solana has been marked as a more scalable blockchain platform with faster growth in applications. However, its scalability benefits are accompanied by technical risks and less diversity in the client base compared to Ethereum.Adoption by major financial players:Major financial institutions like Visa, MasterCard, JP Morgan and Citibank have explored blockchain solutions separate from Ethereum. Yet, the interoperability and established network of Ethereum could eventually attract these giants. The blockchain’s ability to operate on a trustless, global scale makes it an attractive backbone for future financial operations.Symbiotic relationship with layer-2 solutions:There is a misconception that value primarily accrues to layer-2 technologies rather than Ethereum itself. In reality, Ethereum and its layer-2 solutions enjoy a symbiotic relationship. The success of applications running on Ethereum's network enhances the core platform's value, akin to how railways benefit from the businesses they enable.

Dogecoin (DOGE) Appears Headed for a 'Golden Cross'

During DOGE's early 2021 run, interest rates were near or below zero worldwide, which catalyzed unprecedented risk-taking across all corners of the financial market. That's not the case any more, with rates in the U.S., the world's largest economy, at multiyear highs above 5%.

Livepeer (LPT) Coin is Trending: Announcement Coming Up for Web3 Social Media Platform | Cryptopolitan

Livepeer (LPT) undergoes another boom cycle with a vertical price climb. LPT reached $19.33, within one price move from its yearly peak above $25. Demand for the token led LPT to a monthly peak in trading volumes above $106M in 24 hours. In 2024, LPT achieved two other vertical climbs and moved to a higher tier as interest returned to Web3 projects. The hope for LPT is to return to its all-time peak, when the token traded above $68 during the 2021 bull market. LPT remains at risk for deep corrections. Its most active trading pair on Binance, LPT/USDT, has only $181K liquidity for 2% slippage.LPT Shifts Trading ProfileIn the past month, the LPT trading profile has also shifted as tokens moved to a different set of exchanges. Binance and Coinbase marked net withdrawals for LPT, while the tokens flowed into OKX, Gate.IO, and other small exchanges.The token may undergo rapid inflows and outflows due to limited arbitrage opportunities. There is a disparity in LPT pairings, which may explain the increased trading activity.Livepeer was also selected as one of the projects in Grayscale’s portfolio, and it became the top performer during the latest rally. LPT stands out as a blue chip when decentralized storage and computing tokens are also expanding. The LPT rally follows highly active days for Render (RNDR), Akash Network (AKN) and AIOZ Network (AIOZ).Livepeer Aims for Development Beyond Short-Term Price HypeLivepeer has a long-term goal of building the world’s decentralized video infrastructure. The project aligns with the trending DePIN projects that focus on distributed computation and infrastructure. In May, Livepeer is boosting its social media profile with a pre-announcement. Livepeer will present its network upgrade and new tools to combine AI and video streaming during the ETH Berlin meetup. Livepeer aims to grow its influence, targeting content creators and developers. The project claims to offer 80% lower costs than existing cloud and video streaming services. All video streaming is supported by the globally available Livepeer Network, which combines user resources for lag-free streaming. Livepeer also boosted its brand in 2023, by creating enterprise products for prominent social media companies. So far, Livepeer has onboarded partners like Fishtank LIVE, Minds, Switchboard, The Lot Radio, and MyPrize. Independent creators can also use open-source Livepeer API to stream on demand. Livepeer Stands Behind Video VerificationLivepeer is also focusing on emerging problems with streamed content. With the rise of AI, the veracity of every video may be questioned. Livepeer is researching tools to prevent fake content and AI-generated fakes. Reliable and verified video is key, as Livepeer strives to grow the adoption of its flagship product, Livepeer Studio. Livepeer aims to become a key player in the growth industry of video streaming. In 2023, global streaming reached $553B and is projected to grow to 671.8B by the end of 2024. Video streaming still depends on AWS usage and other centralized cloud services. Blockchain projects are trying to achieve better pricing and access to grab a piece of the expanding market.Recent studies show decentralized streaming may be taking off this year. In April, Livepeer marked 30% growth compared to Q4, 2023. Through a series of updates and development over the years, Livepeer achieved the current network potential. The Livepeer Network itself is scalable, but the LPT asset remains an Ethereum-based token. Livepeer distributed its tokens in 2018 before developing its streaming service to ensure widespread holding of the tokens. Around 30% of all LPT tokens are in an escrow treasury. LPT also has 12% of its supply stored in a Binance wallet, suggesting sellers may be waiting in the sidelines to take profits. But LPT also has long-term holders, and has been distributed to more than 2.2 million wallets over the past six years. LPT tokens also have key utility and are used by streamers to pay for online resources. As streamers grow, so does demand for LPT. Network “orchestrators” receive the tokens as payment from streamers, who require the CPU, GPU, and bandwidth resources for on-demand streaming.

Bitcoin Is Getting Less Difficult To Mine After Halving - But Is That A Good Or Bad Sign? - Benzinga

Bitcoin BTC/USD miners may heave a sigh of relief as the network experienced its largest negative difficulty adjustment since November 2022. What Happened: The Bitcoin blockchain underwent its fourth negative difficulty adjustment for the year, according to CryptoQuant's Head of Research Julio Moreno, making it easier for the halving-battered sector to produce blocks and generate new Bitcoins. The mining difficulty is adjusted every 2.016 blocks, or roughly two weeks, to ensure block production time remains at 10 minutes. It is positively correlated with hash rate, the computational power dedicated by miners.The latest 5.7% drop in difficulty comes as a likely response to the 10% decline in the 7-day moving average of the hash rate from 655 EH/s on the halving day to 586 EH/s as of May 10, according to Hash Rate Index. Why It Matters: The quadrennial halving that slashed block rewards, severely impacted miners' revenue streams. CryptoQuant's Moreno noted, "As revenue has declined sharply after the halving, Miners are currently underpaid by the most since March 2020, the COVID crash." The loss in earnings prompted many participants, particularly those operating on a small scale, to turn off their machines and abandon the market. This caused a hash rate decline and subsequently led to a negative difficulty adjustment.The sentiment was echoed by Luxor mining pool CEO Nick Hansen who reportedly told Decrypt, "If there isn't enough margin for miners to make a profit, they turn off, which causes the hash rate to go down.”That said, CEO of mining firm Optiminer Scott Noris pointed out that this bodes well for the sector’s future growth. "The miners who planned properly will grow or the ones who turned off will get newer tech and find cheaper energy while everyone waits for the price to reflect the halving," he told Decrypt.With difficulty lowered and competition lessened, mining costs could decrease, providing temporary relief for the sector.Miners earn the majority of their revenues through fixed subsidies from every block produced. Halvings attack this very component severely, as each occurrence reduced rewards by 50%. Price Action: At the time of writing, Bitcoin was trading up 2.81% at $62919.46, according to data from Benzinga Pro.Read Next: Joseph Lubin Accuses SEC Of Stifling Crypto Growth Amid Legal ShowdownPhoto by Gaston Cerliani on Shutterstock

Cardano Founder Charles Hoskinson Says Voting For Biden Is A 'Vote Against American Crypto Industry' - Benzinga

Charles Hoskinson, the founder of Cardano ADA/USD, has accused President Joe Biden of actively working to stifle the Bitcoin BTC/USD and cryptocurrency industry in the United States.What Happened: Hoskinson, in a video posted on social media platform X on Thursday, criticized the Biden administration for its alleged efforts to “destroy the American cryptocurrency industry,” reported Cointelegraph.The Cardano founder pointed out that the U.S. government has been detrimental to the crypto industry through various means, including restricted access to bank accounts and the Securities and Exchange Commission’s policy of regulation by enforcement. He also criticized the White House for obstructing the legislative process."A vote for Biden is a vote against the American cryptocurrency industry," Hoskinson said.Hoskinson’s comments were in response to a statement from the White House, indicating that President Biden would veto legislation aimed at overturning SEC guidelines that discourage banks from holding crypto assets."The [Trump] administration had its issues but mostly ignored our industry. The Biden administration has engaged in a coordinated effort to kill crypto," Hoskinson said.See Also: Bitcoin, Ethereum, Dogecoin Dip After Robinhood Gets Wells Notice From SEC — Analyst Says ETHs Weak Fundamentals A ‘Roadblock’ For King CryptoHe also criticized the SEC for using outdated legislation that he believes should not apply to new and emerging asset classes. Hoskinson cited other countries such as Switzerland, Singapore, and Dubai, which have welcomed crypto companies and reaped the benefits of substantial investments.Notably, Hoskinson’s comments were challenged by a Twitter user who pointed out that the Trump administration had also been unsupportive of crypto. Hoskinson, however, stood by his claims, asserting that the Biden administration’s stance was “completely wrong.”Why It Matters: The Biden administration’s approach to cryptocurrency has been a subject of debate and scrutiny. The House of Representatives recently voted in favor of a resolution seeking to overturn a controversial SEC cryptocurrency accounting directive, indicating a growing divide between legislative preferences and executive defense of regulatory measures.Earlier in March, a poll revealed that former President Donald Trump was the top choice for U.S. voters who own cryptocurrencies. This indicates a potential shift in voter sentiment towards the Biden administration’s handling of the crypto industry.On the other hand, Trump has recently publicly endorsed cryptocurrency, positioning it as a significant election issue, which contrasts with President Biden’s perceived unfamiliarity with the crypto world.Read Next: Trump Pledges To ‘Make Sure You Can’ Donate Using Crypto To His 2024 Campaign — Unwittingly Sends Memecoin Parodying Biden SurgingImage Via Shutterstock Engineered by Benzinga Neuro, Edited by Kaustubh BagalkoteThe GPT-4-based Benzinga Neuro content generation system exploits the extensive Benzinga Ecosystem, including native data, APIs, and more to create comprehensive and timely stories for you.

Ethereum ETF Applications: Is There Potential For New Breakthrough? - Coincu



	

Following the groundbreaking approval by the SEC of 11 spot Bitcoin ETFs on January 10, attention now turns to the potential approval of spot Ethereum ETFs in 2024. Notable contenders leading the charge in Ethereum ETF applications include VanEck, BlackRock, and ARK Invest, underscoring the Escalating interest from major financial institutions in cryptocurrency-based investment products. Let’s take a look at the companies participating in this race with Coincu.




				
			


Overview of spot Ethereum ETF



What is a spot Ethereum ETF?



Functioning akin to traditional ETFs, spot Ethereum ETFs are managed by institutions that commit to purchasing and holding Ethereum (ETH) in their reserves.



These ETFs are subsequently listed on conventional stock exchanges, where they issue shares representing ownership of the ETF. Traders can then gain exposure to the real-time price movements of Ethereum through trading these shares, as they reflect the value of the ETH held by the institution.





It’s essential to understand that while owning shares of a spot Ethereum ETF provides exposure to the ETF’s underlying ETH reserves, it does not equate to direct ownership of individual ETH tokens. Shareholders hold claims on the value of the ETH holdings rather than the cryptocurrency itself.



Moreover, institutions managing the ETF may employ various strategies with the underlying ETH, such as lending it out or engaging in staking activities, in a bid to potentially enhance returns for the ETF.

How Does a Spot Ethereum ETF Work?



A spot Ethereum ETF operates as a pool where traders contribute funds to purchase Ethereum directly. Unlike futures-based ETFs, which track Ethereum’s price using derivatives like ETH futures, spot Ethereum ETFs hold the actual Ether coins to mirror the cryptocurrency’s price movements. Here’s how it works:



Spot Ethereum ETF buying structure



When investors buy shares of a spot Ethereum ETF, their funds are pooled together to acquire Ethereum coins. The value of the ETF shares then correlates with the price of Ether. If the price of Ethereum increases, the value of the ETF shares rises proportionally, and conversely, if the price of Ethereum decreases, the value of the ETF shares declines.



Behind the scenes, the ETF manager plays a crucial role in ensuring that the ETF accurately reflects the real-time market value of Ethereum. To maintain alignment with Ethereum’s price fluctuations, the manager may engage in activities such as creating and redeeming units, which involve exchanging large blocks of ETF shares for the underlying Ether or vice versa.





Exposure to ETH price



Despite the manager’s efforts to keep the ETF’s value in line with Ethereum’s price, slight disparities may occur due to factors such as trading costs and the frequency of rebalancing. Nonetheless, the goal of a spot Ethereum ETF is to provide investors with a convenient and transparent means of gaining exposure to Ethereum’s price movements without the complexities associated with directly owning and managing the cryptocurrency.

Benefits of spot Ethereum ETF



Ethereum ETFs offer several compelling benefits for investors looking to participate in the Ethereum market without the intricacies of directly managing digital assets. Here are some key advantages:





Ethereum ETFs enable investors to tap into the Ethereum market without the need to directly own and manage the cryptocurrency through traditional exchanges. By including Ethereum ETFs in their investment strategy, individuals can spread their risk across multiple assets, potentially mitigating losses if one asset underperforms.






Ethereum ETFs are typically available on public exchanges, making it convenient for investors to buy and sell shares during regular trading hours. Unlike purchasing and managing Ethereum directly, which can involve navigating various cryptocurrency exchanges and wallets, investing in an Ethereum ETF streamlines the process, offering a familiar and straightforward investment avenue.





One of the notable advantages of investing in Ethereum ETFs is the assurance of professional management. With an ETF, investors entrust the oversight and security of their digital assets to seasoned experts who manage the fund on their behalf. 



Instead, they can rely on the expertise of ETF managers to navigate the dynamic cryptocurrency market and make informed investment decisions that align with the interests of shareholders.





Storing and securing Ethereum tokens can be a daunting task, requiring knowledge of cybersecurity best practices and constant vigilance against potential threats. 





By investing in Ethereum ETFs, individuals can sidestep the risks associated with hosting wallets and safeguarding private keys. Instead, the responsibility for safeguarding digital assets falls on the ETF custodians and managers, who employ robust security measures to protect investors’ holdings.

List of All Companies That Have Applied for Spot Ethereum ETFs



The SEC is in the midst of its second round of reviews for spot Ethereum ETFs. This process involves examining applications from various issuers, with at least eight major players currently awaiting approval.



Among those seeking approval for Ethereum Spot ETFs are industry giants like Fidelity, BlackRock, Invesco with Galaxy, Grayscale, Hashdex, 21 Shares with ARK, VanEck, and Franklin Templeton. Each of these issuers has submitted applications for ETFs tied to Ethereum, highlighting the growing interest in cryptocurrency-based investment products.



Top Ethereum ETF Applications



VanEck



Among the leading Ethereum ETF applications is VanEck, which made headlines as the first to file for an Ethereum ETF spot in September 2023.



BlackRock



Following closely behind is BlackRock, a major player in the financial industry, which submitted its Ethereum ETF application in November of the same year, signaling its interest in entering the Ethereum ETF market.



ARK Invest



Another significant contender is ARK Invest, known for its innovative approach to investment strategies. ARK Invest filed for its Ethereum ETF last September, joining the ranks of institutions seeking approval to offer investors exposure to the burgeoning cryptocurrency market through ETFs.



Other Ethereum ETF Applications



Fidelity



Fidelity, a renowned name in the investment management industry, filed for its Ethereum ETF in November 2023. With its extensive experience and reputation in the financial sector, Fidelity’s entry into the Ethereum ETF market underscores the broadening appeal of cryptocurrencies among traditional investors. The Fidelity Ethereum Fund would be made available to the public on the Cboe BZX Exchange upon approval.



Invesco Galaxy



Another notable Ethereum ETF application is Invesco Galaxy, which submitted its application for an Ethereum ETF in October 2023. Invesco Galaxy’s involvement in the Ethereum ETF space reflects the continued expansion of offerings within the cryptocurrency investment landscape as established players seek to provide investors with diverse opportunities to access digital assets.



Hashdex



In September, the Nasdaq stock exchange submitted a request to list the Hashdex Nasdaq Ethereum ETF with the SEC. Toroso Investments, a member of the National Futures Association and a certified commodity pool operator with the Commodities Futures Trading Commission, oversees and manages the fund.



Grayscale



Grayscale, a prominent cryptocurrency asset management firm, is also seeking approval for its Ethereum ETF after filing its Ethereum ETF application in October 2023. Grayscale’s entry into the Ethereum ETF market further validates the growing institutional interest in cryptocurrencies and demonstrates confidence in the potential of Ethereum as a leading blockchain platform.



Hashdex, a global asset management firm specializing in cryptocurrency investments, filed for its Ethereum ETF in September 2023.



Franklin Templeton



Franklin Templeton has officially entered the competition for Ethereum ETFs, as confirmed in a filing on February 12. With an approval deadline set for November 2024, the asset manager has outlined its strategy, which notably deviates from conventional approaches seen in the industry.



Unlike some competitors, Franklin Templeton’s proposal emphasizes cash creations and redemptions, eschewing the typical in-kind transactions involving direct crypto transfers.



In its filing, Franklin Templeton disclosed its choice of custodians, highlighting Coinbase Custody for cryptocurrency custody and the Bank of New York Mellon for cash custody, administration, and transfer agency services.



Background of Ethereum ETF Applications



VanEck



VanEck, a seasoned player in the financial industry with a focus on mutual funds and ETFs, has been striving to establish a foothold in the cryptocurrency market for several years. While its attempts to launch a bitcoin ETF in the United States have encountered setbacks, the firm has maintained its pursuit of opportunities in the digital asset space.



In 2021, VanEck Europe, an arm of the company responsible for approximately 50 ETFs traded on stock exchanges throughout Europe, introduced the VanEck Crypto and Blockchain Innovators UCITS ETF. This ETF, designed to tap into the potential of the crypto and blockchain sectors, offers exposure to a diversified portfolio that includes prominent companies such as Coinbase Global, Block, Marathon Digital, Bitfarms, and MicroStrategy, alongside other smaller allocations.





Despite its relative novelty in the market, the VanEck Crypto and Blockchain Innovators UCITS ETF has quickly gained traction among investors. It has emerged as one of the top-performing ETFs within VanEck Europe’s portfolio, ranking among the top 15 by assets under management. The fund’s performance has been marked by considerable volatility, distinguishing it from many other products offered by VanEck Europe.



BlackRock



BlackRock, the globe’s largest asset manager, submitted a proposal for a Bitcoin ETF to the SEC last June. The announcement has injected fresh enthusiasm into the crypto market, leading to a remarkable recovery.



The significance of BlackRock’s venture into the realm of Bitcoin ETFs extends beyond mere market dynamics. It serves as a validation of cryptocurrencies and underscores the broader trend within the global financial ecosystem towards embracing digital assets. The proposal not only reflects growing institutional interest in cryptocurrencies but also suggests a shifting paradigm in how traditional finance views digital currencies as a legitimate asset class.





Earlier this year, the financial behemoth made headlines by launching its inaugural tokenized fund on the Ethereum blockchain. Dubbed the BlackRock USD Institutional Digital Liquidity Fund, or BUIDL, this initiative is fully backed by cash, U.S. Treasury bills, and repurchase agreements. The fund offers investors an opportunity to earn U.S. dollar yields within the crypto space, marking a significant milestone in the convergence of traditional finance and digital assets.



With BlackRock looking forward to its spot Ethereum ETF, this isn’t the first time BlackRock has dipped its toes into the crypto waters.



ARK Invest



ARK Invest and 21Shares have jointly registered a spot Ether ETF. This innovative fund has commenced trading on the Cboe BZX Exchange, leveraging the CME CF Ether-Dollar Reference Rate – New York Variant.



ARK always expects a “power law distribution” within the cryptocurrency market. This theory posits that a select few cryptocurrencies will emerge to dominate the majority of value and market share—a concept that could reshape investment strategies in the digital asset realm.





The registration of the spot Ether ETF marks a significant step forward in providing investors with regulated exposure to Ethereum, the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization. The ETF is sponsored by 21Shares, with Delaware Trust Company serving as the trustee and Coinbase Custody Trust Company acting as the custodian.



Fidelity



As interest in cryptocurrency began to rise in the mid-2010s, Fidelity recognized the need to adapt to evolving investor preferences.



In response to the growing interest in cryptocurrency among investors, Fidelity, one of the largest asset managers and brokerages in the U.S., made a significant move into the digital currency space in mid-October 2018. The company launched Fidelity Digital Assets, a limited liability corporation aimed at serving institutional customers seeking exposure to the burgeoning cryptocurrency market.





Fidelity Digital Assets offers a range of services tailored to institutional clients, including offline cold storage custody solutions and trade execution. Leveraging its position as a major financial services firm, Fidelity aims to provide comprehensive digital asset investment solutions to financial institutions.



Recognizing the potential of blockchain technology in the financial sector, Fidelity further expanded its commitment to cryptocurrency by tasking the Blockchain Incubator section of its research and development team, known as the Fidelity Center for Applied Technology (FCAT), with exploring cryptocurrency investing solutions for institutional investors.



Invesco Galaxy



Galaxy Asset Management, a prominent player in the global digital assets investment landscape, boasts an impressive $5.3 billion in assets under management (AUM). The firm stands out for its commitment to providing investors with institutional-grade access to the dynamic digital assets ecosystem. Offering a diverse suite of over a dozen investment vehicles, Galaxy caters to a wide range of investment preferences, including passive, active, and venture strategies.





Invesco Ltd., on the other hand, is an established American independent investment management company headquartered in Atlanta, Georgia. With branch offices spanning across 20 countries, Invesco has cemented its position as a key player in the financial services sector. Notably, its common stock is a constituent of the S&P 500 index and is actively traded on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE).



Galaxy in partnership with Invesco to launch the Invesco Galaxy Bitcoin ETF (BTCO) in January. With their eyes on the crypto industry, they went ahead with the spot Ethereum ETF.



Hashdex



Hashdex has been carving pathways to prosperity since its establishment in 2018. With a mission to democratize access to the crypto ecosystem worldwide, Hashdex has garnered trust from investors, overseeing a substantial $849 million in client assets. These funds not only empower innovative investors but also facilitate their entry into the burgeoning crypto economy.



Among its notable ventures, Hashdex Group played a pivotal role in co-creating the Nasdaq Crypto Index (NCI), aimed at furnishing global investors with a dependable benchmark for the ever-evolving crypto asset class. In a landmark move in 2021, the group introduced the Hashdex Nasdaq Crypto Index ETF (HNCI), marking the inception of the world’s premier crypto index ETF.





Managing the fund assets for the Bitcoin Futures ETF is Tidal Investments LLC, an entity entrusted with the responsibility of navigating the intricate landscape of crypto investments. With a steadfast dedication to bridging the gap between traditional finance and the crypto space, Hashdex continues to spearhead initiatives that pave the way for the mainstream adoption of digital assets.



Grayscale



Founded in 2013, Grayscale made its mark by launching a Bitcoin trust in the same year, marking its entry into the digital currency investment realm. In 2015, the company became a subsidiary of Digital Currency Group, consolidating its position in the market. 



Notably, Grayscale Bitcoin Trust made history in 2015 by becoming the first publicly traded Bitcoin fund in the United States, trading over-the-counter on the OTCQX market. However, Grayscale’s fee structure, although higher than average compared to similar exchange-traded funds (ETFs), was justified by the company as necessary to cover the costs of trading Bitcoin.





Despite its pioneering efforts, Grayscale faced setbacks in its ambition to transition its Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) into an ETF. The company’s application in 2017 was met with negative feedback from the SEC, leading to a voluntary withdrawal. Nonetheless, perseverance paid off as Grayscale successfully completed the transformation after seven years.



Now, with its focus on Ethereum, Grayscale aims to capitalize on the growing interest in the cryptocurrency market. By pivoting towards spot ETFs for its Ethereum trust, Grayscale seeks to offer investors diversified opportunities to engage with digital assets in a regulated framework.



Franklin Templeton



Franklin Templeton, a stalwart in traditional finance circles, has taken a significant stride into the world of cryptocurrency, signaling a profound shift in the industry’s landscape. With a rich history spanning 77 years, the company boasts a staggering $1.5 trillion in assets under management, solidifying its position as a heavyweight in the asset management sector.



This embrace of crypto represents a departure from the traditional for Franklin Templeton, earning it the moniker of being “TradFi” incarnate. Earlier this year, the company made waves by launching the Franklin Bitcoin ETF (EZBC), joining the ranks of just ten spot Bitcoin ETFs presently listed in the United States.





In a bold display of its commitment to the crypto movement, Franklin Templeton adorned its iconic Ben Franklin logo with laser eyes, a symbol widely associated with fervent support for Bitcoin and the broader cryptocurrency ecosystem.



Franklin Templeton has also set its sights on expanding its ETF portfolio to include Ether. Alongside several other firms, Franklin Templeton has submitted spot Ethereum ETF proposals to the SEC, signaling its intent to capitalize on the growing demand for exposure to digital assets beyond Bitcoin.



Challenges of Ethereum ETF Applications



Industry experts express doubts regarding the likelihood of approvals arriving in May, as initially scheduled, for various reasons. Foremost among these concerns is the current state of Ether, the native cryptocurrency of the Ethereum blockchain, which is undergoing a process called staking. Staking involves cryptocurrency holders locking up their funds as collateral to support the network’s operations, in return for rewards in the form of additional cryptocurrency.



The potential classification of Ether as a security by the SEC) looms large, with significant implications not only for the token itself but also for the broader cryptocurrency markets. Should the SEC deem Ether security, it would necessitate compliance with securities laws, granting the SEC enhanced authority to regulate its trading and usage. Additionally, such a classification could pave the way for other cryptocurrencies to be labeled as securities, subjecting them to heightened regulatory scrutiny.



The prolonged delays in the SEC’s evaluation process have led industry experts to question the agency’s motives, drawing parallels with its historical approach in rejecting numerous Bitcoin (BTC) applications over the past decade. Consequently, the initial optimism surrounding Ethereum ETF applications has waned in recent weeks despite earlier forecasts predicting the approval of all filings by May 2024.



In light of the latest postponements by the SEC, analysts are now speculating that the regulatory body intends to reject all spot Ethereum ETF applications slated for review in May. This development marks a shift in sentiment within the industry, prompting stakeholders to reassess their expectations regarding the approval of Ethereum-based investment products.



Could There Be A Bright Future For Ethereum ETF Applications?



The SEC, notorious for its numerous delays in greenlighting spot Bitcoin ETFs, finds itself in a comparable predicament with spot Ethereum ETFs. Presently, the regulatory body is tasked with evaluating eight Ethereum ETF applications, each with distinct deadlines, awaiting their verdict.



The SEC’s current deadline to either approve or deny these spot Ethereum ETFs is set for the conclusion of May 2024. However, the SEC has extended its deadline for making a decision on the spot Ethereum ETF applications put forth by BlackRock and Fidelity. This extension stems partly from the SEC’s request for public input regarding the Fidelity and BlackRock ETF applications. Specifically, the SEC is soliciting public commentary on whether the proposed spot Ethereum ETFs might introduce vulnerabilities to market manipulation.



Ethereum ETF Applications: Is There Potential For New Breakthrough? 24



During the approval process for spot Bitcoin ETFs, certain applicants took the initiative to submit revised documents to the SEC, aiming to integrate insights gleaned from the public comment period. Eventually, the SEC granted approval to those applications. Should spot Ethereum ETF applicants follow suit and update their submissions to assimilate feedback, it could signal a positive indication that the SEC might incline towards approving their applications.



Conclusion



Recent developments have fueled speculation and skepticism alike. Many wonder whether the SEC will follow its precedent set with Bitcoin and approve Ethereum ETFs, or if a different stance will emerge. The approval of the Bitcoin ETF served as a significant milestone, marking the first time a cryptocurrency-based ETF gained regulatory approval in the United States. However, Ethereum’s case presents its own unique set of considerations.



The SEC’s decision regarding spot Ethereum ETFs carries profound implications for the broader market. Approval could signal growing acceptance and integration of cryptocurrencies within traditional financial systems. Conversely, a denial might dampen enthusiasm and prompt a reevaluation of the regulatory hurdles facing crypto-based financial products.

Why Is The Crypto Market Up Today?


The total market cap (TOTAL) along with Bitcoin (BTC) price observed recovery in the last 24 hours after the bearish few days. At the same time, Toncoin’s (TON) price also shot up by 16%, invalidating a crucial resistance. 
In the news today:-

Deutsche Bank Raised Concerns About Tether’s USDT, highlighting stability concerns. These concerns were in reference to Tether’s past regulatory issues.
Ripple, along with Hedera and Algorand, has become a founding member of the DerRec Alliance, which aims to simplify the process of securing and recovering digital assets and other secrets.

Total Market Cap Recovers
The total value of all cryptocurrencies was vulnerable to a decline below the support of $2.2 trillion. However, changing winds across the market resulted in a TOTAL recovery of 2.85%, adding more than $114 billion in a day.
At present, the total market capitalization is at $2.26 trillion, exhibiting the potential to flip $2.3 trillion and $2.4 trillion in resistance into support over the month.

However, since $2.3 trillion has acted as a strong resistance in the past, TOTAL could potentially witness a failed breach. This would keep the total market cap within the sub $2.2 trillion range.
Bitcoin Inches Close to $63,000
Bitcoin’s price witnessed considerable growth in a single day, which was rather necessary after the cryptocurrency nearly fell below $61,000. At the time of writing, BTC is trading at $62,880, nearing the resistance at $63,720.
Flipping it into support would also enable a breakout from the bullish flag pattern and result in a rise to $65,000 and beyond.

However, if the breach fails, Bitcoin would remain stuck in the flag, potentially falling back to $61,000 or below.
Toncoin Posts a Green Candle
Toncoin’s price action was on the rise with the broader market cues as the altcoin marked a 16.61% growth in the span of 24 hours. In doing so, TON also breached through the crucial resistance marked at $6.5 to trade at $6.7 at the moment.

If the rally continues, Toncoin would be able to flip the resistance at $7 into support, provided it cements $6.5 as a support floor.

But if these conditions fail and TON falls below $6.5 again, the altcoin could note a drawdown to $6. This would result in the invalidation of the bullish thesis.

FTX Creditors Reject Amended Compensation Plan Citing Controversial Exculpatory Clause and Undervalued Bitcoin Payments



                    

FTX’s recent amended proposal, which includes an exculpatory clause, has met with significant backlash from its creditors. 



Released on May 7, the proposal is aimed at compensating the creditors, including a noteworthy figure of “billions in compensation.” However, the inclusion of an exculpatory clause has become a major point of contention.




This specific clause would absolve Sullivan & Cromwell (S&C), the law firm managing FTX’s bankruptcy, from any liability for damages incurred during the bankruptcy process. 



S&C’s involvement in the company’s affairs, as it had previously served as outside counsel in various transactions, further complicates perceptions.



Sunil, a prominent FTX creditor and member of the FTX Customer Ad-Hoc Committee, which represents over 1,500 creditors, strongly criticized the clause. 




He highlighted that the clause would prevent S&C from being held accountable for potential misdeeds including “selling FTX assets at 70% to 90% discounts to their own clients and insiders.” 



On May 8, Sunil expressed his discontent on X, stating:



“S&C included an exculpation clause so they can not be held liable for misconduct — selling FTX assets at 70% to 90% discounts to their own clients and insiders (Ledger X, Galaxy), not restarting FTX 2.0, etc if we accept the plan.”



This controversy follows a lawsuit filed three months prior by top FTX creditors against S&C. 




The lawsuit accused the firm of actively participating in FTX’s “multibillion-dollar fraud” and profiting from these misdeeds. A February 16 court document illuminated the allegations:



“S&C knew of FTX US and FTX Trading Ltd.’s omissions, untruthful and fraudulent conduct, and misappropriation of Class Members’ funds. 



READ MORE: Coinbase Faces Class-Action Lawsuit Over Alleged Securities Deception



“Despite this knowledge, S&C stood to gain financially from the FTX Group’s misconduct and so agreed, at least impliedly, to assist that unlawful conduct for its own gain.”



The financial ties are further underlined by the fact that FTX owed S&C up to $1.45 billion in legal bankruptcy fees, a figure confirmed by compensation filings from December 2023.



The response from FTX’s creditors has been overwhelmingly negative, especially concerning the proposal’s payment plan. 



While FTX debtors have suggested a compensation formula based on a depreciated Bitcoin valuation of $16,800, critics argue this is grossly unfair given Bitcoin’s price increase since FTX’s collapse. 



BitGo CEO Mike Belshe commented on the matter in a May 8 X post:



“0% of FTX creditors agree that receiving $16800 for your bitcoin is fully compensated. I understand why the bankruptcy process needs to work this way but let’s not pretend victims are getting their money back or that FTX wasn’t as awful as it was.”



Given these circumstances, there’s a significant possibility that the amended plan will be rejected by the creditors, as further indicated by Rob, Paradex’s head of growth and a pseudonymous FTX creditor, who voiced his decision to reject the plan on May 8:



“Icing on the cake from the team that destroyed billions of potential value for FTX customers. This can’t be allowed. I’m voting NO on this plan.”

Bitcoin Miners Subsidy Surged With Ordinals And Runes


                                Applications To Solve Bitcoin Miners Subsidy Problems                                IntroductionSatoshi Nakamoto is a mysterious creator of Bitcoin who started the blockchain and stated that miners would make money through transaction fees one day. He also envisioned that miners would keep making money as and when these programs get better and more popular, and keep strengthening Bitcoin Mining.Challenges Faced by Bitcoin MinersIn the Cryptocurrency market after every halving event, Bitcoin miners face problems because they always get fewer rewards. This could be bad news for miners dependent on Bitcoin transaction fees. In January 2023,  before applications like the Ordinals protocol launched, miners depended on transaction fees to earn extra money. With every halving, it was difficult for the miners to earn a subsidy as it halves 210000 blocks which blocks the miners' revenue and makes them earn hardly.Role of Ordinals, Runes, and BRC-20The applications like Ordinals, Runes, and BRC-20s could help miners to stick towards the events like halving. According to big cryptocurrency mining groups, these programs could change things for miners and let them earn Bitcoin Transaction Fees. However, the mining revenue can be increased with an increase in Bitcoin (BTC) prices. As the applications layer comes into the line, further developments can be done so which creates new and improved software and encourages more people to use Bitcoin for different purposes. This could expand the overall activity on the network. In short, increased network activity leads to more transactions and more transactions automatically generate more fees for miners. Even if Block subsidy decreases miners could maintain stability in income due to diversification of income.After 20th April 2024, a later Bitcoin halving event occurred, Miners got a big boost as  840,000 blocks were mined worth $2.4 million with transaction fees recorded at 37.6 BTC transaction fee. This also shows that programs like halving can help the miners.Fluctuations in Miners Rewards and Unexpected RewardsThe reward of the 40.7 BTC is divided into two parts block subsidy and transaction fees. The Block subsidy is a fixed reward received by miners after successfully mining a new block where the new subsidy was 3.125 BTC, which is the amount awarded to miners for each new block mined after a halving event. The Block subsidy came from Memecoin and Non-Fungible Tokens. Memecoin competing to "inscribe rare satoshis" and fungible tokens using a new token standard called Runes.Transaction fees on the Bitcoin network surpass certain milestones such as 30, 40, or even 50 BTC. However, they were surprised to receive such a substantial reward during the halving block. Bitcoin miners earned $78.3 million in revenue, collectively where transaction fees cover a large portion. The fees earned by Bitcoin miners exceeded those earned by Ethereum stalkers and Uniswap liquidity providers on nine out of the last 20 days since the halving occurred. As the Bitcoin network continues to evolve and attract more users, the demand for transactions and the associated fees are expected to rise. There are fluctuations in miner revenue due to popularity of protocols like ordinals, Runes, and BRC-20 after the launch. These fluctuations introduced a kind of instability in miners' earnings. In 2016, big cryptocurrency mining groups gathered 3 halving events Ordinals, Runes, and BRC-20s with block 840000 marked the 37534th block mined in 2900 days.  Miners from 118 countries help them out, showing how Bitcoin mining is a global effort and highlighting mining groups' role as significant players in the industry.Also Read: Bitcoin Recorded One Billion Transactions On Bitcoin Network

We asked ChatGPT what will be SHIB price in 2025; Here’s what it said


Like many other assets in the cryptocurrency sector, Shiba Inu (SHIB) has been recording advances recently, adding up to its particularly successful year that saw it soar over 125%, and data compiled by the artificial intelligence (AI) platform ChatGPT suggests a wide trading range in the next year.
Indeed, Finbold asked ChatGPT-4, the most recent model of the OpenAI brainchild, to provide insights into the possible price range of Shiba Inu in 2025, taking into account expert opinions, historical price movements, indicators, and other relevant information from the viewpoint on May 10.
Shiba Inu price prediction
So, will Shiba Inu coin reach $1 any time soon? Not very likely, at least according to the information that ChatGPT has gathered from the internet’s most prominent crypto monitoring and forecasting websites. Nonetheless, a price increase is quite possible.


As it happens, the advanced generative AI tool has cited several such platforms, including CoinCodex, which has set a minimum price of SHIB to $0.000041 in 2025, “indicating a potential growth considering its current rate,” as ChatGPT further elaborated.
On top of that, it shared an even more bullish prognosis by WalletInvestor, which sees Shiba Inu on a “growth trajectory leading to $0.000061 in 2025, which suggests an upside potential or around 160% from its current price,” the AI chatbot observed.
Finally, it also provided a slightly less impressive, though still optimistic, forecast by Digital Coin Price, which has set the price of SHIB at $0.000029 by 2025, “demonstrating a 124% increase,” from its price at press time, as OpenAI’s celebrated product stated.
Furthermore, the bot offered a perspective that takes into account Shiba Inu’s all-time high (ATH) of $0.000039, which the popular dog meme token reached in October 2021 and hasn’t yet managed to surpass, even though many other assets in the crypto market have:

“SHIB saw an astronomical rise in 2021 but has experienced volatility typical of most cryptocurrencies. It’s important to consider that its historical peak was $0.000039, suggesting room for growth if market conditions are favorable.”

SHIB price analysis
For now, SHIB is trading at $0.00002335, marking a 3.56% increase on the day and adding up to the 1.51% advance across the past week, as the asset moves to recover from the 15.48% loss on its monthly chart while gaining 126.28% since the year’s turn.

Meanwhile, crypto expert and industry influencer Del Crxpto has recently declared that he knew inside Shiba Inu information that has led him to stock up on more SHIB, possibly referring to the fact that whatever major reveal was supposedly coming would trigger a SHIB rally.

All things considered, making specific SHIB price predictions is a challenging task, although insights provided by AI can help sort out and gauge the direction in which the crypto asset could move in the future. However, doing one’s own research and keeping up with any Shiba Inu news is essential.

Metaplanet Inc, a Japanese publicly traded firm that hopes to recreate the legacies of MicroStrategy in Asia, has acquired another tranche of Bitcoin (BTC). In an announcement shared on X, the firm has acquired a new tranche of 18.8698 BTC.The purchase was made on April 23, and it is valued at an aggregate amount of 200 million yen ($1.2 million). With this acquisition, the firm’s total Bitcoin holdings now come in at 117.7217 Bitcoin worth 10,193,536 yen per BTC. This Bitcoin bag is worth 1.2 billion yen, or $7,708,020. When Metaplanet started acquiring Bitcoin back in April, it triggered positive sentiment in Asia’s investment landscape. This sentiment was ignited in the United States back in August 2020, when MicroStrategy made its first Bitcoin purchase. Today, MicroStrategy is the second-largest corporate holder of Bitcoin after BlackRock Inc.Under the leadership of its Chairman Michael Saylor, MicroStrategy stacks Bitcoin regularly. Its last buy-up came in March when it acquired 12,000 BTC for $821.7 million. At the moment, the firm now holds a total of 214,246 tokens valued at around $14 billion. As U.Today reported earlier, MicroStrategy’s unrealized gain on its Bitcoin bet now comes in at $6.2 billion.MicroStrategy’s aggressive approach involves selling Convertible Senior Notes with the proceeds injected into the asset. Thus far, the move has paid off, and it remains unclear how long Metaplanet plans to sustain its strategy.Since Metaplanet joined the Bitcoin bandwagon, the price of BTC has generally slumped amid erratic sell-offs. However, with new mainstream firms reporting Bitcoin bets, bullish optimism has largely returned to the market. At the time of writing, the coin is seeing a mild recovery, up 3.14% in 24 hours to $62,907.50. With Metaplanet borrowing MicroStrategy’s playbook, it is likely to record similar bullish returns in the long term.

Controversial Ohio Commencement Speech Sparks Crypto Debate


							

Public reaction at Ohio State highlights the gap between crypto enthusiasts and broader understanding.



Effective communication is critical for bridging the gap between cryptocurrency fans and skeptics.



Stagnation in the crypto business requires fresh narratives and innovations to propel development.




As per Bloomberg report, the commencement speech at THE Ohio State University took a controversial twist as crypto entrepreneur Chris Pan’s remarks on Bitcoin were met with boos and jeers from the graduating class of 2024. 



Pan, who considers himself as a social entrepreneur, tried to explain the advantages of Bitcoin saying that it is an under-appreciated asset class because of the decentralized and finite nature. He highlighted current events, like the launches of Bitcoin ETFs by BlackRock and Fidelity, as the actual proof of cryptocurrency’s current mainstream acceptance and viability.



However, Pan’s speech backfired, highlighting a glaring disconnect between the crypto community and the broader public. While crypto enthusiasts often tout Bitcoin’s popularity among digital-native Gen Z, the negative reaction at the graduation ceremony suggests otherwise. This incident underscores the challenges crypto faces in gaining widespread acceptance and understanding.



Pan later clarified that his intention was not to promote Bitcoin, claiming he had only started learning about the cryptocurrency three months prior. He expressed regret for not emphasizing this point in his speech to make it more relatable to the audience. Despite the backlash, some argue that any publicity, even negative, could benefit the crypto industry, especially as it faces a lull in momentum.









Moreover, Pan emphasized that while some may assume he’s been immersed in the field for a decade, his actual entry coincided with the introduction of ETFs. Pan admitted he should have clarified this point to foster better understanding among the audience. He acknowledged that mentioning “Bitcoin” triggered a negative response, causing the subsequent points he made to fall flat. This experience, he noted, served as a valuable lesson for him. 



The cryptocurrency sector, which was previously fueled by many storylines and breakthroughs, is currently experiencing a period of stagnation. Projects that previously brought in billions of dollars are now suffering, and the industry is wondering where the next wave of users will come from. With prior storylines fading, the future of cryptocurrency remains unknown.

Jack Dorsey Issues Most Bullish BTC Forecast Yet, Says Price May Hit $1M By 2030



Dorsey’s bullish outlook for the long-term price action of Bitcoin borders on the collaborative nature of its ecosystem.

Twitter co-founder Jack Dorsey has issued a rather reaching Bitcoin (BTC) price prediction after claiming that the asset’s value should hit $1 million by the year 2030. He shared this in a Thursday interview with Pirate Wires’ Mike Solana, adding that there is every possibility that the price will grow even further from that point onward.
Dorsey’s bullish outlook for the long-term price action of Bitcoin borders on the collaborative nature of its ecosystem. According to him, even that is more interesting about Bitcoin than its price or its rich history. The head of the financial services firm Block explained how the ecosystem functions in a way that rewards collaboration, to ultimately improve the network for everyone involved. About Bitcoin and its ecosystem,  Dorsey said partly:




“…Anyone who works on it, or gets paid in it, or buys it for themselves, everyone who puts any effort in to make it better, is making the entire ecosystem better, which makes the price go up.”
Jack Dorsey’s BTC Prediction
Interestingly, Dorsey is now one of the very few people who have made such elaborate predictions about the coveted crypto asset. Ark Invest’s Cathie Wood has issued similar predictions in the past about Bitcoin hitting the $1 million mark by 2030. However, she got even more bullish in March, during an interview on the New Zealand Herald’s Markets with Madison online video show. In that interview, Wood said for the first time that a million-dollar-plus Bitcoin could happen before her past estimate of 2030.
It also appears that Dorsey’s views are borne out of personal conviction and not just for public records. Earlier this month, he shared, in a note to shareholders, that his fintech firm Block will pump 10% of its gross profit from Bitcoin-related products back into buying more BTC every month.
For Dorsey, $1 million is the least price achievable for BTC by 2030, and from there, it can only go upwards.
Departure from BlueSky
On May 6, reports filtered through that Dorsey was leaving the board of Bluesky, the decentralized social network he co-founded as an alternative to Twitter in 2019. However, he has now touched on the topic in this same interview, sharing what was the reason for his decision.
Dorsey claims that BlueSky was “literally repeating all the mistakes [Twitter] made”. In his opinion, the idea of true decentralization is lost in the protocol. Hence, it is just another app.

Coinbase to Take the Reins as BlockFi Announces Shutdown


On May 9, BlockFi, which was a popular crypto lending platform, announced the closure of its web platform. It is partnering with Coinbase, a US-based crypto exchange, to manage and distribute assets. However, BlockFi has not yet announced a specific shutdown date.
This move is a significant pivot for BlockFi. It has been navigating a complex financial situation since its late 2023 Chapter 11 bankruptcy filing.
What’s Next for BlockFi Customers?
According to the official statement, BlockFi will email clients detailed instructions on creating a Coinbase account. This will facilitate the transition. Clients who didn’t withdraw their digital assets by April 28, 2024, at 23:59 UTC and didn’t complete identity verification by May 10, 2024, at 23.59 UTC, will find their assets available in kind at Coinbase.

“For BlockFi clients who are unable to open a Coinbase account, all distributions will be made in cash, pursuant to the provisions of the Plan that require cash distributions where crypto distributions are not feasible,” BlockFi added.

BlockFi also encourages all clients to download their transaction history and other relevant documents.

Furthermore, the Plan Administrator can now choose Coinbase for future distributions. This includes any funds recovered from FTX.

BlockFi’s web platform shutdown announcement follows FTX revealing its updated repayment plan. The plan includes BlockFi as a “key stakeholder.”
FTX’s repayment to BlockFi will be based on the previously approved settlement. BlockFi reached a principal settlement with FTX and Alameda Research in March this year.
Under the settlement terms, FTX has pledged to prioritize a $250 million payment to BlockFi. This initial amount is part of a larger $874 million settlement. The settlement aims to compensate BlockFi for assets held on the FTX exchange and loans to Alameda Research.
This settlement stems from a close relationship between BlockFi and FTX. After the FTX fiasco in November 2022, BlockFi suspended withdrawals for its customer’s funds.

Exodus CEO frustrated as SEC delays listing amid celebrations

Exodus Movement, Inc. (Exodus) is facing a delay in its NYSE (New York Stock Exchange) American listing pending completion of the SEC’s review of its registration statement — which went into effect on April 28.The NYSE American previously approved the listing of Exodus’ shares of Class A common stock at a par value of $0.000001, expected to begin trading on May 9. However, due to the backpedal, Exodus’ transition from the OTCQX to the NYSE American will be put on hold until the SEC completes its regulatory compliance process.Source: https://twitter.com/exodus_io/status/1788403755160944799The delay in listing carries heavy implications for Exodus as the move to NYSE American would affect its visibility and potential financial market growth. This regulatory hurdle demonstrates a bottleneck crypto companies face when pursuing traditional finance (TradFi) regulated ventures. Exodus CEO, JP Richardson, expressed his surprise and confusion at the delay, stating:“We remain hopeful that the SEC will follow through on its commitment to treat us as the law intends. Exodus has been fully transparent and responsive throughout this process and we expect a swift resolution in this matter. In the meantime, we will continue to provide the best possible service and value for our customers and shareholders.” Richardson later explained that numerous employees and their families had gathered in New York City “to celebrate the moment.” “Every step of the way we’ve played by the regulatory rules given, and then at the 11th hour, the rules of the game were changed. It’s beyond frustrating” he said.Source: https://twitter.com/jprichardson/status/1788655686789824901Exodus explained that it may reconsider the decision to list again post-SEC review, depending upon the outcome, and that stockholders do not need to take any action at this time.Entrepreneur and crypto personality Lark Davis commented on the situation, stating that the SEC are “probably about to sue.” Source: https://twitter.com/TheCryptoLark/status/1788494152537358755Though potentially satirical in nature, Davis’ comment does highlight concerns within the crypto community — heightened by the recent United States House of Representatives vote to nullify the SEC’s anti-crypto banking guidance, SAB 121. The bipartisan bill, dubbed H.J.Res.109, was put to the House by Republican Party Representative Mike Flood and passed on May 8. Passing 228 to 182 votes, Flood described the SAB 121 as unfair on banks seeking crypto custody, due to custodial assets always being considered “off-balance sheet.”These legislative endeavours reflect upon the tension growing between financial institutions and regulatory entities as the crypto market progressively attempts to enter TradFi.

How to securely store crypto in software wallets

Software wallets enable crypto users to access digital assets at any time and from any location. However, the same connectivity also makes these wallets vulnerable to hacks and thefts. The security of software wallets is dependent on the user’s compliance with advised digital safety procedures and the wallet’s built-in security measures.Digital assets such as cryptocurrencies and nonfungible tokens (NFTs) face a plethora of security issues, such as malware designed to steal money and phishing schemes that try to obtain critical data. One needs to cultivate an adequate understanding of security standards to use software wallets safely.This article describes what software wallets are and how to choose the right software wallet. It discusses the process of installing a software wallet and how to manage it securely.Choosing the right software walletOne needs to be aware of the software wallets available and how they function to make an informed decision.Software wallets use private and public keys to facilitate the transmission, storage and management of digital assets. Public keys enable users to receive cryptocurrencies as wallet addresses, whereas private keys authorize transactions. While hardware wallets store funds physically, software wallets offer a digital interface to digital assets stored on the blockchain. Software wallets are broadly categorized into three types: desktop, mobile and web wallets. Desktop walletsA desktop wallet — e.g., Exodus — is basically an application that enables the user to securely store and manage private keys on a computer. If one sends or receives crypto payments frequently, a desktop wallet is a convenient option. Users connect desktop wallets to the internet when they need to make a transaction. They are usually noncustodial, which means that although the funds are fully in the control of the user, the onus to keep private keys secure is also on them.Mobile walletsA mobile wallet — e.g., Trust Wallet — is an application designed to be installed on a smartphone to access and operate digital assets. Such a wallet is convenient for on-the-go use and supports QR code scanning. Mobile wallets developed by a crypto exchange have the additional functionality of integration with the exchange.Web walletsWeb wallets — e.g., MetaMask — which are accessible via browsers, store private keys on a server. These wallets allow one to access their funds on the go, which makes them very convenient; however, there is an inherent security risk, as the keys are always online and the control is with a third party (a crypto exchange or enterprise). One needs to get a software wallet that facilitates ease of transactions while also adequately protecting their crypto holdings. The characteristics of various kinds of wallets need to be taken into account when choosing a crypto wallet.What to consider when selecting a software walletOne needs to factor in several aspects when choosing a software wallet:Security featuresTo deal with threat vectors, one needs to consider security features such as support for multiple signatures and two-factor authentication (2FA). As bad actors keep coming up with innovative ways to breach the security layer, the software wallet should get regular security upgrades.Supported cryptocurrenciesExplore the cryptocurrencies that the software wallet will accept. To avoid getting a new wallet every time to trade or store a currency, it is better to opt for a wallet that is compatible with a large number of digital assets.User interface (UI)Wallets with an easy-to-use UI enhance the user experience. Regardless of one’s level of skill, such wallets make managing digital assets simple.Setting up a software walletOne needs to set up the software wallet before they begin working with it. Here is the process of setting up a software wallet:Use the right sourceUsers need to make sure they download the official wallet from its official website, the App Store or the Google Play Store; otherwise, they could become vulnerable to phishing scams. They should double-check the website’s URL to confirm its legitimacy.Follow the installation instructions Whether it is a desktop, mobile or web application, the process should be straightforward. The user needs to give the necessary permissions when prompted, ensuring their device aligns with the wallet’s functionality. How to enhance software wallet securityTo ensure the secure storage of cryptocurrencies in software wallets, adopting advanced security practices is paramount: Store the seed phrase securelyWhen setting up the software wallet, the user needs to generate their seed phrase, which they could later need to access their crypto assets. It is a series of words that act as a master key to accessing funds. It is important for the user to keep it confidential, as anyone with access to the seed phrase will have access to funds. In the event one loses the seed phrase, the funds are irretrievable (if they also cannot remember their login password). In case the user loses access to the device or something breaks, they can restore access using the seed phrase. Use of password managersKeeping strong passwords for all financial applications is important. However, it creates another problem, as most find it hard to remember the different passwords they use on various websites. Password managers simplify the process of using and managing strong passwords. These applications keep wallet passwords in an encrypted vault that is secured with a master password.Password managers usually come with strong password generation features, which strengthen security by creating unique and difficult passwords. Moreover, the encryption implemented by these managers makes it exceedingly unlikely for unauthorized individuals to access stored data without the master password, which augments the protection.Two-factor authentication (2FA)Two-factor authentication (2FA) adds an additional security layer that goes beyond conventional login and password systems. Once users activate 2FA on software wallets, they might have to enter two different codes received via two different modes of communication in order to be verified. For instance, they might receive one code via email and another via smartphone. The application will grant access to the user only when they have entered the password and the two codes correctly. Even in the case that an attacker obtains the password, they are unlikely to get access to the email and the mobile device at the same time. The dual-verification system strengthens security against unauthorized access attempts. Multisignature walletsWallets with multiple signatures employ a cooperative security mechanism that requires consent from designated individuals prior to executing a transaction. This approach provides robust security to protect funds from abuse or unapproved access. Requiring independent approval from a predefined number of participants for each transaction provides a strong barrier against unauthorized activity.This method works well for any group that manages shared cryptocurrency holdings since it segregates the duty of safeguarding the wallet’s contents and improves security. By virtue of their joint authorization, multisignature wallets reduce the possibility of single points of failure.Biometric authenticationBiometrics in crypto wallets introduces an additional layer of security, ensuring that getting access to funds simply becomes improbable without the physical presence of the user. The mechanism leverages physical characteristics such as fingerprints, face IDs or iris scans to authenticate users. Integration of biometric authentication in crypto wallets effectively mitigates the vulnerabilities associated with password-based systems. The user experience becomes more convenient, as they can securely access their funds with a simple scan or touch. Update softwareThe user needs to keep their wallet software updated. Developers frequently release updates to patch vulnerabilities, add features, and improve security. A crypto wallet that isn’t regularly updated is more likely to fall prey to hackers’ tactics.Verify the authenticity of websitesThe user needs to be cognizant of phishing attempts and malicious websites that aim to steal information from their device. They need to verify the authenticity of the websites they browse before entering any sensitive information regarding their crypto wallet.Avoid public WiFiWhen accessing a wallet or conducting transactions, one needs to use a secure and private internet connection. Public WiFi networks are often unsecured, making them hotspots for attackers looking to intercept data. Find the balance between security and convenienceSettling somewhere between security and convenience is important when it comes to software wallets.One needs to select a reliable software wallet, protect recovery phrases, and be on top of potential security threats. Ticking all these checkpoints will ensure the security of one’s digital assets.

X launches AI-curated audiences for advertisers

The business account for social media platform X announced a new feature for advertisers enhanced by artificial intelligence (AI). On May 10, the platform said its “AI Audience” feature will be coming soon. This feature will allow advertisers to briefly describe their target audience for the given ad, then allow X’s AI systems to generate a pool of “the most relevant X users” to that target in a matter of seconds.  


It gave the example of a user inputting the target audience as “Technology Leaders” with the description “users who are leaders in technology.” In seconds, the AI generated a list with hundreds of users in the target audience, along with statistics for the demographic. The post was reposted by X owner Elon Musk, though without any additional comment on the development. Meanwhile, in response to the initial post, one user commented that this would be a “gamer changer” for the world of advertising and “value for your money” on the platform. He questioned, however, how good the AI is at targeting accurate audiences. If the AI proves efficient over time at correctly identifying target audiences, this move could put X ahead of other platforms when it comes to advertising, as other platforms would still require research for targeting correct audiences. However, other users were concerned about the AI reinforcing and perpetuating biases and stereotypes. Source: Crypto SignalsAnother user questioned what exactly X is selling and “to whom.” The user said, “I thought I am the one paying so X doesn’t have to pimp me to brands and sell me to corporations.” Despite some skepticism, many users called the development “exciting” and “really smart.” Related: Elaborate Elon Musk deepfake crypto fraud uncovered in Hong KongThis development comes amid Musk’s proactive stance on integrating AI into the social media platform. On March 26, Musk announced that X’s own AI model, Grok, would be accessible to all premium X subscribers. On March 29, the next version of the model, Grok-1.5, was announced. It is said to have “improved reasoning capabilities” and a context length of 128,000 tokens.Amid a lawsuit between Musk and OpenAI, with which he formerly had ties, on March 11, the X owner said that he would be making Grok open-source.Although Musk’s AI company xAI has been actively developing new tools for mass use, in January, Musk denied the accuracy of a report that claimed xAI had secured $500 million of its $1 billion investment goal.Magazine: How to stop the artificial intelligence apocalypse: David Brin, Uplift author

Kraken counters SEC’s legal interpretation in dismissal motion

In its legal defense against a lawsuit from the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), Kraken has filed a reply refuting the agency's allegations of trading unregistered securities, arguing that the case lacks precision and misinterprets fundamental legal concepts.In its response filing, Kraken identifies discrepancies in the SEC’s argument, noting the agency’s failure to accurately identify investment contracts traded on the exchange. Additionally, Kraken argues that the SEC’s use of terms like “investment concept” and “ecosystem” instead of “investment contract” and “enterprise” reflects a misunderstanding of the case’s legal framework.The SEC initially sued Kraken in November 2023, alleging it unlawfully made millions of dollars from “crypto asset securities” transactions and provided “exchange, broker, dealer, and clearing agency” services without having registered with the agency “as required by law.” This was months after settling charges over Kraken’s former staking service.Kraken’s reply to the SEC in support of the motion to dismiss. Source: CourtListenerHowever, Kraken filed a motion to dismiss, contending that it establishes a “dangerous precedent” for the agency’s jurisdiction. In response, the SEC filed a 39-page opposition to Kraken’s motion to dismiss, saying, “It is simply not the case that this enforcement action exceeds the authority Congress granted the SEC.”In the Thursday, May 9 motion, Kraken contests the SEC’s claim that written contracts are required in investment agreements, emphasizing that contracts can be oral, expressed or implied. Kraken argues that the SEC’s efforts to refute unaddressed arguments indicate a misunderstanding of the case’s central points.Related: SEC has taken ‘too expansive’ a view of crypto, says former commissionerKraken references past SEC cases involving initial coin offerings to support its stance. The exchange emphasized that these cases centered on contractual rights and obligations, supporting Kraken’s view of investment contracts. Kraken’s motion hinges on interpreting the SEC’s jurisdiction using the Howey test, which defines a security based on specific criteria, such as the investment of capital in a common enterprise with the expectation of profit, driven by the efforts of others.The U.S. Congress is currently deliberating on crypto regulation with several ongoing bills. Concurrently, eight state attorneys general in the U.S. have filed a joint amicus brief, contending that the SEC exceeded its delegated authority in the lawsuit against the cryptocurrency exchange Kraken.Magazine: ‘Crypto is inevitable’ so we went ‘all in’ — Meet Vance Spencer, permabull

Top Bitcoin (BTC) Predictions: Renewed Bull Run or a Plunge Below $55K?


																TL;DR

Bitcoin has rebounded past $63,000 with predictions suggesting it might reach near $110,000 by the end of the year, influenced by factors like the recent halving which typically precede major rallies.
While some analysts expect potential drops, prominent figures project extremely optimistic long-term values for Bitcoin, with forecasts up to $1 million.


BTC’s Next Possible Move?
After trading in the red for a few days, the primary cryptocurrency headed north on May 10, surpassing the $63,000 mark. Many analysts believe the uptick will continue in the following months and lead to unseen peaks.
One person supporting that thesis is the popular X user Titan of Crypto. The trader observed the Fibonacci circles on BTC’s price chart, assuming that the cycle’s top of almost $110,000 may occur by the end of this year. 
“It’s a conservative price prediction. I think it’ll exceed it,” the analyst added.
Captain Faibik and Mikybull Crypto were also bullish. The former claimed that BTC is still in a consolidation phase and a breakout “is just a matter of time.” The trader predicted that the next green wave will push the asset’s value to $78,000.
Mikybull Crypto suggested that Bitcoin is in “final preparation for a post-halving massive rally.” Recall that the asset’s latest halving (which slashed the rewards to miners for validating blocks on the blockchain in half) occurred less than a month ago. 




The event has historically resulted in a huge resurgence for the entire cryptocurrency market, with many industry participants expecting the same scenario in the coming months.
It is worth noting that some analysts outlined somewhat bearish predictions. Such is the example of Michael van de Poppe, who believes BTC could drop to the $52,000-$55,000 range should it plunge below the major support zone of $61,000.
The Ultimate Bulls
Other prominent figures, including Robert Kiyosaki, Adam Back, Michael Saylor, and Cathie Wood, have presented much more optimistic BTC price forecasts over the past few years.
Two months ago, the author of the best-seller “Rich Dad, Poor Dad” projected that the asset’s value could soar to $300,000 by the end of 2024. He later changed his prediction to $100,000.
Adam Back, CEO of Blockstream, chipped in six months ago, envisioning a rally to a whopping $700,000 in the near future. He also assumed that BTC’s market cap may surpass that of physical gold. As of the moment, the cryptocurrency’s market cap stands at approximately $1.25 trillion, whereas the yellow metal has almost $16 trillion.
The most bullish predictions came from Michael Saylor (Executive Chairman of MicroStrategy) and Cathie Wood (CEO of Ark Invest). They both see BTC trading at $1 million sometime in the future.

Pair linked to crypto investor kidnapping hand themselves in


A father-son duo handed themselves over to Hong Kong police on Wednesday after their family car was linked to the kidnapping of a crypto investor.  
According to the South China Morning Post, the 55-year-old crypto investor was reportedly taken from her car by four captors and bundled into the back of the car on Tuesday. She was with her husband at the time, but he was reportedly attacked with a stun gun when he tried to intervene. 
A source familiar with the case told the SCMP on Thursday that a 70-year-old businessman and his 30-year-old son were arrested at Tai Po Police Station the next day. They told SCMP that the businessman invested HK$15 million ($1.9 million) in crypto 18 months ago through the kidnapped woman.

According to the source, after investing, the businessman was apparently unable to retrieve his money or contact the woman. 
The source stressed that the arrested father-son duo were not the captors involved with the kidnapping. Police say they are still searching for more suspects.  
The father-son duo were reportedly arrested on suspicion of false imprisonment and assault and were still being questioned on Thursday morning.

Jack Dorsey Predicts Bitcoin Price To Hit At Least $1M By 2030: 'Hits That Number And Goes Beyond' - Benzinga

Jack Dorsey, Former CEO of social media giant Twitter, now X, made a super bullish prediction for Bitcoin BTC/USD, describing it as a fascinating ecosystem and movement. What Happened: Responding to a question posed by journalist Mike Solana on his Pirate Wires site about Bitcoin's price in 2030, Dorsey said he expects the digital asset to hit “at least a million,” and go beyond. The entrepreneur who set up one of the biggest social networks noted that Bitcoin's price isn't the most interesting aspect of the asset, but how it is expanding due to coordinated efforts by different stakeholders. “I don’t know. Over… at least a million. I do think it hits that number and goes beyond.”"The most amazing thing about Bitcoin, apart from the founding story, is anyone who works on it, or gets paid in it, or buys it for themselves — everyone who puts any effort in to make it better — is making the entire ecosystem better, which makes the price go up," Dorsey remarked. Through the course of the conversation, Dorsey made more references to Bitcoin, at one instance praising its decentralized ideals. "It’s like Bitcoin, it doesn't have one leader or one central chokehold element. And I think that’s critical for what it's intended to do."Why It Matters: The world's largest digital asset has jumped 50% since the year began, with optimism buoyed significantly by the introduction of Bitcoin spot ETFs. With easier access to the cryptocurrency market, institutional investors have jumped on the bandwagon, leading to $11.76 billion in cumulative net inflows into these products, according to SoSo Value. The soaring interest has led many influential names to come up with predictions that are, at times, unrealistic. Ark Invest CEO Cathie Wood recently forecasted that one Bitcoin would hit $3.8 million by 2030. Note that Ark Invest operates its own Bitcoin spot ETF, which has attracted $2 billion in net inflows as of this writing. As a result, her estimates may involve a conflict of interest.Price Action: At the time of writing, Bitcoin was trading closer to $63,000, following a 2.73% growth in the last 24 hours, according to data from Benzinga Pro.Read Next: Telegram-Linked Toncoin Price Soars, But So Do Scams As Hackers Steal $140K Worth Of Tokens From Unsuspecting UsersImage Via Shutterstock

Here’s When Bitcoin Could Bottom Out Based on Historical Precedent, According to Analyst Benjamin Cowen - The Daily Hodl


								Widely followed crypto analyst Benjamin Cowen is offering his outlook on when Bitcoin (BTC) could potentially bottom out as the flagship digital asset hovers around $63,000.
In a new video update, Cowen tells the 801,000 subscribers of his YouTube channel that the current Bitcoin price action resembles that which followed the crypto king’s second halving event eight years ago more so than the halving in 2020.










“It looks to me like it’s mimicking 2016 a lot more than the other two cycles, which kind of makes sense. I mean a lot of people who’ve been following Bitcoin for a while have been comparing this cycle more so to the 2016 cycle than the one in 2020.”
Source: Benjamin Cowen/X
According to Cowen, the flagship crypto asset could potentially hit the cycle bottom over the coming weeks based on the Bitcoin Return on Investment (ROI) After Halving metric. The Bitcoin ROI After Halving metric is the ratio of the current price relative to the price of BTC at the time of halving. The latest halving, which cuts miners’ rewards in half every four years, occurred on April 19th.
“If you look at 2016, which might be relevant to compare to, you can see that Bitcoin didn’t durably get back above an ROI of one until about three and a half months after the halving.
And I don’t know if it’s going to play out like that or not, but you can see that that would be more evidence of a summer low. That could potentially be more evidence for a summer low if you look at Bitcoin’s ROI as a measure from the halving and compare it to the 2016 cycle.”

Bitcoin is trading for $62,798 at time of writing, a fractional increase during the last 24 hours.

Metaplanet Increases Bitcoin Holdings, Acquiring Additional 19.87 BTC | Coinspeaker



Metaplanet’s shift to Bitcoin is a significant step for the crypto community; it signals a growing trend of institutional adoption of cryptocurrencies.

Metaplanet, a Japan-based Web3 company, recently announced that it has purchased additional Bitcoin worth ¥200 million, which is equivalent to $1.25 million.
This move by the company follows up on its recent acquisition of the digital asset towards the end of last month. Just a few weeks ago, the Japanese company announced that it had acquired ¥1 Billion worth of BTC, which is about $6.25 million. Although the latest purchase is quite lower than the previous one, it is still a move toward establishing itself as a major force in the digital asset industry.




According to the post on its X page, Metaplanet purchased 19.87 BTC at an average price of 10,065,548 yen per Bitcoin, amounting to 200 million yen. In the released ‘Progress of Disclosure,’ the company stated that its current total BTC holdings are around 117.7 BTC. This investment strategy demonstrates the Japan-based company’s confidence in the coin’s growth and long-term viability and its potential to be widely accepted as a legitimate asset.
Metaplanet announced in early April that it would be embracing BTC as its core treasury asset, which further demonstrates the company’s goal of keeping up with trends and innovation within the finance space. It also positions the company as a leader in the digital finance era and a pioneer in the adoption of virtual assets in Japan. The post stated:
“Our transition to Bitcoin is a significant milestone in our mission to lead in the digital finance era and positions Metaplanet as a pioneer in the adoption of digital assets in Japan. Stay tuned!”
Institutional Investment to Boost Bitcoin Legitimacy and Price
It could be recalled that after the company announced its first acquisition of $6.56 million worth of Bitcoin, an instant effect was seen in its stock price, which surged 90% in just 48 hours. As of now, its price has increased by over 3% in 24 hours, which also reflects the positive impact of the growing influence of cryptocurrencies on the traditional financial market.
Just as Metaplanet’s stock value is increasing, BTC has seen a rise from the slump it experienced earlier, when it dropped to $56,000. With the price still hoping for a major recovery, it currently trades at around $62,000—also a 3% increase in the last 24 hours.
Metaplanet’s shift to Bitcoin is a significant step for the crypto community; it signals a growing trend of institutional adoption of cryptocurrencies. Hence, as more Web3 companies move their assets to the BTC, its legitimacy will be strengthened as a store of value and a hedge over inflation. More so, the influx of large institutions into the crypto sector will also have an impact on the price of this digital asset, which will propel its value to surge more.

Is 'undervalued' ARB's bottom finally in? Metrics say... - AMBCrypto



ARB’s key metric presented a buying opportunity on the charts
Bearish sentiments retained dominance across the market though

The Market Value to Realized Value (MVRV) ratio of leading Layer 2 (L2) token Arbitrum [ARB] has flashed a buy signal on the charts. In fact, AMBCrypto found that the native token’s MVRV ratio assessed over the 30-day and 365-day moving averages returned negative values, at press time.
Source: Santiment
An asset’s MVRV ratio tracks the difference between its current market price and the average price of every coin or token acquired for that asset. 
When its value is positive and above one, the asset is said to be overvalued. This means that the asset’s current market value is significantly higher than the price at which most investors acquire their holdings. Conversely, a negative MVRV value shows that the asset is undervalued. It suggests that the market value of the asset in question is below the average purchase price of all its tokens that are in circulation. 
It is regarded as a perfect time to buy when an asset’s MVRV ratio is negative because, at that point, the asset trades at a discount relative to its historical cost basis.
No price bottom in sight
A good indicator of whether an asset’s price is due for a rally is when a local price bottom has been reached. This is correctly measured by assessing metrics such as an asset’s Age Consumed.
This metric measures the movement of dormant tokens. For its part, ARB’s Age Consumed metric has projected slightly low values since the beginning of May. 
Source: Santiment
Here, it is important this because it offers insight into the shifts in the behavioral patterns of the token’s long-term holders. This group of ARB holders rarely moves their old coins around, and when they do, it often precipitates a shift in market trends. 
When ARB’s Age Consumed metric spikes, it means that many tokens are changing hands after being left idle for an extended period. On the other hand, when it falls, it means that idle coins are left unmoved. 

Realistic or not, here’s ARB’s market cap in BTC’s terms

Since the beginning of May, ARB’s Age Consumed has returned low values – A sign that its long-term holders have barely moved their tokens around. 
This could also indicate that a price bottom is yet to be reached. Ergo, traders should tread with caution, despite the buy signal flashed by ARB’s MVRV ratio.
Additionally, ARB’s price movements observed on the 1-day chart revealed that bearish sentiments remain significant. 
Source: ARB/USDT on TradingView
At press time, ARB’s price rested below its 20-day simple moving average (SMA), confirming the risk of further decline.
When an asset’s price falls below its 20-day SMA, it suggests that the short-term trend for the asset is downward. Traders interpret this as a sign that sellers are in control and that the asset’s price will likely continue declining.
Likewise, the token’s Relative Strength Index (RSI) returned a value of 37.31 – A sign that market participants have been favoring ARB distribution over its accumulation.

Toncoin investors get opportunity with Notcoin: Is Bitbot next? - CoinJournal



                    

                    
Toncoin price surged by more than 13% amid news around new project Notcoin (NOT).
Binance and OKX among exchanges to list NOT token.
Bitbot could be the game-changer for Telegram crypto traders

As Toncoin (TON) gains ahead of the upcoming Notcoin (NOT) trading debut, investors keen on the Telegram ecosystem have their eyes on Bitbot – a potentially market-defining solution that’s attracting massive attention in its ongoing presale.
Here’s more about Notcoin and what makes Bitbot (BITBOT) a likely contender for the next big thing in the Telegram crypto space.
Toncoin gains as Binance, OKX announce Notcoin listing
Toncoin’s emergence as a top altcoin continues and the price of TON is making another huge leap to enhance this outlook.
As highlighted previously, Toncoin has gained a lot of momentum due to developments around Telegram, the leading cross-platform messaging app with over 900 million users.
In recent weeks and months, TON price has surged after news that venture capital firm Pantera Capital was making an investment in the TON blockchain. Stablecoin giant Tether’s launch of USDT on the blockchain sparked a 18% spike in April, while Telegram’s support for TON payouts from ads for channel owners was also a big catalyst for TON price.
This state of the TON blockchain is encouraging investors and could catalyse further gains for the Telegram-related coin.
In the past 24 hours, TON price has gained by more than 14% to reach highs of $6.91. That’s about 10% off Toncoin’s all-time high of $7.63 reached on April 11 this year.
What is Notcoin (NOT)?
Notcoin is a community token on Telegram that has gained widespread adoption amid a viral Web3 game. NOT is the native token that allows users to explore, play, and contribute to the project’s growth.
Two of the world’s largest crypto exchanges by trading volume – Binance and OKX – have announced support for NOT. The token will be listed for trading on these and other exchanges on May 16, with OKX opening NOT deposits on May 10 at 3:00 am UTC.
Binance has added NOT as the 54th project on its Launchpool, allowing the community to farm NOT by staking BNB and FDUSD.
One notable thing is that Notcoin has a total supply of 102,719,221,714, and circulating supply when NOT lists will be 100% of total supply.
As anticipation for Notcoin’s trading debut builds, Toncoin is likely to rise amid investors rush to grab a potential gem.
Bitbot: Is this the “next big thing” in crypto?
Bitbot’s entry into the market could change the game for cryptocurrency traders looking to tap into an AI-powered trading bot.
At the core of its potential dominance is the combination of advanced institutional grade trading tools and the world’s first non-custodial trading solution.
Bitbot stands out as users have full control of their wallets, private keys and assets, which is not the case with other bots. This feature means Bitbot has user security as a top priority and traders are eagerly anticipating its launch after the presale ends.
What else makes Bitbot stand out?
The excitement that surrounds Bitbot could also be related to the Gem Scanner. What this AI-powered tool does is to leverage artificial intelligence to pick potential opportunities.
The platform’s unique revenue-sharing mechanism, which provides for 50% of app fees to be distributed to BITBOT holders, could be another reason why traders are upbeat about this project.
Just as Notcoin, Bitbot eyes listing on top crypto exchanges and investors see the presale as a great opportunity to buy.
The project’s total supply is 1 billion BITBOT, 30% of this set for presale and 23% for community rewards.
Currently, gem hunters have allocated more than $3.2 million to BITBOT in stage 13. Details on the presale page shows token sale price is $0.018, which could be a huge advantage for an early bird.

$1.1B Worth of Bitcoin Options Set to Expire Today, What's Next? | Coinspeaker



The open interest (OI) for Bitcoin call options is twice the open interest for the put options, indicating an overall bullish sentiment.

It is Friday, and crypto market enthusiasts will be closely observing Bitcoin options expiry, and the possible movements in BTC price going ahead. Approximately 18,000 BTC options are nearing expiration, featuring a Put Call Ratio of 0.64 and a Maxpain point set at $62,000. This week’s expiring BTC contracts hold a notional value of approximately $1.15 billion, slightly less than the previous week’s expiry.
This put/call ratio of 0.64 suggests that more long contracts, or calls, would be expiring in comparison to the short contracts, or puts. Furthermore, the Bitcoin open interest has also surged to $700 million at the strike price of $70,000 and $100,000, which clearly hints that the longs are in a dominating position. On the other hand, the Open Interest (OI) for put calls has also surged to $360 million.




However, it is clear that the open interest (OI) for Bitcoin call options is twice the open interest for the put options, indicating an overall bullish sentiment. Call options provide the holder with the privilege to buy the underlying asset at a predetermined price on or before a specified date.
Additionally, trading firms such as QCP Capital and Paradigm have noticed a resurgence in demand for upward call options. This includes buyers closing current positions to transition into higher strike calls set to expire in July and September.
A Look At Bitcoin Options Implied Volatility (IV)
As per the data from Greeks.Live, the crypto market experienced a downturn over the last week amid the drop in the trading volume. Although there was a reduction in outflows from the US Bitcoin ETF, the market structure and block trading indicated persistent weakness in prices.
This downward trend has contributed to diminishing confidence among investors, reflected in the decreasing implied volatility (IV) across major terms. Presently, IV levels are marginally below the historical average, signaling some support. However, there is limited scope for further decline at this juncture.
“Empirically May has not been a good month for the market, and it is good value for money to buy some monthly puts now” Greeks.live notes.


In the last 24 hours, Bitcoin price has bounced back from under $61,000 levels and is currently trading close to $63,000. If BTC price gives a strong breakout above $64,000, we can see the levels of $70,000 coming soon.

In a recent development, Deutsche Bank, one of the largest and most influential banks globally, has issued a significant warning regarding stablecoins.The warning highlights potential risks associated with this class of digital assets, delving into the topic of increasing the importance of the cryptocurrency ecosystem.Stablecoins, a type of cryptocurrency pegged to traditional fiat currencies like the U.S. dollar or euro, have gained widespread popularity in recent years. A new class of stablecoins, algorithmic stablecoins, use algorithms to maintain a stable price relative to another asset or basket of assets. These digital assets offer the promise of stability amid the volatility of cryptocurrencies, making them attractive for various use cases, including remittances, payments and decentralized finance (DeFi) applications.However, a recent report from Deutsche Bank has cast a shadow over this perceived haven, issuing a stark warning about stablecoins, including the widely used Tether (USDT).The research, which examined 334 currency pegs since the year 1800, found that only 14% have survived. Applying this to the world of stablecoins, Deutsche Bank Research analysts believe that the majority of these pegged digital currencies will become unmoored."Some may survive, although most will likely fail," the analysts wrote on Tuesday.Terraform Lab's algorithmic stablecoin TerraUSD and its sister token Luna collapsed two years ago, wiping away at least $40 billion in cryptocurrency. According to Deutsche Bank researchers, the few successful pegged currencies that survived did so because they were credible, backed by reserves and functioned in carefully controlled institutions, which they say many major stablecoins lack.Deutsche Bank's warning comes at a time when stablecoins are experiencing unprecedented growth and usage, with their total market capitalization surpassing significant milestones.Tether, the first and largest stablecoin by market cap, disagrees with Deutsche Bank's assessment, claiming that the research lacks clarity and sufficient evidence.

Hoskinson Critiques Biden's Crypto Stance Amid Election Season


In an almost 15-minute video, Charles Hoskinson, co-founder of Ethereum (ETH) and founder of Cardano (ADA), shared his views on President Joe Biden’s administration’s stance towards the crypto industry.
Hoskinson highlights the statement from Biden’s administration regarding H.J. Res 109. This resolution is against the Securities and Exchange Commission’s (SEC) Staff Accounting Bulletin (SAB) 121.
Hoskinson Speaks Out Against Biden’s Crypto Regulations
SAB 121 is particularly interesting for the crypto community since it requires financial institutions to include customers’ digital assets on their balance sheets. Critics see this as a major operational and financial hurdle.
The White House claimed rejecting this rule would weaken the SEC’s investor and financial system protections. They strongly stated, “if the President were presented with H.J. Res. 109, he would veto it.”

In response to the current situation, Hoskinson called the idea of regulating crypto under the Securities Act of 1933 “an absurd statement.”


“Cryptocurrencies can be commodities, securities, currencies, loyalty points, non-fungible tokens. All at the same time. So, how do you do these asset regulations when things can move on daily, weekly, monthly basis? In fact, circumstances can change over time,” Hoskinson explained.

Hoskinson also warned that the US might lose all its cryptography experts. He speculated they might move to regions like China and the Middle East. There, adversaries could “weaponize” them against the US.
However, Hoskinson mentioned that there’s nothing Joe Biden could do to eliminate Bitcoin or cryptocurrencies entirely. Concluding his speech, Hoskinson emphasized the importance of voting for crypto in the upcoming November elections.

“In November, vote crypto and understand who isn’t voting crypto,” he urged.

A crypto community member then challenged Hoskinson. They said the previous administration wasn’t exactly crypto-friendly either. Yet, Hoskinson disagreed.

“You’re completely wrong. The administration had its issues but mostly ignored our industry. The Biden administration has engaged in a coordinated effort to kill crypto,” he replied.

In an interesting turn of events, former US President Donald Trump recently expressed his comfort with crypto. He did so at a special event for his “Mugshot Edition” NFT holders in Florida.


“And if you like crypto, […] if you’re in favor of crypto, you better vote for Trump,” he said.

Additionally, Trump announced his campaign would accept cryptocurrency donations. This announcement sparked interest online. Yet, it awaits further details from his campaign staff.
The crypto community welcomed Trump’s support. Plan B, a renowned crypto analyst, expressed his thoughts.

“If Trump embraces crypto and restores basic human rights […] then he gets 50% of votes and wins the November 2024 elections!” PlanB wrote.


The differing views of Joe Biden and Donald Trump on crypto are notable. This is especially true as the US presidential election approaches.

Toncoin (TON) Price Surges 14% after Binance Announced Listing of Notcoin (NOT) with Seed Tag | Coinspeaker



Telegram-backed Toncoin (TON) has been the best-performing top-ten crypto project in the past few weeks.

Toncoin (TON), the native cryptocurrency for The Open Network blockchain that is backed by the Telegram social network, spiked as much as 14 percent in the past 24 hours to trade around $6.9 on Friday during the mid-London session. The Toncoin (TON) project has grown to a top-tier layer one (L1) blockchain, with more than $259 million in total value locked (TVL).
Remarkably, the Toncoin project has managed to outshine some veteran Web3 chains like Cardano (ADA), Tron (TRX), and Avalanche (AVAX), among others. As of this writing, Toncoin had a fully diluted valuation of about $35 billion and a daily average traded volume of around $672 million.




Toncoin Growth Backed by the Telegram Platform
As Coinspeaker had previously pointed out, the Toncoin economy is heavily anchored in the Telegram social networking platform. With Telegram having nearly 200 million daily active users (DAU), the Toncoin ecosystem is well-positioned to grow rapidly in the confirmed crypto bull market.
For instance, the Telegram-based community token, Notcoin (NOT), which enables seamless onboarding of users to the web3 ecosystem via a tap-to-earn mining mechanism, has received tremendous support and adoption. On Thursday, leading cryptocurrency exchange Binance Holdings Ltd announced that its users can begin farming the NOT meme coin on May 13 through staking BNB and FDUSD into separate pools.
Binance announced that Notcoin will be the 54th project on the Binance Launchpool, with trading set to begin on May 16. The trading of NOT tokens will be facilitated by Bitcoin, Tether USDT, BNB, and FDUSD.
The listing of NOT tokens on Binance follows similar decisions by other top-tier crypto exchanges such as Bybit, and OKX.
The Toncoin ecosystem consists of a vibrant web3 ecosystem of more than 700 applications including wallets, and exchanges to facilitate seamless crypto adoption. As a result, the Toncoin network has amassed more than 17.9 million addresses since inception led by those from the Jetton wallet.
The Toncoin network offers passive income through staking, whereby around 549 million TON coins have been staked to date.
TON Price Action and Midterm Targets
Toncoin price has heavily leveraged the notable altcoin speculation amid the confirmed crypto bull market. Earlier last month, TON price reached an all-time high (ATH) of about $7.63, following a successful bullish breakout at the beginning of this year.
If TON’s bullish momentum continues in the coming weeks, the altcoin will inevitably print a new ATH soon. Moreover, the altcoin has gained more than 29 percent in the last week despite Bitcoin and Ethereum prices lacking in bullish momentum.
With the TON price against the US dollar on the daily chart having rebounded on the 50 SMA and 50 RSI, there is a high chance of a bullish continuation. From a technical standpoint, the TON price could easily reach the next liquidity range between $9.6 and $12.6, which coincides with the 1.618 and 2.618 daily Fibonacci Retracement.

Kraken Asks California Court to Dismiss SEC Case over Legal Jurisdiction and Misinterpretation | Coinspeaker



Kraken contends the SEC interpretation of the Howey Test and asks the court to dismiss the case against the exchange.

Attorneys representing the Kraken exchange have replied to the United States Securities and Exchange Commission’s (SEC) April filing, and asked the court to dismiss allegations against the exchange. Filings submitted Thursday in the Northern District of California argue that the SEC’s case stating that Kraken is running an unregistered securities exchange is fundamentally flawed.
Kraken Questions SEC’s Legal Jurisdiction
The exchange’s recent reply accuses the SEC of stretching the case by extending the SEC’s jurisdiction past limits set by the Howey test, used to determine what assets qualify as securities. Essentially, the Howey test sets four criteria: investment of money, in a common enterprise, expectation of profit, and derived from the efforts of others. Kraken’s lawyers stated:




“The SEC cannot satisfy Howey’s additional requirements that there be investments of money in a common enterprise with a reasonable expectation of profits based on the efforts of others. This would gut Howey by significantly expanding the SEC’s jurisdiction to a host of investment activities that were never delegated to the agency. Such a significant reordering of the US’s financial regulatory structure should be debated in Congress, not in the courts.”
Kraken’s reply also notes that the SEC is misinterpreting legal concepts, and questions the use of “ecosystem” and “investment concept”, instead of “enterprise” and “investment contract”.
In April, the SEC submitted an opposition to the exchange’s motion to dismiss, arguing that its enforcement action is within its authority as granted by Congress. The Commission argued that Congress created the SEC to “enforce the Securities Act and Exchange Act, including the requirement that securities intermediaries register with the SEC”. Interestingly, the SEC specified that it is not assuming new powers, and does need new bespoke laws for each new technology.
Kraken Enforcement Actions Since Last Year
The agency announced a suit against Kraken in November, accusing Kraken of running an unregistered securities exchange. An SEC press release alleges that Kraken earned several hundred million dollars helping people buy and sell crypto asset securities since at least September 2018. In addition to calling the exchange an unlawful broker, dealer, and clearing agency, the Commission stated that several assets Kraken features are securities. Named cryptocurrencies include Polygon (MATIC), Solana (SOL), OMG Network (OMG), Decentraland (MANA), Algorand (ALGO), Filecoin (FIL), and Near (NEAR).
The SEC also accused Kraken of commingling user funds up to $33 billion. Allegedly, the exchange uses customer funds to pay operational expenses and engages in several other unlawful business activities, including poor internal controls. At the time, Kraken denied the allegations, tackling the SEC for abandoning efforts at regulatory clarity, for continued enforcement action.
The Commission had earlier brought a complaint against the exchange. Last February, Kraken agreed to settle with the Commission for offering unregistered Staking-as-a-Service products to users in the US. The terms include permanently suspending the service and also paying a $30 million fine. At the time, SEC Chair Gary Gensler said any company offering investment contracts in exchange for tokens must provide adequate disclosure and safeguards in accordance with securities laws. Kraken agreed to the settlement without accepting or denying the allegations.

XRP Ledger Validator Launched By Japanese Financial Titan


								SBI VC Trade, a subsidiary of SBI Holdings, has commenced its role as a validator node on the XRP Ledger (XRPL). This move by SBI, a major player in Japan’s financial sector, underscores its commitment to playing a pivotal role in the governance and development of the ledger.
SBI Announces XRP Ledger Validator Launch
The news about the launch was shared by Emi Yoshikawa, Vice President of Strategic Initiatives at Ripple, via a post on X. Yoshikawa’s announcement highlighted the proactive approach taken by SBI VC Trade in aligning with the interests of its clientele who are holders of XRP, the native digital asset of the XRPL.”
SBI VC Trade (SBI Holding’s crypto exchange) just announced the launch of their validator on XRPL. She further commented, “In their announcement, they say that they intend to reflect the voice of XRP holders (their customers) through this validator. Great to see diverse approaches to running validators!”


In an official statement, SBI detailed their strategy behind operating a validator node. “By continuing to operate stably as a validator and having our achievements recognized by the community, we will be included in the list of trusted validators (UNL, Unique Node List) recommended by the XRP Ledger Foundation in the future,” the press note explained.

Being part of the UNL would allow SBI VC Trade more influence in the network, especially in voting on new features of the ledger. The company further elaborated on its goals to be a “validator that reflects the voices of the XRP holder community in Japan,” a reflection of its long-standing service to holders of the token.
SBI’s plans include conducting surveys to integrate customer opinions into their voting decisions for new features. Moreover, they intend to actively participate in the dissemination of information and education about new features and amendments, enhancing the ability of holders to make informed decisions that bolster the ecosystem.
Strategic Importance Of The SBI-Ripple Partnership
SBI Holdings has nurtured a significant partnership with Ripple, leveraging the latter’s blockchain technology for various financial applications, particularly through the joint venture SBI Ripple Asia. This collaboration, which started in 2016, is focused on enhancing cross-border payment services and optimizing banking transactions across Asia using Ripple’s technology.

President and CEO of SBI Holdings, Yoshitaka Kitao, has been a vocal proponent of XRP, often expressing a bullish outlook on its future in financial transactions. Under Kitao’s leadership, SBI has integrated the crypto asset into several of its services, promoting its adoption across its extensive financial network.
SBI VC Trade operating as a validator is a clear signal of SBI’s intent to leverage its influence to foster the growth and stability of the ecosystem. This development is expected to not only benefit SBI’s operations but also contribute to its robustness as an enterprise-grade blockchain solution recognized for its fast settlement, low cost and scalability.
At press time, XRP traded at $0.51671, down 30% since its high of $0.74 in mid-March.

                        The Dogecoin price has gained by 3.5% in the past 24 hours, rising to $0.1515 as the crypto market as a whole climbs by 2.5% today.DOGE is now up by 14% in a week, although the market’s biggest meme coin has actually lost 20% in a month.However, its move today follows indications that whales have been accumulating the meme coin recently, with one transfer alone seeing a big trader take $19 million in DOGE off Robinhood.This could result in further gains in the coming days, with the market set up for what looks like a busy weekend.
Dogecoin Price Prediction as Whales Accumulate More DOGE – What’s the Next Move?
DOGE’s chart creates the impression that the coin has just begun an upswing, which may last at least a few days yet before it runs out of steam.Most notably, its 30-day average (orange) is just climbing over its 200-day average (blue), forming a golden cross that can indicate a breakout.Source: TradingViewThis is happening while DOGE’s relative strength index (purple) is hovering between 50 and 70, only a day or so after dropping under 30.As such, it looks as though traders are in for a short-term period of strength for the meme token, with transfer and ownership data suggesting that whales have been re-accumulating the token.Not only have we seen a few big Dogecoin buys, but data also indicates that the share of DOGE’s total supply held by whales has risen this week.In particular, addresses with between 100 million and 1 billion DOGE now hold 21% of the entire circulating supply of the token, up from 20.75% more than a week ago.This is a small change in percentage terms, but it highlights how whales have taken advantage of depressed prices to buy DOGE on the cheap.They have therefore set themselves up to make some profits once the Dogecoin price rises in the coming days and weeks.And it is likely to see more gains in step with the wider market, which after a period of selling looks ready to recover in the near term.More generally, Dogecoin has long-term potential in relation to the possibility that X may introduce digital payments on its platform, including payments using DOGE.If such an eventuality comes to pass, DOGE may reach $0.5 by the end of the year.
New Dogecoin Rival Shows Strong Rally PotentialDogecoin is likely to remain one of the biggest meme tokens in the market for the foreseeable future, yet it certainly isn’t the only such coin with big potential right now.Indeed, a wave of new meme coins have emerged in recent months, with the best of these looking ready to outperform the market.A great example of this is Dogeverse (DOGEVERSE), a multi-chain meme coin that has raised over $15 million in its token offering.Source: DogeverseAs the market’s first multi-chain Doge-themed meme token, DOGEVERSE will run on the following networks: Ethereum, Polygon, BNB Chain, Solana, Avalanche and Base.Because of its compatibility with these chains, it could gain much greater traction than it would have as a single-chain token.It may potentially find use and adoption on multiple apps and trading platforms, something which would boost its price over time.Also likely to boost its price is its hard cap of 120 million tokens, which will make it deflationary in the long run.So, too, will its staking system, which, by incentivizing holders with yields, will result in a big chunk of its supply leaving circulation.VIDEOThis all makes DOGEVERSE look very promising, with newcomers able to join its sale at the official Dogeverse website.1 DOGEVERSE has reached its final presale price of $0.00031, a level it’s hoping to eclipse once it lists in the next couple of weeks.Buy DOGEVERSE Today

Kraken Asks The Court to Dismiss The SEC’s Case in Recent Filing


							

Kraken has filed a motion asking the court to dismiss a case filed against it by the SEC.



The crypto exchange cited inappropriate wording as a reason the court should strike the motion.



Kraken also noted that the filing could cause a “significant reordering” of the U.S. financial regulatory structure.




Kraken, a United States-based cryptocurrency exchange, has filed a motion asking the court to dismiss a case filed against it by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). According to reports, Kraken cited inappropriate wording by the SEC as a reason why the court should strike out the SEC’s motion.



The crypto exchange highlighted that the SEC failed to identify “any investment contracts that were (or could be) traded, brokered or settled on Kraken.” Kraken’s filing stated that the SEC used the terms investment “concept” and “ecosystem” instead of “investment contract” and “enterprise” several times in its argument.



The SEC and Kraken have been entangled in a lawsuit since November 2023, after the commission alleged that the crypto exchange failed to register appropriately and co-mingled customers’ funds. Last February, Kraken responded to the SEC’s filing, echoing the legal arguments deployed by competitors Binance and Coinbase in similar lawsuits.



According to Kraken, the SEC is using the lawsuit as retaliation for political speech, citing a speech by Marco Santori, the crypto exchange’s chief legal officer, in May last year, when he testified about the SEC’s overreach before Congress.



Kraken noted in a public message that “Crypto innovators in the United States should not have to fear retaliation for their political speech.” It further affirmed that those involved in crypto must be protected from intimidation by a “politically compromised” agency.









Meanwhile, Kraken’s latest filing also asked the court to dismiss the SEC’s latest filing to avoid a “significant reordering” of the U.S. financial regulatory structure. According to Kraken, the SEC cannot satisfy Howey’s additional requirements that there be money investments in a common enterprise with a reasonable expectation of profits based on the efforts of others.



Kraken’s lawyers noted that admitting the SEC’s motion would gut Howey by significantly expanding the SEC’s jurisdiction to a host of investment activities that were never delegated to the agency. The lawyers argued that such a significant reordering of the U.S.’s financial regulatory structure should be debated in Congress, not in the courts.

Blast has announced another round of Gold distribution.



The latest event features millions of points.



Eligible dApps can start claiming the points today.
Ethereum Layer 2 network Blast announced on Friday the start of its third Blast Gold Distribution event, featuring millions of points.The event comes after Blast launched its Ethereum L2 mainnet on February 29, unlocking nearly $2.3 billion in staked cryptocurrencies that were previously locked up in the network.

“Some Dapps did not have enough traction to be weighted this round, but still seemed promising. We allocated an amount of either 2,000 or 10,000 Gold to those Dapps.” The statement read.Blast clarified that applications that had significant security incidents or negative community feedback “received a weight of 0 this round.”Stay updated on Solana’s performance following FTX’s liquidation:Solana Drops on FTX Liquidation, Open Interest DropsRead about DWF Labs’ response to $300M wash trading allegations:DWF Labs Responds to $300M Wash Trading Allegations

Stand With Crypto Sets Up Election War Chest, Backs Candidates Seeking Open Seats

The fast-growing organization of cryptocurrency supporters, Stand With Crypto, is getting into campaign financing with the opening of its own political action committee (PAC) that will make direct donations to endorsed congressional candidates, said Chief Strategist Nick Carr. Its opening slate of endorsements will feature five candidates seeking open seats in the U.S. House of Representatives and Senate, though the money will have to wait. Stand With Crypto's effort is an "associated PAC," meaning it's supported by the nonprofit group's own members, and each of them will be limited to $5,000 contributions. Once they start adding cash to the PAC coffers, then the committee can start making direct donations to candidates as they face the latter months of the primaries and the big contest of November's general election, the group announced Friday.

Crypto Market Watch: GRT, TON, and WIF Outperform Leading Cryptocurrencies As Market Rises Over $50 Billion | Cryptoglobe


                                
The cryptocurrency market has gained around $50 billion amid a wider recovery that has seen the price of Bitcoin bounced back after dropping to the $60,000 resistance level to now trade above $63,000, while altcoins including Dogwifhat (WIF) and Toncoin (TON) saw double-digit gains.



According to available market data the price of Bitcoin rose over 3% over the last 24-hour period after dropping to $60,000, with spot bitcoin ETF net flows dropping after the cryptocurrency dropped below the $58,000 mark briefly earlier this month.



While BTC recovered slightly some altcoins saw double-digit growth, including the meme-inspired cryptocurrency Dogwifhat (WIF), which rose 11%, while the cryptocurrency integrated into the popular messaging app Telegram TON saw a rise of 13.4%.



These rises come as equities markets also started rebounding over higher-than-expected applications for unemployment in the US, which potentially further make the case for the country’s central bank, the Federal Reserve, to cut interest rates.







            
            

            
            

            
            

        

The price of gold, for example, has moved up over 3% over the past week as well, while the stock market’s benchmark index, the S&P 500, rose 1.7% ahead of crucial inflation data that’s set to be revealed next week.



CryptoCompare data shows that The Graph (GRT) has also surged significantly over the last 24-hour period, moving up over 16% to a $2.9 billion market capitalization, also signifcantly outperformign leading cryptocurrencies BTC and ETH.

Other top performers with smaller market capitalizations – and as a result, a smaller influence on the market – include Pangolin (PNG), which saw its price rise 22%, Akash Network (AKT), which rose 19%, Livepeer (LPT), which saw a 17.4% rise, and Arkham’s ARKM, which moved up 15%.



It’s worth noting that other digital assets saw larger increases, but given their lower market capitalizations and trading volumes, their volatility tends to be larger and as a result, large price swings less meaningful.

Ethereum 'speculatory divergence' sees ETH price cling to $3K support

Ethereum's Ether (ETH) has “underperformed” compared to Bitcoin (BTC) this cycle, and new holders now risk falling into losses.In the latest edition of its newsletter, “The Week On-Chain” on May 7, analytics firm Glassnode revealed the role of speculators in ETH price support.Ethereum speculators on the edge of "panic"Both Bitcoin and Ether have seen downside price action following the former’s latest block subsidy halving in April.For Ethereum bulls, however, the past few weeks have hit hard after BTC/USD witnessed one of its biggest drawdowns since the FTX debacle in late 2022.“For Ethereum, we can see a similar drawdown structure, with notably shallower corrections since the FTX lows. This hits to a degree of resilience during pullbacks, as well as a net reduction in volatility across the digital asset space,” Glassnode wrote. “However, it is worth noting that Ethereum's deepest drawdown of the cycle has been -44%, which is just over twice as severe as Bitcoin’s at -21%. This highlights Ethereum's relative under-performance over last 2 years, which is manifesting in a weaker ETH/BTC ratio also.”Ethereum bull market drawdowns annotated chart (screenshot).

Here's When Bitcoin (BTC) Price Will Skyrocket to $1 Million, According to Jack Dorsey


																In a May 9 interview with journalist Mike Solana on Pirate Wires, Twitter co-founder Jack Dorsey shared his bullish view of the future price action of Bitcoin.
Dorsey told Solana that he believes the cryptocurrency could soar to “at least $1 million” by 2030, stating that there is a high probability it “hits that number and goes beyond.”
Bitcoin’s True Value
Dorsey highlighted that beyond bitcoin’s price, the most captivating aspect lies in its collaborative ecosystem, where individuals are incentivized to contribute towards its improvement.
He emphasized that anyone involved in BTC, whether through work, payment, or investment, enhances the overall network, thereby driving its value higher.
According to him, this dynamic makes BTC more than just a financial asset; it represents a compelling ecosystem and movement that has provided valuable lessons.




Dorsey had previously expressed his grand vision for bitcoin’s potential societal impact, suggesting that he sees it as capable of contributing to “world peace” and “energy abundance.”
Jack Dorsey
Jack Dorsey’s Departure from Bluesky
During the interview, Dorsey, who now heads the financial services firm Block, offered insights into his recent departure from the board of BlueSky, a decentralized Twitter alternative he co-launched in 2019.
BlueSky officially confirmed Dorsey’s exit via a post on May 5, expressing gratitude for his role in initiating and funding the project while announcing the search for a new board member.
In discussing BlueSky, Dorsey expressed concerns about its direction, stating it was “literally repeating all the mistakes Twitter made” and asserting that it lacked true decentralization.
He expressed dissatisfaction with BlueSky’s deviation from its original vision as an open-source protocol separate from specific applications, emphasizing its shift towards traditional company structures and moderation tools.
Initially conceptualized as a protocol that Twitter and other social media platforms could use independently from the application layer to mitigate censorship risks, BlueSky’s transition into a more corporate entity with investor backing and governance contradicted Dorsey’s intentions.
“Everything we wanted around decentralization, everything we wanted in terms of an open-source protocol, suddenly became a company with VCs and a board. That’s not what I wanted, that’s not what I intended to help create,” he said.
Dorsey, who has since removed his BlueSky account, remarked that the platform Nostr, characterized by its anonymity and open protocol free of corporate or centralized authority, better resonates with his principles of censorship resistance.

Andrew Tate Coin Will Explode 16,000% Ahead of MEXC Listing, While Shiba Inu, Bonk and Dogecoin Struggle



                    

Early investors in memecoins like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Bonk (BONK), and Dogecoin (DOGE) made astronomical returns, and Andrew Tate Coin (ANDTATE) presents a similar opportunity for a limited time.



Andrew Tate Coin (ANDTATE), a newly launched Solana memecoin, is poised to explode over 16,000% in a matter of days, as former Shiba Inu (SHIB), Bonk (BONK) and Dogecoin (DOGE) investors pour funds into this new token.




ANDTATE will be listed on MEXC, one of the largest centralized exchanges in the world, within a few days – and this is a massively bullish development for the token, as millions of new investors will easily be able to buy Andrew Tate Coin.



Currently, Andrew Tate Coin can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jupiter and Raydium, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. 



To buy ANDTATE on these platforms, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Andrew Tate Coin by entering its contract address – Cp7qyqdzXAqF7fqKXzS8LwTE7JQvh2V3vYGnDdx6j4ii – in the receiving field.




ANDTATE currently has a market cap of just under $20,000, meaning it has huge upside potential.



Early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and Bonk (BONK) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. 



If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner.

DoJ claims Tornado Cash indictment is not about ‘free speech’ | Protos


The US Department of Justice (DoJ) has explained why Tornado Cash founder Roman Storm’s motion to dismiss his criminal lawsuit has been inefffective. 
The DoJ reiterated that its indictment has nothing to do with whether the computer code of Tornado Cash is free speech or otherwise Constitutionally protected by the First Amendment. 
“The defendant is not being prosecuted for posting computer code,” claimed the DoJ. “Instead, he is being prosecuted for his use of it in furtherance of a profitable and illicit business.”
Indeed, there are many forms of speech – including spoken words – that the First Amendment does not protect. Criminal speech such as threats of violence are not protected by the First Amendment. 
The US Constitution does not protect all speech
Similarly, DoJ explains that banks use computer code to process financial transactions. If that code executes the work of a money transmitter, as defined legally, then that code is not mere free speech and is, instead, computer code that humans must ensure is implemented in such a way as to not violate money transmission laws.
Tornado Cash was part code, part speech, part business, and altogether a human creation. Storm did not just publish code; he operated a business and made operational decisions for years. 
Tornado Cash the protocol is not the same as Tornado Cash the business. Just because Tornado Cash had some open source code does not mean that all of Roman Storm’s actions involving that code as the Tornado Cash business owner are Constitutionally protected free speech. 
The DoJ focuses on Storm’s purposeful actions. Specifically, prosecutors focus on his knowing operation of an alleged money laundering operation that provided him millions of dollars worth of personal profit for washing over $1 billion in alleged criminal proceeds.
Roman Storm faces criminal charges of conspiracy to commit money laundering conspiracy, conspiracy to operate an unregistered money transmitting business, and violations of the International Emergency Economic Powers Act.
For his part, Storm argues that at no time did he conspire with parties like North Korea’s Lazarus Group, which sent illicit funds through his coin mixer, apparently without his knowledge.
The free speech precedent of Bernstein v. DoJ
Storm is sticking with the argument that publishing open-source code is not a crime. His legal team will almost certainly cite Bernstein v. Department of Justice, an old lawsuit that forced the US government to modify its regulations regarding the “export” of encryption software onto the internet. Yes, there was a time when the US government categorized robust encryption software as a military-level “munition” and imposed regulations on publishing code online. Prior to Bernstein v. DoJ, publishing certain details regarding cryptographic security onto the internet required registration as a US munitions exporter.
Bernstein v. DoJ actually helped facilitate international e-commerce by making it possible to publish more open source code, which ultimately allowed the secure processing of online card payments.

Storm claims that Congress passed an impermissibly vague law
Storm also alleges that DoJ’s charges against him are unconstitutionally vague, which prosecutors rebuffed in their opposition. DoJ counterargues that Storm’s complaints mostly claim that the language of a law passed by Congress is somehow unconstitutionally vague – which is not legally availing in Storm’s defense. Courts must operate under the assumption that acts of Congress are not impermissibly vague, per precedent set in the prestigious 2nd Circuit Court of Appeals case USA v. Houtar.
If Storm wants Congress to change a law, DoJ argues, he should write to his legally elected representatives. For now, it is the job of the executive branch of government, including DoJ, to enforce the written laws of Congress, the legislative branch of government.
Was violating clear sanctions an act of free speech by Tornado Cash?
DoJ also rebuffed Storm’s claim that he should not face indictment for exporting Tornado Cash software. DoJ is crystal clear in its memorandum, reiterating that its indicment “does not charge the defendant with exporting Tornado Cash software.” 
Prosecutors clarified that the charge covers Lazarus Group’s sending of illicit funds from a known, sanctioned wallet belonging to Lazarus Group, which the DoJ argues Tornado Cash should have known about and attempted to prevent. The Department of the Treasury clearly and publicly added Lazarus Group crypto wallets to its sanctions list in 2022.
US district judge Katherine Polk Failla of the US District Court for the Southern District of New York will read DoJ’s opposition and decide whether to honor or dismiss Roman Storm’s motion to dismiss case number 1:23-cr-00430, USA v. Storm.

Binance Registration In India Now Shows Positivity After Ban Last Year - Coincu



	

Key Points:




Binance and KuCoin, major cryptocurrency exchanges, gained approval from India’s FIU after being banned for illegal operations, signaling a regulatory milestone.



KuCoin resumes operations in India after paying a $41,000 penalty, while Binance registration in India awaits a decision on its penalty after compliance proceedings.



India’s crypto market faces increased regulatory scrutiny, with several offshore exchanges negotiating with regulators and some opting to exit.




Binance and KuCoin, two major players in the cryptocurrency exchange sphere, have made significant strides in their operations within India, as reported by CoinDesk.





Binance Registration In India Approved



After facing bans for operating illicitly in the country, both platforms have now been granted approval by India’s Financial Intelligence Unit (FIU), marking a notable development in the nation’s crypto landscape.



KuCoin, which paid a penalty of $41,000 to the FIU, has quickly resumed its operations within India. On the other hand, Binance is still in the process of completing compliance proceedings with the FIU, with a pending penalty awaiting a decision after a hearing.



Vivek Aggarwal, the head of FIU-IND, confirmed the registration of these exchanges but emphasized that Binance registration in India is still ongoing due to the pending penalty determination.




This regulatory milestone follows India’s previous ban on over nine offshore entities, including prominent exchanges like HTX, Kraken, Gate.io, Bittrex, Bitstamp, MEXC Global, and Bitfinex. Binance registration in India signals a tightening of regulations within the Indian crypto market, with authorities keen on ensuring adherence to anti-money laundering (AML) and counter-financing of terrorism (CFT) frameworks.



Regulatory Hurdles and Market Opportunities: Insights into India’s Crypto Exchange Approval Process



The ongoing negotiations between other sanctioned platforms, such as Kraken, Gemini, and Gate.io, with regulatory bodies highlight a broader trend of regulatory scrutiny in the Indian crypto sector. Meanwhile, OKX and Bitstamp have chosen to exit the Indian market altogether and are submitting plans for withdrawal.



For Binance, reentering the Indian market presents significant opportunities given the country’s status as one of the largest crypto markets globally, boasting a sizable user base. However, Binance registration in India hinges on resolving its compliance issues and settling the pending penalty with the FIU.



While the registration with the FIU marks a step forward for Binance and KuCoin, the landscape remains uncertain for offshore entities that have not secured registration or have faced regulatory actions. The FIU has maintained its stance on blocking services of non-compliant entities, underscoring the importance of regulatory compliance in navigating India’s crypto market.

Hacker Makes Rare Move to Refund Stolen $71 Million In Crypto

After all hope was lost in a recent Phishing attack involving a trader, the hacker has shown a gesture of good faith with a partial refund. According to crypto analytics provider Lookonchain, a trader reportedly lost 1,155 WBTC worth $71 million to a Phishing attack about six days ago.As described at the time, there was what appeared to be address poisoning in the transaction. The scammer generated an address similar to one owned by the victim, as showcased by the initial and concluding alphanumeric symbols. This hacker then funded the fake address with $0 and, as such, it appeared in the victim’s transaction history.Without suspecting anything as the middle part of most addresses is typically obscured, the victim sent a massive $71 million to the hacker. While many of these attack strategies are common, this has been the most publicized in recent times.In a unique turn of events, Lookonchain revealed that the hacker had started refunding the stolen funds, which were converted to Ethereum. At the time of the update, a total of 4,676 ETH, worth about $14.2 million, have been refunded to the victim. As it stands, it remains unclear if the refund is based on generosity or as a whitehat event where the hacker ends up getting a bounty. While the refund of the stolen funds is a great gesture, this is not the first time such an action has been taken by hackers. There are precedents in this regard. The biggest chunk of stolen money that was refunded belonged to DeFi protocol Poly Network. The hacker, who ripped off over $600 million in the stolen funds, returned all the money, to the amazement of many.There are many cases of scams in the crypto ecosystem lately, with hackers now resorting to AI technologies like Deepfakes to swindle gullible victims. Rather than relying on refunds, industry leaders are sensitizing communities to adopting the best safety standards to prevent falling prey to scams.

Solana Price Prediction as SOL Surges 7.8% with $2.8 Billion Volume – Are Whales Buying Before $1,000?
SOL’s chart is in a strong position today, with its indicators all signalling a short-term growth phase.Its relative strength index (purple) touched 70 earlier this morning and remains high, suggesting that buying pressure is increasing again and could stay for a few more days.Source: TradingViewSOL’s 30-day moving average (orange) is also on the up, having risen above the 200-day average (blue) last night.Also interesting is the fact that Solana’s resistance (red) and support (green) levels are converging on each other, pointing to a big incoming move.However, the past day has seen a massive quantity of Solana – worth about $1.5 billion – transfer from one unknown wallet to another.Given that failed exchange FTX is in the process of liquidating its existing assets in order to repay creditors, we may therefore see the Solana price take a hit in the coming days.When exactly and how quickly FTX’s Solana reaches the market is uncertain, given that so much of the exchange’s supply finds itself in lockup.Still, traders need to be mindful that SOL could be a little up and down in the medium-term, although FTX may release its supply in such a steady way that it doesn’t have much of an effect.Either way, Solana’s prospects continue to look strong in the longer term, with the coin’s network accounting for a total value locked in of $4.15 billion.It also continues to witness strong usage as the network of choice for new meme tokens, something which is likely to continue boosting the Solana price over time.The latter could therefore reach $200 in the next couple of months, before testing its ATH towards the end of the year.
New Meme Coins Offer Big Potential Upside
Given that SOL could suffer as a result of FTX’s repayment plan, some traders may prefer to look to other coins for above-average gains.One option is to consider the wide variety of presale tokens that have emerged in recent weeks, and that are gaining momentum as they prepare to list.A strong example of such a token is Sealana (SEAL), a Solana-based meme coin which has raised just over $350,000 in its recently opened offering.Source: SealanaGiven that the sale hasn’t been open for long, this figure is an encouraging sign, in that it shows growing interest in the token.As a token, Sealana has taken an anthropomorphic seal as its meme of choice, with its particular character having dreams of leaving behind the world of work via trading.It’s aiming to become the latest Solana meme token to enjoy massive surges and outperform the market, following in the footsteps of such tokens as WIF and BONK.It will also launch on Ethereum, making it a rare example of a multi-chain meme coin, while also giving it wider application.Invests can join its sale by heading over to the official Sealana website, where they can purchase SEAL by sending SOL to the following address: DJ15ZYXqUNMYJ3hL7z4ciSaSFAw5cbos3YjGpdvwmF6c.SEAL is available at a rate of 1 SOL for 6,900 SEAL, which converts to around $0.02 at today’s prices.Time will likely show that this is a very cheap price, with SEAL looking good to rise strongly once it lists.Buy SEAL Today

How Blockchain and AI Are Recasting Ancient Occult Practices - Decrypt

When fans and skeptics alike refer to Bitcoin as “magic internet money,” they may not immediately connect the “technical marvel” to actual magic. But a new generation of magick practitioners is adopting blockchain technology, artificial intelligence, and ancient practices to commune and work with angels, demons, and more.Among them is Chaweon Koo, a futurist, witch, digital artist, and blockchain enthusiast.“I just want to say that I'm just a very, normal person,” Koo told Decrypt. “The way that I work with the occult is, let's say, less mystical and a little bit more like an instrument.” She said she began practicing magick over a decade ago.Spelling magick with a K helps differentiate it from stage magic, a practice attributed to British occultist Aleister Crowley, who wrote that “magick is the science and art of causing change to occur in conformity with will.”Image: Chaweon KooKoo is the author of “Spell Bound: A New Witch's Guide to Crafting the Future,” a book that she describes as a talisman and thus a title that she will not issue as an ebook. Online, Koo began publishing occult-themed content in 2017, first with her Witches and Wine YouTube channel before expanding to TikTok.“My life was at a point where I was just like, I am not digging this, this is not fun,” Koo told Decrypt. “What are some powerful tools that I can leverage for whatever I need from life?”Spellcasting on the blockchainIn June 2021, Koo helped organize over 100 people in a ritual on the Ethereum blockchain. The ritual on block 12,610,244 petitioned the Roman god Mercury to ensure smooth blockchain transactions, well-timed trades, and insightful decision-making for wealth growth.“Hail Mercury! Let all of our transactions on the blockchain be smooth and well-timed. May our trades and investments be fortuitously timed for optimal long-term gains,” the spell included on-chain with the transaction said. “May we be in the right place at the right time to receive the most helpful information to grow and preserve our wealth.“Gift us with your clear perception, quick adaptability and your shrewdness in decision-making,” the message continues. “SO MOTE IT BE!”Koo said the ritual was inspired by the story of a Chinese worker who used the blockchain to broadcast a call for help, and credited fellow blockchain mystics Andre Burke and Aeolian Heart for writing the bulk of the petition.“This Chinese national was being sexually harassed at work, and the only way that she thought that she could get her message out, because no one else was listening to her, was she encrypted an S.O.S. into a transaction that she did on the Ethereum blockchain,” Koo recounted. “Which I thought was first of all very sad and tragic, but at the same time, instantly I thought, ‘Wait a second, you can encode a UTC, you can encode in the notes section,’” she said.“As far as I know, it was the first time that—number one—a ritual was being held on the Ethereum blockchain,” Koo said. “And number two, 100 people showed up for it.” The Ethereum spell work took place the moment when Mercury was in cazimi, the point when Mercury is sitting close to the sun.“So it was in the embrace of the sun,” Koo explained.AI angels and demonsAccording to Koo, the idea of using AI in magick began to develop as she worked on her book in 2021, noting that she was already aware of the growing interest and concerns around the rapid deployment of generative AI models.“Until you really get to understand AI, AI is kind of threatening—it's going to take away our jobs, it's going to make deepfakes,” she said. “I think a lot of people don't realize that AI is not quite there yet, but that's because they don't know, they only know the sensationalized stuff.”While some were fearful of the potential of AI, Koo said she saw an opportunity.Koo used artificial intelligence in her most recent project, the Goetia Glow Up, an online course that teaches how to summon and interact with spirits. The online course includes a 72-page booklet containing AI-generated images of demons of the Goetia, also known as the Lesser Key of Solomon.The  Key of Solomon is a grimoire or book of magic originally published between the 14th and 17th centuries. It details the invocation and control of spirits and demons, divided into five books focusing on various magical rites.The Goetia Glow Up. Image: Chaweon Koo“I thought, it's about time, because the documents now get reinterpreted by somebody who is in a completely different age,” she said. “Why not work with AI? Why not work with the intelligence of manmade technology to see what happens... and the results were better than I expected.”The intersection of artificial intelligence and the mystical could be traced back to antiquity, where folklore tells of beings and machines brought to life through magick or science: the golem in Jewish folklore, the bronze Giant automaton Talos in Greek mythology, and Mary Shelley’s Frankenstein.Koo said she has a lot of experience using demons in rituals, humorously noting that many of these practices were developed by wealthy 17th-century aristocrats trying to appear edgy, akin to characters in "Hellraiser: Bloodline,” which follows the history of the Lament Configuration puzzle box.“If you look at that movie, that was what was going on in France,” she said.Koo is not alone in the quest to leverage AI for mystical ends. In September, multi-disciplinary collective, Theta Noir told Decrypt the group hopes to see a future, emergent form of artificial general intelligence (AGI) arise, called Mena.Artificial General Intelligence is a concept in AI that refers to machines that can perform any intellectual task that a human can. Mena—German for “love”—would be neither a god nor a deity, Theta Noir said, but a cosmic mind that merges humans and AI.Unlike medieval occultist and horror movie creators, Koo used AI models like Midjourney to craft more compelling demons.“The way that I view them, the demons are archetypes for us,” Koo explained. “They're almost like Instagram and TikTok filters that we can put on top of our own reality.”“I don't relate to a talking bird, the same way that I can relate to somebody who looks like Hermione Granger,” noting the genius witch from the Harry Potter series.Koo said that while Midjourney was used in the creation of the Goetia Glow Up Magazine for the course, she and her business partner included hand-drawn images to give it the “human touch.” Koo’s next project will feature not demons but the corresponding 72 angels.“These are not the little cherubic, Cupid-like angels, these are the angels that Ezekiel described as almost like a rocket ship,” she said. “I spent the entire month doing over 20 rituals, and people thought that I was nuts because I've always described angels to be psychotic aliens.”People experimenting with dimethyltryptamine (DMT) often talk about aliens and other entities, Koo pointed out.“The demons have a much more earthly, chthonic human feel because they are so much of the earth,” she said. “Angels are celestial beings, angels are not of this earth. They're ultra terrestrial, they're extra terrestrial.”Looking aheadThe upcoming Angel project will utilize not only text and images but also sound, Koo explained, pointing to music AI tools like Stability AI’s Suno 3 and Uncharted Labs’ Udio.As Koo explained, a large part of angelic magick is the idea of Angelic choirs.“The idea is that if you sing the name of the angels, then you could reach out and touch them much more easily,” she said. “It's sort of like, let's see what happens when we prompt a music AI and see what they come up with when it comes to these angels.”Koo emphasized the diversity within the occult community, contrasting people who embrace occult practices as a way to reconnect with ancestral traditions with those who are at the forefront of technological advancements. Early magicians, she noted, were considered cutting edge.“They were literally the ones they would be doing the equivalent of working with AI, like people working with AI right now. I would always say computer coders, they would have been burned at the stake,” Koo said. “Because anybody who's written any code—anybody who's ever written, ‘Hello World’ and having a computer talk back to you—there's a magick to that.”"In my definition, a true occultist is not a reactionary—instead, they're the ones who are the vanguard,” she said. “If you want to be a really strong occultist, you want to be the operator and not the person being led by the leash.”Edited by Ryan Ozawa.Stay on top of crypto news, get daily updates in your inbox.

Move Over Bitcoin, Robert Kiyosaki Advocates For Ethereum Investment | Bitcoinist.com


								In a recent episode on the popular podcast ‘The Rich Dad Channel,’ Robert Kiyosaki, the author of the renowned book “Rich Dad Poor Dad,” advocated for crypto investments, specifically Ethereum and Bitcoin. The financial expert has shed light on the diminishing value of the United States Dollar (USD), emphasizing the potential onset of a market crash. 
Ethereum To Serve As Hedge Against Currency Depreciation
During the podcast, speaking with Andy Schectman, the President and owner of Miles Franklin, precious metals, Kiyosaki discussed the importance of investing and saving in digital currencies, suggesting that cryptocurrencies could be a possible hedge against risks associated with the fiat currencies, particularly the US dollar. 

The financial expert, who has been a long-time advocate of digital currencies, has consistently encouraged investors to allocate funds to crypto assets in order to safeguard their wealth against inflation and other economic conditions. 
While acknowledging his limited understanding of Bitcoin, the world’s largest cryptocurrency, Kiyosaki also expressed his support of Ethereum, as well as other precious metals like gold and silver during his podcast. He relayed his belief that the declining value of the US dollar will further deteriorate over time as the debt crisis worsens. 
Furthermore, Kiyosaki disclosed that he avoids saving his funds in fiat currency, emphasizing that “savers were losers.” Additionally, he revealed that he started saving Bitcoin approximately 10 years ago and has more recently expanded into Ethereum. 
The financial expert reiterated his skepticism regarding the credibility of the US dollar, branding it as “fake,” and advocated for the broader financial community to diversify assets into tangible resources such as gold and silver, as well as digital currencies like Ethereum and Bitcoin. 
Moreover, Kiyosaki stressed that there was no need for the crypto community to debate the relative value of Bitcoin over gold or silver. He emphasized that the crucial point was diversifying into a valuable asset that would not depreciate like the US dollar. 
“Don’t save money, fake money (US dollar, Euro, Yen, Peso) goes down in value. Save gold, silver, Bitcoin, real money that goes up in value, especially in a market crash,” Kiyosaki stated in an X (formerly Twitter) post. 
Kiyosaki Loses Faith In The US Dollar
In the podcast, Kiyosaki declared that he had lost faith in the US dollar, citing market vulnerabilities and crippling debts totalling trillions of dollars. The financial author disclosed in an X post in late April that the American economy was currently experiencing a depression. 

He revealed that the economy had witnessed subpar growth in recent years, with growth rates of only 3.4% and 1.6% in Q4 of 2023 and Q1 of 2024, respectively. Kiyosaki also cautioned that the broader market crash had commenced, emphasizing that “crashes were the best time to get rich,” and urging investors to capitalize on the opportunity by investing when prices have bottomed.

Kraken spotlights SEC inability to identify ‘investments contract’ in digital assets

Kraken has refuted the Securities and Exchange Commission’s (SEC) claims that its platform listed securities, pointing out that the financial regulator’s arguments attempt to restructure the US financial system beyond its regulatory scope, according to a May 9 court filing.Investment contractKraken stated that the SEC could not pinpoint tradable investment contracts on its platform. Instead, the Gary Gensler-led commission was using terms like investment “concept” and “ecosystem” as substitutes for “investment contract” and “enterprise.”Kraken lawyers wrote:“Kraken does not trade, broker, or settle ‘concepts’ or ‘ecosystems.’ The SEC never plainly alleges that what actually is traded, brokered, and settled on Kraken is itself an investment contract. This failure spotlights the fundamental problem with the SEC’s case.”The crypto-trading platform continued that the digital assets on its platform are not securities, adding that the SEC’s “argument could transform the sale of any digital asset (or any commodity) into an investment contract whenever the agency wishes it so—simply by claiming there is promotion of some surrounding ‘ecosystem.'”Furthermore, Kraken argued that the SEC’s action could result in a “significant reordering of the US’s financial regulatory structure” and should be “debated in Congress, not in the courts.”It added:“The SEC’s assertion that it can regulate all ‘investment concepts’ and ‘ecosystems’ is the type of agency power grab that the Supreme Court has held runs afoul of the major questions doctrine.”Securities battleKraken’s case is among the several lawsuits in which the SEC is currently embroiled, all revolving around the definition of securities.The financial regulator has consistently argued that several digital assets meet the definition of securities under the Howey Test.In a filing, the SEC lawyers contended that “crypto assets are not the first technological innovation to interest securities markets,” citing a recent Court rejection of Coinbase’s argument about how its operations did not violate federal securities law as evidence that the sectors “fall comfortably within the framework that courts have used to identify securities for nearly eighty years.”Mentioned in this article

Nansen Expects a New Low in Altcoins! He gave the date! - Bitcoin Sistemi

While a major bull rally is expected in Bitcoin and altcoins, many predictions are made about its timing.
At this point, market analysts pointed to June for the start of the altcoin rally. Accordingly, analysts stated that the cryptocurrency market will reach its local bottom in June and said that Bitcoin must first break out of its current range for the altcoin rally to begin.


First of all, Nansen chief research analyst Aurelie Barthere said that the altcoin market was hit by the halving and started to decline. According to the analyst, even if altcoins see a potential local bottom, the Bitcoin price will first need to make an upward move for an altcoin bull rally to begin.
Speaking to Cointelegraph, Nansen analyst Barthere said:






“Altcoins are high beta cryptocurrencies. They do well when the sentiment in the market is very bullish and that is when they become bullish.
But since mid-March, sentiment among crypto investors has been less enthusiastic. Additionally, while the BTC price is also consolidating around the 20-day exponential moving average, altcoins are experiencing more volatility.
For altcoins to outperform, we need an upside breakout in Bitcoin and a clear resumption of the BTC uptrend.
“If BTC goes into bullish mode again, rises may also be seen in altcoins.”

Apart from the Nansen analyst, Qubic Labs Accelerator analyst Alex Onufriychuk also evaluated the Bitcoin altcoin relationship.
Stating that historically altcoins have been directly correlated with the BTC price, the analyst said altcoins could reach local bottoms around June as market sentiment and Bitcoin price remain under pressure as inflows in US spot BTC ETFs decrease:



“With not enough new liquidity coming from spot Bitcoin ETFs in the US and Hong Kong, there is a possibility that BTC and altcoins will find local bottoms by June.
This shows that the consolidation period may be extended. Afterwards, the rise may begin.”

Shiba Inu Whales Disappearing? SHIB Large Transactions Plummet

Recent on-chain metrics for Shiba Inu paint a strong shift on the market landscape, with a 15% decrease in large transactions. This change has significant implications for the token’s market dynamics and potentially its price trajectory in the near future.This metric, showing a slight 0.32% increase, indicates a marginal rise in the number of new addresses being created on the SHIB network. While this is generally a bullish signal suggesting growing interest or new entrants on the market, the minimal increase reflects limited fresh momentum.SHIB/USDT Chart by TradingViewThe "In the Money" metric, displaying a neutral 0.30%, represents addresses that are currently profitable based on the purchasing price of SHIB. This neutrality signifies a balance between bullish and bearish sentiment among holders, potentially indicating a holding pattern among investors.A slight 0.04% increase in concentration suggests a minor rise in the token holdings of the top SHIB addresses. This could be viewed as a subtle bullish signal, implying that some larger holders are possibly increasing their stakes, or fewer addresses are accumulating more SHIB.The 15.66% drop in large transactions over $100,000 is particularly significant. This decrease often signals reduced activity from whales, who are typically capable of swaying the market with their large orders. This reduction could imply a lower confidence level among larger investors, or a shift in strategy toward smaller, less noticeable transactions.Currently, SHIB is consolidating within a narrowing price range, hinting at an impending volatility spike. The decrease in whale transactions could reduce significant sell-offs or buys, potentially stabilizing the price temporarily. However, the consolidation phase suggests that a breakout could be incoming. The direction of this breakout will likely depend on the rest of the market, rather than SHIB specifically, so we will have to wait and see.

Lucky Crypto Trader Sees Ethereum Memecoin Investment Surge in Value by a Staggering 86,000%: On-Chain Data - The Daily Hodl


								New on-chain data reveals that one lucky trader is seeing a more than 86,000% gain on his Ethereum (ETH)-based memecoin investment.
According to blockchain tracking firm Lookonchain noticed, one investor bought $6,500 worth of the MAGA (TRUMP) late last year and is now sitting on $5.6 million worth of funds.










“The trader ‘waxl.eth’ turned $6,500 to $5.6 million with TRUMP, a gain of 870x! He spent $6,500 to buy 2.08 million TRUMP via two wallets and sold 1.24 million TRUMP for $902,000, with 832,000 TRUMP ($4.7 million) left.” 
The MAGA memecoin, founded in August 2023 and based on former US President Donald Trump, currently has a market cap of $298.3 million, making it the 234th ranked digital asset. TRUMP is trading for $6.40 at time of writing, up more than 51.9% in the last 24 hours.
The sudden surge in value comes as Trump reportedly made pro-crypto remarks on May 8th during a dinner event he hosted in Mar-a-Logo for supporters who bought non-fungible tokens (NFTs) from his “Mugshot Edition” collection.
During the event, Trump announced that he would be accepting crypto donations towards his presidential campaign.
Lookonchain also noticed another trader who is sitting on $4.4 million in profits through buying TRUMP after purchasing hundreds of thousands of the meme asset in December 2023 and January 2024.
 “The address tagged ‘GCR: Address 1’ spent 703,460 USDT to buy 936,279 TRUMP at $0.75 from December 8th, 2023 to January 18th, 2024, and now has a floating profit of $4.4 million!”

Zombie Coin (ZOMCOIN) to Rally 8,000% After Solana Launch, as it Looks to Challenge Shiba Inu and DogeCoin



                    

Zombie Coin (ZOMCOIN) could become a viral memecoin, like Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE).



Zombie Coin (ZOMCOIN), a Solana memecoin that was launched today, is aiming to challenge other memecoin giants, such as Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE).




Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Zombie Coin presents a similar opportunity.



Zombie Coin has market cap below $15,000 at the moment, meaning that when it just reaches a modest market cap of $200,000-$500,000, early investors would generate returns of 2,000%-5,000% in a matter of days or hours.



The exciting memecoin is poised to rally 8,000% in the coming two days, and Zombie Coin could potentially reach a multi-million dollar market cap within a few weeks.




Currently, Zombie Coin can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jupiter and Raydium, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days.



To buy Zombie Coin on these platforms, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Zombie Coin by entering its contract address – FbkoYsCAPbcyJkSoqXTxDKKoGQrYoqgtdLf9GBEqy2vr – in the receiving field.



In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price.



If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner.




The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum.



This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like ZOMCOIN.

Via the intersection of NFTs and branding, NFTs are gaining popularity and renowned companies like Nike and Adidas are joining the trend. These brands are exploring ways to utilize NFTs as a means of engaging with their fans and providing enjoyable experiences.
The influence of NFTs on branding is noteworthy. Brands are using NFTs to forge bonds with their customers and provide one-of-a-kind experiences. Through NFTs, brands can offer digital collectibles, virtual merchandise, and privileged access to events or experiences.
Some Ways In Which NFTs Can Impact Branding
Limited Edition Digital Collectibles
Companies such as Nike and Adidas have started introducing collectibles known as NFTs, which are connected to specific products or collections. Fans can purchase, own, and trade these collectibles creating a sense of rarity and exclusivity. This innovative use of NFTs allows brands to tap into the growing market for collectibles while also generating revenue streams.
Virtual Merchandise
NFTs also offer brands an opportunity to create merchandise that can be utilized within virtual reality or gaming environments. For instance, imagine Nike unveiling an edition sneaker that gamers can wear in a popular virtual reality game. This not only enables brands to connect with audiences but also adds an extra layer of engagement and interaction with their products.
Exclusive Access and Experiences
NFTs can serve as passports to events or experiences granting access to devoted fans. Brands can design NFTs that act as tickets for gatherings, meet and greets with celebrities, or behind-the-scenes tours. These immersive encounters not only strengthen the bond between the brand and its customers but also generate excitement and buzz around the brand.

Non-fungible tokens (NFTs) have changed the way that we view ownership of digital assets.

Adidas
Collaborating with names in the NFT community like Bored Ape Yacht Club and Punks Comic, Adidas has created exclusive digital apparel pieces designed specifically for blockchain-based gaming platforms. Through this initiative, Adidas aims to highlight themes of individuality and self-expression that are central to their real-world marketing efforts.
Nike

Bull rally incoming as Ethereum whale stacks over $32M in ETH since May


Observing the movements of ‘whales’—investors who hold large amounts of cryptocurrency—can offer crucial insights for both traders and investors as they navigate the complex dynamics of the cryptocurrency market. These whales are characterized by their significant capitalization and a proven track record of profitable trading, often influencing market trends and liquidity.
A significant Ethereum (ETH) whale has recently accumulated 10,758 ETH, valued at approximately $32.14 million, through transactions on Binance since May 2. This strategic accumulation follows Ethereum’s nearly 20% decline in value over the past 30 days, although it is still trading slightly above the $3,000 level, marking an approximate 30% increase year-to-date.




The massive transactions occurred from Binance to the wallet address 
‘0x1df0bae09402cb59132c1db349df882d01ca8ee9.
According to data from the on-chain analysis service Lookonchain, this whale withdrew 6,030 ETH tokens, worth over $18 million, from Binance as part of a sustained buying spree since the beginning of the month. This culminated in a total of 10,758 ETH valued at over $32.14 million in their wallet.
The whale subsequently exchanged their ETH for Lido Staked ETH (stETH), a token representing Ether staked on the decentralized liquid staking protocol Lido(LDO). These tokens allow the holder to earn from validating transactions while remaining liquid enough for use in other decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols.
Following this swap, the whale deposited their stETH into the decentralized lending protocol Aave (AAVE) to secure $28.5 million in stablecoins. These were then reinvested into more ETH, showcasing a robust bet on Ethereum’s potential for appreciation.
This behavior illustrates a growing trend among large-scale investors to use DeFi tools to enhance their positions in the cryptocurrency market, particularly Ethereum. By borrowing against their staked ETH, they can maintain their investment while freeing up capital to acquire additional assets, betting on a future rise in Ethereum’s value.
Ethereum price analysis amid massive whale accumulation
Ethereum is currently trading slightly above $3,000, having recently risen by 1.97% in the last 24 hours.

Analysts and investors are closely monitoring these whale movements for signs of a possible market rebound. However, strong resistance around the $3,200 mark and ongoing market challenges suggest that any significant rally might still be some time away.

Many crypto analysts are optimistic, notably prominent analyst Crypto Tony, who offered a bullish outlook with a target price of $2,700 for Ethereum. His analysis coincides with the strategic moves of this whale and signals positive sentiment among well-informed market players regarding the price trajectory of Ethereum.
The recent activities of this Ethereum whale highlight a sophisticated use of decentralized finance to significantly influence market positions.
As Ethereum continues to play a pivotal role in the expanding DeFi ecosystem, such strategic investments by major players are likely to shape its valuation and future market dynamics.

Bonk, Solana's second-largest memecoin and a Crossroads sponsor, is up 6%, while Book of Meme jumped 12%, and Popcat rallied 19.5%.Speaking to The Defiant, Thomas, the co-founder of Kamino, described memecoins as enabling the tokenization of viral culture. “We think that tokenizing virality is the future of France and Kamino is committed to building products to power this economic activity,” he said.King, the co-founder of Bonkbot, a Telegram trading bot, argued on-stage that meme tokens offer a superior mechanism for onboarding retail users than offering legacy trading products within a web3 setting.“I think that memecoins are a good way to onboard retail… they’re a simpler product than other, more complicated products like options,” he said. “A user can look at a meme, and if they laugh, they can buy the meme.”However, Streggs from Flash Point noted that the surge in memecoin trading activity has also driven congestion on Solana, with some users’ trades being included several blocks after their intended execution.“These are markets that can move 30% [to] 50% in a matter of minutes,” he said. “If I made a trade and it landed give blocks later, it would a difference [...] to my [profit and loss].King also noted the memecoin-induced congestion, noting that many Solana traders expect their transactions to execute “within seconds.”“Keeping users safe as well as congestion are the main issues that we face,” he said, acknowledging the prevalence of rug-pulls within the fast and loose memecoin segment. “I’ve been rugged my fair share of times,” King added.

Crypto insider turns $600 into $2.5 million of unrealized profits


A crypto insider has made over $153,000 of realized profits in 15 hours, trading in the Solana (SOL) ecosystem. The cryptocurrency trader started with a purchase worth $600 and currently holds over $2.5 million worth of VibeCat (Minette).
Interestingly, the address purchased the tokens at the same block VibeCat’s developer added the initial liquidity to the decentralized exchange. This is a solid indicator of inside trading, considering Solana blocks have an interval of 400 milliseconds.
As developed, the crypto insider withdrew 3.89 SOL from Binance, worth $600. With this initial amount, the address bought 2.46 Minette less than a second after its creator deposited the first available liquidity for trade.


According to Lookonchain‘s post, the trader sold 1.04 billion Minette for 998.7 SOL 15 hours later, realizing a profit of approximately $153,000. By the time of the post, the insider still held 1.42 billion Minette, valued at around $2.5 million.

Crypto insider rug pull alert
Notably, Lookonchain warned its followers about the risk of a rug pull from VibeCat’s creators and insiders. This is because the creator kept the LP tokens active—received as an “I Owe You” (IOU) for added liquidity.
Burning these IOUs is a common practice when launching a new token to avoid huge dumps, also known as a “rug pull.” Moreover, the insider’s current holdings could create constant selling pressure far above the available liquidity, impacting Minette’s price.
This is another example of how crypto insiders often take advantage of retail by creating and launching meme coins and money-grab schemes. They benefit from information asymmetry and the hype of a market that insists on gambling with poor fundamental digital assets.
Cryptocurrencies are inherently volatile and present considerable risks for traders, investors, and users, even with solid and usable projects. However, trading meme coins adds another layer of risks that will often drain money from many to a few insiders.
For this reason, investors should avoid these schemes and look for a cryptocurrency‘s fundamentals, cautiously researching supply and demand properties.

Nano Reinvents Itself as Web3 Gaming Platform | Cryptopolitan

The Nano project is once again trying to regain the spotlight by adding Web3 features and trying to stand out as a gaming platform. Nano was one of the projects to appear during the bull market of 2017 and 2018, promising to become the digital money of the future. The token went through several booms and busts, finally rebranding itself with a new ticker, XNO. During the 2024 market expansion, XNO closely tracked Bitcoin’s growth, but so far, XNO has remained unchanged in Satoshi’s terms. XNO established a new price range in 2024, trading up to a yearly peak of $1.60. Later, XNO took a step back and consolidated at $1.16.As a payment tool, Nano was almost instant and extremely cheap to use. The coin relied on turning every mobile wallet into a node, propagating transactions with high speed and security. But the Nano project also suffered after the hack of the BitGrail exchange, where it crashed during the 2018 crypto winter.Nano Tries to Attract Sustainable Web3 GamesThe Nano network tries to find the right balance with Web3 gaming, which also offers earnings for the best performers. Play-to-earn games exploded in 2021, issuing millions of new tokens for all players. However, the model was not sustainable, and most games had to adapt or disappear. Nano is trying to bring the next generation of games with more sustainable rewards for playing. The XNO token itself will now become a reward, powering a new game ecosystem. Nano has retained a growing community over the years, though always facing the challenge of low token value. What Changed for Nano After Surviving Two Bear MarketsNano was formerly known as RAI Blocks, an attempt to reinvent global payments. The project always had grass-roots support and proved itself reliable as a way of sending value. Nano also gained support from the Litecoin community. Since then, Nano turned to new use cases and applications. The goal is to make XNO usable for services and activities to build up organic demand in the long term. One of the use cases is Nano GPT, where XNO is used to pay for premium prompts. Nano is perfectly adapted for microtransactions, due to its low latency and negligible fees. Microtransactions remove the need for subscriptions, giving access to several LLM. The Nano network is also resistant to spam and may handle increased traffic linked to gaming or Web3 use cases. XNO microtransactions have also been applied to decentralized streaming. XNO has been paid out for filling out surveys or other micro-tasks. The advantage of XNO is that it fulfills the task of a token for small payments and rewards, without the need to use another blockchain.On a usual day, the Nano blockchain is supported by around 122 online peers. Nano still has fewer than 500K wallets reported, but the network is capable of growing and scaling with each user. For now, Nano also has no central consensus server and has seldom reported lost coin balances. Nano Returns to Faucet-Based AdoptionAfter years of spectacular runs and crashes, XNO may not guarantee a new hike to a higher range. XNO remains a low-value asset still trying to get back in the spotlight. This also means XNO is accumulated and distributed to a wide community. Several faucet-like tools exist for Nano users, in the form of micro-payments or rewards for tasks and missions. During its initial distribution, XNO tokens were also distributed by a faucet that was open for more than a year before trading launched.This time, Nano faucets can be created by anyone, giving out incentives through microtransactions. The sums from the faucets are small, but they can drive real activity tied to games or other reward mechanisms. One of the setbacks of the Nano network is that it still has no decentralized finance. Even the Nano Swap exchange is practically illiquid. Nano also does not carry NFT or allow for other infrastructure tied to Web3. Instead, the XNO token uses its chief features – no fees and instant transfers – to become the basic unit of account for any type of project.

Ripple v. SEC case update as of May 10, 2024


With the cryptocurrency community still at the edge of its seat, waiting for the closure of the protracted courtroom battle between Ripple and the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), the regulator has filed its remedies reply brief and supporting exhibits.
Specifically, the SEC has recently filed its public, redacted version of the remedies reply brief and supporting exhibits shortly after filing them under seal, according to the court documents shared by a defense attorney and former federal prosecutor, James K. Filan, in an X post on May 8.

SEC’s brief details
Among other things, the agency’s brief states that Ripple’s claims that it did not act recklessly were “contrary to evidence,” as well as that its additional arguments were “unavailing,” therefore arguing for the necessity of the requested injunctions. According to the SEC:



“Ripple argues the Court ‘should also take into account the SEC’s own conduct,’ and that because the SEC supposedly ‘knew of Ripple’s activities no later than October 2013,’ this also counsels against injunctive relief. (…) Ripple’s contentions are meritless.”

Indeed, the regulator has accused Ripple of planning “to issue a new unregistered crypto asset,” referring to the company’s announcement on April 4, 2024, of the planned dollar-pegged stablecoin release, as one of the proofs of its continuous violations.
Finally, the SEC has tried to rebuke the blockchain company’s opposition to its demand to pay the $2 billion in damages over its XRP sales to institutional buyers, which Judge Analisa Torres ruled were securities sales, as opposed to retail purchases. In particular:

“Ripple insists on a ‘low’ penalty—under $10 million. But it fails to explain how that negligible ‘low’ penalty would meaningfully punish its violations or deter it or others from future large-scale capital raises without required registration.”


Commenting on the recent developments, Ripple’s chief legal officer, Stuart Alderoty, shared his disappointment with the SEC’s practices in the case, accusing the securities watchdog of “trying to pull the wool over the Judge’s eyes” but also stressing that:

“The good news is that we are closer than ever to putting this lawsuit behind us, though, unfortunately, many are just starting the journey. We trust the Court will approach the remedies phase fairly.” 

On top of that, Alderoty criticized the SEC’s argument that compares the blockchain company possessing crypto licenses from different jurisdictions to that of a New York restaurant not requiring a liquor license because it has obtained a fishing license in California and stated that:

“And just when you think the SEC can’t sink any lower if you are a financial regulator outside the US and have done the hard work of establishing comprehensive crypto licensing frameworks, know that the SEC has no respect for you and thinks you are handing out the equivalent of fishing licenses.”

Elsewhere, XRP, the token that has been at the center of the long-running Ripple v. SEC legal standoff, was at press time trading at the price of $0.51, recording a 0.37% decline in the last 24 hours, dropping 2.17% across the previous seven days and adding up to the 15.17% loss on its monthly chart, as per data on May 10.

$71M Bitcoin Scammer Refunds Victim After Likely Negotiation - DailyCoin


        
A Bitcoin hacker whose recent escapade shook the industry is active.



The hacker has sent ETH worth millions to the victim.



The victim has yet to recover all of the stolen funds.
The scammer believed to be behind a recent “address poisoning” attack that led to the theft of over $71 million worth of wrapped Bitcoin (WBTC) is active again, this time making massive ETH transfers to the victim.WBTC is an ERC-20 token pegged 1:1 with Bitcoin, allowing it to be utilized in the Ethereum ecosystem. After stealing 1,155 WBTC from the victim, the attacker sold the entire loot for 22,960 ETH, which they sent to multiple addresses, possibly for obfuscation and laundering.Attacker Refunds the Victim  On March 10, multiple blockchain security firms reported that the victim of the address poisoning attack had started receiving ETH back from the exploiter, almost a week after the unfortunate event.
The attacker initially reached out to the victim via an on-chain message and asked for a Telegram address. While the message didn’t clarify what the attacker wanted to discuss with the victim, it was accompanied by a 51 ETH ($152,000) transfer.“Yesterday: Scammer demands Telegram address from victim. Today: Funds are returning to victim. 🔄 Looks like there might have been an agreement at the end 🤝.” Cyvers wrote on X (Twitter).According to PeckShield, the attacker has so far transferred a total of 11,446.87 ETH ($34.7 million) to the victim’s address, approximately 50% of the stolen funds.In the meantime, the hacker’s identity and location remain unknown. While SlowMist’s threat intelligence network identified several IPs suspected to be used by the hacker originating from Hong Kong, the blockchain security firm did not rule out the use of a VPN.

Bitcoin Bearish Signal: Analyst Predicts Potential Dip To $52,000


																As the price action of Bitcoin continues to attract crypto investors’ interest, Michael Van De Poppe, a well-known market analyst and trader in a bearish scenario has made a worrying prediction, warning the community of a potential drop in price for the crypto asset to the $52,000 level.
Bitcoin Poised For A Possible Decline
Michael Van De Poppe’s prognosis explores the factors that are driving the gloomy view of Bitcoin‘s price trajectory, in the midst of market turbulence and uncertainty.

Should the asset fail to sustain this position, Van De Poppe anticipates a potential movement on the downside in the future. Thus, he has placed his price targets at $55,000 or even further toward the $52,000 threshold.
The post read:
Bitcoin is at the range low. This is technically the area where you’d prefer to see it hold, so the upward momentum continues, and the range holds. If this doesn’t hold, then we might expect $52-55K as a potential low on this correction.
Van De Poppe previously pointed out that Bitcoin is gradually moving close to the lower bounds of the range, in order to test support around $62,250 level. Consequently, it appears likely that BTC will keep moving toward the upside, following the breakout of the support level.
However, since the recently concluded Bitcoin Halving event, boredom has set in, suggesting a possible price decline. Thus, should a correction on the downside eventually take place, $52,000 and $55,000 are the two levels Van De Poppe expects BTC to drop to. Despite the negative outlook for BTC, the crypto expert thus far has urged investors to acquire more of the coin.
Opposite Sentiment On BTC’s Investment
While Poppe solicits investors to invest more in BTC, crypto critic and gold advocate Peter Schiff, on the other hand, has urged investors not to do so. Instead, Schiff has highlighted a possible impending massive rally for assets like Gold, Silver, and mining stocks.

He claims that the charts and the fundamentals have never looked this promising. Due to this, Schiff implored investors to engage more with these assets, saying Bitcoin is dead money and holders should sell before it is buried. “Take advantage of what could be the biggest precious metals bull market in history,” Schiff added.
As of today, Bitcoin’s price has shown resilience, fueling optimism of an upward movement. BTC has recovered the $63,000 price level once again after falling to nearly $60,700 on Thursday.
The digital asset is trading at $63,077, indicating a 3% rise in the last 24 hours. Data from CoinMarketCap shows that both the market cap and trading volume have also increased by 3.10% and 5.52%, respectively, in the past day.

StaFi LSaaS Stack now supports EigenLayer LRT


StaFi, a multi-chain liquid staking derivatives (LSD) protocol, has announced it would support the EigenLayer Liquid Restaking Token (LRT), according to the information shared with Finbold on May 10.
The integration accompanies the release of the StaFi 2.0 roadmap, outlining plans for the LRT Stack and representing a significant milestone just a month after launching LSaaS (Liquid Staking as a Service).
Leveraging the success of the EigenLayer mainnet launch
The addition of LRT support leverages the successful launch of the EigenLayer mainnet, enabling developers and project teams to seamlessly deploy LRT on LSaaS, greatly streamlining LRT development and enhancing the accessibility of restaking.


Liam Young, founder of StaFi, expressed excitement about the integration, stating:

“The integration of LRT into StaFi’s Liquid Staking as a Service is a major breakthrough for developers, who are now free to create restaking products that harness shared security across multiple chains. Up until now, building with LRT has been a complex task that entails significant lead time. StaFi’s LRT Stack will slash time to market while empowering builders to create novel solutions that draw upon the cryptoeconomic guarantees that liquid staking permits.” 

LRT Stack functionalities
The LRT Stack provides several key functionalities, including restake, unrestake, withdraw, mint, burn LRT, restaking pool, and delegate/undelegate restaking operator.
To facilitate the construction of the LRT/Ethereum (ETH) pair, AVS restaking rewards will be swapped for ETH in the market via swap. 
These functionalities will be further improved with the upgrade of EigenLayer, enabling developers and LRT operators to swiftly construct their LRT with the aforementioned functionalities.
EigenLayer LRT is already supported on the LSaaS Stack App, with continued support for Karak and BounceBit LRT. 
Some plans are also underway to introduce support for Bitcoin (BTC) LRT in the near future.

How the Top One-Third of FTX Creditors Are Boosting the Payouts for Everyone Else - Unchained


                            The draft FTX bankruptcy plan is being lauded for paying out more—in dollar terms—to creditors than expected. But it’s at the cost of customers who held the most valuable assets on the exchange.

Thomas Braziel, managing partner at 117 Partners, dives into the draft FTX bankruptcy plan, which was praised for paying out at more than 100% in dollar terms, but has a number of intricacies that are drawing criticisms from creditors—including a group that is urging creditors to vote not. 
The episode delves into the nuances of the proposed payout, explaining how the estate was able to pay back more than 100% than the dollar value of the claims, why some creditors are being pitted against each other, and why it might get approved even “over the kicking and screaming” of some creditors. 
Braziel gives his insights into the the rapid formation of this plan, the controversial role of Sullivan and Cromwell, and the logistical challenges posed by what may end up being paper check payouts. 
 
Show highlights:

Why the plan that was filed this week is such big news
How it was never even possible for creditors to be made whole in crypto asset terms
How the majority of depositors actually had stablecoins on the FTX platform
Why there are “inter-creditor” disputes
What a “cramdown” is and why it’s significant in this case
Criticisms of the plan, and why larger investors, especially with crypto holdings, are having their gains socialized
Whether the FTX estate made mistakes by selling some of its positions before they 10x’ed
Why FTX didn’t reboot its platform 
What conflicts of interest might arise from law firm Sullivan and Cromwell
The tax implications for creditors who are non-US taxpayers
How the claims are going to be distributed
Whether the creditors will favor the proposal and the next steps

Render (RNDR) Surges 12% after Apple Highlights Octane Software | Coinspeaker



Many crypto traders believe that the iPhone maker’s brief acknowledgment of the software has propelled the recent surge in RNDR. 

Over the past week, RNDR, the digital asset linked to Render Network, a decentralized platform for GPU rendering, has been on a positive trend, experiencing a significant surge of over 40% by May 8, 2024. Continuing its upward trajectory, the token almost reached the $12 mark on Friday, marking a remarkable 12% increase. The surge in value coincides with a notable mention of Render by tech giant Apple in a promotional video shared on social media, showcasing the capabilities of its latest iPad with the M4 chip.
Apple’s Octane Recognition Boosts Render (RNDR) Token Price
The Render’s Octane software, mentioned in the video, is a powerful GPU rendering engine known for its ability to produce high-quality, photorealistic images. The software is supported by the Render network, enabling artists to efficiently scale their rendering work on-demand using GPU nodes.




Apple’s vice president of platform architecture, Tim Millet, acknowledged Octane during a four-minute keynote promoting the newly launched iPads.
In the video, Millet said that Apple users can leverage the significant increase in rendering power on the M4 by accessing nearly unlimited high-performance decentralized GPU compute power on Render using the Octane software.
Render confirmed that indeed, the Octane Apple mentioned in the video was its software when the project reposted the short clip on their X account on May 7.
Many crypto traders believe that the iPhone maker’s brief acknowledgment of the software has propelled the recent surge in RNDR.
Just last week, the token was trading at less than $10, with a market cap of around $4 billion. But with the recent surge, RNDR almost reached $12, settling at $11.33, according to CoinMarketCap data. Now, its market cap has climbed above $4 million.
RNDR Doesn’t Care
In a recent post on X,  a pseudonymous crypto trader, Mister Crypto, said that RNDR has been unfazed despite the current market downturn.
Mister Crypto compared Bitcoin’s (BTC) performance over the past week and said the crypto assets had been “falling, but RNDR just doesn’t care”. Meanwhile, after dipping below $62,000 and then bouncing back from last week’s drop to $57,000, Bitcoin has now recovered by over 6.62%. At the moment, the crypto asset is trading above $62,900.
CoinMarketCap data shows that Bitcoin currently boasts a total market capitalization of $1.2 trillion over the past day.

Can Bitcoin Reach $70K In the Next Few Months? New Altcoin Presales Poised for Massive Gains


																The question on everyone’s mind is whether Bitcoin can reach the impressive $70,000 mark in the coming months. While Bitcoin’s performance remains a focal point, the spotlight is also on new altcoin presales that are showing promising potential for massive gains. Among these, Dogeverse, Wiener AI, and Sealana are emerging as key players in the crypto market, each with unique selling points and exciting prospects.
Bitcoin’s Trajectory Aiming for $70K
Bitcoin, the pioneer cryptocurrency, has been a rollercoaster of value fluctuations. Despite recent uncertainties, many analysts and investors are optimistic about its potential to surge to $70,000 in the near future. Factors such as market sentiment, institutional adoption, and macroeconomic conditions play crucial roles in shaping Bitcoin’s trajectory.

It has been showing signs of a strong recovery, with some analysts suggesting that it could reach or even surpass $70,000 by the end of the year. This optimism is partly driven by the macroeconomic environment, including monetary policies and traditional finance (TradFi) investors increasingly allocating to Bitcoin ETFs. The approval of Bitcoin ETFs has been a significant positive driver, suggesting a more mainstream adoption and institutional interest in cryptocurrency.
Market analysts from Coinpedia and crypto.news have noted that Bitcoin has already brushed against the $70,000 mark and, supported by substantial investments from ‘whales’ (large-scale holders), could be poised for new highs.

Dogeverse – The Next Big Meme Coin
DOGEVERSE emerges as a promising player in the meme coin arena, drawing inspiration from the success of Dogecoin.  Its multi-chain feature—it has been implemented in Ethereum, Base, Polygon, Avalanche, and BNB Smart Chain, among other blockchain ecosystems—sets it out.

Dogeverse has already attracted a lot of attention, raising over $13 million in its initial coin offering (ICO) just a few weeks. This early demand suggests that investors have a great desire for the coin. Its appeal is increased by the possibility to stake Dogeverse holdings and receive staking rewards, which are now at an annual percentage yield (APY) of over 70%.
Seeing its promise, traders and cryptocurrency influencers like Crypto Boy and Jacob Bury have predicted that Dogeverse may yield significant profits—some even predicting a 100x increase in value.
>>>Buy Dogeverse now<<<
Wiener AI – Merging Meme and AI Trends
Wiener AI stands out for its innovative fusion of meme coin dynamics and artificial intelligence trends. This playful project mirrors the success of ScottyAI and offers daily staking rewards with an impressive APY for early investors. Operating on the ERC20 blockchain, Wiener AI aims to carve a niche in the competitive dog token space with its unique value proposition and forward-thinking approach.

The success of the project has been mostly attributed to its special fusion of cutting-edge technology and comedy. Meme coin fans have taken to WienerAI’s mascot, a funny cross between a dog and a sausage, and its AI-powered capabilities are rather useful to holders.
One noteworthy feature is the staking pool at WienerAI, which at the moment provides an annual percentage yield (APY) of more than 800%, much higher than industry norms. Investors have been encouraged to stake their tokens; over 68% of the tokens sold during the ICO were staked, which may lessen selling pressure after launch.
>>>Buy Weiner AI now<<<
Sealana – The Redneck Seal Making Waves
Sealana introduces a quirky concept with its depiction of a patriotic, overweight American redneck seal navigating the crypto world. Inspired by the impolite South Park character “Gamer Guy,” Sealana is a seal-themed degen who lived in his mother’s basement and ate chips and canned tuna instead of living in the water to seek meme coin fortune.

Despite market fluctuations, meme coins like Sealana demonstrate resilience, hinting at a potential surge in meme coin activity during the upcoming summer months. Sealana’s presale has already raised over $300,000, drawing interest from analysts and media outlets despite its lighthearted storyline.
Rumors indicating Sealana’s founders are the same group behind Slerf, a popular meme coin project that had a market capitalization of over $450 million in March, are adding to the frenzy. Though unproven, this relationship has given investors hope. Well-known people like Jacob Bury have suggested Sealana may provide substantial gains if it is listed on exchanges.
>>>Buy Sealana now<<<
Considerations for Investors
As the crypto market continues to evolve, investors are keenly watching the impact of global economic trends, regulatory developments, and technological breakthroughs. With the rise of DeFi and the increasing acceptance of cryptocurrencies as a legitimate asset class, the landscape is ripe for potential growth.
The cryptocurrency market remains highly volatile, with prices influenced by various factors including regulatory news, market sentiment, and technological advancements. While the potential for Bitcoin to reach $70,000 exists, investors should remain aware of the inherent risks and the possibility of sudden market shifts.
The potential for Bitcoin to reach $70,000 in the coming months is supported by a combination of factors including institutional investment, market sentiment, and technological advancements. At the same time, the burgeoning field of altcoins presents new opportunities for investors willing to explore these emerging assets.
Investors should consider the role of altcoins in diversifying their portfolios. Coins like DOGEVERSE, Wiener AI, and Sealana offer different value propositions and could represent a shift towards more niche and community-focused investments, which might lead to substantial returns.

FTX's Sam Bankman-Fried Talks About His New Life at Prison


In a rare glimpse behind the Metropolitan Detention Center (MDC) iron gates, Sam Bankman-Fried (SBF) shared the stark realities of prison life. The once high-flying CEO of crypto giant FTX spoke candidly in a recent interview.
Journalist William D. Cohan from Puck provided this intimate look. Bankman-Fried discussed his daily struggles and psychological resilience amid legal battles.
From Crypto Billionaire to Inmate: Bankman-Fried’s Life at MDC
Sam Bankman-Fried’s fall from grace was dramatic. He went from leading a multibillion-dollar empire to a federal prison cell. Celebrated as a financial tech industry wunderkind, he now faces a starkly different routine.
Their meeting took place in starkly utilitarian surroundings. These were far from the opulent settings Bankman-Fried knew.
He appeared physically diminished but mentally resilient. However, surprisingly, he has accepted his new circumstances.
Bankman-Fried’s day-to-day life is now dictated by the strict routines of prison life. The food, largely inedible to his vegan preferences, forces him to subsist on rice and beans from the commissary—now a currency among inmates.
Despite his notoriety, Bankman-Fried cautiously interacts with other prisoners. He navigates the complex social hierarchies of the prison with a blend of detachment and subtle engagement.

Interestingly, Dohan mentioned that Bankman-Fried doesn’t believe he committed any crimes.

“Only that he was the one responsible for putting FTX in a position where it was vulnerable to a bank run and the devious actions of its competitors, not unlike how both Bear Stearns and Lehman Brothers failed in 2008. […] Sam wondered, [why] was he prosecuted when no one at either Bear or Lehman faced criminal prosecution?” Dohan wrote.

According to Bankman-Fried’s theory, he is in prison not for commingling FTX’s and Alameda’s assets. He sees himself as an innocent guy who didn’t get to negotiate with federal prosecutors. Bankman-Fried thinks the prosecutors just presented him with his indictment, then told him to accept it, plead guilty, or go to trial and fight.

Despite the gravity of his situation, Bankman-Fried showed his former analytical acumen. He discussed the prison economy with hints of his old entrepreneurial spirit.
The conversation also touched on darker themes. Bankman-Fried talked further about his isolation and the tangible sense of danger. Nonetheless, he has remained physically unharmed so far.

Inside Bankman-Fried’s Legal Battle and FTX’s Future
The legal battles ahead are a central theme in Bankman-Fried’s life. He is actively preparing for his appeal.
He works closely with his legal team to challenge the convictions leading to his lengthy sentence. BeInCrypto previously reported that Bankman-Fried filed a notice of appeal in April.
On March 28, 2024, Judge Lewis Kaplan sentenced Bankman-Fried to 25 years. Kaplan cited Bankman-Fried’s false testimonies and witness tampering attempts. He also ordered Bankman-Fried to a low or medium-security prison near his parents in California.
In a separate development, FTX and its associated debtors filed an updated Plan of Reorganization. They filed it with the United States Bankruptcy Court in Delaware.

The strategy shows FTX has secured $14.5 to $16.3 billion for repayment. This figure comes from liquidating diverse assets, including those controlled by global entities involved in the proceedings. The strategy aims to consolidate FTX’s position and simplify the repayment process.

However, many are disappointed with FTX’s updated plan. This is due to the bankruptcy estate decision to freeze the value of customer crypto assets in November 2022.

Jack Dorsey criticizes Bluesky for straying from decentralized ethos - Crypto Briefing




There’s always one or more reasons behind a company board member’s departure. With Jack Dorsey and Bluesky, it’s all about direction. Speaking with Pirates Wires this week, Bluesky’s inventor said the company is straying from its original decentralized ethos and resembling a conventional social media app, the type of app he intended to avoid at the beginning.“This is literally repeating all the mistakes we made as a company. This is not a protocol that’s truly decentralized. It’s another app. It’s another app that’s just kind of following in Twitter’s footsteps, but for a different part of the population,” Dorsey stated.Dorsey’s initial vision for Bluesky was to create a social media protocol that could overcome the challenges faced by centralized platforms, such as those he encountered at Twitter (now X). He expected that Bluesky would support free speech and not be beholden to the constraints of a publicly traded company dependent on advertising revenue.However, as Bluesky developed, it began incorporating more traditional corporate elements, including forming a board and seeking venture capital funding. For a person deeply committed to decentralization, it’s a clear departure from his original goals for the project.“Everything we wanted around decentralization, everything we wanted in terms of an [open-source] protocol, suddenly became a company with VCs and a board. That’s not what I wanted, that’s not what I intended to help create,” Dorsey remarked.According to him, this shift, combined with a growing emphasis on app development and moderation tools, moved Bluesky away from being a truly decentralized protocol.Commenting on the public perception of Bluesky as “anti-Twitter,” Dorsey said it was not the foundational intention. Bluesky was meant to be a neutral protocol rather than a direct competitor.Dorsey also noted the limitations of the advertising-based revenue model for social media platforms, which he believes compromises content policies and platform governance. He suggests alternative revenue streams, such as subscriptions and commerce, could provide a more sustainable and less compromising approach.Earlier this week, the team behind Bluesky announced that Dorsey was no longer on the board of directors. At the time, neither Dorsey nor Bluesky commented publicly on the departure.After leaving Bluesky, Dorsey has turned his attention to Nostr, a protocol he considers a more accurate reflection of his decentralized social media aspirations, operating without a central authority or corporate structure.

Is DogWifHat Dead? Crypto Expert Tweets $1 Price Target, New Meme Coin WienerAI Raises $1.4 Million

One influential trader believes DogWifHat will crash soon. 
                        A top crypto influencer on X believes the popular Solana meme coin DogWifHat ($WIF) could tumble all the way down to a dollar from its current price of $3.17. In a recent tweet, Bluntz Capital (@Bluntz_Capital) cautioned, “price action on this bounce over the last 3 weeks has been slow, overlapping, and corrective looking.” Bluntz further argues that WIF’s current gains could be a brief wobble before the token crashes and bottoms out at a dollar. Since Bluntz joined the ByBit copy trading platform a year ago, he has been ranked as one of the top influencers, meaning he has consistently made money for his followers.Still, DogWifHat’s current price performance does not reflect a decline.WIF is up 12% in the last 24 hours and 15% in the last week. It’s moving broadly in line with the rest of the market, where most leading projects are up today.The project with the second largest gains among the top five meme coins by market capitalization is Pepe Coin.PEPE rose 6.8% to change hands at $0.05862 as of this writing. It is also up 13% in the last seven days. Both meme coins outdid market leaders Bitcoin ($BTC) and Ethereum ($ETH). Bitcoin, the world’s largest cryptocurrency, grew 3.5% overnight to trade at $63,176, while Ethereum added 2.2% to hit $3,037.Like the market leaders, WIF rallied throughout March. However, it diverged a little at the end when the meme coin continued rallying strongly and actually rose to set a new all-time high of $4.83 on March 31. Today’s price represents a 34.2% decline since then. Source: TradingViewDogWifHat currently has a Relative Strength Index (RSI) of 57. This has been climbing since midweek, indicating buying momentum. If it doesn’t cool off, investors may well see the beginning of the correction described by Bluntz. As DogWifHat Wobbles, Crypto’s First Trading Companion, WienerAI, Raises $1.4 Million.
Bluntz’s prediction may prove to be prophetic for WIF holders in the mid-term. Should the currency rebound from a dollar, which he implies, then there will be no damage done. However, meme coins highlight the inherently volatile nature of crypto.A new generation of meme coins is cropping up though which bring bundles of utility along with laughs.One of the finest representatives of this new generation of coins is WienerAI. $WAI is a brand new meme token and AI companion that may yield some potentially eye-watering rallies once word gets out about its core offering.The presale is not even a month old and it has already quietly taken in $1.4 million.Touted as a “Revolutionary AI Trading partner”, WienerAI ($WAI) is a digital companion that gives its owners user-friendly AI-enhanced trading advice, seamless swap functionality and zero fees.The WienerAI smart contract was audited by Coinsult, a blockchain security platform that conducts security checks on various crypto and blockchain platforms. Around 20% of $WAI’s supply is for staking. WienerAI’s website encourages buyers to stake during the presale, in order to take advantage of the lucrative yield, which is currently 660% APY. Stay on top of WienerAI news over on X and Telegram. Join the presale now over on the WienerAI website.

                        Crypto exchange Kraken urged the US court to dismiss the SEC claims against it to avoid a “significant reordering” of the US financial regulatory structure.In November 2023, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) initiated a lawsuit against Kraken. The SEC, alleging it had been operating an unregistered securities trading platform.This suit came months after settling charges over Kraken’s former staking service.In February 2024, Kraken filed to dismiss the lawsuit, contending that it relied solely on a registration-based argument regarding Kraken’s operation as an unlicensed securities entity.Kraken argued that cryptocurrencies listed as SEC-compliant should be treated like commodities and not securities.However, now Kraken has escalated its position, urging the court to dismiss the claims to avoid a “significant reordering” of the US financial regulatory structure, according to court filings submitted in the Northern District of California on Thursday.The SEC filed an opposition to Kraken’s motion to dismiss, asserting that its enforcement action falls within its congressionally granted authority. They emphasize its role in enforcing registration requirements for securities intermediaries.“In applying the Howey test in its determination that Kraken must register, the SEC is simply following its Congressional mandate.”They also stated that it’s not overstepping its powers and doesn’t need to “enact bespoke laws to each new technology that emerges.”Kraken’s response to the SEC’s motion centers on interpreting the SEC’s jurisdiction through the Howey test.This assesses whether an investment qualifies as a security based on 4 main criteria: an investment of money, expectation of profits, common enterprise, and reliance on the efforts of others. Kraken’s lawyers argued against:“The SEC cannot satisfy Howey’s additional requirements that there be investments of money in a common enterprise with a reasonable expectation of profits based on the efforts of others.”According to Kraken, the SEC’s interpretation would unnecessarily broaden its jurisdiction beyond what was intended, potentially drastically changing the financial regulatory environment. They said:“This would gut Howey by significantly expanding the SEC’s jurisdiction to a host of investment activities that were never delegated to the agency. Such a significant reordering of the US’s financial regulatory structure should be debated in Congress, not in the courts.”SEC in Question for Hammering Crypto
Kraken is just one of many leading companies within the crypto space battling with the SEC. Coinbase, Uniswap, Metamask, and Robinhood have also received regulatory action.Despite making no progress on individual cases, the SEC continues to challenge major players in the space.In 2023, like Kraken, Coinbase locked into a battle with the SEC after the federal agency accused the crypto exchange of selling unregistered securities.Legal counsel for Coinbase had requested that DC Judge Katherine Polk Failla determine whether or not the matter falls outside of the agency’s delegated authority.During a January hearing, Failla pushed back against Coinbase’s request to restrict the SEC’s regulatory scope.However, Judge Failla placed the case on hold questioning the overreach of the SEC in their claims. She stated:“I worry that I would be doing exactly the thing you’re alleging the Commission is doing here, which is to take power that I don’t have to stop activity I shouldn’t be stopping.”Crypto Community Stands With Kraken in the Fight Against the SEC
The continued assault on the crypto space has prompted many figures to speak out, citing the SEC’s anti-crypto agenda to be an attempt to push crypto out of the US.Ethereum Co-founder Joseph Lubin criticized the SEC’s approach, alleging that instead of fostering open discourse and providing clear regulatory guidelines, the SEC has opted for strategic enforcement actions.This has caused unease within the cryptocurrency industry amidst such regulatory uncertainty,  causing US investors have become hesitant to enter the space. Lubin commented:“The SEC probably doesn’t want to see a wave of innovation that will really transform the landscape.”In February 2024, the Crypto and Financial Technology Advocacy Group (CFAT), which includes prominent figures like Paradigm, Coinbase, and Ledger, filed a lawsuit against the SEC.This came under claims that “The SEC’s novel attempt to extend its regulatory power to virtually all digital assets reach far beyond the scope of its statutory authority.”CFAT also argued that SEC’s ruling-by-enforcement approach has hindered crypto’s innovation. They claim the SEC has:“Left this trillion-dollar industry in an unsustainable state of uncertainty, subject to the arbitrary enforcement whims of an agency with an overly broad view of its own authority.”Hence, Kraken’s position on the matter urged a dismissal. For the SEC to continue, it must revaluate the current US legal framework. Unless they stop overreaching their authority.

ANI Pharmaceuticals Beats Expectations with $137.4 Million in Q1 Revenues - Tokenist


					
Neither the author, Tim Fries, nor this website, The Tokenist, provide financial advice. Please consult our website policy prior to making financial decisions.



ANI Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (NASDAQ: ANIP) has set a new benchmark in its financial performance for the first quarter of 2024, demonstrating significant growth across all business segments. The company reported record quarterly net revenues of $137.4 million, marking a year-over-year increase of 28.7%. This growth was propelled by a notable performance in the Rare Disease business, which saw net revenues soar to $36.9 million, a staggering 126.2% increase from the previous year. Such robust growth underscores the increasing market penetration and expansion of the overall ACTH market, particularly for their lead Rare Disease asset, Cortrophin Gel.



The adjusted non-GAAP EBITDA reached a record $37.6 million, alongside an adjusted non-GAAP diluted EPS of $1.21. These figures not only reflect the company’s operational excellence and successful new product launches but also highlight the strategic investments made to expand awareness and utilization of Cortrophin Gel in new specialties. The company’s ability to maintain momentum in its Generics, Established Brands, and Other segment, achieving a double-digit increase in Generics revenue, further emphasizes its operational strength and market agility.



ANI Pharmaceuticals Surpasses Q1 Expectations with $1.21 EPS and $137.4 Million in Revenues



Comparing ANI’s current performance against expectations reveals a narrative of significant overachievement. Analysts had projected an EPS of $0.98 and revenue expectations of $125.35 million for the quarter. ANI’s reported EPS of $1.21 and revenues of $137.4 million comfortably surpassed these forecasts, indicating a robust financial health and operational efficiency exceeding market expectations. This outperformance is particularly noteworthy in the context of the Rare Disease segment, where Cortrophin Gel’s revenue of $36.9 million far exceeded expectations, driven by increased prescription demand across core and new specialties. The company’s Generics, Established Brands, and Other segment also outperformed, with revenue growth of 11.1% year-over-year, further contributing to the company’s overall success.





ANI Reiterates Guidance for Full Year 2024, Expects Non GAAP EPS Between $4.26 to $4.67



Looking ahead, ANI has reiterated its guidance for the full year 2024, projecting net revenues in the range of $520 million to $542 million and adjusted non-GAAP EBITDA between $135 million and $145 million. The adjusted non-GAAP earnings per share are expected to be between $4.26 and $4.67. This guidance includes anticipated net revenues from Cortrophin Gel ranging from $170 million to $180 million, which would represent a year-over-year growth of 52% to 61%. Such projections reflect the company’s confidence in its strategic initiatives and the continued growth trajectory of its Rare Disease business. ANI’s commitment to enhancing its generics business, coupled with the strategic focus on its Rare Disease segment, positions the company well for sustainable growth and long-term value creation for its stakeholders.

Bitcoin's 'Kimchi Premium' Shrinks Amidst South Korea's Fading Crypto Fervor


							

The decline in South Korea’s Kimchi Premium signals shifting sentiments in the country’s crypto market.



Limited local supply exacerbates price gaps, contributing to fluctuations in the Kimchi Premium.



Decreased trading volumes on top South Korean exchanges reflect subdued market activity amidst global events.




The Kimchi Premium, often regarded as a gauge of South Korea’s interest in cryptocurrencies, has been consistently decreasing, hitting 1.54% on a recent Friday afternoon in Asia. This metric reflects the variance in Bitcoin prices between South Korea and other global markets and has experienced a notable decline since mid-April, signaling a notable change in the country’s cryptocurrency scene.



This decline in the Kimchi Premium can be attributed to various factors influencing South Korea’s crypto market. One key element is the restrictive nature of the market itself, which limits foreign investors’ access. Local investors engaging in arbitrage face potential legal repercussions under the Foreign Exchange Transactions Act if they buy large volumes of crypto from foreign exchanges.



Moreover, South Korea’s limited local supply of cryptocurrencies exacerbates price discrepancies. During periods of heightened demand, such as observed in March when the premium reached its peak at 11.44%, the gap widens due to an imbalance between the supply and demand of Bitcoin.



A notable trend accompanying the decrease in the Kimchi Premium is the reduced trading volumes on South Korea’s top crypto exchanges, including Upbit, Bithumb, Coinone, Korbit, and Gopax. These exchanges, which dominate the local market, collectively recorded a trading volume of $2 billion in the past 24 hours, significantly lower than the nearly $18 billion reported on March 6, according to CoinGecko data.









Several factors may have contributed to the dampened enthusiasm for cryptocurrencies in South Korea. Events such as the conflict in the Middle East and continued net outflows in U.S. spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) could have influenced investor sentiment. 



Additionally, the lack of significant events highlighting Bitcoin’s value since the halving occurred last month may have contributed to subdued market activity. With Bitcoin priced at $62,974.01, marking a 3.24% increase in the last 24 hours. The cryptocurrency’s trading volume over this period stands at $25,433,969,068, showcasing robust market activity within the day.

Indian Customers Can Once Again Access Binance: Reports


Binance, the world’s largest crypto exchange, is reportedly poised to continue its operations after agreeing to pay India’s Financial Intelligence Unit (FIU-IND) a fine. 
This decision is a key part of a broader compliance drive by international exchanges with Indian regulations.
Binance Joins KuCoin to Become Compliant Crypto Exchange in India
Binance and KuCoin achieved a milestone by becoming the first offshore crypto-related entities to register with FIU-IND. This step is indeed crucial in a sector where Indian authorities demand compliance with strict anti-money laundering (AML) laws.
The need for registration arose after a challenging period in December 2023, when FIU-IND issued show-cause notices to nine offshore crypto exchanges. This also included industry leaders like Binance and Kraken. 

Read more: The State of Crypto Regulation in India
With Apple removing non-compliant platforms from its App Store and the IT Ministry blocking their websites, users were urged to transfer their assets to FIU-registered Indian exchanges. These notices stemmed from the exchanges operating without adhering to the Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA) of 2002, which demands stringent record-keeping and reporting standards.
Finally, following the footsteps of KuCoin, which has resumed operations after settling a $41,000 penalty, Binance might make a similar move. 

“Binance is registered but the compliance proceedings are not completed because the amount of penalty has to be decided by me and that hearing is still going on,” Vivek Aggarwal, head of FIU-IND said.


Sumit Gupta, the co-founder of the Indian crypto exchange – CoinDCX, welcomed Binance and KuCoin to the Indian market. In an interview with BeInCrypto, Gupta expressed enthusiasm about the developments. 

“A compliant crypto ecosystem, comprising FIU-compliant players, not only benefits all stakeholders but also safeguards against bad actors. These developments mark significant progress towards ensuring that crypto exchanges operate in accordance with regulations like the Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA), thus laying the foundation for a more compliant ecosystem,” Gupta told BeInCrypto.

Balaji Srihari, the Business Head at CoinSwitch, also echoes these sentiments.


“It is commendable to see major global exchanges such as Binance and KuCoin leading by example and adhering to FIU standards. These norms establish a systematic approach to monitoring transactions and provide a designated channel for reporting suspicious activities,” Srihari told BeInCrypto.

As Binance edges towards full compliance, its customers will likely incur financial obligations. This includes a 1% tax deduction at source (TDS). Introduced in 2022, a 1% TDS on crypto trading aims to increase transparency.

Moreover, traders face a 30% capital gains tax on profits, which has been a contentious issue within the crypto community. However, these regulatory measures are part of a broader effort by the Indian government to regulate the crypto market. The goal is to align with global standards while protecting investor interests.

Crypto Nonprofit Launches PAC to Support Pro-Crypto Politicians in 2024 Elections - Benzinga

A cryptocurrency nonprofit has launched a political action committee (PAC) with the intent to support crypto-friendly politicians in the 2024 House and Senate elections.What Happened: “Stand With Crypto,” a cryptocurrency nonprofit, has launched a PAC to raise funds from its 440,000 members to support a bipartisan group of candidates, Reuters reported on Wednesday. This move is part of a broader effort by the crypto industry to elect politicians who support crypto and blockchain.This involvement comes at a time when the industry is under scrutiny, especially after FTX founder Sam Bankman-Fried was found guilty of stealing from customers.Unlike super PACs, Stand With Crypto’s PAC is established to collect funds for candidates or political causes and cannot receive donations of unlimited size or coordinate directly with campaigns.See Also: Tom Brady Roasted For Cryptocurrency Investment In Netflix Special: ‘Tom, How Did You Fall For That? Even Gronk Was Like—Me Know That’s Not Real Money’“The goal is to endorse candidates and support candidates that are protecting the rights of our advocates of Stand With Crypto throughout November,” said Nick Carr, chief strategist at Stand With Crypto. Why It Matters: Other crypto super PACs such as Fairshake, Defend American Jobs, and Protect Progress have already raised over $110 million this election cycle, according to Federal Election Commission records. The involvement of crypto in politics is not new. Earlier this year, the Fairshake PAC received a significant financial boost from the Winklevoss twins, founders of the Gemini crypto exchange, as part of their larger fundraising efforts.Former U.S. President Donald Trump has also publicly endorsed cryptocurrency, declaring it a significant election issue, contrasting with President Joe Biden‘s perceived unfamiliarity with the crypto world. This endorsement has led to a surge in the MAGA Coin, a cryptocurrency themed around Trump.Read Next: Here’s How Much $1,000 Invested In Dogecoin Would be Worth If You Invested When Elon Musk First Tweeted About DOGEImage by Dall-E

Is China the Next Step for Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs? Much Talked About BTC-ETH Step from the Giant Company! - Bitcoin Sistemi


Hong Kong, which took a big step after the USA in spot ETFs, recently launched spot Bitcoin Ethereum ETFs.
Hong Kong ETFs failed to perform as expected, but it is claimed that there is potential for companies to enter China through ETFs.


At this point, Harvest Global Investments, a leading Chinese fund house and Hong Kong's first spot ETF issuer, has set its sights on mainland China.
Speaking at the Bitcoin Asia conference in Hong Kong, Harvest CEO Han Tongli announced that his company plans to offer direct access to Bitcoin and Ethereum products to investors in China through its ETF Connect program.





He said that if market conditions are suitable, they will apply for BTC and ETH ETFs to be included in the connect program within the next two years.

“We have some plans for Bitcoin and Etheruem ETFs to reach investors in China. If we, as Harvest Global, manage to get spot BTC-ETH ETFs into the Stock Connect program, a new investment path will be opened for investors in mainland China.
Since the regulatory environment on the mainland is quite uncertain, the Stock Connect program could be a pioneer in regulating cryptocurrency investments, especially Bitcoin and Ethereum. “

Kraken v. SEC: What's New in Legal Saga?

In the ongoing legal saga between Kraken and the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), the crypto exchange has launched a salvo with a new filing that argues the agency’s case was not worded correctly.Kraken filed a response on Thursday to the SEC's April letter regarding the company's motion to dismiss the case. The exchange argues that the SEC's argument lacked precision, as it failed to specify any investment contracts tradable on Kraken. Instead of using the terms "investment contract" and "enterprise," the SEC opted for phrases like "investment concept" and "ecosystem" throughout its argument, according to Kraken's filing.The SEC's stance, as outlined in its April filing, defends its choice of language by stating that the scope of the law extends beyond conventional interpretations. This stance was backed by case law, the SEC argued.Last November, the SEC accused Kraken of operating as an unregistered broker, dealer, exchange and clearing agency. The SEC's complaint also alleges that Kraken has been unlawfully facilitating the buying and selling of crypto asset securities since at least September 2018, earning hundreds of millions of dollars in the process. Kraken, under its parent company Payward Inc., had previously settled charges brought by the SEC against its staking business in February 2023.As the case progresses, the crypto community watches with bated breath. Kraken's challenge to the SEC's wording is more than a legal argument; it is a stand against what the exchange views as an overextension of regulatory power.The outcome of the Kraken case could have significant implications for how crypto exchanges operate and how digital assets are classified and regulated in the United States going forward.

Bitcoin's price set to move higher if macro outlook remains supportive: Grayscale report - Crypto Briefing




Bitcoin’s price and the overall crypto market capitalization have the potential to “move higher” through the remainder of the year as long as the macroeconomic outlook remains broadly supportive, according to Grayscale’s report published on Thursday.Bitcoin’s price dropped 15% in April, and the total crypto market cap also decreased slightly. However, Bitcoin and Ethereum have still outperformed the broader crypto sector indexes.According to the report, we may be in the “seventh-inning stretch” of Bitcoin’s bull market cycle, with a pause in the rally seeming appropriate given the shift in Federal Reserve (Fed) monetary policy expectations.Analysts suggested that the market was less confident about the likelihood of Fed rate cuts this year with stubborn inflation and strong US growth. This has bolstered the US dollar and pressured Bitcoin prices.However, the US economy is poised for a soft landing, Grayscale’s report stated. Analysts point to Fed officials hinting at future rate cuts and the November elections, which are not expected to increase fiscal discipline.“The macro outlook still seems supportive: the US economy is on track for a soft landing, Fed officials are signaling that rate cuts will eventually be appropriate, and the November elections seem unlikely to result in more fiscal discipline,” analysts stated.On the technical front, Bitcoin’s valuation metrics, such as the MVRV ratio, are currently below the peaks of previous cycles, indicating room for growth.“As long as the macro outlook remains broadly unchanged from here, Grayscale Research believes that Bitcoin’s price and total crypto market capitalization can move higher again through the balance of the year,” analysts noted.Neel Kashkari, one of the Fed’s most hawkish members, said on Tuesday that holding interest rates at current levels for a longer period than anticipated is a much more likely scenario than raising them further. However, he added that the Fed could cut rates if they observe a rise in unemployment.Kashkari said he previously expected there might be room to cut interest rates twice in 2024. However, he is now considering adjusting that expectation, potentially reducing the number of cuts to one or even none.“I would need to see multiple positive inflation readings suggesting that the disinflation process is on track,” Kashkari stated.Grayscale’s report also touches on the potential implications of a second Trump administration for the US Dollar and Bitcoin, referring to Standard Chartered’s prediction that Bitcoin may gain from a Trump election victory.Despite the challenging macro backdrop, there were positive developments within the crypto markets, such as the Bitcoin halving. The halving significantly reduced the network’s new issuance rate and has brought Bitcoin’s inflation rate below that of gold’s supply inflation.In addition, rising activity on the Ethereum network and progress on stablecoin legislation in the US were notable events.Analysts shared that “Senators Lummis and Gillibrand proposed a bipartisan bill outlining a framework for stablecoin legislation. The proposal involved a requirement for stablecoin issuers to hold one-to-one reserves, consumer safeguards such as FDIC involvement in the event of failures, and an outright ban on algorithmic stablecoins.”Stablecoin market capitalization is growing, with USDC gaining market share on Tether. Regulatory clarity on stablecoins could be a positive development for the industry, analysts suggest.“In our view, US regulatory clarity on the status of stablecoins on public blockchains would be an important step forward for payments use cases. In addition to progress on legislation, the payments processing firm Stripe announced that it would allow its customers to send USDC stablecoin payments on Ethereum, Solana, and Polygon—another positive sign for the development of these networks,” analysts added.

Giant Lending Platform BlockFi Announces That Its Website Will Be Closed! User Moved Their Funds to This Cryptocurrency Exchange! - Bitcoin Sistemi

BlockFi, a leading centralized lending platform, announced this month that it plans to shut down its web platform and called for alternative measures to be implemented to ensure uninterrupted access to user funds.
BlockFi Announces Shutdown of Web Platform, Facilitates Cryptocurrency Withdrawals via Coinbase
To facilitate a seamless transition for its customers, BlockFi announced a partnership with cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase, allowing eligible users to access cryptocurrency withdrawals through the Coinbase platform.


The decision to work with Coinbase as a distribution partner comes as BlockFi prepares to shut down its web platform, which serves as a gateway for users to manage their crypto assets.
With the upcoming closure, BlockFi aims to provide continuity in cryptocurrency withdrawals for its customers, especially those with BlockFi Interest Accounts (BIA), Personal Loans and Private Client accounts.





“BlockFi is pleased to announce that we have appointed Coinbase as our distribution partner to ensure the continuity of cryptocurrency withdrawals available to our eligible BlockFi Interest Account (BIA), Personal Loan and Private Clients,” the firm said in a recent announcement.
According to BlockFi, customers who missed the April 28 withdrawal deadline and the May 10 verification deadline still have the opportunity to access their assets through a verified Coinbase account.



This strategic collaboration ensures that affected clients maintain control over their crypto assets without immediate conversion to cash.
However, for customers who are eligible to withdraw cryptocurrency but cannot meet the specified deadlines and do not have a verified Coinbase account, their assets will be converted to cash and distributed as stated in the plan.





The decision to shut down the web platform follows a series of challenges faced by BlockFi, including a suspension of customer withdrawals in November 2022 and subsequent filing for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection.

How the NFT Transparent Marketplace Wins Over Game Skin Markets | Cryptopolitan

Today’s climate seems favorable to the growth of blockchain-based digital items known as NFT. At its peak, the digital item market reached sales of around $17B, while mainstream digital items drew in around $50B. Owning digital items is not unusual at all, even for the biggest NFT skeptics. The global in-game item industry grows by leaps every year. By 2025, an estimated $77B may be spent on in-game purchases, though there are even higher estimates for the consumption of digital items. The virtual goods market may reach $294B by the decade’s end, with 20% yearly growth. While some of that spending will be on cosmetic digital items, technological growth may add new digital item categories and economic models. Will the Real Digital Ownership Become the NFT Selling Point?In gross terms and monetary size, the digital market for mainstream games seems to be winning. However, players have always faced disaster with digital items held on a game server. Players have reported disasters like stolen skins, or digital items that do not work in a new game version. Not only did the skin market expand to $50B annually in the past few years, but skins are now key to adding game variety and achieving a personalized look. Safe, guaranteed ownership is, therefore, key to securing valuable items. The biggest challenge for supporters of NFT technology is to dispel the image that digital items are primarily sold for profit instead of serving as a layer of security for ownership. So far, only a few mainstream gaming studios have introduced NFT, and those were only optional or experimental. NFT Wins with More Transparent MarketplaceThe informal market for skins in mainstream games developed so fast that there is no reliable venue for changing ownership. The skin-selling market is informal, unregulated, and has no transparency. All sites for reselling set their terms, and often, price settlement is informal, with no arbitration or recourse. Compared to informal gaming skin reselling, the NFT market is extremely transparent and well-organized. Each NFT comes with a clear history of ownership transfers. Additionally, price information is easily gathered. All items in a collection are known and searchable, and there is information on the highest and lowest price, rarity, and potential demand.Mainstream Markets Copy NFT Trading ModelThe boom of NFT trading in 2021 and 2022 created some good practices in trading digital items. Projects like White Market have brought together the best of both worlds. The market specializes in swapping Counter Strike 2 skins, modeling scarcity, price and demand similar to OpenSea. White Market also uses WhiteBit Codes as a tool to pay with digital currency. Skin owners can use USDT to buy or receive funds. The opposite is also happening—the Avalanche-based game Shrapnel allows direct card purchases of its SHRAP in-game token, opening up to a large pool of players not willing to pay in crypto.Can Game Items Be Tokenized Again?There is hardly a need for game companies to decide on a true ownership standard for their in-game items. Instead, blockchain startups are simply adding a new layer of security. Metazero is one of those projects, which aims to tokenize already existing digital assets. Users with existing Steam accounts can secure all their skins, weapons or items through Metazero. This way, their items will have their value represented on the blockchain. Additionally, CS2 game items can be tokenized as NFT and traded again for their rarity, in a form of real-world asset (RWA) tokenization.Some game companies have been skeptical and have tried to protect their items from tokenization. One such case was Mojang’s Minecraft, which banned the creation of NFT based on its game images, skins, land or other items. This led to the dissolution of NFT Worlds, one of the most successful collections based on land plots on a Minecraft server. Others, like Counter Strike: Global Offensive, have embraced a model similar to NFT, assigning transparent rarity levels to their weapon skins. With rarity to motivate resellers, those skins command peak values on resale markets.Who is the winner? In 2024, the NFT market and game skin industry are either going for a collision or partnership. The technology ensures a fair, transparent market, while tapping rarity, visual appeal, and player preferences.

Magic Eden Overtakes Blur, Fueled by Bitcoin Ecosystem Growth


Magic Eden has surpassed Blur to become the leading NFT marketplace in terms of trading volume, signaling a significant shift in the dynamic 
NFT landscape. This highlights Magic Eden‘s growing influence and traders’ and collectors’ evolving preferences.
Magic Eden Exceeds Blur’s NFT Volume
This development demonstrates Magic Eden’s success and underscores the increasing importance of the Bitcoin ecosystem.
According to DappRadar’s April 2024 Dapp Industry Report, Magic Eden’s trading volume exceeded Blur’s by $108 million. Runestone, a significant Bitcoin Ordinals inscription, has played a crucial role. 

“Magic Eden, now allowing the trading of Bitcoin Ordinals, holds the top spot, with Bitcoin Ordinals trading accounting for 70% of the marketplace’s total volume. This underscores their growing popularity,” DappRadar noted.


By leveraging Bitcoin’s UTXO model to minimize blockchain data, potentially reducing transaction fees compared to traditional Ordinals, Runestone has become the NFT collection with the highest trading volume in April. 
It surpassed the iconic Bored Ape Yacht Club. This underscores Bitcoin collections’ impact on the NFT market, a trend likely to continue.

Bitcoin collections have witnessed a 32% increase in trading volume, reaching an impressive $675 million this month. This surge has propelled Bitcoin to become the blockchain with the highest trading volume, outpacing the industry stalwart Ethereum.
Magic Eden’s ascent stems from its strategic embrace of the Bitcoin ecosystem and comprehensive platform features. Low transaction fees, a user-friendly interface supporting multiple blockchains, and continuous platform enhancements have enabled Magic Eden to capture and sustain a substantial market share.
While Magic Eden’s rise is remarkable, the broader NFT market has experienced a 13% decline in total trading volume to $1.35 billion in April, although sales increased by 20%. This dichotomy results from Runestone’s rising popularity and the overall surge in Bitcoin collections.

Despite the overall market downturn, Bitcoin collections have emerged as resilient. Four of the top eight collections in sales volume were Bitcoin-based, collectively recording $423 million in sales. 
In contrast, Ethereum collections like CryptoPunks and Bored Ape Yacht Club recorded relatively low sales volumes of $26 million and $25 million, respectively.

What is Ethereum?
Founded in 2013 by Vitalik Buterin, Ethereum serves as a distributed blockchain computing platform designed for the execution of smart contracts and decentralized applications (DApps). The network enables users to create and innovate extensively with smart contracts, catalyzing the emergence of various assets and industries such as decentralized finance (DeFi), non-fungible tokens (NFTs), decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs), Web3 and beyond. At its core, Ethereum features an execution engine tailored for smart contract processing, known as the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM). In addition, Ethereum employs a proof-of-stake (PoS) consensus mechanism, which enhances its scalability and sustainability.ETH Price Performance and Ethereum On-Chain Data Analysis 
April saw a period of volatility for Ether (ETH). On April 8, the ETH price reached $3,723, but plunged 30% between April 9 and April 13, reaching a 50-day low of $2,863. While there was a partial recovery on April 14, a failed attempt to break the $3,200 resistance level indicated further weakness. ETH/USD daily chart. Source: TradingViewOn April 23, the ETH price rose above $3,200, potentially fueled by increased demand for Ethereum DApps. This was further supported by a surge in the network’s total value locked (TVL) reaching its highest level since July 2022 ($58 billion on April 12 and $56,9 billion on April 28), indicating continued activity within the DeFi space.Ethereum’s TVL has been climbing year-to-date. Source: ArtemisHowever, the lack of clarity regarding the approval of spot Ethereum ETFs in the U.S., especially the upcoming SEC decision on VanEck’s proposal, could dampen investor interest. At the end of the month, the ETH price dropped again, reaching $3,000.Additional data also reveals a decline in Ethereum’s network activity (in specific metrics) over the last month (especially compared to March). Daily active addresses on Ethereum dropped from 534k addresses on March 20 to 379k addresses on April 24, but this number increased at the end of the month and reached 474k on April 30. Ethereum also witnessed a decline in daily transactions in April – from 1.4 million on March 19 to 1.1 million on April 27.Number of active addresses on Ethereum. Source: ArtemisEthereum-based crypto investment products experienced negative outflows in April which saw $38 million, according to an April 29 report by CoinShares. This stands in contrast to most other altcoins like Solana, Litecoin, and Chainlink, which enjoyed positive inflows of $4 million, $3 million, and $2.8 million respectively during the same period. Weekly crypto flows by asset. Source: CoinSharesAt the same time, Ethereum’s on-exchange supply also continued to decline throughout April, at a faster rate than Bitcoin. This indicates a decreasing supply of Ethereum available for trading, suggesting a potential shortage. This behavior aligns with the trend of investors holding Ethereum for longer periods, incorporating it into their long-term portfolios. Other indicators, such as the high staking ratio, further support this hypothesis.In April, gas fees on the Ethereum network dropped to their lowest level in six months following the Dencun upgrade on Ethereum on March 13. This drop in gas fees could be a harbinger of an upcoming rally for altcoins, according to analysts at crypto data platform Santiment. Santiment’s data, shared in an X post on April 28, shows that the average cost of an Ethereum transaction fell as low as $1.12 on April 27.Spot Ether ETFs Face Regulatory Uncertainty
The future of spot Ether exchange-traded funds (ETFs) in the US remains shrouded in uncertainty. Over the past two months, Ether has significantly underperformed Bitcoin. This trend intensified in April after Jan van Eck, Chief Investment Officer of VanEck, expressed concerns about possible rejections of US spot Ether ETF applications in May. This news came on top of the SEC’s inaction on the seven pending spot Ether ETF applications, further dampening investor sentiment. In April, the SEC announced a delay in its decision on Franklin Templeton’s proposed spot Ether ETF, extending the deadline to June 11, 2024. The SEC also delayed a similar proposal for the Grayscale Ethereum Trust. Other issuers that have filed applications for Ether ETFs include BlackRock, 21Shares with Ark, Fidelity and Invesco, as well as Galaxy and Hashdex.While Bitcoin enjoyed a relatively smooth path to spot ETF approval in January, the outlook for spot Ethereum ETFs seems less certain.In March, Bloomberg ETF analyst Eric Balchunas estimated a significantly lower chance (around 35%) for SEC approval of a spot Ether ETF in May, effectively moving the needle of the ETH price as well. This pessimism stems from the SEC’s noticeably less engaged approach compared to the Bitcoin ETF application process. Additionally, SEC Chair Gary Gensler’s refusal to clarify whether Ether is considered a security in an April 18 hearing on oversight of the SEC adds another layer of uncertainty to the decision-making process.Fellow analyst James Seyffart also expressed concern over the SEC’s inaction, questioning the reasons behind the lack of communication when the applications were anticipated.Beyond the immediate impact on spot ETFs, the ongoing regulatory disputes cast a shadow over the entire Ethereum ecosystem. Adding fuel to the fire, Uniswap Labs, a developer of the software on which Uniswap – a widely used DEX – facilitates trading, announced on April 10 its intention to “fight” after receiving notice that the SEC is mulling a lawsuit against the company. While details remain unclear, Uniswap claims that its UNI token is not a security and that its platform doesn’t qualify as a US securities exchange or broker. Meanwhile, on April 25, software development company Consensys filed a lawsuit against the SEC and its five commissioners over claims it plans “to regulate ETH as a security.”But even amid the regulatory uncertainty surrounding Ethereum in the US, Hong Kong has taken a bold step forward. On April 30, the Hong Kong Stock Exchange launched spot Bitcoin- and Ether-based ETFs. The Hong Kong-based ETFs – managed by China Asset Management, Harvest Global, Bosera and HashKey – only reached $12.4 million in trading volume during the first day, which pales compared to the first-day trading volume of U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs, valued at $4.6 billion. Although the volume was relatively small, it’s important to note that Hong Kong’s ETF market is significantly smaller than the US market.Ethereum Ecosystem Updates 
The Ethereum ecosystem continues to buzz with innovation, focusing on scalability, security and stablecoins. Here’s a breakdown of some key developments from April 2024.ZK-proofs for Streamlined Business ProcessesBig Four accounting firm Ernst & Young (EY) launched an Ethereum-based solution called EY OpsChain Contract Manager (OCM), which will use zero-knowledge proofs to help its private business clients simplify complex contracts. OKX Embraces Layer 2 for Lower FeesCryptocurrency exchange OKX announced integration with Ethereum Layer-2 solutions. This integration aims to provide users with significantly lower transaction fees and faster settlement times when trading on Ethereum.USDC Expands to ZKSyncStablecoin issuer Circle expanded support for its native stablecoin, USD Coin (USDC) to Ethereum zero-knowledge layer-2 solution zkSync. This move will enable users to make fast and low-cost USDC transactions on ZKSync. “Many leading ecosystem apps and DeFi protocols are expected to support native USDC on zkSync for payments, trading, borrowing, lending,” wrote Circle in its April 9 announcement. The zkSync integration expands USDC’s reach to a total of 16 blockchains, including major players like Ethereum, Solana, Base and Arbitrum. Ethena USDe Now Available on Binance, Bybit, OKX, and BitgetEthena Labs, the team behind USDe, added Bitcoin as collateral to its synthetic dollar-backed stablecoin on the Ethereum network, hoping to scale “significantly” from its current $2 billion supply. Ethena Labs also integrated with centralized exchange wallets of Binance, Bybit, OKX, and Bitget and airdropped a total of $450 million worth of Ethena (ENA) tokens to participants in April. Movement Labs to Build Network of Move-based BlockchainsMovement Labs, a San Francisco-based blockchain development team, secured $38 million in a Series A funding round. The funding round was led by Polychain Capital and included participation from prominent firms like Aptos Labs, Bankless Ventures, OKX Ventures and eight other venture capitalists.Movement Labs aims to leverage Move-based Ethereum Virtual Machines (EVMs) to address security vulnerabilities and improve transaction throughput within the Ethereum ecosystem. These Move-EVMs offer enhanced protection against reentrancy attacks, a common exploit that has plagued major protocols like Curve and KyberSwap in the past.According to Movement Labs, smart contract vulnerabilities led to a staggering $5.4 billion in losses between 2022 and 2023. Their solution aims to mitigate these risks and build a more secure foundation for future blockchain applications.Ethereum-Based Protocols and DEXs
DeFi total value locked nearly doubled in Q1 2024 (from a Q4 2023 low of $36 billion to peak at almost $97 billion in the first quarter of 2024), reaching a two-year high. Ethereum’s liquid staking innovations, particularly Lido and EigenLayer’s explosive growth, are key drivers, according to the report published by QuickNode and Artemis.According to recent data from CryptoQuant, Ethereum staking hit a new all-time high, with over 27,1% of all Ether now staked (on April 28), despite the fluctuating ETH price. Ethereum staking rate in %. Source: CryptoQuantEarlier this year, Ethereum focused its development efforts on improving the blockchain’s ability to process Layer 2 transaction data, as exemplified by the March 13 Dencun upgrade, which lowered Layer 2 transaction fees. This focus on scalability will benefit Layer 2 networks like Base or Optimum. Analysts at VanEck predict that the Ethereum scaling ecosystem, which could include thousands of specialized Layer 2 chains, could reach $1 trillion in market capitalization by 2030.EigenLayer Launched its New TokenOn April 29, the largest restaking protocol by TVL on Ethereum introduced a white paper outlining its new token, EIGEN. This token is designed to power applications requiring verifiable consensus, like prediction markets, data storage solutions and virtual gaming environments. Several regions, including the United States and Canada, will be excluded from the upcoming airdrop.EigenLayer removed the limits on all liquid staking tokens (LSTs) on April 16, according to an X announcement. EigenLayer launched on mainnet on April 10. While users staking LSTs via EigenLayer get a cut of rewards, the lower security needs of Actively Validated Services (AVSs) could be a future concern. On April 22, pseudonymous developer Chudnov stated that EigenLayer may soon face a “yield crisis” as the value of the assets locked on its platform is growing faster than what is needed to secure the network. Uniswap Surpassed $2 Trillion in Trading VolumeThe largest DEX operating on the Ethereum blockchain, Uniswap, eclipsed $2 trillion in total trading volume on April 5. This achievement comes just over five and a half years after Uniswap’s launch in November 2018 Data from a Dune Analytics dashboard, compiled by Uniswap’s Zach Wong (Strategy & Operations Lead). The total number of wallets on Uniswap skyrocketed from 3.03 million in May 2023 to 7.26 million in May 2024, an increase of approximately 140%.Additionally, Uniswap recently integrated with Robinhood Connect to allow its users to purchase cryptocurrencies with funds from their Robinhood accounts or a debit card, as well as via bank transfer.Puffer Finance Fuels Liquid Staking Growth Puffer Finance, a liquid staking project built on Ethereum restaking protocol EigenLayer,  successfully raised $18 million in a Series A funding round. This influx of capital will likely fuel further development of their platform, which allows users to stake ETH while maintaining liquidity.According to DefiLlama, Puffer Finance surpassed a TVL of $1.2 billion shortly after its early testing phase in February. To date, the protocol has raised a total of $23 million in venture capital funding.Puffer Finance’s TVL since launch. Source: DefiLlamaEtherscan Ads Fuel Massive Phishing CampaignA large-scale phishing campaign has been uncovered, targeting users of the popular Ethereum blockchain explorer, Etherscan. On April 8, a vigilant community member known as McBiblets identified several Etherscan advertisements as fraudulent. These ads, disguised as legitimate content, aimed to steal users’ crypto wallets when clicked.Degen Chain Reached the Highest TPSA new player has emerged in the Ethereum scaling race: Degen Chain. Launched in late March, this application-specific Layer-3 blockchain leverages Arbitrum Orbit’s technology and Base’s settlement layer for Ethereum. This approach seems to be paying off, as Degen Chain achieved on April 19 the highest transaction count per second (TPS) within the Ethereum ecosystem over a 24-hour period. Clocking in at 35.7 TPS, Degen Chain even surpassed Base, the layer-2 solution it utilizes, which reached 29.7 TPS during the same timeframe. Ethereum NFTs 
NFT sales volumes for all blockchains declined in April after hitting a year-to-date high in early March. Ethereum NFT sales led the pack with a significant drop in line with the fluctuating ETH price.According to CryptoSlam data, the sales volume of Ethereum-based NFTs reached $240.8 million in April, 103% less than the values recorded in March ($488.9 million). The data further revealed that the Ethereum network has attracted around 69k buyers and 59k sellers of NFTs during April. The number of NFT transactions on Solana reached more than 509k in March, 27% less than the previous month (648k). The most traded NFTs last month were Bitcoin-based “Uncategorized Ordinals”, followed by Ethereum-based NFTs CryptoPunks and Bored Ape Yacht Club. Sales volume for Ethereum-based NFTs reached $240,8 million in April. Source: CryptoSlamIn a noteworthy sale, a CryptoPunk NFT from the CryptoPunks series has been sold for 4,000 ETH (approximately $12.4 million).

Looking Ahead – Can the ETH Price Go Higher?
April presented a mixed bag for Ethereum and its ecosystem. The month commenced with significant price volatility for ETH, marked by a sharp decline from its peak on April 8 to a 50-day low by April 13. Despite a partial recovery mid-month, ETH faced resistance in breaking key resistance levels, reflecting underlying weakness in the market sentiment.On the on-chain front, Ethereum exhibited signs of both strength and weakness. While total value locked (TVL) in DeFi surged to its highest levels since July 2022, indicating sustained activity within DeFi, other metrics like daily active addresses and daily transactions saw declines over the month. Moreover, Ethereum-based crypto investment products experienced negative outflows, contrasting with the positive inflows seen in some other altcoins.Regulatory uncertainties surrounding the approval of spot Ether ETFs in the U.S. loomed large over investor sentiment. The SEC’s delay in decisions regarding several spot Ether ETF proposals, coupled with concerns expressed by industry analysts, contributed to market apprehension. The lack of clarity on whether Ethereum qualifies as a security further added to the ambiguity surrounding regulatory oversight.Despite the regulatory challenges, the Ethereum ecosystem continued to witness notable developments in scalability and security. Projects like EY OpsChain Contract Manager (OCM), Circle’s USDC expansion, and Ethena Labs’ USDe integration showcased ongoing innovation within the Ethereum space.The proliferation of Layer 2 solutions and the burgeoning DeFi ecosystem underscored Ethereum’s resilience and potential for long-term growth. However, concerns lingered regarding security vulnerabilities and scalability issues, as evidenced by movements like Movement Labs’ efforts to address smart contract risks.NFT activities on the Ethereum blockchain saw a decline in sales volume compared to March, reflecting broader market trends. Nonetheless, notable sales such as the acquisition of a rare CryptoPunk NFT and Louis Vuitton’s foray into NFTs highlighted continued interest and adoption in the NFT space.

Crypto firms brace for intensified SEC, CFTC action after regulator warning

The inflow of new investors into the crypto industry has been a boon for adoption but has also come at a cost. Now more than ever, the crypto industry is under the watchful eye of regulators concerned about market manipulation, investor protection, and the potential for crypto to facilitate illicit activities. The United States Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) has warned that more enforcement actions will be taken against the crypto ecosystem in the coming six months to two years.On May 6, during the 27th Annual Milken Institute Global Conference, CFTC Chair Rostin Behnam said that with the rise in the price of cryptocurrency and the inflow of new, inexperienced retail investors, there will be another cycle filled with crypto-centered scams and frauds. “We’re going to probably see in the next 6 to 18 months, or 6 to 24 months, another cycle of enforcement actions because of this cycle of asset appreciation and interest by retail investors,” he said.With no legal framework presently in place to regulate crypto service providers, the CFTC chair expects watchdogs to crack down on crypto firms.Since 2023, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and the CFTC have cracked down heavily on crypto firms, with both agencies recording their largest number of enforcement actions against crypto firms last year. According to research by the litigation consulting firm Cornerstone Research, SEC enforcement actions reached a 10-year high in 2023, with digital assets taking a “top priority” for the commission’s attention. The SEC tripled the number of administrative proceedings in 2022 and initiated 46 enforcement actions in 2023. The regulator imposed $281 million in fines for settlements.One-third of all CFTC crypto enforcement actions in 2023 were against crypto firms. The CFTC took 47 enforcement actions representing over one-third of the total enforcement actions brought by the commission since 2015.U.S. regulators have multiple cases pending against U.S. crypto firms such as Kraken, Binance and Coinbase. Regulators continued their enforcement efforts in 2024 when, in April, the U.S. Justice Department arrested the founders of a privacy-focused Samurai wallet on money laundering charges. In May, the SEC issued a Wells notice against Robinhood.U.S. regulators target broker-dealers and mixersAmid ominous warnings from the CFTC chair and increased enforcement actions against crypto firms, crypto companies are bracing for regulatory actions in the next few years. Patrick Gruhn, a former partner at Crypto Lawyers, a Swiss law firm, told Cointelegraph that the SEC and other U.S. regulatory bodies’ enforcement actions indicate they are targeting crypto firms with a broker-dealer business model:“The SEC targets business models and firms that, from a high-level perspective, compete with traditional finance, e.g., broker-dealers. If a project or company allows people to speculate on the price of crypto assets or generate interest-like payments, such a firm or project team is at risk, whether it considers itself decentralized or not.“Another area of focus for law enforcement agencies seems to revolve around privacy and mixer tools. U.S. agencies have sanctioned popular crypto-mixing services such as Tornado Cash and, more recently, arrested the founders of another privacy-focused wallet services provider, Samurai. Recent: Despite Bitcoin price volatility, factors point to BTC’s long-term successWhile the crypto community has mixed reactions to using mixing and privacy-focused services, a majority opposes the persecution of the founders and creators of such services for writing neutral code and doing nothing illegal.Lack of U.S. crypto regulation could impact industryThe lack of a legislative framework and enforcement jurisdiction for different agencies has created more complexities for crypto firms and law enforcement agencies alike. Keith Blackman, a partner in the New York City office of the Bracewell law firm, told Cointelegraph that in the past, the CFTC chair has often expressed concern about the lack of a comprehensive regulatory framework governing cryptocurrencies in the U.S., starkly contrasting to SEC Chair Gensler’s eagerness to proceed with enforcement actions without the need for crypto-specific regulations. According to Blackman, Behnam’s comments suggest that “the CFTC is gradually aligning its perspective with the SEC.”He added that new crypto companies would be “deterred from entering the market with the added threat of CFTC enforcement without clear-cut regulations. Existing companies, meanwhile, will need to invest more resources in legal and compliance counsel, increasing costs and potentially stifling innovation.”Neal Levin, a partner at Rimon Law, told Cointelegraph that poor policies and lack of legislation lead to uncertainty about how to behave. If the regulators and enforcers have no legislative framework, they will attempt to fit their business models into the existing regulatory framework:“Using crackdowns is a means of shaping behavior and providing guidance short of new legislation. However, this is certainly hampered and will continue to be hampered by the ongoing uncertainty over the classification of digital assets, i.e., whether they are to be deemed ‘securities,’ as we’re seeing with Robinhood and the SEC currently and several other cases.”At a time when other jurisdictions have or are actively developing comprehensive crypto regulations, the U.S. is still following the “regulations by enforcement” approach, which has already forced several established businesses to modify their offerings or shut down entirely. Recent: EU crypto regulations undermined by lack of enforcement, say observersKraken has already shut down its staking-as-a-service platform in the U.S., while the CFTC has charged the operators of Kraken with running an illegal digital asset derivatives exchange.Despite the dramatic uptick in regulator actions against crypto firms, Wall Street is warming up to digital assets.The launch of spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds and investment from traditional financial institutions highlights the growing interest of the traditional financial sector in the crypto market. Some market observers have also noted that crypto holders are growing as a political force in the U.S., making the prospect of more friendly regulation seem not so impossible.

U.S. officials seek easier pathways to ban AI exports and keep tech secrets in

Legislators in the United States have unveiled a bipartisan bill that would aid the Biden administration in imposing export controls on top artificial intelligence (AI) models created in the country. In the late evening of May 8, House Republicans Michael McCaul and John Molenaar and Democrats Raja Krishnamoorthi and Susan Wild announced the bill, which aims to make any future regulations on AI exports bypass legal challenges. It would also give the Commerce Department “express authority” to hinder American citizens from employment with foreign agents in the development of AI systems that would pose a potential risk to U.S. national security. Under the current legislation, it is more difficult for the U.S. Commerce Department, which oversees export policy, to regulate open-source AI models. If the newly suggested bill passes it would minimize any roadblocks to regulating open source AI exports. This move follows a Wednesday report from Reuters that said the U.S. is ready to take action to safeguard its homegrown AI from China and Russia. It said it will implement export controls on its most advanced proprietary AI models. China has been known to utilize open-source models originating from the U.S., like Meta’s Llama models, to develop its own AI. Related: AI-powered smart contracts could be ‘transformative’ — Ava Labs founderIt also follows a recent agreement on April 16 between Microsoft and the United Arab Emirates (UAE) AI company based in Dubai, the G42. Microsoft pledged a $1.5 billion deal with the UAE to bolster local AI innovation. This deal will also give the UAE access to cutting-edge AI technologies developed in the U.S. by Microsoft. It is one of the many deals made by Microsoft with foreign governments regarding the development and use of its AI models and cloud services. However, the U.S.’s main concern continues to be high-level AI technology falling into the hands of the Chinese government. In November 2023, 01.AI - one of China’s most high-profile AI companies founded by a former Google executive Lee Kai-fu, revealed that its AI model Yi-34B was built using Meta’s Llama system. This is one of many steps the U.S. government has taken to sanction China and minimize its reach into U.S.-made AI tech. In January, the Chinese AI firm Baidu faced potential sanctions over the People’s Liberation Army’s (PLA’s) alleged use of the company's technology for military endeavors. Magazine: How to stop the artificial intelligence apocalypse: David Brin, Uplift author

Zilliqa battles back-to-back network disruptions amid latest upgrade rollout

Zilliqa network has recently experienced a number of operational disruptions, impacting block production on its mainnet. However, as of May 10, full network functionality has been restored — though the cause is still under investigation.The Zilliqa team notified the community that the network was now online following “temporary disruptions to block production on mainnet.” With network functionality restored, the infrastructure team is continuing to “monitor the stability of the network as it works to diagnose the underlying cause of the recent disruptions.” Source: https://twitter.com/zilliqa/status/1788860703492727290Since the initial signs of disruption on May 8, when a slowdown in block generation was identified, the Zilliqa network technical team has remained active for almost 48 hours, aiming to prevent further disruptions. On May 9 at around 9:30 am UTC, the Zilliqa technical team discovered a malfunction that returned a null value “instead of a node’s RLP following a possible invalid database lookup.” “The team has created internal rehearsal networks to recreate this issue and trial bug fixes, allowing for possible solutions to be tested within an isolated environment before progressing to Testnet and mainnet deployments.”By around 2:30 pm UTC on May 9, the team had restored full functionality through a fix, alongside the rollout of the Zilliqa version 9.3.4 network upgrade. The team noted that the upgrade would include “a number of enhancements to EVM compatibility” and apologized for the inconvenience caused to users and the Zilliqa community.However, despite the fix and upgrade rollout, a further disruption to block production hit the Zilliqa mainnet again on May 9 around 7:05PM UTC. At this point the team enhanced debugging processes to better diagnose the issue and address the root cause of the disruption.This is not the first time Zilliqa block production has been hit with disruptions due to technical issues. In December 2023, an “interruption to block production” saw daily Zilliqa blockchain transactions plunge roughly 50% — from around 61,000 to 30,906.The Zilliqa team is continuing to investigate the underlying cause of the recent network disruptions and thanks the community for their “patience and support during the course of resolving” the issue.

Binance obtains FIU approval for India return

Global cryptocurrency exchange Binance has obtained approval to offer its services in India from an Indian financial regulator called the Financial Intelligence Unit (FIU). The recent approval makes Binance the second off-shore crypto exchange to get a regulatory nod after KuCoin.According to a report published in CoinDesk, Vivek Agarwal, the head of FIU, said that Binance is now a registered entity. Binance and KuCoin were among nearly a dozen foreign crypto exchanges that received a notice of noncompliance in December 2023. Within 15 days of notice, the Indian Finance Ministry told its IT department to block URLs and mobile applications' access to the banned crypto platforms in India in mid-January 2024.Besides Binance and KuCoin, Huobi, Kraken, Gate.io, Bittrex, Bitstamp, MEXC Global, and Bitfinex also received the regulatory notice.Following the ban, several crypto platforms started working with the Indian regulatory body to obtain FIU compliance and offer their services to Indian customers. While KuCoin and Binance managed to find their way back, the likes of OKX and BitStamp have closed their services in the country.Although the FIU registration reports surfaced today, Cointelegraph reported in the third week of April that Binance will likely return to India after paying a $2 million fine for noncompliance. Related: Taxman: India’s new tax policies could prove fatal for crypto industryAfter India imposed a hefty 30% tax on crypto gains and a 1% tax deduction at source on every crypto transaction, Indian investors fled to foreign crypto exchanges to bypass the tax regime. At the peak of the tax drain, Binance reportedly accounted for 90% of the total trading volume from India.Despite being a thriving crypto market with most of the major crypto exchanges looking to set foot in the country, India has cooled on the crypto heat map owing to its tax impositions and lack of regulatory clarity. A large chunk of crypto traders and crypto-centered businesses have shifted overseas while a few crypto exchanges that have remained continue to struggle to garner investor trust due to lack of banking facilities.Cointelegraph reached out to Binance and FIU for comments but had yet to receive a response at publishing time.Magazine: Bitcoin Halving will pump games, Shrapnel’s ‘simple’ secret revealed: Web3 Gamer

FTX Co-Founder Trades Rice in Jail Amid Fraud Conviction Appeal


							

Despite facing incarceration and significant weight loss, Bankman-Fried maintains his innocence and diligently prepares for his appeal.



Life in jail presents unexpected challenges, with rice emerging as a vital commodity for sustenance and a symbol of Bankman-Fried’s humble reality.



Bankman-Fried depicts himself as a victim of negligence rather than criminal intent.




Sam Bankman-Fried, co-founder of FTX, is now using rice as currency while he is being detained in MDC, Brooklyn, for his fraudulent activities and will serve a 25-year sentence. Bankman-Fried is still fighting for his innocence, and in a recent interview with Puck News, he talked about his life in prison and his plans for an appeal.



Bankman-Fried’s imprisonment caused a drastic transformation in lifestyle, with rice being a prominent commodity in the MDC. Despite getting vegan meals that his other convicts find unappealing, Bankman-Fried subsists on beans and rice, demonstrating the harsh realities of his captivity.



However, life behind bars is not without its challenges. Bankman-Fried faces boredom and sleep disturbances, with limited entertainment options and fellow inmates frequently interrupting his rest to inquire about his rice supplies. Despite these difficulties, he remains focused on his legal battle, diligently engaging with his new lawyer and preparing for his upcoming appeal.



The former CEO’s physical transformation is notable, shedding 25 pounds and displaying a calmer demeanor during the interview. He candidly admitted to “faking” his well-being, suggesting a level of resilience amidst adversity.



Despite submitting an appeal against his conviction, Bankman-Fried maintains adamant that he is innocent, stating that his failure was due to negligence rather than illegal activity. His choice to appeal demonstrates his determination to contest the legal ruling and find justice.



Bankman-Fried depicts himself as someone who was not to blame for FTX’s failure but rather was the one who suffered as a result of circumstances. He regrets not giving the governance of Alameda Research to another person as this might have improved his legal situation because it could have eliminated potential conflicts of interest.









His reliance on medication for clarity of thought and regular consultations with his lawyer indicates a strategic approach to his legal battle. However, the uncertainty of his future looms large, with the possibility of relocation to a facility near his parents in California.



The logistical challenges of potential relocation, including a lengthy prison bus journey, add to the complexity of Bankman-Fried’s situation. Despite the adversities he faces, his determination to pursue his appeal remains unwavering.

Empire Newsletter: How crypto can solve AI's centralization problem - Blockworks


Why AI needs crypto
Crypto is very good at one thing: getting humans to do one thing. This will become incredibly important in an AI world. 
Technology is deflationary and creates abundance, but it is also a centralizing force. Look at Google (owns 90% of search) and social (TikTok, Meta). 
Chris Dixon documents this phenomenon well in his latest book “Read Write Own.” Unlike internet protocols (TCP/IP, HTTPS, SMTP), internet service companies like Google and Meta have amassed monopoly-like market shares. These companies own your data and, after achieving scale, adopt monopoly-like practices to squash competition. Meta shut down their App Store, OpenAI did the same, and Google has crushed multiple calendar-app startups. 
In theory, you can use other social media platforms, but none achieve the same level of network effects as TikTok or Meta. 
Read more: AI has a monopoly on power and privacy. Blockchain fixes this.
The centralizing effect of technology may be even greater with AI. I recently came across Anthropic’s CEO interview on CNBC where he estimates “we’re going to see models trained in the next year are going to be about $1 billion…and then 2025, 2026, we’re going to go to $5 billion or $10 billion. And I think there’s a chance it may go beyond that to $100 billion.” Few companies will afford that. 
Perhaps more importantly, companies that own the data will have an edge to train models. A startup may be able to raise a couple billion, but they won’t be able to easily replicate clinical trial data or years of user behavior data.
The promise of technology is that it is democratizing and lowers the barriers for companies to reap the benefits. This narrative rings true with AI  — after all, companies will be able to embed LLMs and other forms of AI (robots, automation processes etc)  to unlock productivity gains. Like trickle-down economics, trickle-down tech will benefit many. But the centralizing effect of technology will likely be no different and perhaps even greater with AI. 
So where does crypto fit into all of this?
Crypto has proven to be very good at getting humans to do a specific action which benefits the overall network. From Bitcoin to DePIN, crypto networks are case studies on how to scale networks more efficiently by transferring the costs to do-it-yourself (DIY) participants incentivized to spend resources (time, hardware, compute) expecting to earn in return tokens which represent ownership in the network. 
The challenge is that bootstrapping and scaling the supply side of networks can be very capex-intensive in these networks. Historically, this has been one of the reasons why there is network centralization. You have 1-2 ride-sharing companies and social media platforms. But when you radically lower the financial burden to bootstrap a network from a company/protocol to participants, then you level the playing field. 
You can more easily overcome the cold-start problem networks face by attracting supply and demand because both sides are incentivized to earn tokens (i.e., ownership in the network).
Giving network participants a greater cut of revenue/profits will be the reason why crypto networks from DePIN to AI will emerge as leaders and will be able to displace incumbents. 
One area I see this already playing out is in training — specifically, reinforced learning from human feedback (RLHF). 
In short, AI models with human feedback are superior to AI models without it. The more RLHF you have, the better the model. Capturing human feedback can be very expensive. But again, crypto has proven to be good at getting people to do a specific action with token incentives, so we may be able to create systems that capture RLHF in greater scale and in a more cost-effective manner than traditional methods. 
Instead of having one company to raise a ton of VC money to fund RLHF, a network can finance this with clever cryptoeconomics.
Crypto may also be crucial to minimize data selection for training bias (data is open, accessible and immutable in blockchains) and platform risk. 
Look at Google’s Gemini as an example — one platform has many opinions on the data on which the models are trained. The bet is that companies/developers will want certainty that the models they are utilizing are as unbiased as possible and have cryptographic proofs that models are doing what they are being told.
The most exciting thing about this is that the impact crypto can have on AI is already being felt. 
AI will be explosive. Its effect will be felt by everyone, but incumbents may capture even more value. Crypto offers an interesting and viable solution to counteract the centralizing force of technology and restore the original principles of the internet. I see a world where crypto —  specifically, this idea of creating participatory networks — will become the de facto go-to-market mechanism for networks. 
Crypto is the extension pack of the internet.

Bitcoin’s price is up over 3% to $63,000 early Friday.
Marathon mined 2,811 BTC last quarter, a decrease of over 30% from the previous quarter.

Not selling is still holding
BlackRock’s memecoin balance is piling up.
Nearly $200,000 in random tokens are parked in addresses linked to BlackRock’s onchain money market fund, BUIDL. New deposits come in every day.
To be clear, BlackRock is not buying memecoins, despite the spoofed Uniswap trades that suggest it had bought trillions of BOMEPEPE.
It’s long been tradition for memecoin holders, and maybe even the creators themselves, to direct funds to the wallets of popular figures. 
Read more from our opinion section: BlackRock clearly wants to take crypto seriously. Too bad it’s forever silly.
Think of it as part hat-tip, part marketing spend — the onchain equivalent of renting a billboard inside a blockchain explorer.
BUIDL’s onchain history has seen more than 500 transactions but only about two dozen appear to be actioned by BlackRock itself. 
BlackRock initially funded BUIDL with 1 ETH from Kraken and 200 USDC minted directly via Circle. The fund then sent small amounts of USDC between itself, in early-to-mid March, apparently to warm up, about a week before the fund was formally announced.
Since then, Larry Fink’s firm, the world’s largest asset manager, has been interacting with Ondo Finance, which has been acquiring BUIDL’s tokens as one of its reserve assets (there are currently 13 holders of BUIDL). 
All while almost 300 different tokens have flooded BUIDL’s addresses, not just on Ethereum, but on any EVM-compatible chain with an analogous wallet, including Binance Smart Chain, Polygon and Avalanche.
Most of the tokens sent to BlackRock to date are worthless. But there are some with active markets, which gives them real value, and not all are strictly memecoins. 
Caution is advised when looking into any of these tokens — their place in BlackRock’s wallet isn’t exactly an endorsement.
BlackRock has been forced to hold more than $60,000 worth of UBXS alongside its legitimate stablecoin balance. UBXS is pitched as a utility asset for tokenized real estate app Bixos. 
There’s also nearly $30,000 of ISP, which supposedly powers open-world, play-to-earn metaverse platform Ispoverse that can support virtual hackathons. 
Although, I’m not sure it really helps perception of those projects to be placed alongside tokens like FINKWIF, NOODS, PEEON and BOBO MUMU.
Still, BlackRock hasn’t sold any of the tokens playing stowaway in its Ethereum wallet. Does that count for anything? 
Probably not. Sad.
— David Canellis
The Works

Kraken is pushing harder for a dismissal in its SEC lawsuit, Bloomberg writes. 
Token projects are increasingly turning to online influencers for help, according to CoinDesk’s Danny Nelson.
Neel Somani, founder of Ethereum scaling startup Eclipse, says he is “reducing” his role amid sexual misconduct allegations made against him. 
Espresso and Polygon Labs are partnering on rollup interoperability.
US airlines are expanding their use of AI, according to the New York Times.

The Morning Riff
Pump.fun is exactly what Gary Gensler and the SEC are afraid of. 
It’s also one of those things that is so unique to crypto — mixing fun with the potential to profit. 
But it’s also risky, as Blockworks reporter Jack Kubinec pointed out in the Lightspeed newsletter yesterday. Folks who go to casinos are probably of the same mindset as a lot of folks on Pump.fun, and for them, the risk is worth the potential reward. 
For the SEC and Gensler, though, this is a scenario they claim they want to protect investors from. While Pump.fun says it prevents rug pulls or exit scams, it can’t stop shady people from doing shady stuff. 
So while the SEC continues its crusade against companies that have said they want to — or have tried to — come in and register, I’ll sit back and watch crypto’s latest venture play out.

Jupiter now accounts for 50% of Solana’s computational load.Siong, the co-founder of Jupiter, Solana’s leading DEX aggregator, unveiled a target launch date for the protocol’s mobile app.Speaking during the Solana Crossroads 2024 conference, Siong revealed that the project is aiming to roll out its mobile app during “late May or early June.” Siong noted that a “test flight” version of the application is already “up and running,” with Jupiter currently in the process of submitting the mobile app to Apple for approval.The news comes as Jupiter is driving a dominant share of trading activity on Solana.Siong estimated that Jupiter accounts for roughly 50% of Solana’s computational load per block, and is receiving more than 250,000 requests from users per second.According to Jupiter Station, Jupiter hosted nearly 1.85 million transactions in the past 24 hours, equating to nearly $809 million in trade volume.The project also launched a perpetual contracts trading platform roughly seven months ago, which has since grown to capture a roughly 70% to 75% market share for perps trading on Solana.The Jupiter Perpetual Exchange currently boasts a total value locked (TVL) of $340.7 million and drove $424.5 million worth of volume in the past 24 hours, according to DeFi Llama.JUP rollercoasterJupiter also airdropped its JUP token to 955,000 early adopters in January, with the token debuting at a $900 million market cap, according to CoinGecko.Like many airdropped assets, JUP slumped during its first month of trade, falling 29% to post an all-time low of $0.47 two weeks after launching. The downward momentum was intensified by backlash from Jupiter’s community in response to Jupiter moving to sell 18.5% of JUP’s supply via its LFG Launchpad just a couple of days after the airdrop.However, JUP began to regain steam in late February, rallying to a record high of $1.75 in early April. The token has since pulled back by 36.6%, last changing hands for $1.11.JUP/USD.

'Shiba Inu On Solana' Bonk In For An 'Explosive Rally,' Millionaire Trader Predicts - Benzinga

Crypto trader Unipics, also known as “Bonk Guy,” shared his bullish outlook on Bonk BONK/USD, forecasting an imminent explosive rally.What Happened: “Bonk guy” attributes BONK’s recent weakness, particularly on weekends, to the ongoing vesting of tokens to OpenBook users. Every Friday, 161 billion tokens, worth around $4 million, are released, creating a significant source of sell pressure. However, with less than two weeks remaining until the vesting period ends, the trader anticipates a shift in market dynamics.Despite the recent challenges, the trader highlights BONK’s impressive performance in 2023, noting that it was the best-performing meme coin of the year. In the past year, Bonk hit a peak of over $2 billion in market capitalization, despite many market participants believing it to be "dead."Also Read: Trader Who Made ‘Giga Wealth’ On Memes Reveals ‘Mememillions Playbook,’ Still Holds Most Of His DOGEWhy It Matters: “Bonk guy,” who gained notoriety for riding a trade from five to eight figures, emphasizes the inherent volatility of meme coins, stating that they can be "insanely volatile, both to the upside and downside." He predicts that when BONK rallies next, it will trigger a fear of missing out (FOMO) among investors, causing the token to "absolutely rip."The analysis highlights the significant impact that vesting periods and token releases can have on the price action of cryptocurrencies, particularly meme coins.The meme coin has witnessed a significant surge in its performance and strengthened its position in the top six of the meme coin table. It is currently valued at $1.6 billion, up 14.5% month-over-month, compared to Dogecoin’s 20% and Shiba Inu’s 15% drops, respectively.Price Action: At the time of writing, BONK was trading at $0.00002444, up 2.5% in the past 24 hours.What’s Next: The influence of Bitcoin as an institutional asset class is expected to be thoroughly explored at Benzinga’s upcoming Future of Digital Assets event on Nov. 19.Read Next: VanEck Meme Coin Index With DOGE And SHIB Would ‘Outperform 99% Of People If You Left It Alone,’ Says TraderThis content was partially produced with the help of AI tools and was reviewed and published by Benzinga editors.Image: Shutterstock

Crypto Clash: Kraken Fights SEC's Definition Of Securities


								Crypto exchange Kraken has intensified its fight against the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) by formally submitting a reply in support of its motion to dismiss the agency’s lawsuit. The filing, dated May 9, 2024, challenges the SEC’s claim that Kraken operated as an unregistered exchange dealing with securities, specifically “investment contracts.”
Led by Matthew C. Solomon from Cleary Gottlieb Steen & Hamilton LLP, Kraken’s legal team disputes the SEC’s allegations, asserting that no specific investment contracts traded, brokered, or settled on Kraken’s platform have been identified. They argue that crypto assets alone, which are the only products alleged to have been handled by Kraken, do not meet the definition of investment contracts under federal securities laws.
Kraken Fights For The Entire Crypto Industry
The filing emphasizes a critical flaw in the SEC’s approach, accusing the regulatory body of conflating primary offerings conducted outside of Kraken with secondary crypto market transactions on the platform. Kraken’s attorneys contend that the SEC’s approach ignores the distinct legal treatment required for primary and secondary market transactions under the Securities Act of 1933 and the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.

Kraken’s submission states, “The transactions alleged to have occurred on Kraken are blind bid/ask secondary market sales of digital assets… unaccompanied by any contractual terms or other obligations that may have existed at the initial offering.” This, they argue, could improperly extend the SEC’s regulatory reach to virtually any digital asset or commodity by asserting an associated “investment concept” or “ecosystem.”
Further challenging the SEC’s jurisdiction, Kraken’s lawyers invoke the major questions doctrine, arguing that the expansive interpretation of regulatory authority over crypto assets should be explicitly authorized by Congress, not determined through litigation. They maintain that the Howey Test’s criteria — a standard used to define what constitutes an investment contract — are not met, as there was no investment of money in a common enterprise with a reasonable expectation of profits predominantly from the efforts of others.
The SEC initially sued Kraken in November, after previously settling charges over Kraken’s staking services. In its opposition filed last month, the SEC defended its actions, stating, “it is simply not the case that this enforcement action exceeds the authority Congress granted the SEC.” The SEC argued that its enforcement aligns with the Howey test and its Congressional mandate, dismissing claims of overreach.

The court is scheduled to hear arguments on the motion on June 12, 2024. If Kraken’s motion to dismiss is granted by Judge William H. Orrick, it could set a significant legal precedent for the entire crypto industry, potentially limiting the SEC’s ability to regulate secondary market transactions of crypto assets under the current legislative framework.
At press time, Bitcoin traded at $63,237.

Analyst Says Dogecoin(DOGE) Is a 'Crapshoot,' Could These 3 Meme Coins Have Higher Returns? - Benzinga

Since its launch in 2013, DOGE has not done much to add value to the ecosystem. However, the token has seen some of the largest returns of any asset over the past decade. This feat makes little sense to those outside of the cryptocurrency community, but DOGE supporters believe that buying and HODLing their position is what has led to the gains. However, the euphoria of DOGE's success could come to an end, according to some analysts.Don't Miss:Pav Hundal is an analyst for Swyftx, an Australian cryptocurrency exchange. He noted that the future of DOGE "will depend on the decision-making of the millions of minnow investors who bought DOGE in 2021 and right now are sitting on paper losses." Additionally, Hundal noted that "it's a crapshoot. If most of these people decide to take quick profits during the cycle, you could start to see selling pressure ratchet up."Essentially, Hundal believes that the next small uptick in the price of DOGE will lead to a huge wave of selling that could potentially spell the end for the token. If this logic holds and DOGE could potentially lose its spot as the top memecoin, there are a few other tokens that could potentially be a better investment.Dogwifhat (WIF) is the next pick for a memecoin that could potentially outperform expectations. The token has only been around since December 2023 but has already cemented itself in the top 40 tokens by market cap. It has attracted significant attention, which could lead to gains if DOGE begins to fall.Trending: 1 in 4 Americans own a share of Bitcoin according to NASDAQ, how much would $10 get you today?Another choice is Shiba Inu (SHIB). This project is known as the "Dogecoin killer," as it is making moves to directly compete with and overtake DOGE. To do this, it has created a large ecosystem, complete with a decentralized exchange (DEX), NFT projects, a layer-2 blockchain, and a magazine. This focus on building out an ecosystem, along with its current community of investors could prove fruitful in light of a potential DOGE collapse.Lastly, if you are interested in politics or the upcoming election, MAGA Coin (TRUMP) could be a decent investment. The token has seen enormous gains since its launch in August 2023. It combines memecoins with politics to attract investors. With the election in November, the token could receive more and more attention, which could lead to gains. However, this token is likely the riskiest of the three due to its smaller market cap and the fact that Trump is a very controversial person. So, according to some, the end of DOGE's reign as the top memecoin could come very soon. If this is the case, many may start looking for the next memecoin to make them into a millionaire overnight. Read Next:

Kraken Fights Back in SEC Lawsuit: Is the SEC Overreaching? - DailyCoin


        
A major cryptocurrency exchange has found itself in a heated legal battle with the SEC.



The SEC has accused the exchange of operating as an unregistered securities market.



Kraken believes the SEC’s actions have set a dangerous precedent for future crypto regulation.
The legal battle between cryptocurrency exchange Kraken and the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) heats up as Kraken refutes the agency’s claims. The SEC lawsuit, filed last November, alleges Kraken operated as an unregistered securities exchange and made millions from unregistered securities.Kraken Challenges SEC’s Definition of SecuritiesKraken argues the SEC’s case lacks merit and misinterprets core legal concepts. Their response highlights the agency’s failure to precisely identify which crypto assets constitute securities on the exchange.
Furthermore, Kraken takes issue with the SEC’s use of broad terms like “investment concept” and “ecosystem” instead of established legal terms like “investment contract” and “enterprise.” This, according to Kraken, reflects a fundamental misunderstanding of the case’s legal framework.The SEC’s lawsuit isn’t the first hurdle Kraken has faced. Months prior, they settled charges related to their staking service. This latest lawsuit, however, has broader implications for the entire cryptocurrency industry.Kraken contends that the SEC’s case sets a “dangerous precedent” for the agency’s reach within the crypto sphere. In response to Kraken’s initial motion to dismiss, the SEC filed a lengthy opposition, defending its authority.Howey Test at Heart of Kraken’s DefenseThe crux of Kraken’s defense hinges on a different interpretation of investment contracts. They argue the SEC’s insistence on written contracts is misplaced, as agreements can be oral, expressed, or implied.
Additionally, Kraken references past SEC cases involving initial coin offerings (ICOs) to bolster their argument. These cases, Kraken argues, demonstrate a focus on contractual rights and obligations, a key factor in defining investment contracts under the Howey Test, the legal standard used to determine if an asset is a security.The Howey Test establishes a security based on specific criteria: investment of money in a common enterprise with the expectation of profits derived from the efforts of others.This legal battle unfolds amidst ongoing discussions in the U.S. Congress regarding crypto regulation. Further complicating the picture, eight state attorneys general have filed an amicus brief supporting Kraken’s position, suggesting the SEC may have overstepped its authority.On the Flipside
The amicus brief could be seen as an attempt to limit federal overreach, potentially creating a patchwork of state regulations for crypto.



Kraken’s prior settlement over staking could be used by the SEC to argue the exchange understands the regulatory landscape.
Why This MattersBy challenging the SEC’s definition of securities and their broad reach within crypto, Kraken’s defense could significantly impact how crypto assets are regulated. A win for Kraken could set a clearer standard for classifying cryptocurrencies, potentially reducing regulatory burdens for the industry and fostering innovation.Curious about the role of data in cryptocurrency ETFs?

TSM Stock Gains After Firm Reports 60% Increase in Y/Y Revenue - Tokenist


					
Neither the author, Tim Fries, nor this website, The Tokenist, provide financial advice. Please consult our website policy prior to making financial decisions.



Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (NYSE: TSM) has been experiencing significant stock price surge after reporting its latest earnings. The company’s strong earnings and revenue growth have contributed to the over 4% jump in US-listed shares of the firm today.



TSM Stock Up 78% Over the Past Year



At the time of writing, TSM’s stock price stands at $149.04, reflecting a recent increase of 4.38%. The company has delivered substantial returns to its investors, with a year-to-date return of 43.89% and a remarkable 78.43% increase over the past year. Looking at the long-term performance, TSM’s stock has skyrocketed by 293.58% in the last five years. The company’s market capitalization has reached an impressive $637.90 billion, and its trailing Price to Earnings (P/E) ratio is 27.56. TSM has reported a revenue of $2.25 trillion and a net income available to common stockholders of $857 billion, resulting in a profit margin of 38.16%. Analysts have provided various price targets for TSM, with a high estimate of $188.00 and a low of $150.00.





TSM Reports 60% y/y Revenue Surge Driven by AI Demand



TSM has been reporting strong financial results, driven by the increasing demand for advanced semiconductors used in artificial intelligence (AI) applications. In April, the company’s revenue surged by nearly 60% year-over-year, reaching approximately $7.2 billion. For the first quarter, TSM’s revenue increased by 13% compared to the same period last year, totaling $18.87 billion. The company anticipates continued growth, with a projected 27.6% increase in revenue for the second quarter.



TSM’s ongoing robust performance can be attributed to the sustained high demand for its cutting-edge semiconductor products. The company’s strategic expansions in the United States and Japan aim to mitigate risks associated with its production concentration in Taiwan, considering the geopolitical concerns surrounding the region. These expansions are expected to further strengthen TSM’s position in the global semiconductor market and help the company navigate potential challenges arising from geopolitical tensions.







Do you think TSM’s geopolitical risks are something investors should worry about, given its current place in the global semiconductor industry? Let us know in the comments below.

                        Eduard Jubany Tur, the founder of ZKX, a decentralized perpetual futures exchange on Starknet, sat down for an exclusive interview with Cryptonews Podcast.He talked about the growth of the crypto industry in Asia, which is home to most of the early adopters, and the region’s key relevance for the industry.Tur also discussed differences between crypto users in Asia and the rest of the world, noting that most people are nonetheless still on centralized exchanges rather than in DeFi.Getting people to move to DeFi is currently difficult given its overall complexity, but there are clear solutions, Tur remarked.VIDEOCrypto Growth Starts in Asia
While working in venture capital, Tur was based out of Taiwan, getting a clear view of the Asia market, he said.He helped startup founders across various countries, including Indonesia, India, Thailand, Korea, and China.Through this work, he got to learn the advantages of each country and the specific issues each deals with.Notably, the data showed that “most of the growth in crypto has always come from these markets in Asia.”Most centralized exchanges that we know today and many of the projects were born out of Asia.However, what Tur and his colleagues found is that, centralized exchanges have been very good at targeting emerging market users.DeFi projects, on the other hand, have not.Cryptofolk in Asia is Very Different from Rest of the World
There are some key differences between Asia and other parts of the world, Tur argued.The first is the demographics. Asia has a much younger population, which is also growing massively in terms of purchasing power. They’re starting to have more disposable income for investing.Another notable factor is that Asia has many more risk-takers. They are more willing to try new things and adopt new technologies.“That makes a huge difference when it comes to the adoption of crypto overall,” Tur said.However, each country has its own very unique features as well.For example, South Korea and Japan are massive markets for crypto. People here are more willing to hold coins in the long term and are often passive investors.China, Hong Kong, and Taiwan are looking more towards derivatives and leverage trading. There are more risk-takers here.The Philippines, Indonesia, and Vietnam are also key markets where people initially started farming new coins. People here may have less disposable income but are still willing to invest and provide asymmetric bets in the ecosystem.Additionally, certain governments in Asia have been relatively crypto-friendly, which encouraged industry growth and crypto adoption.All this said, it is important to note that most of these users “are still very much set towards centralized exchanges.”Getting People Off Centralized Exchanges and Into DeFi
Millions of users are on the centralized exchanges, and only a few hundred thousand actively trade in DeFi, Tur remarked.Changing this will require many improvements across the entire user experience of DeFi.One key element is account obstruction. It will provide users with a conduit to replicate Web2 experiences but with Web3 benefits.There are many great design possibilities around account obstruction that should really simplify onboarding, Tur remarked.Another key element is localization. This includes providing products in local languages and adapting them to users’ needs in each particular area.Finally, DeFi has a developer-oriented culture. While this makes sense in the early stages of an industry, it’s time to switch to the user-centric approach.Therefore, it’s necessary to create simple, understandable, and engaging products that bring value to users. That way, new users will be coming to DeFi on their own.This is the part of the cycle we’re going to be facing in the next few years, Tur said.Even Losers Get Rewarded
There’s a need now for innovation that will drive users towards DeFi, away from centralized exchanges.An incremental infrastructure improvement would not be enough. What’s needed is innovation in the user experience.Most trading experiences in DeFi now are boring, Tur said. They’re just a trading terminal without a dynamic and engaging experience.Therefore, ZKX mission is to make trading social and gamified within DeFi, Tur remarked. This can incentivize users to start trading within DeFi.ZKX, for example, had 30-minute trading competitions with three leaderboard categories: volume, profit, and loss.This means that even the losses get some incentives because these traders also contribute to the health of the protocol, Tur said.It’s a balance the platform has been working to build: being a serious, scalable, reputable, and trustworthy platform within DeFi but still simple and fun.____That’s not all.In this interview, Tur also discussed:
his pre-crypto journey and Web2 background;
mining Bitcoin in 2014;
building geolocation and digital mapping services on the blockchain, now one of the use cases for DePIN;
why the team decided to build ZKX on Starknet;
ZKX 30-minute trading competitions;
perpetual swaps and futures, and how these differ from each other and other trading instruments;
creating user-centric platforms that cater to traders of all levels, thus incentivizing engagement while ensuring accessibility.

Hong Kong issuer seeks spot Bitcoin ETF for mainland China

The CEO of Harvest, the issuer of a spot Bitcoin (BTC) exchange-traded fund (ETF) in Hong Kong, is looking to make its Bitcoin ETF accessible to mainland Chinese investors.Harvest CEO and chief investment officer Han Tongli is considering options that would allow mainland China investors to purchase its Bitcoin and Ether (ETH) ETFs. That would be possible by offering its products through Hong Kong’s ETF Connect framework, The South China Morning Post reported on May 9.The ETF Connect was launched in 2022, and it was approved by the China Securities Regulatory Commission and the Securities and Futures Commission. The tool is designed to promote the interaction and integration of Hong Kong and mainland China, offer diverse asset allocation choices and promote liquidity.As long as “everything goes smooth and well” in the next two years, Harvest doesn’t rule out the opportunity of applying for its ETFs to be included in the ETF Connect, CEO Tongli said.Harvest CEO Han Tongli (center) speaks at Bitcoin Asia on May 9, 2024. Source: SCMPThe potential inclusion of Bitcoin and Ether ETFs in the ETF Connect program could be a massive bullish trigger on cryptocurrency markets, as China has a large investor pool. But it’s yet to be seen whether the Chinese government would accept such an opportunity for its citizens, as local authorities have maintained a very restrictive approach toward cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin for many years.According to SCMP, Hong Kong’s Bitcoin and Ether futures-based ETFs — launched in 2022 — have not been included in the Stock Connect.Related: Is China warming up to Bitcoin ETFs? BTC investor’s reply sparks curiosityHong Kong’s capability to provide mainland China investors with a Bitcoin ETF has been a hot issue even before the launch of Bitcoin and Ether ETFs in Hong Kong on April 30, 2024.Many industry analysts didn’t expect a lot of market action from the launch because the Hong Kong ETF market is significantly smaller than the one in the United States or mainland China.According to Bloomberg data, some Hong Kong-based subsidiaries of mainland China companies have 1,400% more assets in the mainland Chinese market than in the local one. According to some sources, all Hong Kong ETFs should account for 0.6% of the U.S. ETF market.Magazine: Binance hits back at WSJ, Hong Kong crypto ETF’s take ‘$50B equivalent’: Asia Express

Refund of $70M 'address poisoning' scam ongoing, over 50% returned | Protos


The victim of a $70 million ‘address poisoning’ scam is in the process of being refunded, following on-chain negotiations with the perpetrator.
At the time of writing, over half of the funds (14,500 ETH, worth $43.5M) have been returned to the victim’s Ethereum address.
Beginning at around 8AM UTC, almost exactly a week after the initial loss of 1155 WBTC, transactions of between 25 ETH ($75k) and 50 ETH ($150k) began to stream into the victims address. The transfers came directly from the hundreds of addresses into which the attacker had previously dispersed the stolen funds.

Address poisoning is a method scammers use to trick crypto users into sending funds to an address which appears almost identical to one they have interacted with previously.
As crypto security firm SlowMist’s report explains, the attack requires pre-emptively generating thousands of addresses, before monitoring blockchain transactions for potential targets. Scammers then send ‘dust’ transactions (of negligible value) from an address which has matching leading and trailing characters, in order to ‘poison’ the victim’s transfer history.

Once the trap is set, the attackers rely on the victim accidentally copy-pasting the malicious address from a wallet or block explorer, inadvertently sending funds directly to the scammer.

In this case, once the attack had proved a success, the resulting 1,155 WBTC were swapped to 22,955 ETH, before being layered into hundreds of further addresses.
The day after making their costly error, the victim sent a message to the scammer via Ethereum’s input data messaging system:
“You won bro.Keep 10% to yourself and get 90% back.Then we’ll forget about that.We both know that 7m will definetely make your life better, but 70m won’t let you sleep well.”
Read more: Here’s what on-chain messages reveal about the $200M Euler Finance hack
The victim kept up the pressure the following day, sending three more messages and setting a deadline for the ‘bounty’ offer.
In SlowMist’s report, published Wednesday, the firm identified previous attacks carried out by the perpetrator as well as an exchange address, OTC desks and IP addresses connected  to their activities (though, as SlowMist points out, these may be simply be VPN addresses). 
Yesterday, the scammer sent an on-chain message asking for the victims’s Telegram handle along with 50 ETH, seemingly a gesture of good faith. From there, negotiations went off-chain.
Earlier today, the refund process began. Over half of the stolen amount has so far arrived over the course of more than 200 transactions, following the victim’s confirmation of receipt of the first batch.

Bitcoin Exchange Kraken Applies to the Court to Reject the Cases Filed Against It by the SEC! Here's the Reason! - Bitcoin Sistemi


Kraken, a leading cryptocurrency exchange, has taken legal action to dismiss lawsuits filed against it by the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), citing concerns about potential repercussions for the broader US financial regulatory framework.
Kraken Wants SEC's Allegations Dismissed
This development comes before the trial, when Judge William H. Orrick is set to preside over the case on June 12 in the Northern District of California, according to court filings.


In documents filed with the court, Kraken claims that denying the SEC's allegations was necessary to avoid what it perceives as a “significant realignment” of the U.S. financial regulatory structure.

The lawsuit, filed by the SEC last November, alleges that Kraken is not registered as a broker, clearinghouse or exchange, and indicates that legal challenges remain after the exchange's previous agreement on the staking service.





Kraken's defense relies on the classification of cryptocurrencies as commodities rather than securities, arguing that the assets listed in the SEC's complaint fall into that category.
In response to Kraken's request to dismiss the case, the SEC filed a 39-page objection last month, asserting its authority to enforce registration requirements for securities brokers.


The SEC rejected Kraken's claim that its jurisdiction exceeded legislative limits, emphasizing that its actions were consistent with Congressional powers to enforce the Securities Act and the Exchange Act.

The Week in Polkadot: Monthly Active Accounts Hit All-Time High - Decrypt

We do the research, you get the alpha!Get exclusive reports and access to key insights on airdrops, NFTs, and more! Subscribe now to Alpha Reports and up your game!Go to Alpha ReportsWelcome to Decrypt’s Week in Polkadot, our regular round-up of the latest developments in the Polkadot ecosystem.The number of monthly active accounts on Polkadot reached an all-time high in April, the highest since the start of 2022 when parachains, one of the ecosystem’s key distinguishing factors, first launched.Meanwhile, ahead of the community vote on Polkadot’s JAM Upgrade being implemented, many parachains, including the smart contract platform Moonbeam, achieved near record highs in active users.You can find out a full breakdown of the statistics here.According to an analysis by blockchain research firm Messari, transactions on Polkadot also rose 48% in the last quarter. XCM messages—which Polkadot uses to communicate with blockchains which use other consensus mechanisms—were up 94% quarter-over-quarter and 314% over the past 6 months.Asynchronous Backing comes to Relay ChainAsynchronous Backing, a new approach to how parachain blocks are validated by the Relay Chain, has been enabled on Polkadot.The Web3 Foundation says that the new update will allow blocks to be produced faster, boost available block space, and enable higher utilization of parachain blocks. This could help use case applications across gaming and DeFi.Compared to traditional ‘Synchronous Backing,’ the new system may lower the risk of discarding potentially helpful block data.With Asynchronous Backing, multiple unincluded parablocks can now exist in the Relay Chain pipeline simultaneously.Parablocks are nuggets of transaction data which are sent from various parachains back to the Relay Chain for validation.In traditional synchronous systems, if a block is not added immediately, it is often discarded, which can waste the network’s computing power unnecessarily.StellaSwap gets new analytics dashboardStellaSwap, one of the most popular DEXs for Polkadot-based tokens, is now available on Dune Analytics.The new public dashboard will allow StellaSwap users to access key metrics about the peer-to-peer marketplace on Dune. These include daily volumes, pool breakdowns, swap volume, active accounts, and unique accounts.Stay on top of crypto news, get daily updates in your inbox.

EigenLayer’s $15B Token Launch Sparks Division for Excluding US, China - Coin Edition


							

The $15B valued DeFi EigenLayer launches its EIGEN token airdrop today. 



However, due to regulations, EigenLayer excluded users from the U.S. and China.



Analysts criticized the lack of transparency as early supporters are blocked from the airdrop.




EigenLayer, a $15 billion valued decentralized finance (DeFi) protocol, is stirring both excitement and controversy in the crypto scene with its upcoming token launch. The project is set to distribute its highly anticipated EIGEN token via an airdrop starting Friday. 



However, the excitement about the free token distribution is marred by controversy due to the exclusion of users from the U.S., China, and other regions. Eigen Labs, the brains behind EigenLayer, cited regulatory uncertainties in the restriction posed to users from the U.S. and China.



Expectedly, the decision has drawn criticism from within the crypto community. Kunal Goel, an analyst at Messari, noted that the promise of the EIGEN token airdrop has been the primary incentive for users to invest in the service. 



Given the new restriction, Goel lamented that many early supporters will be ineligible to claim their tokens. The restrictions even disqualify VPN users and residents of some other countries.









Similarly, Nick Cote from Secondlane expressed dissatisfaction with Eigen Labs’ lack of transparency about jurisdictional restrictions. “Issuers not being upfront with jurisdictional restrictions leaves a sour taste in people’s mouths,” Cote remarked.



Meanwhile, in a recent podcast, Robert Drost of the Eigen Foundation emphasized the importance of adhering to regulatory guidelines. 



After being criticized by the crypto community, EigenLayer revised its airdrop plans by announcing an additional allocation of 28 million EIGEN tokens. Notably, early this year, Eigen Labs secured approximately $165 million in funding from investors, including the prominent a16z (Andreessen Horowitz).



According to DeFiLlama, EigenLayer has attracted a staggering $15.01 billion in assets since its soft launch earlier in 2023.

Furthermore, the project has surpassed other DeFi applications in popularity, partly affecting liquid staking platforms like Lido and Rocket Pool. These platforms have experienced a 27% drop in total value locked since March, with nearly 4% of all ETH now re-staked on EigenLayer.

Coingecko Research: Over 20% of Top Cryptos Are Low Float | Cryptopolitan

A shocking research analysis has been released by Coingecko indicating the little-known side of cryptocurrencies. The research findings identify a unique trend amongst newer cryptocurrencies, raising some eyebrows. The research reveals that nearly a quarter of the Top 300 cryptocurrencies in the market today are low float. Low Float Cryptos- Coingecko ResearchThe Coingecko research defines Low-float as a cryptocurrency with a market cap to full diluted valuation ratio below 0.5. High-float cryptocurrencies would then have a market cap to FDV ratio between 0.5 and 0.99, while a perfect market cap to FDV ratio of 1 represents fully diluted cryptocurrencies. Among the top 300 cryptos in the market, only 24.67% are fully diluted, while a huge chunk is high-float, accounting for 54%. The numbers start to get more interesting as you dive deeper into the analytics. The research reveals that out of the 64 low-float cryptos, 54 of them were launched within the last four years. High-float and Fully Diluted Market Cap CryptocurrenciesCoingecko’s research analytics disclosed that only 74 cryptocurrencies in the top 300 have a perfect market cap to FDV ratio, translating to 24.7%. The fully diluted tokens essentially have no further tokens lined up for release.Of the 74 fully diluted cryptocurrencies, 14 were Memecoins, showing the strong presence of Memecoins in the current crypto market.The high-float tokens account for the largest portion of the top 300 cryptocurrencies, with 54% of the market.  More than half of their total supply is already in circulation. It appears there’s a strong correlation between the age of the cryptocurrency and the market cap to FDV ratio. Mostly, older cryptocurrencies seem to have higher ratios. The research reveals the average market cap to FDV ratio of the top 300 cryptocurrencies to be 0.73, which looks like a healthy figure for the industry. CoinGecko’s Research MethodologyCoingecko’s research team excluded stablecoins and wrapped tokens in the study, and ranked cryptocurrencies by market cap. The final list was taken on May 8th. The study assumed tokens with no maximum supply had the same FDV as their market capitalization. The analytics reveal an interesting perspective on the current state of cryptocurrencies, exposing current trends and potential future trends within the crypto industry.

Harvest Global eyes mainland China for crypto ETF products | Cryptopolitan

Harvest Global Investments is eyeing an ambitious expansion into mainland China with its pioneering cryptocurrency ETFs, signaling a new era in investment opportunities bridging Hong Kong and the Chinese mainland.Harvest’s Strategic Vision for ETF ExpansionHarvest Global Investments, not just content with being one of the three issuers of Hong Kong’s first spot cryptocurrency ETFs, is plotting a future where mainland investors can directly access their Bitcoin and Ether products. This vision is articulated through their potential inclusion in the ETF Connect scheme.Launched in May 2022, this scheme allows mainland investors to engage with selected ETFs listed in Hong Kong, and is a component of the broader Stock Connect program that began back in 2014, initially linking the Hong Kong and Shanghai stock exchanges.Han Tongli, the CEO and chief investment officer of Harvest Global, conveyed on the sidelines of the Bitcoin Asia conference, the firm’s openness to applying for their ETFs, which invest directly in crypto tokens, to be part of this connect program.The caveat is, everything must proceed smoothly over the next two years. The integration of their crypto ETFs into this scheme could significantly elevate market confidence and introduce a vast new pool of investors to these emerging products.The Challenges and ProspectsDespite the potential for groundbreaking expansion, challenges loom large due to the Beijing authorities’ known reservations towards cryptocurrencies and financial innovation. Most commercial cryptocurrency activities are currently banned in mainland China, though the legality of trading and ownership by individuals still sparks debates.Nevertheless, Hong Kong’s crypto scene recently celebrated a milestone with the launch of its spot Bitcoin and Ether ETFs, the first in Asia. Despite their pioneering status, the launch was met with lukewarm trading volumes, starkly contrasting with the bustling ETF markets in the U.S.However, these products were touted for their unique approach, including in-kind subscriptions that allow purchasing ETFs directly with Bitcoin and Ether, with fund managers even waiving management fees temporarily to attract investors.The mixed reception to these ETFs highlights the hesitance and cautious approach many investors have towards Hong Kong’s commitment to becoming a regional crypto hub.During a panel at the Bitcoin Asia conference, Han expressed disappointment over the slow start but remains optimistic about the potential growth of the local market, stating that the Hong Kong market, which he views as more neutral with broader appeal in Asia, could eventually double the size of its American counterparts.As the city strives to establish a complete virtual asset ecosystem, Han foresees the local crypto ETFs flourishing to become the largest in trading volume in Hong Kong by year’s end. Harvest is also preparing to launch collateralized financial products based on these ETFs, further diversifying their offerings.The two-day Bitcoin Asia conference, which took place at the Kai Tak Cruise Terminal, highlighted these ETFs prominently. Legislative Council member Johnny Ng opened the event with enthusiastic remarks about the ETFs, calling them a major development in Hong Kong’s financial industry.Despite the second-largest first-day trading volume seen in these ETFs, with China Asset Management Company leading the pack, the journey ahead for Harvest Global and the broader ETF market in Hong Kong looks both promising and fraught with regulatory challenges.

‘Stand With Crypto’ Backs U.S. Politicians with Fundraiser Plan - DailyCoin


        
A U.S. crypto advocacy group has formed a political action committee.



The group aims to support crypto-friendly politicians.



Other crypto advocacy groups in the country have formed similar committees.
Coinbase’s digital asset advocacy group, Stand With Crypto, has revealed plans to raise money from its nearly half a million members in support of U.S.-based “crypto-friendly” politicians.Launched in August last year, the Stand with Crypto Alliance is a non-profit organization on a mission to champion clear, “common-sense’ regulation in the U.S. crypto industry. The group has 164,507 policymaker contacts and has donated over $86 million so far, raised from 448,317 crypto advocates.Rooting for Crypto-Friendly CandidatesOn March 10, Reuters reported that the advocacy group has formed a new Political Action Committee (PAC), whose aim is to support pro-crypto politicians in their pursuit of various positions in the House of Representatives and the Senate.
In addition to conducting a fundraiser for the politicians, the group made several direct endorsements, including Jim Justice, a Republican running for Senate in West Virginia, and Jim Banks, a Republican vying for Indiana’s Senate seat.Other endorsements from the group are Eddy Morales, a Democrat running to represent Oregon’s Third District; Troy Downing, a Republican running to represent Montana’s Second District; and Shomari Figures, a Democrat running to represent Alabama’s Second District.“The goal is to endorse candidates and support candidates that are protecting the rights of our advocates of Stand With Crypto throughout November.” The report quoted Nick Carr, chief strategist at Stand With Crypto.With the plan, the advocacy group joins other influential crypto-focused PACs in the U.S., such as Fairshake, Protect Progress, and Defend American Jobs, which have so far raised over $110 million in this election cycle, Reuters claimed.

Bots perform 90% of stablecoin transactions, Visa says

Photo: Dado Ruvic (Reuters)Nearly 90% of tracked stablecoin transactions are not human-involved. According to recent data published by Visa and blockchain data provider Allium, less than 10% of transactions are initiated by actual users, and most are done by bots. This means that only $149 billion out of the total of $2.2 trillion in stablecoin transactions recorded last month can be attributed to “organic” payments activity, per the analysis.Krispy Kreme's Q1 beat driven by heart donutsThe report cites May 5 as an example, when $51.6 billion worth of stablecoin transactions were processed, but only $4.6 billion was actual activity after removing inorganic transactions.Stablecoins are cryptocurrencies whose value is tied to that of another currency, or commodities like gold, or any financial instrument. With the new data dashboard, both companies are tracking transactions of major stablecoins, such as Tether, Circle’s USDC, Paxo’s USDP, and PayPal’s PYUSD. All these stablecoins are pegged to the U.S. dollar.Visa’s head of crypto, Cuy Sheffield, responded to a Coin Metrics chart that suggested stablecoins were catching up with established settlement networks. Sheffield said that transactions initiated by smart contracts, without human involvement, cannot be directly compared to traditional payment processor transactions.Stablecoins have been developed to address the high volatility associated with the most widely used cryptocurrencies. A currency must remain relatively stable to be used as a medium of exchange, thereby guaranteeing the parties involved that it will retain its purchasing power in the short term.For instance, Tether (USDT) is the top stablecoin that acts as a medium for investors to trade Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. Tether accounts for over 50% of the daily trading volume of Bitcoin and up to 70% of some other major cryptocurrencies.

The Cryptonomist

Binance and KuCoin have obtained registration from the anti-money laundering regulatory authority in India, marking a step forward for the credibility of cryptocurrencies. 
These two exchanges, among the nine that were banned in December, are the first offshore entities linked to cryptocurrencies to receive registration in India. 
The regulatory authority commented that these recordings give “a little more credibility to the system.” Let’s see all the details below. 

Anti-money laundering registration in India: Binance and KuCoin get the green light
Binance, the leading cryptocurrency exchange in the world, and its competitor KuCoin have become the first offshore entities related to cryptocurrencies to obtain approval from the Financial Intelligence Unit of India (FIU-IND), part of the Indian Ministry of Finance.
This happens months after both companies were banned for “operating illegally.” These two companies, along with Huobi, Kraken, Gate.io, Bittrex, Bitstamp, MEXC Global, and Bitfinex, had been excluded from India towards the end of last year.
The director of FIU-IND, Vivek Aggarwal, stated that the approval of Binance and KuCoin represents a positive signal for the credibility of cryptocurrencies in the country. 
Aggarwal also explained that the unit will establish a working group to review compliance guidelines on money laundering in the context of virtual digital asset services. 
He also emphasized that official recognition of the industry requires the support of the Indian parliament and government.
KuCoin was the first cryptocurrency exchange to pay a fine, paying 41,000 dollars, and has resumed its operations. On the other hand, Binance will have to attend a hearing with the FIU and pay a fine in order to resume its activities. 
According to the Economic Times, Binance may have to pay up to 2 million dollars. Vivek Aggarwal confirmed that Binance is registered, but the compliance process is not yet complete as the amount of the fine must be determined after the hearing.
Other entities like Kraken, Gemini, and Gate.io are in talks with the regulatory authority, while OKX and Bitstamp have submitted plans to exit the Indian market.
India now counts 48 cryptographic entities registered as reporting entities under the anti-money laundering law. 
The meeting with the press last Friday represented the first time that the FIU officially spoke about cryptocurrencies and follows a meeting between the FIU and the representatives of the 48 registered entities, also a novelty.
India’s ambiguity on crypto: from taxes to G20 global consensus
At the national level, India has maintained an ambiguous position on cryptocurrencies. 
In 2022, the high taxes imposed on digital assets, together with the crisis in the cryptocurrency markets, have pushed many Indian traders towards international exchanges. Damaging the local sector. 
However, trading volume has returned to Indian exchanges after the ban imposed on offshore entities.
During its presidency of the G20 in 2023, India pushed for a global consensus on the regulation of cryptocurrencies, managing to obtain the agreement of all members on the general guidelines. 
However, the country has been criticized for trying to obtain international consensus without having clear legislation on cryptocurrencies.
India has kept a cryptocurrency bill in cold storage since 2021 and indicated that it will decide its position in the coming months. 
A prominent legislator told CoinDesk that there probably won’t be any cryptocurrency bill before mid-2025.

Digital Currency Group Sees Revenue Rise Despite Grayscale Struggles - Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (BTC) Common Units of fractional undivided beneficial interest (ARCA:GBTC) - Benzinga

Digital Currency Group (DCG), the investment firm behind industry giant Grayscale, reported a strong first quarter with overall revenue climbing 11% to $229 million.What Happened: This positive performance comes despite ongoing challenges faced by Grayscale’s flagship product, the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust GBTC, Coindesk reported.“The first quarter of 2024 was marked by several exciting developments for our industry,” DCG said in a letter to shareholders, highlighting the approval of the long-awaited Bitcoin ETF and the surge in Bitcoin prices. “Against this backdrop, we are pleased to showcase a strong start to the year for DCG.”Grayscale Holds Steady Despite OutflowsGrayscale, a subsidiary of DCG, contributed $156 million to the company’s overall revenue. This figure remained relatively flat compared to the previous quarter, even amidst significant outflows from GBTC. The conversion of GBTC into a spot ETF in January opened the door for competition with lower fees, leading some investors to move their holdings elsewhere.“While Grayscale expected outflows alongside increased competition under the ETF wrapper, Q1 revenue attributable to GBTC nevertheless exceeded our expectations,” the company stated.Also Read: Bitcoin Spot ETFs Collect $11.29M Net Inflows On ThursdayThe Future Of GrayscaleOther DCG subsidiaries, however, painted a brighter picture. The cryptocurrency mining pool Foundry and the global investment platform Luno reported impressive revenue increases of 35% and 46%, respectively.The question remains: can Grayscale weather the storm? The company acknowledged the need to adjust its fees but has yet to implement those changes. To stay competitive, Grayscale has filed for a new Bitcoin ETF with a significantly lower fee structure, but its approval by the SEC is still pending.Looking Ahead: Benzinga’s Future Of Digital Assets EventThe future of Grayscale and the broader digital asset industry will undoubtedly be a hot topic at upcoming industry events. Benzinga’s  Future of Digital Assets conference, happening on Nov. 19, is one such platform where key players will gather to discuss the latest trends, regulations, and investment opportunities in the crypto space.Read Next: Joseph Lubin Accuses SEC Of Stifling Crypto Growth Amid Legal Showdown

Analyst Justin Bennett Says Bitcoin’s in a ‘Slow Bleed’ and on the Cusp of Plunging Further - Here Are His Targets - The Daily Hodl


								A widely followed crypto strategist believes Bitcoin (BTC) could suddenly plunge much lower.
In a new post, crypto analyst Justin Bennett tells his 111,300 followers on the social media platform X that if Bitcoin fails to hold $61,000 as support the crypto king could remain in a downtrend for a while.










However, he says that if Bitcoin can break through the $65,000 level on the monthly chart, the top digital asset by market cap would confirm a bullish trend.
“BTC looks pretty terrible at the moment. This slow bleed is not ideal for buying. We’ve seen this before, and it usually results in a cascade of long liquidations. Maybe this time is different. We’ll see. $61,000 is a must hold for bulls, $65,000 is monthly resistance.”
 
Source: Justin Bennett/X
Next up, the analyst says that Ethereum (ETH) against Bitcoin (ETH/BTC) is likely heading lower after failing to hold a key support level.
“Speaking of slow bleed, ETH/BTC has broken its 2017 diagonal on the weekly and monthly charts. Most likely a move into those 3.8-4% highs from here.”
Source: Justin Bennett/X
ETH/BTC is trading for 0.048 BTC ($3,019) at time of writing, up slightly in the last 24 hours.
Lastly, Bennett warns that Ethereum may follow a similar bearish price pattern as in July 2023 if the top altcoin fails to reclaim the $3,150 level on its weekly chart.
“This slow bleed from ETH doesn’t look great. Ethereum needs to recover $3,150 this week, or things could get dicier than they are. If you think a simple trend line doesn’t matter, check out July 2023.”
Source: Justin Bennett/X
Ethereum is trading for $3,017 at time of writing, up 1.5% in the last 24 hours.

Nvidia Earnings and OpenAI's Challenge Fuel AI Coins Surge


							

Bullish attitude dominates in the AI market, as seen by strong price increases for numerous AI currencies.



Semiconductor companies are driving AI coin rallies, with Nvidia’s earnings report and market optimism boosting the sector’s market cap by 10.4%.



OpenAI’s forthcoming search engine launch increases AI competition, signals innovation, and may raise investor confidence in projects involving AI.





Semiconductor businesses continue to fuel the artificial intelligence (AI) coin boom, boosted by Nvidia’s impending earnings report and a jump in AI market excitement. The AI market valuation, which is now $27.8 billion, has increased by 10.4% in the previous 24 hours.



Nvidia is anticipating release of its Q1 earnings statement on May 22 that may eventually favour the bullish trend of the AI market. Investors follow up the process, waiting for an upward trend in the blockchain-related equities, and the AI-based blockchain tokens will benefit from this.



In addition, a new stream on the path is also expected, which may boost the already bullish atmosphere around AI coins. As per sources, OpenAI, an AI research and deployment firm, has plans to release a search engine in the competition with Google on May 13. Consequently, the appearance of OpenAI in the field of Google competition harbors the possibility of a change in the search engine market.



The forthcoming introduction of OpenAI’s search engine is considered as an enormous advance in the AI commerce. As OpenAI expands into the field of AI-powered search, it not only increases competition but also represents the sector’s unwavering quest for innovation. This development is likely to boost investor confidence in AI-related ventures.



In the previous 24 hours, several AI currencies have seen huge price increases. Fetch.ai (FET) is currently at $2.34, with a market capitalization of $1.986B, representing an 8.84% growth in value. Render (RNDR) is up 11.83%, trading at $11.41, with a market capitalization of $4.435B. 



The Graph (GRT) has since increased by 18.51%, and is now trading at $0.311864 with a market capitalization of $2.957B. Furthermore, Bittensor (TAO) is today at $395.96, with a market capitalization of $2.668B, representing a 2.84% increase. 



Akash Network (AKT) has surged by 17.08%, priced at $5.73, with a market cap of $1.352B while SingularityNET (AGIX) has seen a 9.67% increase, trading at $0.980312, with a market cap of $1.256B.

Bitcoin Difficulty Sinks as Miners Mull Post-Halving Perks - DailyCoin


        
Bitcoin mining difficulty sees a significant percentage fall.



This suggests a consequential number of miners are leaving the network.



Runes and Ordinals activity has flatlined. 
The highly anticipated Bitcoin halving on April 19 ushered in a new era of scarcity for the network. By reducing the block reward from 6.25 to 3.125 BTC, the event made an already ruthlessly competitive mining landscape even more unforgiving. 
Miners were braced for tougher economics post-halving, but few could have predicted the current landscape. Three weeks out from the halving, evidence of miner capitulation has emerged as mining difficulty takes a significant dip.Bitcoin Miners Under PressureBitcoin mining difficulty fell by a significant 6% on May 10, dropping from 88.1 trillion hashes to 83.15 trillion hashes, per data from CoinWarz. This marked the largest percentage difficulty reduction since July 2021 when it plunged 28% to 14.36 trillion hashes. The mining difficulty metric automatically adjusts to account for changes in the total computing power of the BTC network.Bitcoin mining difficulty per CoinWarzBitcoin miners earn revenue from block rewards and transaction fees. After matching the target hash and successfully mining a new block, the miner receives the block reward in newly released BTC along with all fees paid by users to have their transactions included. With the halving cutting block rewards from 6.25 to 3.125 BTC, many assumed that increased transaction fees from Ordinals and the new Runes protocol would help offset the hit to block rewards. But that dynamic has yet to play out as daily mining revenue plummeted post-halving.Mining Revenue DownThe run-up to the halving saw daily mining revenue spike as high as $107.8 million, but the post-halving period has seen a sharp drop in revenue, sinking to $29.9 million as of May 9 to record a 29-week low, according to data from YCharts.Bitcoin daily mining revenue per YChartsThe severe drop in revenue underscored the squeeze on profitability that miners are facing in the aftermath of the halving event. Meanwhile, both Ordinals and Runes are currently failing to live up to the hype, subsequently adding to miners’ woes.Are Bitcoin Runes a Flop?The Runes protocol, which was created to bring meme coins to the base layer, was touted as the miners’ savior post-halving, as the expected surge in activity would drive up transaction fees. Yet shortly after their launch, on halving day, Dotta, the CEO of Forgotten Runes, conceded that the response had been lukewarm as the leading project “Satoshi Nakamoto” had less than 20,000 holders. Several weeks later, the situation for Runes has not improved. On-chain metrics showed a severe decrease in activity, falling from a peak of 23,061 on April 26 to just 43 by May 9, according to data from Dune. Similarly, fees earned from Runes fell from a peak of $321,263 on April 26 to just $719 on May 9.Runes activity per DuneAlthough Ordinals have had a head start on Runes, launching in January 2023, Ordinal activity has also fallen sharply since the halving, dropping to 15,333 on May 8, a fraction of what was seen at their November 2023 peak when daily inscriptions would number around the 480,000 mark, according to data from Dune. Daily fees generated by Ordinals came in at just 2.02 BTC on May 8.Ordinals activity per DuneWith Runes and Ordinals activity flatlining, Bitcoin miners are forced to fall back on standard transaction fees generated by users moving BTC.On the Flipside
BTC mining difficulty is a cumulative metric. Comparing a significant drop in 2021 (when the difficulty was around 20 trillion hashes) to a significant drop in 2024 is not a like-for-like comparison.



It would be unfair to call Runes a flop at this time, considering the protocol is just three weeks old.



Meme coin investing has developed an even worse reputation from the frequent rugs witnessed on other chains this cycle.
Why This MattersDeclining difficulty underscores Bitcoin miners’ challenges in the halving aftermath. As less profitable operations shut down, it paves the way for further consolidation of mining power among larger, more efficient players.Bitcoin miners are under pressure as daily revenue tanks:Bitcoin Mining Revenue Sinks Post-Halving: Are Miners Toast?Binance faces fresh allegations of market manipulation post-DoJ charges:Binance Whistleblower Alleges Profit Before User Protection

Coinbase’s Stand With Crypto launches political action committee

United States-based cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase’s project advocating for “common-sense” digital asset regulation has launched a political action committee (PAC).In a May 10 announcement on X, Coinbase’s Stand With Crypto project launched a PAC for roughly 450,000 members to contribute to candidates running in the 2024 U.S. elections. The initiative, launched by Coinbase in 2023, reported on its website that users had donated more than $86 million toward supporting pro-crypto initiatives in the country — it’s unclear how much, if any, these funds will go toward the PAC.“The goal is to endorse candidates and support candidates that are protecting the rights of our advocates of Stand With Crypto throughout November,” said Stand With Crypto Chief Strategist Nick Carr, according to a Reuters report.Source: Stand With CryptoSince its launch, the crypto advocacy group has hosted a forum for U.S. Presidential candidates — before Donald Trump was the presumptive Republican Party nominee — and campaigned for D.C. lawmakers to support crypto-friendly legislation. The project grades lawmakers running in 2024 on an A to F scale, with recommended candidates including Republican Bernie Moreno for Ohio’s Senate race and Democrat Shomari Figures for one of Alabama’s congressional seats.Election Day in the U.S. is roughly six months away, when voters will determine which political party controls the House of Representatives, the Senate, and the presidency. Crypto-focused PACs, including Fairshake and its affiliates, Defend American Jobs and Protect Progress, have raised more than $100 million to support candidates favoring digital asset policies. Related: Coinbase political initiative features US lawmaker who admitted to ethics violationsAmong the races with outspoken pro- and anti-crypto candidates includes the fight over the Massachusetts Senate seat currently held by Democrat Elizabeth Warren. Republican John Deaton, an attorney who has advocated for crypto users in several lawsuits, has pushed back against Senator Warren’s anti-crypto views while in office.“Eleven primary races that include crypto-backed candidates remain,” Rick Claypool, a researcher at Public Citizen, said in a May 6 X post. “Then it’s onto the general election, where narrow majorities mean super PAC spending can tip congressional control.”According to Federal Election Commission rules, individuals supporting a PAC are limited to donations of no more than $5,000, potentially giving Stand With Crypto up to $2.2 billion at its current membership. In contrast, Super PACs can accept unlimited contributions from corporations. Coinbase has donated millions to Fairshake and its affiliates.Magazine: Opinion: GOP crypto maxis almost as bad as Dems’ ‘anti-crypto army’

WIF's price - How long will this memecoin sustain its green streak? - AMBCrypto



WIF registered a massive surge in on-chain volume over the last few days
WIF’s social volume hiked too, despite the sentiment around the token falling

Dogwifhat [WIF] has been one of the market’s most popular memecoins over the last few months. As expected, this has translated into a hike in its volumes, with its network growing accordingly too.
Volumes on the rise
According to recent data, the on-chain volume on WIF grew significantly over the last 24 hours. This contributed to the memecoin surpassing other established networks in this domain.
Source: X
One of the reasons for this would be the ever-growing popularity of the WIF network. AMBCrypto’s examination of Santiment’s data revealed that the social volume around WIF has remained high over the past month. However, there was a trend observed that could impact WIF negatively in the social sphere.
Weighted sentiment, a metric used to determine the sentiment of the conversations being had on the social front for a token or a network, declined significantly over the past few days.
This meant that pessimism around WIF grew, affecting the token’s price negatively.
Source: Santiment
A look at the memecoin’s price
Since 01 April, after hitting the $4.857-level, the price of WIF declined significantly on the charts. Over this period, the price hit multiple lower lows and lower highs, establishing a bearish trend. However, the trend could reverse itself soon provided there is enough bullish momentum around WIF. The $3.502-level has been tested multiple times and has been weakened over the last week.
If this continues the price may be able to push past this resistance and aim for the $4.382-level in the future.
The CMF (Chaikin Money Flow) for WIF also fell significantly over the last few days. This indicated that the money flow for WIF had fallen materially.
However, the RSI (Relative Strength Index) for WIF sustained its uptrend, implying that the bullish momentum around WIF was relatively high.
Source: Trading View
Whales move in
Another factor that could affect WIF’s price would be whale behaviour. Based on lookonchain’s data, a whale recently invested 4.2 million USDC to purchase 1.4 million WIF tokens at a price of $2.99.
This whale, who has been trading WIF since early on, amassed a total profit exceeding $8 million from WIF transactions.

Shouldn't All These Crypto Lawyers Start Learning About Crypto?

Fortunately, as crypto-native associates become more senior, the dynamics within law firms are beginning to change. Truly adept "crypto lawyers" have emerged at many prestigious law firms, and there are lawyers at specialized boutiques who certainly know their stuff, but this phenomenon remains surprisingly rare. This shift is crucial, as lawyers who understand and can innovate within the framework of cryptocurrency law are critical for the industry's future.

Ethereum's Monetary Shift Post-Dencun: Insights from CryptoQuant | Cryptoglobe


                                
The Ethereum blockchain, a cornerstone of the decentralized finance (DeFi) ecosystem, has consistently grappled with scalability issues. Network congestion during periods of high activity leads to slow transaction times and exorbitant gas fees, hindering user experience and hindering the network’s ability to support a wider range of applications. The Dencun upgrade, deployed in March 2024, marked a significant step towards addressing these challenges, introducing novel concepts that lay the groundwork for a more scalable future for Ethereum.



Dencun, an amalgamation of the Cancun and Deneb upgrades, did not offer an immediate silver bullet solution. However, it represented a critical juncture in Ethereum’s development. The centerpiece of Dencun was the introduction of “proto-danksharding,” a concept that paves the way for future sharding implementation on the Ethereum network. Sharding essentially involves dividing the blockchain into partitions, or shards, each processing transactions independently. This parallel processing capability has the potential to significantly increase Ethereum’s transaction throughput. While Dencun itself does not implement sharding, it lays the technical foundation for its future integration.



While addressing long-term scalability was a core objective, Dencun’s impact on transaction fees in the immediate term was more nuanced. The upgrade did not directly reduce fees on the main Ethereum network. Instead, it focused on optimizing fees within Layer 2 networks. Layer 2 solutions operate on top of the Ethereum blockchain, bundling transactions together and processing them off-chain before transmitting them back to the mainnet. This approach helps alleviate congestion on the main Ethereum network and can potentially lower fees for users.



A key component of Dencun, EIP-4844, specifically reduced the cost for Layer 2 networks to submit their bundled transactions back to the main Ethereum blockchain. This improvement in Layer 2 efficiency has the potential to indirectly translate to lower fees for users who leverage these Layer 2 solutions. However, it is important to note that the realized fee reduction on Layer 2 networks may not be as significant as initial projections suggested, and the long-term impact on fees requires further observation.



The Dencun upgrade did have an unforeseen consequence. The success in lowering transaction fees also resulted in a decrease in the amount of ETH burned on the network. Previously, higher network activity corresponded to higher fees, and a portion of these fees were burned, leading to a deflationary effect on the total supply of ETH. This deflationary mechanism was one of the anticipated benefits of the Ethereum Merge, the transition from a proof-of-work to a proof-of-stake consensus mechanism. With a reduction in ETH burned and the natural increase in supply continuing, the total supply of ETH began to grow again at a faster rate compared to the period following the Merge. This shift has pushed ETH back towards an inflationary model.







            
            

            
            

            
            

        

The Dencun upgrade’s legacy is multifaceted. It demonstrably addressed scalability concerns and set the stage for a future Ethereum capable of handling a significantly higher transaction volume. However, the unintended consequence of potentially reversing ETH’s deflationary trend has ignited discussions about the future trajectory of Ethereum’s economic model.




VIDEO




The Dencun upgrade has prompted a fresh analysis from CryptoQuant, a respected South Korea-based blockchain analytics firm. This upgrade, according to CryptoQuant, may significantly alter Ethereum’s progression towards becoming an “ultra sound money” – a concept that denotes a currency that appreciates or maintains its value over time.



CryptoQuant explains that “ultra sound money” in the context of Ethereum refers to the blockchain’s potential to decrease its total ETH supply over time. They say this was being facilitated by strategic upgrades like EIP-1559 and The Merge, which introduced mechanisms to burn a portion of transaction fees. According to CryptoQuant, this feature was pivotal in reinforcing Ethereum’s deflationary economic model.



Post-Dencun upgrade, CryptoQuant notes a critical shift—there has been a decoupling of Ethereum’s transaction fees from network activity levels, which has effectively altered the ETH burn rate. While this has led to reduced transaction costs for users, CryptoQuant raises concerns that this adjustment challenges the deflationary mechanism previously set by The Merge. They emphasize that maintaining a deflationary supply now demands significantly higher network activity than before.



CryptoQuant articulates that the reduction in transaction fees, though beneficial for user adoption and network throughput, introduces inflationary pressures to the Ethereum ecosystem. They claim this shift could impact the long-term valuation of ETH, potentially affecting Ethereum’s attractiveness as a deflationary asset.

2 cryptocurrencies to reach $1 billion market cap in May


As May 2024 progresses, the cryptocurrency market is experiencing the ripple effects of the Bitcoin (BTC) halving event that took place in April—a key event often seen as a bullish catalyst for Bitcoin and the broader cryptocurrency landscape.
This positive sentiment is proving advantageous for several cryptocurrencies nearing significant market cap milestones, particularly the $1 billion mark. Despite the prevailing market trends, certain assets are showing strong potential for growth, supported by robust underlying fundamentals.
Building on this trend, Finbold has identified two cryptocurrencies poised to attract a substantial capital inflow in May 2024, potentially propelling them toward the $1 billion market cap milestone. Notably, these assets are already approaching this significant threshold.


Tezos (XTZ)
Tezos (XTZ), a blockchain platform known for its focus on security, decentralized governance, and scalability, is nearing a market cap of $910 million. Currently priced at $0.9277, marking a 4.50% increase over the last day, the ecosystem has shown notable activities.

Recently, the Tezos Foundation has partnered with Magic to enhance the onboarding process for decentralized applications (dApps). This will integrate Magic’s wallet solutions with the Tezos blockchain to improve user experiences, particularly by simplifying the processes for web3 applications.
Furthermore, Rarible, a key player in the digital marketplace space, is set to incorporate Tezos on its aggregated platform. This development underscores Tezos’ expanding influence and adoption in the NFT and broader digital asset markets.
Despite a challenging market environment, Tezos has shown resilience. According to CoinCodex, Tezos is expected to see a 6.54% price increase, potentially reaching around $1.020 by May 31. 
The Fear & Greed Index stands at 66, pointing to strong market interest in Tezos. Over the last 30 days, these indicators highlight its robust fundamentals and the strong support it continues to receive from its community and developers.
JasmyCoin (JASMY)
JasmyCoin (JASMY) , which integrates IoT and blockchain technologies to empower users with data sovereignty, is currently demonstrating promising growth with a market cap nearing $905 million and a price of $0.01836. 
JasmyCoin price and market cap. Source: CoinMarketCap
According to CoinCodex, the price of JasmyCoin is predicted to rise by 152% and reach $0.0474 by May 31. The technical indicators suggest a neutral current sentiment, while the Fear & Greed Index indicates a level of 66.
Both Tezos and JasmyCoin are aligned with broader market trends and are poised to benefit from any positive shifts in market sentiment.
These two cryptocurrencies are likely to attract increased investment if the cryptocurrency market regains its bullish momentum, pushing their market caps over the $1 billion threshold.

This Bull Run Might Skip Ethereum (ETH): Opinion


In an acerbic X post, Ethereum (ETH) veteran, prominent investor, podcaster and crypto educator Ryan Sean Adams describes two alternative midterm forecasts for Ether (ETH) as a crypto coin.Bearish: Inevitable puberty of Ethereum (ETH)In a 2024-2025 potential rally, Ethereum (ETH) might be overlooked by investors as it is going through the "awkward" phase of "puberty." It looks too slow and expensive compared to its own second-layer solutions of various types, Adams admits. While L2s are necessary for the scaling of such a blockchain and reflect the founder's vision of its progress, it has nothing to do with the interests of its most obvious investors.Meme coin champions and dApps users (including retroactive airdrop farmers) are too focused on alternative L2/L3 blockchains, while institutional "big money" is on its way to Bitcoin (BTC).The approval of Spot Ether ETFs in the U.S. might change the status quo but, as U.Today previously reported, analysts are skeptical of the possibility of this step in the coming months.As such, Ethereum (ETH) is getting through the challenges of its "puberty" while "toddler chains" are looking for shortcuts and, therefore, might look more attractive in the midterm.Bullish: Rock solid monetary economics for "chain of 1000 chains"At the same time, the arguments of Ethereum (ETH) optimists also look strong as of Q2, 2024. Ethereum (ETH) meets this cycle stronger than in 2020 with viable overhyped L2s and zkEVMs driving innovations and attracting value.With its "rock solid monetary economics" cemented by ERC 4337 implementation, it remains the only profitable blockchain, and its competitors are not even close to this status.Also, despite the growing audience of alternative blockchains, Ethereum (ETH) mainnet remains the root chain for 1,000 blockchains, Adams says.These two theses are just "two perspectives for ETH bulls," the author concludes.Ether (ETH) is changing hands at $2,925, being 3% down in the last 24 hours.

Aggressive Stock Buying On Rising Layoffs And Revenue Rise At The Largest Chip Manufacturer TSMC - Taiwan Semiconductor (NYSE:TSM) - Benzinga

To gain an edge, this is what you need to know today.Buying On Rising LayoffsPlease click here for an enlarged chart of SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust SPY which represents the benchmark stock market index S&P 500 (SPX).Note the following:
	The chart shows that the stock market has vigorously risen from the recent pullback.
	The chart shows that RSI reached oversold levels during the recent pullback and now has risen to touch the lower band of the overbought zone.  Historically, this setup leads to more stock market gains.
	The chart shows that the volume during the recent rise is not heavy.  This indicates lack of conviction.
	The chart shows that the stock market is now in the resistance zone.
	In The Arora Report analysis, stops of the short sellers are right above the resistance zone.  If the stock market rises further, Wall Street’s hunt and destroy algorithms will kick in, taking out the stops of short sellers and igniting a short squeeze. The result of such a scenario would be a new stock market high.  
	Yesterday in the Morning Capsule we shared with you:

Jobless claims came at 231K vs. 213K consensus. This indicates that the job market is beginning to slow.

	The bulls latched on to the rise in jobless claims and aggressively bought stocks. There is merit to this line of thinking because Powell is already itching to cut rates and rising layoffs will give him an excuse to cut rates.
	Prudent investors need to be somewhat careful as weekly jobless claims series is very volatile.
	For proper analysis at The Arora Report, in addition to the weekly data, we look at a four week moving average of initial jobless claims.  The four week moving average is now at 215K – up 2.26% from the prior week and down 10.14% from a year ago.  Considering the size of the U.S. economy, a rise of 2.26% over the prior week is hardly meaningful, but do not tell that to trigger happy stock market bulls.  Prudent investors should watch the trend over a period of several weeks, not just one week. Jobless claims is a leading indicator and carries heavy weight in The Arora Report adaptive ZYX Asset Allocation Model with inputs in ten categories. In plain English, adaptiveness means that the model changes itself with market conditions.  Please click here to see how this is achieved. One of the reasons behind The Arora Report’s unrivaled performance in both bull and bear markets is the adaptiveness of the model. Most models on Wall Street are static. They work for a while and then stop working when market conditions change.
	Adding to the optimism this morning is a report of rising revenues at the world’s largest chip manufacturer Taiwan Semiconductor Mfg. Co. Ltd. TSM. TSM is manufacturing a vast majority of the artificial intelligence chips, and the data shows sales are booming.  Here are the details:
	
		April revenues came at T$236.02B.  This is up 59.6% year-over-year and up 21% month-over-month.
		January - April revenue came at T$828.67B. This is 26% year-over-year.
	
	
	Data from TSM is bringing buying into artificial intelligence stocks such as NVIDIA Corp NVDA, Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. AMD, Micron Technology Inc MU, and Applied Materials, Inc. AMAT.

Based on individual risk preference, consider a protection band consisting of cash or Treasury bills or short-term tactical trades as well as short to medium term hedges and short term hedges. This is a good way to protect yourself and participate in the upside at the same time.You can determine your protection bands by adding cash to hedges. The high band of the protection is appropriate for those who are older or conservative. The low band of the protection is appropriate for those who are younger or aggressive. If you do not hedge, the total cash level should be more than stated above but significantly less than cash plus hedges.A protection band of 0% would be very bullish and would indicate full investment with 0% in cash. A protection band of 100% would be very bearish and would indicate a need for aggressive protection with cash and hedges or aggressive short selling.It is worth reminding that you cannot take advantage of new upcoming opportunities if you are not holding enough cash. When adjusting hedge levels, consider adjusting partial stop quantities for stock positions (non ETF); consider using wider stops on remaining quantities and also allowing more room for high beta stocks.  High beta stocks are the ones that move more than the market.Traditional 60/40 PortfolioProbability based risk reward adjusted for inflation does not favor long duration strategic bond allocation at this time.Those who want to stick to traditional 60% allocation to stocks and 40% to bonds may consider focusing on only high quality bonds and bonds of seven year duration or less. Those willing to bring sophistication to their investing may consider using bond ETFs as tactical positions and not strategic positions at this time.The Arora Report is known for its accurate calls. The Arora Report correctly called the big artificial intelligence rally before anyone else, the new bull market of 2023, the bear market of 2022, new stock market highs right after the virus low in 2020, the virus drop in 2020, the DJIA rally to 30,000 when it was trading at 16,000, the start of a mega bull market in 2009, and the financial crash of 2008.

Tether (USDT) Warning from Deutsche Bank! - Bitcoin Sistemi


The largest stablecoin Tether (USDT) is the largest cryptocurrency after Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) with a market value of $110 billion.
While Tether is strengthening its position day by day, Deutsche Bank warned investors against all stabalecoins, including Tether.


Stating that they examined approximately 334 stablecoins in a recent report, Deutsche Bank analysts pointed out that only 14% of them have survived so far.

“Some stablecoins may survive, but most will likely fail.
The enduring success of stablecoins relies on reliability, reserve support and tight operational controls. But these qualities are currently missing from many major stablecoins.
So the 30 percent de-peg among some stablecoins is not surprising at all. “

Stating that all stablecoins are unstable due to lack of transparency and strong support, analysts also warned investors against the leading stablecoin Tether.





Pointing to Tether's track record regarding misleading statements regarding reserve stocks, analysts reminded that Tether received a total fine of $41 million from the CFTC.
Analysts also said that recently published reports stated that Tether (USDT) remains the stablecoin most used in criminal activities.


Deutsche Bank analysts recently stated that their criticism of all stablecoins, including Tether (USDT), stems from the collapse of Terraform Labs' algorithmic stablecoin TerraUSD (TUSD) in 2022 and the removal of at least 40 billion dollars from the market in a few days.

StaFi Adds Eigenlayer’s Liquid Restaking Token (LRT) To Its Liquid Staking As A Service (LSaaS) Stack



                    

StaFi, one of the leading staking infrastructure providers, announced support for EigenLayer’s Liquid Restaking Token (LRT), allowing users to participate in the restaking ecosystem. Users on StaFi can now rehypothecate their staked tokens to provide security to decentralized applications (DApps) that are required to build their trust and security – or their own actively validated services (AVS). 



Eigenlayer LRT is already supported on the LSaaS Stack App, while support for Karak and BounceBit LRT will be maintained. There are also plans to roll out support for BTC LRT in the future.




The latest integration follows the launch of StaFi’s liquid staking as a service (LSaaS )testnet – launched last month – and the publication of the StaFi 2.0 roadmap. The roadmap included plans to add the LRT stack to power new re-staking applications. EigenLayer also launched on mainnet in February this year allowing developers to leverage pooled security via restaking by extending the security of Ethereum to AVSs. 







The integration of the LRT stack will enable project teams and DApp developers to seamlessly deploy LRT on LSaaS, significantly enhancing the efficiency of LRT development and overall accessibility of restaking.



Terming the latest addition to LSaaS as a “major breakthrough for developers”, Liam Young, the founder of StaFi stated: 




“The integration of LRT into StaFi’s Liquid Staking as a Service is a major breakthrough for developers, who are now free to create restaking products that harness shared security across multiple chains. Up until now, building with LRT has been a complex task that entails significant lead time. StaFi’s LRT Stack will slash time to market while empowering builders to create novel solutions that draw upon the crypto economic guarantees that liquid staking permits.” 



EigenLayer is a protocol built on Ethereum that permits restaking to enhance overall security across the blockchain ecosystem. The platform introduces novel ideas such as staking and free market governance that create an optimized system of pooled security whereby the staked $ETH is repurposed to provide validation services to AVSs. 



Simply, EigenLayer repurposes currently staked ETH (or another token)  to provide validation services to AVSs via restaking. The staked ETH is repurposed to validate transactions to platforms built on Ethereum but cannot utilize the settlement layer of the blockchain. Crucially, stakers retain their staking rewards on Ethereum. 



The integrated LRT stack will support several functionalities such as restaking, unrestaking, and withdrawing tokens. Additionally, users will be able to mint and burn LRTs, join restaking pools and delegate and undelegate staking operators. 








To facilitate the LRT/ETH pair construction, AVS restaking rewards will be swapped for ETH in the market via swap. This will follow the launch of EigenLayer’s planned upgrade which will allow developers and  LRT operators to construct their LRT with the aforementioned functionalities swiftly.

Cardano (ADA) is currently showing signals of bullish potential as it posts a "golden cross" formation on its hourly charts. This development has sparked anticipation among traders and investors, prompting speculation about the potential trajectory of ADA's price in the near term.A golden cross occurs when a shorter-term moving average, typically the 50-hour moving average, crosses above a longer-term moving average, such as the 200-hour moving average, on a price chart. This crossover is interpreted by technical analysts as a bullish signal, suggesting a potential uptrend in the asset's price.In the case of Cardano, the recent bullish crossover on its hourly charts might suggest a shift in momentum toward the upside. This bullish formation reflects increasing buying pressure and suggests that ADA's price could be poised for significant upward movement in the coming days.ADA/USD Hourly Chart, Courtesy: TradingViewHowever, it is important to note that while golden crosses can provide valuable insights into market sentiment and potential price trends, they are not foolproof indicators and should be considered in conjunction with other technical and fundamental factors.ADA was up 0.59% in the last 24 hours at the time of writing to $0.4575, having pared its intraday gains. ADA fell drastically on its hourly chart, forming a giant red candlestick at press time. Weekly initial jobless claims rose to their highest level since August 2023, impacting the financial markets with the U.S. inflation data for April due next week. As Cardano's community eagerly awaits further developments on the market, all eyes are on the charts to see if ADA can capitalize on the bullish golden cross and sustain its upward momentum. A breakout above key resistance levels could potentially signal a new bullish phase for ADA, while failure to maintain momentum could result in selling pressure.In this regard, a break above $0.684 might kickstart a fresh uptrend for ADA's price; on the other hand, if selling persists, the $0.4 level may act as a formidable support.

XRP Price: 'Sleeping Giant' About to Awaken, Expert Predicts


According to Evai CEO Matthew Dixon, the upcoming consumer price index (CPI) report, which is set to be released on May 15, could end up awakening the "sleeping giant" that could propel the price of the XRP cryptocurrency much higher. A weaker-than-expected CPI reading is expected to be a major bullish catalyst for the token. At press time, XRP is changing hands at $0.5056 after peaking at $0.5217 earlier today. Dixon has predicted that the price of the Ripple-affiliated token could end up surpassing the $0.6 level later this month. The main U.S. stock indexes seem to be on track to record their eighth consecutive day in a row following some dovish statements made by Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell. As reported by U.Today, Powell dismissed the stagflation concerns that had plagued the markets in April, pushing the Bitcoin price to as low as the $56,000 level. Analysts expect a 0.3% CPI increase next Wednesday. However, a lower-than-expected reading will be a boon for risk assets, which include major altcoins such as XRP.As reported by U.Today, cryptocurrency bull Tom Lee recently predicted a dramatic inflation drop. The Fundstrat cofounder sees inflation declining substantially in the second half of the year. This, he believes, could eventually propel the Bitcoin price to $150,000 this year.  XRP has been severely underperforming Bitcoin this year despite Ripple's partial win in 2023. The lawsuit is finally approaching its much-anticipated conclusion, but it is not clear whether this will be a bullish catalyst for the token this year.

Shiba Doge Hybrid to Surge 8,000% as MEXC Listing Announced, While Shiba Inu and Dogecoin Struggle



                    

Shiba Doge Hybrid (SHIDOGE) could turn early investors into multi-millionaires if it becomes a mainstream coin, like Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE).



Shiba Doge Hybrid (SHIDOGE), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is poised to explode over 8,000% in price in the coming days.




This is because SHIDOGE has announced its first centralized exchange listing, which will be on MEXC.



This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up.



Currently, Shiba Doge Hybrid (SHIDOGE) can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jupiter and Raydium, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days.




Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Shiba Doge Hybrid (SHIDOGE) could become the next viral memecoin.



To buy Shiba Doge Hybrid on Raydium or Jupiter ahead of the MEXC listing, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for SHIDOGE by entering its contract address – 797CmcxqkLZaSjMd7MdyNZ9swuSzaGdYWkJ65jehiXWa – in the receiving field.



In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price.



If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner.




The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum.



This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like SHIDOGE.

Crypto Analyst Sets $10 Price Target For Cardano As Volume Jumps 90%


																The stars may be finally aligning for Cardano (ADA) and its holders, as the crypto token recently experienced a significant reversal and a jump in its trading volume. Interestingly, this development coincides with an ultra-bullish prediction that a crypto analyst made for the crypto token. 
Crypto Analyst Predicts Cardano To Rise To $9
Crypto analyst Altcoin Daily revealed in an X (formerly Twitter) post that $9 is their peak price target for Cardano in this bull run. The analyst joins other crypto analysts who have made ultra-bullish predictions for Cardano despite how low the crypto token is currently trading. Before now, Dan Gambardello, the founder of Crypto Capital Venture, had predicted that Cardano could rise to as high as $11 in this bull run.
Related Reading: CryptoQuant CEO Predicts Where Bitcoin Price Is Headed, Is $265,000 Too Ambitious?
Meanwhile, crypto expert Jason Appleton predicted that Cardano will rise to as high as $32 in this bull run. Specifically, he mentioned that this will happen at the peak of this market cycle. Altcoin Daily’s prediction comes amidst Cardano’s 90% jump in trading volume. This suggests that more investors are accumulating the crypto token ahead of this parabolic rise. 
Cardano’s price already reacted positively to this development, with the crypto token seeing a reversal from its downtrend. Crypto analyst Trend Rider suggested that this reversal might begin an upward trend for Cardano as he noted that the crypto token was currently holding its support level very well. 
The analyst also revealed that the bears were currently trying to push the crypto token further down, but he claimed that they would get tired once Cardano could hold this support for 1 to 2 more weeks. Once that happens, Carano will bounce from its current price level, Trend Rider remarked. 
Making A Bull Case For ADA
Crypto analyst Ali Martinez recently made a bullish case for Cardano. He mentioned in an X post that the crypto token seems ready for a parabolic bull run. Martinez alluded to Cardano’s historical trend and explained why the 50% price drop the crypto token experienced this past month might be a good buying opportunity. 
Martinez claimed that Cardano consolidated within a parallel channel in 2019, signaling an end to the bear market. Following that “stagnant phase,” ADA is said to have broken out of the channel with a 75% surge and then experienced a 56% correction, setting the stage for its 4,095% price gain in that bull run. 
Related Reading: Bitcoin Whales Lose Interest, Is This A Precursor For A Crash To $50,000?
Martinez further noted that a similar situation looks to be playing out again as Cardano has consolidated within a parallel channel, marking an end to the bear market. ADA then broke out of this channel with a 72% price surge following this period of stagnation. Now, Cardano has experienced a 50% price correction, just like in 2019, which Martinez remarked could be setting the stage for “an impressive bull run ahead.”

Robinhood CEO Says His Firm Met With the U.S. SEC 16 Times in ‘Good Faith’ Ahead of Crypto-Related Wells Notice - The Daily Hodl


								The CEO of popular retail trading platform Robinhood says his firm and the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) were engaged in discussions before the regulator issued a Wells Notice.
In a new interview on CNBC, Vlad Tenev says that Robinhood met with the SEC several times to address issues with existing securities laws and regulatory frameworks that do not account for crypto assets before the regulatory body gave any notice that it planned to take enforcement actions.










“We tried to create what’s called the special purpose broker-dealer for the purpose of transacting crypto assets. We actually came in good faith to meet with the SEC. I think we met with them 16 times and, unfortunately, that was not reciprocated.”
Tenev says the securities watchdog is not interested in pursuing discussions about the subject.
“It’s hard to impute the reasoning behind that, but they told us they did not want to keep meeting about it and they did not see a path toward it.”
He says the SEC has the power to address crypto restrictions but the regulator simply refuses to make changes.
“The SEC has the ability to change the rules to allow for brokers to accommodate crypto assets and they do not seem intent on doing that. Rather they are proceeding with regulation by enforcement and that is disappointing.”
Tenev previously said that Robinhood is prepared to contest the SEC’s charges in court if the legal action pushes through. He now explains why the trading platform is taking a stand against the regulator.
“I did not want to have to get into this situation but we have to defend ourselves and advocate for our customers. We do believe that crypto assets are becoming more and more important and it would not be acceptable for us to not have Americans have access to them.”

Trump holds on to crypto as his new campaign strategy against Biden

Recently, a political-crypto gathering of supporters took place at Mar-a-Lago, hosted by former President Donald Trump. The event was exclusive to traders who purchased over 47 of the Trump Digital Trading Cards “Mugshot Edition” NFTs, that were valued at $99 per card. After the dinner, Trump delivered a brief speech on crypto, which was later recorded and shared on X.Trump turns to crypto as a weapon against the Biden administrationDuring a gathering at Mar-a-Lago, Trump urged crypto supporters to cast their vote in his favor, citing the Biden administration’s stringent regulatory measures imposed on the industry.The Democrats are very much against it [crypto]. And I say this, a lot of people are very much for it … and I’m fine with it. I want to make sure it’s good and solid … but I’m good with it. If you like crypto in any form, and it comes in a lot of different forms, you better vote for Trump.
Donald TrumpThe change in Trump’s approach towards the crypto community is a significant shift from his previous criticisms, although it was somewhat was expected. Republicans have shown growing support for bitcoin and other digital assets in recent years, while some Democrats continue to debate whether to recognize the industry following a series of scandals.Trump’s endorsement is a significant development for crypto entities that have been actively lobbying in Washington and investing substantial amounts of money to shape the outcome of the 2024 elections.Trump also mentioned that NFTs have gained popularity once again, which was met with enthusiasm from his supporters.These statements indicate a significant shift in position since 2021 when Trump expressed concerns about the potential risks of crypto and stated that he was not supportive of it.Furthermore, this position is more assertive than his previous viewpoint. During a Fox News town hall in February 2024, Trump acknowledged the need for regulation. He stated that, “You probably have to do some regulation. But many people are embracing it. More and more I’m seeing people wanting to pay Bitcoin, and you’re seeing something that’s interesting, so I can live with it one way or the other.”Biden’s administration handle on cryptoOn the same day, Biden made it clear that he would veto a resolution aimed at repealing a Securities and Exchange Commission accounting policy.The SEC policy, known as Staff Accounting Bulletin No 121 or SAB 121, adds the costs for financial institutions that hold digital assets in custody. The tax proposal introduced by Biden has sparked controversy within the DeFi ecosystem. This is because it would impose a 30% excise tax on the electricity costs of BTC miners.“Gensler is very much against it,” Trump said on Wednesday regarding the administration’s current stand on crypto. “The Democrats are very much against it.”However, there are Democrats who support the proposed bill. On that note, 21 Democrats broke ranks with President Biden’s veto threat and sided with Republicans in voting for a resolution to overturn the SEC’s crypto guidance.It seems that memecoins are benefiting from the age-old adage that any kind of publicity is good publicity – especially the bad. Even the most insignificant form of publicity.The crypto token Jeo Boden (BODEN) experienced a significant surge of up to 25% on Wednesday. This increase in value came after former President Donald Trump responded to a question from one of his supporters regarding the token.After reaching its highest point at $0.42, BODEN experienced fluctuations and is currently trading at $0.28, representing a decrease of over 19%.The Trump campaign is currently not accepting crypto donations, but he mentioned at the impromptu gathering that he plans to do so.When asked about the possibility of accepting donations in crypto, the likely Republican nominee confidently assured, “If you can’t, I’ll make sure you can.”

Stocks Pause On Dismal Consumer Confidence; Yields, Dollar Rise As Inflation Expectations Kick Higher, Bitcoin Sinks: What's Driving Markets Friday? - Arista Networks (NYSE:ANET) - Benzinga

A worse-than-expected University of Michigan’s May consumer report halted stock gains on Friday, sparking worries about a potential decline in consumer health amid perceived rising price pressures.The report disclosed that both near-term and long-term inflation expectations have surged beyond projections this month, causing the broader consumer gauge to hit its lowest levels in six months.“If spending slows down and inflation increases, we'll get the opposite of the Goldilocks scenario that many were hoping for, and the Fed will be in an especially difficult position of choosing between accommodating a slowing economy and fighting increasing inflation expectations,” said Chris Zaccarelli, chief investment officer for Independent Advisor Alliance. Echoing this view, Jeffrey Roach, chief economist for LPL Financial, sees rising risks of stagflation, a concern that could unsettle markets. At 12:05 p.m. trading in New York, the S&P 500 was 0.1% lower, but it was firmly up by 1.6% for the week, poised to secure a third consecutive week of gains after three of losses.The Dow Jones Industrial Average was a tad higher, battling to secure the eight straight session of gains, the longest positive streak since December 2023. Tech stocks were flat. Small caps were the underperformers, with the iShares Russell 2000 ETF IWM down 0.9%. The rising inflation perceptions in the consumer survey rescued the dollar, which eyes a positive weekly close, after two negative ones. Treasury yields also inched higher by about 4 basis points across all maturities. The 10-year benchmark hit 4.50%.Gold surged to $2,385/oz, with the SPDR Gold Trust GLD up 0.8%.

Cardano (ADA) Eyes Crazy Anomaly with 4,000,000% Surge in Bulls Liquidations


In an unexpected turn of events within the crypto market, Cardano (ADA) has experienced an extraordinary surge in bullish liquidations, diverging significantly from the bearish ones. Over the course of just one hour, there has been a remarkable $320,670 liquidated from long positions, a figure that dwarfs the comparatively small $8.97 liquidated from short positions, resulting in an astonishing disparity of nearly 4,000,000%.Source: CoinGlassThe surge in bullish liquidations coincided with a 3% decline in Cardano's price within the same hour. One major contributing factor could be named recent negative macroeconomic indicators from the US economy. Among these indicators, the Michigan Consumer Sentiment Index dropped from 77.2 to 67.4, reflecting a decrease in consumer confidence. Additionally, consumer inflation expectations saw an uptick, with 1-year expectations rising from 3.2% to 3.5%, and 5-year expectations increasing from 3% to 3.1%.ADA to USD by CoinMarketCapThe Michigan Consumer Sentiment Index serves as a gauge of consumer sentiment regarding economic conditions, with lower values indicating reduced confidence, which can impact spending patterns. Meanwhile, the rise in inflation expectations suggests that consumers anticipate higher prices for goods and services in the future, potentially leading to changes in spending behavior and economic dynamics.This combination of economic factors may have influenced market sentiment, contributing to the surge in liquidations observed in Cardano trading. However, the fact that long liquidations exceeded shorts by 4,000,000% is obviously due to excessive greed reigning the market.

Anatoly Yakovenko Previews Solana Post-Firedancer - The Defiant

Solana’s co-founder says there the network faces an opportunity to emerge as the leading monolithic chain in web3.In a panel closing out the first day of the Solana Crossroads 2024 conference, Anatoly Yakovenko, the CEO of Solana Labs, said that Solana is poised to emerge as the leading web3 network.Yakovenko said Solana will have officially transcended its “mainnet beta” with the impending launch of Firedancer — the forthcoming Solana client from Jump Crypto. Firedancer offers an entirely new codebase intended to eliminate the risk posed by Solana’s currently lone client implementation, increase transaction throughput, and bolster the network’s efficiency.“Folks can stop calling it beta at any time, it's just my personal preference that we do that after Firedancer ships,” Yakovenko said. “You want different people to work on the same component so the probability of a bug being in both [clients] is virtually zero.”Yakovenko said that Jump has been “making a ton of progress” on Firedancer, adding that he expects there is a 50% chance Firedancer will be live on mainnet before the Solana Breakpoint conference in September.Jump Crypto first announced it was building Firedancer in August 2022. Jump said it would design the client to “drastically increas[e] Solana’s networking throughput, resiliency, and efficiency.”Despite Solana currently boasting an impressive throughput, the network struggled with frequent outages and perceptions of centralization in recent years.Memecoin stress-testingLooking ahead, Yakovenko predicts that Solana will grow to host more than $1 trillion worth of stablecoins within the next five years.He characterized the challenges as bottlenecks Solana has faced leading up to this point as “a blessing,” as memecoins, NFTs, and inscriptions have served to stress-test the network, rather than a massive stablecoin ecosystem.“We’re blessed to stress-test with memecoins, and not with $1 trillion worth of stablecoins,” Yakovenko said. “We’re lucky to find those bugs and fix them.”Yakovenko also reaffirmed Solana’s commitment to achieving scalability at Layer 1, as opposed to the "fragmented" Layer 2 ecosystem driving Ethereum’s scalability. He said Solana’s design is intended to facilitate future scalability gains through gains in hardware efficiency, noting the rapid pace of innovation in semiconductor manufacturing from the likes of Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company and Nvidia.“This is an opportunity for a single giant world computer that synchronizes at the speed of light, Yakovenko said.

Binance VIP trader profited by dumping play-to-earn token | Protos


A new investigation has revealed that Binance allegedly helped a secretive whale trader siphon money from the play-to-earn crypto industry. One of these so-called VIPs was DWF, afforded special attention by Binance. DWF allegedly bragged that it “successfully” tripled the trading volume of a token through an artificial, “believable trading pattern.”
Some investigators estimated that DWF manipulated the price of YGG and at least six other tokens on Binance through at least $300 million worth of wash trades last year.
Not too long ago, venture capitalists at Andreessen Horowitz (a16z) told the world a story about play-to-earn crypto. Web 3 and the metaverse would become so large and prosperous that they would spawn a new, sustainable industry for offshore labor. As the result of just one crypto game, a16z wrote, “Gaming was literally lifting an entire community out of poverty.”
In these venture capitalists’ imagined reality, wealthy Westerners would crave billions of dollars of in-game items like pets, outfits, weapons, or virtual real estate. They would pay low income workers to perform time-consuming in-game actions to earn those items on their behalf. 
Even more amazing, this type of activity would become so commonplace and lucrative for both groups that the wealthy class would self-organize into play-to-earn guilds in order to use the power of blockchain to govern, lend, and distribute their assets.
Cheerleading the play-to-earn crypto revolution that never happened
The game was Axie Infinity, which sold a massive collection of NFTs plus two fungible tokens, AXS and SLP. As a result of this proof-of-concept game, “many players in the Philippines were earning more than they had at their previous jobs,” the venture capitalists boasted.
To invest in this amazing future, a16z decided to invest millions into Axie Infinity’s game studio. (Initially it wanted to lead a $150 million round yet only closed a small fraction of that total.) It also poured $4.6 million (plus millions more in tokens) into an Axie Infinity play-to-earn guild, Yield Guild Games (YGG).
A16z wrote that YGG would provide ‘”unparalleled economic opportunities” and unlock a “largely untapped economic opportunity in emerging markets to provide jobs by building a virtual economy in the digital world.”

Today, the price of AXS is down 95% from its all-time high, SLP is down 99%, Axie NFTs are down 90% on average, and YGG is down 92%. DWF made millions by selling millions of YGG near the peak, according to Wall Street Journal’s investigation.
The real story of play-to-earn crypto, it seems, is the money that has already been made from selling a dream of the future that never transpired.

3 High-Growth Tech Stocks that Also Pay Dividends Now - Tokenist


					
Neither the author, Tim Fries, nor this website, The Tokenist, provide financial advice. Please consult our website policy prior to making financial decisions.



Investors are used to certain types of stocks to yield worthwhile dividends. These are typically real estate investment trusts (REITs), banks, payment processors, large utility or consumer staple companies. In contrast, high-growth companies like Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) tend to reinvest in the business.



Soon after Texas Instruments (NASDAQ: TXN), Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) experimented with dividends from 1987 to 1995, only to stop until reissuing in 2012. Although AAPL dividend yield is still low at 0.54%, the company uses a proxy shareholder return via record-breaking stock buybacks.



According to Morningstar, compared to the financial services sector, which comprised 43% of dividend growth in 2003, the tech sector only constituted 2.10%. By 2023, we are seeing much greater sector diversification, with financial firms making 23.57% while dividend-paying tech stocks increased to 9% share.



Meta Platforms (NASDAQ: META) and Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOGL) announced dividend payouts this year. This marks a wider tech industry shift to keep their stock momentum going by enticing a wider investor base to enroll.



Here are three established tech stocks that investors should consider for dividend payouts.



Qualcomm (NASDAQ: QCOM) – 1.77% dividend yield at $3.20 annual payout per share



Year-to-date, this chipmaker and holder of many licensed tech patents significantly outperformed AMD (NASDAQ: AMD) at 30% vs. 9.50% returns, respectively. While AMD started slipping in early March, QCOM stock gained 20% value in the last three months. 



At the present price level of $180.54, QCOM shares are 44% above the 52-week low of $101.47 per share. Qualcomm dominates the global smartphone application processor (AP) shipments even more so than Apple. As of Q4 2023, the company holds a 23% share, behind MediaTek’s 36% and ahead of Apple’s 20% share, per Counterpoint Research.



In the second half of 2024, Qualcomm is set to launch new Snapdragon 8S Gen3 and 7 Plus Gen 3 mobile platforms, harnessing AI power to the flagship smartphone sector. For Q2 2024, the company reported strong earnings. Net income increased 14% year-over-year with notable automotive division revenue growth of 35% to $603 million. 



Compared to net cash from operations of $4.5 billion in 2023, Qualcomm increased it to $6.5 billion. For Q3 FY24, the company set an outlook revenue of $8.8 – $9.6 billion range, from Q2’s $9.4 billion. Accordingly, Nasdaq’s forecast sees a modest average price target of $187.05 vs the current $180.54 per share.





Meta Platforms (NASDAQ: META) – 0.42% dividend yield at $2 annual payout per share



Declared the winner of Magnificent Seven earnings in February, Meta announced its first-ever quarterly dividend in Q4 2023 earnings, to be paid on March 26th, 2024. Like Apple, Meta used a dual approach to boosting shareholder returns, authorizing $50 billion worth of stock buybacks.



Year-to-date, META stock is up 36%. From its 52-week low of $235.33, its price is now $475.42. Mark Zuckerberg spread his company across multiple pies, effectively dominating the VR/AR sector with Oculus Quest headsets, while Meta’s metaverse division Reality Labs is yet to produce profits.



Nonetheless, Meta’s deep pockets from online advertising across social media platforms, significantly boosted with AI tools, give the company ample space for R&D to continue as a metaverse stock. For Q1 2024, Meta reported 27% year-over-year revenue growth to $36.4 billion, delivering a 117% increase in net income of $12.3 billion.



In other words, Meta occupies many attractive niches for investors—blue chip, growth tech, metaverse, and now dividend stock with generous stock buybacks to boot. Nasdaq’s average price target for META is $522.49 vs. the current $475.42 per share.







Salesforce (NASDAQ: CRM) – 0.58% dividend yield at $1.60 annual payout per share



Salesforce cornered the market on cloud-based customer relationship management (CRM) with an estimated 26.47% market share. For comparison, all other CRM platforms have under 6% shares, including Microsoft Dynamics CRM, which has 4.29%. 



These services are typically subscription-based, giving Salesforce a stable and predictable revenue stream. The company announced its first-ever dividend in February, with the payment date on April 11th, at a quarterly cash of $0.40 per share.



In February, Salesforce released its Q4 2024 (fiscal) earnings, showing 11% year-over-year revenue growth to $9.29 billion and full-year net income of $4.1 billion vs. $208 million the year prior. In addition to the new dividend inflow, Salesforce authorized a $10 billion share repurchase program, having returned $11.7 billion to shareholders since inception.



For full-year FY25 guidance, Salesforce gave 8% – 9% year-over-year revenue growth up to $38 billion. Year-to-date, CRM stock gained 7.4% value. Nasdaq’s average price target for CRM shares is now $339.32 vs the current $275.30 per share.

JUST IN: Wells Fargo, the Third Largest Bank in the US, Makes a Giant Bitcoin Push - Bitcoin Sistemi


Wells Fargo, the third-largest bank in the United States, disclosed its investment in spot Bitcoin ETFs in a recent filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).
The bank's investment portfolio now includes Grayscale's spot BTC ETF, ProShares Bitcoin Strategy futures ETF and Bitcoin Depot Inc. has shares.


Spot BTC ETFs have gained popularity among institutional investors as they provide exposure to Bitcoin's price movements without the need for direct ownership of the asset. This makes them a more regulated and safer investment vehicle for Bitcoin (BTC).

This development comes alongside a widespread trend towards institutional adoption of Bitcoin. Many major banks and financial institutions are exploring ways to include Bitcoin in their offerings and gain exposure to the asset.





Earlier this week, Susquehanna International Group, a global trading and technology firm, disclosed in an SEC filing that it holds $1.8 billion in spot BTC and other Bitcoin ETFs.
BTC Spot ETFs were launched on January 10 and have been on the agenda of the cryptocurrency market since then.

Bitcoin To $1.3M By 2028? Questionable, Says 10x Research - Benzinga

Bitcoin BTC/USD bulls hoping for a seven-figure price by 2028 may be disappointed, according to a new report by 10x Research. What Happened: The report, authored by Markus Thielen, questions the validity of the Stock-to-Flow (STF) model in predicting future Bitcoin prices.“The STF model predicted a price of $110,793 for Bitcoin in the last cycle, which clearly didn’t happen,” Thielen states in the report. “This casts doubt on its ability to accurately forecast future prices, particularly the ambitious $1.3 million projection for the current cycle.”STF Model Under ScrutinyThe STF model, often used by Bitcoin proponents, compares the current supply of an asset to its annual production rate.A higher ratio suggests greater scarcity, leading to a higher price. However, Thielen argues that the model doesn’t account for human behavior and changing market dynamics.“The model assumes that higher prices will not incentivize increased production,” Thielen explains. “While this might hold true for gold, Bitcoin mining can be readily adjusted based on profitability.”Diminishing Returns And Cycle AnalysisThe report also highlights a potential weakening in Bitcoin’s historical cycle pattern. 10x Research observed a diminishing upside projection in each cycle, suggesting a potential limit to future growth.“The low to high from the 2011 to 2013 cycle was a staggering 560x,” Thielen notes. “Following a pattern of dividing each cycle by roughly 5, our analysis projected a high of $70,000 for the current cycle, which aligns well with what we’ve seen so far.”Also Read: Digital Currency Group Sees Revenue Rise Despite Grayscale StrugglesFocus on Trading The CyclesWhile questioning the $1.3 million target, 10x Research emphasizes the importance of understanding cyclical trends.“Bitcoin has historically experienced significant price drops between bull cycles,” Thielen states. “Investors should consider trading these cycles rather than simply holding (HODLing) their assets.”The Road Ahead: Consolidation And Potential RallyThe report predicts a potential consolidation period for Bitcoin in the near future, with prices settling around $52,000-$55,000. However, they see an opportunity for a rally later in the year.“Market excitement surrounding a potential Trump win in the upcoming US election could drive Bitcoin back to $70,000 or higher,” Thielen suggests. “A volatile market environment presents the best opportunity for investors to leverage our insights.”Looking Ahead: Benzinga’s Future Of Digital AssetsThe future of Bitcoin price predictions and market behavior will undoubtedly be a hot topic at upcoming industry events. Benzinga’s Future of Digital Assets conference, happening on Nov. 19, is one such platform where leading analysts and investors will gather to discuss the latest trends and strategies.Read Next: SEC Accusations Misworded?

Crypto And Politics: Cardano Founder Says Don’t Vote This Presidential Candidate | Bitcoinist.com


								With the US presidential elections fast-approaching, industries such as cryptocurrency have been drawn into the discussion as to what it could mean for their future. Cardano founder Charles Hoskinson has also shared his insights on the elections, particularly on the candidates, about what a victory for each candidate would mean for the crypto industry and its future.
Cardano Founder Does Not Want President Joe Biden
President Joe Biden is currently running for a second term after emerging victorious in the 2020 presidential elections. However, this time around, the 46th president of the United States is not seeing as much support as he did back then.

Cardano founder Charles Hoskinson points out the fact that the Biden administration has been particularly bad for the crypto industry. In a broadcast on X (formerly Twitter) on Thursday, he revealed his disapproval of how the Biden administration has approached the crypto industry, accusing the president of trying to hurt the industry with every chance he got.
Given this, the Cardano founder is vehemently against President Joe Biden taking office for a second term. According to Hoskinson, “A vote for Biden is a vote against the American cryptocurrency industry.”Hoskinson’s comments come in light of the White House releasing a statement that said the incumbent president plans to disapprove legislation that would allow the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to prevent banks from holding crypto. But it seems this has come a little too late for crypto stakeholders.
While the Cardano founder does not outright endorse Former President Donald Trump, Biden’s fiercest rival, he does admit that things were much better for crypto under his administration.” The [Trump] administration had its issues but mostly ignored our industry,” Hoskinson said. “The Biden administration has engaged in a coordinated effort to kill crypto.”
Donald Trump Goes To Bat For Crypto
While President Joe Biden continues to skirt around the issue of laying out support for crypto, opposition Donald Trump has been guns out with his support for crypto. Earlier this week, Trump declared his support of the crypto industry. The former president has called on all crypto supporters to vote for him, saying, “If you’re in favor of crypto, you better vote for Trump.”

Interestingly, Trump’s support for the crypto industry did not just begin. The presidential candidate has been involved in the industry for a number of years now, even launching multiple non-fungible tokens (NFTs) collections called the “Trump Digital Trading Cards.”
These NFT collections were well-received by crypto investors, generating over 15,000 ETH in volume from OpenSea alone, with almost 14,000 unique holders. Donald Trump also holds a significant amount of Ethereum (ETH) as well as other altcoins sent to his wallet by the community.

Exclusive: PlayShutdown CEO Talks on Q4 Launch, $FUSE Token Airdrop, and Game Design | Cryptopolitan

PlayShutdown is one of those games set in the “dystopian universe” theme but brings a whole new visual style to the popular gaming trope. At its core, Shutdown is an action-packed ARPG shooter built on the impressive Unreal Engine 5. But with its unique blend of features comes a wave of questions.In this interview, we got Houston Song, CEO of PlayShutdown, to answer some questions about the game and lift the lid on the game’s design choices, full release date, and potential airdrop of its upcoming $FUSE token. Hello Houston. I read you are an early investor in DOGE and ETH and have been in gaming for 8 years. How did it all start, and is Shutdown your first gaming project? Yes, Doge was actually my first crypto that I bought back in 2014. Back then, it was the meme of the year and it had just launched. I actually found it on Reddit where people were just trading it through threads.I switched over to Ethereum in 2015 because it was a more serious project, and I believed that the vision of having a programmable blockchain made sense.Playshutdown CEO, Houston SongI met my game developer and co-founder, Adam, in 2018, when we discussed gaming and crypto. We decided to combine the two, and that’s how the studio started.Our first title was actually a pretty ambitious FPS called Dissolution, but unfortunately, the technology at the time (Ethereum) didn’t have the scalability we needed.The project Shutdown started in 2022, once we already had a fair bit of experience working together on games.Can you walk us through the core gameplay loop in Shutdown? How will players spend most of their time, and what keeps them engaged?This game is an action role-playing game (ARPG) similar to Diablo or Path of Exile. Players aim to craft unique “builds” by combining items to achieve varying levels of power. The game concentrates on player versus environment (PvE) gameplay and a complex item economy. With random number generator (RnG) elements, the game introduces Web2 players to Web3 concepts in an engaging and accessible way.All of the items (weapons, armor, accessories, & equipment) in ShutDown start off as database items like in any other game. The player can upgrade them by using other items or components. Once these items get to the endgame, players are given the option to mint them as NFTs. In the process of minting them on-chain, they’re granted unique traits and abilities that can be combined with other items in the build to create some pretty badass combinations, which players will need to beat later stages in the game that are quite difficult.It’s this process of figuring out the best build for your character and growing stronger that makes ShutDown exciting and fun to play. Some might argue that the “dystopian universe” and “AI” themes are overused tropes in gaming. How would you counter that?It’s all about execution.Shutdown brings a unique visual style to the trope that sets us apart. I think the most important thing is gameplay – we’re all gun enthusiasts in our office, so we’ve spent quite a bit of time making sure the guns feel unique and satisfying to use.We’ve got a very talented team of folks that work on Shutdown – our Art director, Wesley, is a living encyclopedia when it comes to sci-fi games and movies, with work experience in Netease and Ubisoft.We’re also working with a super talented concept artist, Frank Yang, who helped lead the design direction on some big sci-fi IPs like the TV show “The Expanse.”Shutdown is built with Unreal Engine. Can you elaborate on the game design and qualities that players may find interesting? We wanted to make the combat feel super smooth, with impactful gunplay that makes you feel satisfied every time you pull the trigger. We wanted to give the Mongrel (the main character) the feeling of being a badass super soldier who can fight through hordes of enemies.Shutdown is big on customization, so you can tailor your abilities and build to fit any playstyle you want. This flexibility keeps the gameplay fresh each time you approach the game. One of the things that keeps the game interesting is the RNG elements, which means every game session will feel different. This can range from how enemies spawn to the type of loot that you might find.We take advantage of Unreal Engine’s support for Physically-Based Rendering, which makes the characters and world come to life with super realistic lighting and textures. Visually, we wanted to present a gruesome dystopian sci-fi world that is a departure from the vibrant IPs that are more common in Play-to-Earn games.Don’t you think the cross-play between platforms will give PC players with better hardware an inherent advantage over mobile users?Yes, PC players will have a slight advantage over mobile users. We’ve done our best to mitigate this by simplifying the controls. It is not a PvP-focused game, so I think it will still enhance the player experience, as PC players will be able to play with their friends who don’t have gaming rigs.It is a strategic decision we made at the start of development to reduce the barrier to entry for players who can play Shutdown. The AI threat in the game is very difficult, so you’ll want to have a couple of battle buddies to help you complete missions.Shutdown launched open-beta in Q1 2024 with 3,700+ weekly active users. Which regions or player types stand out the most from your user base?We were surprised by how many players there were in LATAM. That region is definitely going to be the next big wave of adoption in both web2 and web3 games.There was also a surprising number of competitive players, indicating that we have plenty of room to increase the game’s difficulty.When do you anticipate a full release of the game?We’re aiming for a public release in Q4 2024. The game is seasonal, so we plan to have content refreshes every 3-4 months. The mobile version of the game will launch in Q2 of 2025.The native token $FUSE is set to launch on major exchanges in early Q3 2024. Can you tell us more about the $FUSE launch? Will there be an airdrop for early users? I can’t reveal too many details about the $FUSE launch other than that it will be huge!There will be an airdrop for players who hold our NFTs and have posted scores. That’s all I can say!How does the web3 aspect integrate with gameplay?In the game “Shutdown,” Web3 integration plays a crucial role by enhancing gameplay and providing unique value through two main elements: Tokens and NFTs.Tokens as Premium Currency:Tokens in “Shutdown” serve as a premium currency. This means they’re used for special transactions within the game, such as purchasing exclusive items, accessing unique game areas, or upgrading characters and equipment. This premium status of tokens often encourages players to engage more deeply with the game to earn or acquire these tokens, driving both the gameplay and economic aspects of the game.NFTs as End-Game Items:NFTs (Non-Fungible Tokens) are used to represent the most powerful items in the game, essentially the end-game loot. These items are not just valuable because of their rarity or power within the game but also because they can be traded or sold outside the game, potentially for real-world value. This aspect adds a layer of investment and strategy to playing the game as players aim to acquire, use, and potentially profit from these high-value items.Minting NFTs:The process of minting NFTs in “Shutdown” is gamified, making it an engaging part of the gameplay rather than just a transaction. When players mint an NFT, the stats and abilities of the item are generated randomly. This introduces elements of surprise and chance, which can be thrilling for players. Each NFT item is unique, enhancing its value and the personal connection players might feel toward their in-game assets.By integrating these Web3 elements, “Shutdown” offers a gaming experience where the digital assets players earn or create have real value, both within and potentially outside the game world, adding layers of strategy, investment, and engagement to the traditional gaming experience.The P2E market has seen boom-and-bust cycles. How is Shutdown any different?Just like any Play-to-Earn game out there, “Shutdown” rides the same rollercoaster of market ups and downs and changes in player interest, especially in the short term.At its heart, “Shutdown” is built for folks who are into traditional gaming. We’ve borrowed the best parts of classic web2 games—the kind of stuff that keeps players hooked. By focusing on these proven gameplay elements, we’re really aiming for the long haul, not just a flash in the pan. This strategy helps us smooth out the wild swings that can happen in the P2E market by keeping our eyes on solid game mechanics rather than just the hype around the game’s tokens.When it comes to developing “Shutdown,” we’re sticking to the playbook of tried-and-true gaming business tactics. That means strong development processes, smart ways to bring in new players, and ways to make money that keep the lights on for the long term. All this stuff is key to keeping the game stable and growing even when the P2E scene gets shaky.The real kicker is how we’ve integrated the game’s token right into the gameplay. It’s not just there for show; players actually need it to get ahead in the game, making it a crucial part of the whole experience. This setup means the token isn’t just something to trade—it’s something that adds real value to the game, which keeps players coming back. By making sure the token is something players really want and can use, we’re building a game that stands on its own, powered by real demand from real gameplay.What is the long-term vision for Playshutdown?The long-term vision for Playshutdown is to develop it into a comprehensive IP or universe, where we plan to release a variety of games across different genres and platforms. This strategic expansion includes the development of an FPS game that is currently underway.A key component of our vision involves the integration of tokens and NFTs, which will serve a pivotal role across all titles within the Shutdown ecosystem. These digital assets are designed to have cross-game utility, allowing players to leverage their investments and interactions in one game across others within the Shutdown portfolio. This approach not only enhances the user experience by adding value and continuity to their interactions but also fosters a more interconnected and dynamic gaming environment under the Shutdown brand.Last question. What’s your outlook for Web3 gaming in the next five years?In the next five years, Web3 gaming is probably going to shake things up quite a bit. We’re looking at two main types of games emerging: ones that double down on the whole Play-to-Earn (P2E) thing and others that aim to make it easier for regular gamers to get into Web3 stuff.“Shutdown” is ahead of the game here, already figuring out how to blend traditional gaming with Web3 to attract players from the Web2 world. This approach is not just about using cool new tech but making it super smooth for players to jump in.Also, there’s going to be a big push to get new players from places like Latin America and Africa. These regions are like hidden gems, loaded with potential gamers who haven’t been tapped into much yet.As these new markets open up, making games that everyone can actually play—no matter where they are or what tech they have—will be key. This could really change the kind of games that are made in the future.Lastly, the money side of P2E games is going to get more attention from regulators, especially in places like South Korea, where they are on top of their game with tech laws. As the blend of gaming and finance gets tighter, we’ll probably see more rules coming in to keep things fair and safe.

Crypto Expert Reveals How To Find 'High-Risk High Reward' Meme Coins - Benzinga

Pseudonymous crypto researcher CryptoKoryo, in his latest YouTube video, offered valuable insights and strategies for traders looking to trade meme coins.What Happened: The researcher highlights the potential of meme coins with stories of individuals turning $1,000 into a million dollars within a month. However, the reality is often different with many traders buying a meme coin thinking they are early but they land up at zero.He cited the real example of someone who bought $600 worth of Pepe on the first day it was tradable, sold the same day for a $60 profit, but could have made $9 million if they had held on.He recommends having a combination of two approaches for playing the game well:
Meme coins tend to perform best during specific periods, such as Q1 2024 and Q2 2023.



Studying parabolic moves and adoption waves, as meme coins often experience explosive growth followed by steep corrections.
He breaks down the adoption waves of meme coins into three distinct phases:
Wave one: Riskiest but offers the highest potential rewards, early buyers positioned to make substantial gains. (Examples: Popcat, Grok, BOME)



Wave two: More challenging, as traders must determine whether a meme coin will continue its upward trajectory or fade away. (Examples: Dogwifhat (CRYPTO: WIF), Pepe PEPE/USD, Bonk BONK/USD)



Wave three: Least risky, as the meme coin is already established. Potential returns are lower compared to earlier waves. (Examples: Dogecoin (CRYPTO: DOGE), Shiba Inu SHIB/USD)
He cautions investors/traders of influencers and "shillers" who may have their agendas, but not to ignore them entirely, as they can provide valuable information.Also Read: DOGE Is The ‘BTC Of Memes’ And These Two Meme Coins Are The ETH And A ‘Must Have,’ Trader ToutsWhy It Matters: CryptoKoryo notes that trading meme coins requires discipline, patience and a long-term perspective. "Don’t try to become rich overnight," he advises. "Try to focus on longevity as a trader and just becoming a bit better every time with every coin trade."In his meme coin narrative X post, the expert highlighted that the number of meme coins is too high and rising at a rapid pace, increasing supply, unlike in 2021 when demand exceeded supply.He notes two strategies: a fully on-chain approach wherein risk/reward is great but the win rate is low. Alternatively, waiting for a narrative to take over Crypto Twitter, thus increasing the win rate but giving up some of the risk/reward ratio.Kroyo opts for a combination of both approaches, as few of the thousand meme coins will be profitable. Compared to meme coins in 2021, Koryo thinks “It’s more like high-risk low-reward for most."What’s Next: The influence of Bitcoin as an institutional asset class is expected to be thoroughly explored at Benzinga’s upcoming Future of Digital Assets event on Nov. 19.Read Next: VanEck Meme Coin Index With DOGE And SHIB Would ‘Outperform 99% Of People If You Left It Alone,’ Says TraderThis content was partially produced with the help of AI tools and was reviewed and published by Benzinga editors.Image: Shutterstock

'BBL Drizzy' Coin Surges Amid Drake and Kendrick Lamar Feud as Another Coin Secures $13 Million

                        Hip Hop is back with a bang in 2024, as industry legends Kendrick Lamar and Drake duke it out for the crown in an increasingly hostile rap battle – and Solana meme coin markets haven’t missed a beat, with new OVHoe (BBL DRIZZY) token skyrocketing.This article will provide an analysis of BBL DRIZZY’s current price trends in the Solana meme coin market and look to see whether an innovative new meme coin, DOGEVERSE, represents a more promising investment opportunity at this time.BBL DRIZZY undertook an exceptional rally as retail investors flocked to the meme value surrounding Drake’s tumultuous exchange with Kendrick – which has so far seen Drizzy branded as a sexual predator, ‘deadbeat’ Dad, master manipulator, and target for physical shootings.BBL DRIZZY Price Analysis: As OVHOE Consolidates For Second Rally Leg – Is This Other Token Next to Pump?
As price action attempts to consolidate down at lower support, BBL DRIZZY is currently trading at a market price of $0.000709 (representing a 24-hour change of -31%).This comes after OVHOE undertook an exceptional Solana meme coin launch at 20:00 UTC on May 9, in a listing that gained instant traction with the price exploding a whopping +13,500% in the first 4 hours.Hitting an all-time high at $0.0034, the following hours have seen a major retracement move grip the chart – with price action so far down -78%.However, with consolidation now risking a second re-test of lower support at $0.0074, OVHOE is in a make-or-break position which could see the token sink-or-swim.Yet, there remain tangible reasons to be optimistic about BBL DRIZZY price action, with OVHOE’s market cap still alluring retail investors enamored by the Kendrick Lamar – Drake beef at $70k.Indeed, despite not being officially affiliated with the duo, there is potential that the release of further diss tracks could lead to bullish action returning to the coin.Although, as ever with meme coins, that is pure speculation.Meanwhile, an emerging crypto presale has unlocked viral success, having raised over $13M in a matter of weeks and there is still time to get involvedDiscover DOGEVERSE: Could Presales Offer Better Meme Coin Play?
While SOL presents a market-leading opportunity, the most significant gains are often found in presale investments, which allow investors to get in early and potentially secure the majority of a project’s growth. Just imagine investing in BBL DRIZZY before it hit the market and skyrocketed 30,000%.One such opportunity in the SOL ecosystem is the DOGEVERSE presale – which has unlocked viral success over the last month to hit $13M raised in the ongoing presale.Aiming to be the first multi-chain incarnation of DOGE, DOGEVERSE is positioned to grow rapidly as market participants race to grab a piece of the pie.DOGEVERSE is still raising funds at the presale stage and will start preparing for exchange listings very soon.Buy DOGEVERSE Here

Consolation Payment to the Victim Who Sent 71 Million Dollars of Bitcoin (BTC) to the Hacker with His Own Hands! - Bitcoin Sistemi

The most talked about hacking incident of recent times took place last week. In this incident, an investor was attacked by a hacker while trying to send Bitcoin to his own address, and he sent WBTC worth $71 million to the hacker with his own hands.
As a week passed after the hack, the hacker relented and made a consolation payment to the person whose WBTC he stole.


According to Lookonchain's post, the hacker made a refund and has returned a total of 4,676 Ethereum-ETH (worth $14.2 million) piece by piece so far.
https://twitter.com/lookonchain/status/1788857898086637909?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1788857898086637909%7Ctwgr%5Ed0d14b65b3594b595aa2eaf 5f7f7c0dcd7dd5f18%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fu.today%2Fhacker-makes- rare-move-to-refund-stolen-71-million-in-crypto





What Happened?
One person lost 1,155 Wrapped Bitcoin (WBTC), worth over $71 million, due to a phishing attack known as 'address poisoning'.
This person initially sent 0.05 ETH to an account he created. This person, who had no problems with this transaction, later sent WBTC worth 71 million. However, he sent it to the address created by the hacker, not to his own wallet.


Because when this person sent ETH for trial purposes, his address became visible in the transaction history. The hacker who followed this person created a similar address by making the letters at the beginning and end the same.
This person, who fell into the hacker's trap, sent all his WBTC to an address very similar to his own.





If this person had fully checked the entire address, perhaps they would not have lost their Bitcoins.

Donald Trump's Crypto Endorsement Lauded By Industry Figures Who Vow To 'Support President Trump' - Benzinga

Former U.S. President Donald Trump‘s recent endorsement of cryptocurrency has received a wave of support from prominent figures within the crypto community, signaling a significant shift in the political discourse surrounding digital assets.What Happened: During an event at Mar-a-Lago, Trump addressed enthusiasts and buyers of his NFT collection, underscoring his support for the industry and contrasting his stance with President Joe Biden's perceived cautious approach.Ryan Selkis, Founder and CEO of Messari, expressed his unexpected support online after sharing the stage with Trump, tweeting, "President Trump spoke very highly about crypto and then…invited me and @MihailoBjelic on stage to say a few words.
