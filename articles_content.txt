Dycom Industries, Inc. (NYSE: DY) announced its fiscal 2025 first-quarter results, showcasing a notable performance improvement. The company reported contract revenues of $1.142 billion, reflecting a 9.3% increase compared to $1.045 billion in the same quarter last year. This growth includes a 2.5% organic increase, excluding $71.2 million from acquired businesses. Non-GAAP Adjusted EBITDA rose to $130.9 million, or 11.5% of contract revenues, up from $113.5 million, or 10.9%, in the previous year. Net income also significantly rose to $62.6 million, or $2.12 per diluted share, compared to $51.5 million, or $1.73 per diluted share, in the prior year.



During the quarter, Dycom repurchased 210,000 common shares for $29.8 million, reflecting confidence in its financial health and future prospects. The company’s strategic acquisitions and organic growth have contributed to this robust performance, indicating a well-executed business plan. The increase in net income was partly due to income tax benefits from the vesting and exercise of share-based awards, amounting to $5.9 million, or $0.20 per diluted share, compared to $2.7 million, or $0.09 per diluted share, in the same quarter last year.



Dycom Industries Beats EPS and Revenue Expectations in Q1



Comparing the current quarter’s performance against expectations, Dycom significantly outperformed the anticipated earnings per share (EPS) of $1.51 by delivering $2.12 per diluted share. This represents a substantial positive variance, showcasing the company’s ability to exceed market forecasts. Additionally, the actual revenue of $1.142 billion surpassed the expected $1.09 billion, highlighting a strong demand for Dycom’s services and effective execution of its projects.



The company’s performance metrics, such as Non-GAAP Adjusted EBITDA and net income, indicate a successful quarter beyond just meeting expectations. The Non-GAAP Adjusted EBITDA margin improved to 11.5% from 10.9% in the previous year, suggesting better operational efficiency and cost management. The increase in net income, bolstered by higher revenues and tax benefits, further underscores Dycom’s robust financial health and strategic prowess.





Dycom Expects Contract Revenues to Grow by High Single Digits for the Next Quarter



Dycom provided optimistic guidance for the next quarter ending July 27, 2024. The company expects organic contract revenues to grow by high single-digits compared to the same quarter last year, alongside approximately $70 million from acquired contract revenues. This forward-looking statement suggests continued growth and integration of recent acquisitions, which are expected to contribute positively to the overall revenue.



Additionally, Dycom anticipates an increase in Non-GAAP Adjusted EBITDA as a percentage of contract revenues by 25 to 75 basis points compared to the quarter ended July 29, 2023. This guidance indicates a focus on maintaining and potentially improving operational efficiencies while scaling up revenues. Investors and stakeholders can access detailed guidance and additional information on the company’s website, reflecting Dycom’s commitment to transparency and informed investor relations.

Shiba Inu (SHIB) whales have continued their heavy accumulation of digital currency. According to data from the crypto analytics platform IntoTheBlock, large whale transactions come in at 73.72% within a 24-hour period. Per the data shared, a total of 327 large transactions were recorded in 24 hours, setting SHIB on an ambitious growth course.SHIB Large Transaction Chart. Source: IntoTheBlockIn actual volume, a total of 5.58 trillion SHIB was acquired by Shiba Inu whales in 24 hours. This SHIB volume is worth a total of $145.48 million, placing Shiba Inu among the most traded tokens by whales thus far this week. With whale transactions tagged as those with a monetary value of at least $100,000, the attractiveness of Shiba Inu has continued to grow. With more than 5.5 trillion tokens scooped up, the supply crunch introduced into the ecosystem might help sustain the bull rally it has printed in the past few days.However, the entire Shib Inu protocol, as reported earlier by U.Today, paints a problematic picture. After soaring as high as 10% in a single day, jumping above the 50-day EMA, the failure of SHIB’s price to continue the rally, according to numerous data, shows concerns.At the time of writing, Shiba Inu is priced at $0.00002612, up by 2.72% in the past 24 hours. Shiba Inu has been making a frantic effort to soar above the current price range and possibly break toward the $0.00007 high. These efforts have been backed by the intense deflationary push through its burn rate and aggressive Shibarium transaction growth.With these apparent efforts, Shiba Inu is arguably moving in tandem with the broader market. It is following the slower pace of the combined market to chart its growth course. However, there are expectations that the token will print a breakout in the long term.

Bitcoin ETFs See Significant Increases as Markets Lock on Ethereum ETF Approval! Which Company Is Leading? Here are the Details - Bitcoin Sistemi


Spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) in the United States are seeing significant investment inflows, recording their seventh consecutive day of net inflows on Tuesday. This increase in interest comes amid growing excitement over the potential approval of spot Ethereum ETFs.
Spot Bitcoin ETFs Experience Strong Inflows Amid Ethereum ETF Speculation
A total of $305.72 million was transferred to spot Bitcoin ETFs, according to data from multiple sources.



BlackRock's iShares Bitcoin Trust led the way, attracting $290 million of total inflows. Fidelity's Wise Origin Bitcoin Fund also had a positive impact, bringing in $26 million.

In contrast, Grayscale's transformed Bitcoin Trust, which experienced cumulative net outflows of $18 billion, recorded no net inflows on Tuesday.
Bitwise Bitcoin ETF and VanEck Bitcoin Trust were the only funds to see outflows, with net losses of $4 million and $6 million, respectively. Other spot Bitcoin ETFs did not report any inflows or outflows.






Since their introduction to US exchanges, spot Bitcoin ETFs have been extremely popular, generating total net inflows of $13.17 billion.
The recent success of spot Bitcoin ETFs has shifted the focus in the cryptocurrency and financial markets to the potential approval of spot Ethereum ETFs.


The US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) reportedly asked exchanges to amend their 19b-4 filings earlier this week, hinting at a possible move towards approval of these products.

How a Bitcoin Pizza Trade Pushed Decentralized Money into the Spotlight 14 Years Ago - Tokenist


					
Neither the author, Tim Fries, nor this website, The Tokenist, provide financial advice. Please consult our website policy prior to making financial decisions.



Fourteen years ago, on May 22, 2010, two pizzas were bought for 10,000 BTC, a transaction worth over $700 million today. This historic event marked the first documented real-world use of Bitcoin. It demonstrated the potential of decentralized digital currency, setting the stage for a revolution in finance.



Bitcoin is the World’s First Widely-Adopted Decentralized Digital Currency 



Bitcoin, the world’s first decentralized digital currency, was introduced by the pseudonymous Satoshi Nakamoto in 2009. The concept behind Bitcoin was to create a peer-to-peer electronic cash system that would operate without a central authority, such as banks or governments. Decentralized currencies like Bitcoin offer several advantages over traditional currencies, including lower transaction fees, increased security, and the ability to conduct transactions without intermediaries.





A Programmer from Florida Paid 10,000 BTC for Two Large Pizzas



On May 22, 2010, Laszlo Hanyecz, a programmer from Florida, made a post on the BitcoinTalk forum offering to pay 10,000 BTC for two large pizzas. On the forum, Jeremy Sturdivant (known as “jercos”) accepted the offer and arranged to deliver two Papa John’s pizzas to Hanyecz’s home. This transaction, worth roughly $41 then, marked the first documented real-world use of Bitcoin as a medium of exchange, demonstrating the cryptocurrency’s potential for everyday transactions.



The pizza transaction had an immediate impact on the Bitcoin community. It validated Bitcoin’s use case and encouraged other users to explore real-world applications for the cryptocurrency. The transaction also attracted early media attention, sparking growing curiosity about the potential of digital currencies.



Over the years, the significance of the pizza transaction has only grown. The value of Bitcoin has skyrocketed, with 10,000 BTC worth over $700 million as of 2024. The Bitcoin Pizza Index, which tracks the value of the pizza transaction over time, has become a popular way to illustrate the cryptocurrency’s growth. The transaction also paved the way for technological advancements in blockchain technology and inspired the creation of numerous other cryptocurrencies.

                        Stephen Findeisen, popularly known as “Coffeezilla” on YouTube, has accused artificial intelligence company Rabbit AI of orchestrating a nonfungible token (NFT) scam and attempting to cover it up.Findeisen, a prominent investigator on the video-sharing platform, recently released a video on the Coffeezilla channel, shedding light on Rabbit AI’s alleged involvement in the NFT space.According to Findeisen’s findings, Rabbit AI was previously known as Cyber Manufacture Co. and managed to raise $6 million for an NFT project named Gama.However, the company’s founder and CEO, Jesse Lyu, later distanced Rabbit AI from the world of cryptocurrencies, stating that they would “never touch crypto” in Discord statements.Fun Little Project
Lyu claimed that Gama was merely a “fun little project” he participated in during the COVID-19 pandemic and that he left the project once the associated game was open-sourced.Contradicting Lyu’s claims, Findeisen presented recordings in which Lyu discussed ambitious plans for the Gama project.In those recordings, Lyu expressed intentions of investing millions into Gama to create a groundbreaking NFT experience.He also mentioned future plans for a concept called Gamaverse and the potential for a clean energy initiative in relation to Gama Coin.Findeisen raised concerns about the $6 million funding raised for the Gama project, questioning where the money had been allocated.Despite Rabbit AI’s assertion that the funds were solely used for the NFT project, Coffeezilla argued that Rabbit AI’s foundation was built on the remnants of the Gama project, making it a matter of concern.Additionally, Findeisen criticized the overhyped nature of Rabbit AI’s viral R1 product, drawing parallels between the exaggerated promises made by both Gama and R1.Coffeezilla’s allegations are not isolated, as others have also expressed skepticism about Rabbit AI’s offerings.Josh Olin, the founder and CEO of WeGPT, previously labeled Rabbit’s project as a “scam,” characterizing it as a quick cash grab designed to lure in investors.Logan Paul-Coffeezilla Cryptozoo Controversy
Online detective Coffeezilla has made himself a reputation by uncovering crypto scams.Specifically, he made headlines last year for going after popular YouTuber and influencer Logan Paul to expose his “scam” project CryptoZoo.CryptoZoo was launched in September 2021 with much fanfare, with Paul himself being one of the founders of the project.The game utilized its own cryptocurrency called ZooCoin, with buyers able to purchase “eggs” that would hatch into randomized animals with different rarities.These animals could then be bred to create cross-bred creatures that would act as NFTs. The NFTs could be held or burned to earn more ZooCoin, purportedly providing buyers with significant returns on their investments.However, in a three-part series of videos uploaded at the end of 2021, Coffeezilla alleged that CryptoZoo had been largely abandoned shortly after its launch.He claimed that Paul distanced himself from the project, despite the extensive pre-release attention he had given it.In response to Coffeezilla’s allegations, Paul released a video blaming the co-founders and advisors of CryptoZoo for any wrongdoing and sensationalizing the story. He even threatened to sue Coffeezilla.

Smart traders take millions in profit from this crypto as retail FOMO in


    High recent on-chain activity has registered at least three smart traders taking profits from the popular meme coin PEPE. These cryptocurrency whales have made millions of dollars in trades as retail jumps in with ‘Fear of Missing Out’ (FOMO).



Finbold gathered this data from four different Lookonchain reports posted on X on May 22, suggesting a reversal could happen.



PEPE smart traders’ whale activity



First, an early buyer deposited all their 182.9 billion PEPE holdings, worth $2.53 million, into a Binance account. This was the remaining amount of a $462 initial purchase of 324.9 billion PEPE last year. In total, this smart trade rendered over $3.4 million in profits.

Second, the institutional investment firm BlockTower Capital sent $2.8 million worth of 202 billion PEPE to Cumberland, a known market maker that provides liquidity for institutional and retail trading. The transaction happened as the meme coin price broke through $0.000014 per token.



This was a six-day swing trade that earned BlockTower Capital $578,000 in profits on a $2.22 million investment.

Last, a smart trader deposited $2.83 million of PEPE to the Bybit crypto exchange as its third profitable trade. This trader is considered smart due to its 100% win rate trading PEPE, for an estimated total profit of $2.48 million.

FOMO: Retail and whales are still buying



Meanwhile, a few hours after the last activity, another whale withdrew $7.95 million in 592 billion PEPE from Binance. Lookonchain estimates this resulted from a two-day purchase during a notable price pump for the meme coin.







On May 19, Finbold reported another trader who lost $300,000 in two days of bad trading decisions with PEPE.



Moreover, Finbold gathered data from Santiment showing an increased social volume, indicating increased retail interest. Usually, these social indicators peak a few days before a trend reversal, as smart trader whales take profit over the FOMOing retail.

Meme coins and the Greater Fool Theory



Meme coins, such as PEPE, often lack fundamental value and are driven by hype and social media buzz. Traders who buy these coins are essentially gambling in the hope that someone else will buy them at a higher price.



This mentality aligns with the “Greater Fool Theory,” which suggests that profits can be made by buying overvalued assets and selling them to a “greater fool.”



However, this theory also highlights the inherent risk of such investments, as the market eventually runs out of willing buyers. When the hype dies down, and demand dwindles, traders can be left holding worthless cryptocurrencies, leading to substantial financial losses.

Crypto security: $22 million returned to Gala Games

A couple of days ago, a security incident occurred involving the crypto of Gala Games.
 A hacker managed to access the platform with the administrator address of Gala Games, and created 5 billion new GALA tokens.  

Subsequently, he transferred approximately 4,600 ETH to 0x, and sold 600 million of the tokens he minted on Uniswap, cashing in 21 million dollars. 
Subsequently, 4.4 billion GALA tokens were burned.


The return of the bull and bear funds 
Yesterday, more than 5,900 ETH (over 22 million dollars) were sent from the hacker’s wallet to Gala Games.

L’ipotesi è che abbia deciso di restituire parte del bottino. 
According to Gala Games, the decision would have been the result of their timely and effective response, and the involvement of law enforcement. 
“`html
As they stated yesterday in a post on their official blog, the unauthorized wallet was locked down in record time, and the funds were returned because the security measures proved to be effective.
“`
Something similar, however, had also happened in the past, so it is difficult to imagine that the security measures worked 100%. 
The reaction of Gala Games: our crypto security worked
On Monday afternoon, an unusual transfer of GALA tokens occurred on the Ethereum network worth 200 million dollars.
Gala Games promptly responded by activating the blocklist protocol of GalaChain, to quickly block any further unauthorized minting and movement of GALA tokens, thus mitigating the effects of the incident.
Thanks to the swift intervention, within 45 minutes of the unauthorized minting, approximately 90% of the GALA tokens minted by the hacker were blocked. 
This was made possible thanks to a new feature implemented with the update to version v2.
Subsequently, Gala Games contacted the U.S. federal law enforcement authorities, hoping that they will initiate a thorough investigation and appropriate legal action against the culprits.
They also claim that the minting capabilities of GALA on GalaChain would still be secure, because the internal controls and multisig security protocols are designed to protect against such incidents and are continuously improved to keep up with new potential threats.
They have also decided to reimburse anyone who has been subject to unreasonably high transaction fees associated with this incident.
Gala Games:  La questione della sicurezza crypto 
Security on blockchain smart contracts is fundamental because they are public and accessible to everyone. 
In this case, the violation was carried out against the Gala platform, and in particular against the administrator’s account. 
Despite this, they claim that their security measures are solid and effective, and that they are committed to maintaining the highest standards of security and transparency. 
They justify the problem by saying that being pioneers in unknown territories can sometimes be a risky activity, but they assure that GalaChain is well-equipped to handle any unforeseen challenge that Web3 may throw. 
The token GALA
Today the price of the GALA token on the crypto markets has increased by 13%.
In reality, it has simply returned to the level prior to the news of the incident, given that on Monday it was above 46 thousandths of a dollar and today it has returned to just below 47 thousandths. 
Yesterday it had dropped to below 42 thousandths, with a daily loss of more than 12%. 
It is worth noting that at the beginning of 2024 it was at 30 thousandths, and during the month of February it rose significantly, reaching a peak of over 87 thousandths in early March. 
In April, however, it had already fallen below 35 thousandths, but only to bounce back above 50 thousandths at the end of the month. 
In May, it first fell below 39 thousandths and then recovered and rose above 46. 
The current price is in line with that of April 25, and it is 55% higher than at the beginning of the year. 
It should be remembered, however, that it is still down by as much as -94% compared to the highs of 2021, but that was a truly gigantic speculative bubble. 
At the end of 2020, the price was below 1 thousandth of a dollar, and by March 2021 it had already risen above 30 thousandths, which is a level in line with the current one. 
The bull si è gonfiata da settembre a novembre, quando nel giro di poco più di due mesi il prezzo schizzò ad oltre 824 millesimi. 
The burst of the bubble ended in January 2023 when the price had fallen below 17 thousandths. Even in November, it was just above 18 thousandths. 
Sure, here is the translation:
“`html
The company Gala Games 
“`
Gala Games è una piattaforma di gaming che vuole restituire ai gamer il controllo sui loro giochi. 
Their mission is to create blockchain games, but with the goal of radically changing the online gaming market. 
Their platform is also equipped with a voting mechanism, based on the Founder’s Node, which allows players to express their opinion on the games that Gala should develop and on which games should receive funding. 
Since its launch in 2019, Gala Games has reached 1.3 million active users and has sold over 26,000 NTF.

Bitcoin (BTC) Hovers Around $70K After ETF Records Month-High Inflows

Bitcoin hovered around the $70,000 mark during the European morning, a slight drop following Tuesday's rally to as high as $71,400. BTC is currently priced at $70,069, around 1.6% lower over 24 hours. The CoinDesk 20 Index (CD20), offering a measurement of the broader digital asset market, fell about 0.5%. BlackRock's spot bitcoin ETF (IBIT) recorded over $290 million in inflows on Tuesday, its highest one-day figure since April 5 and nearly three times the previous high this month: $93 million on May 16. As a whole, ETFs took on nearly $300 million in net inflows on Tuesday.

WisdomTree, Managing $111 Billion, Received Approval to List Bitcoin and Ethereum ETPs! - Bitcoin Sistemi


While the SEC's critical decision on spot Ethereum ETFs was awaited, positive news came from the UK.
WisdomTree has received approval to launch Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) investment products (ETP) on the London Stock Exchange, Coindesk reported.


World-renowned asset manager WisdomTree (WT) announced that it has received approval from the UK Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) to list Bitcoin and Ethereum ETPs on the London Stock Exchange (LSE).
In the statement made today, it was stated that WisdomTree's Physical Bitcoin (BTCW) and Physical Ethereum (ETHW) ETPs will begin trading on May 28 and will be open to professional investors only.





The company, which has more than $111 billion in assets under management and a spot BTC ETF (WisdomTree Bitcoin Fund -BTCW) approved in the US, has been offering crypto products on European exchanges since 2019.
The FCA banned crypto derivatives, including ETPs, in January 2020. But the FCA said it would not object to requests from financial institutions seeking to list ETPs for professional investors, softening its bans after such crypto-based products have been widely used in Europe for several years and the approval of spot ETFs in the US in January.


While the FCA has approved crypto ETPs for professional investors, the ban remains in place for retail investors.

Global Bitcoin ATM Numbers Decline for the First Time Since July 2023



                    

For the first time since July 2023, the number of active Bitcoin ATMs worldwide has decreased.



The United States and Canada dominate the Bitcoin ATM landscape, accounting for 91.4% of the global network. The U.S. hosts 31,089 (82.6%) machines, while Canada has 2,909 (7.7%).




In 2024, countries worldwide significantly contributed to the month-on-month increase in Bitcoin ATMs, nearly reaching the 38,000 mark lost in January 2023. 



However, the 10-month-long global growth streak ended when over 300 ATMs went offline in May 2024. 



As of May 21, the U.S. market saw a loss of 302 Bitcoin ATMs, and Canada lost 28 machines.




Despite these losses, new Bitcoin ATMs in Australia, Switzerland, and Europe helped reduce the net decline to 280 machines at the time of publication.



Law enforcement agencies in the U.S. actively pursue and shut down Bitcoin ATMs frequently used for extortion and scams.

However, the reasons behind the recent sharp decline in their numbers remain unclear.




Australia hosts the third-largest network of active Bitcoin ATMs after the U.S. and Canada, with 1,041 (2.8%) machines.



Bitcoin Depot, the largest ATM operator in the U.S., recorded steady earnings in 2024. 



The firm stated in its 10-K annual report filed on April 15 that there was no correlation between its revenues and the price of Bitcoin historically.



“Based on our own user surveys, a majority of our users use our products and services for non-speculative purposes, including money transfers, international remittances, and online purchases, among others,” Bitcoin Depot wrote.



According to the ATM operator, the lack of correlation between Bitcoin Depot’s revenues and the BTC price is partly due to the nature of the services provided.

Trump crypto donations: Better 'financial choices' or 'another cow to milk'? - AMBCrypto



Donald Trump has started accepting crypto donations for his 2024 presidential campaign.
Cryptocurrencies see an increased importance in the political discourse.

As anticipation builds for the United States presidential elections of 2024, former President Donald Trump has made a bold move.
On the 21st of May, Trump’s presidential campaign launched a fundraising page, enabling federally permissible donors to contribute using cryptocurrency through Coinbase Commerce.
This move stands in stark contrast to his opponent, President Joe Biden, who has been known to advocate for stricter crypto regulations.
Trump’s bold move
The announcement highlighted the reasons behind this decision and read,
“Today’s announcement reflects President Trump’s commitment to an agenda that values freedom over socialistic government control.”
Providing further insight into the Trump campaign’s intentions, the announcement emphasized,
“Biden surrogate Elizabeth Warren said in an attack on cryptocurrency that she was building an ‘anti-crypto army’ to restrict Americans’ right to make their own financial choices. MAGA supporters, now with a new cryptocurrency option, will build a crypto army moving the campaign to victory on November 5th!”
The remark on the ‘anti-crypto army’ was made in line with Warren’s re-election ad in March 2023.
Donald Trump donations are a paradigm shift 
These recent developments underscore a notable shift in the political landscape: in previous election cycles, cryptocurrency held little sway.
However, heightened regulatory scrutiny by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) targeting numerous crypto firms has ignited a debate among voters.
This newfound attention has pushed cryptocurrency into the forefront of political debate and campaign tactics, making it a big deal in the 2024 elections.
These developments beg the question: Will Trump’s recent actions reduce Biden’s chances of winning the election?
Trump’s various pro-crypto stance 
Trump has actively embraced cryptocurrency, including selling limited-run NFT trading cards for cryptocurrency in December 2023 and hosting a lavish dinner for his NFT buyers at the Mar-a-Lago club earlier in May.
In contrast, Biden’s campaign reflects his administration’s cautious stance towards cryptocurrency and its proponents.
Well, Trump is not the first to accept crypto donations. Back in 2015, Sen. Rand Paul accepted Bitcoin donations for his presidential campaign.
Additionally, Robert F. Kennedy Jr., also announced in May 2023 that his independent presidential bid would accept bitcoin donations.
However, despite Trump’s efforts to gain traction in the presidential race, David Hoffman, co-founder of Bankless, argues that his pro-crypto stance is nothing more than a joke.

Could Investors Cause Toncoin (TON) Price Correction?


Toncoin’s (TON) price failed to mark a new all-time high despite attempting to breach the key resistance of $7.0.
The likely reason behind this is the declining optimism of investors, which is evident in their behavior.
Toncoin Holders Hold Back

Toncoin’s price is experiencing the effect of declining bullishness among investors. The reason behind this is the lack of conviction among TON holders, which was visible in the downtick of the Mean Coin Age.
Mean Coin Age is a blockchain metric that calculates the average age of all coins by considering the time each coin has remained in its current address. It helps gauge the behavior of long-term holders and overall network stability.
The uptick in this indicator shows investors are holding onto their assets while the downtick hints at supply moving around the addresses. TON has noted a downtick since February, but the broader market cues kept increasing Toncoin’s price.

However, with the cues dissipating, the lack of conviction could show its effect on the price action.
But it’s not just the existing investors that are pessimistic; the potential TON holders are not too bullish either. This is evident in the network growth falling to a two-and-a-half-month low. 
Network growth is measured by the rate at which new addresses are formed on the network identified by their participation. It assesses whether the asset is gaining or losing traction in the market.

Since this indicator fell by 70% within a week, potential investors do not have much incentive at the moment. This may be reflected in Toncoin’s price action going forward.
TON Price Prediction: Key Support Level to Watch

Toncoin’s price attempted to breach the resistance of $7.0 but failed to trickle back in the last ten days. Consequently, TON fell below the crucial psychological support level of $6.5. A recent broader market rally pushed the altcoin above this support but could not sustain it, falling to trade at $6.2.
This bearishness will loom over Toncoin’s price unless the investors’ behavior changes. As a result, the cryptocurrency could fall to test the support at $6.0. Losing this support could lead to a dip to $5.4.

However, if Tocnoin’s price does not fall below the $6.0 support level, it could bounce back to $6.5. Flipping it into a support floor would enable recovery, potentially sending TON to $7, invalidating the bearish thesis.

A Deep Dive Into P2P

Editorial Note: The following content does not reflect the views or opinions of BeInCrypto. It is provided for informational purposes only and should not be interpreted as financial advice. Please conduct your own research before making any investment decisions. 
A look at the P2P exchange market and platforms, pros and cons, and more. 
Crypto has become a huge part of our lives over the years, but we still use fiat to pay for most of the services we use in our everyday lives – which means there’s been a demand for easy conversion since the dawn of crypto. 
One of the oldest, most trusted and popular ways to exchange coins to fiat out there is as decentralized as the whole crypto universe itself – it’s P2P, or Peer-to-Peer exchange, where users swap directly with each other.
A Quick P2P Market Overview
The properly decentralized P2P approach contrasts sharply with traditional centralized exchanges, where a single entity controls the order book and facilitates trades. P2P platforms empower users with full control over their transactions by allowing them to agree on terms and execute trades directly with each other. 
One of the defining features of P2P exchanges is their reliance on a network of users instead of a centralized system. This not only enhances privacy and security but also aligns with the foundational principles of blockchain — decentralization and user empowerment. Each participant in a P2P transaction uses software that directly connects them with other participants without needing a middleman, which can reduce fees and increase transaction  transparency.
Moreover, P2P platforms often incorporate sophisticated trust and reputation systems that allow users to rate each other based on their transaction history. This feature helps build a community of trusted users and mitigates the risk of fraud. Additionally, many P2P exchanges provide an escrow mechanism, where the cryptocurrency being traded is held by the platform until both parties confirm that the terms of the transaction have been met. This safeguard reassures users and enhances the reliability of trading on these platforms.
The importance of P2P exchanges has grown in regions where access to traditional banking is limited or where financial regulations restrict the use of centralized cryptocurrency exchanges. In these areas, P2P platforms offer a vital service, enabling inclusive participation in the global digital economy. Moreover, the adaptability of P2P exchanges allows them to serve a wide array of markets, catering to a diverse user base with varying needs and trading preferences.
Overall, the P2P market continues to expand due to all the perks it offers, and remains the most popular way to exchange crypto, despite other features being introduced by platforms. 
P2P Services: a Quick Overview
P2P platforms are designed to facilitate direct transactions between ordinary users in the cryptocurrency market. Here’s a closer look at some of the core services provided by P2P platforms:

Escrow Services: One of the most critical services offered by P2P platforms is the escrow system. When a trade is initiated, the cryptocurrency is held in escrow by the platform until all parties fulfill their parts of the deal. Only when both the buyer and the seller confirm that the transaction terms have been satisfied does the escrow release the funds. This service significantly reduces the risk of fraud and increases trust among platform users.
Reputation and Rating Systems: To enhance trustworthiness, P2P platforms often incorporate user ratings or reputation systems. Users can rate each other based on their experiences after a transaction is completed. These ratings are then compiled into a comprehensive reputation score for each user, visible to other participants. This transparency helps users make informed decisions about whom they choose to transact with.
Decentralized Dispute Resolution: Despite the best efforts of participants, disputes may still arise. Many P2P platforms have mechanisms for decentralized dispute resolution where neutral arbitrators or the community itself can get involved to adjudicate disagreements based on evidence provided by the transaction parties. This approach not only helps resolve conflicts fairly but also maintains the integrity of the trading environment.
Multi-Currency Support: Most P2P platforms support a wide range of cryptocurrencies and fiat currencies, allowing users from different geographic locations to trade in their preferred currencies. This inclusivity enhances the platform’s accessibility and utility, catering to a global audience with diverse needs.
Privacy Protection: In keeping with the ethos of cryptocurrency, P2P platforms typically offer more robust privacy protections compared to centralized exchanges. While users might still need to verify their identity to comply with regulatory requirements, the trading process itself can often be conducted anonymously, with no need for personal information to be exchanged between trading partners.
User-Friendly Interfaces: To attract and retain users, P2P platforms strive to offer clean, intuitive user interfaces that simplify the process of trading digital assets. Whether a novice or an experienced trader, the platform’s design ensures that users can navigate their trading environment effortlessly.


These services make P2P platforms an appealing option for users looking for a more personalized and secure trading experience. By combining the traditional benefits of cryptocurrency, like decentralization and privacy, with innovative trust-building tools, P2P exchanges are setting a new standard in the digital trading space.
A Look at the EMCD P2P Exchange
The EMCD platform stands out in the burgeoning P2P market, especially in Eastern Europe, where it has rapidly become a preferred choice for many cryptocurrency users. EMCD originally gained recognition as one of the top mining pools worldwide but has successfully expanded into the P2P exchange domain. Here’s an in-depth look at the unique features and benefits that EMCD offers:

Mining Pool Integration: EMCD’s roots in cryptocurrency mining provide a distinct advantage. Users who mine cryptocurrencies directly through EMCD can seamlessly exchange their mining rewards on the platform without needing to transfer their assets to another exchange. This integration simplifies the process, reduces transaction fees, and enhances security.
Wide Range of Supported Currencies: The EMCD P2P exchange supports a variety of fiat and cryptocurrencies, including but not limited to the Russian Ruble, Ukrainian Hryvnia, and the Kazakhstani Tenge, alongside major cryptocurrencies like USDT, Bitcoin, Ethereum and Litecoin. This diversity caters to a broad user base and facilitates easier and more flexible trading options across borders. Support for the Georgian lari will be added soon.
Robust Security Measures: Given its background in mining and its established infrastructure, EMCD places a strong emphasis on security. The platform implements advanced security protocols to protect users’ funds and personal information. Regular security audits and compliance with the latest cybersecurity practices ensure that the platform remains secure against potential threats.
User-Friendly Interface: EMCD’s platform is designed with user experience in mind. The interface is intuitive, making it accessible for both beginners and experienced traders. This ease of use is critical in attracting a broader audience and facilitating smooth transactions.
Local and International Bank Integration: EMCD’s integration with local and international banks is a standout feature that simplifies the process of fiat deposits and withdrawals. This service is particularly valuable in Eastern Europe, where users may face challenges with international banking transactions related to cryptocurrency trading.
24/7 Customer Support: EMCD offers round-the-clock customer support to address any issues that users may encounter. Quick and responsive support is essential in the P2P exchange space, where timely assistance can make a significant difference in user satisfaction and trust.
Community and Educational Resources: Understanding the complexities of cryptocurrency trading can be daunting for many. EMCD provides extensive educational resources to help users understand market trends, trading strategies, and the basics of cryptocurrency. Additionally, a strong community presence on platforms like Telegram allows users to engage with peers and experts, fostering a supportive trading environment.
No Regional Restrictions: Unlike some exchanges that limit access based on geographic location, EMCD offers its services without regional restrictions. This inclusivity ensures that users from various jurisdictions can access the platform, trade, and benefit from its services without hindrance.

The combination of these features makes EMCD not just a platform for trading but a comprehensive ecosystem that supports its users’ needs from mining to trading and learning. As the platform continues to evolve, it aims to maintain its commitment to providing secure, accessible, and user-friendly services, solidifying its position as a leading P2P exchange in the cryptocurrency space.
P2P: Pros & Cons
P2P cryptocurrency exchanges represent a significant shift away from traditional financial systems by decentralizing the control over currency trading. This model has several advantages and disadvantages, which are crucial for traders to understand.
Pros:
Decentralization

Direct Transactions: In P2P exchanges, trades occur directly between parties without the need for an intermediary. The platform only facilitates guarantees for transactions, securing them by freezing funds in escrow until the transaction is finalized. 
Personal Responsibility: Users have control over their wallets, which minimizes the risk of losing assets to hacks of platforms.

Privacy and Anonymity

Confidentiality: P2P platforms generally require less personal information from their users, which can provide higher levels of privacy.
Protection from Identity Theft: Reduced sharing of personal details helps protect against identity theft.

Cost Efficiency

No Fees: P2P platforms typically have no fees, since they don’t have to maintain expensive infrastructure or pay intermediaries.
No Middlemen: The absence of middlemen can further reduce transaction costs, making it more economical for users.


Global Access

Inclusive: P2P exchanges can offer services in regions where traditional banking is inaccessible or limited, providing more people with access to the cryptocurrency market.
No Geographical Limitations: Users can trade across borders without incurring the high fees usually associated with international transactions.

Flexible Payment Methods

Diverse Payment Options: P2P platforms often support a wide range of payment methods including bank transfers, online wallets, and even cash, making them more accessible.

Cons:
Complexity and Usability

Steep Learning Curve: New users may find P2P platforms more complex and less intuitive than centralized exchanges.
User Responsibility: The need for managing one’s own security can be daunting for some, as P2P does not provide the same level of user support as centralized platforms.

Security Concerns


Scam Risks: While escrow and reputation systems help mitigate risk, scams can still occur. Users must be vigilant and prudent in their dealings.
Dispute Resolution: Resolving disputes can be more complicated without a central authority to adjudicate conflicts.

Liquidity Issues

Variable Liquidity: Depending on the asset and the specific P2P platform, liquidity can be lower than on centralized exchanges, potentially making it harder to complete large transactions quickly.
Price Volatility: Lower liquidity can lead to higher price volatility; prices may vary more significantly than on centralized platforms.

Speed of Transactions

Dependency on Participants: Transaction speeds depend on the responsiveness of the counterparty, which can lead to delays if the other party is not prompt.
Manual Processes: The need to manually find and secure trades can slow down the process, especially for less popular assets or payment methods.


Regulatory and Legal Risks

Uncertain Regulation: The legal status of P2P trading is still unclear in many jurisdictions, which could pose risks of sudden regulatory changes affecting the ability to trade or withdraw funds.
Compliance Requirements: While anonymity is a benefit, it also places the onus on users to ensure compliance with local laws and regulations regarding taxation and cryptocurrency trading.

Conclusion
P2P platforms offer a compelling alternative to traditional and centralized cryptocurrency exchanges, especially for those valuing privacy, lower fees, and direct control over their transactions. However, these advantages come with the responsibility of managing one’s own security and the potential for less liquidity and slower trades. 
For many, the benefits of P2P exchanges outweigh the drawbacks, particularly in regions with restricted access to traditional banking services or where users seek to avoid heavy regulation. As the cryptocurrency landscape evolves, the role of P2P platforms is likely to expand, driven by increasing demand for decentralized financial services.

SEC Chair Gensler Criticizes FIT 21 Crypto Bill, Warns Of 'New Regulatory Gaps' - Benzinga

The Financial Innovation and Technology for the 21st Century Act (FIT21) would undermine investor protections and hinder the SEC’s regulatory efforts, the financial watchdog’s Chair Gary Gensler stated on Wednesday.What Happened: “FIT21 would create new regulatory gaps and undermine decades of precedent regarding the oversight of investment contracts, putting investors and capital markets at immeasurable risk,” Gensler warned.A joint effort by the House Agriculture Committee and the House Financial Services Committee, FIT21 aims to delineate the roles of the SEC and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) in overseeing cryptocurrency. The bill introduces the term “digital commodity” for digital assets not classified as securities, placing them under the CFTC’s jurisdiction.Gensler argued that FIT21 disregards long-standing regulatory precedents for investment contracts and places the SEC in a difficult position for certifying self-proclaimed digital commodity issuers. He emphasized that the bill overlooks the Supreme Court’s Howey Test precedent, compromises investor protections, and potentially exposes investors to undue risk without adequate disclosures.“U.S. securities laws, developed after the Great Depression, were designed to protect consumers by enforcing disclosures and providing tools for regulators and investors to safeguard customers,” Gensler noted. He pointed out that the crypto industry has been reluctant to comply with these established regulations.Also Read: EXCLUSIVE: Ethereum ETFs Could Drive ‘Mass Adoption’ — What Investors Need To Know NowGensler also criticized the bill for removing investment contracts recorded on a blockchain from the statutory definition of securities, thus excluding them from federal securities laws’ protections. He highlighted that this exclusion contradicts court rulings that many crypto assets are offered and sold as securities under existing laws.The bill’s provision allowing companies to self-certify as issuers of “digital commodities” is problematic, Gensler said, because it gives the SEC only 60 days to evaluate whether these assets meet the bill’s criteria—a timeframe he deemed insufficient given the vast number of digital assets in circulation.Gensler also expressed concerns about the bill’s definition of a digital commodity, which he argued ignores the Howey Test and the economic realities of assets. He cautioned that the bill’s investor protection framework and the exclusion of exchanges could increase risks to the public.Moreover, Gensler warned that FIT21 might harm the broader U.S. capital markets by enabling companies to circumvent SEC oversight through decentralized networks.The House of Representatives is expected to vote on FIT21 later on Wednesday.However, the bill faces an uncertain future in the Senate and is unlikely to become law this year.What’s Next: For further insights into regulatory developments and their impact on the digital asset space, join industry leaders at Benzinga’s Future of Digital Assets event on Nov. 19.This gathering will delve into the evolving role of digital assets in the global financial landscape.Read Next: SEC Could Approve Spot Ethereum ETF ‘This Week:’ ReportImage: Shutterstock

Gary Gensler Criticizes FIT21 Crypto Bill Before House Vote


US Security and Exchange Commission (SEC) Chair Gary Gensler has publicly opposed the Financial Innovation and Technology for the 21st Century Act (FIT21), a bill to regulate digital asset markets. He believes the bill would weaken the SEC’s ability to protect investors by reclassifying crypto assets and reducing regulatory oversight.
At the same time, The House is set to vote on the bill, which faces notable opposition and an uncertain future in the Senate.
SEC Chair Criticizes FIT21 Act for Reducing Regulatory Oversight

In a Wednesday report, Gary Gensler expressed his strong opposition to the FIT21 Act. The bill, introduced in July 2023 by Chairman Glenn “GT” Thompson and backed by several key Republicans, aims to establish clear federal guidelines for digital asset markets. It seeks to balance innovation with strong consumer protections and clarifies the SEC and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission’s (CFTC) roles in regulating cryptocurrency.
Gensler argues that the bill undermines classifying crypto assets as investment contracts. This change would remove these assets from the SEC’s oversight, making it harder to protect investors.
Read more: Crypto Regulation: What Are the Benefits and Drawbacks?

He noted that FIT21 might enable crypto firms to self-certify their products as “decentralized” digital commodities, thus avoiding SEC scrutiny. Gensler warned that the SEC’s limited resources would hinder its ability to challenge these certifications, leaving much of the crypto market unregulated.
Gensler also criticized the bill’s definition of a digital commodity. He said that it ignores the Howey Test and the economic realities of the assets. Furthermore, he warned that FIT21 could harm the broader US capital markets by allowing companies to evade SEC regulation through decentralized networks.

“The bill would remove investment contracts that are recorded on a blockchain from the statutory definition of securities and the time-tested protections of much of the federal securities laws. By removing this set of investment contracts from the statutory list of securities, the bill implies what courts have repeatedly ruled—but what crypto market participants have attempted to deny—that many crypto assets are being offered and sold as securities under existing law,” Gensler explained.

Stuart Alderoty, Ripple’s Chief Legal Officer (CLO), shared his thoughts on Gensler’s stance and current approach to crypto regulation.

“He thought he was above Congressional oversight. That’s all gone. He’s now a struggling political liability,” Alderoty said.

The House of Representatives is expected to vote on the bill on Wednesday. However, its passage through the Senate remains to be determined. If enacted, the bill would alter the Howey test and significantly reduce the SEC’s oversight of crypto assets. Introduced in 1946, the Howey Test determines if a transaction qualifies as an investment contract and, thus, a security.

At least eight House Democrats support the FIT21 Act and may gain more backers. Former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi is reportedly considering supporting the bill. Despite no longer being in Democratic leadership, Pelosi’s opinions still influence many House Democrats.
If Pelosi supports the bill, she would go against Ranking Members Democrats Maxine Waters and David Scott, who both oppose it. They express concerns that the bill would result in the mass deregulation of crypto and some traditional securities. They see this deregulation severely undermining US capital markets by removing key protections for investors and consumers.

BeInCrypto previously reported that Waters and Scott urged their colleagues to vote against the bill. However, House Democrats leaders have stated they will not whip against the FIT21 bill. As the debate continues, the vote’s outcome and its implications for the future of US crypto regulation remain uncertain.

Bitcoin Pizza Day: A $700 Million Reminder of Cryptocurrency's Rise


							

Bitcoin Pizza Day marks the first documented Bitcoin transaction, now worth $700 million



Early adopter spent over 100,000 BTC on various goods, missing out on immense potential wealth



Bitcoin, despite bearish sentiment, remains a store of value with a rich and celebrated history




On this day in 2010, Laszlo Hanyecz, a Florida-based software developer, etched his name in history by purchasing two pizzas with 10,000 Bitcoin (BTC). This marked the first documented commercial transaction using the original cryptocurrency. Five days before the purchase, Laszlo posted a request on the BitcoinTalk forum, seeking to exchange Bitcoin for pizza.



Today, with Bitcoin trading near $70,000, those two Papa John’s pizzas would be valued at over $700 million. Fourteen years ago, they cost a mere $41. This historic transaction is now commemorated annually as Bitcoin Pizza Day on May 22, a celebration of the cryptocurrency’s remarkable evolution.







In a 2019 interview with journalist Anderson Cooper, Hanyecz reflected on this transaction, noting that dwelling on the immense Bitcoin fortune exchanged for two pizzas would be counterproductive. Beyond the pizzas, Hanyecz made various other purchases with Bitcoin, spending over 100,000 BTC in total. Had he retained this amount, he could have been among the largest Bitcoin holders today.



Despite Bitcoin’s initial conception as a means of payment, it has not yet achieved widespread adoption for this purpose. However, it has thrived as a store of value, with many holders anticipating price appreciation. Recently, CoinEX launched the “One Bite of Bitcoin” campaign on Bitcoin Pizza Day, inviting the global crypto community to join in the festivities.









Currently, Bitcoin is experiencing a bearish trend. BTC price has dipped by 1.93%, now trading at $69,764. Additionally, the trading volume has declined by 22.90% to $39.98 billion. Over the past 24 hours, Bitcoin has fluctuated between a high of $71,426.98 and a low of $69,191.12.



The value of the Bitcoins spent on the pizzas is also referred to as the Bitcoin Pizza Index. This index serves as a poignant reminder of Bitcoin’s meteoric growth and its unrealized potential. The community’s celebration of Bitcoin Pizza Day underscores the significance of this transaction in the annals of cryptocurrency history.

Is the altcoin season ‘maniac phase’ about to flip on?


    Bitcoin’s (BTC) recent surge to a record $71,000, followed by a pullback, has set the stage for what many in the cryptocurrency sector believe could signal the onset of an altcoin season.



The coming two weeks are set to be pivotal for the entire altcoin industry. The United States House of Representatives is preparing to vote on the Financial Innovation and Technology for the 21st Century Act (FIT21).



Additionally, the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) is set to vote on spot Ethereum exchange-traded fund (ETF)  later this week. Speculation about the likely approval of both the FIT21 bill and the spot Ethereum ETFs has been rife, driving increased activity in the crypto markets.







At press time, the global cryptocurrency market cap stands at $2.73 trillion, a 0.45% decrease in the last 24 hours.



Market movements and trends



The cryptocurrency market began the week with strong bullish momentum, led by Ethereum’s (ETH) recent surge to $3,800, which in turn has driven notable gains across major altcoins. 



Historically, Bitcoin initiates market cycles with a robust surge, but significant action typically unfolds during its consolidation phases, where other cryptocurrencies take the lead. 



This trend is expected to become more pronounced in the upcoming period, driven by varying forecasts from leading analysts



Analysts’ insights



Prominent crypto analyst Michaël van de Poppe observed that the altcoin market cap, referred to as TOTAL2, has completed its recent correction. 







Poppe suggested that the altcoin market cap is well-positioned for a rally to retest its all-time high (ATH). Additionally, most altcoins, led by Ethereum, have broken out of a bullish flag pattern in recent days. 



Another well-known analyst, Rekt Capital, noted in a post on X (formerly Twitter) that the altcoin market cap, excluding the top 10 cryptocurrencies, has successfully retested the $250 billion level as a support level over recent weeks.

According to his analysis, the altcoin market cap is expected to surge to $315 billion before retracing back to the $250 billion mark. This retracement is projected to be followed by an explosive surge above the $440 billion market capitalization.



Investor sentiment



Prominent analyst  advise investors not to panic and to prepare for the upcoming “maniac phase.” Prominent crypto analyst Crypto Yoddha shared that the recent dip was ‘just a higher low in an uptrend.’



According to his analysis, the altcoin market is looking to retest the $1.27 trillion resistance level seen in March before aiming for the previous cycle’s $1.7 trillion all-time high. He anticipates a bullish continuation leading to a new market all-time high during the next phase.



Contrasting Signals



Despite these optimistic projections, the altcoin season index by Blockchain Center presents a contrasting view. 



According to this index:




“If 75% of the top 50 coins performed better than Bitcoin over the last season (90 days), it is Altcoin Season.” 




Currently, only 37% of the leading 50 altcoins have outperformed Bitcoin in the past 90 days, still insufficient to officially declare an altcoin season.



The cryptocurrency market stands at a critical juncture, with significant legislative decisions and market movements on the horizon. 



While many analysts are optimistic about the potential onset of a new altcoin season, contrasting indicators suggest investors should proceed with caution. 



The coming weeks will be crucial in determining the direction of the altcoin market, potentially leading to a ‘maniac phase’ or continued consolidation.

Ripple CLO Advocates For Crypto, Cites US SEC Chairman's Inefficiency | Bitcoinist.com


								Stuart Alderoty, the Chief Legal Officer (CLO) of Ripple Labs has taken a firm stand in support of the cryptocurrency landscape, scathing the Chairman of the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) Gary Gensler for his incompetence in overseeing crypto assets.
Ripple CLO Slams Gary Gensler
Today, May 22, Chris Brummer, a professor of Financial Technology at Agnes Williams Sesquicentennial noted that for the first time, the SEC has become a subject of presidential politics.
The SEC chairman Gary Gensler was called out by name by a presidential candidate, which came as a shock to the professor because this has never happened before. Another shocking development highlighted by Brummer was the US president’s Joe Biden threat to veto Congressional legislation regarding the SEC in advance.
The post read:
This is the first time the SEC has become a subject of presidential politics. I don’t recall ever a presidential candidate mentioning the Chair of the SEC by name.  I also don’t remember a sitting President threatening preemptively to veto Congressional legislation about the SEC.
Responding to the professor’s post, Stuart Alderoty, Ripple’s CLO, believes Gensler has overplayed his hand, which led to the development. Rather than promoting a balanced regulatory environment that fosters growth while safeguarding investors, Alderoty argues that Gensler’s approach mistakenly labels crypto innovation as the problem, as he thought it was an easy target.

According to the Ripple CLO, the regulatory watchdog’s chairman enjoys being the person whom everyone loved to despise. Furthermore, Alderoty draws attention to Gensler’s disdain for accountability to Congress, which is essential for efficient regulation. 
Given his status, the Ripple CLO noted that Gensler misunderstood the role of Congressional oversight in the cryptocurrency sector, believing that he was immune to congressional scrutiny. However, with all of that gone, the chairman is now a struggling political liability, suggesting that Gensler is responsible for several problems in the industry.
Alderoty has also addressed Gensler’s unauthorized overreach in the crypto industry. Following the vote against the SEC’s SAB 121 bulletin last week, the CLO stated that the event demonstrated an agreement between the Democrats and Republicans that the chairman’s unlawful crypto overreach will no longer be accepted.
Gensler Sees Heightened Criticism From Top Crypto Figures
Stuart Alderoty is not the only popular crypto figure who has slammed the SEC’s chairman’s inefficient regulation. On Tuesday, cryptocurrency market observer and Cinneamhain Ventures founder Adam Cochran also attacked Gary Gensler over his lack of clarity regarding Ethereum regulations.

Cochran strongly believes that Ethereum is not a security, unlike the SEC, which thinks the asset fails under the securities law. Thus, Cochran insisted that Gensler explain this in court, calling on Coinbase’s CLO Paul Grewal to make this demand.
This might imply that the founder believes that Gensler might be unable to defend his claims that ETH is a security, asserting that his collapse would be historic.

Neither the author, Tim Fries, nor this website, The Tokenist, provide financial advice. Please consult our website policy prior to making financial decisions.



Analog Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ: ADI) reported its financial results for the fiscal second quarter of 2024, which ended on May 4, 2024, showcasing a robust performance despite challenging macroeconomic conditions. The company reported revenue of $2.16 billion, exceeding its outlook’s midpoint. This performance highlights the resilience of Analog Devices’ business model, even amidst ongoing inventory headwinds. The operating cash flow for the quarter was a significant $4.3 billion, with free cash flow reaching $3.1 billion on a trailing twelve-month basis.



Analog Devices also returned over $675 million to shareholders through dividends and stock repurchases during the second quarter. Vincent Roche, CEO and Chair of Analog Devices, emphasized the company’s ability to achieve profitability and earnings per share above the high end of their outlook. Roche noted that the stabilization of inventory rationalization across their broad customer base and improving new orders positions the company well for sequential growth in the upcoming quarters.



Analog Devices Beats EPS and Revenue Expectations with $1.40 Adj. EPS and $2.16 Billion in Revenue for Fiscal Q2



When comparing the actual performance to market expectations, Analog Devices surpassed revenue predictions but fell short on earnings per share (EPS). The market had anticipated an EPS of $1.26 and revenue of $2.1 billion. However, Analog Devices reported an EPS of $0.61, significantly lower than expected, while revenue came in at $2.16 billion, slightly above expectations.



Despite the lower-than-expected EPS, the company’s adjusted EPS was reported at $1.40, which is above the market expectation, indicating strong underlying performance when excluding certain one-time costs and adjustments. The gross margin for the quarter was 54.7%, down from 65.7% in the same quarter last year, reflecting the challenging operating environment. Adjusted gross margin stood at 66.7%, down from 73.7% year-over-year. These figures underscore the operational efficiencies and cost management strategies that Analog Devices has implemented to mitigate external pressures.





Analog Devices Expects Fiscal 2024 Revenue to Be Between $2.17 Billion and $2.27 Billion



Analog Devices provided optimistic guidance for the third quarter of fiscal 2024. The company forecasts revenue to be around $2.27 billion, plus or minus $100 million. At the midpoint of this revenue outlook, the company expects a reported operating margin of approximately 20.1%, with an adjusted operating margin of around 40.0%. This guidance reflects the company’s confidence in its ability to drive growth and profitability in the coming months.



Analog Devices also projected reported EPS to be $0.71, plus or minus $0.10, and adjusted EPS to be $1.50, plus or minus $0.10. This outlook is based on current expectations and takes into account the ongoing economic uncertainties and inventory dynamics.

Ethereum ETF Excitement Sparks Bitcoin and Altcoin Surge


							

Standard Chartered predicts Bitcoin will surpass its $73,798 record this week.



The potential green light for an Ethereum ETF fuels optimism, driving Bitcoin’s price surge.



Ethereum and memecoins like Pepe and Floki are also experiencing significant gains amidst renewed bullish sentiment.




Geoff Kendrick, the Head of FX Research and Digital Assets Research at Standard Chartered, has predicted a new all-time high (ATH) for Bitcoin by the coming weekend. Kendrick noted in an interview that the flagship crypto would surpass the current $73,798 ATH, achieved on March 14, before the weekend is over.



Citing the potential approval of an Ethereum exchange-traded fund (ETF) this week, the research expert believes it would further legitimize the crypto sector, boosting Bitcoin’s adoption. He asserts that this week’s anticipated new high aligns with his $150,000 target for Bitcoin by year-end and a $200,000 target by December 2025.



Kendrick highlighted the renewed optimism among spot Bitcoin ETF investors, which has invigorated the ecosystem. This has led to increased inflows, bringing the total value to $12.9 billion at the time of the interview. Data from Soso Value shows this figure has since risen to $13.17 billion.



Bitcoin embarked on a significant rally following a recent notice by the U.S. Security and Exchange Commission (SEC), requesting updates to 19b-4 filings for spot Ethereum. The SEC’s request signaled potential progress toward an Ethereum ETF approval. It also increased the chances of approval from 25% to 75% based on the crypto industry’s sentiments.









Beyond Bitcoin, many altcoins also rallied, signaling a resurgence of bullish sentiment. Pepe and Floki led the memecoin rally, outperforming other cryptocurrencies. Pepe spiked by 59% in the past 48 hours, while Floki gained 30%.



Most notably, Ethereum, the flagship altcoin, broke out of a 5-week range to rally 26% in the past 48 hours. With the surge, Ethereum climbed above multiple resistances, opening the way for retesting this year’s high of $4,093, which it established in March. ETH traded for $3,754 at the time of writing, having retraced slightly from yesterday’s $3,841 high, according to data from TradingView.

Breakneck Growth: Polygon (MATIC) Surpasses 4 Billion Transactions


								Polygon, the Ethereum scaling solution aiming to solve the network’s scalability woes, has blasted past a monumental milestone: 4 billion total transactions. This achievement is particularly impressive considering the network launched just four years ago in June 2020. Bitcoin, for comparison, took a staggering 15 years to reach 1 billion transactions, highlighting the breakneck speed of Polygon’s adoption.

User Surge Fuels Polygon’s Growth Engine
This meteoric rise isn’t just a vanity metric. The number of daily active users on the network paints a vibrant picture of a thriving ecosystem. Since March 19th, Polygon has boasted a streak of over 60 days with an average of over 1 million daily active users.


This surge in user activity is likely fueled by the popularity of decentralized applications (dApps) built on Polygon. Popular names like Matr1x, a mobile-first play-to-earn game, and Galxe, a burgeoning digital identity network, are attracting users and driving transaction volume.

However, despite this impressive network growth, the price of MATIC, Polygon’s native token, hasn’t mirrored the enthusiasm. Over the past year, MATIC has remained largely range-bound between $0.5 and $1, significantly underperforming the broader crypto market. This disconnect between network activity and token price has some scratching their heads.

Unpacking The MATIC Price Mystery
Analysts offer a few explanations for this price conundrum. As more users flock to Polygon’s dApps, the demand for MATIC, needed to interact with them, should rise in turn. This could lead to a long-term price appreciation for MATIC. However, others point to the sheer volume of tokens in circulation (over 10 billion) as a potential damper on price increases.

Another factor is the competition. While Polygon is the leading Ethereum scaling solution, other blockchains like Solana boast even higher transaction volumes (over 290 billion in a similar timeframe).

The Future Of Polygon: A Balancing Act
Despite the current price stagnation, experts remain cautiously optimistic about Polygon’s future. The network’s rapid growth and user adoption are undeniable positives. The team behind Polygon is also actively working on scaling solutions and attracting new dApps to its ecosystem.
If they can successfully navigate the competitive landscape and translate network activity into real value for users, MATIC could finally escape its downward trend and embark on a sustained journey upwards.

Dheeraj Borra, co-founder of Kelp DAO, expressed excitement about the fundraising success, stating:




“This fundraise propels our expansion in the market and sharpens our focus on building customer centric solutions. It’s truly thrilling to have our investors share that vision.” 




Borra’s colleagues, such as Jez Mohideen, CEO of Laser Digital, and Jack Platts, co-founder of Hypersphere Ventures, echoed his enthusiasm, emphasising the passion behind Kelp’s team and expressing excitement for the prospect of restaking enabling more developer experimentation and use cases. 



Fueling investor confidence in DeFi restaking

Oracle Protocols: Bridging the Gap Between Blockchain and the Real World - Coin Edition


							

Oracle protocols bridge the gap between blockchain and real-world data, enhancing the functionality of decentralized applications.



Flare Network integrates Oracle capabilities directly into its blockchain, providing a robust environment for advanced smart contracts.



Arthur Hayes highlights the competition among leading oracle protocols, noting Flare’s potential to revolutionize the industry.




Blockchain technology, known for its decentralized nature, thrives on accurate and reliable data. However, to fully leverage its potential, blockchain applications require information from the real world—data typically not available on the blockchain itself. Oracle protocols provide a solution to this challenge, acting as the critical link between off-chain and on-chain data.



What Are Oracle Protocols?



Oracle protocols are specialized software systems that serve as intermediaries between blockchain networks and external data sources. They enable blockchain applications to utilize real-world data, which is essential for decentralized applications (dApps) to operate effectively. Without oracles, blockchains would remain isolated and unable to access external information necessary for various applications.



Oracles retrieve, verify, and transmit data from outside sources to the blockchain securely and reliably. This process is crucial for smart contracts, which depend on accurate and timely data to function correctly. For example, oracles can provide real-time price feeds from traditional markets to decentralized finance (DeFi) platforms, enabling services like lending, borrowing, and trading based on up-to-date market data.



Furthermore, Oracle Protocols empower dApps to make informed decisions based on real-world events. Whether tracking the condition of goods in a supply chain, determining the outcome of a sports event for a betting platform, or triggering an insurance policy based on weather conditions, oracles connect blockchain technology with real-world data, enhancing the practical application and effectiveness of dApps.



How Oracles Link On-Chain and Off-Chain Data



Oracles facilitate a seamless flow of information between blockchain environments and external data sources. The process begins with an off-chain source, such as a web API, database, or sensor in a connected device. The oracle retrieves this data and verifies its accuracy and reliability through multiple stages to minimize the risk of manipulation or errors.



In decentralized oracle networks like Chainlink, this verification process involves collecting and cross-checking the same data from multiple nodes. These nodes compare their results and reach a consensus before the verified data is transmitted to the blockchain. Financial incentives, such as staking and rewards schemes, align node operators’ interests with the accuracy of the data they provide.









The confirmed data is then relayed to the blockchain, where it can be used by smart contracts and other dApps. This relay process often includes additional security measures to ensure the data remains untampered. Cryptographic methods can secure the data during transmission, and time-stamping techniques ensure the data is current and relevant.



Accuracy and data integrity are paramount in this process. The reliability of smart contracts and dApps depends on the correctness of the data they use. Incorrect or outdated information from an oracle can lead to erroneous contract executions, financial losses, or other unintended outcomes. Therefore, oracles employ rigorous methods to retrieve, verify, and transmit data, ensuring blockchain applications operate as intended and make sound decisions based on the most accurate data.



How Flare Network Uses Oracle Technology



Flare Network is a protocol that integrates smart contract technology with Oracle capabilities. Unlike traditional oracles that provide data to blockchains, Flare incorporates these features directly into its blockchain architecture. This integration creates a robust environment for building and managing smart contracts with reliable data.



Flare’s approach involves validators within its network who are responsible for obtaining and verifying external data, ensuring network integrity, and earning rewards for their contributions. Key components of Flare include the Flare Time Series Oracle (FTSO) and the Data Connector. The Data Connector allows Flare to access data from various external sources, including other blockchains and online services, while the FTSO handles time-sensitive data, which is crucial for applications needing real-time information.



By offering these integrated features, Flare facilitates the development of advanced and versatile smart contracts. The network’s ability to gather and process data streams from multiple sources ensures the accuracy and timeliness of the information available, promoting the creation of applications that depend on precise and up-to-date data without additional costs.



Insights from Arthur Hayes



Arthur Hayes, in his article “Igniting the Oracle Wars: Keep an Eye on Flare,” discusses the competition among leading oracle protocols—Chainlink, Pyth, and Flare. As blockchain applications grow more complex, the importance of oracles increases, making this competition critical.



Chainlink, the industry leader, benefits from a robust network and extensive integrations. However, it faces challenges with speed and managing large data volumes, as well as centralized price feed management. Pyth excels in providing rapid, precise price updates, particularly useful for financial applications.



Flare combines the strengths of both Chainlink and Pyth, offering unique features like the Data Connector and FTSO. This integration directly links Oracle services with its smart contract platform, allowing Flare to generate revenue from both data services and smart contracts. Hayes predicts that the protocol that best handles future challenges, such as managing large datasets for AI applications, will dominate the “Oracle Wars.” Although Chainlink currently leads, Flare’s innovative approach and expanding ecosystem position it as a formidable competitor.



Conclusion



Oracle protocols are essential in the blockchain ecosystem. They enable smart contracts to utilize real-world data, thus enhancing the flexibility and utility of decentralized applications. As blockchain technology continues to evolve, Oracles will play a crucial role in supporting more sophisticated and diverse applications. Keeping abreast of advancements in Oracle technology is vital, especially with emerging protocols like Flare that have the potential to transform the industry and drive new innovations.

Ethereum ETF Launch Potentially Still Weeks Away, Says Bloomberg Analyst - Benzinga

Bloomberg analyst James Seyffart on Monday pointed out that the listing of spot Ethereum ETFs could be weeks or even longer away, despite recent developments.What Haeppened: At least five potential spot Ethereum ETH/USD ETF issuers, including Fidelity, VanEck, Invesco/Galaxy, Ark/21Shares and Franklin, have filed their amended 19b-4s through CBOE.These amendments primarily involve the removal of staking-related content, emphasizing that the Fund’s ETH cannot be staked by anyone.In his tweet, Seyffart stated, “It’s happening. We have at least 5 of the potential Ethereum ETF issuers that have submitted their Amended 19b-4’s in the last ~25 min. Fidelity, VanEck, Invesco/Galaxy, Ark/21Shares, & Franklin all submitted via CBOE.”Despite these submissions, Seyffart noted that the launch of these ETFs might still be a long way off. “Still a potentially long way from a launch. But these filings prove that all of the rumors and speculation and chatter have been accurate. Need to actually see SEC approval orders on all the 19b-4s AND THEN we need to see S-1 approvals. Could be weeks or more before ETFs launch,” he explained.The only substantial change identified in the revised filings was the removal of staking language. Seyffart said, “This is the only meaningful & substantial change that I can find? Removing the staking language and adding very clear language that the Fund’s ETH cannot be staked by anyone.”Despite these modifications, the approval odds remain at 75%, as highlighted by Seyffart, though he added, “Not that it even means anything anymore haha.”Also Read: EXCLUSIVE: Ethereum ETFs Could Drive ‘Mass Adoption’ — What Investors Need To Know NowAdding to the complexity, Scott Johnsson of Van Buren Capital highlighted the extensive review process the SEC typically undertakes. He explained that the SEC’s review of BTC spot and futures S-1s took several months, suggesting a similar timeline could apply here.Johnsson said, “SEC spent nearly 4 months reviewing and iterating BTC spot S-1s and 5 months reviewing BTC futures S-1s. If Division of Corporation Finance indeed was told about this potential approval yesterday, then they’re likely just getting started. Nothing about this situation is straightforward, so difficult to know how quickly they try to push forward this process.”What’s Next: The implications of these developments and other regulatory trends in the digital asset space will be further explored at Benzinga’s Future of Digital Assets event on Nov. 19.This event will bring together industry leaders, investors, and policymakers to discuss the evolving role of digital assets in the global financial landscape.Read Next: SEC Could Approve Spot Ethereum ETF ‘This Week:’ ReportImage: Shutterstock

WisdomTree's Bitcoin, Ethereum ETPs to debut on London Stock Exchange next week - Crypto Briefing


            
            
                            
            
                            
            
            WisdomTree, a global exchange-traded fund (ETF) and exchange-traded product (ETP) sponsor, has secured the Financial Conduct Authority’s (FCA) approval to list its WisdomTree Physical Bitcoin and WisdomTree Physical Ethereum ETPs on the London Stock Exchange (LSE), according to a press release published today. The listing, expected to occur on May 28, will initially cater exclusively to professional investors.As previously reported by Crypto Briefing, May 28 is also expected to be the debut date of Bitcoin and Ethereum exchange-traded notes (ETNs) on the LSE.This move positions WisdomTree among the first to receive FCA endorsement for a crypto ETP prospectus. Institutions in Europe can now gain exposure to crypto backed by Bitcoin and Ethereum, respectively, via these ETPs.With a Total Expense Ratio (TER) of just 0.35%, WisdomTree’s upcoming crypto ETPs are among the most cost-efficient options for investors in the region.Commenting on the latest development, Alexis Marinof, Head of Europe at WisdomTree, said the FCA approval not only facilitates easier access for UK investors but also removes the regulatory hurdles that previously discouraged investors from entering the market.“While UK-based professional investors have been able to allocate to crypto ETPs via overseas exchanges, they will soon have a more convenient access point,” Marinof stated.“FCA approval in this respect could result in greater institutional adoption of the asset class, as many professional investors have been unable to gain exposure to Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies due to regulatory limitations and uncertainty – we would expect FCA approval of our crypto ETPs’ prospectus to remove those barriers to entry,” he added.WisdomTree’s commitment to providing secure, regulated investment vehicles for crypto assets began in 2019 with the launch of the WisdomTree Physical Bitcoin ETP.The firm has since expanded its offerings to encompass a suite of eight physically backed crypto ETPs. These ETPs provide exposure to both individual cryptocurrencies and diversified baskets, and are available for trading on multiple European exchanges.In March this year, WisdomTree announced it secured the New York State Department of Financial Services (NYDFS) approval to operate as a New York limited-purpose trust company charter. This development allows WisdomTree to offer fiduciary custody of digital assets, issue DFS-approved stablecoins, and manage stablecoin reserves.[Update with context in the second paragraph]

GameStop Price Crashes, Buy The Dip Or Sell GME? This Solana Meme Coin ICO Raises / Cryptonews
                        Just over one week on from legendary GameStop investor Roaring Kitty’s abrupt return to social media for the first time since 2021, the GameStop (GME) price has crashed, with retail investors asking whether now might be the time to buy the dip or sell GME.The GameStop price rallied as high as $65 last Tuesday but has since crashed back to $22.That leaves it barely 20% above its levels from before Roaring Kitty’s return.Roaring Kitty was a leading figure in the 2021 meme stock craze, during which time GME was a leading stock.The 2021 meme stock craze was viewed by many as a retail investor-led movement against Wall Street hegemony.Hopes remain high amongst retail investors that Roaring Kitty’s return could catalyze a new meme stock season.US Presidential candidate Robert F Kennedy even announced on Monday that he had invested $24,000 in GME.But macro conditions likely don’t warrant a repeat of 2021 meme stock mania.The US government isn’t currently handing out stimulus cheques.And while US equity markets are pushing on to new record highs, interest rates remain at multi-decade highs.Recent years of inflation plus high interest rates have put a major squeeze on retail investor spending firepower.Also, there is good reason to be bearish on the GameStop price. GME is an inflationary asset – the company last week announced a new stock sale.Meanwhile, the company continues to run at a loss and cut jobs as it struggles with e-commerce competitors.GME Investors Should Instead Consider Meme Coins 
Traders looking to make speculative bets on assets that could see huge market hype-driven gains can do better than GME.As noted above, the outlook for the GameStop price isn’t necessarily good as it has bad fundamentals and is inflationary.Its also got a bloated market cap of around $6.5 billion.For a company that probably isn’t worth anything in real life, that’s potentially a very large overvaluation.And that reduces the likelihood of anything more than 5x gains this bull cycle.Traders considering GME should instead consider crypto meme coins.Top meme coins like Dogecoin, Shiba Inu and Pepe are likely to continue to grow as crypto technology is adopted.However, their bloated market caps suggest that they also have limited room for upside.Luckily, new meme coins are popping up every day. While most are scams or pump-and-dumps, savvy traders may be able to uncover hidden 100x gems.One such coin that analysts at Cryptonews are very bullish on is Solana meme coin ICO Sealana (SEAL).Sealana (SEAL) – The Best Solana Meme Coin ICO Right Now
South Park-themed Seal cartoon character Sealana has been generating huge excitement since launching its presale.The new Solana meme coin ICO features an overweight, Solana meme coin trading degen seal called Sealana.The loveable seal mascot has already attracted over $2.35 million in funds from early investors.Strong demand is no surprise given the strong traction Sealana has been getting across socials.Sealana has already garnered over 5,000 X followers, as well as over 5,000 on Telegram.Sealana’s marketing and presale success is reminiscent of the recently launched Solana meme coin Slothana (SLOTH).Slothana raised over $15 million in a similar presale. However, it then went on to pump to a market cap of over $100 million, as per DEXTools.Presale investors were up over 5x within just a few days of the token’s launch. That more than could likely be expected from the GameStop price in the near future.SLOTH also just launched on the top-ten crypto exchange HTX. This could lead to a new push higher in its price as new retail investors flood in.Amid rumors that the Slothana and Sealana teams are related, traders will hope SEAL’s success matches SLOTH’s.If Sealana can quickly secure exchange listings post-launch like SLOTH, it could easily be the best new Solana meme coin ICO to buy right now.Investors can buy their SEAL by connecting their web3 wallet on Sealana’s official website with SOL, ETH, USDT, or USDC. Sealana is also available for purchase via card.Buy Sealana Here

Bitcoin Price Alert: 273,000 BTC Held at Key Bitcoin Supply Range

As Bitcoin teeters near $70,000, analysts are closely watching a critical supply zone for the largest cryptocurrency. This range is crucial because it represents a key area where a substantial amount of Bitcoin was acquired.Crypto analyst Ali has identified a key supply zone for Bitcoin, situated between $70,180 and $70,600, where over 450,000 addresses have collectively acquired approximately 273,000 BTC.  The supply zone is an important area on the price chart that often acts as a barrier to upward price movements. It is where a large number of Bitcoin was previously bought, and holders may look to break even or take profits, potentially leading to increased selling pressure. Following a steady rebound from May 1 lows of $56,500, Bitcoin reached highs of $71,980 on May 21 before encountering resistance. At the time of writing, BTC was sustaining its declines from the prior day, down 1.91% in the last 24 hours to $69,998. Potential scenariosAs Bitcoin approaches the highlighted critical supply zone, several scenarios could unfold:If Bitcoin manages to break above the $70,600 level with strong volume, it could signal a continuation of the bullish trend. This would likely attract additional buyers, pushing the price higher and potentially establishing a new support level.On the other hand, if Bitcoin faces significant selling pressure within this range, it could lead to a price rejection and subsequent pullback. This scenario would indicate that many holders want to realize profits, resulting in temporary resistance.Another possibility is that Bitcoin consolidates below this range for a while. This would imply a balance between buyers and sellers ahead of a major price movement.As Bitcoin considers its next move, price behavior around the $70,000 mark would be closely watched given the sheer volume of BTC accumulated in this area. Based on the MVRV Pricing Bands, Ali believes that if Bitcoin continues to trade above $65,125, the next local BTC peak before a temporary drop around $77,593.

Ethereum Spot ETFs: When Will They Begin Trading In The Event Of An SEC Approval? | Bitcoinist.com


								Bloomberg analyst James Seyffart has provided insights into when the Spot Ethereum ETFs could begin trading if the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) were to approve these funds. Based on his remarks, it could take weeks to months before these funds launch, even if an approval would come this week. 
S-1 Filings Need To Be Approved Before Trading Can Commence 
Seyffart mentioned in an X (formerly Twitter) post that the S-1 approvals are needed before the Spot Ethereum ETFs can go live and that it could take “weeks to months” for this approval to come in. He made this statement while clarifying that their 75% approval odds only related to the deadline for the 19b-4 filings, with VanEck’s and Ark 21Shares’ final deadline coming up on May 23 and 24, respectively. 

Seyffart and his colleague Eric Balchunas predict that the SEC will likely approve at least VanEck’s application on or before May 23 since this is the final deadline for the Commission to decide on it. Before now, the SEC was expected to deny these applications, mainly because there were reports that it considered Ethereum a security. 
However, Balchunas revealed in an X post that the Commission had become willing to approve these funds due to an “increasingly political issue.” The SEC has already shown a willingness to approve these funds, having informed Nasdaq, the Chicago Board Options Exchange (CBOE), and the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) to update their filings.
Insiders have also claimed that the SEC’s feedback to these exchanges is a positive signal and shows that the regulator might be ready to approve these investment funds. Steven McClurg, the head of US asset management for CoinShares, also told Reuters that it could take months for the Ethereum ETFs to begin trading since, unlike the exchange filings, there is no set timeframe for the SEC to approve the registration filings.  
However, the SEC has shown that it can approve both the 19b-4 and S-1 filings simultaneously, just like it did with the Spot Bitcoin ETFs, which immediately went live thanks to this. The only difference between then and now is that the SEC constantly communicated with the issuers weeks before the Bitcoin ETFs were approved. 
Fidelity And Grayscale Remove Staking Plans From Ethereum Spot ETFs
Asset managers Fidelity and Grayscale have removed their staking plans in their updated S1-filings. This was expected, considering that the staking feature is a huge part of why the SEC is rumored to consider ETH a security. However, removing this staking offering again suggests that the SEC will approve these funds as long as ETH staking isn’t included. 

Meanwhile, Seyffart noted in an X post that their approval odds still stand at 75% since the removal of the staking plans was expected.  
At the time of writing, Ethereum is trading around $3,700, up over 3% in the last 24 hours, according to data from CoinMarketCap.

Crypto Analyst Alex Krüger Revises Ethereum Outlook Amid SEC Rumors | Cryptoglobe


                                
On 21 May 2024, prominent macroeconomist and crypto analyst Alex Krüger provided new insights on social media platform X (formerly known as Twitter) regarding the potential for the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to approve spot Ethereum ETFs. Krüger, who founded the asset management and advisory firm Aike Capital, offered a detailed analysis reflecting the rapidly changing sentiment in the cryptocurrency market.



Until this week, Krüger had been pessimistic about the likelihood of the SEC approving any spot Ethereum ETFs this year or soon. However, recent developments have prompted a reevaluation. On 20 May 2024, Bloomberg ETF analysts Eric Balchunas and James Seyffart significantly increased their estimated odds of SEC approval for spot ETH ETFs from 25% to 75%. This adjustment was based on emerging rumors suggesting that the SEC might be reconsidering its stance, driven by political considerations.



Balchunas shared the updated odds on X, noting that the shift was fueled by afternoon chatter indicating a possible reversal in the SEC’s approach to this increasingly politicized issue. This unexpected development has caused market participants to scramble to adjust their positions, many of whom had previously assumed that ETF approvals would be denied.







In his analysis, Krüger acknowledged the potential impact of these rumors. He stated that his base case scenario had been:



Bitcoin rising significantly by the end of the year.Ethereum underperforming due to the expected rejection of spot ETH ETF proposals by the SEC.Ethereum outperforming post the U.S. presidential elections in November 2024, driven by a potential change in SEC leadership and subsequent approval of spot ETH ETFs in 2025.



However, the possibility of an SEC approval, possibly as early as this week, could accelerate these timelines. Krüger emphasized that the market had not fully priced in such an approval, suggesting that Ethereum could see a substantial rally if the approval were granted.







            
            

            
            

            
            

        

Krüger explained that the current market movements were primarily driven by repositioning and the closing of short positions, as the possibility of an SEC approval caught many off guard. He predicted that if approval were granted, it would lead to significant inflows into Ethereum, potentially pushing its price to all-time highs (ATHs).



He cautioned against underestimating the potential for approval, highlighting that such a decision could reinvigorate bullish sentiment and cause Ethereum to lead the market. Despite the day’s rally, he pointed out that ETH/BTC was still down year-to-date, indicating room for further growth.







Krüger also touched on the political dynamics influencing the SEC’s stance. He suggested that the seeming shift in the SEC’s approach might be politically driven, possibly influenced by the upcoming elections and the need to counteract former President Donald Trump’s recent pro-crypto stance.



He noted that if the SEC rejects the spot ETH ETF proposals, which he now views as unlikely, the market could experience significant pain. He advised traders to stay alert and monitor developments closely until the SEC’s decision on May 23rd.







Krüger also delvec into the political dynamics influencing the SEC’s stance. He posits that the seeming change in the SEC’s approach may be driven by top Democratic party members, potentially influenced by the upcoming elections. He believes this shift could be a reaction to former President Donald Trump’s recent support for cryptocurrency, forcing a strategic move from the Democrats to not appear anti-crypto.

Bonk Price Prediction as Millionaire Trader TheCryptoDog Says BONK is About to Rally - Time to Buy?

                        The Bonk price has risen by almost 1% today, reaching $0.00003187 as the wider crypto market drops by 0.5% in the past 24 hours.BONK is now up by 31% in a week and by 54% in a month, with the Solana-based meme token also up by a whopping 7,900% in a year.And these gains come at a time when prominent trader TheCryptoDog has suggested that attention is turning to BONK, presaging a possible rally in the near future.Bonk Price Prediction as Millionaire Trader TheCryptoDog Says BONK is About to Rally – Time to Buy?
Bonk is showing some signs of a minor correction after the surging of the past couple of days, with its indicators reflecting a dip in momentum.In particular, its RSI (purple) has declined from 85 on Sunday/Monday almost 50 today, with the coin having plenty of room to slip further before becoming decidedly oversold.Source: TradingViewHaving said that, its other indicators don’t seem too bad, with its 30-day average (orange) still rising steadily beyond the 200-day average (blue), even if it isn’t rising quite as steeply today.What’s particularly positive is that BONK’s volume remains high at just over $800 million, up from $180 million only a few days ago.Also bullish are BONK’s resistance (red) and support (green) levels, which are both rising in parallel, suggesting that the coin will trade within a consistently rising band.Much of the coin’s increased volume has come from renewed interest from whales, as recent data indicates.Such interest could continue for a while yet, with the wider market looking as though it’s entering a new bull phase.This is largely because the SEC looks ready to approve several spot-based Ethereum ETFs, with the deadline for a batch coming tomorrow.While any approval will not directly affect BONK, it will at least boost market-wide bullishness, thereby helping the Bonk price.And for some traders, BONK looks likelier than many other meme tokens to rally in the very near future.This is the opinion of TheCryptoDog, for instance, who has recently posted on X that the coin seems to be attracting more interest than many of its rivals.As such, we may see the Bonk price reach $0.000035 in the next few weeks, before potentially returning to its ATH of $0.00004547 by Q4.New Meme Tokens Could Bring Bigger Rallies
Bonk does look ready to surge in the near future, yet it’s not the only Solana-based meme token with good potential right now.There are also a range of presale tokens that are gaining hype and momentum, with some of these likely to perform very well once they list.A prime candidate is Sealana (SEAL), a new meme coin that has raised just over $2.3 million in its increasingly popular sale.Aiming to follow in the footsteps of BONK, WIF and other out-performing Solana-based meme coins, SEAL is already attracting a sizeable following online.This is partly thanks to its meme stylings, with the token adopting a gun-toting yet amiable seal as its anthropomorphic mascot.One interesting feature of Sealana is that it will actually be a multi-chain meme coin, with an Ethereum version of the token already live.Given the early success of its presale, it’s likely to enjoy a big listing once it launches in the next few weeks.In the meantime, investors can still buy it via its presale by going to the official Sealana website.It’s available at a conversion rate 1 SOL for 6,900 SEAL, which is roughly worth $0.026 per token.VIDEOIt may quickly supersede such a price once it goes live, potentially turning itself into a rival of BONK and other SOL-based coins.Buy SEAL Today

Kangamoon presale nears 7M as Uniswap (UNI) price jumps on response to SEC's Wells Notice - CoinJournal



                    

                    
The robust rebuttal from Uniswap against the SEC’s allegations has sent shockwaves through the crypto market.
The price of Uniswap (UNI) surged to a high of $9.67 following the news of the tough response.
As UNI price rises, another new altcoin Kangamoon (KANG) is also making waves as its presale nears $7M.

The Uniswap (UNI) price is soaring following Uniswap Labs’ formidable response to the SEC’s Wells Notice. Although the token has slightly pulled back, it surged by more than 30% immediately after the news of the response broke.
The response has not only bolstered investor confidence in the decentralized finance (DeFi) sector but also ignited positive sentiment for other altcoins, notably Kangamoon (KANG), which is currently in the midst of its presale.
The 40-page response to SEC’s Wells Notice
Uniswap Labs filed a comprehensive 40-page response to the SEC’s Wells Notice, vehemently contesting the agency’s claims that Uniswap’s operations may violate US securities laws.
The decentralized crypto exchange argued against potential lawsuits, urging the SEC to reconsider its stance. Uniswap refuted the SEC’s assertions, labeling them as “weak” and citing court rulings that contradicted the agency’s legal arguments.
Moreover, Uniswap challenged the SEC’s expansive interpretation of securities laws, emphasizing that the agency’s allegations were based on unreasonable extensions of key definitions such as securities, exchanges, and contracts.
The platform also highlighted that the majority of its trading volume did not involve securities, as per the SEC’s own standards, and that most of its users were from outside the US, potentially exempting them from US securities laws.
The new meme coin making waves alongside Uniswap (UNI)
As Uniswap continues its legal battle with the SEC, another project, Kangamoon, is making waves in the crypto space with its unique approach to meme coins and community engagement.
Kangamoon aims to establish itself as a prominent meme coin while integrating elements of SocialFi and Play To Earn (P2E).
The project promises an immersive gaming experience where players can earn rewards in the form of $KANG tokens and exclusive NFTs by participating in challenges and competitions.
Currently in its presale phase, Kangamoon has already raised a significant amount of nearing the $7 million mark.
Notably, the presale offers early investors an opportunity to acquire $KANG tokens at a favorable price before the official launch of the platform. It has garnered attention from investors and enthusiasts alike, drawn to its innovative concept and potential for community-driven growth.
Participants in the Kangamoon presale can look forward to claiming their tokens once the presale concludes.
The project’s team has assured that detailed instructions for token claiming will be provided through various channels, including the official website, social media platforms, newsletters, and Telegram.
Conclusion
The surge in Uniswap (UNI) price following Uniswap Labs’ response to the SEC’s Wells Notice has injected optimism into the cryptocurrency market, benefiting projects like Kangamoon whose presale is underway.
As both crypto projects navigate regulatory challenges and strive for success, they exemplify the resilience and innovation inherent in the crypto space.

DOT Explodes Above $7.5 but Watch This Metric Closely: Polkadot Price Analysis


																Polkadot has recently witnessed a surge in demand, leading to a price uptick that has breached its previous swing high and broken through a multi-month descending trendline. The price is now approaching the upper boundary of its consolidation range and is on the brink of surpassing it.
Technical Analysis
By Shayan
The Daily Chart
A detailed analysis of Polkadot’s daily chart shows that after a prolonged phase of sideways consolidation, a renewed spike in demand has pushed the price higher. This surge has allowed Polkadot to break through several key resistance levels, including a descending multi-month trendline, the prior swing high of $7.47, and the 200-day moving average.
Now, the price is approaching the upper boundary of this long-standing range and is on the verge of breaking above it.
If the buyers manage to push above this range, it could signal the beginning of a sustained bullish trend. However, if selling pressure intensifies, a bearish reversal towards the lower boundary is possible. The price action around this crucial resistance zone will determine Polkadot’s short-term trajectory.
Source: TradingView
The 4-Hour Chart
In the 4-hour timeframe, Polkadot’s recent bullish momentum is more evident, with the price experiencing a 12% impulsive spike towards a significant resistance area.
This critical range is bounded by the 0.5 ($7.415) and the 0.618 ($7.821) Fibonacci levels. Nevertheless, the price has been fluctuating within an ascending wedge pattern for an extended period, and following the recent surge in demand, it is now slightly retracing towards its upper boundary.
If the buyers can breach the substantial resistance at $7.8, the next target will be the upper boundary of the wedge in the mid-term.
Conversely, a bearish reversal could lead to another downward move, aiming for the wedge’s lower boundary. A decisive breakout from the wedge pattern is necessary to determine Polkadot’s upcoming direction.

Sentiment Analysis
By Shayan
Polkadot’s price has recently experienced a notable surge, raising expectations of a potential mid-term bullish trend. Hence, analyzing the futures market sentiment is crucial to assess whether this uptrend will persist, as futures market positions are significant drivers of volatility.
This chart illustrates the funding rate and open interest metrics alongside Polkadot’s daily price movements. Despite the recent bullish surge, both open interest and funding rates have not shown a significant increase and remain near their lowest levels. This suggests that the recent price action was not driven by increased bullish activity in the perpetual markets.
While Polkadot’s price has surged, the sustainability of this uptrend depends on the futures market sentiment. If open interest and funding rates begin to rise, it will signal strong bullish momentum, potentially solidifying the uptrend. Conversely, if these metrics remain low, the uptrend may lack the necessary support for long-term continuation. Traders should closely watch these indicators to better understand the market’s direction in the coming weeks.

AI predicts XRP price for August 1, 2024


    With many assets in the cryptocurrency sector starting to stagnate after recent bullish price action, the same is happening to XRP, but artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms predict further improvements for this crypto asset in the following several months.



As it happens, XRP has halted its bullish advances from the previous days and has dropped back below the previously surpassed critical price level at $0.53, demonstrating the beginning of a consolidation noticeable in other assets in the crypto market as well.



XRP price prediction



Specifically, one of the popular AI algorithms, which takes into account historical XRP price movements, technical analysis (TA) indicators, chart patterns, and other relevant factors, has set the price of XRP on August 1, 2024, at $0.384764, which would suggest a drop of 27.29% from its current price.







3-month XRP price prediction. Source: CoinCodex



Elsewhere, the newest model of the OpenAI invention ChatGPT, called GPT-4o, has set the price of XRP for August 1, 2024, in the range of $1.24 – $3.30, taking into account both “median expert expectations [and] bullish predictions and favorable legal outcomes,” as well as supply, demand, and market dynamics. 



Additionally, the recent Anthropic AI model, Claude 3 Opus, has offered the XRP price prediction in the range of $0.838 – $2.23 by August 2024, considering “market dynamics, regulatory developments, and the outcome of Ripple’s legal case” with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).



Notably, it has also explained that Ripple’s strategic partnerships could positively affect the acceptance of XRP and, with it, the token’s price action:




“Ripple has established partnerships with numerous banks and financial institutions, indicating growing adoption and integration of XRP into mainstream financial systems.”

Currently, XRP is changing hands at $0.52919, suggesting a decline of 2.19% in the last 24 hours but still recording an increase of 4.24% across the previous seven days and yet accumulating a drop of 1.08% on its monthly chart, as per data on May 22.

Earlier, crypto analyst Maximus Prime observed that XRP recently encountered rejection at the symmetrical trendline, a critical resistance level, stressing that XRP will have to “fight its way back into it and hold above,” adding that the two-week chart presented a bearish outlook but that bulls were still trying.







At the same time, EGRAG Crypto highlighted that XRP was showing “inclining steps to the upside” – a bullish sign visible “even if you’re not a chart analyst” – and a “solid trajectory” with the next pivotal target at $0.75, projecting consolidation followed by a pump and “the grand finale” in an X post on May 21.

All things considered, AI and experts’ bullish XRP predictions might be correct, but doing one’s own research, weighing the risks, and keeping up with any relevant XRP news and Ripple news is critical before investing a significant amount of money in this token, as trends can change.

SEC's tough stance on crypto continues: Gary Gensler slams 'FIT 21' Act - AMBCrypto



Gary Gensler has opposed the “FIT 21” Act, citing regulatory gaps and risks to investors.
SEC’s crypto stance before the 2024 elections could majorly sway voter sentiment.

As former President Donald Trump starts accepting crypto donations for his 2024 presidential campaign, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) Chair Gary Gensler has voiced his opposition against the crypto market bill.
Gensler’s sudden move 
In a statement released on the 22nd of May, Chair Gary Gensler publicly voiced his opposition to the Financial Innovation and Technology for the 21st Century Act (“FIT 21” Act).
The FIT 21 Act is a U.S. legislation aimed at promoting the development of new financial instruments and technologies while establishing a framework for their regulation and oversight.
Gensler stated,
“Financial Innovation and Technology for the 21st Century Act (“FIT 21”) would create new regulatory gaps and undermine decades of precedent regarding the oversight of investment contracts, putting investors and capital markets at immeasurable risk.”
He further added,
“The bill allows issuers of crypto investment contracts to self-certify that their products are a ‘decentralized’ system and then be deemed a special class of ‘digital commodities’ and thus not subject to SEC oversight.”
Such a strong stance by the SEC Chair ahead of the 2024 presidential election has sent shockwaves throughout the crypto community.
Crypto enthusiasts unhappy 
Underlining the unprecedented involvement of the SEC in presidential politics, journalist Chris Brummer took to X (formerly Twitter) and noted,

Echoing a similar line of thought, Ripple’s CLO, Stuart Alderoty, said,
“Gensler overplayed his hand. He thought crypto was an easy target. He relished being the guy that everyone loved to hate.”
He further went on and opined,
“He thought he was above Congressional oversight. That’s all gone. He’s now a struggling political liability.”
In a separate earlier interview, SEC Chair Gary Gensler voiced his frustration over the “outsized ratio” of crypto-related inquiries compared to those about traditional finance.
“Crypto is a small piece of our overall markets. But, it’s an outsized piece of the scams and frauds and problems in the markets.”
Impact on the upcoming elections 
These developments might have a significant impact on President Joe Biden’s position in the upcoming election.
His administration’s cautious stance on cryptocurrency, as reflected in Chair Gensler’s regulatory approach, contrasts sharply with Donald Trump’s pro-crypto moves.
Hence, the difference in their approaches may sway voters, especially those supportive of cryptocurrencies.

Probe finds Effective Ventures charity acted ‘diligently’ after FTX collapse


A UK government inquiry into an FTX-backed charity that received $26.8 million in donations, has concluded that its trustees acted ‘quickly’ and ‘diligently’ protecting the charity’s funds in the wake of the crypto exchange’s high-profile collapse. 
In 2022, Effective Ventures Foundation (EV) filed a Serious Incident Report with the Charity Commission, informing it that FTX, one of the charity’s major funders, had filed for bankruptcy amid reports of criminal activity. It also informed the commission that the CEO of FTX Foundation and an unpaid advisor to the FTX Future Fund made up two of EV’s trustees.
The commission subsequently launched a probe to determine ‘the extent of any risk to the charity’s assets and the extent to which the trustees were complying with their legal duties’ and to investigate ‘the governance and administration of the charity by the trustees, including relationships between the charity’s trustees and its funders and the identification and management of conflicts of interest.’
The investigation, which concluded with the publication of the commission’s report, revealed that EV trustees effectively ‘ringfenced’ its FTX funding of £3.3 million and $300,000 by informing the National Crime Agency that its FTX donated funds may be criminal as to avoid any money laundering offenses. 
The UK and US arms of EV also agreed to pay FTX a total of $26.8 million in 2022. The charity recently also listed for sale Wytham Abbey, the manor house that it bought with a £17 million ($21.5 million) grant in 2021.
EV bought the 15th-century manor using a £17 million grant unrelated to FTX.

The report also found that the charity excluded the two FTX-linked trustees from any decisions and discussions relating to the FTX bankruptcy, labeling them ‘non-participating’ trustees. The inquiry noted that there was a ‘lack of clarity’ around whether the FTX-linked trustees were acting for the charity or on behalf of FTX Foundation at any given time.
It stressed, however, that there was “no evidence” to suggest any unmanaged conflicts of interest or that the FTX-linked trustees acted against EV’s interests. The two reportedly resigned during the inquiry. 
The inquiry concluded, “Trustees acted diligently and quickly in assessing the risk to the charity and installed measures to protect their assets and continued operations.” It added that despite “highlighted weaknesses within the charity and its governance the trustees sought to put these things right at the earliest opportunity.”

Trump Accepting Crypto Donations In The US Election


                                Donald Trump's Strategic Move In the US Election                                What’s The NewsAll the candidates are putting in maximum effort for their campaigns for the US presidential election to be held in November. Current president and Democratic Party candidate Joe Biden is using safety and work record as his main tools in his campaign to secure victory. Meanwhile, potential Republican candidate Donald Trump has made a bold move by announcing that he will accept cryptocurrency donations for his election campaign thereby changing the entire direction of the US election. According to information collected by CoinGabbar, a notice was issued yesterday stating that the Trump 2024 Campaign has launched a fundraising page using the Coinbase Commerce product, allowing eligible individuals to donate in crypto. The website features logos of cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, Ether, Dogecoin, Shiba Inu, XRP, USD Coin, Solana, and ZRX.  According to the information, Elon Musk is considering Shiba Inu and Dogecoin as the better investment option.It's worth noting that Donald Trump recently held a dinner for those who bought NFTs featuring his mugshot from the time he surrendered at the Georgia jail. During this event, he asked his supporters to donate to his campaign in cryptocurrency.The president's support is a big boost for the US crypto industry which has ramped up lobbying efforts and has spent millions on the upcoming 2024 elections. This has become a new focus area for Trump to continue bashing Biden. He also disagreed with the administration’s stance on the matter, pointing out that SEC Chair Gary Gensler has been aggressively antagonistic towards crypto companies for failing to register with the agency. “The Democrats are very much against it,” Trump stated.Cryptocurrency Becomes The Center Of Attraction Amid US ElectionCryptocurrency has become the center point of the US presidential election. The two parties have different views on cryptocurrency. Democratic Party candidate and current President Joe Biden has never shown support for cryptocurrency.  Actions and investigations by the SEC against crypto exchanges during his tenure indicate that he does not consider cryptocurrency favorable. On the other hand, potential Republican candidate Donald Trump has shown a positive attitude toward crypto since the beginning of his campaign. He has also deemed the SEC investigations into crypto exchanges as wrong. Trump aims to directly connect with the crypto community by accepting cryptocurrencies as donations for his campaign. For your information, about 50% of the young population in the US are crypto investors. Trump's target is to connect with this demographic directly. If the crypto community supports Trump in the presidential election, his victory could be assured. Meanwhile, Joe Biden's indifferent attitude towards crypto continues to widen the gap between him and the crypto community, which could be a significant disadvantage for him in the election.Also Read: First-Ever Standalone Crypto Legislation By The U.S.

Tether mints another $1 billion USDT this week; Is a market pump ahead?


    Tether, the world’s largest stablecoin issuer, has minted an additional 1 billion USDT tokens on the Ethereum (ETH) blockchain, fueling speculation about a potential market surge. 



This development coincides with the crypto community’s anticipation of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission’s (SEC) decision on a spot Ethereum exchange-traded funds (ETF), expected later this week.







Tether’s CEO, Paolo Ardoino, clarified on X (formerly Twitter) that this issuance was for “inventory replenishment” and was an “authorized but not issued transaction.”







This means the tokens will be used as inventory for future issuance requests and chain swaps, but are not yet in circulation. This move is viewed by market analysts as a strategic preparation for a potential market rally fueled by the expected approval of an ETH ETF.



Ivan Sherbakov, CEO of Cryptorobotics, speculated that  this influx of liquidity will be used to pump the market ahead of ETF news.







Historically, an increase in USDT supply has been linked with broader upward trends in the crypto market, leading to increased trading volumes and a more vibrant digital asset environment.



Tether’s market impact



As of May 22, Tether’s Transparency page shows $87.8 million worth of these USDT tokens on Ethereum. Tether’s market cap has grown significantly over the past year, exceeding $111 billion and accounting for roughly 70% of the stablecoin market. 



This growth has been driven by various factors, including the successful launch of spot Bitcoin ETFs in the U.S. and Tether’s diversification into areas like Bitcoin mining.



Concerns and considerations



Despite the positive market implications, some analysts have expressed concerns about Tether’s lack of transparency. Deutsche Bank analysts have highlighted potential risks associated with Tether’s significant market dominance.



With the total stablecoin market capitalization exceeding $160.9 billion, Tether holds a significant share. 



These transparency issues and market dominance continue to be debated among analysts and investors, even as Tether’s actions could trigger significant market movements if the ETF is approved.

Bitcoin key support and resistance levels to watch for a possible breakout


    Bitcoin (BTC) revisited the $70,000 price zone in a bullish seven days, powered by macroeconomic indicators and overall positive sentiments in the cryptocurrency market. Finbold looked for insights on key support and resistance levels to watch for in the last week of May.



Notably, Bitcoin has been trading in a well-defined range since March, from $60,000 to $72,000. During this time, BTC has made two brief deviations—of two days each—from the price range. One in mid-March made an all-time high at $73,805, and the other in early May flash-crashed to $56,590.



Therefore, the $60,000 and the $72,000 levels remain the most important support and resistance to watch for. A breakout, followed by confirmation with increased volume, from any of these levels would bring a more aggressive move.







In the meantime, the $70,000 price makes a relevant psychological resistance that Bitcoin is currently testing. Moreover, the 30-day exponential moving average (30-EMA) has also been a key level, now making support at $65,200/btc.

Bitcoin on-chain data for key support and resistance levels



Looking further, Finbold gathered on-chain data from IntoTheBlock on May 22, which highlights other key levels to watch for.



In particular, the “In/Out of the Money Around Price” metric shows strong support at lower prices than current ones. The largest volume is within the $63,728 to $65,830 level, at an average of $64,689. 1.79 million addresses purchased over 953,260 BTC at these prices and are currently in profit.



On the other hand, there is no relevant volume to the upside, suggesting weaker resistance to the range’s top for BTC at above $72,000.

Is Bitcoin ready for new all-time highs?



In this context, Finbold checked Bitcoin’s “Market Value To Realized Value” (MVRV) Ratio of the last 90 days on Santiment.



MVRV shows the ratio between the current price and the average price of every coin acquired. Essentially, higher ratios surge in potential resistance, foreshadowing increased selling activity, while the opposite is also valid to form support.



As of this writing, the 90-day MVRV ratio at 6% suggests a neutral outlook, with weak resistance at $70,000. Nevertheless, these prices have a proportionally low ratio compared to the 35% seen in March.



Hence, Bitcoin might make new all-time highs in the following days or weeks.

In conclusion, Bitcoin’s key support and resistance levels to watch are $60,000, $64,690, $70,000, and $72,000. The support levels are stronger than the resistance, which suggests a breakout to the upside. It is important, however, to understand that cryptocurrencies are highly volatile digital assets, and indicators are not conclusive.

OpenSea Reveals ‘Get Based’ Series on Ethereum L2 Base With Free NFT Drops - Decrypt

As Coinbase’s Ethereum layer-2 scaling network Base continues to gain steam, NFT marketplace OpenSea is gearing up to throw a spotlight on the network and its artists with the launch of “Get Based”—a series of free or low-cost digital artwork drops.Kicking off Thursday with a mint of a reimagining of the classic “Endless Summer” film artwork (seen in full below) by Carty Sewell—an artist and OpenSea employee, as well—the “Get Based” series is set to encompass works by as many as 15 artists over the summer.Weekly drops will take place via both OpenSea’s website and via frames on social media protocol Farcaster, with each open edition drop set to cost $5 or less—and some will be free.Additional confirmed artists/projects for “Get Based” include RGB Punks creator Jhekub, “Primitives” creator Hun, meme artist Cryptic Poet, Twitter “Fail Whale” creator Yiying Lu, illustrator Subwway, and Thank You Base God—which recently did a free Base NFT mint on OpenSea that yielded more than 181,000 total mints.The first drop in the "Get Based" series is from artist Carty Sewell. Image: OpenSeaBase has become a significant part of OpenSea’s focus in recent months as the marketplace embraces the budding NFT scene on a chain that doesn’t yet have entrenched, high-value collections—unlike on layer-1 chains like Ethereum mainnet or Solana.“Get Based” is planned as an introduction to emerging artists on Base, while also helping to introduce collectors to the chain. OpenSea offers native bridging of assets to Base, as well as the ability to purchase with fiat currency and credit cards via a MoonPay integration.“The Base ecosystem has proven to be a catalyst for new utility and creativity using NFTs,” OpenSea co-founder and CEO Devin Finzer told Decrypt. “We’ve been supportive of Base since its inception, and we’re excited to highlight up-and-coming artists with unique artistic styles and grow their presence within the larger NFT community.”The “Get Based” series will take place alongside Base’s upcoming “On-Chain Summer II” promotion, which kicks off on June 3 and will offer more than 600 ETH (nearly $2.3 million) worth of prizes, incentives, and gas credits across various projects and protocols.

Ethereum Rally Looms: Analyst Predicts ETH's Next Stop Is $5,300


																Titan of Crypto, a well-known cryptocurrency trader and expert, in a daring prediction that has drawn the attention of the crypto community, forecasting an impending significant rally for Ethereum (ETH) to unprecedented heights while putting his next price target for the crypto asset at the pivotal $5,300 level.
The analyst’s prognosis indicates that Ethereum, fueled by favorable market circumstances and rising investors’ confidence, is poised for massive gains. This forecast comes at the heel of ETH’s recent robust price performance and increasing market optimism.
Ethereum Path To Massive Rally
In February, Titan of Crypto hinted at the formation of a Bullish Cypher Pattern on Ethereum‘s weekly chart. “Just like for Bitcoin, a bullish cypher pattern is currently playing out on ETH weekly chart as well,” he stated.

Due to this, the expert pointed out several targets for the asset to reach in the near term, such as $2,410, $2,881, $3,353, and $4,024, indicating a 38.20%, 50.00%, 61.80%, 78.60% upswingm respectively, from the current price then.
Earlier this month, Titan of Crypto noted that the bullish cypher pattern has successfully developed, and the aforementioned price targets have all been achieved, suggesting a substantial rally is on the horizon.
Potential rally to $5,300 level | Source: Titan of Crypto on X
At that time, the crypto expert underscored that ETH was at the 38.2% Fibonacci retracement level, which he also dubbed the 1st stop ($2,880). Should the coin manage to sustain this level, Titan of Crypto anticipates a move on the upside from the level.
However, today, as predicted by the expert, Ethereum performed a flawless recovery from the 1st stop ($2,880) point. As a result, the crypto asset is currently forming a bull flag pattern on the weekly timeframe, citing $5,300 as the next price target for ETH to reach. 
However, this is not the final destination, suggesting the potential for Ethereum to surge even higher in the upcoming months. With ETH displaying strong price performance, it could mean that the Altcoin season could be coming into play in the near future.
Indicator That Suggests A Price Correction On The Downside
Although Titan of Crypto anticipates a massive rally for ETH, Ali Martinez has underlined the potential for the asset to decline soon.  According to Ali Martinez, the TD Sequential indicator on Ethereum’s 4-hour timeframe on May 15, previously displayed a promising buy signal. This development practically led to a 32% rise in the price of Ethereum.

	Related Reading



However, now that the ETH Spot Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs) are generating so much buzz, the indicator has transitioned to a sell signal. Consequently, Ali Martinez predicts a downward correction of one to four candlesticks.
At the time of writing, ETH had increased by over 28% in the past week, trading at around $3,728. Despite the recent price momentum, the asset’s market cap and trading volume are down by 1.56% and 28%, respectively.

Ripple Unveils Ticker For New Stablecoin In Trademark Filing


								Ripple Labs Inc. has filed a trademark application that suggests “RLUSD” as the ticker for its upcoming dollar-based stablecoin. This development comes amid growing anticipation within the XRP community regarding the company’s new financial product, which aims to integrate seamlessly with On-Demand Liquidity (ODL), recently rebranded as Ripple Payments.
Details On Ripple’s RLUSD Trademark Filing
According to details from Justia Trademarks, the filing, identified under serial number 98537677, was made on May 7, 2024. This application is still in the early stages of processing, listed under the status “630 – New Application – Record Initialized Not Assigned To Examiner.” The attorney of record for this filing is Olivia Maria Baratta from Kilpatrick Townsend & Stockton LLP.

The filing specifies a broad range of financial services tied to this trademark, which include but are not limited to “monetary services for receiving and disbursing payments and gifts in virtual and digital currency and digital tokens of value determined by fiat currency over a computer network.” Moreover, the application covers “financial management and administration services, such as facilitating transfers of digital currency and electronic transmission of digital currency.”
This move by Ripple marks a significant step towards launching its stablecoin, which had been hinted at earlier this year. In April 2024, the company had expressed its intentions to delve into the stablecoin market, a strategic pivot aiming to harness a market sector that is projected to burgeon to a near $3 trillion valuation in the upcoming years.

The choice of RLUSD as a ticker symbol appears to be a tactical decision, influenced by the preoccupation of other potential tickers such as USDX and USDR by other entities. Flare Networks has already introduced USDX as a stablecoin on its blockchain platform, while USDR is currently utilized by Real USD. These circumstances presumably led Ripple to settle on the designation of RLUSD for its stablecoin initiative.
While the formal launch and full details of the stablecoin are still forthcoming, the trademark filing marks another major step for Ripple’s broad vision for a full-service crypto company. The company has yet to issue an official statement regarding the detailed features and launch timeline for RLUSD.
As previously revealed, the primary motivation for introducing a stablecoin and integrating it with its payment platform is to enhance its Ripple Payments solution for cross-border transactions. The stablecoin will enable US based customers to leverage stablecoin for international payments through Ripple Payments, as an alternative to using XRP.
“I see stablecoins as a complement or even an accelerant to what Ripple’s doing at its core,” Garlinghouse remarked during a recent interview with the CEO of SCB 10X.
At press time, XRP traded at 0.53379.

                        United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) Chair Gary Gensler released a statement Wednesday morning criticizing the Financial Innovation and Technology for the 21st Century Act (FIT21) ahead of the crypto regulation’s expected vote in the House today.SEC Chair Gary Gensler Pushes Back On FIT21 Before House Vote
In a blog post published on the SEC’s website Wednesday, Gensler claimed the bill would in part “create new regulatory gaps and undermine decades of precedent regarding the oversight of investment contracts,” ultimately “putting investors and capital markets at immeasurable risk.”In particular, the federal regulator argued that FIT21 would work against already established securities law by negating the long-accepted Howey Test while reneging current regulations on investment contracts, allowing crypto operators to “self-certify” their products.“The crypto industry’s record of failures, frauds, and bankruptcies is not because we don’t have rules or because the rules are unclear. It’s because many players in the crypto industry don’t play by the rules,” Gensler continued.“We should make the policy choice to protect the investing public over facilitating business models of non-compliant firms.”Crypto Regulations Finally See Traction On Capitol Hill
Gensler’s commentary comes amidst a wave of momentum for crypto regulation on Capitol Hill, signaling potential pushback from U.S. lawmakers over the SEC’s current regulatory regimen towards digital assets.Earlier this month, both chambers of Congress voted on a resolution that would effectively overturn the SEC’s controversial crypto accounting guidance known as SAB121.In a statement shortly following the vote disavowing SAB121, pro-crypto Senator Cynthia Lummis (R-WY) claimed it was “a win for financial innovation and a clear rebuke of the way the Biden admin and Gary Gensler have persecuted crypto.”Gensler has long ruffled the feathers of key players in the crypto space, with the federal agency doling a swath of litigation to digital asset organizations for allegedly breaking U.S. securities law.Meanwhile, Ripple’s Chief Legal Officer Stuart Alderoty, the blockchain firm currently locked in a contentious legal battle with the SEC over the sale of cryptocurrency XRP, took to X early on Wednesday to criticize Gensler’s leadership of the SEC.“Gensler overplayed his hand. He thought crypto was an easy target,” Alderoty wrote. “He relished being the guy that everyone loved to hate. He thought he was above Congressional oversight. That’s all gone. He’s now a struggling political liability.”Should U.S. lawmakers advance FIT21, it would mark the U.S. government’s first successful push for a crypto regulatory framework and a strong reprimand of Gensler’s treatment of digital assets.

If SEC approves ether ETF, will it approve altcoin ETFs?


With the likelihood of the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) approving a spot ether ETF suddenly rising, altcoin investors are speculating on a possible flurry of approvals for additional coins. 
Indeed, just this morning, WisdomTree gained approval from the UK Financial Conduct Authority to list its 100% physically backed Ethereum ETP on the London Stock Exchange as early as May 28 — although the products will not be available for retail investment.
The bullish momentum for ether, which is up 29% this week alone, might spill over into other crypto assets.
On Monday, Bloomberg ETF analysts James Seyffart and Eric Balchunas declared that the likelihood of the SEC approving a spot ether ETF had jumped from 25% to 75% thanks to the agency’s reported commentary to at least one exchange and one ETF applicant regarding their 19b-4 exchange rule change request.
The Wall Street Journal confirmed the news while CoinDesk also cited three people familiar with the matter. Around the same time and without citing 19b-4 news, David Han at Coinbase Institutional wrote a note adjusting his outlook for a spot ether ETF upward.
Barrons claimed staff workers at the SEC told exchanges “that it is leaning toward approving them, according to people familiar with the matter.”
As early as tomorrow, the SEC could approve a so-called 19b-4 filing that, alongside a related S-1 filing the deadline of which is weeks away, might lead to an eventual listing of a spot ether ETF by investment manager VanEck.
Other ETF sponsors have also filed 19b-4 applications with the SEC for a spot ether ETF, including Fidelity, 21Shares, Invesco/Galaxy, and Franklin Templeton. VanEck requested the earliest response date: tomorrow.

Will a spot ether ETF lead to other altcoin ETFs?
Certainly, ether is just one of many altcoins trading on US stock exchanges via trusts. There are over a dozen trusts publicly trading in the US holding alternate crypto assets: Litecoin (LTC), Chainlink (LINK), Basic Attention Token (BAT), Bitcoin Cash (BCH), Decentraland (MANA), Ethereum Classic (ETC), Filecoin (FIL), Polkadot (DOT), Horizon (ZEN), Stellar Lumens (XLM), Livepeer (LPT), Zcash (ZEC), and Solana (SOL).
So, if the SEC approves a spot ether ETF, could it also approve ETFs for additional altcoins?
The logic of altcoin proponents — arguing that non-ether spot altcoin ETFs might gain SEC approval shortly after a spot ether ETF — usually follows a simple argument: If the SEC permitted Grayscale to convert its bitcoin trust into an ETF, why would commissioners deny trust sponsors of other crypto assets to convert into an ETF?
For obvious reasons, that argument might fail if the SEC claims the crypto asset is an unregistered security. However, the SEC hasn’t classified all crypto assets held in US public trusts as securities.
Interestingly, many crypto trusts trading on OTC Markets, a US stock exchange, hold expressly SEC-designated unregistered securities, including SOL, MANA, and FIL. More crypto assets are rumored to be SEC-designated unregistered securities: ZEN, XLM, and ZEN. 
Nevertheless, there are certain trusts trading on US OTC Markets that don’t hold SEC-designated unregistered securities, such as DOT or ETC trusts. Perhaps, if the SEC were to approve a spot ether ETF, commissioners might approve spot ETFs based on such possibly non-security crypto assets.
It’s worth noting that just because the SEC hasn’t classified a crypto asset as an unregistered security doesn’t mean that it’s not. Congress didn’t task the SEC to proactively classify all assets. Instead, the SEC simply chooses to accept or reject applications that it receives, or file enforcement actions against illegal conduct on a case-by-case basis, as it has the time, money, staff, and resources.
Silence from commissioners doesn’t indicate non-designation.
Of course, there is a counterargument against this logic. Unlike altcoins like DOT or ETC, only bitcoin and ether have futures contracts listed on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME). This CME market of significant size for ether alone might be a carrying reason for approving only a spot ether ETF and not any other altcoin.
Spot ether ETF: No longer an obvious SEC rejection?
According to reports from Bloomberg, Barron’s, and Wall Street Journal sources, the Trading and Markets Division at the SEC has requested amendments to an exchange and sponsor’s joint 19b-4 form — likely VanEck. This is a bullish sign for a possible spot ether ETF approval because, in the view of market observers, the SEC is typically silent or disinterested in 19b-4 filings if it intends to reject them.
Because the SEC is asking for a reapplication, the reasoning goes, its interest is likely a positive development.

Many viewed the SEC’s stance toward a spot ether ETF as decidedly negative. Joe Lubin’s ConsenSys even sued the SEC claiming that commissioners had secretly categorized ether as an unregistered security.
Therefore, if the SEC is actually considering a possible approval of a spot ETF for Ethereum, it would be a marked change of tone.

Amid all of these media reports, the price of ether has rallied by 29% over the past seven days — outperforming bitcoin’s 12% rally by an additional 17%.
Form 19b-4 asks applicants for the information necessary for the public to understand why the SEC should change its Section 19(b)(1) rules pursuant to the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. In this case, the exchange and an ETF sponsor must explain why the SEC should allow ether to be used as the sole asset of a spot ETF.

UK Approves First Cryptocurrency Exchange-Traded Products | Cryptoglobe


                                
According to Bloomberg, the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA), the UK’s financial regulator, has approved the first cryptocurrency exchange-traded products (ETPs), marking a milestone in the UK’s approach to digital asset investment.



An ETP is a type of security traded on stock exchanges, similar to individual stocks. ETPs are designed to track the performance of a specific index, commodity, currency, or other benchmark, allowing investors to gain exposure to various asset classes without directly owning the underlying assets. ETPs can include different structures, such as exchange-traded funds (ETFs), exchange-traded notes (ETNs), and exchange-traded commodities (ETCs).



An ETF is a specific type of ETP that pools together various assets, such as stocks, bonds, or commodities, into a single fund. ETFs aim to replicate the performance of a specific index or benchmark and are structured as investment funds. When you invest in an ETF, you own shares of the fund, which, in turn, owns the underlying assets. ETFs are typically regulated under investment company laws, which provide certain protections and requirements for investors. Additionally, ETFs can distribute dividends to investors if the underlying assets generate income.



The main difference between ETPs and ETFs lies in their structure and scope. ETPs is a broad category that includes various types of exchange-traded securities, not limited to funds. They can encompass notes and commodities as well. While ETFs are a subset of ETPs and are specifically structured as investment funds, other types of ETPs, like ETNs, are debt instruments issued by banks. ETFs are regulated under specific investment fund regulations, while other types of ETPs, such as ETNs, may have different regulatory frameworks. Moreover, ETNs carry the credit risk of the issuer as they are debt securities, whereas ETFs do not have this risk since they own the underlying assets directly. Another distinction is that ETFs can distribute dividends to investors, whereas ETNs do not because they do not directly own the underlying assets.



Per Bloomberg’s article, WisdomTree Inc. announced today that it has received FCA approval to list two physically-backed crypto ETPs, which will track Bitcoin and Ether, on the London Stock Exchange. These products are expected to begin trading as early as 28 May 2024. 







            
            

            
            

            
            

        

Several other issuers, including ETC Group, 21Shares, and CoinShares, have also applied to list their crypto products in the UK. As of midday on Wednesday, the FCA’s approval list included entries from WisdomTree, 21Shares, and Invesco Digital Markets Plc, all set to be part of the first batch of trading on the approval date.



Despite this advancement, the FCA has implemented stringent rules surrounding these products. WisdomTree’s Bitcoin and Ether ETPs, although physically-backed, are only available to professional investors. This restriction is stricter compared to the United States, where the approval of spot Bitcoin ETFs in January has led to significant market growth. Bloomberg says that in the US, these ETFs now manage a combined $59 billion, which is nearly five times the total for similar crypto vehicles traded in Europe.



ETPs linked to cryptocurrencies have been trading on other European stock exchanges for years. The approval of such products by the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) earlier this year played a crucial role in propelling Bitcoin to a record high in March and has facilitated broader adoption among retail and institutional investors.











However, not all global markets have seen the same enthusiasm. In Hong Kong, despite the approval of Bitcoin and Ether ETFs, investor response has been lukewarm. This contrast highlights the varying degrees of market maturity and investor interest in different regions.



ETC Group confirmed that its application is still under review, while 21Shares has already secured approval. CoinShares and the FCA declined to comment on their status, and Invesco had no immediate response.

Shiba Inu (SHIB) Loses Market Spot to Avalanche (AVAX): Details

In a reshuffling move, dog-themed cryptocurrency Shiba Inu (SHIB) has lost its market spot to Avalanche (AVAX).Shiba Inu has remained in 11th place in the market rankings after falling out of the top 10 due to profit-taking following its stunning 300% increase in late February to early March. Despite the profit-taking that followed, Shiba Inu fiercely defended its rankings, remaining in 11th place throughout.However, Shiba Inu's resolve has been tested with Avalanche overtaking it, pushing it to 12th place in the crypto market rankings. Shiba Inu's drop in the rankings coincides with a larger market fall that has seen SHIB lose roughly 4% of its value in the last 24 hours. This fall follows profit-taking after the SHIB price reached a high of $0.00002684 during today's trading session. Market Rankings, Courtesy: CoinMarketCapEarlier in the week, crypto prices rose on hints of progress toward U.S. approval of exchange-traded funds investing directly in Ethereum as optimism revived.SHIB's price climbed alongside the market, but to a smaller extent. SHIB is currently up 5.15% over the last seven days, as its gains were relatively muted by the stiff daily MA 50 barrier near $0.000025. In recent weeks, specifically since mid-April, Shiba Inu's price has been constricted by the daily SMA 50 barrier. Shiba Inu consistently faced a battle surpassing this level; however, the bulls made a successful attempt on May 20 before confronting resistance. Conversely, Avalanche experienced a surge in value, climbing over 18% in the past week. This growth has propelled AVAX to overtake SHIB, with a current market capitalization of $15.6 billion compared to Shiba Inu's $14.8 billion, according to CoinMarketCap data.As the market scenario unfolds, eyes will be on Shiba Inu to see if it can sustain its rise above the tough daily MA 50 barrier. Whether SHIB can reclaim its position or AVAX will continue to climb the ranks remains to be seen.

SEC Chair Gary Gensler criticizes crypto market bill before House vote

Hours before the U.S. House of Representatives is set to vote on a crypto bill, president Biden released a statement saying that he is against the legislation, but he isn’t threatening to veto it.Why Bitcoin and Ether are skyrocketingThe White House expressed opposition to the bill, ‘The Financial Innovation and Technology for the 21st Century Act (FIT21),’ on Wednesday afternoon, due to concerns over inadequate investor protections.The bill, ‘The Financial Innovation and Technology for the 21st Century Act (FIT21), would effectively classify cryptocurrency as a commodity, not a security, and therefore make it exempt from securities regulations.“The Administration is eager to work with Congress to ensure a comprehensive and balanced regulatory framework for digital assets, building on existing authorities, which will promote the responsible development of digital assets and payment innovation and help reinforce United States leadership in the global financial system,” the White House statement said. “H.R. 4763 in its current form lacks sufficient protections for consumers and investors who engage in certain digital asset transactions.”The statement comes a few hours after the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission Chair Gary Gensler publicly expressed his opposition to the bill. Gensler stated, “FIT21 would create new regulatory gaps and undermine decades of precedent regarding the oversight of investment contracts, putting investors and capital markets at immeasurable risk.” He reiterated his stance on cryptocurrency as securities, expressing concern that the bill would exclude blockchain-recorded investment contracts from the statutory definition of securities and, hence, the protections of the federal securities laws.“Further, by removing this set of investment contracts from the statutory list of securities, the bill implies what courts have repeatedly ruled — but what crypto market participants have attempted to deny — that many crypto assets are being offered and sold as securities under existing law,” the chair added.The bill would allow companies to self-certify that they are issuing digital commodities and also give the SEC 60 days to determine if those assets fit the bill’s definition of digital commodities.“There are more than 16,000 crypto assets that currently exist. Given limits on staff resources, and no new resources provided by the bill, it is implausible that the SEC could review and challenge more than a fraction of those assets,” he said.FIT21 was introduced last summer to determine whether a cryptocurrency should be classified as a commodity or a security and assign oversight accordingly between the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) and the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).Per Forbes, the Republican candidate and former U.S. President Donald Trump and his advisors also support the crypto market structure bill. Trump, who used to criticize crypto as a scam against the U.S. dollar, is now promoting himself as crypto’s candidate. Yesterday, he announced that he would start accepting campaign donations in crypto.The crypto industry has been eagerly awaiting regulatory actions from the U.S. authorities and advocating for changes in laws to prevent crypto from being categorized as a security. The SEC Chair, however, has referred to crypto as a security from time to time and claims it falls under his jurisdiction. Gensler, who once taught a course on blockchain and cryptocurrencies at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, is known for his strict approach to regulating crypto. He’s called the cryptocurrency market a Wild West, emphasizing its need for regulation.

Why I’m a single-issue crypto voter - Blockworks


Given the events of the past two years, everyone in the United States in both parties should be single-issue voters in favor of crypto having a level playing field. In particular, we should support all politicians who oppose the Biden administration’s extreme efforts to kill the industry in the United States, regardless of party, Republican or Democrat. 
This stance is not about being pro-crypto, it is about being pro-fairness. Today, the actions of the executive branch target the crypto industry, but who will be the next target under future administrations? Fossil fuel producers? Abortion providers? Public sector unions? Gun manufacturers? Green energy companies? The press?
As a people, we cannot allow government misbehavior of this sort, and it must be our primary source of concern. If we cannot secure fair treatment under the law for all, every other right we enjoy as Americans is threatened.
Why do I believe this?
In the beginning of US regulatory engagement, we had a few strict crypto regulators like the New York Department of Financial Services with its BitLicense regime. Even so, those regulators intended for crypto did exist, just within the rules. 
In 2022, however, we began to see regulators take it upon themselves to judge that an industry should not exist and begin to take any and all actions to destroy it. As a result, we have seen a staggering variety of inappropriate and, in some cases, illegal actions from federal agencies against crypto.
The SEC has been sanctioned by a federal judge in Utah for lying in court, bankrupting a business and destroying lives to get a TRO in the Debt Box case. The SEC treated the BTC ETF application process so inappropriately that it was ultimately overruled by a different federal judge who called its behavior “arbitrary and capricious.” The SEC promulgated a rule on crypto custody called SAB 121 without consulting the industry or other regulators, which is so mechanically broken it has essentially banned regulated financial entities from offering crypto custody and caused both houses of Congress to vote in bipartisan fashion to overrule it. 
Additionally, the SEC somehow managed to sue Ripple, Coinbase, Kraken and Uniswap Labs while failing completely to sue either FTX, Terraform Labs, Celsius, 3AC or BlockFi before their various collapses harmed countless investors and consumers.
Banking regulators have engaged in similarly inappropriate behavior. From issuing a joint letter in February 2023 that unilaterally called tokens on public blockchains “highly likely to be inconsistent with safe and sound banking practices” to pressuring banks to de-platform their crypto customers without evidence of legal wrongdoing or undue risk through “Operation Chokepoint 2.0,” they have also overreached. The Federal Reserve continues to deny Custodia, a regulated bank in Wyoming, an account.
Across the board, our federal government’s approach to crypto reeks of bias and misconduct. If we cannot trust the federal government to play fair, then all other political positions fade in importance until the checks and balances of the system are restored. In this case, it is important to remember that the ultimate check on both the executive and the legislative branches is the people. 
My belief is that crypto deserves fair treatment. While Republicans have been the recent champions of the industry thanks to their pro-business views, forward-thinking Democrat Ritchie Torres wrote an op-ed in 2022 titled “The Liberal Case for Cryptocurrency.” Long after Trump is gone from crypto, Torres and other Democrats will remain. More than 30 Democrats between the House and Senate broke ranks with the administration to vote down SAB 121. 
Fair treatment under the law is a stance all Americans of all parties can rally behind. As a long-time Democrat myself, I believe this stance will stand the test of time for both parties. Even politicians who do not care about or even dislike crypto should be able to support the basic point that obeying the law and having fair rules is essential. If they can’t, we should vote them out.
I believe we should vote for any politician, Democrat or Republican, who rejects things like the SEC’s illegal antics in the Debt Box case or the gross misconduct of the head of the FDIC. We must secure the basic fairness of our system and hold accountable those who flagrantly violate it.
That is why I am a single issue voter on this topic. It is not that I am pro-crypto, it is that I am pro-fairness.

‘Euphoric Bull’ Phase Could Be Approaching for Bitcoin (BTC), According to On-Chain Analyst - The Daily Hodl


								Bitcoin (BTC) could be approaching a “euphoric bull” phase, according to a popular on-chain analyst.
The pseudonymous analyst known as Checkmate tells his 91,100 followers on the social media platform X that BTC is approaching a “decision point.”










“Bitcoin breaking to a new ATH (all-time high) has historically represented a transition point from the Enthusiastic Bull, into the Euphoric Bull.
It also coincides with the MVRV (market value to realized value) ratio getting above 1 standard deviation, but we rarely clear it on the first attempt.”
Source: Checkmate/X
MVRV is the ratio of Bitcoin’s market capitalization relative to its realized capitalization (the value of all BTC at the price they were bought). It is used to assess whether the crypto asset is undervalued or overvalued.
Checkmate acknowledges that he doesn’t know when that transition point will occur.
“I don’t have a view on that as we cannot know. It completely depends on capital inflows, which right now look pretty healthy. Therefore, it could be that now is the time… but we will have to read the tape as it happens. Predictions are not overly useful, instead, I prepare my reaction function. It isn’t about what will happen –> it is about what you will do when it happens.”
The analyst also says the ongoing Bitcoin bull market is “much, much more structured” than the 2021 bull run.
“It looks a lot more like 2016/17. Spot-driven, resilient. It’s just fantastic. I love what I’m seeing in this price action.”
BTC is trading at $69,815 at time of writing. The top-ranked crypto asset by market cap is up nearly 2% in the past 24 hours and nearly 14% in the past seven days.

SEC Chair Gensler opposes today's FIT21 vote yet White House calls no 'veto'

Gary Gensler, Chairman of the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), issued a statement on May 22 expressing strong opposition to the Financial Innovation and Technology for the 21st Century (FIT21) Act.The FIT21 Act is widely celebrated for offering regulatory clarity to the crypto industry. However, Gensler has criticized it, arguing that the bill would weaken current consumer protections in the crypto market.The President Biden administration said it opposes the bill’s passage. However, the White House clarified that it was willing to work with the US Congress to “ensure a comprehensive and balanced regulatory framework for digital assets, building on existing authorities.”Notably, the US House of Representatives is scheduled to vote on the bill later today, May 22.Gensler’s dissentGensler warned that the proposed bill would create significant regulatory gaps, undermining decades of precedent in overseeing investment contracts and putting investors and capital markets at substantial risk.The SEC chair further highlighted that the regulation would prevent blockchain-based investment contracts from being classified as securities. This change would enable crypto investment contract issuers to self-certify their products as decentralized, effectively removing them from SEC oversight. He added:“The SEC would only have 60 days to review and challenge the certification that a product is a digital commodity. Those that the SEC successfully challenges would be re-classified as restricted digital assets and subject to the bill’s lighter-touch SEC oversight regime that excludes many core protections. “Moreover, Gensler criticized the bill for abandoning the Howey Test, a key method for determining if an investment qualifies as a security. He argued that this would lead to reduced protections for the few investment contracts that are considered securities. Additionally, he pointed out the risks posed by excluding crypto asset trading platforms from being classified as exchanges.Gensler emphasized that the bill poses a significant threat to the American capital market and its investors. He stated that the legislation would undermine capital markets by allowing firms to evade enforcement actions more easily.FIT21 enjoys supportDespite Gensler’s antagonism towards the bill, the proposed legislation enjoys strong support from the US Congress and the crypto community.In a May 21 statement, Congressman French Hill, the Chairman of the Subcommittee on Digital Assets, Financial Technology, and Inclusion, said the bill gives the SEC authority over digital assets that are not certified under the legislation and would provide adequate securities to protect against another FTX-like situation.Several crypto companies, including Coinbase, Circle, Kraken, Gemini, and advocacy group Stand With Crypto, have urged US lawmakers to support the legislation. The Crypto Council for Innovation (CCI) stated:“FIT 21 will introduce new compliance challenges for digital assets companies, but regulatory clarity is indisputably more responsible, safer for consumers, and preferable to the status quo.”As the bill awaits today’s vote, the White House has confirmed that it will not attempt to veto it if it passes, even though it does “oppose” the bill. The vote will likely now be one of the most important pieces of crypto legislation to be voted on by Congress.Mentioned in this articleLatest Alpha Market Report

                        The landscape of crypto taxes is varied and dynamic, with some nations emerging as particularly friendly to crypto investors and traders.Countries with low taxation on cryptocurrencies reap the benefits of increased investment, innovation, and economic growth, creating a compelling argument for the adoption of similar policies worldwide.Contrasting these havens are countries with more stringent crypto tax laws, which can stifle local market growth and push investors to seek more favorable environments.High-tax countries often see a brain drain in talent and capital, which can be detrimental in the long run.Evaluating Crypto Taxes
For crypto investors and businesses, understanding the landscape of crypto taxation is pivotal.When assessing where to invest or operate in the crypto space, several key factors come into play.First and foremost is the tax rate itself, which directly impacts the return on investment.Some countries offer zero tax on long-term capital gains, which can significantly enhance profitability.Additionally, exemptions such as threshold limits for taxable income or gains can also be a deciding factor for small traders and casual investors.However, the regulatory environment is equally critical. Clarity and stability in regulations ensure that investors understand the rules and can comply without fearing sudden changes.Moreover, the degree of crypto adoption within a country often signals how supportive its environment is towards innovation and technology-driven financial services.Here is a list of countries with best tax policies related to digital assets:1. GermanyGermany stands out in Europe as a beacon for crypto investors. If you hold your crypto investments for more than a year, you are exempt from taxes on any gains, fostering a culture of long-term investment.Smaller gains under €600 are also tax-free, which encourages casual investors to participate without the burden of taxation.Even for the sale of Bitcoin within one year, capital gains tax will only be applied if the amount is more than 600 euros.2. PortugalMoving southwest, Portugal offers a favorable tax environment where crypto earnings are free of personal income tax.This exemption extends to trading cryptocurrencies, making it an attractive hub for day traders and crypto companies alike.However, it is worth noting that in 2023, the country started applying a 28% tax on short-term crypto gains from selling crypto held for less than a year.In February 2024, the country passed a bill that obliges crypto holders to declare their crypto assets in an annual IRS tax declaration3. SingaporeIn Asia, Singapore has positioned itself as a fintech hub by not imposing any capital gains tax on crypto investments.Moreover, digital payment tokens are exempt from Goods and Services Tax (GST) in Singapore.The absence of specific taxes on crypto transactions further cements its status as a forward-thinking center for financial innovation.4. MaltaMalta, known as the “Blockchain Island,” treats crypto transactions similarly to day trading but offers benefits for long-term holdings.Its legal framework is tailored to the nuances of blockchain technology and cryptocurrency, providing a solid foundation for businesses and investors.In Malta, there is no long-term capital gains tax for cryptocurrency. However, trading cryptocurrency may be considered income taxed at a maximum of 35%.5. SwitzerlandLastly, Switzerland is renowned not just for its chocolates but also for its crypto-friendly policies.Although crypto wealth and income are subject to wealth tax, the rates are low, and professional trading can be tax-exempt, making it a hotspot for crypto finance.Comparative Analysis

Legendary Peter Brandt Predicted Ethereum (ETH) Rally: What's Next?

The legend of trading outside of the cryptocurrency industry, Peter Brandt, revealed that he has been building a bullish case for Ethereum since May 17 and even included an action plan for buying. Unfortunately, he did not reveal what is going to happen with ETH in the future, nor did he provide additional details on his buying plan. That is why we will have to address the price chart we have right now.Obviously, Ethereum is ripping and tearing the market right now, with the price of the second-biggest cryptocurrency slicing through the $3,600 resistance like a knife through butter. One way or another, there is no base below the price, so keep in mind that any correction could turn into a substantial one.ETH/USD Chart by TradingViewWith the breakthrough above $3,600, we should be ready for a stronger move up at around the 50-200 EMAs. But as we mentioned above, do not fall for the rapid price increase as prices after that are really unstable. Also, keep in mind that even Brandt's plan could include a bearish scenario in which Ether reverses around $4,000.However, with such rapid gains, the risk of a correction is always present. Ethereum's current price surge lacks a solid support base, meaning that any pullback could potentially lead to a significant drop. Traders should be cautious and consider setting stop-loss orders to protect their investments.By using RSI, we can determine whether or not Ethereum is entering the overbought zone. Unfortunately, for now, the indicator shows that Ether is on the verge of becoming overbought and potentially facing a reversal in the foreseeable future. Thus, if you are going long, make sure to avoid overleveraging existing positions. In general, Brandt's bullishness on Ethereum around May 17 made some sense, considering ETH reaching the local support level of the 200 EMA, which acted as a springboard for it.

PEPE Up 16% On The Week: It Won't 'Flip DOGE' But 'Should Go Up More Relatively,' Trader Points Out - Benzinga

Pseudonymous crypto trader Altcoin Sherpa shared his optimistic outlook on Pepe PEPE/USD, highlighting its strong volume and good liquidity as key factors for potential price upside.What Happened: Sherpa's Wednesday tweet points out the attractive qualities of PEPE for traders looking to invest in big-cap meme coins. He adds, "Good liquidity, strong volume, this one definitely catches up to the others." Although he does not believe PEPE will surpass more established meme coins like Dogecoin DOGE/USD, he anticipates it will see relative gains, noting that it "should go up more relatively."Another Pepe-focused trader, Plazma, highlighted that Pepe is doing four times more volume than Shiba Inu SHIB/USD and twice that of Dogecoin. Pepe's total volume across all centralized and decentralized exchanges stands at $4.5 billion.Price Action: In the past 24 hours, PEPE is trading 1% higher at $0.00001279, taking its monthly gains to 100%.Also Read: PEPE Hits All-Time High On 35% Daily Explosion: ‘Gearing Up For A 2021 DOGE Pump,’ Trader WritesWhy It Matters: Altcoin Sherpa’s mention of "long in the green boxes" suggests he has specific price levels in mind where he believes PEPE presents a good buy opportunity. This targeted approach helps traders understand where the coin might find support and rally, offering a clearer trading strategy.Sherpa’s crucial factors – robust trading volume and liquidity – are essential as they enable smoother buying and selling processes, reducing the impact of large trades on the coin’s price.

                        The price of DogWifMAGA Coin has fallen by 73% in the past 24 hours, with the new meme token correcting heavily after a big launch at the start of the week.Running on Solana, WIFMAGA had risen by as much as 50,000% in the day that followed its listing on Raydium, with the token trending on social media.Yet it has plunged significantly today, with the coin’s founders likely dumping their bags on the retail investors who’d jumped on its bandwagon.It may struggle to recover in any meaningful way, yet there are better alternatives available to traders seeking above-average gains, with multi-chain token Dogeverse one of the most promising new coins in the market right now.DogWifMAGA Coin Price Skyrockets as Presidential Elections Heat Up
There are two key features of DogWIFMAGA Coin’s chart, and both involve sharp declines.Firstly, the token’s price has declined consistently ever since reaching a high on Tuesday, and at the moment it doesn’t look like it’s going to recover.Source: DEXTools/TradingViewOne reason for this pessimism is that, secondly, the coin’s volume has also dried up, suggesting a very quick loss of interest.At the moment, its 24-hour volume stands only at $4 million, in contrast to $27 billion for Ethereum, for example, and $800 million for BONK (to take another Solana-based meme coin).As such, it would be unwise to assume that it’s going to recover anytime soon.This is particularly the case when its presence and fundamentals are minimal, even if some traders have been bigging it up in the past day.The coin’s only hope is that it attracts listings from major centralized exchanges, although its listing on Poloniex today has done little to resuscitate its price so far.It’s therefore uncertain as to whether we’ll see DogWifMAGA Coin recover, unless a wave of new listings boosts it.It has launched at a time when the United States is gearing up for yet another election between President Joe Biden and former President Donald Trump, with whom the coin is unofficially associating itself.Yet because it lacks any real credentials or fundamentals, it would be irresponsible to suggest that a comeback is certain.Buy Now or Is This Other Coin the Real Winner?
DogWifMAGA Coin may be inherently risky, yet there are some new meme tokens that actually show more potential for gains in the near future.Possibly the likeliest to make gains soon is Dogeverse (DOGEVERSE), a multi-chain crypto that has raised more than $15 million in its heavily subscribed presale.Source: DogeverseWhat’s special about Dogeverse is that it’s the market’s first Doge-themed multi-chain cryptocurrency, running on Ethereum, Polygon, BNB Chain, Solana, Avalanche and Base.Its availability on multiple chains means it could gain traction on many more apps and trading platforms than it would have otherwise.And by attracting more usage, it will, in theory, see its price rise over time.This will find help from the fact that it has a capped supply of 120 million tokens, meaning that it’s a deflationary cryptocurrency (unlike most other meme coins).On top of this, holders will be able to stake to token, something which could see a big proportion of its total supply exit circulation.Such tokenomics help explain why so many investors have ploughed into its sale, which newcomers can still join by going to the official Dogeverse website.1 DOGEVERSE is selling at a final sale price of $0.00031, although it’s likely to exceed this level comfortably once it lists in the next few weeks.Buy DOGEVERSE Today

Nexo Fee Fury: Users Slam Crypto Exchange After Surprise Hike


								The cryptocurrency exchange landscape is a battlefield of trust. With centralized platforms still reeling from high-profile scandals like FTX and Celsius, any misstep can send user loyalty plummeting. Nexo, a platform that had recently emerged relatively unscathed, now finds itself in hot water after a surprise fee increase sparked outrage amongst its customer base.

From Hero To Zero: Trust Eroded By Unannounced Fees
Nexo had managed to carve out a niche as a customer-centric exchange. Their ability to dodge legal troubles and a swift reversal of a disliked fee policy in April had painted a picture of a platform that listened. However, this carefully crafted image shattered on May 21st when users woke up to emails announcing a significant hike in bank transfer fees.
The new structure imposed a £5/€5 charge for FPS/SEPA withdrawals and a hefty $25/£25 fee for SWIFT transactions. This abrupt change ignited a firestorm on social media platforms like Reddit, with users expressing a mix of betrayal and frustration.

“They practically sent out the email after or at the exact moment they implemented it,” commented one disgruntled user, echoing a common sentiment. Many worried that this was just the tip of the iceberg, fearing a slippery slope of additional charges down the line.
The backlash extended beyond mere grumbling. One user on X, a popular social media platform, took a direct jab at Nexo’s aspirations, stating, “You won’t replace banks if you’re worse than them.” This highlights the core issue – Nexo’s attempt to position itself as a disruptive force in finance now appears undermined by its own fee practices.


Communication Gap: Nexo’s Defense Rings Hollow
In response to the growing discontent, Nexo attempted to quell the flames by claiming the new fees were simply passing on costs incurred with third-party payment processors. A company moderator further asserted Nexo’s commitment to “keep transactions accessible and affordable.” These justifications, however, fell flat with many users.

The lack of transparency and the absence of any prior warning were major sticking points. The timing, coming just weeks after the community lauded Nexo for reversing the loan repayment fee, added another layer of sting.

How Blockchain Technology Can Combat the Rising Threat of AI-Generated Deepfakes

For those unfamiliar, a public blockchain transparently records information in a time-bound manner, accessible to all, globally, and without gatekeeping. This allows anyone to verify the validity of information, such as its creator or a timestamp, making it a source of truth. Public blockchains are also decentralized, eliminating the need for a central decision-maker, and reducing the risk of manipulation. This decentralized structure also offers high network security by eliminating single points of failure, and ensuring an immutable and tamper-resistant record.

Elon Musk Issues 'Black Mirror' Warning, Shibarium on Verge of Major Record, Samson Mow Makes Bullish Bitcoin Statement: Crypto News Digest by U.Today


U.Today presents you with the top three news stories over the past day.Elon Musk issues important “Black Mirror” statement to warn communityIn a recent X post, Elon Musk, the world-famous centibillionaire who takes heightened interest in the latest technological developments, expressed his distrust in a new Microsoft feature. The feature is called "Recall" and, according to Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella, it represents a semantic search of users' entire history, which will help them find anything they have ever seen or done on their PCs. "Recall's" principle is simple: Windows will be constantly taking screenshots of your computer screen, then it will use a generative AI model, along with the NPU, to process all that data and make it searchable. Despite the promising utility, Musk criticized the feature, comparing it to what an episode of the "Black Mirror" series might show, implying that the series' dystopian scenario of technologies controlling humanity is getting closer to reality. "Definitely turning this 'feature' off," wrote Musk, perhaps hinting that the data collected by "Recall" could potentially be easily accessed and used to control users’ actions.Shibarium on verge of major record as transactions shoot up 209%Along with the rest of the market, Shibarium, Shiba Inu's layer-2 solution, has recently been seeing the positive effects of a new uptrend. According to data provided by Shibariumscan, the daily transaction count surged from 6,000 on May 14 to 18,560 on May 20, representing more than 209% growth. For weeks, the number of daily transitions on Shibarium remained relatively flat, but things changed after the Shibarium hard fork was implemented on the mainnet. This was a turning point for the Ethereum L2 protocol. With the transaction surge, Shibarium is now aiming to break the record of 420 million total transactions. Even though it remains unknown when exactly this will be accomplished, Shibarium has the right catalyst to help it drive its position to a new level overall. Currently, the total transaction count on Shibarium stands at 417,525,512, per Shibariumscan's data.Bullish Bitcoin statement issued by Samson Mow: “Omega coming”Bitcoin, the flagship cryptocurrency, has finally made the long-awaited move toward revisiting its all-time high, climbing back to the $71,000 level – the highest price level since April 1, when BTC traded at $71,330. The likely catalysts for BTC's sudden recovery were the positive CPI data, which showed a weakening inflation rate, as well as a whole week of inflows into Bitcoin ETFs. Such a positive change in the Bitcoin price could not go unnoticed by Jan3 CEO Samson Mow, a renowned BTC maximalist who once predicted that the aforementioned asset could reach as high as $1 million one day. Mow took to his X handle to comment on the BTC price surge, making yet another prediction; this time, it concerns the coming of an Omega Bitcoin candle soon. As previously explained by the CEO, an Omega candle is a large trading candle on a Bitcoin chart accompanied by high volatility moves. Meanwhile, Bitcoin is changing hands at $70,006, down by 0.25% over the past 24 hours, per CoinMarketCap.

Even Developers Aren't Sure How AI Models Work-But We're Finally Getting Answers - Decrypt

Generative artificial intelligence (AI) models can do pretty incredible things with just a prompt, but there’s a big open secret behind them: Even their creators don’t know exactly how they’re able to do what they do, or why such results can vary from prompt to prompt. But now, one of the most prominent generative AI model creators is starting to break open that “black box.”Anthropic, a leading AI research company formed by ex-OpenAI researchers, has published a paper detailing a new method for interpreting the inner workings of its large language model, Claude.This innovative approach, dubbed "dictionary learning," has allowed researchers to identify millions of connections—which they call “features”—within Claude's neural network, each representing a specific concept that the AI understands.The ability to identify and understand these features offers unprecedented insight into how a large language model (LLM) processes information (how it thinks) and generates responses (how it acts). It also gives Anthropic leverage in modifying models without having to retrain them. It could also pave the way for other researchers to apply the dictionary learning technique into their own weights, to understand their inner workings better and enhance them accordingly.Dictionary learning is a technique that breaks down the actions of a model into many easier-to-understand parts using a special type of neural network called a sparse autoencoder. This helps researchers identify and understand the "features," or key components within the model, making it clearer how the model processes and represents different ideas."We found millions of features which appear to correspond to interpretable concepts ranging from concrete objects like people, countries, and famous buildings to abstract ideas like emotions, writing styles, and reasoning steps," the research paper states.Anthropic coded some of these features for the public. Claude is able to create connections for things like the Golden Gate Bridge (code 34M/31164353) to abstract notions such as "internal conflicts and dilemmas" (F#1M/284095), names of famous people like Albert Einstein (F#4M/1456596) and even potential safety concerns like "influence/manipulation." (F#34M/21750411).“The interesting thing is not that these features exist, but that they can be discovered at scale and intervened on,” Anthropic explained, “In the long run, we hope that having access to features like these can be helpful for analyzing and ensuring the safety of models. For example, we might hope to reliably know whether a model is being deceptive or lying to us. Or we might hope to ensure that certain categories of very harmful behavior (e.g. helping to create bioweapons) can reliably be detected and stopped.”In a memo, Anthropic said that this technique helped it identify risky features and act promptly to reduce their influence.“For example, Anthropic researchers identified a feature corresponding to ‘unsafe code,’ which fires for pieces of computer code that disable security-related system features,” Anthropic explained. “When we prompt the model to continue a partially-completed line of code without artificially stimulating the ‘unsafe code’ feature, the model helpfully provides a safe completion to the programming function. However, when we force the ‘unsafe code’ feature to fire strongly, the model finishes the function with a bug that is a common cause of security vulnerabilities.”Image: AntrhopicThis ability to manipulate features to produce different results is akin to tweaking the settings on a complex machine—or hypnotizing a person. For instance, if a language model is too “politically correct,” then boosting the features that may activate its spicier side could effectively transform it into a radically different LLM, as if it had been trained from scratch. This ultimately results in a more flexible model, and an easier way of doing corrective maintenance when a bug is found.Traditionally, AI models have been seen as black boxes—highly complex systems whose internal processes are not easily interpretable. Anthropic claims to have advanced into fully opening its model’s black box, providing a clearer view of the AI's cognitive processes.Anthropic's research is a significant step towards demystifying AI, offering a glimpse into the complex cognitive processes of these advanced models. The company shared the results on Claude because the firm owns its weights, but independent researchers could take the open weights of any other LLM and adapt this technique to fine-tune a new model or understand how these open-source models process information."We believe that understanding the inner workings of large language models like Claude is crucial for ensuring their safe and responsible use," the researchers wrote.Edited by Andrew HaywardGenerally Intelligent NewsletterA weekly AI journey narrated by Gen, a generative AI model.

Here’s when Ethereum (ETH) could hit $5,000


    Ethereum (ETH) is on a bull rally amid positive expectations regarding the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) of the United States’ approval of Ethereum spot ETFs and BlackRock’s (NYSE: BLK) interest in real-world assets (RWA) tokenization.



Analysts started speculating on price as the cryptocurrency market awaits further developments in exchange-traded fund (ETF) approval and BlackRock’s endeavors. Reaching $5,000 in the next few days is possible as speculation heats up, even before the awaited ETF approval.



In particular, two analysts from the private wealth management firm Bernstein forecast a 75% pump to $6,600 moving forward. According to Gautam Chhugani and Mahika Sapra, ETH could mirror Bitcoin’s (BTC) gains after its ETFs’ approval earlier this year. DefiLlama reported this and six other experts’ opinions about Ethereum on May 22.







However, Ethereum could see some action before the forecasted $6,600 a few weeks after the effective approval, as reported. This is because cryptocurrency investors could try to price the approval firsthand, backed by other positive news.



Ethereum price analysis



In this context, it is possible that  ETH first tries to challenge its previous all-time high of $4,869. This could happen as Ethereum tests the $5,000 psychological resistance, right above the historical resistance.



Notably, the leading Web3 cryptocurrency shows strong momentum, according to its weekly relative strength index (RSI) of 65.18. ETH trades at $3,692 by press time.



ETH/USD weekly price chart. Source: TradingView / Finbold



Joe Lubin, co-founder of the Ethereum Foundation and founder of Consensys, is optimistic about the token’s price action.




“Expect a “floodgate” of demand for Ether, which will likely lead to a supply crunch and drive prices higher. There’s going to be a pretty large amount of natural, pent-up pressure to purchase Ether.”
– Joe Lubin




In the meantime, BlackRock has submitted an updated spot Ethereum ETF 19b-4 document, following the SEC’s guidance. The update addresses Ethereum staking by the funds, which BlackRock and other interested institutions state they will not engage with.







As things develop, traders and investors look forward to Ethereum price projections and a nearing $5,000 test. Still, cryptocurrencies are highly volatile and emotion-driven, so everything can quickly change. Speculators must remain cautious and avoid exposure above their risk profile.

First Solar Becomes Most Valuable Solar Company Amid Rivals' Struggles, Up 13% - Tokenist


					
Neither the author, Tim Fries, nor this website, The Tokenist, provide financial advice. Please consult our website policy prior to making financial decisions.



First Solar (NASDAQ: FSLR), a leading American solar panel manufacturer, has surpassed its competitors to become the most valuable solar company globally. The company’s market capitalization reached an impressive $21.15 billion, overtaking China’s Sungrow Power Supply Co., which stood at $20.85 billion. This achievement comes amidst significant challenges Chinese solar firms face, including a price war and trade barriers imposed by the United States.



Chinese Rivals’ Struggles and US Trade Policies



Chinese solar companies, such as Longi Green Energy Technology Co., have been grappling with the effects of a fierce price war and US trade restrictions. Longi reported a net loss of $325 million in the first quarter of 2024, starkly contrasting its $562 million profit the previous year.



The Biden administration’s tariffs on Chinese solar products and support for domestic manufacturers through the Inflation Reduction Act have played a pivotal role in bolstering First Solar’s market position. These tariffs have led to US solar panel prices being nearly three times higher than the global average.



Despite First Solar’s growing market capitalization, its production capacity still lags behind its Chinese counterparts. In 2023, First Solar produced 12 gigawatts of panels, while Jinko Solar Co. produced 79 gigawatts. However, the company’s strong financial performance and favorable stock outlook have contributed to its rising value.





First Solar Stock Gains Over 13%



As of the latest update, First Solar’s stock price stands at $240.61, having experienced a remarkable 13.44% increase over the day so far. Over the past year, the stock has traded between $123.50 and $256.78. The company’s market cap is currently $22.70 billion, with a trailing P/E ratio of 22.23 and a forward P/E of 16.03. First Solar’s price-to-book ratio is 3.29.



Regarding financial performance, First Solar boasts a profit margin of 28.75%, a return on assets of 7.18%, and a return on equity of 16.05%. The company reported revenue of $3.56 billion and a net income of $1.02 billion over the last twelve months. The stock has delivered impressive returns, with a year-to-date return of 33.61%, a one-year return of 13.10%, and three- and five-year returns of 203.16% and 290.55%, respectively.



Analysts have set price targets for First Solar ranging from $157.56 to $356.00, with a consensus recommendation of “Strong Buy.” The next earnings report is expected between July 25, 2024, and July 30, 2024.



Key Upgrades for First Solar (FSLR)



First Solar has recently received several notable upgrades from major financial institutions. UBS Group raised its price target from $252.00 to $270.00 and maintained a “buy” rating, resulting in a 2.8% increase in First Solar’s share price on the day of the announcement. Barclays increased its target price from $227.00 to $228.00, with an “overweight” rating, while Mizuho upped its price objective from $196.00 to $209.00, issuing a “buy” rating.



Morgan Stanley raised its price target from $245.00 to $248.00, maintaining an “overweight” rating, and Oppenheimer lifted its price objective from $269.00 to $271.00, providing an “outperform” rating. Jefferies Financial Group increased its price objective from $209.50 to $211.00, with a “buy” rating.

DOGE Skyrockets 100% in Whale Transactions Amid Dogecoin ETF Rumors


Dogecoin (DOGE), the famous meme-inspired cryptocurrency, is experiencing a surge in large transactions in the last 24 hours, indicating potential activity from major investors, or "whales."According to data from IntoTheBlock, the total value of these large transactions, exceeding $100,000, nearly doubled in the past 24 hours, jumping from $1.53 billion to a staggering $3.01 billion. This translates to a significant rise in the volume of DOGE being moved by these whales, from 9.74 billion to 17.97 billion coins.This surge in whale activity coincides with growing speculation about a potential Dogecoin ETF. The recent optimism surrounding the Ethereum ETF has fueled rumors that DOGE could be next in line for its own regulated investment vehicle.Source: IntoTheBlockWhy is Dogecoin ETF possible?Dogecoin appears to have several factors working in its favor for ETF approval. Unlike some other cryptocurrencies, DOGE is not suspected of being a security, its futures are already approved by the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) and it boasts a healthy market capitalization of $24 billion, ranking it as the eighth largest cryptocurrency.Interestingly, Billy Markus, one of the creators behind Dogecoin under the pseudonym Shibetoshi Nakamoto, has even chimed in on the ETF rumor with a lighthearted "amusing" remark. Whether fueled by these rumors or not, the recent surge in whale transactions suggests heightened interest in DOGE, and investors are watching closely to see if this translates to a price increase.

Perpetual futures contracts allow maximum gains, but traders should always consider the risk factors. Risks may include purchasing the altcoins with future threats, stronger wicks fund fluctuating prices, and loss from possible staking. 
Leverage enhances wicks, so handle the long-term trade very carefully. Liquidity mining and staking yields are compromised with a perpetual future, lowering long-term profits. The fluctuating funding reduces profits while a bullish market trend. So, perpetual futures have pitfalls like wicks staking loss funding rates issues despite high gains.

Crypto Futures vs. Traditional Futures – A Detailed and Comparative Analysis.

Factors to Consider While Trading in Crypto Perpetual Futures Contracts 
Cryptocurrency investors should consider the following factors in Crypto Futures Contracts

As a trader, you must be well aware of marketing analysis tools, including chart patterns, technical indicators, or support/resistance level. The knowledge of these tools will enhance your insight to analyse profitable trading business. You can take benefits by applying these techniques and took long or short position based upon market trends.

Set Stop Loss orders
You can also avoid the majority or the entire capital loss by applying stop loss order if the price of the asset moves adversely. The stop loss strategy ensures that the particular asset trade will be automatically closed if its price reaches the particular point. However you must also be very vigilant while the price movement is in a favorable direction to take benefit.  This technique is known as a discipline money management. 

Be Cautious About Funding Rates Fluctuations
Perpetual contracts embed a rate that is always charged every eight hours. These are also called inverse swaps. There can be no risk imbalances between buyers and sellers for exchange through funding rates. Although the interests of both buyers and sellers open matches at all times, leverage is subject to variation.

Crypto Futures Traders: What Are the 8 Common Trading Mistakes to Avoid?

The funding rate increases when the buyers long ask for greater leverage. Consequently, the fees will be covered by those buyers. This problem is particularly prevalent during bull run periods when there is typically a greater demand for longs.

ETHUSDT is an ETH/USDT perpetual futures contract priced on the BETHT Index. Each contract has a value equal to its price in Tether. The funding cost is paid and received every 8 hours. ETHUSDT uses a Premium index to calculate funding rates. 
The chart shows that the ETH USDT market made a bullish trend on November 10, 2023, raising its value to $2,118. After that, the market showed a slightly bearish trend and declined to $1,924 on November 17, 2023. 
However, it should be noted that some exchanges will allow manual selection of rates and set borrowing periods by users. This attitude is far better since unpleasant surprises are presented in this case, which will certainly occur after a large-scale buying activity.
Although perpetual futures trading is an excellent tool, it has shortcomings. Among those are stronger wicks running stop losses, inability to do staking, and the variable funding rate.
Leverage Results in More Powerful Wicks
The leverage will only lead to stronger wicks regardless of the market’s liquidity. Even though these moves usually do not result in a forced liquidation, they might run investors’ stops.
Thus, the principal reason why carrying futures positions for extended periods should be shunned is the probability of errant wicks.

Learn all about perpetual futures contracts in the cryptocurrency market, from their mechanics to trading strategies, with this comprehensive article.

Futures liquidation engines use price indexes from several spot (regular) exchanges to avoid price manipulation. So, the system will close positions with insufficient margin only once an index reaches its stops.


We have pasted screenshots of the two major crypto exchanges, Binance and Coinbase. You have noticed that at the same moment, Binance is showing a BTC price of $69,852, which is lower than the price of the same asset at Coinbase is $70,244. Although the change is small, it can cause traders to close trades. 

Understand how liquidity pools are transforming the crypto futures market and their impact on your trading strategies with this comprehensive article.

Traders also have options to avoid such issues. They can change the trigger of stop orders from the last price to the Mark Price (Index). This simple strategy can save traders from liquidation, provided perpetual futures contracts separate monetarily from their index. 

Conclusion
So that’s it! If you’ve read the following sections, you should be familiar with what a perpetual futures contracts in crypto is and how to start perpetual contracts trading yourself with the help of one of the leading crypto exchanges on the market.

Learn the strategies and intricacies of perpetual swap contracts trading to enhance your 2024 investment tactics with this comprehensive article.

But, of course, being that this is such a broad subject, there are many things that we need more time to touch on, such as the question of whether perpetual futures contracts are enforceable, the funding fees mentioned above, and so on. Either way, you have a solid foundation for expanding your perpetual futures contract trading knowledge further.

Scarlett Johansson may have a case in OpenAI voice dispute


While Protos usually covers Sam Altman when he’s launching cryptocurrencies or scanning eyeballs, OpenAI and its CEO have recently made waves for other reasons: namely, it appears as though Altman and his team reached out to actress Scarlett Johansson, asked for her to be a voice for OpenAI, were refused permission, and chose to pursue a similar voice actor to create the voice instead.
AI advocates have been quick to suggest that, because it wasn’t Johansson herself, there would be no room for a possible lawsuit against OpenAI. As it turns out, things may not be that simple.
Indeed, there are many cases that suggest Johansson would not only have a case but would likely win.

Bette Midler v Ford Motor Company
In 1985, an advertising agency made a series of commercials for the Ford Lincoln Mercury that utilized hit music from the ‘70s but almost exclusively relied on sound-alike singers. One of these songs was Do You Want To Dance from Bette Midler’s album The Divine Miss M. Apparently, a brief phone interaction between the ad agency and Midler’s agent went as follows:
Ad Agent: Hello, I am Craig Hazen from Young and Rubicam. I am calling you to find out if Bette Midler would be interested in doing . . .?
Midler’s Agent: Is it a commercial?
Ad Agent: Yes.
Midler’s Agent: We are not interested.
The ad agency already had a license from the copyright holder to use the song and had a sound-alike sing it for the ad. Midler was alerted to it when ‘a number of people’ reached out to her to say it sounded exactly like her. A lawsuit followed.
Midler lost the initial case but won on appeal.
Importantly, the court asked, “Why did the defendants ask Midler to sing if her voice was not of value to them? Why did they studiously acquire the services of a sound-alike and instruct her to imitate Midler if Midler’s voice was not of value to them?” It then answered those questions in the next sentence, stating “What they sought was an attribute of Midler’s identity. Its value was what the market would have paid for Midler to have sung the commercial in person.”
While the case revolved around a singer, her song, and the use of both in an ad, it wasn’t those aspects that won her the case. Most importantly the court said “To impersonate her voice is to pirate her identity.”
Tom Waits v Frito-Lay
While Midler had the fact that she was a superstar and that the advertising agency had reached out to her representative and asked her to sing on her side in her court case, Tom Waits had no such advantages.
In his case against Frito-Lay, Waits sued the chip manufacturer for creating a radio jingle that sounded exactly like him.
Although no one from the ad agency reached out to Waits or his representatives, they did a ‘search for a lead singer for the commercial [that] suggests that no one would do but a singer who could not only capture the feeling of [Tom Waits’ 1976 song] Step Right Up but also imitate Tom Waits’ voice.’
The ad agency found a Waits impersonator and hired him to sing a song about Doritos. A video by Rock N’ Roll True Stories plays the embarrassing fake Tom Waits Frito Lay radio commercial here.
In the lead-up to the first airing of the ad, Frito-Lay reached out to the ad agency to ask if they could get sued for releasing it. The attorney for the ad agency said “there was a ‘high-profile’ risk of a lawsuit in view of recent case law recognizing the protectability of a distinctive voice,” adding “based on what Grossman had told him, however, the attorney did not think such a suit would have merit, because a singer’s style of music is not protected.”
Unfortunately for the ad agency lawyers, a jury decided in Waits’ favor even though they didn’t know of him and ‘thought [he] was a criminal’ the first time they saw him. Frito-Lay appealed.
Waits won on appeal, with the Ninth Circuit reaffirming almost all of the jury’s decisions, including his award for punitive damages of $2 million.
Vanna White v Samsung Electronics America
Wheel of Fortune hostess Vanna White sued Samsung for an ad it ran that featured a robot game show hostess. While it didn’t use her voice or name, it wore an outfit like White’s on Wheel of Fortune.
It turns out that even that was enough to win a court case.
The appeals court stated, “The right of publicity does not require that appropriations of identity be accomplished through particular means to be actionable,” adding that “if we treated the means of appropriation as dispositive in our analysis of the right of publicity, we would not only weaken the right but effectively eviscerate it.”

Honorable mention: Crispin Glover v Universal Pictures
Famously, Crispin Glover turned down a part in Back to the Future Part II because he didn’t like the script. But that didn’t stop Universal Pictures from using old footage, prosthetics, and face masks to recreate him in the Back to the Future sequel, and that pissed Glover off.
Upon receiving the lawsuit, Universal filed a demurrer arguing that ‘the publicity rights claim should fail because the filmmakers were only trying to perpetuate the George McFly character.’ This argument was rejected by the judge and, ultimately, the case was settled in (presumably) Glover’s favor.
Not federal law
Of course, none of these cases were taken to the Supreme Court in the US, and right to publicity has largely been decided state-by-state, so no one knows what could transpire on a federal level. It’s possible that Johansson doesn’t attempt to take OpenAI on for their misuse of a voice, particularly as it was quickly pulled.
While the demo video of the new OpenAI used Johansson-modelled ‘Sky’ voice, it’s unclear if this is enough to seek punitive damages or if Johansson is interested in spending years of time litigating against Microsoft and OpenAI.
Regardless, this marks a watershed moment where actors, artists, writers, and other creators will need to see how far they’re willing to let artificial intelligence go before it crosses the line on their rights to privacy and publicity.

U.S. Congressman warns CBDCs 'threaten to destroy the American way of life’


    Congressman Tom Emmer spoke in the House of Representatives against Central Bank Digital Currencies (CBDCs), warning they are surveillance tools. Emmer has been against the U.S. current CBDC project for a while and is now doubling down on his stance.



Notably, the Congressman’s most recent appearance was in a video shared through his official X account on May 22. Before that, Tom Emmer gave an interview to Bloomberg on May 20, addressing a similar stance. According to him, the House of Republicans will take action to prevent the Federal Reserve from issuing a CBDC.



In this most recent speech, the U.S. Congressman warned CBDCs “threaten to destroy the American way of life.” This was said while Tom Emmer presented the “CBDC Anti-Surveillance State Act.”








“With this legislation, we are going to stop unelected bureaucrats in the Biden Administration from using a Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC), that threatens to destroy the American way of life.”
– Tom Emmer








Congressman Tom Emmer: CBDCs must be like cash



Interestingly, Emmer continued his speech by comparing CBDCs with decentralized cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin (BTC) and mentioning the properties of the competing tools.




“Unlike decentralized digital assets such as Bitcoin, CBDCs are a digital form of a sovereign currency designed, issued, and monitored by the Federal Government. In short, a CBDC is a government-controlled, programable money that, if not designed to be just like cash—open, permissionless, and Private (with a capital P)—it not only could it will give the federal government significant transaction-level data and individuals an ability to suppress politically unpopular activity.”
– Tom Emmer




The Congressman mentioned the example of China weaponizing its Central Bank Digital Currency against its citizens, besides other countries. Moreover, Tom Emmer warned about a Federal Reserve document highlighting CBDCs as one of their key duties moving forward.



“In doing this, the Biden Administration has proven they are itching to trade Americans’ right to privacy for a CCP-style CBDC surveillance tool,” concluded the U.S. Representative.



However, he explained that the “CBDC Anti-Surveillance State Act” will not prevent a CBDC from existing. The bill aims to ensure that the centralized monetary system can maintain cash’s attributes as permissionless and “Private (with a capital P)” and guarantee individual sovereignty.

There's Been A Serious Pump In Big Memecoin: Two Whales Bought Hours Earlier - Bitcoin Sistemi

In days when a very enthusiastic atmosphere prevails in the cryptocurrency market, memecoins do not stop their upward movements.
As it is known, it is almost certain that the SEC will approve Ethereum Spot ETFs, and the final decision date for these ETFs is tomorrow.


As the possibility of approval increased, almost all memecoins, especially PEPE, were positively affected.
Today, the significant rise of a memecoin attracts attention in the cryptocurrency market. The altcoin named Dogwifhat (WIF) experienced a significant rally during the day, rising from $ 2.71 to over $ 3.20.





Graph showing the rise in WIF price.
Whales did not sit idle during the rise of WIF. According to Onchain data, two cryptocurrency whales seem to have benefited from this rise.

The first whale, with short address 37reKQ, purchased 453,877 WIF tokens at $2.89, paying $1.31 million. Then, with the rally in WIF, the unrealized profit level of the whale is around 161 thousand dollars at the time of writing this article.


The second whale with short address 8rWUUy used $730 thousand SOL to buy 247,791 WIFs at $2.95 and currently holds a total of $4.5 million WIF.
Both whales are currently profitable, but PEPE's performance has been superior to WIF so far, even accounting for WIF's recent rise. One of the reasons for this may be that PEPE is Ethereum-based while WIF is Solana-based. There is a lot of hype in the Ethereum ecosystem right now due to ETFs.

Azuki 'Satoshi Nakamoto' Hoodie Is Tokenized on Both Bitcoin and Ethereum - Decrypt

Ethereum NFT project Azuki and multi-chain marketplace Magic Eden have teamed up to create what they’re calling the first dual-chain NFT product that exists on both the Bitcoin and Ethereum blockchains—a limited edition hoodie inspired by the creator of Bitcoin, represented by an NFT on both chains.The Azuki x Satoshi Nakamoto Enduro Hoodie, first revealed last fall, was created exclusively for holders of Azuki's "Spirits" NFTs—so there are just 98 pieces in total. The hoodies serve as a tribute to Bitcoin's pseudonymous creator Satoshi Nakamoto.Each hoodie contains an embedded chip that allows owners to scan it and mint a corresponding NFT as proof of ownership and authenticity on Ethereum—but also an NFT-like Ordinals inscription on Bitcoin.The hoodies utilize Azuki’s own Physical Backed Token (PBT) technology per the Ethereum Improvement Proposal EIP-5791 standard. Ownership transfers require a signature from the physical chip embedded in each hoodie, creating what Azuki calls “decentralized on-chain verification combined with off-chain ownership."“The ownership on ETH is still tied to immutable art on BTC,” Azuki and Magic Eden noted in a statement. “The concept was built around the desire to collect and trade artifacts in a user-friendly way, which led to programming on EVM while keeping the art enshrined on BTC.”Azuki is one of the most prominent NFT properties, with more than $1.1 billion to date worth of trading volume for its original Ethereum collection alone, per CryptoSlam.Magic Eden has been the leading NFT marketplace by trading volume in recent months, thanks in part to its early bet on Bitcoin Ordinals. The marketplace also supports the recently launched Bitcoin Runes tokens.Editor’s note: This article was written with the assistance of AI.

Ripple Vs. SEC Lawsuit: Latest Filing Marks Beginning Of The End Of Historic Battle | Bitcoinist.com


								The long-running legal battle between the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and Ripple is one step closer to an end with the Commission’s latest filing. The court is expected to give its judgment soon enough, as both parties have filed all necessary briefs. 
What The SEC’s Latest Filing Is About
The Commission filed a letter in opposition to Ripple’s motion to seal certain documents related to the remedies stage. In line with an earlier report, the SEC noted that they weren’t opposing Ripple’s requests in its entirety. For the opposed redactions, the Commission argued that the crypto firm had failed to “overcome the strong presumption that court filings should be public.”

The regulator mentioned that the materials they oppose a redaction are “fundamental to the rationale behind the SEC’s requested remedies.” The SEC further noted that Ripple had invited the public to form an opinion about the merits of the Commission’s positions. As such, the crypto firm cannot “simultaneously hide” from the public the evidence on which the SEC’s position is based. 
Furthermore, the SEC claimed that Ripple’s argument that failure to redact these documents could harm its business doesn’t eliminate the burden of proof on the crypto firm to show “exceptional circumstances” that justify sealing or redacting. Ripple had also cited earlier instances in the case where the court agreed to certain requests for sealing and redactions. 
However, the Commission claims it doesn’t “justify” Ripple’s requests as it tried to differentiate those earlier events from the case at hand. Firstly, they noted that the court’s earlier rulings regarding redactions were “in the context of specific filings, not for the rest of the case.” Unlike then, the financial information and offering terms the firm seeks to seal “is now at the crux of the remedies decision,” the SEC remarked. 
Secondly, the SEC argued that the documents that Ripple seeks to seal are ones which it would have been legally mandated to disclose in the first place since the court had already ruled that the firm’s institutional sales were investment contracts. Lastly, the Commission argued that these documents were already “stale” and there was no need to hide them. 
When Is A Final Judgment Expected For Ripple?
Judge Analisa Torres is expected to give her final judgment soon enough since both parties have filed all their respective briefs according to the scheduling order. However, before then, the Judge will need to rule on Ripple’s sealing motion and decide whether or not the crypto firm’s financial information should be made public. 

Following the ruling, Ripple will have fourteen days to file a public or redacted version (depending on the court’s ruling) of the documents in question. After this has been done, the court can then proceed to give its final judgment. The SEC has proposed that Judge Torres order a fine against Ripple summing up to almost $2 billion.
Meanwhile, Ripple has opposed the proposed remedies and asked that the court limit any proposed fine to just $10 million.

What a Potential Ethereum Spot ETF Could Mean for Cryptocurrencies?

It goes without saying that cryptocurrency and digital asset adoption has reached an inflection point. The recent approval of several Bitcoin Spot ETFs in the United States marked a significant milestone for Bitcoin and the entire crypto market as a whole.

Last year, we speculated on the prospect of these approvals and what impact it could have on the markets. 

Since the approvals in January, the cryptocurrency markets have entered a raging bull market with increased deliberation among the mainstream media. This week, we see yet another turning point towards widespread adoption with the chatter of the SEC (Securities and Exchange Commission) potentially approving several Ethereum Spot ETFs amidst a political backdrop in the US that is becoming increasingly crypto-friendly. 
Even though rumors of the Ethereum Spot ETF have been floating around for months, it wasn’t until this week when real traction grew. The SEC began actively engaging with issuers and national exchanges, mirroring the approach taken prior to the approval of the Bitcoin Spot ETFs. This blog explores what an approval could bring to Ethereum, altcoins and the cryptocurrency sector as a whole over the short term and long term. 

The SEC’s Stance on Ethereum 
The second largest cryptocurrency, Ethereum, has been in the crossfire with the United States’ SEC for years. Ever since Ethereum’s transition from proof of work (PoW) to proof of stake (PoS) in 2022, the SEC under the helm of Gary Gensler has been maneuvering to classify Ethereum as a security rather than a commodity. Shortly after the Merge, Gary Gensler stated that tokens in a PoS consensus system could be considered securities since investors rely on the efforts of others to make a profit. 
Classifying Ethereum as a security poses significant drawbacks for the crypto market. Such a designation would subject Ethereum to stringent regulatory requirements, potentially stifling innovation and deterring investment. 
The increased compliance costs and legal uncertainties could hinder the development of decentralized applications (dApps) and other blockchain-based technologies built on the Ethereum network. 
Furthermore, it might prompt exchanges to delist Ethereum to avoid the complexities of trading securities, reducing its liquidity and accessibility for investors. This regulatory shift could create a ripple effect, impacting the broader crypto ecosystem and slowing the adoption of blockchain technology. 
In early 2024, the SEC began investigating Ethereum, issuing subpoenas to U.S. entities connected to the Ethereum Foundation. This move raised questions about whether it is part of a broader effort to classify ether as a security, possibly slashing hopes that the regulator will approve Ethereum Spot ETFs. Until last week, this mounting bearish stance pushed the odds of an Ethereum spot ETF being approved to 10%. 

Over the past week, however, the SEC has seemingly done a 180 on their stance on Ethereum. On Monday, news that the SEC had informed exchanges the agency was leaning towards approving Ethereum spot ETFs shook the world of cryptocurrencies.  
Possible Impact of an Approval 
Price Appreciation
While the decision on the Ethereum Spot ETF’s to be authorized is still pending, it is interesting to speculate on some of the scenarios that could take place. One such is an Ethereum price surge. This scenario has in fact already taken place. Since the news broke, Ethereum’s price rallied a staggering 20% in a single day. 

Some on twitter are also of the opinion that the news has not been priced in. Others view the break of structure as an indicator of the start of a longer-term parabolic bull market. 

To understand market sentiment and the characteristics that typify a crypto bull and bear market, read this article: Bull and Bear Markets Explained: A Guide to Maximizing Profits in Crypto 



Even though predicting short term price swings can be difficult, the recent surge in Bitcoin’s price following its ETF approvals may signal similar trends for Ethereum. 
An Altcoin Season 
An approval of Ethereum Spot ETFs could potentially trigger an altcoin season by significantly boosting investor confidence in the broader cryptocurrency market. Ethereum, as the second largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, holds a pivotal role in the crypto ecosystem. Its recognition and validation through a spot ETF would likely attract a wave of institutional and retail investment. 
This influx of capital could not only drive up the price of Ethereum but also increase interest in other altcoins, as investors look to diversify their portfolios and capitalize on the broader market momentum. 
Historically, major developments and positive regulatory news for bluechip cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum have had a cascading effect, lifting the entire market. 

Read this article for an introductory guide on what altcoins are and their different types: A Brief Overview of Altcoins: What are Their Types, Pros and Cons 

Moreover, an Ethereum Spot ETF approval could pave the way for a broader trend of crypto ETFs gaining regulatory approval. Established protocols like Solana are already being speculated as the next candidates for such recognition. 


Increased Institutional Adoption 
One possible scenario following the approval of an Ethereum Spot ETF is a significant increase in institutional adoption of Ethereum. With a spot ETF, traditional financial institutions such as mutual funds, pension funds, and hedge funds would have a regulated and accessible way to gain exposure to Ethereum without the complexities of directly purchasing and storing the cryptocurrency. 
This could lead to a substantial influx of institutional capital into the market, which would not only drive up the price of Ethereum but also enhance its legitimacy as a mainstream investment asset. 
We have already seen this play out with the Bitcoin ETFs with large hedge funds accumulating the digital asset at unprecedented rates. 

Easier Accessibility
Ethereum Spot ETFs will significantly enhance accessibility for people interested in investing in cryptocurrencies without having to navigate the complex technicalities of the Web3 ecosystem. 
Traditionally, investing in Ethereum requires a basic understanding of setting up crypto wallets, managing private keys, and purchasing the asset via cryptocurrency exchanges—all of which can be challenging for those unfamiliar with this space. With the introduction of Ethereum Spot ETFs, investors can bypass these hurdles. 

Read this article for an end-to-end guide on cryptocurrency wallets: Cryptocurrency Wallets: Explained

These ETFs, traded on traditional stock exchanges, offer a familiar and regulated investment vehicle that simplifies the process. This ease of access means that anyone with a brokerage account can gain exposure to Ethereum just as easily as they would with stocks or conventional ETFs.
The availability of Ethereum Spot ETFs will diversify the investor base by attracting people who use legacy investment platforms. By offering a product that fits within the existing framework of traditional finance, Ethereum Spot ETFs open the market to a broader audience, including institutional investors, retirement funds, and everyday individuals who prefer the security and simplicity of regulated financial products. 
Closing Thoughts 
The prospect of an Ethereum Spot ETF approval stands to significantly shake up the crypto sector, with both short-term and long-term implications. The approval of Ethereum Spot ETFs would mark a pivotal step towards mainstream adoption and integration of cryptocurrencies into the global financial system. 
While the decision for approval remains to be seen at the time of this writing, the mere possibility and the precedent set by approved Bitcoin ETFs speak volumes about the progress and maturation of the cryptocurrency industry since its inception 15 years ago. 
The journey of digital assets from a niche investment opportunity to a significant component of the financial landscape underscores its transformative potential and the capacity to redefine financial paradigms.

MetaMask set to integrate native Bitcoin functionality - CoinJournal



                    

                    
MetaMask integrating native Bitcoin support, bridging Ethereum-Bitcoin gap.
Although no exact timelines, the integration is expected within a month.
Currently, MetaMask uses Wrapped Bitcoin (WBTC) to bridge Bitcoin to Ethereum’s decentralized applications.

MetaMask, renowned as the most-used Ethereum (ETH) wallet, is poised to transcend one of the biggest tribal divides in the crypto sphere by extending support to Bitcoin (BTC).
The move, anticipated within the next month, will mark a significant step towards interoperability in the ever-expanding world of cryptocurrencies.
This news comes at the backdrop of Metamask’s integration with Coinbase Onramp allowing Coinbase users with an active Coinbase account to seamlessly buy and transfer crypto directly to their MetaMask wallet by selecting the Coinbase Pay option.
Bitcoin addition part of MetaMask’s multi-chain approach
This development underscores MetaMask’s commitment to embracing a multi-chain approach in the Web3 landscape.
Currently, MetaMask does not directly facilitate Bitcoin transactions but utilizes Wrapped Bitcoin (WBTC), an Ethereum-compatible ERC-20 token, to bridge Bitcoin to Ethereum’s decentralized applications.
However, the forthcoming integration of native Bitcoin functionality within MetaMask holds the potential to streamline user interactions across different blockchain ecosystems, fostering greater interoperability and expanding the utility of both Ethereum and Bitcoin for users worldwide.
With over 30 million monthly active users, MetaMask serves as a vital gateway into the world of decentralized applications (dApps) and non-fungible tokens (NFTs) on the Ethereum blockchain.
As Ethereum continues to pioneer innovations like smart contracts, MetaMask has played a crucial role in facilitating user navigation within this smart contract-based environment.
Now, with plans to incorporate Bitcoin functionality, MetaMask is poised to broaden its utility and appeal to a wider audience of cryptocurrency enthusiasts.
No exact timeline for the integration
While the exact timeline for the integration remains uncertain, sources familiar with the matter suggest that access to native Bitcoin functionality could arrive within the MetaMask platform in the coming month.
However, the specific features and capabilities of Bitcoin support are yet to be finalized. It is anticipated that initial functionalities may be limited, with expansions and enhancements rolled out gradually over time.
MetaMask’s parent company, ConsenSys, led by Ethereum co-founder Joe Lubin, has expressed excitement about the prospect of embracing the multi-chain world of Web3.
A spokesperson for MetaMask emphasized the company’s ongoing commitment to enhancing usability and security while exploring new integrated features for its self-custodial wallet.

House of Representatives To Vote on Major Crypto Bill by the End of This Week - Here’s What It’s About - The Daily Hodl


								The U.S. House of Representatives is gearing up to vote on a major crypto bill that aims to clarify how digital assets are regulated.
The bipartisan “Financial Innovation and Technology for the 21st Century Act” would empower the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) to regulate crypto assets as commodities if the blockchain they run on is sufficiently decentralized.










The bill says decentralized blockchains can’t be controlled unilaterally by any one person. The potential legislation also states that no issuer or affiliated person can control 20% or more of the digital assets or the voting power of a decentralized chain.
Digital assets associated with blockchains that aren’t decentralized would be regulated by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) as securities.
Eight Republicans and three Democrats have sponsored the bill, which is widely expected to go to a vote this week.
The Blockchain Association, a crypto lobbying group, has expressed support for the potential legislation, and a16z Crypto, the digital asset investment arm of venture capital giant Andreessen Horowitz, says the act would “give blockchain projects a pathway to safely and effectively launch” in the United States.
House Democratic leaders don’t plan to whip against the bill but have expressed their opposition to the potential legislation, according to a report from Politico journalist Eleanor Mueller.
In an email sent to Democratic House members, the party leadership argues that the bill “undermines decades of legal precedent and case law, thereby creating uncertainty in our traditional securities market.”
“The bill also provides a safe harbor in which entities can file an “intent to register” if they meet certain requirements, effectively shielding them from SEC rules and regulations until SEC and CFTC finalize their rules, which weakens investor protections and opens the door to fraud and market manipulation.”

The Protocol: EIGEN Riches Tempt Ethereum Devs, Even as ETF Approval Nears

MEV SNIPING! It's not clear exactly what started it all, but top Ethereum developers locked horns on the social-media platform X, in an intense and almost uncomfortable-to-observe debate touching on the practice of maximal extractable value, or MEV – essentially, the use of sophisticated trading bots to frontrun user transactions at the point of execution. On May 16, Ethereum core developer Péter Szilágyi tweeted about his despair over the lack of progress in pushing to solve some of the blockchain's most vexing issues. "Voila, the banking system recreated," he wrote. One of his points was that Ethereum had "glorified" MEV, remarking, ostensibly in sarcasm, that it was "futile to fight against MEV, so might as well lean hard on it, right?" (As chronicled in last week's issue of The Protocol, even U.S. government officials now appear to characterize MEV as standard operating procedure on the blockchain.) Ethereum Foundation researcher Dankrad Feist retweeted Szilágyi's post with the comment, "This is such a lazy take if you can't also tell me what your supposed solutions are that let local block producers extract MEV." A back-and-forth ensued, and then Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin chimed in, tweeting that "I'm really proud that Ethereum does not have any culture of trying to prevent people from speaking their minds, even when they have very negative feelings toward major things in the protocol or ecosystem." Buterin, who is known to write long, interrupted his work on a project in Kenya to bang out a 3,000-word-plus essay breaking down the issues, concluding: "I also do not think that the situation is anywhere near as hopeless as Peter's tweets imply."

Good News from the USA to Binance! The Court Cancelled the Prohibition Decision! - Bitcoin Sistemi


Good news came from the USA for Binance, the world's largest cryptocurrency exchange.
According to Bloomberg, the Florida Court of Appeals overturned the Binance ban.


Accordingly, the First District Court of Appeal in Florida overturned the ban on Binance on May 22 with a unanimous decision.
In its decision, the court said state regulators did not follow proper procedures when banning Binance in November 2023.





The court ruled that Binance's operations in the state could not be blocked under the emergency cease-and-desist order issued by the Florida Office of Financial Regulation.
The Court of Appeals also stated that the Florida Office of Financial Regulation did not consider CZ's conduct to be grounds for suspending the license of Binance's Florida subsidiary.


Florida regulators' decision to suspend Binance came after former Binance CEO Changpeng Zhao pleaded guilty to criminal charges.

Is Donald Trump Accepting Crypto Donations 'Just Another Cow For Him To Milk?' - Benzinga

Former President Donald Trump is now accepting cryptocurrency for official campaign donations, a move that has garnered mixed reactions from experts in the crypto industry. While some see this as a strategic play to attract crypto enthusiasts, others remain skeptical about Trump’s genuine commitment to the sector.Experts Split On Trump's Move To Accept Crypto DonationsDavid Hoffman, Co-owner at Bankless, dismissed the significance of Trump’s move, stating, “I'm not going to celebrate Donald Trump accepting crypto donations. It's trivial. Thinking it's ‘embracing the industry' is naive. Trump has not shown any true commitment to crypto. So far, we are just another cow for him to milk.”In contrast, Ryan Selkis, founder & CEO at Messari Crypto, views Trump's acceptance of crypto donations more positively.“You can now support the first pro-crypto major presidential candidate, President Trump…with crypto,” Selkis said, adding, “Liz had an army. We have a hulk.”Selkis also highlighted Trump's recent influence on the crypto market and regulatory environment, noting, “In one week, [Trump] sparked a $200 billion+ crypto market rally, forced Senate Dems into submission on SAB 121, forced the resignation of the FDIC Chair, forced the SEC to reverse course on its ETF approval, and upped FIT 21 odds of passage.”The Shift To Crypto Donations: Strategic Move Or Token Gesture?In early May, Trump indicated his support for the cryptocurrency sector, announcing that his campaign would begin accepting crypto donations.“If you like crypto in any form…if you’re in favor of crypto you’d better vote for Trump,” the former president remarked at the time.Also Read: Ethereum ETF Launch Potentially Still Weeks Away, Says Bloomberg AnalystTrump Campaign First Major Party To Embrace Crypto DonationsOn Tuesday, Trump's presidential election campaign became the first major party campaign to accept cryptocurrency donations. A statement from the campaign reads, “This addition to President Trump’s already groundbreaking digital fundraising operation marks the first time a major party Presidential nominee has embraced cryptocurrencies for donations.”The fundraising initiative adheres to Federal Election Commission regulations and will accept any cryptocurrency currently supported by Coinbase Commerce, including Bitcoin BTC/USD, Ethereum ETH/USD, Solana SOL/USD, Tether USDT/USD, Rippple XRP/USD, Dogecoin DOGE/USD, Cardano ADA/USD, Shiba Inu SHIB/USD, and Avalanche AVAX/USD.Eric.eth commented on the broader political landscape, "It AMAZES me that people in crypto are still out here defending Biden. The guy has outright assaulted our industry for 4 years. ‘Ya but Trump may change tone once elected' is max cope. No proof whatsoever that’s true. Are you people OK? Blink twice if you need help."Comparing Crypto Strategies: Trump vs. KennedyTrump’s decision to accept cryptocurrency donations comes as a strategic move to attract crypto-friendly voters, particularly as independent competitor Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has been accepting Bitcoin donations for months. This effort is seen as a counter to the anti-crypto stance of President Joe Biden and several Democratic leaders, including Senator Elizabeth Warren.The campaign website promotes Trump's stance on new technologies, stating, “Trump stands ready to embrace new technologies that will Make America Great Again.”It further emphasizes Trump’s track record in reducing regulations and supporting financial innovation, contrasting it with the Democratic approach of more stringent government controls.Political And Market ImpactAs Trump's campaign aims to build a “crypto army” to secure victory in the 2024 election, this move could significantly influence the cryptocurrency market and its regulatory landscape. Joe Lubin, co-founder of Ethereum and ConsenSys, remarked, “The resulting ‘floodgate' of demand for Ether will likely lead to a supply crunch. There's going to be a pretty large amount of natural, pent-up pressure to purchase Ether.”The broader implications of this development, including regulatory trends and market dynamics, will be explored at Benzinga’s Future of Digital Assets event on Nov. 19. Industry leaders, investors, and policymakers will gather to discuss the evolving role of digital assets in the global financial landscape.Read Next: Bitcoin Spot ETFs See Seventh Straight Day Of Inflows With $306MImage created using artificial intelligence with Midjourney.

Bitcoin Market Not 'Top Heavy' Yet But More Consolidation Expected: Analysts


																BTC prices have retreated back below $70,000 during Wednesday morning’s Asian trading session but markets are not overbought yet, according to analyst James Check.
“Right now, using a variety of volume metrics as the input, BTC prices appear to be right in line with the fundamentals,” he said in a newsletter on May 21.
Moreover, the market looks like it did in late-2020, he added.
In early December 2020, BTC prices rose to reclaim its 2017 all-time high of $20,000. It consolidated around this level for a couple of weeks before surging to a new peak of $30,000 by New Year’s Day.


History Rhyming?
During this recent cycle, BTC prices have climbed to almost reclaim their mid-March peak of $73,738 but have found resistance there, indicating positive momentum and potential for entering price discovery territory.




“Only seven days in all history have a closing price above this [$71,000], so we are really breathing thin air up here,” said the analyst.
He added that “punching a convincing all-time-high is rarely successful on the first go” before stating that a period of “chopping wood” and a couple of significant attempts is very normal.
Moreover, the Network Value to Transactions (NVT) ratio suggests that bitcoin’s price is in line with its on-chain transaction throughput, similar to the conditions seen during late 2020.
Additionally, the short-term holder Spent Output Profit Ratio (SOPR) shows that the market is in an “enthusiastic” but not “euphoric” phase, indicating a potentially sustainable uptrend.
This is a condition in which a significant number of holders are caught off guard and buy too many coins at too high a price.
The Glassnode analyst also mentions a “top-heavy” market condition, where a significant number of investors are holding assets at a loss. However, he notes that this condition has improved significantly, with only 6.6% of the short-term holder supply now held at a loss, reducing the risk of panic selling.
More Chopsolidation Ahead
On May 21, fellow analyst “Rekt Capital” predicted that a weekly candle close above $71,500 “would probably kickstart the breakout from the re-accumulation range.” However, BTC prices had already dipped to $69,782 at the time of writing.
He added that history suggests BTC should consolidate inside this re-accumulation range for several weeks more.

5 Stocks Orbiting Nvidia's Earnings Report Today - Tokenist


					
Neither the author, Tim Fries, nor this website, The Tokenist, provide financial advice. Please consult our website policy prior to making financial decisions.



When Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) released its earnings report in February for (fiscal) Q4 ‘24, it significantly impacted other tech stocks. Having exceeded expectations and outperformed in data center revenue, the chipmaker bumped the NASDAQ 100 (NDX) index by 3% into the next day.



This is not surprising with Nvidia’s current market cap gravity pull of $2.38 trillion. Having started the year with $1.22 trillion, this is an impressive 95% growth of value. Effectively, NVDA stock became a proxy for all things related to generative AI infrastructure, although AMD’s MI300X chips are heading to be more cost effective.



After the market closes on May 22nd, Nvidia is scheduled to release the earnings report for fiscal Q1 2025, ending April 2024. Considering Nvidia’s heavy gravity, let’s look at five stocks that are directly involved with the company or could be lifted by Nvidia’s AI tide. 



SoundHound AI (NASDAQ: SOUN)



Notwithstanding Nvidia’s disclosure of 1.73 million SOUN shares at the end of 2023, SoundHound AI is a sound investor choice in its own right. The Santa Clara startup leverages the need for natural voice interfacing powered by machine learning. 



Alongside food chains like White Castle and Krispy Kreme, SoundHound’s AI-powered voice systems found themselves in leading auto brands under the Stellantis umbrella, including Kia, Hyundai, and Honda. Owing to the NVIDIA DRIVE framework, SoundHound is working toward AI interactions without cloud connectivity.



In February’s earnings for Q1, the company reported a 73% YoY revenue growth. Although still delivering a $33 million net loss, SoundHound ended the quarter with $226 million net cash. Year-to-date, SOUN stock is up 147% at present $5.14 per share. Nasdaq’s average SOUN price target is $7.17 per share.



Baidu (NASDAQ: BIDU as ADS)



Before US export controls on AI chips, Chinese Baidu was a major source of revenue for Nvidia. The company is still a major AI player since shifting to Huawei’s 910B Ascend and its own Kunlun chips. 



Both Baidu and Alibaba recently cut prices on their large-language model as the AI cloud-compute wars heat up in China. In a bid to corner the market, Baidu’s Ernie Speed and Ernie Lite LLMs are now free for business accounts. 



The company’s income stream is stable owing to ad revenue and subscription services like Netflix. In May, for Q1 2024, Baidu reported 7% net income growth and 25% YoY growth for its Apollo Go, an autonomous ride-hailing service. 



Year-to-date, BIDU has tracked a negative 10% performance at $103.50 per share price. Given Nasdaq’s forecasted average BIDU price target of $155.06 per share, this makes for a very strong upswing potential.





Arm Holdings (NASDAQ: ARM as ADS)



In a different timeline, this British semiconductor company would operate under Nvidia. But after failing to acquire Arm for $40 billion in 2020, Nvidia settled for a minor $147.3 million stake. Arm is a highly attractive asset, considering its over 90% market share in the mobile applications market.



Rather than manufacturing chips, Arm relies on design licensing for its revenue. According to a Nikkei report, the company is set to launch AI chips by spring 2025, contracting with various manufacturers for mass production. This will be a boon to suppliers looking to wean off of Nvidia.



ARM stock is up 65% year-to-date. Wall Street Journal’s aggregated forecast puts the average ARM price target at $118.81 vs. the current $114.30 per share, with a high potential of $195.



Nano-X Imaging (NASDAQ: NNOX)



Nvidia’s stake in this startup of $380k was a leftover from Nano-X acquiring Zebra Medical, which Nvidia invested in 2017. Nonetheless, Nano-X got into the public spotlight aiming to reduce healthcare costs with AI solutions.



Specifically, to leverage Digital Tomosynthesis imaging tech to break the barrier for complex and expensive scanning and diagnosis. Combined with Nanox.ARC, the company’s ecosystem to make it happen, is facilitated by Nanox.AI and Nanox.Cloud. 



Nano-X is scheduled to release its Q1 2024 report on May 28th. Previously, the company reported $10.2 million net loss, which was a significant reduction from $52.8 million net loss in a year-ago quarter. Year-to-date, NNOX stock is up 40%. Nasdaq’s average NNOX price target is $16 vs current $9 per share. 







Mobileye Global (NASDAQ: MBLY)



Mobileye’s claim to fame is its camera sensor, which facilitates ADAS (Advanced Driving Assistance Systems) technology. The company’s latest iteration is Mobileye EYEQ6 Lite, which collaborates closely with the Volkswagen Group. 



The Israel-based company directly competes with Nvidia, having noted in 2019 that “Nvidia must think very highly of us,” referring to Nvidia’s Safety Force Field (SFF). Mobileye CEO construed Nvidia’s document as heavily influenced by Mobileye’s own Responsibility-Sensitive Safety (RSS) published in 2017.



In April, Mobileye delivered Q1 earnings, showing a 48% YoY revenue decline and a $218 million net loss vs. a $79 million net loss in the year-ago quarter. However, Mobileye CEO Amnon Shashua is still optimistic, forecasting fully autonomous vehicles hitting the roads in 2026.



With its heavy presence in Israel, investors should note that Intel (INTC) also has a stake in Mobileye. As of February, Intel CEO Gelsinger alone owned 66,386 MBLY shares, alongside 456k shares across trusts. Since Intel is one of the main beneficiaries of the CHIPS Act, aiming to become the world’s second-largest chipmaker after TSMC, long-term Mobileye investments are likely.



Year-to-date, MBLY shares are down 33%. At $27.66, Nasdaq’s average MBLY price target of $38 per share creates a high profit potential. The upper forecasting ceiling for MBLY stock twelve months ahead is $53 per share.

For Immediate ReleaseChicago, IL – May 22, 2024 – Today, Zacks Investment Ideas feature highlights Coinbase, Robinhood Markets, Reddit, GameStop and MicroStrategy.3 Crypto-Related Stocks to Buy NowCoinbaseCoinbase COIN is the most prominent crypto exchange in the U.S., earning a best-possible Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) score.Cash CowSeth Klarman is a legendary value investor, billionaire, and one of the highest-earning money managers in the world. In an interview last year, Klarman stated that he avoids crypto but sees value in Coinbase, saying, "Coinbase is sitting on $5 billion in cash, has less than that in debt, and is doing some smart things." Well, now that number has grown to more than 7 billion. I bring this to your attention because not many people trading a stock like COIN probably understand how sound the company is fundamentally.Coinbase Smashing the Street's ExpectationsOn May 3rd, the leading crypto exchange announced EPS of $4.4, smashing the Street's estimate of $1.07.Here is a snippet of the EPS transcript that stuck out to me:"Our financial performance in Q1 reflects our focused execution on product expansion, ongoing operational discipline, and strong crypto market conditions. We generated $1.6 billion of total revenue and $1.2 billion of net income*. Adjusted EBITDA was $1.0 billion – more than we generated in all of 2023." Lastly, we continue to drive regulatory clarity for crypto through grassroots advocacy, pushing for legislation, and ongoing efforts to seek clarity through the courts." COIN has beaten expectations for five straight quarters, and not only are they beating them, they are smashing them. Over the past five quarters the average EPS surprise is 364.63%!Robinhood MarketsZacks Rank #2 (Buy) stock. Robinhood HOOD is one of the most popular brokerages in the United States. Robinhood was the first major broker to "democratize" trading by offering a commission-free investing app. The app rose to prominence during the meme stock craze that was spurred on by retail investing groups on the social media platform Reddit RDDT and included meteoric moves in stocks like GameStop GME.Bull Catalyst: CryptoHOOD recently added crypto-enabled trading. Though HOOD is late to the crypto game, the company has the perfect client base to take advantage of a Bitcoin BTC/USD bull market.Consistent Positive EPS SurprisesHOOD reported first-quarter earnings that trounced Zacks Consensus Estimates by 260%. Over the past four quarters, positive earnings beats have become the norm, with an average EPS beat of 230%!Record Net DepositsNet deposits are one of the most important metrics to monitor for brokers. HOOD net deposits reached a record $11.2 billion in Q1, translating to a 44% annualized growth rate and contributing to a 30% growth rate over the last twelve months. Meanwhile, CEO Vlad Tenev announced on May 14th that Robinhood hit $5B in equities trading volume.Robinhood Gold Is GrowingRobinhood recently announced a new "Gold" credit card.

Instead of sitting in inflationary assets like U.S. dollars, Saylor realized MSTR would be better off on a "Bitcoin sail." Essentially, MSTR is a leveraged Bitcoin bet. The results speak for themselves – over the past five years, MicroStrategy is up more than 1,000%!Conversely, a good option for investors who do not want a leveraged bet but want to tap into Bitcoin's potential upside is the IBIT ETF IBIT.

Florida court reinstates Binance US money services license - CoinJournal



                    

                    
Binance US wins appeal to reinstate its Florida money-services business license.
Court ruled OFR lacked legal justification for the emergency suspension order.
Binance US suspension posed financial risks to over 170,000 Florida account holders.

Binance US has successfully appealed the suspension of its money-services business license in Florida.
The Florida First District Court of Appeal ruled that the emergency suspension order issued by the state Office of Financial Regulation (OFR) lacked sufficient legal justification.
Binance US suspension was unjustified
The suspension, initiated following Binance CEO Changpeng Zhao’s guilty plea on November 21, 2023, to federal charges of violating U.S. Anti-Money Laundering laws, was deemed unjustified by the court.
The court noted that the relevant state law uses the term “may,” indicating discretion rather than a mandatory action, for suspending a license.
In its ruling the court has said that it requires the OFR to provide additional reasoning beyond merely citing the statute and to explore less severe alternatives to outright suspension.
The court’s decision further emphasized that the suspension posed significant financial risks to over 170,000 Florida account holders.
The court stated, “For Petitioner to immediately comply with the ESO, it would be necessary to liquidate the digital asset holdings of every customer [which] threatens financial harm because of digital asset price fluctuations.”
Binance US resumes operations in Florida
The suspension in Florida was one of the first among several states following Zhao’s plea, with similar actions in Alaska, Maine, North Carolina, and Oregon.
In addition, the status of Binance US’s operations remains uncertain in Georgia and Ohio, while it has never operated in Hawaii, Minnesota, New York, Texas, and Vermont.
Although the ruling is subject to appeal, Binance US can resume its operations in Florida for now.
The crypto exchange has, however, temporarily paused new user onboarding in Florida while continuing to serve its existing customers in the state.

Grabby Trump (GRATRUMP) to Skyrocket 14,000% as KuCoin Listing Announced, While Shiba Inu and Dogecoin Struggle



                    

Grabby Trump (GRATRUMP) could turn early investors into multi-millionaires if it becomes a mainstream coin, like Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE).



Grabby Trump (GRATRUMP), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is poised to explode over 14,000% in price in the coming days.




This is because GRATRUMP has announced its first centralized exchange listing, which will be on KuCoin.



This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up.



Currently, Grabby Trump can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jupiter and Raydium, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days.



Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Grabby Trump could become the next viral memecoin.



Grabby Trump launched with over $6,000 of locked liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains.



To buy Grabby Trump on Raydium or Jupiter ahead of the KuCoin listing, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Grabby Trump by entering its contract address – 84ABvkFYWuh5oCSvPMztyeK5yVQAsd17egSLgJN4X9nr – in the receiving field.



In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price.




If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner.



The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum.




This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like GRATRUMP.

BREAKING: Highly Anticipated FED Minutes Released - Here Are The Most Important Details - Bitcoin Sistemi


Investors were expecting to hear more details today about what led Federal Reserve officials to advance plans to slow the pace of balance sheet reduction even as the central bank keeps its benchmark interest rate steady.
Here are the highlights from the minutes of the April 30-May 1 meeting, where interest rates were kept constant:



'Many' respondents were uncertain about the degree to which the policy would be restricted.
'Various' participants are willing to tighten further if necessary.
Respondents assessed that it would take longer than previously anticipated to gain greater confidence that inflation would move sustainably towards 2%.
Several participants said it would be helpful to begin discussions about the appropriate term structure of the Fed's portfolio over the long term.
Nearly all respondents supported the Fed's decision to begin slowing the pace of decline in securities holdings; a few supported continuing the current pace.
Officials are discussing keeping interest rates steady for longer if inflation does not fall.
FED officials drew attention to the 'disappointing' inflation figures in the first quarter.
'Various' Fed officials have talked about raising interest rates if inflation warrants it.
Participants noted that the future policy path will depend on incoming data, the evolving outlook and the balance of risks.
Many participants expressed uncertainty regarding the degree of policy restrictiveness.
Several participants spoke of a willingness to tighten policy further if the risks to the outlook materialize and make such action appropriate.
Some officials think long-term interest rates may be higher than previously thought.
Some officials worry that financial conditions are not restrictive enough.
Although the economic forecast of the FED staff is similar to the March outlook, it was stated that the deterioration in the financial positions of low-income households, in particular, could pose a greater obstacle to economic activity than anticipated.

While FED officials decided to keep the federal interest rate target at 5.2-5.50%, Powell stated that the current stance is appropriately restrictive and maintains maximum flexibility and optionality.

However, Citi's Andrew Hollenhorst argued that the economic data released so far this month, including the consumer price index, which points to a welcome slowdown in inflation, and the latest comments from FED speakers make the minutes “stale” at this point.





“The slowdown in employment growth and significant declines in individual sales and industrial production since the May 1 FOMC meeting will further convince officials that growth is slowing,” Hollenhorst wrote.

Whale Withdraws Over Half a Trillion PEPE Worth Nearly $8,000,000 From Binance As Memecoin Soars - The Daily Hodl


								A deep-pocketed crypto entity has been seen suddenly withdrawing more than a half trillion Pepe (PEPE) as the memecoin soars, on-chain data shows.
Blockchain tracking firm Lookonchain noticed that the crypto whale withdrew 592 billion PEPE from Binance, the world’s top crypto exchange, which was worth nearly $8 million at the time of the transaction.










“A whale withdrew 592 billion PEPE ($7.95 million) from Binance [on May 22nd], most likely bought during the price increase over the past two days.”
Source: Lookonchain/X
Pepe is trading for $0.0000137 at time of writing, up 11.5% in the past 24 hours and 108% in the last month.
Some analysts are suddenly turning bullish on Pepe, including pseudonymous crypto analyst Altcoin Sherpa.
 “If you’re looking for a big cap meme to long, I think PEPE is a good one, good liquidity, strong volume. This one definitely catches up to the others a bit in my opinion – not saying it’ll flip Doge or anything, but should go up more relatively. Long in the green boxes.”
Source: Altcoin Sherpa/X
Looking at his chart, the analyst suggests Pepe could retest two trading ranges to the downside, including the range between $0.00001300 to $0.00001200 and $0.00001150 to $0.00001100, before rallying again.
However, another popular analyst DonAlt is warning that red-hot memes like Pepe could see a sudden collapse in value of more than 80% based on data from previous cycles.
“If I’m right, the popular memes we trade today will trade 80%+ lower. Then you’ll have new memes come up that build new communities that run up. And we’ll have the same discussions in a couple of years.”

Biden Campaign Pleads For Donations To Compete With Crypto Execs Supporting Trump

                        President Joe Biden’s election campaign team is calling for financial aid to keep up with his Republican, competition, who he says is backed by the wealthy crypto industry.Biden Begs For Support To Fight Crypto
In a widely circulated screenshot on Wednesday, Biden’s campaign team appeared to have messaged followers warning them of the sheer size of donations being received by the Trump campaign.“Folks, this couldn’t be any more serious,” Biden’s message reads. “Cryptocurrency executives and oil barrons are coming out of the woodwork for Trump. They’re rushing $800,000 checks at glitzy events.”Biden admitted that Trump’s campaign was outraising his own, pulling $76 million in April, with $50 million raised purely from the former President’s $50 million Florida gala last month.Biden’s request mimics those of democratic senator Elizabeth Warren months prior, who is now in direct competition with a Republican pro-crypto lawyer for her seat in Massachusets.Figures from the Federal Election Commission last month showed that John Deaton – who represented 75,000 XRP investors in a lawsuit with federal regulators last year – raised $1.36 million in Q1, compared to Warren’s $1.1 million. Some of Deaton’s donors included Skybridge Capital co-founder Anthony Scaramucci and Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse, among others.Crypto’s Partisan Nature
Crypto’s lopsided support for Republicans follows years of hostile enforcement actions against the industry from the Democrat-led Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), and direct efforts from the White House to hamper the Bitcoin mining industry.Earlier this month, the White House promised to veto legislation that would repeal SAB 121 – an SEC rule widely criticized for preventing regulated banks from offering crypto custody services.Both the House and Senate have now passed the resolutions, with total Republican support alongside small Democrat support in both chambers.Meanwhile, Donald Trump – who once derided Bitcoin as a scam – is now warming up to the industry. After a February interview saying he would be tolerant of Bitcoin, the candidate has now begun accepting crypto-based campaign donations, with intentions to build a “crypto army” challenging Elizabeth Warren’s hostile efforts.An official filing in October 2023 showed that Trump personally owned between $250,000 and $500,000 in crypto.Later today, the House of Representatives will vote on the Financial Innovation and Technology for the 21st Century Act (FIT21), which is intended to foster broad regulatory clarity for crypto at large.

Bitcoin Bulls Are Strong: Over 450,000 Addresses Bought 273,000 BTC At This Level


																Bitcoin is cooling off after an impressive 25% spike from May 2024 lows. Even with this cool-off, some analysts are upbeat, predicting the coin will extend gains in future sessions.
Bitcoin Finds Strong Support Between $70,180 and $70,600
In a post on X, one analyst believes Bitcoin has strong support at around $70,180 and $70,600. The analyst explained that on-chain data shows that over 450,000 addresses collectively bought over 273,000 BTC at this price range.

For this reason, the concentration of BTC holdings in this zone means the coin has strong support. If the level is to be broken, then sellers would need to make an even larger effort to break through this line, with a higher amount of BTC hitting the sell side of the equation.

On-chain analytics firm Glassnode notes that the Bitcoin market is cooling after intense selling pressure. After the strong uptick that saw the coin roar to as high as $73,800 in March 2024, prices plunged to as low as $56,500 this month. Prices have since recovered, but bulls have yet to break above all-time highs.
While capital inflows remain moderate, Glassnode adds, volatility has decreased noticeably. Still, whether this volatility will shoot higher once $72,000 is broken remains to be seen.
BTC Retraces: Will Bulls Break $72,000?
 
All eyes are on whether BTC bulls will shake off the current correction. In a post on X, another analyst said holders shouldn’t be worried because of this pullback and the failure of bulls to confirm the May 20 leg up.
Pullbacks are inevitable in bull markets | Source: @CryptoJelleNL via X
Instead, the analyst is confident, saying pullbacks are a natural part of any bull market. The recent 23% correction, the analyst added, is an example. 
What’s important is that every retracement has been from a higher position. Therefore, the next local bottom will likely be higher than the previous one, potentially reaching around $80,000.

Thus far, BTC has a strong resistance of $72,000. The bulls didn’t push through this line, even with more serious attempts in early April. 
As a result, this reaction level remains important from a technical perspective. Any breakout for now would increase the probability of BTC prices floating to retest $73,800 or break higher.

In the days ahead, inflows to spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) coupled with improving sentiment might spark more demand. In that likelihood, BTC bulls will find the momentum to confirm the May 20 bar and break above the local resistance.

Solana & Bitcoin Sentiment Still Bearish: Signal To Buy?


								Data suggests the market sentiment around Solana (SOL) and Bitcoin (BTC) is negative currently, something that could benefit their prices.
Crowd Bearish About Solana & Bitcoin While Ethereum Gets All The Hype
As explained by the on-chain analytics firm Santiment in a post on X, investors have still not become bullish about Bitcoin and Solana despite their recent surge.
The relevant indicator here is the “Weighted Sentiment,” which is based on two other metrics: Sentiment Balance and Social Volume. The former measures the net sentiment among cryptocurrency traders right now.

This indicator works by analyzing social media data and applying a machine learning model to differentiate between negative and positive posts about the asset. Then, it uses the difference between the two to determine which side is currently dominant.
The second metric of interest here, Social Volume, tracks the unique number of posts/messages/threads on social media platforms discussing a given asset. Essentially, its value represents the degree of discussion the coin receives from social media users.
While the Sentiment Balance does provide information about the net sentiment in the market, it’s not always useful, as it doesn’t say anything about how many users actually share this opinion.
The Weighted Sentiment fixes this problem by weighing the Sentiment Balance against the Social Volume. This means that this indicator’s value only spikes in either direction when many posts discuss the asset, and most of them are positive or negative about the coin.
Here is a chart showing the trend in the Weighted Sentiment for three of the top cryptocurrencies in the sector: Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Solana.

The value of the metric appears to have been quite positive for ETH recently | Source: Santiment on X
As displayed in the above graph, the Weighted Sentiment for Bitcoin and Solana has been negative recently. Interestingly, these red levels have persisted despite their prices observed bullish winds.
Ethereum, on the other hand, has seen a large positive spike in the indicator, implying that many bullish posts related to the coin are spreading on social media.
This optimism behind the cryptocurrency is due to positive news about the odds of the ETH spot exchange-traded funds (ETFs) being approved.

Historically, market euphoria has been a bearish sign, as the price generally tends to move opposite to the majority’s expectations. Similarly, investors’ fear has been a positive sign that fresh surges will start.
As such, at least going by the sentiment, Bitcoin and Solana may be more likely to see a rise than Ethereum, which may be getting too hot.
SOL Price
With gains of more than 19% over the past week, Solana is among the best performers out of the top coins by market cap. At present, SOL’s price is trading around $177.

                        Wednesday, 22 May 2024 – Learn-to-Earn token 99Bitcoins ($99BTC) has raised $1.5 million from contributors to its presale as interest in its pioneering protocol grows.99Bitcoins is one of the most well-known and earliest of the Bitcoin education sites and is a respected resource for all those who wish to find out more about bitcoin and crypto more broadly.There are just five days to go before the token presale price increases from $0.00106 to $0.00107, so there’s no time to lose to catch the lowest bid.As Bitcoin hovers around the $70,000 mark a renewed push to all-time highs above $74,00,000 is on the cards, and that will keep 99Bitcoins’ presale firmly in the spotlight.Ethereum ETF approval will further drive up interest in crypto and 99Bitcoins token
Bitcoin has entered the financial mainstream following the approval of Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs), which provide a regulated, cheap and easy entry point for investing in the preeminent digital asset.Since then, the possibility that an Ethereum ETF could be next up for approval has led to a resurgence in crypto prices, with Bitcoin and Ethereum leading the way.This is all good news for top crypto education and information sites like 99Bitcoins.Bloomberg Intelligence analysts have changed the probability of an Ethereum ETF being approved from 10% to 75%, after the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) asked providers to expedite submission of paperwork (19-b4s forms to be precise) that are seen as a precursor to an approval.Tomorrow, 23 May, the first provider to have its Ethereum ETF up for consideration by the SEC is VanEck Ethereum ETF.Although it is not certain that positive news will emerge tomorrow, all the signs are pointing to an approval, albeit the exact date may be several weeks away.The SEC is thought to be likely to approve all the submitted ETFs at the same time, as it did with the Bitcoin ETFs, in order to not give any one provider an advantage over its competitors.There are a total of 10 Ethereum ETFs seeking approval or conversion in the case of the Grayscale Ethereum Trust.This news flow combined with the bitcoin halving event that typically ushers in a bullish pricing environment for crypto, means the 99Bitcoins presale is set to rocket.Helping $99BTC to stand out from the crowd is its strong protocol fundamentals, connected as it is to the mounting interest in the crypto space.99Bitcoins ($99BTC) is presenting to the market a revamped educational platform that monetizes education with a Learn-to-Earn rewards model that is uniquely well-positioned for success.There’s no telling how much value can be placed on trust, and 99Bitcoins has that enviable commodity by the bucket load.It means the platform will be able to capture a significant chunk of new entrants to the crypto space looking for best-in-class educational resources they can rely on.99Bitcoins’ early emphasis on the visual learner through its YouTube channel will also stand it in good stead with crypto beginners, where its new visual courses are sure to be a hit.No business or website can rest on its laurels, but where 99Bitcoins is concerned, its pedigree heritage platform gives it a competitive advantage as an educator and resource provider.Its YouTube channel has 700,000 subscribers and the crypto courses already have more than two million registered users.This is how 99Bitcoins’ token works to incentivize learning
99Bitcoins combines gamification with a leaderboard reward system to incentivize users to keep learning. The concept is simplicity itself: users earn crypto while learning about crypto.Interactive learning modules, quizzes, and tutorials are all designed with gamification in mind.User progression is reinforced through the unlocking of more courses, which means more opportunities to earn rewards – at the core of the system is the $99BTC token to make learning engaging, enjoyable and profitable for all users.The emphasis on multimedia taps into the reality that people find it easier and less daunting to learn when they have audio and visual aids, instead of being expected to wade through a textbook.Building on its current offering, the courses will cover everything from the ins and outs of blockchains to crypto wallet basics, how-to guides all the way through to trading signals, strategies, and high-end technical knowledge.$99BTC token has a lot going for it in the utility stakes, which is why some crypto experts think it could be a top bet for the next 10x crypto:VIDEOWhere it all began for 99Bitcoins… and where it is headed with BRC20 tokens
The roots of 99Bitcoins go back to 2013, two years before Ethereum even existed and around the same time Bitcoin achieved some mainstream awareness.Always an evangelist for financial freedom and an eye for getting people into the space, 99Bitcoins began life as BitcoinWithPayPal.com.The website said what it does on the tin.But including another company in the brand name didn’t go down too well with PayPal, so the 99Bitcoins brand was born.Being a trailblazer remains in the DNA of the website, which is why it is now pivoting to Web3 with its groundbreaking Learn-to-Earn ecosystem.Although $99BTC initially launches as an ERC-20 token, it will transition to BRC-20, the new Bitcoin Ordinals standard.Ordinals use spare ‘inscriptions’ space provided in the Bitcoin protocol to store the code for fungible tokens. The innovation first began as a way to create non-fungible tokens (NFTs) on the Bitcoin blockchain.Among the new projects being built on the Bitcoin blockchain are the ORDI and SATS tokens, up 6.7% and 9% respectively over the past seven days.Therefore, 99Bitcoins is launching at an opportune time, as judged by the current market sentiment and the targeting of the expected continued growth in this exciting new area of Bitcoin development.The market value (market capitalization) of BRC-20 tokens is today a little shy of a whopping $2 billion.99Bitcoins is giving away $99,999 in BTC to early presale buyers
In addition to the presale opportunity, 99Bitcoins is also running a $99,999 airdrop of Bitcoin (BTC). This will be exclusively for early supporters who follow the instructions on the presale section of the official website.In the $9,999 giveaway the project is rewarding 99 participants from a total giveaway pot of $99,999 worth of Bitcoin. Eligibility is secured by following, retweeting, or signing up on the website.99Bitcoins is continuing its legacy of making Bitcoin and crypto work for ordinary people.Through education, helpful resources and now an incentivized Web3 learning platform, 99Bitcoins will help newbies onboard and grow their experience in the crypto world, and earn rewards while they are doing so – that’s a killer combo as crypto goes mainstream.Visit the presale website at presale.99bitcoins.com (beware of imitators).

Waiting for Ethereum Spot ETFs Continues: Top 10 Developer-Focused Altcoins Likely to Be Impacted Upon Approval Revealed - Bitcoin Sistemi


While there are strong expectations that Ethereum Spot ETFs will be approved by the SEC, the Ethereum ecosystem altcoins that cryptocurrency developers are most focused on have emerged.
With the approval of Ethereum Spot ETFs, it is thought that other ETH ecosystem altcoins may also be affected by this event.


Here are the ETH ecosystem altcoins and developer scores that cryptocurrency developers have focused on the most in the last 30 days:

Chainlink (LINK) – 479.77
Status (SNT) – 307.1
Ethereum (ETH) – 304.17
Decentraland (MANA) – 258.63
Audius (AUDIO) – 211.33
sUSD (SUSD) – 185.07
Synthetix (SNX) – 185.07
Holo (HOT) – 146.9
API3 (API3) – 131.03
The Graph (GRT) – 123.37

All of these mentioned altcoins have the ERC20 standard.






However, Ethereum spot ETFs have not yet been approved, and altcoins in this ecosystem may react widely to approval or rejection. However, according to information obtained by various cryptocurrency journalists from sources, some of them originating from the SEC, these ETFs seem likely to be approved.
On the other hand, the fact that these ETFs will not have staking features causes some analysts to list them among the factors that may reduce the demand for these ETFs.

SEC's Gensler criticizes crypto regulation bill ahead of vote


SEC Chair Gary Gensler opposed the Financial Innovation and Technology for the 21st Century Act (FIT21) in a statement on Wednesday.



The bill, which has garnered support from key Republicans and major cryptocurrency firms, is scheduled for a vote in the House of Representatives, with its future in the Senate remaining uncertain.



Gensler’s critique centers on the risk that the bill could undermine the SEC’s ability to protect investors and the integrity of U.S. capital markets by altering the classification of crypto assets and diminishing regulatory oversight.



“[FIT 21] would create new regulatory gaps and undermine decades of precedent regarding the oversight of investment contracts, putting investors and capital markets at immeasurable risk,” Gensler said.

	
	
	
	


The FIT21 Act, introduced in July 2023, seeks to establish clear federal guidelines for digital asset markets and delineate the roles of the SEC and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) in cryptocurrency regulation. 



Gensler said that the bill could erode the Howey test, a cornerstone in determining investment contracts, and allow crypto firms to circumvent SEC regulation by self-certifying their products as “decentralized” digital commodities.



Additionally, the FIT21 Act’s exclusion of crypto trading platforms from the definition of an exchange is seen by Gensler as a move that could undermine investor protection. 



The White House also released a statement on Wednesday that opposes the passage of the bill.

	
	
	

	


“H.R. 4763 in its current form lacks sufficient protections for consumers and investors who engage in certain digital asset transactions,” the President’s Executive Office said on Wednesday.

Ethereum Game 'Pixelmon' Reveals MON Token Airdrop Details - Decrypt

Pokémon-esque crypto and NFT game Pixelmon has announced airdrop details for its soon-to-be-launched MON token.Over 180,000 wallets will be eligible for the airdrop on Monday, May 27 with the claim process starting at 9:30 a.m. UTC through the newly created Mon Protocol. MON will be minted as an ERC-20 token on Ethereum.Those eligible include holders of selected Pixelmon game NFTs, players of Pixelmon hyper-casual game Kevin the Adventurer, participants in the PixelPals “Farm2Farm” competition, and buyers of the MON token presale. Pixelmon originally launched with clunky Minecraft-like artwork which led to the battle arena title being widely ridiculed online. Now two years, an ownership change, and a dramatic artwork overhaul later, the Pixelmon IP is birthing quarterly mini-game releases with larger-scale games further on the horizon.This included Kevin the Adventurer, which was built around a heavily memed ogre-like creature from the Pixelmon universe, soon garnering 36,000 active players on Base. And then PixelPals was launched on the Mantle network, blending pet care and trading card elements. Both player bases are being rewarded during this airdrop.One group that won’t be receiving their MON tokens during the token generation event are those who completed Mon Protocol airdrop missions. These players will get their tokens shortly after the event has finished, as originally planned.Alongside the launch and airdrop of the MON token, a staking platform will also go live. Token stakers will accumulate points that can be spent in a launch pool, more details about this will be announced “soon” after the token launches, but the basic gist with most staking programs is that holders can earn rewards for locking them up within the game or platform.LiquidX bought the Pixelmon IP from the original creators in 2022, setting out to expand the initially ridiculed brand of Pixelmon into trading cards, merchandise, and various media adaptations using the Mon Protocol to power this growth.The MON token is designed to fuel what’s been described as an “IP protocol” to incentivize and reward NFT holders who help grow the Pixelmon brand as it expands with larger games in the future.Edited by Andrew HaywardGG NewsletterGet the latest web3 gaming news, hear directly from gaming studios and influencers covering the space, and receive power-ups from our partners.

Gensler & Biden Speak Out Against FIT21 Act | Bankless


SEC Chair Gary Gensler says he strongly opposes the Financial Innovation and Technology for the 21st Century Act (FIT21), citing major concerns about investor protection and market integrity. President Biden has also signaled opposition but stopped short of threatening a veto.What’s the Scoop?Regulatory Concerns: Gensler opposes FIT21, arguing it undermines decades of securities regulation.Investor Risks: He claims FIT21 would allow crypto firms to self-certify as "decentralized," putting them outside the SEC's oversight and risking investor protection.State of Legislative Support: Major crypto groups and presumptive GOP presidential candidate Donald Trump support FIT21 as a necessary modernization of outdated securities laws. The U.S. House of Representatives plans to vote on FIT21 soon, and even House Speaker Nancy Pelosi is considering the bill. Biden Opposition: While the White House opposes the bill over concerns about investor protections, it is not threatening a veto. This shows they are open to working with Congress on future bipartisan legislation.
Bankless TakeGary Gensler's opposition to the FIT21 Act is expected but disappointing, particularly considering the bipartisan history of the bill. As Republicans lead the vote in our industry, it would be wise for Democrats to come around and reassess the issue of crypto with fresh eyes as the election approaches. Many speculate this may be the reason for the ETH ETF’s likely approval, with the White House’s stance now potentially reinforcing this view. A good thing too as proponents of FIT21, like Stand With Crypto, make it clear that crypto support spans the political spectrum, especially among Gen Z.In the end, Gary’s stance just increases the importance of voicing your support for the bill.Tell Your Representative to Support FIT21 on BanklessHelp DC pass crypto legislation that makes sense.Click here to find your representative and ask them to vote YES on the FIT21 Act.

Experts speak out on how high Ethereum could go with an ETF approval - Crypto Briefing


            
            
                            
            
                            
            
            Tomorrow is the final deadline for the approval of VanEck’s spot Ethereum exchange-traded fund (ETF) in the US, and expectations are high. Bloomberg ETF analyst James Seyffart shared that an approval movement “is happening,” despite regulatory indicators pointing out to the contrary direction until Monday.As a result, Ethereum (ETH) leaped up to 21% in less than 48 hours and stood just 22% from its all-time high of $4,878.26, according to data aggregator CoinGecko. Bitcoin (BTC) leaped 96% in two months before the approval of the first spot Bitcoin ETFs in the US and reached its all-time high two months later.James Davies, co-founder and CPO at Crypto Valley Exchange, highlights that Bitcoin’s case was different. “In that instance, though, everything came together – ETFs, bitcoin halving, and global inflation easing significantly – and lined up to drive Bitcoin. Ethereum has already had the crypto cycle and global market sentiment increase,” he shares.Although Davies sees Ethereum ETF inflows having a substantial impact, propelling ETH to new all-time highs, it may be hard for Ethereum to replicate BTC’s movement after the funds’ approval. “It does, however, present a great steady growth story for the rest of 2024.”Ruslan Lienkha, chief of markets at YouHodler, also shares the view that an Ethereum ETF might trigger a sharp ETH price increase. Moreover, this movement might not be fully priced, with significant upside yet to be seen. “If so, it will be a powerful impetus for the whole crypto market and a stimulus for other coins’ growth,” added Lienkha.Bitfinex’s analysts believe that a spot Ethereum ETF approval could play out just like the spot Bitcoin ETF approval, which was “a sell-the-news event before a long-term bullish outlook was triggered, causing a multi-month rally.” As for inflows, they expect a similar level compatible with ETH’s market cap.The current move from sub $3000 to $3800 is a result of the market pricing in the higher odds of an ETF approval. It is important that market participants often front-run and price in odds as absolute – implying that 75% odds of approval by Bloomberg analysts could potentially be priced in as 100%.Marko Jurina CEO at Jumper.Exchange, pointed out that BTC rose nearly 65% following the trading of spot Bitcoin ETFs in the US. Thus, a similar movement would propel ETH “well beyond its previous all-time high.” Zentner also believes that the approval might trigger a crypto market growth for the second half of 2024.What if…?Despite the optimism regarding the Ethereum ETF approval, there is still a slight chance of rejection. Moreover, as highlighted by Seyffart, a good part of investors are misunderstanding the current movement since approval doesn’t translate to immediate trading. Both of these scenarios might then upset investors.Nevertheless, in the light of recent developments, those events are now being priced out, says James Davies, from Crypto Valley Exchange. On the other hand, Jumper.Exchange’s Marko Jurina believes that both negative possible events are already priced in.“When the spot BTC ETFs first came to market, there was actually a brief sell-off where some took profits before the rally resumed. Additionally, given the volatile nature of the market, good and bad news gives ample opportunity for market makers to create more violent price swings, so blood on the streets is definitely possible. More problematic for the ETH community (if no approval) would be the loss of a narrative as a catalyst,” Jurina added.Moreover, a slight drop followed by a consolidation period is also a possibility, shares Ruslan Lienkha from YouHodler. “Ethereum ETF approval is just a matter of time. The SEC will approve it sooner or later after the status clarification of ETH, and it matters little if it is recognized as a commodity, security, or something else. As for now, fundamentally, nothing will change for ETH. It will remain the second crypto in the industry even without ETFs.”Even if an unlikely rejection happens, Bitfinex analysts describe a ‘layered’ scenario, which could end in a “hard rejection” or a “soft rejection.” A hard rejection would include ETH being considered a security, while a soft rejection would be limited to ETF proposals.“The former could be very bearish leading to a retrace of the entire move up currently. The latter could lead to more speculation continuing over a future approval on re-appeal,” Bitfinex analysts concluded.

                        President Joe Biden’s administration will oppose the passage of Financial Innovation and Technology for the 21st Century Act (FIT21) amidst its vote in the House of Representatives, a Wednesday statement from the White House claims.President Joe Biden To Oppose FIT21 Amid Vote
The White House statement says that FIT21 “lacks sufficient protections for consumers and investors who engage in certain digital asset transactions,” but stops short of vetoing the legislation altogether.“The Administration is eager to work with Congress to ensure a comprehensive and balanced regulatory framework for digital assets, building on existing authorities, which will promote the responsible development of digital assets and payment innovation and help reinforce United States leadership in the global financial system,” the statement continues.The Biden administration’s statement comes just as the House of Representatives are scheduled to vote on whether or not to advance the key piece of crypto regulation widely supported by the blockchain sector.If passed, FIT21 would allot greater freedoms to U.S. crypto operators and delegate increased regulatory responsibility of digital assets towards the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC).Meanwhile, critics argue that the passage of FIT21 could cause market instability and negate already established securities law.SEC Chair Gary Gensler Pushes Back On Crypto Regulation Bill
On Wednesday morning, United States Securities and Exchange Commission Chair Gary Gensler released his own statement criticizing the bill, claiming it would put “investors and capital markets at immeasurable risk.”“The crypto industry’s record of failures, frauds, and bankruptcies is not because we don’t have rules or because the rules are unclear,” Gensler wrote. “It’s because many players in the crypto industry don’t play by the rules.”Both Gensler and the Biden administration have been criticized for their stringent regulatory-focused approach to digital assets, with the SEC filing litigation against several major crypto organizations in the past several years alone.However, new momentum around a handful of crypto-related legislation on Capitol Hill could spell the beginning of the end for the SEC’s regulation-by-enforcement approach altogether.Just last week, both chambers of Congress passed a bipartisan resolution that would overturn the federal agency’s controversial staff accounting bulletin SAB121, despite Biden having released a statement saying he would veto it.Meanwhile, Republican presidential frontrunner Donald Trump announced has seemingly embraced cryptocurrency, with his campaign beginning to accept donations in crypto as of Tuesday.Alexander Grieve, Paradigm’s lead on government affairs, noted a shift in the White House’s tone towards digital assets between the Biden administration’s recent veto announcement and Wednesday’s statement on FIT21, calling it “a huge course correction.”Despite U.S. lawmakers’ efforts, only time will tell whether or not common-sense crypto regulation will be passed anytime soon.

Ethereum Futures ETFs Hit Record Daily Trading Volume Amid Anticipation of Spot Approvals

                        The daily trading volume for Ethereum futures exchange-traded funds (ETFs) surged to an all-time high yesterday, fueled by increasing anticipation of potential spot approval from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).On Tuesday, Ethereum futures ETFs recorded a trading volume of $47.75 million, a 40% increase from the previous peak of $34.18 million set on March 5, when Ether was nearing the $4,000 mark. This build-up followed a significant spike of $23.67 million on Monday.New Records From All Corners
ProShares’ Ether Strategy ETF (EETH) led the category, accounting for $43.14 million or 90% of yesterday’s trading volume. VanEck’s Ethereum Strategy ETF (EFUT) and Bitwise’s Ethereum Strategy ETF (AETH) followed, generating $2.6 million and $2.01 million, respectively, according to The Block’s dashboard data.Despite this new record, the trading volume for Ethereum futures ETFs, which launched in October 2023, remains modest compared to spot Bitcoin ETFs.The latter debuted in January and amassed a combined trading volume of $2.16 billion on Tuesday, spearheaded by BlackRock’s IBIT with $1.12 billion. However, it is noteworthy that spot Bitcoin ETF daily trading volume has significantly decreased since its peak of $9.93 billion on March 5, coinciding with Bitcoin surpassing its previous cycle high of around $69,000.Grayscale’s Ethereum Trust (ETHE) also saw a substantial rise in trading volume on Tuesday, reaching $684.44 million — the highest since its all-time high of $842.67 million in May 2021. ETHE’s discount to net asset value narrowed to -6.7%, its lowest level in over two years. Investors are purchasing discounted shares in anticipation of a potential ETF conversion, reminiscent of the scenario with Grayscale’s Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) before its conversion to an ETF on January 11.Spot Ethereum ETF Approval Likely Close
The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has recently requested exchanges to update their spot Ethereum exchange-traded fund (ETF) filings by submitting new Form 19b-4 on an “accelerated basis.” This requirement suggests that the SEC might be leaning towards approving the Ethereum ETF applications by the upcoming deadline, potentially leading to the issuance of the second spot digital asset ETF in the U.S. Bloomberg analysts Eric Balchunas and James Seyffart have raised the approval odds from 25% to 75%, while ETF Store president Nate Geraci highlighted the necessity for the SEC to approve both the 19b-4s and S-1s for the ETFs to launch.This possible approval is seen as a significant shift in U.S. crypto policy. Variant Fund Chief Legal Officer Jake Chervinsky noted that such an approval would surprise many in Washington, D.C., and could signal a significant policy shift rather than just the introduction of an ETF.Notably, Standard Chartered also maintains its bullish prediction of $8,000 for Ethereum (ETH) by 2024, driven by the increasing likelihood of Ethereum exchange-traded fund (ETF) approvals. The bank forecasts that these ETFs could launch in the U.S. this week with 80% to 90% confidence, potentially leading to significant inflows of 2.39 to 9.15 million Ether, translating to $15 billion to $45 billion in the first year.The renewed optimism surrounding spot Ethereum ETFs has contributed to a 20% rise in Ether’s price since Monday, driving the price to around $3,792. According to Coinmarketcap, ETH is trading at $3,741 at the time of writing.

Can Polygon [MATIC] climb 17% soon? Taking a closer look - AMBCrypto



MATIC may be due for a double-digit rally, according to analyst Ali Martinez.
However, it might face headwinds in the short term.

Polygon [MATIC] is due for a 17% price rally if it breaks above its parallel channel, crypto analyst Ali Martinez has noted in a post on X (formerly Twitter).
Assessing the L2 token’s movements on a 4-hour chart, Martinez found that its price has consolidated within a range since the beginning of April to form the parallel channel pattern.
This pattern is formed when an asset’s price action is confined between two trend lines, indicating a period of consolidation. 
MATIC may not be ready
At press time, MATIC exchanged hands at $0.72 and trended toward the upper line of its parallel channel.
When an asset rallies toward the upper trendline of a parallel channel, it is interpreted as an attempt to test resistance. 
If that position fails to hold, and a breakout ensues, the asset in question may record new price highs. 
However, AMBCrypto found that MATIC’s rally above this resistance level may be challenging in the short term. 
This is because the token’s price trades significantly close to its 20-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA).
When an asset’s price fluctuates around this moving average, it hints at indecision in the market, with neither buyers nor sellers able to establish dominance. 
For a break above the resistance to occur, there has to be a surge in buying pressure, which puts the bulls in clear market control.
However, with MATIC’s MACD line (blue) gearing to fall below its signal line (orange), bear power might be on the rise. 
When an asset’s MACD line attempts to fall below its signal line, it’s generally interpreted as a bearish signal. It suggests a weakening upward momentum and a shift toward a downtrend. 
Source: MATIC/USDT on TradingView
A good place to buy?
MATIC’s Market Value to Realized Value (MVRV) ratio, assessed using a 365-day moving average, has flashed a buy signal. 
According to Santiment’s data, this metric’s value was -12.58% as of this writing. The metric measures the ratio between MATIC’s current market price and the average price of every token acquired. 
Source: Santiment

Read Polygon’s [MATIC] Price Prediction 2024-2025

When it returns a negative value like this, MATIC is deemed to be undervalued, as its market value is below the average purchase price of all its tokens in circulation. 
It is seen as a buy signal because traders see it as an opportunity to buy the token at a discount compared to the historical cost basis.

Cryptocurrency Journalist Eleanor Terrett Reveals She Heard Something New About Ethereum Spot ETFs - Bitcoin Sistemi


Eleanor Terrett, a famous cryptocurrency journalist, raised the possibility of Ethereum Spot ETFs being approved tomorrow.
Terrett said the following regarding the issue:



“Discussions have begun between SEC staff and issuers regarding S-1s, with the conclusion that there is 'work to be done' on them. I will consult with ETF experts on this, but this suggests the SEC may approve 19b4s tomorrow and then over the next few weeks/months.” “It shows that it will work with issuers on S-1s throughout.”


Bloomberg ETF analyst James Seyffart also made evaluations on the subject. “Yes, I think if they work very hard it can be done in a few weeks, but there are many examples in history of this process taking more than 3 months (of course, the current situation is unlike anything that has ever happened in history, in my opinion),” Seyffart said.
Until a few days ago, almost everyone was commenting on ETH Spot ETFs as impossible, but the institution's attitude has changed 180 degrees and almost the entire cryptocurrency market is now waiting for approval for these products, with the final decision date of May 22.

LidoDAO Price Jumps 26% – Is It Too Late to Buy LDO? This Meme Coin Could Topple Shiba Inu / Source: Cryptonews
                        The LidoDAO (LDO) price continues to trade sharply up since the start of the week as bets for Ethereum ecosystem growth flood in on expectations that the SEC is on the verge of approving spot Ethereum ETFs, with some asking if it is too late to buy LDO.LDO is the native crypto of the decentralized Ether staking platform Lido. It also doubles up as the governance token of the Lido decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) that governs the Lido protocol.The LidoDAO price was last changing hands just above its 50DMA at $2.075. That’s a 26% jump in the past 7 days, as per CoinMarketCap.LDO is now roughly 37% up versus its earlier monthly lows around $1.50. While investors jumping in now won’t be buying the market at its local bottom, that doesn’t mean it’s too late to buy LidoDAO.Is It Too Late to Buy LidoDAO? Here’s Why It Isn’t
LDO remains nearly 50% down versus its January highs above $4.0. But if the Ethereum ecosystem is about to see massive ETF-driven growth, as one of its leading protocols, LDO could go a lot higher from here.If ETH hits $5,000 by June, which decentralized options markets on DeFi derivatives market Lyra suggests has a 20% chance of happening, then LDO could quickly 2x back to yearly highs.But LDO’s modest market cap of $1.8 billion suggests gains of more than 2x could come this bull market.LDO could see gains of at least 5x to become a $10 billion market cap crypto. In that sense, it definitely isn’t too late to buy LidoDAO.Crypto Alternative to Consider – Meme Coin Wiener AI (WAI)
While 5x gain potential is more than enough for most investors, some highly risk-tolerant individuals will be targeting a bigger upside.These investors should check out the market for up-and-coming meme coins.Most newly launched meme coins fall flat, or don’t retain long-term value.But if backed by a savvy marketing team that knows how to build a community, a new meme coin could easily 100x.Analysts at Cryptonews think Wiener AI (WAI) is one such coin.VIDEOThe meme coin market is over-saturated with Shiba Inu-themed coins boasting little to no real utility.Sausage dog-themed Wiener AI offers a new spin to the meme coin space.The meme coin also comes with in-built AI trading capabilities, differentiating it from other utility-lacking coins like Shiba Inu.It’s no surprise to see that Wiener AI has already raked in over $2.6 million in its presale.WAI is also a passive income gem. Presale Investors are currently earning a massive 381% APY, as per the project’s official website.At this rate, investors can double their initial presale investment in just a few months. 20% of the supply has been allocated to staking rewards.Potential WAI investors need to move quickly. The WAI price will rise when the presale hits $2.7 million.At the current price of $0.000709, WAI’s market cap is under $50 million.If it achieves market leadership, early investors stand to benefit greatly, with a potential for 100x gains or more.Buy Wiener AI Here

Kraken Affirms No Plans to Delist Tether in Europe Amid MiCA Compliance Review



                    

Cryptocurrency exchange Kraken has stated it has “no plans” to delist Tether (USDT) in Europe, contrary to a recent report suggesting the firm was “actively reviewing” the decision to remain legally compliant.



“[Kraken] continues to list USDT in Europe and we have no plans to delist at this time,” said Mark Greenberg, Kraken’s global head of asset growth and management, in a May 18 X post.




Greenberg emphasized that the firm will adhere to all legal requirements, even those it disagrees with. “But the rules are not finalized yet and we continue to do everything we can to continue to offer all relevant stablecoins to our European customers.”



A May 17 Bloomberg article had reported that Kraken was “actively reviewing” plans to comply with the European Union’s upcoming Markets in Crypto-Assets Regulation (MiCA) framework.



“We’re absolutely planning for all eventualities, including situations where it’s just not tenable to list specific tokens such as USDT,” said Marcus Hughes, Kraken’s global head of regulatory strategy, at the time.

“It’s something that we’re actively reviewing, and as the position becomes clearer, we can take firm decisions on that.”



The rules governing stablecoins under MiCA are set to take effect on June 30, while the broader rules for cryptocurrency service providers will come into force six months later on December 30.



One of Kraken’s major competitors, OKX, delisted USDT in Europe in March. 




Binance also announced similar plans last September, citing the need to comply with MiCA, but has yet to follow through.



In April, Kraken ceased support for the Monero privacy token for its customers in Belgium and Ireland.



Despite these regulatory challenges, Kraken has been expanding its services in Europe. 



The exchange recently secured a virtual asset service provider registration in Spain and the Netherlands, along with an electronic money institution license in Ireland.

Federal Reserve Officials Express Concerns Over Persistent Inflation, Remain Cautious on Rate Cuts | Cryptoglobe


                                
Federal Reserve officials have grown increasingly worried about the stubborn nature of inflation, as revealed in the minutes from the April 30-May 1 policy meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC). The minutes, released on Wednesday, indicated that policymakers lacked the confidence to move forward with interest rate reductions due to the lack of progress in bringing inflation down to the targeted 2% rate.



The meeting took place following a series of economic readings that showed inflation running well above the Fed’s target despite having eased over the past year. The minutes noted that “various participants mentioned a willingness to tighten policy further should risks to inflation materialize in a way that such an action became appropriate.”



The FOMC unanimously voted to maintain the benchmark short-term borrowing rate in a range of 5.25%-5.5%, the highest level in 23 years. While some incremental signs of progress on inflation have emerged since the meeting, such as the slightly lower consumer price index for April, consumer surveys indicate increasing worries about the inflation outlook.







            
            

            
            

            
            

        

Fed officials identified several upside risks to inflation, particularly from geopolitical events, and expressed concern about the pressure that inflation was having on consumers, especially those on the lower end of the wage scale. They also noted that consumers were resorting to riskier forms of financing, such as increased usage of credit cards and buy-now-pay-later services, to make ends meet as inflation persists.



Although officials were largely optimistic about growth prospects, they expected some moderation this year and grew uncertain over how long it would take for inflation to return to the 2% objective. Immigration was mentioned multiple times as a factor helping to spur the labor market and sustain consumption levels.



Public remarks from central bankers since the meeting have taken on a cautionary tone, with Fed Governor Christopher Waller stating earlier this week that he will need to see “several months” of good data before voting to cut rates. Last week, Jerome Powell maintained that the Fed will “need to be patient and let restrictive policy do its work” as inflation remains elevated.



According to a report by CNBC, markets have continued to adjust their expectations for rate cuts this year, with futures pricing indicating about a 60% chance of the first cut coming in September and a slightly better than 50-50 chance of a second move in December. This marks a significant shift from earlier this year when markets had been pricing in at least six quarter-percentage point cuts.

Gensler Must Answer for Prometheum, ‘Regulatory Uncertainty’ on Ethereum, Lawmakers Say - Decrypt

Republican lawmakers once again raised eyebrows over the controversial crypto firm Prometheum, demanding clarity from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) on Wednesday over how the firm will comply with a novel framework from the agency.The SEC introduced a framework for so-called special purpose broker-dealers (SPBDs) in 2020, and the designation allows firms to facilitate the trading of digital asset securities. Though it has not fully realized that vision yet, Prometheum is one of the sole firms to receive such a registration.In a letter signed by House Financial Services Committee Chairman Patrick McHenry (R-SC), Rep. Bill Huizenga (R-MI), and Rep. French Hill (R-AR), demands were made for the SEC to hand over records and communications related to Prometheum and the regulatory status of Ethereum.Prometheum, as a market ecosystem for digital asset securities, said Monday that it had launched custody services for Ethereum as a security, heightening jitters over the asset’s regulatory status among crypto market participants and perturbing the lawmakers.“Prometheum’s announcement that it will offer custody services for ETH [raises] a number of questions regarding what are, and what are not, permitted activities for SPBDs,” the lawmakers wrote. “Without answers, […] our concerns about the precedent being set by the SEC, Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA), and Prometheum are growing.”Last year, the House Financial Services Committee described Prometheum’s crypto gambit as “shady,” arguing the little-known crypto firm was being used by the SEC as a wedge to show that existing securities laws are sufficient for crypto firms to stay in compliance.As the agency faces pressure over how it regulates crypto, Prometheum co-CEO Aaron Kaplan’s testimony before Congress last year aligned with the SEC’s stance that a pathway toward compliance exists for crypto firms—as many other firms have argued compliance isn’t feasible.The Republican lawmakers argued Wednesday that the SEC has refused to provide them with any answers related to Prometheum. A response from the SEC last month failed to sufficiently describe how the firm will comply with its special purpose broker-dealer license, they argued.In a lawsuit filed by the Ethereum software giant Consensys in April, the firm alleged the SEC has internally viewed Ethereum as a security for over a year. And in a letter last month, McHenry accused SEC Chair Gensler of lying about the matter after sidestepping questions during congressional testimony last year.Edited by Andrew HaywardDaily Debrief NewsletterStart every day with the top news stories right now, plus original features, a podcast, videos and more.

Gala Co-Founder Confirms Hack, Says Security Incident Led to Unauthorized Sale of $21,000,000 Worth of Coins - The Daily Hodl


								The co-founder of Gala (GALA), Eric Schiermeyer, is revealing the genesis of an exploit that led to the loss of crypto assets worth millions of dollars on the blockchain-based gaming platform.
Schiermeyer says that a security incident triggered the “unauthorized SALE of 600 million ($21 million) GALA tokens and the effective BURN of 4.4 billion tokens.”










According to the Gala co-founder, securing and removing unauthorized access to the web3 gaming platform built on the Ethereum blockchain was initiated and completed in less than an hour.
“It’s important to note our Ethereum contract for GALA is secure and under the protection of a multi-signature wallet. It was never compromised.
We messed up our internal controls…This shouldn’t have happened and we are taking steps to ensure it doesn’t ever again.”
Schiermeyer further says that the culprit’s identity is possibly now known and the blockchain-based gaming platform is working with the U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) and a “network of international authorities”.
According to a pseudonymous developer who reportedly first discovered the exploit, the hacker who had obtained administrator privileges on the web3 gaming platform’s smart contract minted billions of Gala tokens before selling some of them.
“There is a cap [on the number of GALA tokens that can be minted], but still 12 billion more tokens that can be minted before that cap.
The attacker has had their address blocklisted, so can’t sell or mint anymore unless they have access to another admin address.”
GALA is trading at $0.0411 at time of writing, down by around 5% over the last 24 hours.

Bitcoin may be coming to the biggest crypto wallet on Ethereum

Photo: Jose Cabezas (Reuters)Popular  cryptocurrency wallet MetaMask might soon add Bitcoin support, CoinDesk reports. An unnamed source cited by the outlet said access could be granted within the next month, while another mentioned that the functionality is not yet finalized. The features may be initially limited and then expanded over time.RFK Jr. investing in GameStop is hilarious, exec saysA blockchain software company, Consensys created MetaMask to connect users to Ethereum’s blockchain ecosystem. The wallet supports Ethereum and Ethereum Virtual Machines (EVMs), such as Avalanche, Polygon, Optimism, and Arbitrum.Currently, MetaMask does not directly facilitate Bitcoin acquisition. Users must make the transactions using Wrapped Bitcoin (WBTC). A Wrapped Bitcoin is a tokenized version of Bitcoin that operates on the Ethereum blockchain. It is pegged 1:1 to Bitcoin, so one Wrapped Bitcoin is always equal to one Bitcoin. It acts as a bridge between Bitcoin and Ethereum’s decentralized applications (dApps). If the CoinDesk report pans out, MetaMask users will soon be able to add Bitcoin directly.This is not the first time MetaMask has expanded beyond the Ethereum ecosystem. In 2023, the company added a feature called Snaps. Snaps are JavaScript applications that enable cross-chain interoperability, allowing different blockchain networks to communicate and interact without intermediaries.Users have downloaded MetaMask’s apps over 22.66 million times, according to CoinGecko.

                        Hong Kong police have arrested 100 individuals in a significant crackdown on fraud and money-laundering syndicates, recovering over HK$180 million (US$24.2 million) from 295 victims.In a two-week operation code-named “Widepeak,” which concluded on Monday, 75 men and 25 women were detained on suspicion of money laundering and obtaining property by deception. Cryptocurrency Scam Amongst OthersChief Inspector Cheng Ki-fung of the Sham Shui Po district crime squad disclosed that most suspects were holders of stooge accounts, with occupations ranging from cleaners and chefs to decoration workers. These individuals allegedly loaned or sold their bank accounts to criminal syndicates, enabling the collection and laundering of scammed money in exchange for a cut of the proceeds.Chief Inspector Cheng revealed that the suspects were linked to 82 cases of deception. These included investment scams, employment fraud, internet love scams, e-shopping swindles, and telephone deception. The most significant financial loss stemmed from an investment scam targeting a 74-year-old businessman. An online acquaintance lured him into investing in cryptocurrency and swindled him out of HK$23 million.Inspector Wong Sze-ki highlighted another notable case involving an online shopping scam. This scam deceived 54 victims into spending more than HK$70,000 on supposed discount tickets for travel, theme parks, and hotel staycations.In response to these rising scams, the police have advised the public to utilize the force’s “Scameter“ search engine, available through the CyberDefender website or app, to verify suspicious or fraudulent schemes. The search engine helps identify dubious web addresses, emails, platform usernames, bank accounts, mobile phone numbers, and IP addresses. The force’s 18222 “Anti-Scam Helpline“ is also available for assistance.The crackdown was launched following a nearly 30% rise in reported deception cases in Sham Shui Po district, escalating from 1,873 in 2022 to 2,419 last year. The district recorded 706 deception cases in the first four months of this year alone.Superintendent Chen Chi-cheong, assistant Sham Shui Po district commander, emphasized the importance of targeting stooge accounts, which are vital to fraud networks for collecting and laundering illicit funds. He warned the public against lending or selling their bank accounts to others, as they could face money laundering charges punishable by up to 14 years in jail and a HK$5 million fine.The Rising Concern of Crypto Fraud in Hong Kong
The city experienced a 42.6% increase in all deception cases last year, with 39,824 reports filed, up from 27,923 in 2022. Financial losses from these cases surged by 89%, rising to HK$9.1 billion in 2023 from HK$4.8 billion the previous year.Superintendent Chen added that over 200 holders of stooge accounts were arrested by Sham Shui Po police for money laundering and conspiracy to launder money in the past year. Prosecution has been approved, and charges have been filed against 111 individuals. 11 convictions led to prison sentences ranging from four to 28 months.As reported on May 21, scammers target South Korean crypto users with an Ethereum-themed scam. Fraudsters send alarming text messages to users, warning them that their ETH coins will be “burned“ on May 22 if they do not act quickly. The messages, allegedly from a fake global cryptocurrency exchange named Bit-Finance, urge users to withdraw their funds immediately to avoid losing them. Recipients are directed to a phishing site where scammers attempt to steal wallet details and passwords.Police and regulators have noted the rise in such scams, with cybercrime related to virtual assets increasing in South Korea. Last year, the National Police Agency dealt with 167,688 cyber fraud cases, a 7.68% increase from 2022, with crimes involving virtual assets accounting for 38.3%. Between January and April of this year, 2,209 reports of financial losses due to crypto scams were filed with the Financial Supervisory Service, 17.7% of which were related to phishing attacks.

Shiba Inu Price Can’t Reach $0.01, Crypto Pundit Reveals Why


																Crypto analyst Oscar Ramos has outlined why he doesn’t believe the Shiba Inu price can go above $0.01 this cycle. He made this statement while alluding to the possibility of the meme coin reaching $0.5 at some point in the future. 
Why Shiba Inu Can’t Go Above $0.01
Ramos mentioned in an X (formerly Twitter) post that Shiba Inu can’t go above $0.01 because of its current supply of over 589 trillion, according to data from CoinMarketCap. The crypto analyst made this remark while sharing a prediction chart from the price prediction website Telegaon, which showed that Shiba Inu could reach $0.5 in 2040.

Source: Telegoan
 
Indeed, Shiba Inu’s circulating supply significantly impacts its price, which is why the Shiba Inu team has made a conscious effort to reduce the amount of SHIB tokens in circulation through regular token burns. Shiba Inu’s burn tracker had previously noted that Shiba Inu’s circulating supply would need to be just over 85 billion for its price to even reach $0.01, as Ramos predicts.  
That means almost 80% of Shiba Inu’s circulating supply still needs to be burned for the meme coin to attain Ramos’ price target. Crypto YouTuber Jeff had previously suggested that it was almost impossible for Shiba Inu to burn that much of its circulating supply, stating that it would take over 1 million years for Shiba Inu’s circulating supply to reduce to 100 billion tokens. 
However, there is no doubt that the Shiba Inu team has still made great efforts to reduce the meme coin’s circulating supply. Over 76 billion SHIB tokens were burned in 2023, while 83 billion were burned the previous year. Seeing how Shiba Inu’s price has increased since last year, these efforts are paying off. 
While burning 80% of Shiba Inu’s circulating supply still seems like a far-fetched goal, SHIB token burns are expected to increase exponentially, especially thanks to innovations like layer-2 network Shibarium, which uses some of the transaction fees earned for SHIB burns. Therefore, the number of token burns carried out will increase as Shibarium enjoys more adoption. 
SHIB Can At Least Rise To $0.011
Crypto analyst Ali Martinez had previously predicted that Shiba Inu could make a historic run from its current price level and rise to as high as $0.011. Other crypto analysts have also given bullish price predictions for Shiba Inu, although not as bullish as Martinez’s. 

	Related Reading


Crypto analyst Armando Pantoja predicted that Shiba Inu could reach $0.001 and even claimed this would happen after the Bitcoin halving. Ramos has also given his bullish prediction for SHIB in this bull run, as he predicts that the meme coin can shed another zero from its current price and rise to $0.0001. 
At the time of writing, Shiba Inu is trading at around $0.00002603, up over 2% in the last 24 hours, according to data from CoinMarketCap.

Analyst Unveils Bitcoin and Ethereum Price Targets, Says Incoming Altcoin Opportunities Will Be ‘Insane’ - The Daily Hodl


								A widely followed analyst believes that the crypto market is on the verge of witnessing the next leg of its bull cycle.
Pseudonymous analyst Kaleo tells his 639,700 followers on the social media platform X that the real bull market has not even started yet.










The crypto strategist says that Bitcoin (BTC) is currently in its post-halving accumulation phase as it gears up to rally toward an upside target of as high as $200,000.
“The upside of each major bull market has seen significant attrition from a post-halving percentage growth perspective, with each respective all-time high (ATH) move reducing ~3.5x from the previous cycle. If this trend continues, the ATH this cycle for BTC would land somewhere between $150,000 – $200,000.”
Source: Kaleo/X
At time of writing, Bitcoin is trading at $70,016.
Looking at Ethereum (ETH), Kaleo thinks that the leading smart contract platform will soar to about $12,000 this cycle.
“As much fun as today’s news was, this chart is just getting warmed up. Send it higher.” 
Source: Kaleo/X
At time of writing, ETH is worth $3,774.
As for other crypto assets, Kaleo thinks that the massive capital inflows to Bitcoin and Ethereum will trigger an altcoin mania.
“The opportunity that comes with THAT type of money moving will be insane. Alts and DApps (decentralized applications) will go crazy. We’ll probably see a crypto-native DApp hit the mainstream market at one point or another. Retail hasn’t even shown up in masses yet. 
Don’t let the chop shake you out. We’re just getting warmed up.”

Ethereum sees $2.3B in inflows as ETF anticipation sparks optimism - AMBCrypto



Ethereum saw around $2.3 billion inflows.
The ETH price rise triggered a notable short liquidation volume.

Ethereum [ETH] recently experienced a significant price move, triggering a large volume of short liquidations and leading to a record inflow volume. 
Amid these developments, there is speculation that institutions might be preparing for the potential approval of an Ethereum-based financial product.
Ethereum sees significant flow into exchanges
AMBCrypto’s analysis of Ethereum’s inflow chart on CryptoQuant showed that traders have moved to take advantage of the recent price increase. 
On the 21st of May, around 627,770 ETH, valued at over $2.3 billion at approximately $3,789 per ETH, flowed into exchanges. This marked the second-largest inflow volume in over a year.
 The largest inflow occurred in March when 648,000 ETH, also worth about $2.3 billion, were transferred. At press time, the inflow had already exceeded 100,000 ETH.
Source: CryptoQuant
Due to these substantial inflows, Ethereum’s Netflow has been positive over the past few days. The Netflow indicated that more ETH was entering exchanges than leaving. 
On the 21st of May, the Netflow was around 49,000 ETH — this trend continued with an additional Netflow of over 5,600 ETH at the time of writing.
Ethereum shorts see more liquidation
Another effect of the recent Ethereum price increase has been a surge in liquidation volume. 
According to AMBCrypto’s analysis of the liquidation chart, short traders have experienced significant liquidations in the past few days. 
Source: CryptoQuant
On the 20th of May, approximately 20,558 ETH, valued at over $75.2 million, were liquidated, marking the second-highest short liquidation volume in over a year. 
The trend continued on the 21st of May, with over 11,600 ETH worth around $44 million being liquidated.
Institutions preparing for ETF approval?
Amid the recent price increase in Ethereum, there is growing speculation about the imminent approval of an Ethereum ETF. 
Commentators are optimistic about this approval, and some analysts believe that institutions are already preparing for it. 
A CryptoQuant chart showed notable outflows of ETH on Coinbase on the 11th and 27th of March and 18th April, with volumes of approximately -134,000, -120,454, and -133,000 ETH, respectively. 
Similar outflow patterns were observed on Coinbase before the announcement of the Bitcoin ETF approval in January, suggesting that institutions might be positioning themselves for a potential approval now as well.

ETH sees a slight drop
Ethereum surged to approximately $3,661 following a 19% increase on the 20th of May.

Shiba Inu Burn Rate Climbs 434% Amid Market Recovery, Can It Send SHIB To $0.0001? | Bitcoinist.com


								The Shiba Inu burn rate has accelerated once again after a lackluster start to the week. The burn rate has surged over 400% in the last 24 hours alone, signifying a move alongside the Shiba Inu price as the crypto market rally continues.
Shiba Inu Sees 434% Spike In Burn Rate
The burn rate, over the past days, has seen a significant amount of tokens burned compared to the start of the week, according to burn tracking website, Shibburn. At the time of writing, there has been a total of 18 burn transactions recorded in the last 24 hours, which have seen almost 14 million SHIB tokens incinerated.

This figure is a 434% increase from the prior day’s figure of 2.6 million. This had been a 67% decline from Monday, so this turn in the burn volume is a welcome development for the meme coin. Additionally, the increase in the number of burn transactions shows a growing interest among Shiba Inu holders to participate in reducing the supply of the token.
Some notable burn transactions from the last 24 hours include 8 transactions in total carrying more than 1 million tokens to the burn address. Naturally, these addresses make up the bulk of the burned tokens, with smaller transactions thrown in there as well.
Despite this significant increase in daily burn rate, the weekly burn rate is still suffering. Shibburn’s data shows that a little over 42.4 million tokens have been burned during this time. However, it represents a 70.41% decline from the previous week’s figure, showing that the burns for this week are falling short already. Nevertheless, the movement of SHIB tokens to the burn address is a plus overall to the ecosystem, no matter how small.


Can SHIB Burn Send Price To $0.0001?
The Shiba Inu burn initiative is something that is meant to propel the SHIB price by reducing the amount of tokens in circulation. This became important as the SHIB supply is more than 500 trillion, greatly limiting its upside potential. Thus, by reducing the supply, the community hopes to propel demand.

However, the SHIB burn has not moved as fast as expected. Going on two years since its inception, the burn is yet to reach 1 trillion tokens. To put this in perspective, around 410.7 trillion tokens have been burned in total. Of this, Ethereum founder Vitalik Buterin burned 410 trillion tokens which were sent to him in 2021. This means that the community has collectively burned around 700 billion tokens since the burn began.
At this rate, it is unlikely that the Shiba Inu burn will propel the SHIB price toward $0.0001 anytime soon. However, with the crypto market picking up and Bitcoin rallying toward a new all-time high, SHIB still has the potential to reach this figure, which would be around a 300% increase from its current price level.

Crypto Analyst Says It’s Time for Altcoins to Rally, Predicts New Bitcoin Breakout Amid Bullish Technical Setup - The Daily Hodl


								A closely followed analyst says that altcoins are likely about to spark new rallies while Bitcoin (BTC) decides its next move.
Pseudonymous trader Rekt Capital tells his 470,000 followers on the social media platform X that altcoins are at the beginning of the “hype cycle” phase where they find bottoms before making new impulses to the upside.










“Welcome to the Q2 Altcoin Hype Cycle
The Altcoin Bottoming Out process is in progress.”
Source: Rekt Capital/X
At time of writing, the total altcoin market capitalization is coming in at $294 billion, up from $76 billion in November of 2022 during the worst of the bear market.
Looking at Bitcoin, Rekt Capital says BTC is potentially forming a bull flag on the monthly chart. Bull flags, as the name suggests, are typically seen as bullish technical setups that imply an upward impulse and then a brief consolidation before another move up.
“Imagine if Bitcoin was forming a Monthly Bull Flag right now.”
Source: Rekt Capital/X
However, according to the trader, those looking for a longer and more robust bull market may prefer BTC to consolidate for longer before continuing upward. He says that a clean break of $71,500 could indicate that BTC is in for a shorter, faster bull run.
“Extended consolidation here would get Bitcoin closer to resynchronising with historical Halving Cycles
After all, the current acceleration in the cycle is still around 190 days (which is an improvement from the 260-day acceleration set in mid-March when BTC made new All Time Highs)
On the one hand, investors understandably want a breakout, but that would entail an Accelerated Cycle, where Bitcoin would probably peak in its Bull Market sooner
On the other hand, extended consolidation here would help with resynchronisation with historical Halving Cycles, resulting in a longer Bull Run
There is no right or wrong answer – both cases are bullish
It’s more a question of whether we get a shorter bull run or a typically long one
History suggests we should see a typically long one but Bitcoin is one Weekly Close above the $71500 Range High from going against the grain of history once again.”
At time of writing, Bitcoin is trading at $70,221.

Hong Kong Just Kicked Out Worldcoin Over Privacy Concerns - Decrypt

The Hong Kong government ordered Worldcoin to cease operations within its borders on Wednesday, accusing the identity project of skirting its privacy rules. The administration's Privacy Commissioner for Personal Data (PCPD) is demanding Worldcoin leave Hong Kong—and is asking citizens to report if they see further Worldcoin operations.“The privacy commissioner has served an enforcement notice on Worldcoin Foundation, directing it to cease all operations of the Worldcoin project in Hong Kong in scanning and collecting iris and face images of members of the public using iris scanning devices,” the PCPD said.The PCPD claims that the collection of face and iris images was unnecessary and excessive. It also alleges that Worldcoin collected personal data unfairly by not providing privacy notices and consent forms in Chinese, failing to disclose all possible risks, and not clearly informing participants of the reason for the collection.While the project's Orb hardware is a signature part of its operation, Hong Kong administrators said they weren't needed to verify someone's humanity.“Scanning or collection of face images was not required for the purpose of verifying the humanness of the participants as the iris scanning device operators were already in the position to carry out such verification at the operating locations,” the PCPD said in the report.Formed in 1996, the Office of the Privacy Commissioner for Personal Data is an independent body that oversees the enforcement of Hong Kong’s personal data laws.Launched in 2022, Worldcoin—developed by Tools For Humanity, co-founded by OpenAI CEO Sam Altman, and stewarded by the non-profit Worldcoin Foundation—uses controversial Orb iris scanners and its World ID application to combat bots by ensuring members or users of a system are actual people. Participants are issued WLD tokens in exchange for letting Worldcoin scan users' biometrics.According to Tools For Humanity, since its launch, World ID has drawn over 10 million users in 160 countries, with over 5 million people having verified their identity using the Worldcoin Orbs.“Taking into account biometric data is sensitive personal data, any wrongful disclosure or leakage of such data could lead to grave consequences,” the PCPD wrote. “Given that there were less privacy-intrusive means as alternative options to verify the identity of the participants, the collection of face and iris images for such purpose was not necessary, and excessive, thereby contravening the requirements of [our Data Protection Principles].”Worldcoin did not immediately respond to Decrypt’s request for comment.In March, to alleviate privacy concerns surrounding its Orb iris scanners, Worldcoin open-sourced core components on Github, allowing researchers to examine the technology more deeply.“Open sourcing typically helps to foster trust, transparency, and verifiability while also encouraging developer communities to further advance a technology,” a Worldcoin spokesperson previously told Decrypt. “This builds on the open sourcing of the iris code last late last year and opening up of the hardware nearly a year ago.”Despite the PCPD’s actions, Worldcoin’s WLD token is up 0.8% for the day and 5.0% for the last seven days according to CoinGecko.Edited by Ryan Ozawa.Daily Debrief NewsletterStart every day with the top news stories right now, plus original features, a podcast, videos and more.

Shocking Interest Rate Remarks from Goldman Sachs CEO: Will There Be A Rate Cut This Year? Revealed His Forecast - Bitcoin Sistemi


Goldman Sachs CEO David Solomon made a bold prediction about the future of the Fed's interest rates. Speaking at an event held at Boston College, Solomon stated that he does not currently expect the FED to make any reductions in interest rates this year.
The CEO's prediction comes amid an economy that has shown remarkable resilience, thanks largely to government spending. “I still don't see compelling data to say we will lower interest rates here,” Solomon said, adding that he currently foresees “zero” reductions.



Solomon also emphasized the role of investments in artificial intelligence infrastructure in increasing the economy's resilience to the FED's monetary tightening. That resilience could be a key factor in the decision not to cut rates, according to Solomon.
However, Solomon also warned of the risk of a significant economic slowdown, which he described as “real and palpable”. Noting that this risk is greater now than six months ago, Solomon also cited geopolitical fragility as an important factor contributing to this. “This is something people will have to live with for a long time,” he warned.

Pepe Price Prediction as PEPE Pumps Up 30% and Hits a New All-Time High – 100x Possible? / Source: Cryptonews
                        As the Pepe (PEPE) price continues to pump to new record highs, with PEPE up 30% in the past 7 days, investors are asking whether 100x gains for the meme coin might be possible.Pepe was last trading around $0.00001350, giving it a market cap of around $5.7 billion.100x gains would see Pepe reach a market cap of $570 billion.Almost all crypto experts would agree that, in the short-term anyway, Pepe doesn’t stand much chance of going this high.Ether (ETH), the cryptocurrency that powers the most widely used/adopted smart-contract-enabled blockchain Ethereum, only has a market cap of $450 billion.Pepe Price Prediction – How High Can It Go?
While aiming for 100x gains is likely overly ambitious given Pepe’s already large market cap, its outlook remains strong.Traders have been buying the Ethereum-issued meme coin aggressively amid growing expectations for Ethereum ETF approvals from the SEC.These traders seem to be betting on Pepe as a major beneficiary of accelerated Ethereum ecosystem growth.Pepe’s market cap is still 4x lower than Dogecoin’s. And Dogecoin could yet 2 or 3x this bull market.If Pepe catches up, that means it could still post 10x gains from here.That would imply that the Pepe price has the potential to erase another zero to hit $0.00010.Pepe Alternative to Consider – Multi-chain Meme Coin Dogeverse (DV)
Most investors would be more than happy with 10x gains. But many meme coin investors are hunting bigger upside of 50-100x.The best way to bag these bigger gains is to get in early on a new meme coin gem.One meme coin that the team at Cryptonews thinks fits this bill is Dogeverse.Dogeverse is a new meme coin with unique cross-chain capabilities and is generating considerable excitement in the market.Dogeverse seeks to be the multi-chain equivalent of Dogecoin and is launching on the six most popular blockchains (excluding Bitcoin).Dogeverse’s cross-chain bridging capabilities further enhance its appeal, making it a “Doge with superpowers.”Currently in presale, Dogeverse has raised over $15 million.  Interested investors should get in quick ahead of the token’s official launch.Visit Dogeverse Here

Pepe price hits new all-time high: here's why it's soaring - CoinJournal



                    

                    
Pepe price hits $0.0000142 ATH, showcasing its resilience and market prominence.
Ethereum’s surge and altcoin rotation among the factors fueling Pepe’s rally.
Despite early investor profit-taking, bullish sentiment persists, fueled by whale activity.

In a remarkable turn of events, the price of Pepe price has surged to a new all-time high, reaching approximately $0.0000142.
This surge marks a significant milestone for the frog-themed meme coin, as it solidifies its position as one of the top performers in the crypto market.

Notably, the current bullish momentum in Pepe’s price comes after a period of internal challenges among developers, indicating a remarkable turnaround for the cryptocurrency.
Despite its rocky start, Pepe has gained substantial traction in recent times, with its market capitalization exceeding $5.77 billion.
What is behind the current Pepe price surge?
The altcoin market, including Pepe, has benefited from a notable shift in investor sentiment, with capital flowing from Bitcoin to alternative assets.
This rotation of funds has fueled the ongoing altcoin recovery, with Pepe emerging as a standout performer in this resurgence.
Pepe’s adoption and liquidity have also played a crucial role in its price appreciation. With deep liquidity of nearly $60 million in Wrapped Ether (WETH) and over 223,000 holders facilitating approximately 2 million transfers, Pepe has demonstrated robust on-chain activity.
However, amidst the euphoria surrounding Pepe’s price surge, there are also signs of caution. On-chain data analysts like Lookonchain have flagged instances of profit-taking by early Pepe (PEPE) investors.
Nevertheless, despite these concerns, bullish sentiment remains strong, with heightened whale purchase activity in the Pepe ecosystem fueling expectations of a fresh bull run in the coming weeks.
Moreover, the potential approval of spot Ether ETFs by the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) could provide further catalysts for Pepe’s upward trajectory. The current Pepe price surge seems to closely mirror that of Ethereum (ETH) amid the hype created by the potential ether ETFs approval.
Pepe followed suit, highlighting the interconnectedness of various cryptocurrencies within the broader market ecosystem.

How Perplexity Ai Helped Druckenmiller to Invest in Argentina | Cryptoglobe


                                
In a recent CNBC interview, billionaire investor Stanley Druckenmiller shared his thoughts on a wide range of topics, including the Federal Reserve’s monetary policy, inflation, artificial intelligence (AI), and his global investment strategies.



Stanley Druckenmiller is highly regarded for his consistent and impressive investment performance, particularly during his tenure at the Quantum Fund with George Soros. He played a pivotal role in the fund’s legendary 1992 bet against the British pound, which netted a profit of over $1 billion. Known for his long-term vision and macroeconomic analysis, Druckenmiller has successfully navigated various market conditions, showcasing his adaptability and strategic acumen. 



His ability to time markets and manage risk effectively has resulted in significant returns with relatively low risk. Beyond his investment success, Druckenmiller has been a mentor to many in the financial industry, influencing a generation of investors. Additionally, his substantial philanthropic efforts in education, medical research, and social causes have further enhanced his reputation, making him a respected figure both in finance and beyond.



Druckenmiller expressed his perplexity regarding the Fed’s December pivot, believing that they had fumbled an opportunity to control inflation when it was coming down and financial conditions were tightening. He criticized the Fed’s forward guidance, arguing that it trapped them into a cycle of talking about rate cuts, which led to a melt-up in financial conditions. Druckenmiller suggested that the Fed should eliminate forward guidance and simply raise or cut rates as needed without trying to be a “rockstar” on “60 Minutes.”



The investor also questioned the Fed’s obsession with achieving a soft landing, citing Paul Volcker’s willingness to put the economy into a recession to achieve long-term prosperity. He warned that the current focus on avoiding pain could lead to political consequences, as the average American is more affected by rising gasoline prices than stock prices.



Druckenmiller gave the Biden administration an “F” for their economic policies, arguing that they are misdiagnosing the current situation as a depression and overspending when the private sector is healthy and innovative. He expressed concern that government spending and resulting interest rates on debt could crowd out private sector innovation in areas such as blockchain and AI.



On the topic of AI, Druckenmiller revealed that he had invested in Nvidia after being advised by a young partner who predicted the company’s potential in the AI space. Although he pared back his position after significant gains, Druckenmiller remains bullish on AI in the long term, comparing it to the early days of the internet. He acknowledged that AI might be overhyped in the short term but could be underestimated in the long run.



Druckenmiller also discussed his investment in Perplexity AI, an AI-powered answer machine that he believes could potentially challenge Google. He praised the company’s founder and team for their innovation and humility and encouraged viewers to try the platform for themselves.







            
            

            
            

            
            

        

When asked about the potential for AI language models to become commoditized, Druckenmiller admitted that it is a concern and one of the reasons he reduced his positions. He also questioned the long-term incremental value of increasingly costly AI models.



Regarding the upcoming U.S. presidential election, Druckenmiller expressed concerns about both candidates’ potential impact on inflation. He suggested that under a Trump administration, factors such as tariffs, immigration, and animal spirits could lead to inflation reaching 6% by 2025. Under a Biden administration, he worried about stagflation due to government spending, regulation, and the Fed’s impact on financial conditions.



Druckenmiller also discussed his investments in Argentina and Japan. He praised Argentina’s new leader, Javier Milei, for his free-market policies and ability to maintain public support despite implementing significant reforms. In Japan, Druckenmiller sees opportunities arising from the country’s shift towards corporate governance changes and its emergence from a prolonged period of deflation.



The story of how he invested in Argentina was quite interesting. 



Druckenmiller said:



“By the way, do you want to hear how I invested in Argentina? It’s a funny story. I saw — I wasn’t at Davos, but I saw the speech in Davos and it was about 1:00 in the afternoon in my office. I dialed up Perplexity and I said, give me the five most liquid ADRs in Argentina … It gave me enough of a description that I follow the old Soros rule, invest and then investigate. I bought all of them. We did some work on them. I increased my positions and so far, it’s been great. But we’ll see.“



Finally, Druckenmiller shared his bullish outlook on copper, citing the long lead times for new production and the increasing demand from electric vehicles, power grids, data centers, and even munitions. He also reiterated his stance on not investing in China as long as the current leader remains in power, preferring to focus on exciting opportunities in the United States, Argentina, and Japan.

SEC's Gensler Going Rogue in Solo Quest to Stop U.S. Crypto Legislation?

The SEC's sister agency in policing the U.S. markets, the Commodity Futures and Trading Commission (CFTC), has taken a strong pro-legislation position, arguing that existing law leaves a hole in oversight of the crypto spot markets for non-securities, such as bitcoin (BTC). CFTC Chairman Rostin Behnam has told lawmakers that "Congress needs to act" on crypto legislation, and he's said that if FIT21 passes, his agency can build a regulatory framework within 12 months. A CFTC spokesperson told CoinDesk on Tuesday that the agency would not comment on the bill.

MetaMask Reportedly Adding Native Bitcoin Support | Bankless


MetaMask, Ethereum’s reigning wallet giant, is exploring native Bitcoin support, CoinDesk reports – citing sources familiar with the matter.What's the scoop?CoinDesk's source said the Bitcoin integration could launch as early as June 2024. Another source said MetaMask was still working to finalize feature ideas.“While we can't confirm any timeline for specific developments at this time, we're always working on innovations to serve our users better,” a MetaMask spokesperson told CoinDesk. “Stay tuned for further updates when we're ready to share more."Bankless take:Newer wallet challengers like Magic Eden Wallet and Phantom have made significant inroads lately by catering to increasingly multichain crypto users. In combination with MetaMask Snaps, MetaMask's native embrace of Bitcoin signals it’s far from ready to cede the multichain opportunity to its competitors. If MetaMask goes beyond BTC support and integrates additional Bitcoin token offerings like Ordinals and Runes, this could prove to be a significant catalyst to the Bitcoin ecosystem over time, as MetaMask currently boasts over 30 million monthly active users. It may also be the first of more native integrations, which could reposition MetaMask as a leading multichain wallet.

Cryptocurrency Exchange CEO Says "Everything is Bullish", Explains Why - Bitcoin Sistemi


According to data, Ethereum call options have become more expensive than put options across all maturities. According to one analyst, this trend indicates a bullish trend in the market.
Luuk Strijers, CEO of cryptocurrency exchange Deribit, said in an email: “The bid minus bid skew is negative across all maturities and increases further beyond the end-June expiry, which is a very bullish signal, with the basis at around 14% per year.” “It has risen to e, which is another bullish indicator.”



The analysis shows that investors are willing to pay more for calls than for puts, especially for options expiring at the end of June and later. This trend could be an indicator of a bull market, according to the CEO, as it shows that traders are predicting that ETH prices will rise in the future.
There has been renewed optimism regarding the potential approval of spot ETH ETFs following a surprise filing request by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).





“We have observed a significant increase in trading volumes and volatility for ETH options and futures on Deribit. In fact, we recorded an almost unprecedented trading volume of $12.5 billion in the last 24 hours,” Strijers continued.

Bipartisan Drive For Crypto Regulation Signals White House-Congress Collaboration | Bitcoinist.com


								In the lead-up to the November elections, cryptocurrencies have become a prominent topic in the race for the White House. Notably, the Biden administration has changed its approach to digital asset regulation, likely influenced by former President Donald Trump’s support for the nascent industry.
Biden Administration Calls For Balanced Crypto Regulation
In an executive release, the Biden administration opposed the passage of H.R. 4763, a bill that would impact the regulatory structure for digital assets in the United States. 
Instead, the administration aims to collaborate with Congress to establish a “comprehensive and balanced” regulatory framework that promotes responsible development and innovation in the crypto assets and payment sectors. 

The administration also cited the lack of sufficient protections for consumers and investors in H.R. 4763 and emphasized the need for adequate guardrails while fostering innovation.
Senate And House Overturn SEC Rule
The Senate also recently voted to overturn Staff Accounting Bulletin 121 (SAB-121), an SEC rule that imposed burdensome accounting standards on cryptocurrency assets held by financial institutions. This decision followed the House’s approval of the same pro-crypto measure. 
Additionally, the House is set to consider the Financial Innovation and Technology for the 21st Century Act (FIT21), a bill to establish a regulatory regime for the crypto industry in the United States. 
The potential approval of spot exchange-traded funds (ETFs) for Ethereum by the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) further indicates a shifting tide in favor of cryptocurrencies.
According to a Fortune Magazine report, President Biden intends to veto the Congressional action reversing SAB-121. Still, lawmakers within his party, including Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer and Corey Booker of New Jersey, have voted to repeal the SEC rule. 
SAB-121 required financial institutions to treat crypto accounts as liabilities, making the safekeeping of digital assets economically unviable. A recent bipartisan analysis by the Congressional Research Service highlighted the potential limitations and costs associated with this rule, signaling a need for regulatory adjustments.
Trump Campaign Champions Financial Freedom
While blockchain technology remains a bipartisan focus, the Trump campaign has made a noteworthy move by announcing its acceptance of donations in Bitcoin and various cryptocurrencies. 
This marks a significant milestone as the first major party Presidential nominee to embrace cryptocurrency for fundraising purposes. The campaign integrates digital assets such as Bitcoin, Ethereum, Ripple, Dogecoin, and Shiba Inu, allowing donations through Coinbase Commerce.
The Trump campaign’s foray into cryptocurrency fundraising expands its digital fundraising operation and serves as a political statement supporting Bitcoin and crypto’s role in enhancing financial freedom and innovation. 

As the race to the White House intensifies, the Biden administration’s shifting stance on regulation and the Trump campaign’s embrace of digital asset donations highlight the evolving landscape of digital assets in politics and regulations. 
The upcoming elections are likely to shape further the trajectory of blockchain technology and its impact on the financial sector.

Beyond Bitcoin: How MicroStrategy stock beat the crypto market - AMBCrypto



MicroStrategy stock has outperformed BTC, miner stocks and Coinbase’s COIN.
Despite having more upside potential on price charts, MSTR could be affected by BTC’s pullback. 

MicroStrategy’s stock [MSTR] was apparently the best-performing share with Bitcoin’s [BTC] exposure last week. 
MSTR shares rallied 34% last week and reclaimed the $1500 level, boosted by the BTC recovery and MicroStrategy’s inclusion in the MSCI Index. The rally extended into the current week and hit a high of $1740, tucking an extra +4% as of 22nd May. 
Overall, the MSTR’s remarkable double-digit performance eclipsed even Coinbase [COIN] and several other Bitcoin miner stocks. 
MicroStrategy stock vs other BTC-linked stocks
MicroStrategy’s shares recorded 3.6X more gains than Coinbase’s, the largest US cryptocurrency exchange, stock [COIN] when performance was adjusted on the weekly chart.  
MSTR was up 22% in the past five trading days, compared to COIN’s 6% over the same period. 
Interestingly, collective Bitcoin miner stocks also saw remarkable double-digit gains but were slightly lower than MSTR over the same period. 
Notably, Valkyrie Bitcoin Miners ETF [WGMI], which tracks top BTC miner stocks, including Marathon Digital’s stock [MARA], recorded 12.8% gains in the past five-day trading period. 
That said, MSTR eclipsed COIN, and overall BTC miner stocks over the last 5-day trading sessions. However, it’s worth noting that COIN’s performance has remained relatively muted, partly because of the ongoing lawsuit with the US SEC. 
MicroStrategy, under the guidance of its founder and CEO, Michael Saylor, has maintained its Bitcoin strategy. 
So far, in Q2, the firm added 122 BTC, bringing its total BTC war chest to 214,400 coins, worth over $15 billion based on current market prices. 
Compared to the firm’s current total of 17.7 million shares as of 22nd May, its BTC per share was approximately 0.01209 BTC. 
But large number of investors have thronged to MSTR, sometimes way higher than BTC, the underlying asset they are seeking exposure to. 
But MSTR’s allure could be irresistible, especially compared to BTC’s performance. MSTR has outperformed BTC on a weekly, monthly and YTD (Year-to-Date) basis.
In May, MSTR was up 55% compared to BTC’s 15%. On the YTD front, MSTR’s gains were over 140%, while BTC’s value was +58%. 
It meant MSTR holders had better returns than their BTC counterparts. So, what’s next for MSTR’s price? 
What’s next for MSTR’s price?

On the daily chart, the key next bullish targets were the ATH of $1999 and $2300 based on the Fib retracement tool (yellow). The bullish reading on the RSI (Relative Strength Index) indicated that the above bullish targets were feasible. 
However, despite MSTR outperforming BTC on the price charts, a pullback by the king coin could erase part of the share’s gains. 
At the time of writing, BTC eased slightly below $70K after hitting the range-highs at $71K, while MSTR traded at $1650. MSTR’s further rally could be derailed if BTC extends its retracement.

$582,381,000,000 Added To US National Debt Since January As JPMorgan Chase CEO Issues Warning on America's Fiscal Future - The Daily Hodl


								The US has added well over half a trillion dollars to its national debt since the start of 2024 as the CEO of the world’s largest bank issues a warning on the state of America’s balance sheet.
According to new data from the Treasury, as of May 14th, the US national debt grew by $582.381 billion year-to-date, with interest on that debt surpassing spending on both national defense and Medicare.










The nation’s total outstanding debt now stands at $34.5 trillion.
In a new interview with Sky News, JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon says that much of the growth in the American economy in recent years is largely driven by borrowing.
But Dimon says the debt-to-GDP ratio, if unchecked, will become a major problem that’s much harder to deal with.
“America has spent a lot of money. And during Covid and after Covid our deficit is 6% now. That’s a lot, but obviously that drives growth. Any country can borrow money and drive some growth but it may not always lead to good growth so I think America should be quite aware that we have to focus on our fiscal deficit issues a little bit more, and that is important for the world…
I think it’s why we have higher inflation and sticky inflation, and I think if you want to do a great job in your country, and you have a 6% deficit and a 100% debt to GDP [ratio], this can go on for a while. But the sooner we focus on it, the better. So I’m hoping that the government really focuses on how can we reduce that deficit and still have good growth…
At one point it will cause a problem, and why should you wait? Because the problem will be caused by the market and then you’ll be forced to deal with it and probably in a far more uncomfortable way than if you had dealt with it to start.”
According to the Treasury Department, the US government has spent $855 billion more than it has collected in the 2024 fiscal year.
In 2023, the government’s total deficit spending reached $1.7 trillion.

Nvidia reports $26 billion Q1 revenue, AI crypto tokens show correlative gains - Crypto Briefing


            
            
                            
            
                            
            
            Chip-making tech behemoth Nvidia has announced its Q1 earnings, showing a record quarterly revenue of $26 billion, up by 5.5% of market expectations. The company has also confirmed that a ten-for-one forward stock split would be implemented by June 7, 2024. At the time of writing, the Nvidia stock ($NVDA) is up 2.6% after market close.On the crypto side, artificial intelligence-related tokens have seen notable gains, despite the muted performance of the broader digital asset market, with the exception of Ethereum’s recent gains.The uptick in AI token prices comes as investors prepared for the quarterly earnings report from chip-making giant Nvidia (NVDA). Nvidia’s report is widely viewed as the grand finale of a surprisingly strong earnings season for big tech companies. Looking ahead, Nvidia expects revenue of $28.0 billion for the second quarter of fiscal 2025, plus or minus 2%. The company also announced a 150% increase in its quarterly cash dividend. Several large-cap AI tokens have posted significant gains over the past 24 hours, according to data from CoinGecko. Fetch.ai’s FET, Render’s RNDR, Bittensor’s TAO, and SingularityNET’s AGIX have all advanced between 4% and 5%.Meanwhile, AIOZ Network’s token (AIOZ) has surged 7% following the announcement that Nvidia has listed the project on its Accelerated Applications Catalog, which allows users to search for tools and services built on Nvidia platforms.A merger between Fetch.AI, SingularityNET, and Ocean Protocol has also been approved by their communities, combining $FET, $AGIX, and $OCEAN into $ASI at anticipated total value of $7.5 billion. The native token of Near Protocol (NEAR), a layer-1 (L1) network that garnered attention when its co-founder spoke at an Nvidia conference earlier this year, has also seen a 2% gain. NEAR was the best-performing asset, which fell 0.6% alongside modest declines in both Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH).The overall market decline comes on the heels of a breakneck rally driven by positive regulatory developments in the US and falling bond yields as inflation concerns ease. Despite this, AI-focused tokens have managed to buck the trend and post gains.Nvidia’s earnings report is expected to confirm the enthusiasm surrounding AI and potentially offer a glimpse into the future for stocks. The company’s shares have soared more than 200% over the past 12 months, adding roughly $1.5 trillion in market value. With a market capitalization of $2.3 trillion, Nvidia’s weighting in the S&P 500 has increased from 2.2% to more than 5% in the past year.Other tech giants, such as Microsoft, Alphabet, Amazon, and Apple, have already reported strong earnings, showing that demand for AI services is helping to fuel revenue growth. These results have helped propel the S&P 500 Index to an all-time high.Investors have come to expect Nvidia to deliver blow-out earnings, with the company having topped profit and sales estimates by at least 15% in recent quarters. However, there are some concerns about the rollout of a new chip dubbed Blackwell later this year, which could lead customers to slow purchases of its predecessor until the new one is available.Despite these concerns, the performance of AI-focused tokens serves as a testament to the growing excitement surrounding the AI sector and its potential impact on the future of technology and finance.

Ethereum's Institutional Sell | Bankless


New Best? Laser-eyed Bitcoiners have long-maintained that their chosen asset is the only cryptocurrency institutions will be willing to purchase. With spot ETH ETFs on the horizon, will TradFi soon find a superior alternative?Bitcoin’s High Priest of HODLing, MicroStrategy founder Michael Saylor, had previously repudiated Ethereum on grounds that the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) would declare it – and by extension all non-BTC tokens – as crypto asset securities.Unfortunately for Saylor, impending approval of spot ETH ETFs opens the door for future spot ETF listings on any crypto asset that meet the murky definition of a commodity, eliminating BTC’s monopoly on TradFi access and forcing it to compete amongst other crypto assets in the free market for capital.
While many conformed to beliefs that BTC will be the only digital asset to be accepted by the masses, Ethereum remains highly attractive to institutional players due to the usefulness of the network and the presence of similar properties.Over half a dozen high profile financiers have lauded Ethereum and the use cases it enables, with numerous asset management firms launching their own tokenization experimentations to gain first hand experience with the Ethereum L1!Assuming spot ETH ETFs receive approval tomorrow, TradFi institutions will finally receive the tools they need to monetize their support of Ether, potentially compelling them to increase their adoption of Ethereum-native blockchain technology and advertise Ether to external capital.
Daily trading volumes on existing commodity futures-based Ether ETFs set new all-time highs twice this week, generating $47.8M in volume on Tuesday, a 40% increase from the previous all-time high set just the day before and a 7x increase from last week’s peak volume day.Ether futures ETF volumes may pale in comparison to the billions of dollars in daily volume processed by spot BTC ETFs, but they are not a distant cry from the volumes for BTC futures ETFs, which ranged around the $200M mark in recent weeks.Although increases in ETH futures ETF volumes certainly appear impressive on a percentage-adjusted basis, it is worth noting that they have merely rebounded off depressed levels of just a few million dollars in daily volume.Leading Bitcoin futures ETF BITO consistently processed over $500M in volume leading up to spot BTC ETF approval and achieved nearly $2B in volume one day prior to the main event; the chasm between BTC and ETH pre-spot ETF launch volume statistics makes it clear that TradFi participants are not speculating on the launch of spot ETH ETFs with the same amount of gusto as they exhibited for BTC’s spot debut.Despite the relative lack of enthusiasm for Ether ahead of tomorrow’s first final spot ETF decision deadline, an overwhelming denial sentiment heading into this week could have made bulls weary of taking this trade…Over $10B of ETH has been accumulated by the Grayscale Ethereum Trust (ETHE) and will become redeemable upon its conversion to a spot ETH ETF. Sell pressure from ETHE redemptions likely suppresses price in the near-term as it did for Bitcoin after GBTC unlocked in January, but many analysts remain bullish on the future trajectory of ETH price. Asset manager Bernstein claims that spot ETF approval will send Ether to $6.6k, meanwhile multinational bank Standard Chartered reiterated an $8k end-of-year target.

Uniswap Labs Responds to SEC Wells Notice, Calls the Legal Basis “Weak”


																Uniswap Labs, the company behind the decentralized exchange Uniswap, has issued a response to the Wells Notice from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.
Meanwhile, Uniswap’s native token UNI has surged 2.0% over the last 24 hours and 37% over the week to hit $9.48.
Uniswap Labs Criticizes SEC’s Legal Basis
In a blog post on May 21, Uniswap Labs criticized the SEC’s basis for the notice, calling it “weak.” The firm compiled a number of reasons why the agency’s pursuit of legal action needs to be reconsidered.
Uniswap noted that the SEC based the notice on the assumption that all tokens are securities. However, Marvin Ammori, the Uniswap Labs Chief Legal Officer, argued that tokens are a file format for value and not inherently securities. He went on to criticize the SEC’s efforts to redefine terms such as “exchange,” “broker,” and “investment contract” to include Uniswap’s operations.
Ammori also pointed out that the SEC’s accusation that Uniswap’s interface and wallet act as brokers would likely fail, citing a recent federal judge’s ruling dismissing similar claims against the Coinbase Wallet.




Uniswap has confirmed its readiness to engage in legal action and fight off any charges, saying that its lawyers have represented such cases, including Grayscale and Ripple, which were successful.
Uniswap lawyers warned that a case against Uniswap is bound to drive American crypto investors to use foreign trading protocols. Further, it could discourage future innovators from coming up with new ideas that bring competition and innovation in financial and commercial markets.
Response Comes as Crypto Regulation Bill Vote Nears
Uniswap Labs’ response comes just as the U.S. House of Representatives prepares to vote on the Financial Innovation and Technology for the 21st Century Act. The bill aims to reshape the regulatory roles of the SEC and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) regarding crypto.
According to Uniswap, if this legislation were enacted, the SEC’s case might become irrelevant, and the CFTC would gain enforcement authority in certain areas.
Uniswap received the Wells Notice in April, as confirmed on X by Ammori. He said that he was disappointed but not surprised. Further, he criticized the SEC for not having clarity and guidance on Uniswap’s self-custodial, non-intermediated products.
Coinbase also received a Wells Notice in March last year, which resulted in full-fledged lawsuits. Meanwhile, the SEC plans to bring legal action against Robinhood, a trading platform, in May.

"Total Nonsense": Scaramucci Defends Bitcoin Evangelist Saylor Against Critic


American financier Anthony Scaramucci, the founder and managing partner of New York-based investment firm SkyBridge Capital, has defended MicroStrategy co-founder Michael Saylor against a critic who has accused the latter of damaging Bitcoin more than helping it. Scaramucci slammed the caustic comment as "complete nonsense," adding that Saylor has been "Sherpa" for many of us. He added that the MicroStrategy co-founder was "the best explainer of Bitcoin" in the cryptocurrency community. Most cryptocurrency commentators have sided with Scaramucci, arguing that it would be ludicrous to view Saylor's influence as negative considering his dedication. However, there were also those who recalled how Saylor's Bitcoin advocacy sometimes went too far. Back in 2021, he famously advised his followers to mortgage their houses in order to buy more Bitcoin near the peak of the previous bullish cycle. In 2022, Saylor's remark came back to bite him during Bitcoin's price crash, with many followers accusing the controversial Bitcoin evangelist of leading them into financial ruin. As reported by U.Today, Saylor defended his controversial comment, claiming that the critics had cherry-picked his words. Saylor, who famously became the first person to lose $6 billion in a day during the dot-com bubble crash in 2000, managed to reinvent himself as one of the top Bitcoin proponents. After facing a lot of ridicule during the bear market, Saylor has defined his naysayers. MicroStrategy (MSTR) stock has seen a triple-digit rally this year due to the Bitcoin rally. Meanwhile, Saylor's net worth has surpassed $4 billion.

Milady NFTs Soar Amid NFT Market Volatility - The Defiant

Milady Maker NFTs have surged 35% as most Ethereum NFTs slumped.As ETH rallied over the past two days, traders sold off most major Ethereum NFT collections, such as Azuki and the Mutant Ape Yacht Club, but Miladies and related NFTs are bucking the trend.While most collections trended downwards or remained flat, the Milady floor price soared 35% from 4 ETH ($14,800) to a high of 5.8 ETH ($21,500) in a matter of hours. While there is no clear catalyst for the rally, the momentum has been sustained as the collection still sits at a 5.5 ETH floor.Top Ethereum NFTsThe Milady-adjacent NFT collection, Redacted Remilio Babies, also jumped 35%, increasing from 1.36 ETH to a high of 1.85 ETH before retracing.Periods of high volatility in the price of Ether can negatively affect NFT prices in the short term. Traders often prefer to be allocated to ETH rather than NFTs when they anticipate large price movements. This is typically due to fear of the NFT underperforming compared to the base asset, ETH.Milady Maker Floor PriceDespite previous controversy, Milady and Remilio NFTs have largely outperformed other ETH NFT collections since 2022, and both are currently at all-time highs.

&nbsp

&nbsp
With the growing anticipations of an Ethereum ETF approval, the entire crypto market is on a bull run. As the altcoins pick up pace, meme coins display impressive rallies within 48 hours.



Further, with the Bitcoin and Ethereum ETPs getting listing approval on the London Stock Exchange, the bulls are supercharged. Will this bull market sustain an uptrend for a massive jump in meme coins?



Don’t worry. We’ve got our top pick of meme coins that are likely to explode before the Ethereum Spot ETF approval.



PEPE (PEPE)



With the bull run spreading like wildfire in the crypto market, the PEPE price spearheads the bull run in the meme coin sector. The PEPE price is constantly rising as a frog-themed coin in a canine-dominated market.







With a massive jump of almost 50% during the Ethereum bull run, the PEPE price is trading at an all-time high of $0.0000136. Further, the meme coin shows the rounding bottom breakout rally gaining momentum.

&nbsp



The trend-based Fibonacci retracement shows that the PEPE price could easily scale to hit $0.000027 amidst the growing market. 



Floki (FLOKI)



Following the bullish breakout of a double bottom pattern and a falling wedge pattern, the meme coin prepares for a massive surge. The FLOKI price has increased by almost 20% with two immensely bullish candles. 







The Stochastic RSI average lines enter the overbought zone, and the crucial 50, 100, and 200-day EMAs are in a bullish alignment. Thus, the technical indicators bolster the continuation of the bullish trend.



As per the Fibonacci levels, the bull run could reach the 1.618 Fibonacci level at the $0.00040 mark.



Dogwifhat (WIF)



With a bullish trend in motion, the WIF price sustained above a crucial support trendline in the 1D chart. This meme coin is on the verge of a massive bull run as it prepares a triangle breakout.







With the WIF price challenging the overhead resistance trendline, the sideline traders anticipate a surge in buying pressure. Further, the bullish crossover in the MACD and Vortex indicators bolsters the possibility of a bull run.



As per the trend-based Fibonacci retracement, the 2.618 level at $9.29 is a potential upside target.



Shiba Inu (SHIB)



With a market cap of 15.29 Billion dollars, Shiba Inu ranks as the second biggest meme coin in the crypto world. The meme coin has increased by almost 10% since the buzz of Ethereum ETF started in the market.







Further, the SHIB price action shows a triangle breakout rally ready to gain bullish momentum. The meme coin sustains above the 20D EMA and is ready to challenge the $0.00002750 mark.



As the RSI line approaches the overbought zone, the SHIB price could shortly give another breakout entry. An uptrend continuation in Shiba Inu might reach the $0.00005378 mark.



Book of Meme (BOME)



Finally, the Book of MEME or the BOME token is starting to siphon momentum from the recovering market. The recovery rally in the BOME price is starting with a trendline breakout.







The bullish reversal crossed above the 50% Fibonacci level and jumped almost 20% in the last 48 hours. According to the Fibonacci levels, the uptrend continuation in BOME can target $0.037.

Promising Plays to Double-Down on ETH | Bankless


Ethereum is catching a major bid as the market adjusts to an eleventh-hour resurgence in optimism around the chances of approval for the first ETH spot ETFs!With ETH climbing more than 25% in the past week, it’s clear traders are looking to up their exposure to the asset. Investors are also bidding up assets across the EVM ecosystem that they see as beta plays on potential ETF approval.Today, we’re looking at some of the plays already catching fire, and the tokens and ecosystems that could be poised to take off at any moment 👀Ethereum ETF Approval Incoming? on BanklessAfter months of bearishness, is an 11th hour reversal coming from the SEC?Established ETH TokensWhile many major ETH ecosystem tokens have underperformed ETH for months, shifting winds may push investors to look for unrecognized upside.
💦 LDOLido’s governance token, netted a ~25% boost off of ETF approval rumors, showing how integral the protocol and its LST, stETH, remain to the ecosystem despite declining market share. While EigenLayer's restaking push has threatened to reshape the power dynamics of the staking landscape, LDO and competitors like RocketPool's RPL remain much-aped plays.
🧑‍💻 ENSThe governance token of Ethereum Name Service has pumped 50% on the back of broader market games and a notable Vitalik endorsement, who questioned why more people weren't paying attention to what he called Ethereum’s most successful non-financial application. 
🥏 ARBAmid the rise of fresh L2 competitors, Arbitrum has continued to shine with the largest TVL of all L2s. This strength has not always been reflected in its token but ARB has climbed  in the aftermath of the ETF news. Home to leading DeFi protocols like GMX and Pendle and being the primary infrastructure for L3s, Arbitrum sits securely at the top of the L2 ecosystem.♻️ ETHFIEther.fi's governance token, ETHFI, caught a bid on the ETF news, rising ~20% in the following 24 hours. As a non-custodial liquid restaking protocol, ether.fi allows users to stake assets while retaining control over their private keys, receiving eETH in return. Being the largest LRT by TVL provides ether.fi credibility as an established player in restaking, one whose demand is further solidified by its ties to Pendle and the second season of its points program.🤡 MemesLooking to go more degen in your bets? While Base and Solana have been the primary memecoin arenas of this cycle, there are still some major players on mainnet. Just take a look at some established ETH memes like PEPE, BITCOIN, or MOG, which are up ~30%, ~40%, and ~50%, respectively, over the past couple days.
🖼️ ETH-Native NFTsNFTs have been tricky this cycle, with most blue-chip collections underperforming the market or collapsing altogether. Yuga's assets have been dropping for months, but even the stalwart CryptoPunks saw their floor dip below 35 ETH this week for the first time since 2021.Meanwhile, the most promising ETH NFTs performers have been PFPs that didn't moon during the 2021 cycle, including collections like like Miladys, Remilios, Mocaverse and, shockingly, Pixelmon, which have seen double-digit jumps in their ETH-denominated floor prices this week despite ETH's pump. Overall, the price action suggests more interest in grass-roots communities with more open ocean ahead of them, compared to projects that have already raised venture funding or are deep into complicated roadmaps.via NFTPriceFloor🔵 BaseYes, there's not a native token (yet), but betting on Base could still be a solid play. Despite stagnating TVL growth, Base continues to offer a convincing narrative as a the consumer L2 hub for Ethereum. Activity and related assets has been pumping since rumors of an SEC reversal on the ETF decision caught fire. Leading ecosystem tokens like DEGEN are up around ~30% this week, with PRIME also up ~20%. Memecoins have performed even better, with some netting three-figure gains. Make Your BetsThe potential approval of an Ethereum ETF has added to the market’s exuberance, boosting established ETH tokens, ETH-native NFTs, and Ethereum’s popular L2s.While nothing is certain until the SEC makes its final calls on ETF applications, savvy ETH investors know where Ethereum is going in the long-term and should be loading up their bags accordingly.

House Passes FIT21 Bill To Provide Crypto Legal Clarity With Two Thirds Majority


																The U.S. House of Representatives passed legislation on Monday that will provide long-sought-after legal clarity around how crypto assets should be classified, registered, and custodied.
The bill, titled the Financial Innovation and Technology for the 21st Century Act (FIT21), received near unanimous support from Republicans alongside 71 additional votes from Democrats, resulting in a final tally of 279 ‘yea’ to 136 ‘nay’.
A ‘Historic’ Step For Crypto Regulation
Crypto industry leaders widely praised the legislation as a first step towards clear, fit-for-purpose rules pertaining to digital asset trading and registration.
“Americans want to know their representatives are protecting their rights to use crypto, creating clear rules to protect consumers, and won’t let the lack of clarity be weaponized by a few activists in the administration trying to unlawfully kill an industry,” tweeted Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong on Wednesday, before the vote.
According to one of the bill’s authors, French Hill (R-AR), the legislation includes an interim oversight process for digital asset firms whereby they may file a ‘notice of intent to register’ with federal regulators as rules around how agencies divvy responsibility of the industry are finalized.
“This bill imposes strict consumer protections that do not allow commingling of customer funds,” added Hill, noting that it would help prevent another FTX-like collapse.




It also helps clarify which digital assets should be regulated by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) versus the Commodities and Futures Trading Commission (CFTC), both of which have bickered over their rightful jurisdiction of the industry for years.
What Democrats Think Of FIT21
Contrary to the bill’s Republican supporters, Democrats on the House Financial Services Committee said the bill would benefit “wealthy crypto firms that have chosen not to register with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC),” while hurting “ordinary investors trying to build wealth.”
SEC chairman Gary Gensler also criticized the bill, claiming that the laws on the books are sufficient to regulate crypto, and that the industry simply refuses to comply with them. “We should make the policy choice to protect the investing public over facilitating business models of non-compliant firms,” he argued.
A significant number of Democrats supported the bill, however, urging their party members to do the same to help the nation keep pace with rivals on crypto regulation and progress. “This is not a perfect bill, but I believe it is a good step in the right direction,” said Rep. Yadira Caraveo (D-CO) on the matter.
The Biden administration said that it opposed FIT21 prior to the vote, but that it would work with Congress on a “comprehensive and balanced regulatory framework for digital assets.”
Notably, the administration did not signal intent to veto the bill should it pass through both chambers, as done with recent crypto legislation around crypto banking. As with FIT21, the legislation passed the House with bipartisan support.

White House Won’t Veto Passage of FIT21 Despite Opposition From SEC Chair Gary Gensler - The Daily Hodl


								The White House has signalled it won’t veto the passage of the FIT21 bill despite U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission Chair Gary Gensler advocating against it.
In a new press release, the White House says it does not support HR 4763, also known as the Financial Innovation and Technology for the 21st Century Act (FIT21), as it currently “lacks sufficient protections for consumers and investors who engage in certain digital asset transactions.”










However, the administration says that even though it opposes the bill, it is willing to work with Congress to improve it.
“The Administration opposes passage of H.R. 4763, which would affect the regulatory structure for digital assets in the United States… 
The Administration looks forward to continued collaboration with Congress on developing legislation for digital assets that includes adequate guardrails for consumers and investors while creating the conditions needed for innovation, and further time will be needed for such collaboration.”
The bill, which would give power to the Commodity Futures and Trading Commission (CFTC) to regulate digital assets as commodities if the blockchain they run on is sufficiently decentralized, is slated to be voted on later this week.
In a message from the SEC, Chair Gensler voices his dissent of the bill, saying that it would create numerous regulatory gaps, undermining current securities laws.
“It is through the securities laws that we get full, fair, and truthful disclosure that arms investors with the information they need to make investment decisions and enables regulators to guard against the types of fraud we’ve seen in the crypto field. 
The crypto industry’s record of failures, frauds, and bankruptcies is not because we don’t have rules or because the rules are unclear. It’s because many players in the crypto industry don’t play by the rules. We should make the policy choice to protect the investing public over facilitating business models of noncompliant firms.”

Black Phoenix (BPX) Emerges As The Crypto King With Mind-Blowing 4,000,000% Growth In 24 Hours


																The crypto industry has been dominated by the recovery of major cryptocurrencies and regulatory developments, but one unexpected player has taken the market by storm. Black Phoenix, a payment system protocol, and its native token, BPX, have witnessed an astonishing surge in price, outperforming the entire market with historical performance.
Notably, Black Phoenix’s BPX token reached an all-time high of $2.60 on May 22, propelled by a staggering 4,400,000% growth in the past 24 hours and over 6,500,000% in the past fourteen days.

This unexpected victory has caught the attention of investors, prompting them to examine the protocol’s underlying principles and design more closely.
Exploring The Black Phoenix Design
According to the protocol’s “Black Paper” released in April 2021, Black Phoenix presents a fully on-chain liquidity protocol for instant cryptocurrency token swaps in a decentralized manner on any smart contract-enabled blockchain. 
The protocol’s design aggregates liquidity within each blockchain, claiming to offer “the best rates” for takers executing trades. Additionally, Black Phoenix envisions a connected liquidity network facilitating seamless cross-chain token swaps across its networks on different chains, with its token based on the Tron (TRX) blockchain.

To implement a distributed infrastructure services economy, Black Phoenix introduced its native token BPX. BPX aims to eliminate “inefficiencies” in the existing protocol and attract a broad user base, ultimately creating a marketplace for distributed infrastructure services.
Black Phoenix’s long-term and short-term goals revolve around achieving reputable exchange listings, increasing the token’s value, and expanding the user base. 
Currently, BPX tokens can be traded on centralized crypto exchanges. The most popular exchange to buy and trade Black Phoenix is FameEX, where the most active trading pair BPX/USDT has a trading volume of $2,809,201 in the last 24 hours, which has been the propeller of the current uptrend.

Nevertheless, Black Phoenix plans to list the BPX token on several exchanges, including Hotbit, Hitbtc, Coinex, Binance, and Coinbase Pro. 
Trading Volume Skyrockets 2,800,000%
One key indicator of Black Phoenix’s recent success is the increase in trading volume. CoinGecko data shows a significant spike in trading volume for BPX on Wednesday, reaching 2,800,000%. 
At the same time, Black Phoenix’s market capitalization has risen to $3.8 billion, a significant increase from $29 million in hours. 
The fully diluted valuation (FDV) is a statistical representation of the maximum market capitalization an asset can achieve, assuming that all available tokens are in circulation. 
For Black Phoenix, the FDV currently stands at an impressive $10.4 billion. This valuation represents the potential growth and market cap of BPX if all 4 billion tokens were in circulation. 
Following the notable surge in all key metrics for BPX, the project’s team has made a bold prediction, stating that BPX will soon become one of the top 5 cryptocurrencies in the world.

Ultimately, the potential listing of Black Phoenix’s token on top exchanges promises to propel its upward trend further. However, as is typical for all cryptocurrencies, the extent of its surge and the subsequent occurrence of a market correction remains uncertain.

Fed Pivot Could Release $6 Trillion into Crypto to Boost BTC, ETH, XRP, ADA, and More | Cryptoglobe


                                
Wall Street analysts are eyeing a potential turning point in Federal Reserve policy, with some predicting a seismic shift that could ignite a multi-trillion-dollar surge in the cryptocurrency market.



This bullish outlook hinges on the Fed successfully taming inflation, potentially unleashing an estimated $6 trillion in sidelined capital back into the market, according to a recent Forbes report. Some of that capital could move into the cryptocurrency space and boost assets like BTC, ETH, and XRP.



Tom Lee, managing partner at Fundstrat Global Advisors, has revealed he envisions a transformative event, a once-in-a-generation opportunity as if the Fed signals victory over inflation, Lee suggests trillions of dollars could flood back into the market within months.



Lee’s optimism rests on recent signs of progress. The April Consumer Price Index (CPI) showed a deceleration, rising 0.3% compared to 0.4% in March, which suggests the Fed’s aggressive monetary policy may be paying off.











            
            

            
            

            
            

        

Should the Fed pivot, Lee believes a frenzy of investment activity could erupt and the price of Bitcoin could potentially skyrocket to $150,000, more than double its current price of around $71,000. Historically, other major cryptocurrencies like XRP have followed similar trajectories.



Earlier this week, the price of Ethereum soared more than 20% in a single day as the cryptocurrency market added over $200 billion, in a surge triggered by news elated to the potential approval of spot Ether exchange-traded funds (ETFs) in the U.S.



These came after the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) abruptly requested that the exchanges that want to list and trade these funds update key filings related to these products, fueling speculation that the regulator is considering approving these products.



A major cryptocurrency analysts are eyeing is XRP, which has struggled to regain its former highs after its legal battle with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) started. The cryptocurrency could be a beneficiary from the potential $6 trillion in capital that could flow into the cryptocurrency space.

The Financial Innovation and Technology for the 21st Century Act Is a Watershed Moment for Our Industry

For too long, the regulatory landscape for digital assets in the United States has been an untenable, muddled mess. Different federal agencies have asserted conflicting jurisdiction, creating confusion and uncertainty in the marketplace. Meanwhile, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has taken advantage of this precarious situation, supercharging a campaign of intimidation and enforcement that threatens the viability of crypto in the U.S.

Crypto Lobby Wins: House Passes FIT21 as Democrats Deride Historic Regulatory Framework - Decrypt

Lawmakers voted Wednesday in favor of a crypto market structure bill that could have a sweeping impact on the U.S. regulatory backdrop for digital assets if it eventually becomes law.Dubbed the Financial Innovation and Technology for the 21st Century Act, or FIT21, the measure was approved by the House of Representatives with a 279-136 vote. With 208 Republican members of the House voting in favor of the bill, 71 Democrats voted in favor of FIT21 as well. All but three of 217 Republican House members voted in favor of FIT21, while about a third of Democrats supported the measure too.The bipartisan push behind FIT21 encapsulates shifting attitudes towards crypto on Capitol Hill. Just last week, a measure rolling back crypto custody rules for banks from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) passed both the House and Senate, receiving support from notable lawmakers like Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY).The bill passed by the House on Wednesday creates a federal framework for the regulation of digital assets, establishing jurisdiction between the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) and SEC. Giving issuers the ability to self-certify assets as digital commodities, among other initiatives, the bill was skewered Wednesday by SEC Chair Gary Gensler.Among those that vocalized discontent for the bill was also President Joe Biden, who called out a lack of sufficient protections for investors in written remarks. Still, Biden in his Wednesday letter called for a “comprehensive and balanced regulatory framework” for digital assets, suggesting that the status quo is currently lacking.Curtailing the SEC’s regulatory remit, FIT21 gives the CFTC exclusive regulatory authority over digital asset commodities. Under the bill, criteria is provided for determining that status based on a project’s level of decentralization, looking at factors such as how much of a token’s supply a party owns or a blockchain’s susceptibility to influence from a single party.Hours before the bill was put to a House vote, members of the Chamber debated FIT21’s merits. Among the bill’s cosponsors, House Financial Services Committee (HSFC) Chairman Patrick McHenry (R-SC) said, “The SEC and the CFTC are currently in a food fight for control of this asset class class.”"They've created an impossible situation where the same firms are subject to competing and contradictory enforcement actions by the two different agencies, leaving consumers behind, leaving innovators behind," he continued. "FIT21 fixes this."However, several Democrats, including Rep. Maxine Waters, blasted the bill. "This bill still provides major exemptions from critical securities laws," she said. She later said that crypto companies are "refusing to register," and that the bill would "exonerate" them and "give them the opportunity to operate without regulation.""How can this happen?" she said.Brad Sherman (D-CA) said that changes under the bill to the definition of a security would serve as a "dagger at the hundred trillion dollar markets that power our economy." Additionally, he raised concerns about crypto users evading taxes or sanctions if the technology was policed with a light touch.Meanwhile, Sean Casten (D-IL) pointed to reports regarding the use of cryptocurrency by terrorist groups and to in the child sexual abuse material (CSAM) trade. "The bad guys love crypto," he said.Clarifying authority between the CFTC and SEC has been a long-held hope within the crypto industry as advocates have said existing rules are unclear. And FIT21 addresses several areas within crypto, including the treatment of trading platforms, decentralized finance, and how developers can raise funds for projects.The passage of FIT21 comes after years of squabbling on Capitol Hill over other crypto bills, such as measures to regulate stablecoins. Last year, House Republicans established a subcommittee on digital assets with the explicit goal of creating clearer crypto rules.Introduced by McHenry as a crypto "OG," Rep. Warren Davidson (R-OH) said that crypto legislation was long overdue after working for six years on other crypto measures. Davidson said he began working on crypto rules in 2018, starting with the Token Taxonomy Act."For too long we have pushed innovation and investment in digital asset projects overseas as Congress has constantly failed to bring the clarity that we need," he said. "We finally have the chance to end this trend and solidify ourselves as the leaders in this industry."As the bill moves next to the Democrat-controlled Senate, it could face insurmountable hurdles before reaching Biden's desk. However, the crypto-friendly Senator Cynthia Lummis (R-WY) suggested on Twitter (aka X) that lawmakers there could rally behind FIT21 with bipartisan support.”There is a bipartisan majority in both chambers of Congress in favor of crypto," she said. "The future is very bright."Edited by Guillermo Jimenez and Andrew HaywardDaily Debrief NewsletterStart every day with the top news stories right now, plus original features, a podcast, videos and more.

U.S. House Approves Crypto FIT21 Bill With Wave of Democratic Support

"We need rules of the road," said Rep. Josh Gottheimer (D-N.J.), one of the Democrats who bucked the opposition of the White House and the ranking Democrat on the House Financial Services Committee, Rep. Maxine Waters (D-Calif.). He called it "well-reasoned, thoughtful, bipartisan legislation" and argued before the vote that "it's fit to become law if we work together."

BREAKING: FIT21 Bill, Favorable for Cryptocurrencies, Passed the US House of Representatives Vote - Bitcoin Sistemi


According to the latest development, the FIT21 bill, which is positive for cryptocurrencies, was voted in the House of Representatives.
The bill, called FIT21, would give the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) more spot market authority over digital assets considered commodities, while also creating new lines of jurisdiction for the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).


Crypto companies and digital asset issuers will have a framework for determining whether and how their assets qualify as securities under the terms defined in the bill, allowing them to know who their primary regulators may be.
The bill's path in the Senate is less clear, and the White House said early Wednesday it opposes the legislation, but President Joe Biden has not threatened a veto.

Audrey Tang: Learning From Taiwan’s Digital Civic Experimentation

Chapter 2-2, has a very comprehensive response, saying that, and I quote, “As a decentralized, citizen-led community, vTaiwan is also a living organism that naturally evolves and adapts as citizen volunteers participate in various ways. The community’s engagement experienced a downturn following the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, which interrupted face-to-face meetings and led to decreased participation. The platform faced challenges due to the intensive volunteering effort required, the absence of mandates for governmental responses, and its somewhat narrow focus. In response to these challenges, vTaiwan’s community has sought to find a new role between the public and the government and extend its outreach beyond the realm of Taiwanese regulation in recent years. A significant effort to revitalize vTaiwan was its collaboration with OpenAI’s Democratic Input to AI project in 2023. Through partnerships with Chatham House and the organization of several physical and online deliberative events centered on the topic of AI ethics and localization, vTaiwan successfully integrated local perspectives into the global discourse on AI and technology governance.”

Alex Labs Recovers $3.9 Million in Crypto from BNB Smart Chain Bridge Exploit



                    

Bitcoin layer-2 developer Alex Labs has successfully frozen over $3.9 million worth of cryptocurrency exploited from its BNB Smart Chain bridge, according to a May 16 social media post. 



The team stated that the attacker sent the funds to various centralized exchanges (CEXs), enabling the funds to be frozen with the cooperation of these exchanges.




The team announced that it recovered the entire balances for 17 different tokens, including “all aBTC, sUSDT, xBTC, xUSD, ALEX, atALEX, LiSTX, LUNR, SKO, CHAX, $B20, ORDG, ORMM, ORNJ, TRIO, TX20 and STXS.”



Additionally, $13.7 million worth of Stacks (STX) tokens were exploited. Of these, the attacker mistakenly sent “about 3 million” to centralized exchanges. 



A linked spreadsheet shows STX balances at each exchange used by the hacker, revealing that $3.7 million is held at exchanges, while $9.6 million remains in wallets under the attacker’s control.



The attacker accessed the funds by taking control of a private key linked to one of the bridge’s “vaults.” 



However, “The smart contract code and infrastructure underlying ALEX were not compromised,” the team asserted.



Alex Labs has offered a 10% bounty to the attacker and a promise not to prosecute if they return 90% of the stolen funds.

They are also preparing a police report to be filed if negotiations fail.



Given the possibility that not all funds will be recovered, the team is “evaluating deployment of $ALEX reserves held by ALEX Lab Foundation.” 




These reserves may support a “treasury grant program” to compensate users who lost funds in the attack.



Due to the significant amount of STX tokens exploited, the team may propose a Stacks network upgrade to freeze the remaining funds and mint new tokens for the victims.



Network upgrades to freeze an attacker’s coins are rare but not unprecedented. Similar actions were taken during the 2016 Ethereum DAO hack and the PopcornSwap rug pull on the BNB Smart Chain. 



However, such upgrades are rarely approved, and in the PopcornSwap case, the upgrade froze funds but did not reimburse investors.



Alex Labs stated it continues to monitor the attacker’s addresses with “multiple alarms” to prevent further cash outs.



Recently, Alex Labs is not the only Bitcoin layer-2 bridge attacked. On May 17, the XLink bridge was also compromised, losing $10 million. 



A white-hat hacker managed to recover $4.3 million of the stolen funds. 



The XLink attack mirrored the one against Alex, with the attacker using a phishing technique to obtain the team’s private key for unauthorized withdrawals.

XRP's rally hits major roadblock: What will the altcoin do now? - AMBCrypto



XRP tumbled as Ripple moved 50 million tokens, causing a market stir.
The overall market sentiment for XRP is mixed, with neither the bulls nor the bears in control.

Ripple’s [XRP] recent price surge hit a wall, leaving investors questioning what’s stalling its momentum. The cryptocurrency saw a promising 6% rise yesterday but has decreased by 2% today. 
What exactly is dragging XRP down?
Why is XRP down today?
Recent data from the blockchain tracker Whale Alert revealed a massive transfer of 50 million XRP tokens from Ripple Labs Inc. to an unknown wallet valued at approximately $25.7 million. 
This large-scale movement follows another huge transaction last week, in which over 100 million XRP were sent to an external wallet.
Typically, these Ripple dumps tend to shake XRP’s price negatively. This is because they increase the supply of XRP in the market, which can lead to downward pressure on the price if demand remains constant. 
And it has — XRP crossed the $0.55 threshold less than 24 hours ago, but the token is worth $0.53 at press time.
What does the market tell us?
AMBCrypto’s look at Coinglass’ data revealed that XRP’s trading volume has increased slightly by 3.68%, totaling $1.41 billion, indicating a moderate rise in trading activity. 
However, Open Interest has decreased by 2.93%. This decrease suggested a slight cooling off in market enthusiasm or a consolidation phase.
Source: Coinglass
The Long/Short Ratio across platforms showed a mix of bullish and bearish sentiments. These mixed signals suggested a cautious sentiment among traders and investors.
The contrast in Long/Short Ratios imply that while some top traders are bullish, the broader market remains divided. If the top traders’ bullish bets prove correct, we might see an upward price movement for XRP.
Meanwhile, AMBCrypto’s look at the social sentiment data revealed that the Ripple Fear and Greed Index stood at 54% at press time, which indicated a neutral market sentiment for XRP.

Dogecoin ETFs Move To The Fore: Can Positive Sentiment Drive It To $0.35? | Bitcoinist.com


								The idea of a Dogecoin (DOGE) exchange-traded fund (ETF) has been raised again. This is partly due to the positive sentiment around a potential approval of the Spot Ethereum ETFs, which crypto experts believe could open the door for other crypto funds. 
The Odds For A Dogecoin ETF Are “Brighter Than Ever”
Crypto venture capitalist (VC) Andrew Kang mentioned in an X (formerly Twitter) post that “the odds for a DOGE ETF look brighter than ever,” with regulatory clarity for the crypto industry looking to be imminent. Kang was referring to the Financial Innovation and Technology for the 21st Century (FIT21) bill, which aims to bestow crypto regulation upon the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC). 

This isn’t the first time Kang has discussed the possibility of a Dogecoin ETF being approved. In March, the crypto expert mentioned that there was a 30% chance that an investment fund related to the foremost meme coin would be eventually approved. He alluded to the recent regulatory developments as a reason why he had such hopes. 
Furthermore, he highlighted Donald Trump winning the presidency and Dogecoin being the “most decentralized” altcoin as factors that could aid in approving a DOGE ETF. Meanwhile, in January, he mentioned that Dogecoin is one of the biggest market cap coins that has never had a presale and has never been considered a security, which is why it deserved its own ETF. 
Kang also looks more confident about a Dogecoin ETF being approved thanks to the recent development, which shows that the SEC will likely approve the Spot Ethereum ETFs. He mentioned in a recent X post that “it is possible that an ETH ETF approval is not just an isolated event” but a first step of a “complete U-Turn” in the government’s anti-crypto stance. 
Crypto expert Anthony Pompliano also believes that a Spot Ethereum ETF approval could be the beginning of great things for the crypto industry. He stated in an X post that “they are approving the entire industry” if they approve the Ethereum ETF. “This is the last dam to be broken,” he claimed. 
This Positive Sentiment Can Drive DOGE To New Highs
There is no doubt that Dogecoin’s price could rise to new highs if the launch of a Dogecoin ETF becomes feasible. It has become evident how positively a crypto’s price can react just to the hype around the potential approval of an ETF, as seen with Bitcoin’s price before when the Spot Bitcoin ETFs were approved. 

More recently, Ethereum’s price rallied on news that the SEC had made a U-turn and was willing to approve the Spot Ethereum ETFs. Therefore, DOGE’s price can be expected to experience a significant price surge if an application is made to the SEC to launch a Dogecoin ETF.

Venezuela Bans Crypto Mining Amid Power Supply Concerns and Anti-Corruption Efforts



                    

The Venezuelan government has joined the ranks of countries that have opposed crypto mining due to its significant electricity consumption.



A local news outlet reports that Venezuela’s Ministry of Electric Power plans to disconnect cryptocurrency mining farms from the national grid. 




This initiative aims to regulate excessive energy use and ensure a stable power supply for the population.



An X post from Venezuela’s National Association of Cryptocurrencies confirmed that crypto mining is now prohibited in Venezuela.



This development follows a recent crackdown in which authorities confiscated 2,000 cryptocurrency mining devices in Maracay as part of an anti-corruption effort.



The ministry highlighted the necessity of providing efficient and reliable electrical service across Venezuela by reducing the strain from high-energy-consuming mining farms. 



Officials argue that these measures are crucial to stabilizing the national power supply, which has been inconsistent for the past decade.



Venezuela has faced recurring blackouts, especially since 2019, severely affecting residents’ daily lives and the broader economy.



Cryptocurrency mining’s heavy electricity demands have prompted other countries, such as China and Kazakhstan, to enforce strict regulations or bans on the practice.




READ MORE: Notorious Crypto Drainer Pink Drainer Retires After Stealing Over $85 Million



The Venezuelan government’s action against cryptocurrency mining is part of a broader anti-corruption campaign, which has resulted in the arrest of several top officials. 




Joselit Ramírez, the former head of the National Superintendency of Cryptoassets, is a central figure in these corruption allegations.



Rafael Lacava, the governor of Carabobo state, has emphasized the importance of public cooperation in identifying illegal mining operations, urging citizens to report any illicit activities.



This is not Venezuela’s first measure against crypto mining. 



In March 2023, the country’s energy supplier shut down crypto mining facilities nationwide as part of corruption investigations involving the state oil company.



At that time, Venezuela’s attorney general, Tarek William Saab, revealed that government officials were allegedly conducting parallel oil operations with the help of the national crypto department.



In 2023, eight major cryptocurrency mining operators in Kazakhstan sent an open letter to President Kassym-Jomart Tokayev, complaining about high energy prices for crypto miners.

AMD Chips Can Now Do The AI Work That Nvidia Tech Does - Decrypt

Lately, it seems like it's Nvidia world, and everyone—and certainly anyone in tech and the explosive AI industry—is living in it. Between its well-timed market entry, leading-edge hardware research, and a robust software ecosystem tailored for its GPUs, the company dominates AI development and the stock market. Its latest earnings report late today revealing that quarterly sales tripled, boosting its share price even higher.Nonetheless, long-time rival chipmaker AMD is still pushing hard to establish a foothold in AI, telling the builders behind the key technologies in the nascent space that they can also do their work on AMD hardware."I just wanted to remind everybody that if you're using PyTorch, TensorFlow or JAX, you can use your notebooks or scripts, they'll just run on AMD,” declared AMD senior director Ian Ferreira at the Microsoft Build 2024 conference earlier on Wednesday. “Same with inferencing engines. BLLM and Onyx also work out of the box."The company used its time on stage to show examples of how AMD GPUs can natively run powerful AI models like Stable Diffusion, and Microsoft Phi, efficiently performing computationally-intensive training tasks without depending on Nvidia's technology or hardware.Conference host Microsoft bolstered the message by announcing the availability of AMD-based virtual machines on its Azure cloud computing platform, using the company's accelerated MI300X GPUs. The chips were announced last June, began shipping in the new year, and were recently implemented in Microsoft Azure's OpenAI service and Hugging Face's infrastructure.ML Libraries Supported by AMD. Image: Microsoft. YoutubeNvidia's proprietary CUDA technology, which includes a full programming model and API designed specifically for Nvidia GPUs, has become the industry standard for AI development. AMD's main message, therefore, was that its solutions could slot right into the same workflows.Seamless compatibility with existing AI systems could be a game-changer, as developers can now leverage AMD's less costly hardware without overhauling their codebase.“Of course, we understand that you need more than just frameworks, you need a bunch of upstream stuff, you need a bunch of experimentation stuff, distributed training—all of that is enabled and works on AMD,” Ferreira assured.He then demonstrated how AMD handles different tasks, from running small models like ResNet 50 and Phi-3 to fine tuning and training GPT-2—all using the same code that Nvidia cards run.Image: Microsoft. YoutubeOne of the key advantages AMD touted is the ability to handle large language models efficiently.“You can load up to 70 billion parameters on one GPU, with eight of those on this instance,” he explained. “You can have eight different llama 70B's loaded, or take a big model like Llama-3 400Bn and deploy that on a single instance.”Challenging Nvidia's dominance is no easy feat, as the Santa Clara, Calif.-based company has fiercely protected its turf. Nvidia has already taken legal action against projects attempting to provide CUDA compatibility layers for third-party GPUs like AMD's, arguing that it violates CUDA's terms of service. This has limited the development of open-source solutions and made it harder for developers to embrace alternatives.AMD's strategy to circumvent Nvidia's blockade is to leverage its open-source ROCm framework, which competes directly with CUDA. The company has been making significant strides in this regard, partnering with Hugging Face, the world's largest repository of open-source AI models, to provide support for running code on AMD hardware.This partnership has already yielded promising results, with AMD offering native support and additional acceleration tools like ONNX models execution on ROCm-powered GPUs, Optimum-Benchmark, DeepSpeed for ROCm-powered GPUs using Transformers, GPTQ, TGI, and more.Ferreira also pointed out that this integration is native, eliminating the need for third-party solutions or middlemen that could make processes less efficient.“You can take your existing notebooks, your existing scripts, and you can run them on AMD, and that's important, because a lot of the other accelerators require transcoding and all kinds of pre-compiling scripts,” he said. “Our stuff just works out of the box—and it's really, really fast.”While AMD's move is undoubtedly bold, dethroning Nvidia will be a considerable challenge. Nvidia is not resting on its laurels, continuously innovating and making it difficult for developers to migrate to a new infrastructure from the de-facto CUDA standard.However, with its open-source approach, strategic partnerships, and a focus on native compatibility, AMD is positioning itself as a viable alternative for developers seeking more options in the AI hardware market.Edited by Ryan Ozawa.Generally Intelligent NewsletterA weekly AI journey narrated by Gen, a generative AI model.

PEPE has received a lot of hate and praise in the past. The questionable composition of holders was a huge red flag for the meme asset that killed off the momentum it was gaining in early 2024. However, as time went by and funds were redistributed, PEPE received a chance to recover and went for it.In recent days, PEPE has surged by an impressive 175%. The reason behind that rally is most likely a part of the improving sentiment among traders and investors. The momentum on PEPE is enormous, almost every single resistance has been broken, and it is unclear what could stop it, unless profit-taking is in place.PEPE/USDT Chart by TradingViewThe moving averages on the chart provide further insights. The 50-day moving average (blue line) has crossed above the 200-day moving average (orange line), forming a "golden cross." This is typically seen as a bullish indicator, suggesting that the current uptrend could continue. Additionally, the volume of trades has been high, reinforcing the bullish sentiment.Moving averages are currently offering an additional insight. With the golden cross intact, bullish PEPE holders might start increasing their positions, which is expected to push its value even further. The volume is also there, which creates a good foundation for the price.The Relative Strength Index (RSI) is currently at 72, indicating that PEPE is in overbought territory. Of course, it may cause a potential pullback but is unlikely to affect the situation in the long term, as RSI tends to dive and surge quite often.Bitcoin's chances at $70,000Despite the excitement, Bitcoin could not sustain its value above $70,000. It has now dipped below this anticipated threshold. Currently, BTC is trading around $69,700. There is always a chance for a rebound. Here's why.Bitcoin recently reached the $70,000 mark. It was unable to hold onto it, slipping below that level. However, there are reasons to believe it could make a comeback.On-chain metrics: Data indicates that 97% of BTC holders are seeing profits at this price point. This suggests that many long term investors are doing well financially, creating a foundation that may prevent significant sell-offs.Whale concentration: Eleven percent of BTC ownership belongs to large holders, known as "whales." This lower concentration helps mitigate the risk of large scale sell-offs that could impact prices negatively.Transaction volumes: Noteworthy transactions exceeding $100K totaled $93.77 billion during the week. This heightened activity among investors is a sign. Furthermore, with exchange inflows and outflows balancing at around $9.7 billion, it indicates that investors are not rushing to cash out their holdings.Market overview: The general outlook appears optimistic, supported by encouraging developments such as the possibility of ETF approval and growing attention from investors. Bitcoin typically follows these patterns, potentially propelling it to exceed the $70,000 mark again.Solana secured $180Solana remains one of the strongest assets on the market at this point in time. The "Ethereum killer" has retraced massively in the past, leaving investors in shambles, even with SOL at $140. However, after it reached $180, the profitability surged, but will it stay that way?Solana might be facing a correction phase. Technical indicators, such as the RSI, are nearing overbought levels, suggesting that the asset might be due for a pullback. Additionally, the price has hit a key resistance level that could trigger profit-taking among short-term traders.A correction phase is obviously a possibility; technical indicators like RSI are close to overbought levels and key resistances are broken, which could cause profit-taking, and sentiment indicators suggest an upcoming correction.Historical data indicates that Solana has experienced sharp corrections following substantial rallies. The current market environment, with its inherent volatility, adds to the uncertainty. While the fundamentals of Solana remain strong, and its ecosystem continues to grow, these factors do not entirely shield it from short-term market corrections.If Bitcoin and other major cryptocurrencies show signs of weakness, Solana could also see downward pressure. The interconnectedness of the crypto market often means that a decline in leading assets can lead to corrections in altcoins.

Whale Activity Surges in Optimism ($OP) and Chiliz ($CHZ) in ‘Signal Foreshadowing Price Reversals’ | Cryptoglobe


                                
Cryptocurrency whales have become significantly more active in two Ethereum-based altcoins, according to blockchain data that foreshadows “major volatility” and potential price reversals for these two altcoins.



According to on-chain analytics firm Santiment, whale activity has been surging for both Optimism ($OP) and Chiliz ($CHZ) in a move that “typically will foreshadow” major price volatility and reversals.



It’s worth noting that Optimism’s OP token is currently trading at $3.7 after moving up nearly 8% over the last week, and 4.5% over the last 30 days, whlle CHZ is up 1.8% in the last week and around 3% over the past month to now trade at $0.12.







Cryptocurrency whales have been rather active over the last few weeks, at a time in which the cryptocurrency market has been soaring, with Bitcoin recently surpassing the $70,000 mark amid growing expectations the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) will soon approve spot Ether exchange-traded funds.



As reported, a long-dormant Bitcoin whale has seemingly resurfaced after nearly 11 years and has recently moved 1,000 BTC worth nearly $61 million to new cryptocurrency wallets.



According on-chain analysis service Lookonchain, the whale made two transactions after being inactive for 10.7 years, moving funds from two wallets that received 500 BTC each back in September 2013, when Bitcoin was trading at just $124 per coin.







            
            

            
            

            
            

        

Institutional investors have entered the cryptocurrency space with force, with data suggesting that deep-pocketed investors gained interest in the space after the launch of spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) in the United States, leading to whales accumulating over $16 billion in BTC since.



Recent filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission have been revealing hedge funds and Wall Street giants added exposure to Bitcoin via spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds in the first quarter of the year, with Bracebridge Capital, a Boston-based hedge fund managing roughly $12 billion in assets, buying up $360 million over three funds.



The disclosure comes amid several others, with the U.S. state of Wisconsin recently becoming the first local government entity to reveal an investment in Bitcoin after purchasing 94,562 shares of BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT), worth nearly $100 million, in the first quarter of the year.



The move sees the state of Wisconsin join several Wall Street giants, including JPMorgan Chase and Wells Fargo, in revealing BTC exposure through investment in spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds, according to 13F filings.



JPMorgan revealed an investment of $731,246 in BlackRock’s IBIT ETF, Bitwise’s BITB, Fidelity’s FBTC, and Grayscale’s GBTC, while Wells Fargo disclosed $141,817 in GBTC holdings. BNP Paribas and BNY Mellon have also made similar disclosures.



BNP Paribas, the second-largest bank in Europe whose asset management arm has over $600 billion in assets under management, has gained exposure to the flagship cryptocurrency Bitcoin in the first quarter of the year as well by purchasing shares of IBIT.

Fourteen years ago, someone bought pizza with Bitcoin - Crypto Briefing


            
            
                            
            
                            
            
            It was, back then, a new transaction, conceived from peer-to-peer friendships, and dedicated to the proposition that commerce on the Internet has come to rely almost exclusively on financial institutions.Now we are almost a decade and a half on, in a movement that could test whether the ideas conceived by Satoshi Nakamoto can endure. We are met with regulatory hurdles, we have come to a point where the people are divided as a new regime looms ahead. Many of us have dedicated our lives so that this idea lives on.It is altogether fitting and proper that we should keep building and sharing, believing that crypto as a movement will always take us forward. Now let’s look back.Bitcoin Pizza DayOn May 22, 2010, a programmer named Laszlo Hanyecz made history by purchasing two pizzas for 10,000 BTC, marking the first time a cryptocurrency was used for a commercial transaction. This event, now known as Bitcoin Pizza Day, is celebrated annually by the global crypto community as a reminder of Bitcoin’s humble beginnings and the incredible progress made since then.Hanyecz, a programmer from Jacksonville, Florida, posted his offer on the Bitcointalk forum, one of the earliest online communities centered on Bitcoin.As one of the earliest crypto enthusiasts and innovators, Hanyecz contributed to early developments in Bitcoin mining, publishing software to improve mining efficiency for GPUs.At the time, no one could have predicted the significance of this transaction or the astronomical value that 10,000 BTC would hold in the future. Today, that amount of Bitcoin is worth approximately $692 million.Looking back, Hanyecz harbors no regrets over the historic purchase. “Someone had to start it,” he says.Bitcoin Pizza Days reminds us of the incredible journey that started with a simple pizza purchase. It’s a testament to the power of innovation and community and the potential for crypto to transform the way we think about and use money, programmable or otherwise.

Bitcoin Takeover Podcast


                    S15 E36: Eli Ben-Sasson on STARKs, Rollups & Privacy
                     2024-05-23
                    Eli Ben-Sasson is an academic computer scientist whose interest in zero-knowledge proofs has led him to become a co-founder of Zcash. More recently, he became the CEO of StarkWare: a company which aims to scale blockchains with ZK rollups & STARKs.

                                            Back in 2014, Eli Ben-Sasson co-authored the Zerocash paper, which proposed a ZK SNARK system that creates anonymous Bitcoin payments. Around the same time, he also spoke about the compression benefits of zero-knowledge proofs – a full Bitcoin node can be synced within seconds just by verifying against a valid proof.

More recently, he became interested in STARKs and built a company around this cryptographic breakthrough. If SNARKs require a trusted setup, then STARKs are a major leap towards trust minimization. 

If Bitcoin activates the OP_CAT soft fork, then this ZK rollup scheme also becomes possible to enable great privacy and low-sized transactions.

Top Trader Says Ethereum ETF Could Send Altcoins to the Stratosphere - Here’s His Top Pick - The Daily Hodl


								A top crypto trader thinks a spot Ethereum (ETH) exchange-traded fund (ETF) approval in the United States could send altcoins “to the stratosphere.”
The pseudonymous analyst known as the Flow Horse tells his 216,300 followers on the social media platform X that a spot ETH ETF would make the crypto markets “get crazier.”










“Here I am thinking spot and chill during the summer, but if we get an ETF approved for ETH the second wind is going to hit hard AF.”
The trader also says that top meme asset Dogecoin (DOGE) in particular has been “sitting in a really nice area for long.”
Source: TheFlowHorse/X
DOGE is trading at $0.169 at time of writing. The 9th-ranked crypto asset by market cap is up nearly 11% in the past 24 hours.
The Flow Horse also calls attention to the Ethereum open interest chart, which he says is “pretty wild.”
“No shame on anyone who sees this and thinks of dialing down the leverage. The most bullish **short term** case is that passive sellers did not adjust fast enough and are sitting underwater still.”

ETH is trading at $3,749 at time of writing. The second-ranked crypto asset by market cap is up nearly 20% in the past 24 hours.

$460 to $3.4 Million: Early $PEPE Investor Makes Realizes Gains of Over 740,000% | Cryptoglobe


                                
An early investor in the meme-inspired cryptocurrency $PEPE has recently realized a gain of around $3.4 million from an investment of little over $460 they made in the cryptocurrency’s early days to realize a gain of nearly 740,000%.



According to on-chain analysis service Lookonchain the trader spent just 0.22 ETH to buy their PEPE tokens in April of last year, which netted them a total of 324.9 billion PEPE. The trader has recently moved a final tranche of 182.9 billion tokens onto leading cryptocurrency exchange Binance, effectively divesting of their position for a total of $3.4 million.







The investor’s sale comes as the price of the meme-inspired cryptocurrency hits new highs, having recently briefly surpassed the $0.000014 mark before correcting slightly. Its gains came amid a wider cryptocurrency market rally that added over $200 billion to the space’s total market capitalization.



he catalyst for the broader market surge appears to be news related to the potential approval of spot Ether exchange-traded funds (ETFs) in the U.S as the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has abruptly requested that the exchanges that want to list and trade these funds update key filings related to these products, fueling speculation that the regulator is considering approving these products.







            
            

            
            

            
            

        

The surge saw Ethereum itself move up over 20% in a single day, while several Ethereum-related tokens, including memecoins, also jumped. Notably this isn’t the first time an investor makes a major gain with PEPE, as earlier this year CryptoGlobe reported on a whale who made over $3.3 million with the token.



Looking into the wallet of the the trader who turned little over $460 into millions trading the memecoin inspired on the infamous meme and cartoon character Pepe the Frog shortly after it was launched, data shows that the trader often invests in newly launched memecoins hoping one will take off.



The investor was early on several popular memecoins, but also seemingly on several memecoins that faded away soon after being launched, according to Etherscan data.

Dogecoin Holders Are Ditching DOGE for This New ICO – Could It Deliver 1,000% Gains? / Source: TradingView
                        As the Dogecoin (DOGE) price remains wedged to the south of $0.17 resistance, Dogecoin holders are ditching their DOGE tokens for a new ICO called 5thScape (5SCAPE), which some investors are betting will become a major leader in the crypto AR/VR space.Dogecoin was last changing hands around $0.1650, up 11% so far this week in tandem with a broader market rally.Under normal circumstances, now might not be the best time for Dogecoin holders to ditch their DOGE tokens.The cryptocurrency appears to have formed an ascending triangle pattern in the past few weeks.Such patterns typically form ahead of bullish breakouts. And if a bullish breakout does come, a quick return to March highs near $0.23 is probable.As Dogecoin forms an ascending triangle pattern and threatens a bullish breakout, this new ICO is getting a lot of attention. Source: TradingViewDogecoin could thus be setting up to post quick 40% gains, despite having already rallied 37% from early May lows.But Dogecoin’s bloated market cap, last nearly $24 billion as per CoinMarketCap, suggests room for further upside is limited.Long-term advocates of the meme coin hope it can one day hit $1. That would represent gains of north of 6x from current levels.But that would mean Dogecoin’s market cap reaching over $140 billion. That will be difficult to achieve, even if Bitcoin surges above $100,000.Traders looking to book bigger, faster gains often turn to smaller, more speculative altcoins.One potentially highly profitable strategy they often neglect is investing in presale investing.This is where upcoming web3 projects sell their native tokens at a discount to early investors to fund development.One project that the team at Cryptonews are big fans of is exciting AR/VR project 5thScape (5SCAPE).Many expect it to become a market leader, hence its no shock that Dogecoin holders are flocking to the token.Here’s why the new ICO could deliver 1,000% gains.New ICO 5thScape – Here’s Why It Could Deliver 1,000% Gains
5thScape is a first-of-its-kind crypto-infused VR/AR ecosystem that will be powered by the versatile 5SCAPE token.The project is an ecosystem of 5SCAPE-powered VR dApps. The beta version of its first game “MMA Cage Conquest” is already available in the META store.And the project’s exciting presale of its native 5SCAPE token has been making waves. The new ICO has already raised over $6.1 million.At the current price of $0.00327, investors are buying into the project at a market cap of under $20 million.They will also be sitting on paper gains of over 200% when the token launches at a planned $0.1.If 5thScape starts to gain traction as a market leader, it could easily become a $200+ million market cap coin.That could mean gains of over 10x or 1,000% for presale investors.But if investors want to get in at this favorable valuation, they need to move fast. When the presale hits $6.25 million, the price will jump 15% to $0.00376.$5SCAPE token can be bought today with ETH, MATIC, USDT, or BNB.80% of the total 5.1 billion token supply is available for purchase in the presale.Buy 5SCAPE Here

Political Ads Using AI Must Be Labeled, FCC Chair Says - Decrypt

If artificial intelligence is tapped to create a political advertisement, its use must be disclosed, according to a new proposal issued by the U.S. Federal Communications Commission. The FCC notice, published on Wednesday, comes nearly three months after an AI-generated robocall targeted voters in New Hampshire.Under the FCC proposal, political ads would require an on-air disclosure and a written disclosure kept on file by broadcasters whenever AI-generated content is included.“As artificial intelligence tools become more accessible, the commission wants to make sure consumers are fully informed when the technology is used,” FCC Chair Jessica Rosenworcel said in a statement, saying that consumers have a right to know when AI is used in the political content they see or hear.The disclosure rules would apply to both candidate and issue advertisements and entities that offer “origination programming,” or programming produced or acquired by a license for transmission to subscribers, including cable, satellite TV, and radio providers.Apart from the disclosure, the proposed policy does not outright ban AI-generated content. But the agency has taken similar actions in the past.In February, the FCC banned the use of AI-generated robocalls after an audio deepfake of U.S. President Joe Biden attempted to trick New Hampshire residents into not voting in the state’s primary election in February. Already the subject of previous AI-generated deepfakes, Biden called for the ban of AI voice impersonation during the State of the Union address in March.But while Biden called for the banning of AI voice impersonators, Congressional Candidate for Ohio’s 7th district Matt Diemer partnered with AI developer Civox AI to leverage the technology to engage with voters.“System like Civox allows me to put my voice out there to people,” Diemer previously told Decrypt. “That would be over 730,000 citizens throughout the state.”“It's no different than sending out blogs, emails, text messages, TikToks, or tweets,” he said. “This is another way for people to interact with me and have more of a connection.”Diemer, who was a periodic host on Decrypt's once-daily GM podcast, previously differentiated his candidacy through his support of crypto—making AI only the latest emerging technology added to his toolbox.Generative AI model developers, including Microsoft, OpenAI, Meta, Anthropic, and Google have already restricted or banned the use of their large language model platforms in being used for political ads.“In preparation for the many elections happening around the world in 2024 and out of an abundance of caution, we’re restricting the types of election-related queries for which Gemini will return responses," a Google spokesperson previously told Decrypt.Looking to the U.S. elections this fall and beyond, the FCC emphasized the need to stay vigilant against deceptive AI-generated deepfakes.“The use of AI is expected to play a substantial role in the creation of political ads in 2024 and beyond, but the use of AI-generated content in political ads also creates a potential for providing deceptive information to voters, in particular, the potential use of ‘deepfakes’—altered images, videos, or audio recordings that depict people doing or saying things that did not actually do or say, or events that did not actually occur,” the agency said.The FCC did not immediately respond to a request for comment from Decrypt.Edited by Ryan Ozawa.Generally Intelligent NewsletterA weekly AI journey narrated by Gen, a generative AI model.

                        The Japanese e-commerce giant Mercari has taken another step into the crypto sphere by launching Ethereum (ETH) trading services on its app.The Japanese media outlet CoinPost reported that the firm unveiled the service for Mercari users on May 21.

(Source: TBS News Dig Powered by JNN)In recent years, the firm has pivoted toward crypto. It has launched a crypto exchange that it has integrated with its marketplace app.This exchange has already proven a success. A survey conducted last year found that newer Japanese crypto users were more likely to use the crypto exchanges of Mercari or its e-commerce rival Rakuten than the platforms of more established crypto players.In January, Mercari also announced, via its Tokyo-based crypto subsidiary Melcoin, that it would begin accepting Bitcoin (BTC) on its platform.Melcoin processes BTC payments made on the platform, with “over 100,000” Bitcoin transactions already completed.Initially, buyers will be allowed to pay in Bitcoin, but vendors will receive yen. Prices will also be displayed in yen only.Mercari launched Bitcoin trading services on its app in March, with ETH the second coin to be added.A graph from Google Trends showing the rise in Japanese searches using the word “Ethereum” over the past 12 months.The ETH rollout will be made “in stages.” And Mercari users will be able to buy Ethereum with either credit or debit cards – or the firm’s own loyalty points.The firm says that around 2 million people have already started using its BTC trading services.Google Trends data shows a sharp rise in Ethereum-related searches since the start of the year in Japan.ETH interest has spiked again in recent days. This is likely due to reports that the United States Securities and Exchange Commission may soon approve spot ETH exchange-traded funds (ETFs).

U.S. House Passes “FIT21” Crypto Bill | Bankless


The U.S. House of Representatives just passed the Financial Innovation and Technology for the 21st Century Act (FIT21), marking a significant milestone in crypto regulation.What's the scoop?The House voted 279-136 to approve the bill, with 71 Democrats joining 208 Republicans in favor.FIT21 aims to regulate the digital assets market and would empower the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) as a key regulator alongside the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). The bill also includes consumer protections and provisions for stablecoins and anti-money laundering processes.High-profile Democrats, including former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, supported the bill, highlighting the rising bipartisan tide around crypto regulation. Several amendments were considered, with only those by Reps. Brittany Pettersen (D-Colo.) and Ralph Norman (R-S.C.) passing. Pettersen's amendment expands the Bank Secrecy Act to digital assets, while Norman's requires a study on foreign-owned digital asset businesses.Bankless take:The FIT21 legislation now moves to the U.S. Senate, where its future is uncertain due to a lack of a companion bill and unclear support. Even if FIT21 were to pass the upper house of Congress, it would still be subject to a potential veto by President Biden, who has been critical of the bill but hasn’t confirmed any veto plans yet. Whatever happens, it’s the first major non-resolution crypto bill approved by the U.S. House, marking a big political win for the crypto industry. The passing of the bill’s first hurdle coincides with a seemingly thawing regulatory environment in the U.S., as Ethereum ETFs seem on the verge of approval and the Senate recently repealed a SEC-backed crypto rule. If FIT21 does go on to succeed in the Senate, a new era of more sensible American crypto regulation would be decidedly within reach. via X

Bitcoin Price Prediction: BTC Near $70,000 Amid FOMC Meeting Minutes Revealing Inflation Concerns



Bitcoin (BTC/USD) is currently trading at $69,553, showing a modest increase of 0.63% over the last 24 hours. The pivot point, marked by the green line at $69,219, serves as a crucial level, indicating the primary trend direction.
Above this pivot point, the immediate resistance levels to watch are $72,030, $73,734, and $75,480. These levels represent potential barriers where selling pressure could increase, challenging further upward movement.
On the downside, support levels are identified at $67,549, $65,949, and $63,901. These levels could provide a cushion against declines, offering potential entry points for buyers.
Bitcoin Price Prediction – Source: Treadingview
The presence of an upward trendline further bolsters this bullish outlook. However, a break below the pivot point of $69,675 could trigger a sharp selling trend.
In conclusion, Bitcoin price prediction remains bullish at $69,675, but a breach below this level could lead to significant downside pressure.

                        Despite lots of positive newsflow on the US regulatory front on Wednesday, major cryptos spent most of the session unwinding recent gains, with investors hunting for the best crypto to buy now needing to get selective in their search for near-term gains.Bitcoin (BTC) was last down around 1.5% in the past 24 hours and trading just above $69,000.Ethereum (ETH), meanwhile, was last changing hands in the mid-$3,700s while Solana (SOL) was just under $180.Crypto markets, and in particular ETH and its major ecosystem tokens, remain substantially higher on the week.The catalyst was a u-turn from the SECv, who now seem on the verge of approving spot Ethereum ETFs.19-4b applications could be approved as soon as tomorrow, paving the way for ETF launches in the coming weeks/months.But a major piece of comprehensive crypto legislation just secured a bipartisan majority in the US House.There is no guarantee is makes it through the Senate and gets signed off by President Biden.But that is major progress for the crypto industry in the USA.It’s a major step towards reigning in the SEC, who have been on an anti-crypto regulation by enforcement rampage.And it sends a message to the Biden administration that their up-until-now default anti-crypto stance is a losing battle.The excitement regarding progress in US crypto legislation and Ethereum ETFs meant the Fed minutes release was pretty much ignored.For what it’s worth, the minutes emphasized that policymakers are concerned about the lack of progress on inflation in 2024.But that much has been obvious for weeks in wake of all the recent Fed speak.Market’s Near-term Trajectory Likely to Remain Bullish
Assuming upcoming US data releases don’t retrigger fears of sticky inflation and trigger a fresh pricing out of Fed rate cut bets, the market’s near-term trajectory is likely to remain to the upside.The market’s focus is likely to remain on bullish themes like Ethereum ETFs and US regulation/policy/political headwinds.Bitcoin could soon retest yearly highs near $74,000. And Ether will likely soon trade back to the north of $4,000.Either could be the best crypto to buy right now. Bitcoin remains the undisputed king of crypto.

Decentralized options market pricing on DeFi derivatives market Lyra suggests a 20% chance of ETH hitting $5,000 by the end of June.Either could be the best crypto to buy now.

Altcoins are a great way to make quick gains in crypto.However, most of the above-mentioned coins are already too well-established to provide traders with gains of upwards of 10x.For those bigger gains, traders will need to get in super early on newer coins with lower market caps.Of course, this isn’t for the faint-hearted.That said, for risk-tolerant investors looking to add upside exposure to their portfolios, presale investing is potentially a good strategy.Web3 startups often sell their token at an early discount in presales to fund development and build hype.However, with so many presales vying for investor funds, it can be tough to know where to start.That’s why analysts at Cryptonews compiled this list of their top picks.22 Best Crypto Presales to Invest In Now

Bitcoin Demand Has 'Considerably' Slowed Down, Report Finds


								The on-chain analytics firm Glassnode revealed in its latest weekly report that demand for Bitcoin has slowed recently.
Bitcoin Realized Cap Has Slowed Down Its Uptrend Recently
In its new report, Glassnode has discussed the latest development in the Bitcoin Realized Cap. The “Realized Cap” refers to an on-chain capitalization model for BTC that calculates the asset’s value by assuming the value of each coin in circulation to be equal to the spot price at which it was last moved on the blockchain.
As the last transfer on the network for any coin was probably the last time it changed hands, the price at that time could be assumed to be its current cost basis. As such, the Realized Cap is a total sum for the cost basis of the entire circulating supply.

In other words, this model represents the total capital that the investors used to purchase Bitcoin. Because of this, this metric is used to track whether capital is flowing into or out of the cryptocurrency.
Here is the chart shared by Glassnode that shows the trend in the Bitcoin Realized Cap over the last few years:

The value of the metric appears to have been heading up in recent months | Source: Glassnode's The Week Onchain - Week 21, 2024
As displayed in the above graph, the Bitcoin Realized Cap had been riding a sharp uptrend earlier when the rally toward the new all-time high (ATH) took place. This rapid growth naturally implied that capital was aggressively flowing into the asset.
Recently, though, the metric’s trajectory has become less steep. Its value is still growing, and new ATHs are being set, but it’s clear that the increase is much smaller in scale than earlier.
“Currently, the rate at which new capital is flowing into the Bitcoin network has slowed down considerably from its peak as the market digests the recently distributed supply,” reads the report.
The chart below better represents how the rate of change of capital flowing into the sector has changed recently.

Looks like the value of the indicator has rapidly gone down recently | Source: Glassnode's The Week Onchain - Week 21, 2024
When investors sell at a net profit, the Realized Cap increases as there is some demand to buy the coins at a higher price. On the other hand, the metric heads down when loss realization occurs, as coins previously purchased with a higher amount of capital have been sold for a lower amount of capital, thus bringing the total investment in the cryptocurrency down.

As the Bitcoin Net Realized Profit/Loss graph shows, the market absorbed a large amount of profits when the ATH formed. Since then, though, the metric has cooled off considerably, further showcasing the lower demand in the sector.

Bitcoin surpassed the $71,000 level yesterday, but the asset appears to have dropped today as it’s now back at $70,200.

Ethereum Whales Come Alive: Are They Buying Or Selling?


																On-chain data suggests the Ethereum whales have shown a burst of activity recently. Here’s what these titans have been up to.
Ethereum Whale Transactions Are At Their Highest Since March
In a new post on X, the market intelligence platform IntoTheBlock has discussed how the ETH whales have become active recently.
The on-chain metric of interest here is the “Number of Large Transactions,” which, according to the analytics firm, tracks the total number of Ethereum transactions on the network valued at more than $100,000.

	Related Reading


Generally, only whale entities can make such large single transaction movements, so such large transfers are associated with these humongous investors.
As such, the Number of Large Transactions indicator can tell us whether this cohort is active right now. The chart below shows the recent trend in this Ethereum metric.
The value of the metric appears to have spiked in recent days | Source: IntoTheBlock on X
The graph shows that the Number of large transactions for Ethereum has sharply increased recently. This suggests that the whales have ramped up their activity.
The whales have come alive as news surfaced that the ETH spot exchange-traded funds (ETFs) could have improved their approval odds. The hype in the market has meant that ETH has enjoyed a rapid increase, taking its price back around the $3,800 level.
With all this happening in the market, it’s only natural that these humongous entities would be repositioning themselves. As the scale of this cohort’s transactions is quite big, a large number of them taking place together can be powerful enough to cause ripples in the market. Thus, ETH could likely witness volatility shortly if the current high whale activity persists.
However, the direction this volatility might take on Ethereum depends on whether these investors collectively buy or sell. IntoTheBlock data has also provided hints about this, as the below chart for the “Large Holders Netflow” shows.
It looks like the value of the metric has been positive recently | Source: IntoTheBlock on X
This indicator measures the net amount of Ethereum moving into or out of the wallets of “Large Holders.” The analytics firm defines Large Holders as those who own at least 0.1% of the entire circulating asset supply.

The graph shows that the Large Holders have been participating in accumulation recently, as the netflow has been positive for them. Thus, it appears that the recent activity from the whales has involved net-buying.
It remains to be seen if these humongous entities will continue to display this trend in the coming days, potentially helping fuel the rally.
ETH Price
At the time of writing, Ethereum is floating around $3,750, up more than 26% over the past week.

Retail Frenzy: Small Ethereum Investors Hit All-Time High as Whales Retreat | Cryptoglobe


                                
The number of small Ethereum ($ETH) investors, those holding 10 ETH or less (around $37,500), has recently climbed to a new all-time high while larger investors are seemingly still lagging behind after divesting most of their funds over the last few months.



According to data from on-chain analytics firm Santiment, smaller Ethereum wallets hits a new all-time high of 121.74 million after the recent ETH price surge, while those holding between 10 and 10,000 ETH  – between $37,500 and $37.5 million – are still down a around 5.8% this year.



Notably larger whales, those that have over $37.5 million worth of the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization in their wallets, are down 10.6% in terms of total holdings after divesting of their ETH over the last few months.







Notably the price of ETH has recently surged over news related to the potential approval of spot Ether exchange-traded funds (ETFs) in the U.S as the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has abruptly requested that the exchanges that want to list and trade these funds update key filings related to these products, fueling speculation that the regulator is considering approving these products.



Before any trading can begin, issuers of spot Ether ETFs must receive the go-ahead on their S-1 registration statements, with the SEC having no set deadline to review these filings.







            
            

            
            

            
            

        

The SEC’s ongoing investigation into Ether, the native cryptocurrency of the Ethereum blockchain, has intensified over the last few months, especially after the network’s transition to a Proof-of-Stake protocol.



Should Ether be classified as a security, it could provide the SEC with a basis to deny the applications for spot Ether ETFs. Nevertheless, the surge led to the spike in small ETH holders while seeing the cryptocurrency’s trading volume explode.







The SEC is seemingly nearing a decision on spot Ether ETFs, as the Cboe exchange has published amended 19b-4 filings in response to regulatory feedback for several applicants including asset management giants BlackRock, Fidelity, VanEck, and Franklin Templeton, among others.



These filings came after the SEC requested standardized revisions where applicants could all use the same wording. While final approval of the applications remains uncertain, the feedback has boosted optimism within the industry, with some anticipating approvals as early as this week.

U.S. House of Representatives Passes Landmark Crypto Bill - Brave New Coin

The U.S. House of Representatives voted 279-136 to approve the Financial Innovation and Technology for the 21st Century Act, with significant support from House Democrats.On Wednesday, the crypto industry achieved its largest-ever U.S. policy victory as the House passed a comprehensive bill to regulate digital asset markets. The vote, which saw Democrats crossing party lines, ended with 279 in favor and 136 against. The crypto market-structure bill represents the industry’s most notable legislative success in Congress to date. Financial InnovationThe Financial Innovation and Technology for the 21st Century Act (FIT21) is the first major crypto bill to clear one chamber of Congress. The bill now heads to the U.S. Senate, where its future is uncertain due to the absence of a counterpart bill and unclear support. The Senate committees have not yet undertaken significant work on crypto regulation. Despite the House’s strong victory, establishing comprehensive oversight for the crypto industry in the U.S. is still a work in progress.“We need rules of the road,” said Rep. Josh Gottheimer (D-N.J.), a Democrat who supported the bill despite opposition from the White House and the ranking Democrat on the House Financial Services Committee, Rep. Maxine Waters (D-Calif.). He described the bill as “well-reasoned, thoughtful, bipartisan legislation” and urged collaboration to make it law.In total, 71 Democrats and 208 Republicans voted for the bill, while 3 Republicans and 133 Democrats opposed it.Jake Chervinsky, a lawyer who supports crypto, posted on X, “That is a *huge* number of elected Democrats voting “no confidence” in the current SEC, and sending a message to the Biden administration that “anti-crypto” is a losing platform this year.”The fact that so many democrats supported the bill suggests that the democrats are unwilling to alienate crypto-loving Americans in the lead up to the election cycle. Biden and Gensler OpposedPresident Joe Biden opposed the bill but did not threaten a veto, unlike a recent effort by Congress to overturn an SEC policy on crypto accounting. SEC Chair Gary Gensler also criticized the legislation, arguing it was unnecessary and jeopardized existing securities regulations.Gensler wrote, “The Financial Innovation and Technology for the 21st Century Act (“FIT 21”) would create new regulatory gaps and undermine decades of precedent regarding the oversight of investment contracts, putting investors and capital markets at immeasurable risk.First, the bill would remove investment contracts that are recorded on a blockchain from the statutory definition of securities and the time-tested protections of much of the federal securities laws.Further, by removing this set of investment contracts from the statutory list of securities, the bill implies what courts have repeatedly ruled – but what crypto market participants have attempted to deny – that many crypto assets are being offered and sold as securities under existing law.”The legislation, mainly driven by House Republicans, aims to regulate the U.S. crypto markets by setting consumer protections, appointing the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) as the primary regulator of digital assets, and clarifying the definitions of crypto tokens as securities or commodities.Rep. Maxine Waters argued that the bill would allow crypto businesses that have evaded securities laws to escape accountability. “They have already made billions of dollars unlawfully issuing or facilitating the buying and selling of crypto securities,” she said. “And Republicans are now proposing to reward these illegal activities by making them legal.”Before the vote, the House debated several amendments to the bill, including those by Reps. Greg Casar (D-Texas), Brittany Pettersen (D-Colo.), Ralph Norman (R-S.C.), and Scott Perry (R-Pa.). While Casar’s amendment to change a crowdfunding exemption from $75 million to $5 million was defeated, the rest were adopted. The BillFIT21 will protect consumers by strengthening transparency and accountability with market participants:Digital asset developers will be required to provide accurate, relevant disclosures, including information relating to the digital asset project’s operation, ownership, and structure; andDigital asset customer-serving institutions, like exchanges, brokers, and dealers will be required to:Provide appropriate disclosures to customers;Segregate customer funds from their own; andReduce conflicts of interest through registration, disclosure, and operational requirements.FIT21 will strengthen the market by protecting digital asset projects:Digital asset developers will have a pathway to raise funds; andParticipants will have a clear process to determine which digital asset transactions are subject to the SEC’s jurisdiction and the CFTC’s jurisdiction.FIT21 will protect digital asset customer-serving institutions by:Establishing clear lines between the SEC and CFTC; andCreating comprehensive registration regimes to permit them to lawfully serve customers in digital asset markets. Trump Embraces CryptoMeanwhile, President Trump’s campaign began accepting crypto donations this week. Its website says, “Demonstrating President Trump’s success as a champion of American freedom and innovation, we proudly offer you a chance to contribute to the campaign with cryptocurrency. Saving our nation from Biden’s failures requires your support. As Biden piles regulations and red tape on all of us, President Trump stands ready to embrace new technologies that will Make America Great Again.” The website allows donors to donate amounts of $20.24, $45, $47, $2024, or $4547.Source: Trump

Binance's Ban Reversed By Florida Court, BNB Sees 7% Uptrend Nearing All-Time Highs | Bitcoinist.com


								In a significant development for the cryptocurrency industry, the First District Court of Appeals in Florida has unanimously ruled against a permanent ban on Binance, the world’s largest cryptocurrency exchange. 
According to a Bloomberg Law report, the court determined that the state’s financial regulators had not followed proper procedures when issuing an emergency suspension order, thereby denying Binance the ability to operate in the state.
Binance Wins Legal Battle
The ban, imposed by the Florida Office of Financial Regulation in November 2023, came shortly after former Binance Holdings CEO Changpeng Zhao pleaded guilty to federal finance charges. 
However, the court highlighted that the regulators failed to substantiate their legal conclusions, particularly regarding the alleged danger posed by Zhao’s conduct.
The court’s ruling emphasized that the emergency suspension order lacked a clear basis in law, as the regulators did not adequately demonstrate that Zhao’s actions threatened public health, safety, and welfare. 

While the court’s decision is a significant win for Binance, the exchange has also faced regulatory challenges in other jurisdictions. The banking division of Alaska, for instance, also rejected the renewal of Binance.US’s license to operate in the state during the same period. 
Binance’s founder, Changpeng Zhao, commonly known as CZ, has been sentenced to four months in prison. The sentencing follows his guilty plea to charges related to facilitating money laundering activities on the cryptocurrency exchange.
Notably, Zhao’s sentence was less severe than the three-year prison term sought by federal prosecutors. In contrast, the defense had requested five months of probation, ultimately achieving the desired outcome. 
As part of the resolution, Binance was ordered to pay a substantial $4.3 billion fines and forfeiture. Additionally, Changpeng Zhao personally agreed to pay a significant $50 million fine.
BNB Nears All-Time High Amid Market Uptrend
As this development unfolded, Binance’s native token, BNB, has exhibited renewed bullish momentum in line with the overall market uptrend observed over the past week, led by major cryptocurrencies.
During the last month, BNB has demonstrated significant gains, accumulating a 4% increase over the past 30 days and a substantial 7% surge in the previous week alone. Consequently, its current trading price stands at $620. 
Notably, this places the fourth-largest cryptocurrency near its all-time high (ATH) of $686, achieved during the 2021 bull market.
However, according to CoinGecko data, BNB has experienced a 66% decline in trading volume in recent days, totaling $1 billion over the past 24 hours. Nonetheless, if the present uptrend persists, there are only a few resistance levels to monitor before a potential retest of its ATH.

Analyzing the BNB/USD 4-hour chart, the next significant resistance levels, $621.5 and $633, represent the primary obstacles that must be overcome for the token to continue its ascent to higher levels.
In contrast, BNB bulls must remain vigilant regarding the support lines at $614 and $605 to prevent a downtrend that could lead to a test of the crucial $600 support level.

Ethereum Price Consolidates: Steadying Before the Next Move?


																Ethereum price started a consolidation phase above the $3,650 support. ETH seems to be preparing for the next move up toward $4,000 in the near term.

The price is trading above $3,700 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average.
There is a short-term contracting triangle forming with support at $3,690 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD (data feed via Kraken).
The pair could continue to move up unless there is a break below the $3,450 support.

Ethereum Price Holds Support
Ethereum price extended its increase above the $3,500 and $3,650 resistance levels. ETH outperformed Bitcoin and even climbed above the $3,800 level. A new weekly high was formed at $3,838 and the price is now consolidating gains.
It is holding gains above the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the upward move from the $3,065 swing low to the $3,838 high.

                        South Korean police officers have arrested 28 people they suspected of orchestrating a crypto investment fraud ring.Per Jose Geumyoong Shinmun and the broadcaster KBC, a raid was conducted by the Gwangju Metropolitan Police Agency’s Cyber Crime Investigation Unit.South Korean Police Arrest ‘Bogus Exchange Ringleaders’
Police spokespeople confirmed they had detained six of the group in custody, with a further 22 charged without detention.Officers think the group duped “about 50 victims” out of a combined total of around $1.3 million.Investigators said the ring was active from July to December last year. Police spokespeople added that the gang’s members told victims that they could make money by investing in little-known cryptoassets.The ring reportedly told victims that these coins were about to be listed on major crypto exchanges.After these listings, the gang allegedly told victims, investors could expect the prices of these coins to skyrocket.The Gwangju Metropolitan Police Agency’s Cyber Crime Investigation Unit. (Source: KBC/SBS/Screenshot)However, police said that these coins were all “worthless,” and that none of the tokens had been listed on any exchange of note.Fake Crypto Experts Tricked Victims, Police Say
Officers also explained that the ring members posed as cryptoasset “experts” and tried to “lure” victims onto what appears to be a bogus trading platform.Police said the platform was not registered with the Financial Intelligence Unit, the regualtor that governs the South Korean crypto exchange sector.The ring then proceeded to “steal investment stakes,” police said. Officers explained that the ring told victims that their funds were safe, and they could expect “high profits” soon.Investigators said the operation was complex, and that the ring had divided into a “sales team unit” and a “public relations team.”The Gwangju Metropolitan Police Agency headquarters. (Source: KBC/SBS/Screenshot)The suspects were charged with several offenses, including organized crime. Police said they were “investigating additional crimes” related to the ring.South Korean police crackdowns have unearthed scores of bogus crypto exchanges in recent months.Courts, meanwhile, have handed convicted offenders heavy sentences. Earlier this month, a judge sent a fake XRP exchange operator to prison for eight years.And in January, the Supreme Court sent the CEO of V Global, a fake crypto exchange that defrauded thousands of victims, to jail for 25 years.

This One Crypto Is Most Associated With NVDA, Here How It's Doing After The Tech Giant's Blockbuster Quarter - Benzinga

Top AI-based cryptocurrency tokens tumbled after AI chip giant Nvidia Corp. NVDA reported higher-than-expected earnings for the first quarter Wednesday.What Happened: Render RNDR/USD, the token with the "most significant" ties with the tech giant, was trading 3.79% lower at the time of writing, according to data from Benzinga Pro. The token made gains ahead of the earnings announcement, rising to a two-month high of $11.81. However, profit-hungry traders locked in gains immediately afterRNDR's trading volume nearly doubled in the last 24 hours, surpassing meme powerhouse Shiba Inu SHIB/USDAccording to on-chain analytics firm Santiment, whale engagement with the AI token was rising. An investor with significant RNDR holdings sent nearly 4.9 million tokens to an unknown wallet earlier, potentially selling them off.Santiment alerted that holders of the token should brace for higher volatility ahead. Why It Matters: An X user going by the pseudonym CryptoDNA underlined the factors behind RNDR's dip after Nvidia's blockbuster first-quarter earnings. "Leverage is the reason we dipped. Imagine how many investors entered into 100x longs after the very bullish earnings call. You think the Market Makers would make it that easy?" the analyst commented. That said, the analyst assured that "there's nothing to worry about" as it's part of the ebbs and flows of the market."We’re going so much higher, and RENDER will lead the entire AI sector.  I’ve never been so bullish in my life, and my entire portfolio is built around RNDR."The analyst's assertion had merit as the number of traders longing RNDR started increasing in the last few hours, according to data from Coinglass. This suggested a belief in the token's upside potential.Read Next: ‘Shiba Inu Killer’ Dogwifhat Hat Makes A 11% Comeback: ‘Hatted Dog Is Headed To $10,’ Trader Touts

Landmark Crypto Bill Gets US House Approval


On Wednesday, the crypto industry achieved a historic milestone as the US House of Representatives passed the Financial Innovation and Technology for the 21st Century Act (FIT21).
The bill, which aims to establish a comprehensive regulatory framework for digital assets, was approved with bipartisan support in a 279-136 vote. This marks a significant step towards legal clarity in the crypto space.
FIT21 Gets Strong Support from Lawmakers and Industry Leaders
With 71 Democrats joining 208 Republicans in favor, the passage signals a growing consensus on the need for clear crypto regulations. Introduced in July 2023, the bill aims to define the roles of the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) in overseeing cryptocurrencies. It also establishes guidelines for various aspects of the crypto market, including token issuance, trading, and custody.

Several legislators have expressed their strong support for the bill’s passage. Congressman John Rose highlighted the need to move away from regulation by enforcement.

“I’ve had enough of Biden Administration officials regulating by enforcement. That’s why I support FIT21, legislation that will prevent the government from standing in the way of digital innovation. The bill includes critical guardrails that will protect consumers and foster innovation,” Congressman Rose said.

Additionally, Representative Wiley Nickel stressed the importance of establishing a modern regulatory framework that acknowledges the unique nature of digital assets.

“FIT21 provides a clear regulatory framework for digital assets instead of relying on 90-year-old securities law written before the Internet existed. That’s a big deal. Whether you love or hate crypto, you should support regulation,” Representative Nickel stated.

Industry leaders echoed this enthusiasm. Brad Garlinghouse, CEO of Ripple, praised the bipartisan support for FIT21 and criticized the SEC’s approach to crypto regulation.

“Today, more than ever, we are seeing what a political liability Gensler has been to the Biden administration. It’s the reason we saw 71 Democrats cross the aisle and support FIT21. We are just getting started!” Garlinghouse wrote on his X (Twitter) account.

Jake Chervinsky, Chief Legal Officer at Variant, also shared his perspectives regarding the bill’s passage. He sees it as a vote of no confidence in the SEC’s current stance on crypto.

“House Democrats voting in favor of this bill: 71. That is a huge number of elected Democrats voting ‘no confidence’ in the current SEC, and sending a message to the Biden administration that ‘anti-crypto’ is a losing platform this year,” he said.

Despite the significant progress in the House, FIT21 faces an uncertain future in the Senate. A counterpart bill is currently absent.
Moreover, the necessary committees have yet to engage in the same level of work on crypto. This makes the path forward less certain.

Yet, the White House has expressed its opposition to the bill, citing concerns about consumer and investor protections. The administration acknowledges the need for a regulatory framework for digital assets. However, they believe FIT21 requires additional safeguards in its current form.

“The Administration looks forward to continued collaboration with Congress on developing legislation for digital assets that includes adequate guardrails for consumers and investors while creating the conditions needed for innovation, and further time will be needed for such collaboration,” the White House wrote.

However, President Joe Biden’s statement did not mention a veto threat. This contrasts with his stance on another crypto-related bill, Staff Accounting Bulletin 121 (SAB 121).

BeInCrypto previously reported that SEC Chair Gary Gensler also voiced strong opposition to the bill before the House vote. He argued that it weakens SEC oversight and warned that it could increase investor risks and harm US markets.

Despite the opposition, the passage marks a pivotal moment in the ongoing effort to provide clear regulations for the crypto industry in the US. With the FIT21 Act now in the Senate’s hands, the industry is watching closely to see if it will become law. Nevertheless, this development will potentially transform the regulatory environment for digital assets in the United States.

Bitcoin whales: Unusual activity raises these questions - AMBCrypto



Bitcoin whale activity saw an uptick, which usually does not occur during this part of the cycle.
The realized price gradient oscillator showed bulls need to maintain their momentum. 

Bitcoin [BTC] was gaining bullish momentum as prices approached the all-time high. It saw a 4% pullback in the past two days that retested the $69k support zone. The technical indicators remained bullish.
Accumulation continued apace, while prices stagnated in April and the first half of May.
In a recent AMBCrypto report, the data highlighted that Bitcoin might be readying to embark on a 300-day bull run. The evidence at hand further reinforced the bullish bias.
This momentum indicator shows bulls have to maintain the pressure or risk a slump

Crypto analyst Axel Adler posted on X (formerly Twitter) a piece of on-chain analysis that highlighted the current momentum of Bitcoin and the values the gradient reached in the past 18 months.
The price gradient oscillator above measures how quickly the market cap grows compared to the realized cap.
During the 2021 rally, as BTC neared its eventual top, the oscillator formed lower highs which indicated a fading bull trend.
In 2024, the oscillator has formed a lower high at 2.96. Hence, a move past 3 would be desirable for bulls to avoid repeating the 2021 pattern, which would signal fading bullishness.
At the time of writing, the oscillator reading was at 1.38.
“It’s only a matter of time” for Bitcoin to hit all-time highs

Analyst Willy Woo noted that the available Bitcoin was being scooped up during the past two months when the price lacked a true higher timeframe trend.
This led to panic among retail holders, but the spot BTC demand was sizeable.
The analyst believed that it’s only a matter of time before the prices climb past their all-time high against the US Dollar.

The exchange whale ratio saw a rising trend in April and May. This indicated increased whale activity, which is abnormal during a bull run. Usually, during the bullish long-term trend, whale activity quietens down.
It picked up once the top was in and prices started sliding lower.

Read Bitcoin’s [BTC] Price Prediction 2024-25

The outflow from exchanges that Willy Woo highlighted earlier was a good argument against the top being in, but the rising whale activity can give investors pause.
However, the exchange whale ratio is not definitive, and the evidence at hand shows this bull run has further to go.

Dogecoin Reversal Imminent, Says This Analyst - Predicts Over 30% Upside - Benzinga

Dogecoin DOGE/USD has underperformed vis-à-vis the rest of the memecoin market in the last two weeks, but an analyst predicted massive gains for the original dog-themed token in the days ahead.What Happened: Popular cryptocurrency trader Kevin drew attention to the coin's inverse head and shoulders pattern on the price chart. He observed a consolidation around the neckline.Typically, technical analysts take the aforementioned formation as a sign of a potential reversal from a downward trajectory. The neckline serves as a resistance level that the price must break through to confirm the pattern.Kevin anticipated DOGE to break to the upside in the next 2-3 days, potentially soaring to $0.22. This would mean a 32% jump from prevailing prices. Another widely-followed cryptocurrency trader, who goes by the pseudonym Lieutenant Ponzi, predicted a DOGE rip in the "not too far" future.Why It Matters: The total holdings of long-term investors of DOGE rose marginally by 0.03% in the last 24 hours, according to IntoTheBlock, signaling accumulation in anticipation of a price rise. This observation was backed by the negative exchange net flows recorded in the last 24 hours, suggesting that more funds were leaving than entering exchanges. The number of bullish long positions taken for the coin also increased in comparison to bearish shorts in the last 24 hours, according to Coinglass.Price Action: At the time of writing, DOGE was exchanging hands at $0.1658, following a 2.45% decline in the last 24 hours, according to data from Benzinga Pro. Photo Courtesy: Shutterstock.comRead Next: This One Crypto Is Most Associated With NVDA, Here How It’s Doing After The Tech Giant’s Blockbuster Quarter

Community Erupts as Key Players From Ethereum Foundation Become Advisors to Eigenlayer - The Defiant

Ethereum Foundation researchers Dankrad Feist and Justin Drake are catching flak for their multimillion-dollar deals with the restaking protocol. Some defend them, however. A pair of Ethereum’s top researchers are at the center of a widespread controversy surrounding their recent involvement as advisors to restaking protocol EigenLayer – in no small part due to their lucrative compensation.Justin Drake was the first to disclose his new role – although Dankard Feist pointed out that his deal with Eigenlayer has the same conditions – outlining the details in a lengthy May 19 X post.He began his 11-point post by saying the “community deserves transparency” and then dove straight into the meatier aspects of his deal.According to Drake, the advisorship comes with a significant financial incentive in the form of EIGEN tokens that have the potential to exceed any of his other holdings, including ETH, and lands well into the millions of dollars.That first point alone immediately set the house on fire.EigenLayer is the industry’s largest restaking protocol, commanding more than 95% of the sector’s total value locked (TVL). According to DefiLlama, the protocol has experienced a 25% increase in TVL, now holding more than $18 billion. It is followed from afar by Karak, which showcases a similar weekly trend but only holds $739 million in TVL.EigenLayer TVLCredible NeutralityMany members of the Ethereum community are complaining about a concept dubbed credible neutrality, which has been a longstanding point of contention.Essentially, people are asking that if Drake and Feist take these million-dollar advisorships, how are they going to remain neutral regarding the direction of the Ethereum network? Might they subtly favor EigenLayer above competing protocols?Now, it’s important to note that both Drake and Feist have signaled that they will be advising in a personal capacity, independent of the work they do at the Ethereum Foundation. But will that be enough? For some, the conflict of interest – thereby tearing down credible neutrality – is simply too big to ignore.“I am appalled that we have EF researchers, the people who guide the protocol development, take 6-7 figure compensation packages from protocols,” wrote Lefteris Karapetsas, founder of Rotkiapp, a privacy-focused portfolio tracker.He added, “this is a clear-as-day conflict of interest of key decision makers of Ethereum protocol development and should absolutely not be tolerated.”Karapetsas isn’t alone in his view. “What is a core EF contributor doing when he accepts roles on projects that have conflicted incentives with Ethereum? Where’s the credible neutrality?” quipped the pseudonymous eMon.Questions also surfaced from the pseudonymous safetyth1rd, who asked, “You’re seriously stating that taking huge compensation from an organization with different incentives than Ethereum will not influence your decision-making? You realize we’re not five-year-olds, right?”However, the community remains divided over the issue.Not Everyone Is Against The AdvisorshipFor Hudson Jameson, VP of Polygon Labs, disclosing advisor roles when working on Ethereum should be a requirement. That said, he isn’t against the deals struck by Drake and Feist.Jameson voiced concerns about Karapetsas’ view.“I am concerned that this type of pure idealism could result in good, honest core developers and researchers leaving Ethereum protocol development because they aren't allowed to partake in the same advising situations that others, including many devs on L2 and MEV projects, commonly do,” he said.And along with Jameson, there were dozens of other Ethereum community members that congratulated both Drake and Feist for their transparency.“Best disclosure I’ve ever seen. Should be a model for the industry going forward,” posted Hart Lambur, co-founder of Across Protocol, an interoperability protocol on the UMA protocol, along with another user who shouted out “full respect for Justin’s transparency.”Drake Preemptively Addresses ConcernsWithin Drake’s disclosure post were a couple of comments regarding potential backlash from the community.Specifically, point 8 read, “Some people may ask if EigenLayer is trying to systematically "bribe" or "corrupt" the EF, wrote Drake, adding that “EFers are some of the highest integrity people I know, and I don't see the 1% of EFers formally involved with EigenLayer compromising their morals.”And Drake underscored the potential risks that come with his advisory role.“I do acknowledge that accepting the EigenFoundation advisorship inevitably comes with downside risk beyond my personal reputation. I hope the above shows that it is at least a considered move with calculated risks.”Feist Will “Be Expected” To Be Contrarian Regarding EigenlayerIn another move to assuage the ire in some areas of the Ethereum community, Feist explained that he and Drake live on separate sides of the aisle when it comes to restaking.And his aisle is one that acknowledges the significant risks involved in this type of protocol.Even though he pointed out that he wouldn’t have taken the role if he didn’t see clear benefits to restaking when implemented well, Feist listed four threats that come with Eigenlayer. These include the “principal-agent problem,” where two key players in the ecosystem might have countering incentives, and the potential for centralization due to additional load imposed by stakers running restaking services.Feist pointed out that a third risk is bribing attacks, wherein restaking infrastructure is used to mount attacks on the Ethereum protocol. Feist ended on the fear of what he calls many in the Ethereum community that Eigenlayer will “turn into a dystopia dangerously designed restaking services that stakers will have to opt into because they will provide most of the staking yield.”However, Feist indicated that his advisory role aims to mitigate the second and third risks.Justin Drake, Dankard Feist, EigenLayer, and the Ethereum Foundation did not immediately respond to a request for comment from The Defiant.

                        Investment firm Metaplanet has experienced a remarkable surge in its shares, skyrocketing 158% over the past week and emerging as the highest gainer among all Japanese stocks.The company’s share price currently stands at 93 Japanese yen, experiencing a staggering 127% increase in just two days.The rapid growth even triggered the Tokyo Stock Exchange to activate a circuit breaker trading halt on multiple occasions within the past week. With a market cap of nearly $1 billion (14.8 billion Japanese yen), Metaplanet is making significant waves in the financial market.Metaplanet Follows the Footsteps of MicroStrategy
This success can be attributed to the company’s adoption of a strategy similar to that of MicroStrategy, the largest corporate holder of Bitcoin.Since announcing its Bitcoin investment strategy on April 8, Metaplanet has accumulated 117.7 Bitcoin, currently valued at $7.2 million. Consequently, its stock has surged by 389%.In a statement issued on May 13, Metaplanet revealed its intention to employ a range of capital market instruments strategically to bolster its Bitcoin reserves, mirroring MicroStrategy’s approach.The firm cited the need to hedge against Japan’s mounting debt burden and the rapid depreciation of the Japanese yen.Japan holds the unfortunate distinction of having the worst debt-to-GDP ratio among developed countries, currently standing at 261%.Additionally, the Japanese yen has depreciated by over 34% against the United States dollar since the beginning of 2021.Metaplanet views its Bitcoin investment strategy as a direct response to these economic pressures.While Metaplanet is currently only available for trading on the Tokyo Stock Exchange, limiting access to U.S. investors, there are plans underway to tokenize its shares on the Bitcoin layer-2 network Liquid.Arnab Naskar, one of the founders of security token platform STOKR, has expressed intentions to tokenize Metaplanet shares, following a similar approach used to tokenize MicroStrategy stock.Last month, Metaplanet revealed its decision to incorporate Bitcoin into its treasury assets due to several factors. Firstly, it aims to minimize its exposure to the Japanese yen, which has been significantly impacted by Japan’s low-interest-rate environment.In a shareholder update, Metaplanet expressed concern about the yen’s vulnerability and highlighted Bitcoin’s potential as a hedge against inflation, a tool for macroeconomic resilience, and a source of long-term capital appreciation.Corporate Bitcoin Holders Start to Reap Rewards
A number of major corporate investors in Bitcoin, including Microstrategy, have already seen their profits skyrocket.As per data aggregated by Saylortracker, at current market prices of around $65,000, MicroStrategy’s position now commands a total valuation exceeding $12.57 billion.This means the company sits on tremendous unrealized profits of almost $6.5 billion on paper – reflecting a gain of almost 104% yield-to-date from an investment allocation started under Saylor back in 2020.As of now, Bitcoin is trading at around $69,000, down by more than 3% over the past day.The leading cryptocurrency is 5% away from its all-time high of $73,750 registered on March 14.

VanEck Pushes SEC to Respect Filing Queue for Ethereum ETF


VanEck, a leading New York-based fund group managing approximately $100 billion in assets, spearheads a significant debate on the approval process for spot Ethereum exchange-traded funds (ETFs) in the United States. 
The firm, which first filed for a spot Ethereum ETF in 2021, advocates for the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to honor the order of filings.
VanEck Requests SEC to Uphold First-Come, First-Serve Order Basis

Matthew Sigel, VanEck’s head of crypto research, has voiced concerns about the SEC’s current approach. The SEC currently permits multiple firms to launch their financial product, such as ETFs, simultaneously, regardless of when they filed. The regulator followed this approach and allowed the launch of all the spot Bitcoin ETFs on January 11.

“We were first to file and we expect to be first to respond to comments and first out the door. When you filed used to mean something, and it should again,” Sigel stated in an X space.

Moreover, Sigel contends that respecting the filing queue is a matter of fairness and essential for maintaining orderly market practices. 

“It creates an uneven playing field for issuers who filed earlier and had to wait longer. Those who filed months ago had to keep their applications updated and compliant for a longer period, incurring more costs and legal fees compared to later filers,” Sigel argued.

This issue comes to a head as the SEC’s 240-day review period for VanEck’s latest ether ETF bid concludes today. This is just a day before the commission is scheduled to make a decision on similar proposals by Ark Invest and 21Shares. 
Notably, until last week, VanEck CEO Jan van Eck anticipated potential rejection for their spot Ethereum ETF. He noted that despite being pioneers, both VanEck and Ark Invest are likely facing rejection. 

However, the tides have changed since the beginning of the current week. This is because Bloomberg ETF analysts Eric Balchunas and James Seyffart recently upgraded the chances of approval for spot Ethereum ETFs from 25% to a hopeful 75%. 
Similarly, prediction platforms like Polymarket have shown a significant increase in the odds of approval, which rose from 10% to 58% last week.

Additionally, the SEC has requested revisions to the spot Ethereum ETF proposals from Nasdaq and Cboe, a move seen as a crucial step towards potential approval. This development indicates a possible reconsideration of the regulatory stance towards Ethereum ETFs.

SEC engages with Ethereum ETF issuers on S-1 forms - Crypto Briefing


            
            
                            
            
                            
            
            Fox Business journalist Eleanor Terrett said on Thursday that the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) started talks with Ethereum exchange-traded fund (ETF) issuers regarding their S-1 registration forms. She cited sources who said there is still “work to do” on those forms.This could be seen as a positive development, but it suggests there might have been a previous delay in communication.In a separate post, Terrett indicated the SEC might approve the 19b-4 filings today, followed by collaboration with issuers on S-1 forms in the coming weeks or months.Commenting on Terrett’s post, Bloomberg ETF analyst James Seyffart said with significant effort, S-1 applications for spot Ethereum ETFs could be resolved within a few weeks. However, he noted that the SEC may need additional time to complete the S-1 review process.“I think that if they work extremely hard it can be done within a couple weeks but there are plenty of examples of this process taking 3+ months historically,” Seyffart suggested.Most ETF issuers, including major players like Fidelity, Bitwise, Grayscale, VanEck, Ark 21Shares, Franklin Templeton, and Invesco, submitted their amended 19b-4 filings earlier this week. Nasdaq also refiled BlackRock’s proposed Ethereum ETF yesterday.The clock ticks down as the market braces for the SEC’s verdict on spot Ethereum funds.Bloomberg analyst Eric Balchunas suggests a timeframe of around 4:00 PM ET for the SEC’s announcement on the fate of these ETFs. The decision on spot Bitcoin ETFs previously arrived slightly earlier on the designated date.Meanwhile, Ethereum’s price has surged 25% over the past seven days, trading at nearly $3,800 at press time, according to CoinGecko’s data.Experts expect that a potential spot Ethereum ETF approval could trigger a sharp price increase. However, whether Ethereum can replicate Bitcoin’s price action after the spot fund approval remains uncertain.

It ruled that the regulators failed to justify its decision to block the company from doing business.Binance.US didn’t return Cryptonews’ request for comment by press time.Florida Suspended Binance.US Amid Anti-Money Laundering Concerns
Florida cracked down on Binance.US in November, using an emergency order to suspend its money transmitter license. This action came one week after Binance founder Changpeng Zhao pleaded guilty to violating US anti-money laundering laws on Nov. 21, 2023.Despite the global Binance exchange facing action from the US government, its local affiliate continued operating within the country.“We remain fully operational and are committed to continuing to serve our customers with the same products and services as we always have,” the US affiliate said on Nov. 28.Florida Regulator’s Process Deemed Unfair
After the emergency order, Binance.US challenged Florida’s regulators. The platform argued that the order was riddled with errors, misinterpreted local laws, and would cause significant financial harm. The firm pointed to potential losses for over 170,000 Florida accounts and the dangers forced asset liquidation would cause.The judges unanimously sided with Binance.US in their ruling. They noted that the Florida Office of Financial Regulation failed to justify that the process for arriving at its decision was fair under the circumstances.“A forced and untimely sale of Florida customers’ digital assets threatens financial harm because of digital asset price fluctuations,” the court wrote. “In addition, an account holder who is forced to sell a digital asset at a price higher than a cost basis would incur unplanned and extensive tax liabilities.”The judges conclusively noted that the ESO failed to discuss alternative remedies. They also failed to explain why less harsh measures would be insufficient to address the alleged emergency.

Speculation Grows Around Potential Spot Solana ETFs


As the anticipation builds around the SEC’s potential approval of spot Ethereum (ETH) exchange-traded funds (ETFs), experts are turning their attention to the possibility of other cryptocurrencies, like Solana (SOL), gaining similar recognition.
Industry leaders are discussing whether Solana could be the next asset to see the introduction of spot ETFs, a move that could significantly impact the crypto market.
Industry Perspectives on Spot Solana ETFs

In a recent CNBC appearance, Brian Kelly, CEO of digital currency investment firm BKCM, highlighted Solana’s potential, noting that Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Solana are the top three cryptocurrencies for this cycle. Furthermore, Kelly suggested that if the SEC approves spot Ethereum ETFs, it would provide clearer regulations for Ethereum and the broader market. This potentially leads to the approval of more spot crypto ETFs, including Solana.

ETF analyst James Seyffart of Bloomberg Intelligence offered insights in response to Kelly’s speculation. Seyffart emphasized the regulatory hurdles Solana faces, particularly due to its current classification as a security by the SEC.

“Based on current precedent/needs — Will happen within a few years of getting a CFTC regulated futures market. But Congress & Market structure bills like FIT21 could make it happen quicker. I think a SOL ETF would see most demand vs other digital assets (aside from BTC & ETH). But SEC isn’t dancing around SOL’s status like they have ETH. Those lawsuits against Coinbase and Kraken and others flat out say ‘Solana is a security’. Which could very easily make this a very rocky road,” Seyffart noted.

Despite the challenges, Seyffart acknowledged the demand for Solana ETFs. However, he suggested that Litecoin (LTC) might see ETF approval first, albeit with less market interest. Crypto journalist Laura Shin added that while Litecoin might have “little regulatory baggage,” Solana makes sense from a usage and fundamentals perspective.

The crypto community eagerly awaits the SEC’s official decision on spot Ethereum ETFs, which could set the stage for future approvals. ETF analyst Eric Balchunas speculated that an announcement might come around 16:00 today. His prediction was based on the timing of the SEC’s approval of spot Bitcoin ETFs in January.

WisdomTree offers low-cost, physically-backed Bitcoin and Ethereum ETPs on the LSE.



The SEC’s approval of Bitcoin ETFs in the US has led to adoption by other countries.




In a move that could significantly expand access to cryptocurrencies for institutional investors in the UK, WisdomTree received approval from the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) to list its Physical Bitcoin (BTCW) and Ethereum (ETHW) exchange-traded products (ETPs) on the London Stock Exchange (LSE).



The listing, expected for May 28th, comes just two months after the LSE’s initial announcement and positions WisdomTree as one of the first issuers to secure a crypto ETP listing with the FCA.



These physically-backed ETPs boast a competitive Management Expense Ratio (MER) of 0.35%, making them among the most affordable institutional-grade crypto exposure in Europe.



Reacting to this news, Alexis Marinof, Head of Europe at WisdomTree, emphasized that this listing is essential for industry growth and will increase crypto participation in the UK market. He stated:




“FCA approval in this respect could result in greater institutional adoption of the asset class, as many professional investors have been unable to gain exposure to Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies due to regulatory limitations and uncertainty – we would expect FCA approval of our crypto ETPs’ prospectus to remove those barriers to entry.”




WisdomTree has pioneered institutional-grade crypto products in Europe, launching its first Physical Bitcoin ETP in 2019. The firm currently offers a diverse portfolio of eight physically backed crypto ETPs, including both single-asset and diversified crypto baskets.









The recent wave of regulatory approvals for crypto products around the world appears to be driven, in part, by the success of Bitcoin ETFs in the US, which saw significant inflows following their launch. This has prompted other financial centers, like Hong Kong, to fast-track their own crypto investment offerings.



Notably, Hong Kong recently approved Bitcoin and Ether ETFs with features like in-kind transfers and multiple fiat currency denominations, allowing for more convenient investment options. However, despite these functionalities, Hong Kong’s ETFs attracted a relatively modest $22.5 million on their first day of trading, highlighting the nascent stage of institutional adoption in this market.

‘Quite Likely’ Bitcoin Explodes to Six Figures This Cycle, Predicts Analyst Kevin Svenson - Here’s His Outlook - The Daily Hodl


								Analyst and trader Kevin Svenson is expressing bullish sentiment on Bitcoin (BTC) amid a double-digit rise in the flagship crypto asset’s price over the past seven days.
Svenson tells his 78,400 YouTube subscribers that Bitcoin is on a parabolic trend that started in the fourth quarter of 2023 and could rally to a target of around $90,000.










According to the analyst and trader, Bitcoin could then surge higher following a correction that would potentially come after hitting the initial $90,000 target.
“So it’s not the end of the cycle when we hit $90,000 breakdown… it is simply just an area to cool off to go sideways for re-accumulation, healthy price action, let coins change hands. Let a whole new group of investors get in on that sideways action. That’s healthy. And then look to run up again…
…and yes we could probably go to six figures in this cycle. It’s quite likely that we do.”

Svenson also says that Bitcoin could against his expectations.
“Is it possible that we don’t go that high? That’s also possible – we hit a price target slightly lower than $90,000 and we break the trend. That’s also a break of the parabolic trend which might mean we’re going sideways for a while before going up again. There are a lot of possibilities.”

Why Toncoin has not joined Bitcoin, Ethereum, in the latest crypto rally - AMBCrypto



Toncoin was underperforming, trading at $6.2 at press time.
TON’s market cap was $22 billion, ranking in the top 10 despite recent price drops.

Toncoin [TON], the native cryptocurrency of the Toncoin network, is stubbornly sitting out the current crypto rally. 
While most major altcoins have surged thanks to Bitcoin’s [BTC] recovery above $70K and the Ethereum [ETH] spot ETF hype, TON has fallen by 5.8%, now trading at a disappointing $6.2. What gives?
TON is struggling, but it’s not all bad
Notably, TON has been struggling to join the crypto rally. Despite its weak performance, it boasts a solid $22 billion market cap, placing it in the top 10 cryptocurrencies. 
So, while the price action might be sluggish, it’s still holding a significant place in the crypto ecosystem.
Santiment has pointed out TON’s impressive growth in the past six months. Specifically, the number of non-empty wallets holding TON has shot up by 110%, reaching 16,800. 
This suggested that there was still a lot of interest and belief in Toncoin’s potential.
TON’s yearly gains are still among the highest in the market, registering over 220%. 
Moreover, data from DeFiLlama shows that the altcoin’s Total Value Locked (TVL) has surged to over $289 million, showcasing the widespread adoption and prominence of The Open Network’s dApps.
Technical analysis
TON/USDt 5-day trading chart displayed a volatile trading pattern, with the price experiencing several significant fluctuations. 
Toncoin reached a high near $6.75 and a low around $6.20, indicating a trading range of $0.55 over the past five days.
Source: TradingView
After reaching its peak, Toncoin experienced a sharp decline, thanks to a strong sell-off or profit-taking near the highs. 
The price stabilized somewhat after reaching lows, suggesting some level of support around the $6.20 mark.
TON’s trading volume has been relatively consistent, with spikes correlating closely with significant price movements. This means that there is active trading during periods of high volatility.
Over the five days, the most consistent support level appeared at around $6.20, and the price bounced back multiple times due to the bears staying largely in control.

Is your portfolio green? Check out the TON Profit Calculator

Due to the strong bearish pattern, it has witnessed, TON will likely fail to hold on to the $6.2 support level, thereby plunging below $6 or even $5.5. But if it holds on, a modest rise to $6.5 might be on the horizon.
So, TON still has a chance to join the rally.

Swimming Cat (SWIMCAT) Will Surge 15,000% Ahead of Bitrue Listing, Looks to Challenge Shiba Inu and Dogecoin



                    

Swimming Cat (SWIMCAT) could become a viral memecoin, like Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE).



Swimming Cat (SWIMCAT), a Solana memecoin that was launched today, is aiming to challenge other memecoin giants, such as Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE).




Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Swimming Cat presents a similar opportunity.



Swimming Cat has a market cap below $15,000 at the moment, meaning that when it just reaches a modest market cap of $400,000-$800,000, early investors would generate returns of 2,000%-5,000% in a matter of days or hours.



The exciting memecoin is poised to rally 11,000% in the coming two days before it will be listed on Bitrue – a massive cryptocurrency exchange – and Swimming Cat could potentially reach a multi-million dollar market cap within a few weeks.




Currently, Swimming Cat can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jupiter and Raydium, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days.



To buy Swimming Cat on these platforms, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Swimming Cat by entering its contract address – 2NsBvNNCzDDfhuzq6D55mCyzg6zt43rfdjnzTAg14Kr4 – in the receiving field.



In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price.



If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner.




The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum.



This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like SWIMCAT.

Nvidia Smashes Q1 Targets, Unveils 10-to-1 Stock Split


On Wednesday, American technology giant Nvidia (NVDA) announced its Q1 2024 earnings report. The company’s performance exceeded expectations for both sales and earnings, resulting in a significant rise in its stock price.
The company’s performance highlights the ongoing robust demand for artificial intelligence (AI) chips, with notable gains in its data center sales and networking parts.
Nvidia’s Strong Q1 2024 Earnings Boost AI Market Confidence

Nvidia reported revenue of $26.04 billion, surpassing the expected $24.65 billion. The chipmaker also saw a significant increase in net income, reaching $14.88 billion, or $5.98 per share. In comparison, in Q1 2023, Nvidia’s net income was $2.04 billion, or $0.82 per share.
Nvidia’s data center category, including AI chips and components for AI servers, saw a 427% increase in revenue to $22.56 billion. Colette Kress, Nvidia’s Chief Financial Officer (CFO), attributed this growth to shipments of Hopper graphics processors, including the H100 GPU. She highlighted Meta’s Lama 3 announcement, which utilized 24,000 H100 GPUs, as a key driver.

Networking revenue also surged, reaching $3.17 billion, over three times higher than Q1 on the previous year. Nvidia’s InfiniBand products significantly contributed to this growth by supporting the connection of vast chip clusters.
Additionally, Nvidia’s gaming revenue rose 18% to $2.65 billion, driven by strong demand for its hardware. The company also reported $427 million in professional visualization sales and $329 million in automotive sales.
CEO Jensen Huang emphasized that demand for Nvidia’s AI chips remains robust. The company anticipates revenue from its next-generation AI chip, Blackwell, later this year.
According to its official website, the Blackwell GPU architecture features six transformative technologies for accelerated computing. These technologies will help unlock breakthroughs in data processing, engineering simulation, electronic design automation, computer-aided drug design, quantum computing, and generative AI.

“We are poised for our next wave of growth. The Blackwell platform is in full production and forms the foundation for trillion-parameter-scale generative AI,” Huang said.

Nvidia repurchased $7.7 billion of shares during the quarter and paid $98 million in dividends. On the same day, Nvidia announced a 10-to-1 forward stock split to make stock ownership more accessible.
Each record holder of common stock as of June 6, 2024, will receive nine additional shares to be distributed after market close on June 7, 2024. Split-adjusted trading will begin on June 10, 2024.

Nvidia also increased its quarterly cash dividend from $0.04 to $0.10 per share on a pre-split basis. Post-split, the dividend will be $0.01 per share. Looking ahead, Nvidia projects $28 billion in revenue for this quarter.
NVDA’s price skyrocketed after the announcement, surpassing the $1,000 mark. During the US stock market after hours, at 17:32 ET, NVDA traded at $1,019. Yet, its price has now been corrected to $1,007 at the time of writing.

Optimism surrounding Nvidia’s performance extends to the crypto market, particularly AI-related tokens. In the past seven days, some major AI tokens, such as Fetch.AI (FET), Render (RNDR), SingularityNET (AGIX), and Bittensor (TAO), enjoyed an increase of roughly 10% to 20%. However, shortly after the earnings report release, these tokens entered correction phases, signaling sell-the-news actions from the investors.

Binance Tax Case in Nigeria Adjourned, Bribery Claims Emerge


							

Nigerian court postpones tax evasion trial of Binance



Binance executives accused of facilitating illicit flows, face laundering charges



Binance CEO alleges bribery demands by Nigerian authorities, sparking dispute




A Nigerian court has adjourned a tax evasion case against Binance, the cryptocurrency exchange, until next month. The postponement came after authorities failed to produce Tigran Gambaryan, a Binance executive charged in the case, in court on Wednesday; as reported by Reuters.



Neither Nigerian authorities nor Binance offered an explanation for Gambaryan’s absence. Moses Ideho, a lawyer for the revenue service, said Gambaryan was expected to be brought to court by the Nigerian prison service. Judge Emeka Nwite then set June 14 as the date for the possible arraignment of Binance and Gambaryan.



Gambaryan and another Binance executive, Nadeem Anjarwalla, were detained by Nigerian authorities following an official meeting where Binance was accused of facilitating a $26 billion illicit flow. The executives, whose passports were seized, filed a lawsuit against the Nigerian authorities alleging human rights violations.



The case escalated further when Binance CEO Richard Teng accused Nigerian authorities of demanding a $140 million bribe, a claim the authorities dismissed as a “diversionary tactic.”









Ginger Onwusibe, Chairman of the House of Representatives Committee on Financial Crimes, rejected Teng’s allegations, stating that Binance was attempting to blackmail the authorities. “There were absolutely no solicitations or demands of any kind made by representatives of the Committee towards Binance at any point,” he said.



Binance and its executives face four counts of tax evasion, accused of failing to register with Nigeria’s Federal Inland Revenue Service. They are also charged with laundering more than $35 million, with a trial on those charges scheduled for Thursday.

Is Binance Preparing to List a New Altcoin? Here is the Surprise Altcoin at the Focus of the Claims! - Bitcoin Sistemi


While the altcoins listed by Binance, the world's largest cryptocurrency exchange, are closely followed by investors, there has been a new development regarding the altcoin listing.
Chinese cryptocurrency journalist Wu Blockchain said in his post that some monitoring robots detected that Binance added a new Toncoin (TON) port on May 23.


Stating that this situation seems to be a signal for Binance to list TON, but it is just a prediction, Wu said:

“Some monitoring robots detected that Binance added a new Toncoin (TON) port on May 23.
This interface tracking is only a preliminary estimate and is not definitive of the final TON listing.
TON had previously stated that it had a confidentiality agreement with Binance, but was unable to disclose details.”

The tracking page cited by Wu Blockchain said, “Binance TON information comes from the official API, no announcement has been released yet, we will have to wait and see whether Binance will list it.”





TON continues to trade at $6.47 at the time of writing.

House passes crypto regulation bill, eyes Senate approval


The U.S. House of Representatives approved the Financial Innovation and Technology for the 21st Century Act (FIT21), a bill designed to regulate the cryptocurrency market. 



The bipartisan vote on Wednesday resulted in 279 members, including 71 Democrats, endorsing the legislation, while 136 opposed it. 



This bill, now proceeding to the Senate, could forge a new regulatory framework for digital assets, enhancing the Commodity Futures Trading Commission’s (CFTC) oversight.



It also introduces guidelines for the secondary market trading of digital commodities initially offered as investment contracts, in addition to addressing stablecoins and anti-money laundering protocols. 

	
	
	
	


Despite the White House’s critique of the bill for lacking adequate consumer and investor safeguards, the administration has indicated a readiness to work towards a regulatory framework for digital assets.



FIT21’s passage signals a potential shift in the Congressional perspective on cryptocurrencies and their influence on the financial sector. 



FIT21 has encountered opposition from SEC Chair Gary Gensler, who contends that the bill might lead to regulatory loopholes and compromise investor protection. 



House Financial Services Committee Ranking Democrat Maxine Waters has also expressed concerns, arguing that the bill could overburden the CFTC and not provide sufficient regulatory authority.

Bitcoin (BTC), Ether (ETH) in Stasis as SEC ETF Decision Looms, Nvidia (NVDA) Hits Record High

"The SEC should approve U.S.-listed ETH ETFs today. Hours before the Bitcoin ETF approval, SEC Gensler tweeted that crypto investors should consider all potential risks before making any investment.

Research Firm Boosts Ethereum Spot ETF Approval Probability To 90%: But Will It Be A 'Sell The News' Event? - BlackRock (NYSE:BLK) - Benzinga

Cryptocurrency research firm 10x Research raised the chances of the SEC greenlighting the Ethereum ETH spot ETF later today to 90%.What Happened: In its latest newsletter, 10x Research deemed the approval a "formality". It noted that an X post by SEC Chair Gary Gensler cautioning investors of potential risks–similar to the one before the approval of Bitcoin BTC/USD ETFs in January–could come around 9 a.m. EDT. This is typically a sign of the approval being immediate.The analytics platform highlighted that the Grayscale Ethereum Trust ETHE has narrowed its discount to its net asset value (NAV) to 8% from 30% a week ago."An 8% discount implies at least a 90% probability that an ETF would be approved," the firm pointed out. The research firm also foresaw the approval becoming a "sell the news" event. These fears aligned with the moves of Ethereum co-founder Jeffrey Wilcke who transferred nearly 10,000 ETH to cryptocurrency exchange Kraken. Why It Matters: The mood in the cryptocurrency market was upbeat as VanEck’s spot Ether ETF was listed by the Depository Trust and Clearing Corporation (DTCC) — a necessary precursor to SEC approval. Note that the final decision on VanEck's application is expected to come from the SEC later today.Alongside, a slew of other ETF hopefuls, including BlackRock Inc. BLK amended their 19b-4 filings for spot Ether ETFs.Meanwhile, the chances of approval on decentralized prediction market Polymarket jumped to 67%Price Action: At the time of writing, Ether was exchanging hands at $3,785.04, following marginal gains of 0.83% in the last 24 hours, according to data from Benzinga Pro. Read Next: Dogecoin Reversal Imminent, Says This Analyst — Predicts Over 30% UpsideMarket News and Data brought to you by Benzinga APIs© 2024 Benzinga.com.

                        Crypto investor and trader Brian Kelly has suggested that Solana (SOL) could potentially become the next cryptocurrency to have a spot exchange-traded fund (ETF) in the United States.On a recent episode of CNBC’s ‘Fast Money’, Kelly, who also serves as the founder and CEO of the BKCM Digital Asset Fund, posed the question, “The trade now is, who’s next?”He then suggested, “You’ve got to think about Solana as probably the next one. Bitcoin, Ethereum and Solana are probably the big three for this cycle.”The speculation comes just a day before the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) is set to decide on at least one proposed spot Ether (ETH) ETF.Solana ETF Might Not Come Next
However, not everyone shares Kelly’s optimism.Nate Geraci, president of The ETF Store, expressed skepticism, stating that a spot Solana ETF might not materialize until a Solana futures product is listed on a major exchange or until Congress establishes a clear regulatory framework for cryptocurrencies beyond Bitcoin and Ethereum.James Seyffart, an ETF analyst at Bloomberg, echoed Geraci’s sentiments, predicting that the launch of a spot Solana ETF could be years away, contingent upon regulatory milestones such as approval from the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC).Despite the differing opinions, Seyffart highlighted the potential demand for a spot Solana ETF, suggesting it could surpass other digital assets outside of Bitcoin and Ethereum.However, regulatory hurdles loom large.The SEC, under the leadership of Gary Gensler, has previously categorized Solana as a security in lawsuits against Coinbase and Kraken, adding complexity to the path for potential ETF applicants.Adam Cochran, a partner at Cinneamhain Ventures, offered a contrasting perspective, suggesting that either Litecoin (LTC) or Dogecoin (DOGE) might beat Solana to the ETF race due to perceived cleaner regulatory pathways, despite lower demand compared to Solana.While few ETF issuers have openly discussed the possibility of filing for a spot Solana ETF, Franklin Templeton, a trillion-dollar asset management firm, recently praised Solana and its founder Anatoly Yakovenko.This has fueled speculation about the firm’s potential interest in launching a Solana ETF in the future.Fidelity Files Amended S-1 Application with SEC
As reported, Fidelity made an amended S-1 application to SEC for its spot Ether ETF yesterday. The updated application specifies that the underlying Ether tokens of the ETF will not be staked.S-1 filings are mandatory registration forms required by the SEC for launching publicly traded securities products in the United States.The speculation around the approval of spot Ether ETFs has also provided a boost to spot Bitcoin ETFs, which saw an uptick in inflows on Tuesday.BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) witnessed a substantial inflow of $290 million on May 21, marking a reversal in the trend of zero or minimal inflows observed over the past six weeks.The recent influx of funds into BlackRock’s ETF represents the highest level since April 5, eclipsing the cumulative inflows witnessed over the past 21 trading days.On May 21, BTC reached a six-week high of $71,600, but it subsequently dipped below the $70,000 level during early trading on May 22, currently trading at $69,444 at the time of writing.

How Rumors About Bybit’s Insolvency Sparked Panic


Recent rumors suggesting the insolvency of crypto exchange Bybit have sent shockwaves through the crypto community, escalating panic and speculation. 
A significant error on Arkham’s on-chain analysis platform mistakenly showed a drastic drop in Bybit’s assets, triggering anxiety.
Bybit Gives Clarification Regarding the Insolvency Rumors

Initially fueled by the alarming graphical representation, the rumors led to a substantial outflow of funds. Reports from DefiLlama co-founder 0xngmi indicate withdrawals exceeding $50 million. Despite this, 0xngmi contextualized the situation, stating that the withdrawals are nothing compared to Bybit’s total assets.
In response to these unsettling events, a Bybit spokesperson clarified the situation in an interview with BeInCrypto. The Bybit spokesperson pointed out that the rumors were baseless and possibly propagated by individuals dissatisfied with Bybit’s stringent compliance measures.

“We were surprised to unexpectedly receive an inquiry from some private talks. Bybit is very stable and safe with all your assets,” the spokesperson told BeInCrypto. 

Furthermore, Bybit has encouraged its users and stakeholders to refer to its official Proof of Reserves (POR) report. This report confirms the stability of its asset base, along with data from other reputable on-chain analysis platforms such as Nansen and DefiLlama.

This incident occurs against a backdrop of heightened vigilance within the crypto community. Following the high-profile collapses of several crypto firms in 2022, including FTX and Celsius, there is a pervasive atmosphere of caution and skepticism about the solvency of crypto exchanges.
Historically, such rumors have not been confined to Bybit alone. In December 2023, similar concerns were raised about another exchange, MEXC, following the mysterious deletion of the “MEXC_CEO” Twitter account. Consequently, user complaints about frozen funds on social platforms intensified worries about the financial health of crypto exchanges.

The rapid response from Bybit and the clarification provided should reassure its users and investors. Nevertheless, this incident highlights the fragile nature of trust in the volatile crypto sector and the speed at which misinformation can spread, affecting market stability and investor confidence.

Bitcoin's Next Big Move: Analysts Predict A Breakout At $71,500


																Bitcoin, the world’s most popular cryptocurrency, appears poised for a major move, but the direction remains shrouded in mystery. Analysts are divided on whether a bullish breakout or an extended consolidation period lies ahead.

	Related Reading


Reaching New Highs: Euphoric Bulls On The Horizon?
Renowned crypto analyst Checkmate has ignited a spark of optimism with his “Euphoric Bull” theory. According to Checkmate, a surge to a new all-time high could signal a critical shift in market sentiment. This type of bull phase would represent a significant acceleration in bullish momentum, potentially leading to a steeper price increase.
Checkmate’s theory hinges on the Market Value to Realized Value (MVRV) ratio, a metric that compares the current market value of Bitcoin to the total value paid to acquire all Bitcoins in circulation. Historically, when the MVRV ratio climbs above one standard deviation of its average, it has often preceded a shift to a “Euphoric Bull” phase.

However, Checkmate warns that Bitcoin doesn’t always follow the script on the first try. The market often exhibits cautious behavior, with Bitcoin potentially attempting to breach this key MVRV level multiple times before a decisive breakout.

Bitcoin’s recent consolidation period comes after a surge that saw the alpha crypto reach a six-week high of $71,950. While a slight pullback has occurred, Bitcoin is still trading comfortably near the $70,000 level, with a healthy daily trading volume. This price movement suggests a potential pause before the next significant move, making the current moment a tense waiting game for both traders and investors.
Breakout Or Consolidation? A Bullish Dilemma
Crypto analyst Rekt Capital has emerged as a key voice in the ongoing debate. Rekt Capital believes a weekly candle closing above $71,500 could be the catalyst for a significant breakout. This milestone, if achieved, could trigger a surge in bullish momentum, propelling Bitcoin towards a notable uptrend.
BTCUSD trading at $69,460 on the weekly chart: TradingView.com
However, Rekt Capital also acknowledges the possibility of an extended consolidation phase. Historically, Bitcoin has exhibited a tendency to consolidate within its re-accumulation range for several weeks before experiencing a breakout. This extended consolidation, Rekt Capital argues, would bring Bitcoin closer to aligning with historical halving cycles, events that have historically preceded major bull runs.

Bitcoin Price Prediction
Meanwhile, other analysts are predicting a potential banner year for the world’s leading cryptocurrency in 2025. The high-end prediction of $168,459 represents a staggering potential increase, fueled by factors like historical price trends and the upcoming Bitcoin halving cycle. Buoying this optimism are technical indicators pointing towards a “Bullish” market sentiment with a hefty dose of “Extreme Greed.”

However, a dose of reality is necessary. The wide range between the predicted high and low ($69,971) underscores the inherent uncertainty in these forecasts. Bitcoin’s notorious volatility, evident in the recent 4.47% price swings within just 30 days, further complicates things. While this level of greed suggests investor confidence, it can also be a warning sign of a potential market correction on the horizon.

Solana: The Dark Horse in the Crypto ETF Race as Ethereum Surges


							

Brian Kelly predicts Solana as next possible crypto spot ETF.



Solana ETF approval faces regulatory hurdles, experts say.



Some experts favor Litecoin or Dogecoin for the next ETF due to their simpler mechanisms.




Crypto investor Brian Kelly suggested Solana (SOL) could be the next cryptocurrency to secure a spot exchange-traded fund (ETF) in the US, following the SEC’s anticipated decision on a spot Ether ETF.







Kelly, who is also the CEO of BKCM Digital Asset Fund, believes Solana is one of the “big three” coins alongside Bitcoin and Ethereum. However, some industry analysts disagree.



Approval for a spot Solana ETF hinges on a futures product being listed on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME) or the establishment of a clear regulatory framework from Congress. Currently, only Bitcoin and Ether futures have been approved.



Even if approved, experts believe there would be significant demand for a Solana ETF, potentially surpassing all other digital assets except Bitcoin and Ether. However, the SEC’s classification of Solana as a security in past lawsuits could pose challenges.









Others like Adam Cochran of Cinneamhain Ventures believe Litecoin or Dogecoin might be next due to a “cleaner path” with proof-of-work mechanisms similar to Bitcoin.



While few ETF issuers have spoken of a Solana ETF, Franklin Templeton’s recent praise for Solana has sparked speculation. Additionally, Bitwise’s Matt Hougan has called Solana the “crypto asset of 2024” due to its institutional potential.Market analysts who predicted that Solana (SOL) would surpass Ether (ETH) in the upcoming bull run are facing a reality check as ETH stages an impressive surge. On Monday, Ether (ETH) recorded gains exceeding 19%, boosting its market capitalization by a significant $70 billion. This surge brings ETH’s overall market cap to $439 billion, narrowing the gap with Solana’s total market value.

VanEck Throws Down the Gauntlet: First to File, First to Launch Ether ETF?


							

VanEck pushes for first-to-file advantage in ether ETF race.



SEC faces calls for fair assessment as multiple firms vie for approval.



The SEC is set to make its decision on the ETH ETF on May 23.




Matthew Sigel, VanEck’s head of digital asset research, asserted to the SEC that the first firm to file for the first ether ETF should be the first firm to launch it. 



This benefits VanEck, the New-York-based fund group, which manages $100 billion in assets. It filed for a spot ether ETF in the US in 2021 and then refiled in July 2023. 



The SEC had 240 days to review VanEck’s application, which means the regulator was expected to rule by May 21; one day before the Ark Invest/21Shares proposal. Ark Invest is one of several firms seeking to launch Ether ETFs, including BlackRock, Fidelity, Grayscale, Bitwise, Invesco, and Hashdex.









Over the past few weeks, the SEC, stock exchanges, and fund issuers have extensively engaged. A Tuesday X post came from VanEck: “SEC comments rolling in.”



Sigel, speaking at an X Space on Wednesday, made VanEck’s case: 




“VanEck was the first to file our S-1 for this spot ethereum ETF, and we fully expect to get our comments back first and go first. The SEC should let their process work and make that happen. The comments rolling in for me is a good sign.”




The first-come, first-served principle is the only fair one, as the VanEck executive emphasized. Sigel added that he fundamentally disagreed “with the whole lining everyone up and saying go at the same time; that’s never how the process works,” adding that it “just always pits the incumbents over the smaller entrants.”The price of Ethereum (ETH) has been on the rise since the chances of approval of spot ETH ETFs were increased by analysts from 25% to 75%.

Biden in a Dogs World (BIDDOG) to Explode 14,000% Ahead of KuCoin Listing, as Shiba Inu, Bonk and Dogecoin Lag



                    

Early investors in memecoins like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Bonk (BONK) and Dogecoin (DOGE) made astronomical returns, and Biden in a Dogs World (BIDDOG) presents a similar opportunity for a limited time.



Biden in a Dogs World (BIDDOG), a newly launched Solana memecoin, is poised to explode over 14,000% in a matter of days, as former Shiba Inu (SHIB), Bonk (BONK) and Dogecoin (DOGE) investors pour funds into this new token.




BIDDOG will be listed on KuCoin, one of the largest centralized exchanges in the world, within a few days – and this is a massively bullish development for the token, as millions of new investors will easily be able to buy Biden in a Dogs World.



Currently, Biden in a Dogs World can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jupiter and Raydium, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days.



To buy BIDDOG on these platforms, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Biden in a Dogs World by entering its contract address – bUv1o6DFK5Wa7V1SY2HoFTUmaZSQ58eKqk5rKxvWuZr – in the receiving field.




BIDDOG currently has a market cap of just under $13,000, with over $4,000 in locked liquidity, meaning it has huge upside potential.



Early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and Bonk (BONK) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price.



If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner.

Decentralized AI Platform Bittensor Gains 15% Amid Unconfirmed Grayscale Rumors - Decrypt

We do the research, you get the alpha!Get exclusive reports and access to key insights on airdrops, NFTs, and more! Subscribe now to Alpha Reports and up your game!Go to Alpha ReportsDecentralized AI project Bittensor has seen its native token, TAO, gain 15% in the past day. It seems to have been helped along by an unconfirmed rumor that longstanding digital asset manager Grayscale plans to register a new trust that tracks the token. But that's not the only recent news for the project.At the time of writing on early Thursday morning, the Bittensor price has climbed 15% in the past day to trade for $483.10. That's a 24% gain compared to this time last week, according to CoinGecko data.That makes TAO the best performing asset in the top 100 on CoinGecko at the time of writing, beating ETH meme coin darling PepeCoin. PEPE and other meme OGs like Dogecoin and Shiba Inu, have all seen sizable gains as investors wait with bated breath to see if the Securities and Exchange Commission will approve a spot Ethereum ETF to trade.A pseudonymous Crypto Twitter user, CEYEBER—who founded the official Bittensor Community Channel on Telegram—claims to have had the Grayscale rumor "confirmed by close sources." But if it's real, there's still no sign of it in Securities and Exchange Commission filings.If the TAO offering were going to be another close-end fund available over-the-counter to wealthy investors—like the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust was before it was converted to a spot ETF and the rest of the firm's single asset funds still are—then there would likely be a Regulation D filing. More recently, in March, Grayscale filed to establish a Grayscale Bitcoin Mini Trust as a new spot BTC offering with an S-1 registration.Neither type of filing has been submitted at the time of writing. In fact, "Bittensor" doesn't appear in any SEC filings at all going back to 2001. But that doesn't mean it's impossible. Grayscale did not immediately respond to a request for comment from Decrypt.But the rumor isn't the only bullish news for the decentralized AI project.The Taobot, a component of the Bittensor ecosystem, has been having a good week. On Tuesday, the team announced it had been accepted as one of the first projects to join Akash Network's LlaMa 3 API beta.Akash network made a big splash last month when it announced that its chat supports supports Llama 3, the newest open source model from Meta AI."Test the newest model from Meta AI for yourself without creating an account," the project wrote on Twitter at the time. "Completely free and permissionless."The Taobot team has also started working with the Bittensor Subnet 15 project, Blockchain Insights to allow users to to use simple language to analyze blockchain data.The subnet has been working to organize blockchain data across multiple networks, like TK and TK, in the interest of making complex data queries more efficient."Our integration will empower users to perform diverse blockchain queries, from simple transactions to DeFi protocol analytics and NFT exchanges," the Taobot team wrote on Twitter yesterday.

Spot Solana ($SOL) ETFs: The Next Frontier in Cryptocurrency Investments? | Cryptoglobe


                                
On 22 May 2024 when Brian Kelly, a notable crypto investor and CNBC’s ‘Fast Money’ trader, suggested that Solana (SOL) could be the next cryptocurrency to get a spot exchange-traded fund (ETF) in the United States. Kelly’s prediction has ignited a lively debate among industry experts and market observers.



Kelly is a financial analyst and television personality known for his expertise in cryptocurrencies and blockchain technology. He is the founder and CEO of BKCM LLC, an investment firm focused on digital currencies. Kelly is also a frequent contributor to CNBC, where he provides analysis and commentary on financial markets, with a particular focus on cryptocurrency trends and investment strategies. He has authored “The Bitcoin Big Bang: How Alternative Currencies Are About to Change the World,” which explores the potential of Bitcoin and other digital currencies to revolutionize the financial industry.



According to a report by Cointelegraph, during the CNBC post-market talk show Fast Money, Kelly expressed his belief that Solana might be the next major cryptocurrency to be featured in a spot ETF. “You’ve got to think about Solana as probably the next one. Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Solana are probably the big three for this cycle,” Kelly remarked.











            
            

            
            

            
            

        

Not everyone shares Kelly’s optimism. Nate Geraci, president of The ETF Store, countered that a spot Solana ETF is unlikely unless there is a Solana futures product listed on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange or a robust cryptocurrency regulatory framework is established by Congress. 



James Seyffart, a Bloomberg ETF analyst, echoed Geraci’s caution. Seyffart suggested that a spot Solana ETF would require a Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC)-regulated market, which he believes could happen within a few years. He noted that such an ETF could see significant demand, second only to Bitcoin and Ether. However, he also pointed out that the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has previously classified Solana as a security in lawsuits against Coinbase and Kraken, potentially complicating future applications.







Contrary to Kelly’s and Seyffart’s views, Adam Cochran, partner at Cinneamhain Ventures, argued that either Litecoin (LTC) or Dogecoin (DOGE) would be more likely candidates for the next spot ETF.







At the time of writing (8:47 a.m. UTC on May 23), SOL is trading at around $177.31, down 1.6% in the past 24-hour period. In the year-to-date period, SOL is up 70% vs USD.

Samson Mow, former Blockstream CSO and now the chief executive officer at Bitcoin adoption-focused company Jan3, is a radical Bitcoin maximalist.As the deadline for the SEC to reveal its decision on spot Ethereum ETFs is drawing closer, Mow began to slam Ethereum-based ETFs. In a recent tweet, this “$1 million Bitcoin” advocate wrote that he is expecting them to be beaten by Bitcoin-based ones.Besides, he believes now is the last time for holders to sell Ethereum at a good price against Bitcoin."Last chance to sell ETH above 0.05 BTC"Samson Mow tweeted that he does not believe that the potential approval of Ethereum funds by the SEC regulator is bullish since, according to him, even if approved, spot Ethereum-based ETFs will “undoubtedly massively underperform Bitcoin ETFs.”For those who are in doubt, the Bitcoin maximalist suggested comparing demand for both BTC and ETH on other markets and said it is important to consider that Ethereum will not give staking rewards.Mow concluded his tweet by saying that now is “the last chance to sell ETH above 0.05 BTC.” In the comments to his root tweet, Samson added that he expects the news of the potential approval to become one of the biggest “sell the news events” this year.When a commentator pointed out that there is no company of the scale of MicroStrategy, which is acquiring Ethereum now in the same amounts as Michael Saylor’s company, is accumulating Bitcoin.Contrary to Mow, Bitcoiner and VC investor Anthony Pompliano believes that the potential approval of Ethereum ETFs by the SEC could become “the last dam to be broken” before the U.S. approves the entire cryptocurrency space.Bitcoin ETFs keep seeing inflowsAnalytics account on X @spotonchain has revealed a recent update on spot Bitcoin ETF flows.

Andrew Tate hints Ethereum could hit this price


    Although the cryptocurrency community is familiar with Andrew Tate’s love for Bitcoin (BTC), the social media personality and former professional kickboxer also seems bullish on the market’s largest altcoin – Ethereum (ETH) – as he recently suggested it would surpass an important price level.



Indeed, true to his style of communication, the popular influencer with a massive following promised his followers on social media platform X (formerly Twitter) that he would call them all “losers” if Ethereum hits the price of $4,000, according to his X post on May 22.



At the same time, Tate shared his post from early March, when he correctly predicted that Bitcoin would reach $70,000 and, as promised, told his audience they were losers when the flagship decentralized finance (DeFi) asset, indeed, crossed this important psychological barrier.











Indeed, his enthusiasm seems to stem from the expectations that the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) might approve the first spot Ethereum exchange-traded fund (ETF) any day now, which have also sparked a price rally. 



Andrew Tate net worth



Elsewhere, in April, Tate asked his followers if he should “buy 10,000,000 of bitcoin” (offering only ‘yes’ options), indicating plans to buy $10 million worth of Bitcoin, adding up to the estimated Andrew Tate net worth between $4 million and $12 million, most of which comes from cars he owns with his brother Tristan Tate.







Furthermore, he has also claimed to have earned about $85 million on “Defi land” during the previous bull run, acknowledging that there might be worthwhile digital assets out there and inviting his audience to take a guess at what these valuable crypto assets were this time around.







Andrew Tate Twitter teachings



As a reminder, the influencer often uses X to propagate his often controversial ideas among his supporters, and he has also revealed his Bitcoin dollar-cost averaging (DCA) strategy, according to which he has been buying BTC “every single week without fail” since 2018.







More recently, Tate announced he was going to completely abandon fiat money and buy over $100 million worth of Bitcoin after he touted the largest asset in the crypto market as the only acceptable monetary and investment choice, as Finbold reported on May 16 and April 29.







Meanwhile, Ethereum, which appears to be his most recent crypto recommendation, was at press time trading at $3,810.13, getting closer to Tate’s predicted price as it advances 1.53% on the day, 26.38% across the week, and 20.91% in the past month, as per data on May 23.



That said, doing one’s own research, weighing all the risks, and keeping up with any relevant Ethereum news is critical when investing in the asset, as the situation in this sector can sometimes change unexpectedly.

Bitcoin (BTC) Price Rally, Dogecoin (DOGE) Advancement, Ripple (XRP) Predictions: Bits Recap May 23


																TL;DR

BTC’s price climbed above $71,000 due to optimism about Ethereum ETF approval, resulting in a 6% weekly and 13% monthly increase, but then retraced to $69,500.
DOGE’s value ascended as well, briefly surpassing $0.17 and achieving a market cap near $25 billion. Significant metrics rose, with 85% of holders in profit.
XRP’s price saw a slight increase with predictions of further gains due to bullish indicators. The outcome of Ripple’s lawsuit with the SEC could cause significant volatility.


BTC’s Uptrend
The price of the primary cryptocurrency started the ongoing week at around $67,000: the same level witnessed over the weekend. However, the consolidation came to an end on May 21 when BTC pumped above $71,000.
BTC Price, Source: CoinGecko

The main catalyst for the rally appeared to be the reemerged hopes that the US SEC could approve Ethereum ETFs as early as this week.
Over the past few days, BTC’s value slightly retraced and is currently trading at approximately $69,500 (per CoinGecko’s data). The figure represents a 6% rise on a weekly scale and a 13% spike in a month.
Numerous analysts believe that Bitcoin is yet to experience a real bull run. The X user Alpha Analysis recently predicted that the asset’s price might jump to as high as $138,000 this summer, assuming history repeats itself. 




DOGE Climbs the Crypto Ladder
The leading meme coin – Dogecoin (DOGE) – has also experienced a substantial price increase lately, briefly surpassing the $0.17 mark. Its market capitalization pumped to almost $25 billion before settling at around $24 billion, thus surpassing Toncoin (TON) as the ninth-biggest cryptocurrency. 
Important metrics related to Dogecoin’s ecosystem also witnessed a significant rise. On May 21, aggregated daily volume, where each transaction exceeds $100,000, exceeded $1.5 billion. A few days later, the figure surpassed the $2 billion milestone.
As of the moment, approximately 85% of all DOGE holders sit on paper profits, with whales controlling 63% of the circulating supply.
XRP Forecasts
Ripple’s XRP is also among the digital currencies that witnessed an uptick recently, albeit in a more modest fashion than its rivals. Many analysts expect the asset to perform much better in the near future, outlining impressive predictions.
The X user JAVON MARKS claimed that a bullish breakout is in the cards due to XRP nearing “a major converging point” and “an RSI Pattern that is currently indicating underlying momentum in prices.” 
The Relative Strength Index (RSI) is a metric used in technical analysis to measure the speed and change of price movements. An RSI above 70 suggests the coin might be overbought and could be due for a correction. Data shows the ratio has predominantly hovered below the aforementioned figure during the ongoing month, currently pointing at 49.
Based on these conditions, the analyst set a wild target of $15-$20 for XRP’s value. “The signs for bullishness are there, and only time may be in the way of it being showcased,” they argued.
One essential factor that can propel severe volatility in XRP’s price is the possible outcome of the lawsuit between Ripple and the US SEC. Those willing to learn about the case’s specifics and its potential impact on the asset, feel free to check our dedicated video below:

                        Bitcoin Price PredictionBitcoin (BTC) is currently navigating resistance around $70,000. Starting the week bullish, BTC peaked at $71,957, gaining 13% over the past seven days. The rise was driven by inflows into Bitcoin spot ETFs and optimism for Ethereum spot ETF approval by the SEC.BlackRock’s IBIT Leads Bitcoin ETF Inflows and Institutional Demand
U.S. bitcoin spot ETFs have seen remarkable success, particularly BlackRock’s IBIT, which captured 94.86% of recent inflows, totalling $280 million out of $305.7 million. This fund now holds nearly 282,000 BTC, closely rivalling Grayscale’s Bitcoin Trust.
Fidelity’s FBTC also saw significant inflows.
Other bitcoin ETFs experienced no activity.
BlackRock’s IBIT is attracting 414 institutional investors, making it the fastest-growing ETF.
The success of BlackRock’s IBIT and the rising institutional interest in bitcoin ETFs indicate growing confidence in cryptocurrency, likely boosting BTC demand and positively impacting the broader crypto market.Kaleo’s Bullish Predictions for Bitcoin and Crypto Market
Analyst Kaleo predicts the true bull cycle for cryptocurrencies is yet to begin, with Bitcoin currently in an accumulation phase. He forecasts Bitcoin could reach $150,000 to $200,000, and Ethereum might surge to around $12,000.Significant capital inflows are expected to ignite a frenzy in altcoins and decentralized applications.Despite Bitcoin’s drop to around $69,000 and Ethereum at $3,737, Kaleo remains optimistic, suggesting substantial opportunities ahead.This bullish outlook is likely to drive increased investor interest and capital inflows, potentially boosting prices across the crypto market.











Bitcoin (BTC/USD) is trading at $69,563, up 0.65%, signalling a bullish Bitcoin price prediction. The 4-hour chart shows a pivot point at $68,944. Immediate resistance levels are at $72,030, $73,734, and $75,480. Key support levels are at $67,549, $65,949, and $63,901.
The RSI is at 55, indicating moderate momentum. The 50 EMA is at $67,532, supporting a slight bullish bias. Bitcoin’s trading above the $68,950 support level suggests a bullish outlook, with potential resistance around $71,000 and $72,000.
Bitcoin Price Prediction

                        The number of United States adults reporting crypto ownership or usage has seen a significant decline, according to the latest annual household survey conducted by the Fed. The survey, known as the Survey of Household Economics and Decisionmaking (SHED), indicates that approximately 18 million US adults reported using cryptocurrencies in 2023, representing a drop from previous years.In the 12-month period leading up to October 2023, the survey found that 7% of the surveyed US adults reported using cryptocurrencies, down from 10% in 2022 and 12% in 2021.Only 1% Used Crypto for Financial Transactions: Fed Survey
Among those who reported using crypto, only 1% stated that they used it for financial transactions or sending money, which is a 50% decrease from the previous year.On the other hand, 7% of respondents mentioned purchasing or holding cryptocurrencies as an investment.These findings from the Federal Reserve survey significantly differ from Coinbase’s claim that 52 million Americans own cryptocurrencies. Coinbase, a prominent cryptocurrency exchange, did not provide any response on how it arrived at this figure.The survey shed light on the reasons behind crypto usage for financial transactions.Nearly 30% of respondents who used crypto for such purposes stated that it was because the recipient preferred cryptocurrencies.Notably, a lack of trust in banks was the least cited reason.The survey also revealed that individuals with annual incomes of $100,000 or more were more likely to have used cryptocurrencies for any reason.Regarding demographics, millennials (aged 30 to 44) constituted the largest group of crypto users, closely followed by Generation Z adults (aged 18 to 29).Additionally, men were three times more likely to use cryptocurrencies compared to women.The survey highlighted that Black and Hispanic adults were more commonly engaged in crypto usage for financial transactions, while Asian adults were the largest demographic using crypto as an investment.Conversely, White adults were the least likely to use cryptocurrencies for any reason.Conducted in October 2023, the survey included 11,488 US adults aged 18 and older.Crypto’s Influence in Politics Increases
Aside from its growing adoption among retail users, cryptocurrencies are also used to influence politics.A well-funded political action committee (PAC) backed by prominent figures in the cryptocurrency industry has set its sights on key Senate races, with the goal of potentially shifting the balance of power in Congress. The PAC, called Fairshake, recently spent over $10 million successfully opposing a Democratic U.S. Senate candidate in California.As reported, approximately 73% of US voters believe that US presidential candidates should have an informed perspective on innovative technologies like artificial intelligence (AI) and cryptocurrency. Likewise, a recent report from Coinbase claimed that California voters who own cryptocurrencies are expected to have a significant impact on the 2024 elections.

Notcoin down 55% since launch - Did Toncoin suffer as a result? - AMBCrypto



Notcoin has lost over 50% of its value in just seven days.
While Toncoin has seen a decline in demand, the buyers remain in control of its market.

NOT, the token that powers Notcoin, the play-to-earn clicker gaming app on Telegram, has shed over 50% of its value in the first week of its listing. 
Exchanging hands at $0.0053 at the time of writing, the altcoin’s price has plummeted by 55% since its launch on the Toncoin [TON] network on the 16th of May. 
During this time, it airdropped nearly $1 billion worth of NOT tokens to its eligible investors.
NOT quickly gained traction, reaching an all-time high of $0.037 shortly after its launch. 
Within 24 hours of being listed on major exchanges such as Binance [BNB], the token surged to the eighth position in trading volume, exceeding $1.4 billion.
However, NOT’s daily trading volume fell after the airdrop buzz cooled. 
With a trading volume of $130 million recorded at press time, this has plummeted by 91% since the 16th of May, according to Santiment’s data. 
Source: Santiment
Toncoin stands strong
AMBCrypto previously reported that the anticipation leading up to the NOT airdrop event resulted in a surge of activity on Toncoin, boosting the value of its TON coin.
However, data from Santiment shows that the decline in NOT’s trading activity has impacted the demand for TON. 
According to the on-chain data provider, the daily count of addresses involved in TON transactions has dropped by 40% in the past seven days.
Similarly, new demand for the altcoin has decreased as well. Since the 16th of May, the number of new addresses created daily to trade TON has fallen by 53%.
Source: Santiment
However, despite the reduction in daily demand for TON, the market remained significantly under bullish influence at press time. 
AMBCrypto found that TON closed above its 20-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA) on the 23rd of May and traded above it at $6.49 as of this writing. 
When an asset rallies above its 20-day EMA, it is considered a bullish signal. This means that the asset’s current price has surged past its average price in the past 20 days. 
TON holders often interpret this as a shift toward coin accumulation. 

Read Toncoin’s [TON] Price Prediction 2024-25

Confirming the bullish trend, TON’s Elder-Ray Index returned a positive value of 0.26 at press time. This indicator measures the relationship between the strength of ETH’s buyers and sellers in the market.

When its value is positive like this, bull power dominates the market.

Bloomberg analyst predicts Solana ETF delay despite community anticipation

James Seyffart, a Bloomberg ETF analyst, has suggested a potential timeline for the launch of a Solana-based spot exchange-traded fund (ETF).Seyffart indicated that a Solana ETF might be delayed despite growing anticipation within the crypto community following recent discussions surrounding spot Ethereum ETFs.CFTC-regulated futures marketThe Bloomberg ETF expert explained that the timeline for a Solana ETF could extend over several years, influenced by the regulatory environment in the United States. He said:“Based on current precedent/needs, [it] will happen within a few years of getting a CFTC-regulated futures market. But Congress [and] market structure bills like FIT21 could make it happen quicker.”He also highlighted that the Solana ETF might face delays due to its classification as a security by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Unlike Ethereum, the SEC has explicitly labeled Solana as a security in its lawsuits against Coinbase and Kraken. Seyffart added:“But SEC isn’t dancing around SOL’s status like they have ETH. Those lawsuits against COIN and Kraken and others flat out say ‘Solana is a security.'”Despite these challenges, Seyffart believes a Solana-based ETF would likely attract more demand than other altcoins ETFs.Experts debate Solana ETFSeyffart’s comments come amid increasing community calls for a Solana ETF.On a recent CNBC show, Brian Kelly, CEO of digital currency investment firm BKCM, suggested that Solana could be the next crypto-based spot ETF to debut in the US.Additionally, Kelly noted that the SEC’s approval of spot Ethereum ETFs could clarify the market, potentially paving the way for the launch of other crypto-based ETFs.However, Nate Geraci, president of The ETF Store, believes a spot Solana ETF won’t materialize until a Solana futures product is traded on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange or US lawmakers establish clear crypto regulations. He added:“Crypto ETF spigot turned off for a while after spot Ethereum ETF approval.”Mentioned in this articleLatest Alpha Market Report

Nancy Pelosi Votes For Landmark Crypto Bill, Defies Longtime Adviser And Current SEC Commissioner Who Gave Thumbs Down For Bitcoin ETF - Benzinga

Former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.), who voted in favor of the bill laying down clear regulations for the cryptocurrency industry, went against the stand of her former financial adviser and incumbent SEC Commissioner Jaime Lizárraga.What Happened: In a massive win for the digital asset market in the U.S., the House of Representatives passed landmark legislation establishing a regulatory framework for the industry. The bill led by Republicans received bipartisan support, with as many as 71 Democrats voting in favor, including Pelosi.Following the passage of the Financial Innovation and Technology for the 21st Century Act, also known as FIT21, Pelosi said in a statement, "The digital asset industry needs clearer rules of the road and the federal government needs stronger enforcement authority in order to ensure the responsible development of this emerging technology.""Millions of Americans own cryptocurrency.  American companies are the cutting edge of global financial technology.  Many jobs in my Bay Area community are dependent on this industry," the influential Democrat emphasized.Interestingly, Pelosi's stance contradicted that of Lizárraga, who served as her senior financial adviser for 10 years. Why It Matters: Lizárraga has backed SEC Chair Gary Gensler‘s position that most digital asset tokens are securities and serve as unregistered market participants.He was also one of two SEC commissioners who voted against the approving spot Bitcoin BTC/USD ETFs earlier this year.Lizárraga criticized the crypto industry after the FTX collapse, saying it has worsened the financial market's underlying weaknesses. However, Pelosi’s vote for friendlier cryptocurrency legislation and strong support for the industry’s interests reflected a diverging stance.This also signaled an evolving perspective on the investment class in the country. With a growing crypto demographic–the highest in absolute numbers and the third-highest by population share–lawmakers may be inclined to take a more accommodating approach toward digital assets.Read Next: Research Firm Boosts Ethereum Spot ETF Approval Probability To 90%: But Will It Be A ‘Sell The News’ Event?Photo via Shutterstock

SIX Digital Exchange (SDX) surpasses one billion USD in assets - Crypto Valley Journal

The SIX Digital Exchange (SDX) announced that the issuance of digital assets on its platform surpassed the CHF 1 billion mark. This primarily involves the tokenization of traditional bonds on the blockchain.Since September 2021, the Swiss stock exchange SIX is operating a fully regulated platform for the issuance and trading of digital assets. SDX members include leading Swiss banking institutions such as UBS, ZKB, Raiffeisen Switzerland, several cantonal banks and others. In addition, international institutions are running their digital asset trials on the platform.
One Billion CHF thanks to World Bank bondThe participation of key issuers such as the World Bank, UBS AG, the City of Lugano, the Cantons of Zurich and Basel-Stadt, the City of St. Gallen and SIX Group AG has significantly advanced the digital transformation of the Swiss financial market, according to a press release. In particular, several issues were part of the SNB's Helvetia Phase III project, which enables settlement in Swiss francs (CHF) as a digital central bank currency (wCBDC). Switzerland is the only major financial center in the world to have enabled settlement of securities transactions in wCBDC. Interested readers can learn more about this topic in an interview with Thomas Moser, an alternate member of the SNB Board.SDX achieved this milestone in collaboration with the World Bank. The World Bank priced the first digital CHF bond from an international issuer to be settled in Swiss francs using the digital central bank currency (wCBDC) provided by the Swiss National Bank (SNB). With a maturity of seven years and a volume of CHF 200 million, this was the largest Swiss franc bond issued by the World Bank since 2009. SDX processes the coupon and redemption payments in tokenized CHF.
Further expansionThe success of the digital bond issuance strengthens SIX's position as a pioneer in digital assets. With a focus on regulatory compliance, security and efficiency, SDX continues to set new standards in digital finance, revolutionizing the way investors access and interact with financial markets."Surpassing the one billion mark underscores the growing acceptance and proliferation of digital assets in the global financial landscape and the leading position of the Swiss financial center in this critical area of capital market innovation. [...] The digital bonds issued to date remain accessible to the entire investor community as they are listed, traded and settled on both a regulated digital exchange and traditional market infrastructures." - David Newns, Head of SIX Digital Exchange

Analyst Says Blue-Chip Ethereum Rival Could Explode by up to 237%, Updates Outlook on Pepe, Floki and Chainlink - The Daily Hodl


								A closely followed crypto strategist believes that a top Ethereum (ETH) rival could go on an explosive rally of more than 230%.
Pseudonymous analyst Inmortal tells his 213,800 followers on the social media platform X that Solana (SOL) could reach a new all-time high (ATH) by the end of the summer.










“1. New ATH by end of summer. 2. Cycle top around $400-$600.”
Source: Inmortal/X
Looking at his chart, the analyst suggests Solana’s price will consolidate before breaking through the diagonal resistance toward new ATHs. Solana reached its ATH of about $260 in November 2021.
Solana is trading for $178 at time of writing, down slightly in the last 24 hours.
Next up, the analyst says that Ethereum’s rally to kick off the week will likely propel memecoins Pepe (PEPE) and Floki (FLOKI) higher.
“ETH moving gives the altcoins a free hand to move as well. PEPE is following well and it is very likely that FLOKI will move soon too. You know, contagion, muscle memory.”
Source: Inmortal/X
Looking at his chart, the analyst suggests Floki could break out to $0.000340, a more than 52% gain from the current value.
Floki is trading for $0.000223 at time of writing up nearly 2% in the last 24 hours.
Lastly, the analyst believes that decentralized oracle network Chainlink (LINK) is heading to $28 if it can hold $16 as support on the three-day chart.
“Marines ready to send it if we find acceptance above $16.”

LINK is trading for $16.35 at time of writing, down 2% in the last 24 hours.

BREAKING! SEC Begins Negotiations with Companies Applying for Ethereum ETFs! - Bitcoin Sistemi


The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has begun discussions with prospective issuers of Ethereum exchange-traded funds (ETFs) regarding their S-1 registration statements, according to a senior official at an issuing firm.
SEC Working on S-1 Forms with Ethereum ETF Issuers
“Basically, it's just getting started,” the official said, noting that the SEC's Investment Management Division seemed a bit surprised by the shift in focus on Ethereum ETFs.


Despite the initial nature of these discussions, the source expressed cautious optimism about progress towards the Ethereum ETF, emphasizing that they do not expect the process to be halted.
For Ethereum ETFs to be approved, the SEC must first approve 19b-4 forms, which outline proposed changes to exchange rules required for trading ETFs.





This was done in a unified scheme for Bitcoin ETFs. Following this, S-1 registration statements providing detailed information about the ETF must go into effect before trading can begin.

Issuers typically go through a cycle of submitting, amending, and re-filing these forms before the final versions are approved by the SEC.


Today is the last day for the SEC to make a decision regarding Ethereum ETFs. An approval is expected today. As developments occur, we will share them with you at the last minute.

Enormous 5.7 Trillion Shiba Inu (SHIB) in 24 Hours: What's Happening?

According to Shiba Inu's on-chain data, large transactions recorded have increased to 341 in the last 24 hours from 82 transactions at the week's low, implying a large increase in investors. The total volume of these large transactions amounts to 5.7 trillion SHIB, having reached the seven-day high of 8.97 trillion SHIB on May 16, 2024.There are a few reasons that this increased activity in big transactions may be taking place. Expectations over some major price action might have caused whales to reposition. Other than that, it could be strategic portfolio adjustments, new partnerships or ecosystem developments within the Shiba Inu project that have not been announced yet.SHIB/USDT Chart by TradingViewAccording to the SHIB price chart, Shiba Inu is trading within an uptrend channel pattern, with the current price level at about $0.00002550. The 50-day exponential moving average is supporting the price, and the 200-day exponential moving average is closing in below the current price, indicating a generally medium- to long-term bullish trend.The Bollinger Bands are slightly expanding, indicating that volatility is starting to pick up and could very soon bring more substantial price moves. The Relative Strength Index stands at 54.79, showing that SHIB has not been oversold or overbought, hence, there could be a potential upward move.One way or another, the most likely reason behind the surge is lying beneath the upcoming surge of large transfers. Whales have the means to access pieces of information and resources that normal traders do not have, thus positioning themselves in anticipation of changes on the market. By doing so, the rise in activity on SHIB can be taken as an indication of their confidence about potential future gains from putting money into Shiba Inu.

It has amassed over 5.6 million users and partnerships with brands like Adidas, Steve Aoki, and Asics. Stepn was first built on Solana, but has expanded to Ethereum and BNB Chain as well.Promotional artwork shows an image from Stepn Go.

Former nChain CEO jailed for 10 months over Craig Wright leaks


Reports that the former CEO of nChain, Christen Ager-Hanssen, was sentenced to 10 months for the leaking of documents exposing Craig Wright have been confirmed. 
According to What The Finance (WTF), a judgment hearing took place on May 3 in the High Court as part of nChain Holding AG’s case against Ager-Hanssen.  
During the hearing, the judge established that Ager-Hanssen had broken multiple court orders requiring him to remove leaked documents from the public domain, reveal who received his documents, and give up various devices.   
The leaked document was reportedly the Fairway Brief, a collection of confidential information relating to Craig Wright’s false claims to be Satoshi. The document also alleged Calvin Ayre, Marco Bianchi, and the Fairway Family Office AG conducted a ‘criminal conspiracy’ that would allow Ayre to take over nChain’s IP for a cheaper rate.   
nChain reportedly acquired court orders to remove the information from the public domain before filing for contempt of court. The judge concluded that Ager-Hanssen deliberately breached these orders and he was found in contempt of court. The court reportedly viewed his non-compliance as an attempt to undermine court authority and nChain’s requests to keep its information confidential​​.

As a result, he was handed immediate custodial sentences of 10 months and four months, to be served concurrently, for breaching the various orders. He is reportedly due to be released in five months. His hearing was initially reported by WTF who confirmed the news today.  
Ager-Hanssen is reportedly going to appeal his conviction. Whistleblowers UK, which will reportedly support Ager-Hanssen in an appeal, told WTF, “This case like many others, demonstrates that UK whistleblowing laws are out of step with justice and do not do what they are supposed to do, which is to protect whistleblowers against criminals.”

Gay Elon Musk (GAYELON) to Skyrocket 13,000% as KuCoin Listing Announced, While Shiba Inu and Dogecoin Struggle



                    

Gay Elon Musk (GAYELON) could turn early investors into multi-millionaires if it becomes a mainstream coin, like Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE).



Gay Elon Musk (GAYELON), a new Solana memecoin that was launched this week, is poised to explode over 14,000% in price in the coming days.




This is because GAYELON has announced its first centralized exchange listing, which will be on KuCoin.



This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up.



Currently, Gay Elon Musk can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jupiter and Raydium, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days.



Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Gay Elon Musk could become the next viral memecoin.



Gay Elon Musk launched with over $6,000 of locked liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains.



To buy Gay Elon Musk on Raydium or Jupiter ahead of the KuCoin listing, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Gay Elon Musk by entering its contract address – AErKQkbiSgsRMT1GmS7XW5tWkpSmdT1zdVJCMv1unvBH – in the receiving field.



In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price.




If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner.



The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum.




This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like GAYELON.

Mysterious 240 Million XRP Transfer: Where Did It Go?




Cover image via www.freepik.com

In a striking development within the cryptocurrency market, an unusual transfer of 240 million XRP tokens was executed from the Coincheck exchange to an unknown wallet. This significant movement has sparked interest and speculation in the crypto community.Crypto data tracker Whale Alert reports, "240,850,537 XRP worth $127,054,365 was transferred from Coincheck to unknown wallet." This recent withdrawal of the massive amount of XRP tokens, valued at approximately $127 million, was directed to an unknown address, which was activated in February. The destination wallet "UQ2Eh" continuously receives XRP transfers from Coincheck, indicating a solid relationship with the exchange. The reasons behind this transfer and the identity of the wallet owner remain unknown, adding to the mystery surrounding the transaction.While the exact motives remain speculative, several potential reasons for the transfer have emerged: the transfer may have been made on behalf of an institutional investor. Institutions frequently transfer substantial amounts of cryptocurrency to cold storage wallets for security reasons or to represent a long-term holding strategy.Additionally, Coincheck may be transferring assets as part of enhanced security measures. After a major security incident in 2018, Coincheck has prioritized security, and moving funds to more secure storage solutions may be part of sustained efforts to safeguard assets.Third, the large transfer might be linked to an OTC trade, where substantial amounts of cryptocurrency are exchanged directly between parties. Whether this move signals institutional interest, enhanced security measures, or upcoming strategic announcements, might suggest interest in XRP and the broader cryptocurrency market. At the time of writing, XRP was down 0.60% in the last 24 hours to $0.529.

Ethereum ETF Approval Is Likely Say Sources Close to SEC: Report - Decrypt

We do the research, you get the alpha!Get exclusive reports and access to key insights on airdrops, NFTs, and more! Subscribe now to Alpha Reports and up your game!Go to Alpha ReportsIt's Ethereum ETF deadline day for the Securities and Exchange Commission. Now sources close to the SEC are saying the regulator has shown signs of warming to the idea of allowing spot Ethereum ETFs to trade.Unnamed sources told Fox Business that the commission has been taking cues from recent court rulings and its past decision to allow ETH futures ETFs to trade as it considers whether to grant permission for nine funds to begin trading.Most pressing for the SEC is making a decision on the filings from Cboe exchange to list the VanEck Ethereum ETF and the Ark 21Shares Ethereum ETF.But that's not all. Counting VanEck and Ark Invest with 21Shares, there are nine total applicants. The rest include BlackRock, Fidelity, Grayscale—which wants to convert its Grayscale Ethereum Trust (ETHE) the way it did its Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC)—Hashdex, Franklin Templeton, Invesco with Galaxy Digital, and Bitwise.At the time of writing, the Ethereum price is north of $3,800—that's 2% higher than it was this time yesterday.Trading volume swelled to $45 billion in the past 24 hours as hype for a potential Ethereum ETF has surged. For reference, that's just $4 billion shy of the amount of Bitcoin that changed hands in the past day, according to Coinglass.What's more, Ethereum open interest has grown by another 4% to $16 billion. That's also come with some bad news for Ethereum derivatives traders. In the past day $43 million worth of Ethereum futures positions have been liquidated, which is nearly double the value of Bitcoin futures positions liquidated in the past 24 hours, according to Coinglass.Meanwhile, Gensler faced tough questions in a letter from the House Financial Services Committee yesterday.Republican lawmakers, including HFSC Chairman Patrick McHenry (R-SC), were curious about the regulator having recently given digital asset firm Prometheum the green light to begin offering an Ethereum custody service.The fact that Prometheum is an SEC-regulated firm and got permission from the commission to offer the service seems to imply that the commission is treating ETH like a security—even though it has countless times refused to share its position on the matter.As a footnote: An unredacted version of the Consensys lawsuit against the SEC over its treatment of Ethereum says that an internal memo circulated last year instructed commission staff to treat ETH like a security.Daily Debrief NewsletterStart every day with the top news stories right now, plus original features, a podcast, videos and more.

Crypto expert Michaël van de Poppe predicts 'big bull cycle' for these assets


    Amid significant developments in different markets and across industries, hard assets like gold, silver, and cryptocurrencies seem to be teetering at the edge of a massive bull cycle, at least according to one crypto trading expert, who has referred to them as must-haves in portfolios.



As it happens, renowned crypto analyst Michaël van de Poppe has observed the “extremely low (…) valuations of Crypto & Gold, Silver compared to the Dollar & Equities,” adding that “we’re on the edge of a big bull cycle in hard assets overall, commodities included,” in his X post on May 22.



In other words, he suggested that investors should accumulate in their portfolios exactly these “hard assets” – crypto, gold, and silver – today, while they are still cheap in comparison to the United States dollar and stocks, as the “big bull cycle” could start at any moment, judging by the chart patterns.







Gold vs. Dow Jones Industrial Average analysis. Source: Michaël van de Poppe







Indeed, gold is currently trading at the price of $2,364.39 per ounce or $76,016.82 per kilogram, recording a decline of 0.75% on the day, dropping 0.83% across the week but still recording an increase of 2.85% on its monthly chart, according to the latest data retrieved on May 23.

At the same time, the price of silver at press time stood at $30.52 per ounce or $981.36 per kilogram, which suggests a 1.29% drop in the last 24 hours but nonetheless an increase of 4% over the previous seven days and an accumulated advance of 13.72% across the past month.

Cryptocurrencies price analysis



Meanwhile, in terms of digital assets, van de Poppe has earlier observed that the crypto market representative, Bitcoin (BTC), was “slowly consolidating,” adding that he was “expecting a retest at the $68K mark, before a continuation upwards,” and reiterating that the “trend is clearly upwards.”

Specifically, Bitcoin is presently changing hands at the price of $69,730, which represents a modest loss of 0.49% on its daily chart, while the flagship decentralized finance (DeFi) asset clings to the 5.07% gain across the past week and a growth of 5.52% in the last month.

It is also worth noting that van de Poppe has earlier highlighted that altcoins like Ethereum (ETH) were still heavily undervalued, with most of them being “down 70% against Bitcoin,” sharing his expectations that altcoins would “do way better (…) in the coming months,” as per his X post on May 21.

Institutional Bitcoin FOMO? ETFs Hit 850K BTC, BlackRock Closes In


							

US Bitcoin ETFs amass over 850,000 Bitcoins, signaling growing institutional interest



BlackRock’s Bitcoin ETF nears the top spot, challenging Grayscale’s dominance



Bitcoin market cools down, hinting at potential for a major price movement




According to the latest updates from venture capital firm HODL15Capital, U.S. Bitcoin ETFs have achieved a historic milestone, accumulating over 850,000 Bitcoins since January 2024. The report also notes that the global ETF market has surpassed 1 billion Bitcoins.







The US Bitcoin market has seen eight consecutive days of positive net inflows, with a net inflow of $154 million on May 22, 2024. BlackRock’s IBIT led the pack with an inflow of $92 million that day, followed by Fidelity’s FBTC with an inflow of $74.6 million. However, Grayscale Investment’s GBTC experienced a notable outflow of $16.1 million after five consecutive days of positive flows.



Notably, BlackRock’s substantial inflow of $92 million on the eighth day of continuous positive flows could potentially propel IBIT to become the largest Bitcoin ETF, surpassing GBTC. Currently, BlackRock’s IBIT holds 281,883.91970 Bitcoins, closely trailing GBTC, which holds 289,500.0395 Bitcoins.



A recent analysis by Glassnode revealed that the Bitcoin market has entered a cooling period “after several months of intense distribution pressure.” The report suggests a significant market shift characterized by decreased selling activity and a decline in volatility.



In an X post, Glassnode stated, “Whilst capital inflows remain modest, the lightening of sell-side, and compression of volatility suggest a bigger move could be on the horizon.”







Over the past few days, Bitcoin has been hovering around the $70,000 mark, with investors eagerly watching for the cryptocurrency to reach its all-time high of $73,700. As of press time, BTC was trading at $69,469, marking a slight decline of 0.43% in one day. However, the cryptocurrency has seen notable surges of 5% and 4% in one week and one month, respectively.

$800 billion Standard Chartered predicts Bitcoin to hit $150k this year


    With Bitcoin (BTC) surging past $69,000, questions about new all-time highs and its potential price in 2024 are becoming increasingly prominent. Many experts have weighed in, but the most influential opinions come from financial institutions and their analysts.



Recently, Standard Chartered made one of the most bullish predictions. Analysts from this leading international cross-border bank predicted that Bitcoin could reach new all-time highs above $73,700. 



This projection, which is slightly higher than the cryptocurrency’s previous peak, comes with an ambitious and unexpected timeline.







Bitcoin’s new all-time high already in a couple of days



Geoff Kendrick, Head of EM FX Research, West, and Crypto Research at Standard Chartered, has made a bullish prediction for Bitcoin, the maiden cryptocurrency. 



Kendrick stated that BTC is poised to surpass its previous all-time high reached on March 14, 2024, potentially reaching approximately $73,798. He expects this significant surge to occur by the weekend, attributing the potential increase to recent inflows into Spot Bitcoin ETFs.



On May 21, data from Farside Investors indicated that Spot Bitcoin ETFs had their best inflow week in the last two months, with US funds collectively seeing $948 million in positive net flows from May 13 to May 17. 



Since their launch on January 11, Spot Bitcoin ETFs have recorded inflows exceeding $13 billion. This increased demand and influx of capital contributed to Bitcoin’s previous rise to a new all-time high in March and could drive further surges in the cryptocurrency’s value.



Bitcoin over $150,000 by the end of 2024 thanks to Ethereum



Kendrick has also revealed that the potential approval of Ethereum (ETH) Spot ETFs by the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) could significantly impact Bitcoin’s price dynamics. 



He has reiterated his earlier prediction that Bitcoin could rise to $150,000 by the end of 2024 and reach an impressive $200,000 in 2025.

Hours Before the Potential Approval of the Ethereum ETF, Discussion Started to Which Project the Next ETFs Will Be? Here are the Details! - Bitcoin Sistemi


BKCM CEO Brian Kelly made headlines when he suggested on CNBC that Solana (SOL) could be the next cryptocurrency with an exchange-traded fund (ETF).
Speculation Grows on Potential Solana ETF Amid Market Uncertainty
The announcement reignited debate in the financial community, particularly after similar speculation emerged in Hong Kong earlier this year that an issuer might be preparing a SOL ETF.


But Kelly acknowledged some hurdles that could hinder the launch of a Solana ETF. Unlike Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH), Solana does not currently have a futures ETF, a factor that simplifies the process for regulators and issuers.
In addition, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) classified Solana as a security, further complicating its path to becoming an ETF.






Despite these challenges, the potential for a Solana ETF continues to generate buzz. Known for its high transaction speeds and low costs, Solana has gained significant traction within the crypto community.
An ETF will likely appeal to a broader audience of investors by increasing its legitimacy and accessibility.


The crypto market is keenly watching developments on this front, as the successful launch of a Solana ETF could signal a new phase of growth and adoption for alternative cryptocurrencies beyond Bitcoin and Ethereum.
However, given the regulatory environment and expressed reservations from major issuers, the realization of a Solana ETF remains uncertain.

                        The UK government’s Charity Commission probe has concluded that Effective Ventures Foundation, an FTX-funded charity, acted “diligently and quickly” to protect charity funds in the wake of FTX’s massive collapse.“The inquiry found that the trustees took appropriate steps to protect the charity’s funds and complied with their legal duties acting diligently and quickly following the collapse of FTX,” a press statement read.Per the investigation, the charity fund received £3.3 million ($300,000) in donations, which the trustees “ringfenced,” requesting and obtaining a Defence against Money Laundering from the National Crime Agency.Further, the charity also decided to reach a settlement agreement for the repayment of funds received from FTX in 2022. “The charity made this decision following independent legal advice they had received,” the report added.During the investigation, two trustees with connections to FTX resigned from their positions at the charity.However, following the collapse of the FTX exchange, trustees not connected to FTX, “acted quickly to assess the risk to the charity and installed measures to protect charitable assets and continued operations.”Effective Ventures Agreed to Repay Millions
The Charity Commission in England and Wales announced in Jan 2023 that it initiated investigations on Effective Ventures (EV), owing to the fact that FTX is a “major sponsor.”Effective Ventures reportedly disclosed its links to FTX as a “severe event,” which may possibly harm other assets. This eventually triggered the regulator to probe the trustees of the charity.Per reports, the UK charity under investigation told Civil Society early this year that it paid $4.3m (around £3.4m) to the FTX estate.“This amount is equal to the entire amount which EV UK received from FTX and the FTX Foundation during 2022,” a spokesperson for the charity noted.The FTX Foundation, which shut down in November 2022 after FTX exchange collapsed, was one of EV UK’s largest founders.However, in a recent statement, Zachary Robinson, interim CEO of EV US, said that both EV UK and EV US had collectively paid $26.8m to FTX estate. This is 100% of the funds that EV received from FTX, he added.“This means that EV’s projects can continue to fundraise with confidence that donations won’t be used to cover the cost of this settlement. We strongly condemn fraud and the actions underlying Sam Bankman-Fried’s conviction.”

Best AI Crypto Coins in 2024: Top 8 Projects to Watch


																Cryptocurrencies that have integrated artificial intelligence (AI) or plan to do so have been soaring in popularity.
The fast-paced expansion and development of AI have generated considerable interest, controversy, and fear among the public, especially tech enthusiasts, investors, and even government officials and politicians. Projects like OpenAI’s ChatGPT, as well as its numerous alternatives, have been making headlines left and right, and this has inevitably impacted the crypto industry.
This can be reminiscent of Bitcoin and the early creation of the decentralized finance (DeFi) market.
But as with the broader cryptocurrency market, AI-focused projects have also increased in their numbers and identifying the legitimate and promising ones can be a bit challenging.
That’s why, in this guide, we take a closer look at the top AI-based crypto protocols that you should have on your watch list.

Quick Navigation

What is AI Crypto?
Before proceeding, let’s briefly explain AI crypto and why this sector has blossomed in the last few years.
At the forefront of crypto, AI crypto projects appreciated substantially, especially in the first quarter of 2024. The reason is not just hype; the combination of AI and blockchain technology has opened several windows of new use cases and applications for finance, data storage, cloud computing, and much more.
In decentralized finance (DeFi), for example, we can see different types of dApps using AI. Decentralized exchanges (DEXs) can use AI to facilitate trade automation through algorithms (as many automated market makers do).
AI can also improve the screening process for smart contracts, allowing founders to spot potential threats and vulnerabilities. In another example, AI is frequently used to produce generative art NFT projects, such as Interactive Non-Fungible Tokens (iNFTs), which incorporate intelligent traits and reasoning abilities.
There are currently hundreds of AI-based crypto projects, each targeting a specific market within and outside the space.
Best AI Crypto Projects to Watch This Year
Fetch.ai (FET)
Fetch.ai is one of the top crypto AI projects boasting billions in total market capitalization.

It allows users to leverage resources and tools to build and monetize their AI-powered crypto apps and services. However, one feature that distinguishes Fetch is autonomous economic agents.
These agents, which can be devices, services, organizations, or individuals, are capable of performing various tasks such as processing and sharing data among IoT (Internet of Things) devices, executing crypto transactions for users, and facilitating trades and swaps on decentralized exchanges like Uniswap through crypto trading bots.
The protocol operates on its own blockchain, powered by its utility token, FET. A unique aspect of its blockchain is its mixed consensus: Proof-of-Work (PoW) and Proof-of-Stake (PoS), in which miners validate transaction blocks and agents earn fees for executing multiple AI-related tasks.
For developers, Fetch offers a comprehensive suite of tools, including AI, Web3, and blockchain infrastructure, resources, and extensive documentation to create decentralized AI projects.
Likewise, Fetch also features the Open Economic Framework (OEF), an AI-driven layer that stores information for agents. This layer allows agents to interact and source information while nodes (miners) are rewarded with FET for facilitating these interactions.
Render Network (RNDR)
Render Network is an Ethereum-based blockchain platform that aims to decentralize GPU cloud rendering by connecting those who need rendering services with owners of high-performance GPUs.
It is one of the top Solana projects.

This system enables artists, individuals, and companies to carry out rendering tasks more affordably and quickly than traditional centralized options.
The platform operates as follows: creators submit rendering jobs, and node operators use their spare GPU capacity to complete these jobs and earn RNDR tokens as compensation. Render Network supports a range of tasks, from basic rendering for gaming and entertainment to complex projects involving AI and machine learning.
The protocol also implements a tiered pricing system based on the reputation of node operators. The highest-rated operators fall into tier 1 and are typically the most expensive but offer more reliable and scalable services, often used by Render’s partners.
Tier 2 provides high-quality services at a reduced cost, and Tier 3 offers the most economical options, but reliability and scalability are not the highest-rated. This pricing structure supports the democratization of GPU cloud computing, particularly for Web3 creators, by adapting to various budget needs.
The Graph (GRT)
The Graph is a decentralized, open-source indexing protocol that collects, processes, and stores information and data similarly to a web browser like Google.

It allows users to navigate and explore different blockchain ecosystems and their respective dApps. The Graph is also available in at least 14 languages.
One of the key features of The Graph is Subgraphs, which are indices designed to enhance data querying for users across several networks, including EVM-compatible blockchains and even the InterPlanetary File System (IPFS).
Subgraphs can index all public information globally, bridging the gap between Web2 and Web3. This data can be stored, organized, and shared across applications, making it accessible for anyone to query. Naturally, users pay using the protocol’s native coin, GRT.
GRT has one of the largest supplies in the AI sector, with a max supply of 10,799,004,319 tokens and approximately 9.5 billion tokens in circulation.
BitTensor (TAO)
BitTensor is an open-source infrastructure built around a blockchain called Subtensor. It utilizes a unique consensus mechanism called Proof-of-Intelligence (PoI).

This mechanism resembles Proof-of-Work (PoW) by rewarding miners for their valuable contributions across various technology and research domains within the BitTensor network.
BitTensor functions as a decentralized marketplace with multiple subnets, each designed for specific tasks. Unlike parallel chains in systems like Avalanche, these subnets are competitive marketplaces tailored for AI, machine learning, data storage, price feeds, cellular automation, and more.
A notable example of a subnet in BitTensor is Decentralized AI Detection, where miners are incentivized to share findings, solutions, products, tools, and frameworks to help the network detect content generated by large language models (LLMs) like ChatGPT.
Anyone can create a subnet by paying a registration fee in TAO, BitTensor’s native token, and establish incentive mechanisms for miners and validators. Each subnet has validators who assess the quality of miners’ work and reward them with TAO.
BitTensor aims to democratize and commoditize AI and emerging technologies through blockchain technology.
Akash Network (AKT)
Akash Network is one of the top AI crypto coins that introduces a cloud-computing marketplace where users can buy and sell cloud resources using AKT as the payment method.

Akash Network rose to prominence as one of the largest AI crypto coins thanks to its simple business model: users needing cloud computing can purchase resources from those with extra capacity, all in a peer-to-peer manner.
The platform’s main competitive edge is its ability to provide decentralized storage and asset ownership at a lower cost than traditional centralized systems, appealing to both businesses and individuals.
Akash has formed partnerships with leading institutions in the crypto space, such as Coinbase Prime, which offers custodial services for AKT, and Solve.Care, a blockchain-based healthcare platform aimed at decentralizing patient data and integrating blockchain benefits into healthcare systems.
Akash utilizes the Interplanetary File System (IPFS) for decentralized storage due to its enhanced security and resistance to censorship.
The rise in popularity of DeCloud (decentralized cloud), AI, and ML protocols has driven increased usage and renewed investor interest in Akash and similar AI coins.
AIOZ Network (AIOZ)
AIOZ Network, created by the tech company AIOZ, is a blockchain-based platform that aims to deliver scalable and reliable solutions in Web3 storage, AI computing, live streaming, and video on demand.
The company, founded by Erman Tjiputra, focuses on making AI development more democratic and decentralized through its two main offerings: the W3AI marketplace for AI computation and the Web3 AI Platform, which provides a variety of AI solutions for businesses, developers, and individuals.

AIOZ operates on the Cosmos network and is compatible with BEP and EVM, using a Delegated Proof-of-Stake (DPoS) consensus mechanism powered by Tendermint Core that allows for up to 1,500 transactions per second. Its Decentralized Content Delivery Network (dCDN) utilizes a global network of nodes to provide additional computing power.
The network offers a decentralized marketplace for the Decentralized Physical Infrastructure (DePIN) market, enabling contributors to monetize their AI-related assets and computing resources.
This setup offers competitive costs for cloud computing and allows for the deployment of AI applications, benefiting businesses and developers by providing cheaper alternatives to traditional infrastructures.
SingularityNET (AGIX)
SingularityNET is a marketplace for AI products and services. It allows users to create their AI-powered models through the protocol’s blockchain, which offers smart contract templates for faster and easier development and deployment.
The platform allows developers to build AI models and systems or purchase existing ones to integrate into their projects, creating a decentralized AI ecosystem that benefits both projects and developers. These and other transactions on the platform are carried out using the protocol’s native token, AGIX.

SingularityNET is one of the AI crypto projects due to its extensive offerings, featuring over 70 AI-powered services. These include:

Domain-Specific Language (DSL): a self-organizing network of AI agents that can delegate tasks to each other.
OpenCog Hyperon: an open-source general AI system based on OpenCog, a framework for developing AI models, robotics, and virtual embodied cognition.
Training AI models: users can train and customize AI models for various services based on specific needs.
Other services include speech command recognition, neural image generation, multilingual speech translators, real-time voice cloning, and more.

Ocean Protocol (OCEAN)
Through AI-powered smart contracts, Ocean Protocol allows data suppliers to sell specific data directly to consumers. This data can be from multiple industries, including healthcare, politics, finance, e-commerce, and more.
Ocean Protocol is one of the OGs in AI-crypto. It was founded in 2017 by Bruce Pon, an entrepreneur who established BigchainDB, a blockchain database software company, and AI researcher Trent McConaghy, who holds a PhD in Creative AI.

Ocean Protocol offers other appealing features. One is the Ocean Predictoor, which allows users to run AI-powered prediction or trading bots on crypto price feeds to generate yields.
It supports Javascript and Python and provides builders with a library of resources and tools to build AI decentralized applications and APIs to monetize them. Developers can leverage many features, such as IP ownership, access licenses, payment routing, analytics for on-chain data, and more.
How to Buy AI Crypto?
There are two main ways to buy AI crypto tokens. The first is through centralized exchanges like Binance.
As a partner of Binance, CryptoPotato readers can receive exclusively a $600 voucher. Use this link to head to Binance. Open a new account, verify it, and then complete the following tasks for up to $600 free.

That said, once you have an account registered, you will need to navigate to the top of your main menu and in the right corner, click on the “depoist” button and select “buy crypto.”

From there, you will simply need to input your preferred currency and the cryptocurrency you want to buy. You can use a regular credit or debit card for this.
Alternative, you can also use a decentralized exchange (DEX), but that’s a more complicated process and would require more technical knowledge.
Is AI Good for Crypto?
AI and blockchain technology can synergize if both are used for their best purposes. As we’ve seen with the projects listed above, AI can be used for trading automation in a blockchain-based protocol, enhancing trading functions and price automation.
For crypto institutions, AI algorithms, through machine learning, are helping exchanges provide and fulfill trading orders quicker, develop chatbots that assist users, smart trading bots that can analyze market trends and predict price movements, and more.
Regarding security and on-chain analysis, blockchain firms can use AI to spot potential threats and vulnerabilities in a smart contract. Moreover, wallets and exchanges can use AI to detect suspicious activity or flag addresses that have been poisoned or belong to a malicious actor.
Even in mining, we see AI and crypto merging, as AI marketplaces can provide or optimize computing power allocation for users.
There are certain drawbacks, however, and we can summarise them as follows:

Centralization: There’s a growing concern in the public that leading AI companies are working on their AI models behind closed doors, leaving investors and users out of the picture and raising concerns over the lack of transparency and power centralization. Projects like BitTensor try to democratize AI developments and innovation by rewarding users for sharing their discoveries and models.


Black Box Problem: AI algorithms can be opaque, making it difficult to understand their decision-making processes. The black box problem refers to the challenge of transparency and interpretability of AI algorithms during their time of existence and may complicate/strain operations in crypto projects.


New risk and security challenges: introducing AI in crypto could mean new risks and vulnerabilities that malicious actors can exploit.

Best AI Crypto Projects – Conclusion
There are multiple ways in which AI and crypto can work, from fraud detection, smart contract security, and on-chain analysis to cloud-based resources, mining, and trading optimization.
The marriage between AI and crypto has opened new windows of use cases and applications for multiple industries. However, their drawbacks must be addressed and analyzed thoroughly to mitigate their negative impact on users and investors.

                        SOL has fallen by 4% in the past 24 hours, with the Solana price dropping to $173.63 on a day when the cryptocurrency market has barely moved.Despite this loss, Solana remains up by a healthy 7% in a week, with the popular altcoin also sitting on a 22% gain in a fortnight, and a hefty 775% increase in a year.With the coin’s medium- and long-term momentum remaining strong, today’s dip represents a good opportunity to buy it at a discount, before it rises again.Solana Price Prediction 23 May: SOL is Up 7% in a Week – Time to Buy?
SOL may have taken a hit today, yet its chart is in a sweet sport insofar as it points to an incoming rebound.For instance, Solana’s relative strength index (purple) has fallen to almost 30, indicating an oversold position that should make the coin attractive to new buyers very soon.Source: TradingViewMeanwhile, SOL’s 30-day average (orange) is falling towards the 200-day (blue), and when it gets low enough a recovery should follow.It’s likely that any further dips in the near term will not be severe, given that Solana’s trading volume still remains relatively high, at around $3.3 billion today.What will be interesting is whether SOL’s support level (green) can prevent a concerted fall below $173.If it can, we may see a strong return to growth over the weekend, compensating for the past couple of days of stagnation.One thing that may boost the Solana price and the wider market is the incoming decision from the SEC regarding several spot-based ETH ETF applications.There are promising signs that the SEC will indeed approve these applications, with VanEck’s ETH ETF listed yesterday on the Depository Trust and Clearing Corporation (DTCC) under the ticker symbol ETHV.While this is obviously bullish for ETH, it will also be highly positive for Solana, and not simply in terms of raising a general appetite for big alts.In particular, it would pave the way for a spot-based Solana ETF, which would do for the Solana price what January’s BTC ETFs have done for Bitcoin.For this reason, we can expect the Solana price to reach $200 in the next few weeks, and $250 by the end of the summer, based on bullishness stemming from Ethereum ETF approvals.Diversification into New Altcoins for Big Returns
Solana certainly has good prospects, yet it isn’t the only promising alt in the market today, with a range of new meme coins looking very strong.While meme coins can be risky, one way of identifying more reliable candidates is to look for successful presales, which indicate market belief.And one new coin with a growing sale is WienerAI (WAI), a new Ethereum-based cryptocurrency that has raised over $2.7 million in its token offering.What’s special about WienerAI is that it’s more than another viral meme coin, with its platform also offering an AI-based trading bot.Answering queries from traders, WienerAI can identify high-potential coins before they begin rising, helping investors to make better informed choices.It will also provide an atomic swap feature, so that traders can buy new tokens quickly through the WienerAI app.Also helpful is its front-running protection, which will help investors trade ahead of MEV- and front running-bots.As a whole, such features mean that WAI will have plenty of utility as a token, something which will boost the market’s demand for it.It will have a max supply 69 billion tokens, while holders will be able to stake it for a passive income.VIDEOThis is why its sale is already doing so well, with latecomers able to join by going to the official WienerAI website and connecting their wallets.The coin is currently selling at $0.00071, a price which may end up seeming very cheap once the coin lists.Buy WAI Today

BTC, ETH Consolidate Ahead of Ether ETF Decision

Shares in Nvidia reached a record high during Wednesday's post-market hours after the company beat analyst estimates to report record revenue of $26.04 billion for the first quarter. The rally might be a positive signal for cryptocurrencies, including tokens supposedly associated with AI technology. This is because, historically, the inflow of money into the crypto market and the so-called AI coins has been partly contingent on outsized gains in NVDA and the tech-heavy Nasdaq index. Top AI coins such as FET, ICP, RNDR and GRT traded mixed, having rallied in the lead-up to the NVDA announcement, according to data by CoinGecko.

Solana Steps Up To The Plate: CEO Predicts It Could Be Next Crypto ETF


								The long-awaited approval of a spot exchange-traded fund (ETF) for Ethereum in the US seems imminent, and industry insiders are already looking ahead. Solana, a high-speed blockchain network, is emerging as a potential frontrunner for the next cryptocurrency ETF.

Brian Kelly, founder and CEO of BKCM LLC, believes Solana is a strong contender for an ETF due to its growing popularity and potential to be part of a “big three” alongside Bitcoin and Ethereum in the current crypto market cycle.
This sentiment aligns with the recent surge in anticipation surrounding Ethereum ETFs. The Securities and Exchange Commission’s (SEC) recent shift in stance, evident in the last-minute approval of Bitcoin futures ETFs in January, has fueled optimism for Ethereum and potentially other cryptocurrencies.


Investor Interest: A Mixed Bag
However, not everyone in the industry agreed with Kelly’s forecast.
According to Nate Geraci, president of The ETF Store, a spot Solana ETF won’t be available until Congress establishes a legal framework governing cryptocurrencies or until a Solana futures product traded on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange is listed.


As of right now, the United States has only authorized futures for Bitcoin (BTC) and Ether (ETH).
For his part, analyst Robert Mitchnick of Blackrock, a leading investment management firm, throws a bucket of cold water on the altcoin ETF party.
Mitchnick’s conversations with clients, based on a report, reveal “little interest” in altcoins like Ethereum, let alone lesser-known players. This suggests that even if the SEC greenlights an ETF, widespread investor adoption might be slow.

SOL market cap nearing the $80 billion level. Chart: TradingView.com
Interestingly, Europe appears to be ahead of the curve when it comes to Solana. Several exchange-traded products (ETPs) already exist there, highlighting a potential gap in the US market that a Solana ETF could fill.
Legal Status: A Potential Roadblock
While industry figures like Kelly are optimistic, a significant hurdle stands in the way of a Solana ETF: its legal classification. The SEC’s lawsuits against cryptocurrency exchanges Coinbase and Binance in 2023 named Solana as a security, not a commodity.

This distinction is crucial because ETFs traditionally deal with commodities, not securities. The Solana Foundation vehemently disputes the SEC’s claim, emphasizing the decentralized nature of its blockchain network. However, the legal ambiguity could lead to a lengthy approval process or even rejection by the SEC.
Solana: The Road Ahead
The success of an Ethereum ETF, if approved, will likely be a bellwether for future cryptocurrency ETFs, including SOL. Additionally, the SEC’s stance on Solana’s legal status needs clarification before any concrete progress can be made.

Ethereum beats Bitcoin in this area: Will ETH's growth continue? - AMBCrypto



Ethereum outperformed Bitcoin in terms of year to date growth.
Overall interest in Ethereum NFTs and its ecosystems fell significantly.

Ethereum [ETH] has had a tumultuous time in 2024, with prices seeing massive fluctuations during this period. Despite the volatile trajectory of ETH’s price movement, it has still managed to outperform BTC.
Ethereum comes out on top
According to Artemis’ data, Ethereum not only outperformed Bitcoin in 2024, but also managed to outpace tokens in other sectors such as AI, Data Services and RWA (Real World Assets).
Source: X
Interestingly, the surge in Ethereum’s price over the last year was driven by retail investors.
AMBCrypto’s analysis of Santiment’s data revealed that addresses holding anywhere between 0.1 to 10 ETH had accumulated large amounts of ETH over the last few months.
In contrast to that, whale investors were observed to be selling their holdings and were not showing any interest in accumulation.
This could be positive for Ethereum in the long run, as a presence of a large number of retail investors could make the Ethereum network much more decentralized.
However, large sell-offs from whales may impact the price movement of ETH negatively in the short term.
Source: Santiment
At press time, ETH was trading at $3,765.89 and its price had surged by 0.21% in the last 24 hours. Despite the surge in price, the Network Growth had plummeted over the last few days.
A decline in Network Growth indicates that the frequency with which new addresses were trading ETH had fallen significantly.
If new addresses continue to lose interest in ETH, it could impact ETH’s price negatively in the long run.
Moreover, the velocity at which ETH was trading at had also fallen, implying a decline in ETH’s overall trades.
Source: Santiment
Activity on the network
Another factor is the overall health of the Ethereum ecosystem.

Read Ethereum’s [ETH] Price Prediction 2024-25

Per AMBCrypto’s analysis of Santiment’s data, Daily Active Addresses on the Ethereum network had declined from 630,000 to 430,000 over the past few weeks.
This indicated that users were moving to other networks and platforms.

                        The approval of spot Ethereum exchange-traded funds (ETFs) in the United States could potentially trigger a substantial rally of up to 60% in the price of ETH.In a recent note, Singapore-based QCP Capital, said it has achieved this forecast by drawing parallels to the market reaction following the approval of spot Bitcoin ETFs earlier this year.QCP Capital pointed out that when spot bitcoin ETFs were approved in January, Bitcoin experienced a significant surge from $42,000 to over $73,000 within a two-week period after the ETFs began trading.“With Friday implied volatility above 100%, the market is expecting fireworks,” QCP Capital stated.Ether ETF Approval Might Be Around the Corner
The firm also mentioned that VanEck’s ETF had been listed by the Depository Trust & Clearing Corporation (DTCC), further indicating that approval for spot ether ETFs was highly likely, with trading expected to commence as early as next week.The measure of implied volatility reflects the market’s anticipation of future price fluctuations for a financial instrument.QCP Capital’s statement suggests that the current level of implied volatility in the market indicates strong expectations for significant price movement in response to the potential approval of spot ether ETFs.CryptoQuant, an on-chain analytics firm, reported increased buying activity on both centralized and blockchain-based crypto exchanges in a Wednesday report.On Tuesday, holders purchased over 100,000 ETH in spot markets, marking the highest daily level since September 2023.The surge in buying coincided with reports of a favorable decision regarding spot Ether ETFs, leading some analysts to increase the odds of approval to over 75%, up from the earlier estimate of 25%.Furthermore, open interest in ether-tracked futures reached a record high of $14 billion, accounting for 67% of bitcoin open interest as of Wednesday.CryptoQuant noted that traders appeared to be increasing their exposure to ETH relative to Bitcoin, and the buying activity from ETH permanent holders on that day was the largest seen in 2024 so far.ETH Price Might See Major Correction if ETFs Denied
However, QCP Capital’s analysts cautioned that a “significant price correction” could occur if the ETF application were to be dismissed.The reminder highlights the potential market volatility and uncertainty surrounding the outcome of the approval decision.Six issuers, including BlackRock, recently filed updated copies of their ether ETF proposals prior to the decision, removing plans to stake the token.The change suggests that staking activities may have posed regulatory obstacles.As of Thursday, data from popular staking service Lido indicated that annualized yields on ether staking were nearly 3%, further highlighting the potential value and income-generating opportunities associated with participating in staking activities.As reported, Fidelity made an amended S-1 application to SEC for its spot Ether ETF yesterday. The updated application specifies that the underlying Ether tokens of the ETF will not be staked.

Bankman-Fried Moves to New Facility While Fighting FTX Conviction


							

Sam Bankman-Fried, transferred to a California prison while appealing his 25-year conviction for fraud and money laundering.



The transfer process for Bankman-Fried is expected to be slow, taking over a month.



Bankman-Fried’s legal team appeals his 25-year sentence and $11 billion forfeiture.




Sam Bankman-Fried, the disgraced founder of the now-defunct cryptocurrency exchange FTX, is set to be transferred to a new prison as he prepares an appeal to overturn his conviction.



Wall Street Journal reports Bankman-Fried is likely to be moved to a medium-security facility in California. However, the exact location of the prison remains undisclosed.



The transfer process is expected to be slow, potentially taking over a month. This delay is partly due to a recommendation by the judge who presided over Bankman-Fried’s trial, suggesting that he should stay incarcerated in New York to facilitate access to his appellate counsel. Despite this recommendation, the decision has been made to relocate him.



Bankman-Fried was sentenced to 25 years in prison and ordered to forfeit $11 billion after being convicted on seven counts, including fraud, conspiracy, and money laundering. The charges stem from the collapse of FTX in November 2022, which followed a revelatory report by CoinDesk.









The report indicated that Alameda Research, a sister company to FTX, was in precarious financial health, leading to a rapid and dramatic downfall of the exchange, once the world’s third-largest.



The relocation of Bankman-Fried highlights the ongoing legal battles and the complexity of his case. His legal team is vigorously working on the appeal, aiming to overturn the convictions that have significantly impacted the cryptocurrency industry.



As the process unfolds, further details about the transfer and its implications for Bankman-Fried’s appeal will likely emerge, keeping the crypto community and legal observers closely watching.

Crypto Trader Books 735,800% Profit on Large-Cap Memecoin That’s Just Hit New All-Time High: On-Chain Data - The Daily Hodl


								An early buyer of a top-30 memecoin by market capitalization has turned a few hundred dollars into millions within a period of a little over a year.
According to blockchain tracker Lookonchain, the trader acquired billions of the Pepe (PEPE) memecoin days after it publicly launched.










The trader then sold 42 billion Pepe tokens on July 7th of 2023, 100 billion Pepe tokens on May 4th and the remainder on May 22nd, netting him approximately 735,831% in profits.
“An early buyer of PEPE deposited all 182.9 billion PEPE ($2.53 million) into Binance six hours ago.
This guy spent 0.22 Ethereum ($462) to buy 324.9 billion PEPE on April 15th, 2023 and sold it all for $3.4 million.
He was lucky enough to turn $462 into $3.4 million, a gain of 7,368x!”
PEPE is trading at $0.0000128 at time of writing, up by around 97% over the past 30 days.
The blockchain tracker also says that another trader who is still holding trillions of Pepe acquired between April 14th to April 23rd of 2023 is now sitting on a profit of over 95,000,000%.
“This diamond [hands] trader turned $83 into $79.4 million by buying and holding PEPE, a gain of 958,580x!
Three wallets(belonging to the same person) spent only 0.041 Ethereum ($83) to buy 6.44 trillion PEPE ($79.4 million), and have never sold any PEPE to date.”
Lookonchain further says that crypto investment firm BlockTower Capital booked a profit of over 20% after selling a stash of Pepe on the institutional trading platform Cumberland.
“BlockTower Capital transferred 202 billion PEPE ($2.8 million) to Cumberland for sale two hours ago after the PEPE price broke through $0.000014.
BlockTower Capital bought the 202 billion PEPE ($2.22 million) via Cumberland six days ago.
Making $578,000 in six days, with a return on investment of 26%.”

BJ's Wholesale Club: Q1 Net Sales Up 4% But Operating Income Falls 13.9% - Tokenist


					
Neither the author, Tim Fries, nor this website, The Tokenist, provide financial advice. Please consult our website policy prior to making financial decisions.



BJ’s Wholesale Club Holdings, Inc. (NYSE: BJ) reported its financial results for the first quarter of fiscal 2024, showcasing a mixed performance across various metrics. The company experienced a 4.0% year-over-year increase in net sales, reaching $4.81 billion, while total revenues grew by 4.1% to $4.92 billion. Membership fee income saw a notable rise of 8.6%, amounting to $111.4 million. However, the company faced challenges in its merchandise gross margin rate, which decreased by 50 basis points due to lower ancillary income. Operating income also declined by 13.9%, falling to $160.8 million from $186.8 million in the same quarter of the previous year.



Despite these setbacks, BJ’s Wholesale Club managed to maintain a steady earnings per diluted share (EPS) of $0.83, with an adjusted EPS of $0.85. The company’s comparable club sales increased by 1.6% year-over-year, although this growth was more modest at 0.6% when excluding gasoline sales. Digitally enabled comparable sales growth was a standout, soaring by 21.0% year-over-year, reflecting the company’s successful push into digital conveniences and e-commerce. Additionally, BJ’s opened one new club and one new gas station during the quarter, contributing to its strategic growth initiatives.



BJ’s Wholesale Club Beats EPS and Revenue Expectations in Q1



When comparing the current quarter’s performance to expectations, BJ’s Wholesale Club met the anticipated EPS of $0.83, and the adjusted EPS figure exceeded expectations.



Revenue for the quarter was $4.81 billion, slightly below the expected $4.85 billion. This shortfall can be attributed to various factors, including increased selling, general, and administrative expenses (SG&A), which rose to $721.8 million from $689.3 million the previous year. The rise in SG&A expenses was primarily driven by increased labor and occupancy costs due to new club and gas station openings and other investments aimed at driving strategic priorities.



The company’s net income for the first quarter of fiscal 2024 decreased to $111.0 million from $116.1 million in the same period of fiscal 2023. Adjusted EBITDA also saw a decline, dropping to $236.4 million from $251.5 million year-over-year. Despite these declines, BJ’s Wholesale Club’s adjusted EPS remained consistent at $0.85, indicating that the company managed to control costs and maintain profitability on an adjusted basis. However, the decrease in operating income and net income highlights the challenges the company faced in managing expenses amidst its expansion efforts.





BJ’s Wholesale Club Remains Optimistic for FY 2024



BJ’s Wholesale Club remains optimistic about its growth prospects for the rest of fiscal 2024. The company’s outlook remains unchanged, focusing on maintaining strength in traffic, unit volumes, and market share. “As we look ahead to the rest of the year, we remain confident in our ability to maintain our strength in traffic, unit volumes and market share led by our continued focus on delivering value to our members and executing on our strategic priorities,” said Laura Felice, Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer of BJ’s Wholesale Club.



The company plans to open a total of 12 new clubs this year, which is expected to further enhance its market presence and drive revenue growth. BJ’s Wholesale Club’s strategic priorities include enhancing its merchandising improvements and digital conveniences to provide compelling value to its members.

What are Bitcoin Runes? New Token Standard on the Bitcoin Network

Bitcoin Runes is a token standard that provides much more efficient methods to create new fungible tokens. Created by Casey Rodarmor, it was launched on the 4th Bitcoin halving day and on the 840,000th block. 
Runes employ an efficient method of creating new cryptocurrencies from unspent transaction outputs (UTXOs) which till now just went to junk. 
The protocol brings great relief to developers, miners, creators and also to the entire ecosystem which has been reeling with the after effects of Bitcoin Halving. The protocol has several advantages over its predecessor and would likely see the same shining fate as of its senior cousin, the Bitcoin Ordinals.
Introduction
Bitcoin Runes is a token standard that guides developers in the creation of new cryptocurrencies. These new cryptocurrencies are created as fungible tokens and can be easily developed with a little knowledge. 
The protocol was created by Casey Rodarmor who was also responsible for creating the Bitcoin Ordinals. The Ordinals protocol was key in introducing NFT-like features on the Bitcoin blockchain, something which was much greater than any expectation. 
This article explores every aspect of Bitcoin Runes, be it around its benefits, improvements over predecessors, technical information, jargons and also disadvantages. At the end we have also provided a few comments on its sustainability and its future.
Who Created The Runes Protocol
The Runes Protocol was first proposed by Casey Rodarmor, who also created the famous Bitcoin Ordinals in December 2022. Casey’s proposal sought to address the problems of BRC-20 protocol which left a huge amount of junk in the form of unspent transaction outputs or UTXOs. These UTXOs were created as a result of every successful transaction.
In the Bitcoin network, transaction outputs work in a similar way as “gas” in Ethereum but in a slightly different way. Consider that you were buying something worth $4.93 with a $5 bill. Now imagine what would happen if people could only transact with notes and no one accepted coins. Obviously, the 7 cent worth of coins would go to waste. 
The Bitcoin UTXOs are small quantities of Bitcoins that are used to pay for transaction fees. They are very similar to the loose 7 cents that no one accepts.
Motive for Creating Bitcoin Runes
The Bitcoin Runes were created primarily as an easy way to create memecoin-like cryptocurrencies. Upon seeing the success of memecoins in Solana (BONK, dogwifhat, and others), he was looking for a way to implement it in the Bitcoin network.
Here is a tweet from the creator himself on why he created Bitcoin Runes.

Though the BRC-20 protocol existed which creates cryptocurrencies on the Bitcoin network, yet it was a resource intensive method and left a huge signature of UTXOs much like an old car leaves a smoke trail.
Runes were a much simpler way of creating new coins. The protocol does not depend on any other protocol such as BRC-20 or Ordinals and is self-contained which means all its dependencies are already present inside it.
Terms and Definitions Associated with Bitcoin Runes
Struct
A struct or structure in the context of Bitcoin is a set of instructions that guide an activity inside the Bitcoin blockchain.
Runestone
A runestone is a message that is used to send parameters to the Bitcoin network on how the fungible token (Rune) should be created.
A runestone looks in a similar way as below.

“`rust
struct Runestone1 {
edicts: Vec<Edicts>,
etching: Option<Etching>,
mint: Option <RuneID>,
pointer: Option <u32>’
}
“`

Each Runestone is capable of transferring multiple types of fungible tokens within a single output.
Etching
Etching is the process of inscribing a transaction output with a message (runestone) that contains details of the fungible token that is to be created. The message contains details such as name, quantity, symbol, etc. 
UTXO
An UTXO is a collection of satoshis (100 Mn Satoshis = 1 Bitcoin) that are used to pay for transaction fees on the Bitcoin network. When a transaction output becomes so small that it cannot be used to pay for network fee, it goes to junk. The Runes protocol is key to manage these junk UTXOs.
Cenotaphs
Those runestones which have some kind of an error are called cenotaphs. These errors may have been introduced due to bad parameters, any network clog or any other random factor.
How Does it Work?
Overview
The Runes Protocol works in a way which is known by the OP_RETURN method. 

First, with each transaction, a set of parameters are given to the Bitcoin network. This process is known as etching.
After a successful transaction, these parameters define the output. The parameters contain information as to how the UTXOs will be converted into new fungible tokens. The process is called minting.
The next step involves transferring a rune from a transaction input to output. This process is called an edict.
At the end of the transaction, the user receives fungible tokens on their address.

Let us now break down the steps to understand the process in a much more detailed manner
Etching
Etching is the process of creating a Bitcoin Rune by sending token parameters to a transaction input.
The list of parameters that are sent along with a transaction output are:

Name: The name simply refers to the name of the fungible token to be minted. 
Divisibility factor: This is the number of units a rune can be divided into.
Symbol: This refers to the symbol of the new fungible token or tokens.
Premine: It refers to the initial allocation of the runes that are kept for its creator.
Terms: Refers to the rules that are to be followed by users during an open mint.
Cap: It refers to the number of times a rune should be minted.
Amount: This refers to the numeric quantity of the rune to be minted. A single UTXO can mint multiple fungible tokens at once.
Start height: This is the block height where the minting of the rune starts.
End height: This is the block height where the minting of the rune ends.
Edict: These are messages that contain instructions on how a transaction input can be converted into an output.

Minting
Minting refers to the process of converting the unspent transaction outputs(UTXOs) into new fungible tokens. The UTXOs are converted into runes through a function called OP RETURN. This function returns the UTXOs in the form of new fungible tokens.
Transfer
The next step involves transferring a rune from input to output. These transfers are governed by edicts which are messages that are sent to describe the specifications of a rune.
Here is a sample of an edict:

“`rust
struct Edict {
id: RuneID,
amount: u128,
output: u32,
}
“`

Each runestone can create multiple types of fungible tokens with just a single input. This is a great improvement over earlier protocols where only a single type of fungible token was created at one time.
To do that, we just need to define each output with a separate edict.
For example, let’s say we have an UTXO that we wish to convert into fungible tokens. With Runes, we can not only do that but also achieve something that was impossible prior to this. For example, a single UTXO can create  1000 tokens of A type, 20 tokens of B type and 5 tokens of C type. 
Bitcoin Runes vs BRC 20s
Bitcoin Runes provide several upgrades over BRC-20 protocol and these upgrades define the difference between the two.

UTXOs are repurposed on Runes whereas they are discarded on the BRC-20 protocol.
The fungible tokens created using Runes protocol can be transferred on Layer-2 solutions like the Lightning Network, whereas BRC-20 tokens cannot be transferred using L2s.
Runes are based on UTXOs whereas BRC-20 tokens are based on Ordinals theory.





Bitcoin Runes vs Bitcoin Ordinals
Runes are a protocol that uses UTXOs to create new fungible tokens. On the other hand Ordinals use satoshis to create inscriptions that lead to the creation of non-fungible assets.
What Does Runes Offer to the Bitcoin Ecosystem?
Runes offer a great benefit to the entire Bitcoin network. 
Reduces Wastage of UTXOs
First, it reduces the junk that is created by UTXOs. With Runes, these UTXOs can be converted into useful tokens with a simple OP_RETURN method.
More Users and Greater Liquidity
Second, it brings more liquidity to the Bitcoin ecosystem. Due to the bullishness around memecoins, Runes would be able to bring more users and liquidity to the Bitcoin ecosystem. Just like other ecosystems, Runes have capability to drive memecoin rally into the Bitcoin ecosystem. More tokens would attract more users and hence more liquidity.
More Fees to Miners
Third, it brings more fees to the miners. More transactions would definitely generate more fees which would compensate miners in a better way. Further, after the Bitcoin Halving event, miners desperately need more fees to cover operational costs. 

Suggested Reading: What is Bitcoin Halving: A Comprehensive Guide

Runes have already generated the traffic that could fulfill the needs of the miners. However, its sustainability is in question. If it goes in the Ordinal way, it would surely compensate Bitcoin miners in a sustainable way.
Advantages over Other Protocols
There are several advantages associated with the launch of the Runes protocol. Some of them are:
Improvement Over BRC-20

The main intention of creating runes was to establish a token minting process that would not be as messy as the BRC-20 protocol which left a huge trail of UTXOs after each transaction.
The Runes protocol on the other hand, managed these UTXOs in a clean way by allowing users to repurpose them as new tokens.
Works Well on Bitcoin Layer-2 Solutions

Runes work well on Layer-2 protocols such as the Lightning Network. However, BRC_20 protocols do not work in Bitcoin L2s.
Simplified Token Minting Process

With the Runes protocol, minting a new token on the Bitcoin blockchain would be at its easiest. This has already begun in great numbers. A few Runes-based tokens are:

Satoshi Nakamoto
The Ticker Elsa
Wanko Manko Runes
Meme Economics
LOBO The Wolf Pup

Are There Any Disadvantages?
Despite all the advantages, there has been an unintended consequence of Bitcoin Ordinals. As a result of their immense popularity, just like Ordinals, Bitcoin Runes too have clogged the Bitcoin blockchain. Despite being an unintended act, this congestion has led to a spike in fees.
Bitcoin Runes Creates Spike in Bitcoin Fees
On April 20th, 2024, the day of launch of the Runes protocol, there was a clog in the Bitcoin network which spiked its fee to $128 per transaction as compared to its usual fee of $5 to $10 per transaction. Although the major reason for the spike was the race to transact on the 840,000th block (the halving block), yet Runes were a major contributor to the spike in the  transactions.
What’s Next for Runes?
If the development of Runes continues in the future, we see a thriving ecosystem. Runes have the capability to bring DeFi to the Bitcoin blockchain, something that every Bitcoiners wants in the ecosystem. Though some rudimentary DeFi capabilities exist on Bitcoin, yet the network is far from achieving the feats of Ethereum.
Conclusion
Bitcoin Runes are a new improvement over BRC-20 protocol to create new tokens. The Runes protocol utilizes a new way to create cryptocurrencies with the Unspent Transaction Outputs (UTXOs). This method not only reduces junk UTXOs but also converts them into something useful. 
The protocol is expected to bring much relief to the Bitcoin ecosystem in terms of users, miner fees and liquidity. Also, it is expected to bring much greater DeFi capabilities to the Bitcoin ecosystem, something which is much desired. Finally, we expect Runes to have a stable presence in the Bitcoin network so that it not only improves the network’s capabilities but also helps Bitcoin achieve the tag of a true market dominator.

WIF’s 18.33% Surge in 24 Hours Signals Memecoins Season Return, BBG Next! - Coin Edition


							

Dogwifhat (WIF), a Solana-based memecoin, surged 18.33% in the last 24 hours.
WIF’s rally signals a potential return of the memecoins season.
Investors look toward BBG, as a target for massive profit in the upcoming bull run.




Dogwifhat (WIF), a Solana-based memecoin, surged 18.33% in the last 24 hours, per TradingView’s data, delivering early signals of a return of the memecoin season. The novel memecoin launched six months ago but was one of the most profitable cryptocurrencies in Q1 2024, rallying over 2,100% in its first bullish trend.



WIF’s Q1 rally is typical of memecoins behavior that distinguishes the crypto category as a speculative opportunity for digital asset investors. Most top memecoins typically have that one season of ballistic movement before settling into the broader crypto market dynamics.



After WIF’s significant rally in Q1 2024, many crypto users are paying close attention to the next viable option. Top on the crypto users’ list is the Barbie Girl (BBG) memecoin, based on Binance’s BNBChain.



For those who may have missed the initial WIF rally, the BBG could present an opportunity for significant profit-making in crypto investment. It is a memecoin project that launched towards the end of 2023 but is only beginning to ramp up activities that could lead to massive adoption.



BBG’s social status is growing significantly following the project’s attractive marketing strategies. At the end of April, BBG announced a bonus plan for referring users on its platform. The novel memecoin project offers a 10% bonus to existing users who convince others to buy the BBG token. 



Crypto users seeking to benefit from the program would first sign up on the BBG website and buy at least $1 worth of the token to get a referral code. The users can share their referral codes unlimitedly and earn 10% of the value invested by anyone using them.



Many crypto users consider this a timely strategy, given the growing memecoins awareness and crypto users’ openness toward adopting the technology. WIF has signaled the potential return of the memecoin season, and crypto users are watching BBG as the next big thing regarding the memecoins rally.

Santiment Warns These Popular Altcoin Investors: A $52 Million Dump May Come! - Bitcoin Sistemi


While there has been a rise in Ethereum ETFs in recent days, Santiment warned investors about the popular artificial intelligence altcoin RNDR.
Render Network (RNDR), one of the leading names in the artificial intelligence industry, has been the subject of notable whale activities and an upward trend with its rise in recent weeks.


Stating that at this point, a large whale sent 4.89 million RNDR tokens worth approximately $ 52.1 million to an unknown wallet, Santiment stated that this transfer could cause potential fluctuations in the RNDR price in the near future.
At this point, Santiment recommends that those holding RNDR keep a close eye on the market as there may be increased volatility on the horizon. Because large transactions made by whales can often lead to price fluctuations.






“Whaling activity is high among the AI sector and Render is no exception.
A known whale sent 4.89 million RNDR (worth $52.1 million) to an unknown wallet earlier today as prices corrected.
“Investors holding this asset should beware of increased volatility.”

RNDR continues to trade at $10.55 at the time of writing.

In the fast-paced world of cryptocurrency, Ethereum (ETH) has recently captured attention with a notable surge in a critical metric that could shape its future trajectory. CryptoQuant, a leading market analytics platform, has highlighted a significant development in the perpetual futures market that may influence Ethereum’s price dynamics moving forward.The focal point of interest is the seven-day moving average of the Taker Buy Sell Ratio on the Ethereum perpetual futures market. This metric serves as a crucial indicator of market sentiment, reflecting whether buyers or sellers dominate market orders. A ratio below 1 indicates a higher prevalence of selling pressure, whereas a ratio above 1 suggests increasing buyer activity.Recent trends and market implicationsFor the past several months, the Taker Buy Sell Ratio for Ethereum has consistently been below 1, signaling heightened selling activity. Analysts attribute this trend to speculative trading or hedging strategies among investors. Despite this prolonged period of bearish sentiment, recent data indicates a noteworthy shift. The ratio has begun to show a gradual increase, now approaching 1.This uptick in the Taker Buy Sell Ratio coincides with a significant rise in Ethereum’s market price. As of the latest report, Ethereum is trading at $3,833, marking an impressive 27.76% increase over the past week. Such price movements are closely tied to market sentiment and trading activities on the futures market.Potential market dynamics shiftAnalysts suggest that the rising Taker Buy Sell Ratio may indicate a potential shift in market dynamics. If this trend continues, it could alleviate the intense selling pressure that has characterized the Ethereum futures market in recent months. With increased demand from the spot market and a reduction in aggressive selling, Ethereum’s current uptrend may sustain itself in the near term.Overall, monitoring key metrics such as the Taker Buy Sell Ratio becomes increasingly important. The recent increase in this ratio, combined with Ethereum’s notable price surge, presents a cautiously optimistic outlook for investors and traders alike. Market participants will be closely watching these developments to gauge Ethereum’s future price movements and market sentiment.

Little Known Meme Coin CorgiAI Up 60%, Flips Pepecoin and Memecoin - Decrypt

We do the research, you get the alpha!Get exclusive reports and access to key insights on airdrops, NFTs, and more! Subscribe now to Alpha Reports and up your game!Go to Alpha ReportsA relatively unknown meme coin, CorgiAI, has become the eighth largest meme coin by market cap according to CoinGecko.The token flipped Pepecoin, Memecoin, and TRUMP by skyrocketing 60% over the past 24 hours and 102% over the past week. CorgiAI is within flipping distance of Book of Meme, with a market capitalization of over $800 million, according to CronoScan.This figure is similar to what is reported on CoinGecko and CoinMarketCap, although the latter indicates it has been self-reported by CorgiAI (CORGIAI) and not been verified. Meme coins are by nature very volatile, since CorgiAI’s creation a year ago the token has seen similarly huge swings three times already. CorgiAI's smart contract also includes a mint function, according to GoPlusLabs, meaning more tokens can be created if exercised so proceed with caution.CorgiAI is a community driven meme coin on the Cronos network which aims to use artificial intelligence (AI) to build tools. The most recent example of this is the Corgi Cre8r, an NFT text-to-image AI generator.Cronos is a layer-1 blockchain which is capable of interoperating with Ethereum and Cosmos. It was created by Crypto.com in partnership with Cronos Labs. Its CRO token is currently sitting at a $3.4 million market cap, according to CoinGecko.Despite being around for a while, the chain has made relatively little noise in terms of meme coins. In an attempt to address this, the chain decided to promote its native meme coins through a campaign which gave users the opportunity to win token rewards and an exclusive NFT.The “Cronos Spring Odyssey: Memecoin Trails,” asked participants to follow the tokens Twitter account, like and retweet a post, as well as buy and hold $5 of CorgiAI. Since this campaign began, the token has skyrocketed 97%, according to CoinGecko. In turn, it is now the fifth largest token on Cronos behind USDC, Wrapped Bitcoin, Maker stablecoin DAI, and the network’s native CRO.While 10 other tokens were part of the campaign, CorgiAI saw the most significant gains. Crow with knife is in second seeing 14.3% gains over the past 24 hours, reaching a $55,000 market cap.This may be because CorgiAI has also been running allow list campaigns and giveaways on their Twitter. These campaigns, run through GALXE Quest, had similar requirements to the Cronos Spring Odyssey with Twitter interactions combined with buying and holding tokens providing an entry.Edited by Stacy Elliott.Daily Debrief NewsletterStart every day with the top news stories right now, plus original features, a podcast, videos and more.

US CBDC, FIT21 crypto bills: 'A lip service' or balanced regulation? - AMBCrypto



The US House passed the FIT21 Act to set regulatory clarity for crypto. 
Next on the line is the US CBDC bill and how the US Senate handles both. 

US crypto regulation has recorded significant progress as digital assets became a political and contentious issue ahead of the US elections. 
After the successful repeal of SEC’s Staff Accounting Bulletin 121 (SAB 121) on 16th May, more progress on crypto regulation has been made this week. 
On 22nd May, the US House of Representatives voted and passed the Financial Innovation and Technology for the 21st Century Act, known as the FIT21 Act. Despite President Joe Biden’s opposition to the FIT21 crypto bill, it passed with bipartisan support. 
FIT21 crypto bill
The FIT21 bill aims to establish a regulatory framework for digital assets in the US. Notably, the bill seeks to offer the bulk of the crypto oversight to CTFC (Commodity Futures Trading Commission), an entity viewed as less hostile to the industry compared to the SEC. 
However, the SEC will retain authority on digital assets that fall within the ‘security’ definition. Coinbase founder Brian Armstrong called the FIT21 Act update a ‘historic vote’ for crypto regulation and clarity if passed into law. 
“Historic vote today on the FIT21 bill in the House of Representatives, that will finally start to create some clear rules to regulate crypto”
The Blockchain Association, for its part, referred to the development as a ‘watershed moment’ for the crypto industry. 
Interestingly, the update also prompted the White House’s reaction. The administration registered its opposition to the FIT21 Act but maintained its willingness to work for a ‘balanced’ regulatory framework for digital assets. 
Reacting to the White House’s statement, Bloomberg ETF analyst James Seyffart called it a ‘lip service.’
“What are the odds that this is just lip service? I guess time will tell”
The next step for the Republican-sponsored FIT21 Act will be the Senate. However, market watchers believe that the progress could pause until the next congress picks it up in January 2025. 
After FIT21 Act, House to vote on US CBDC
The US House of Representatives will now vote on another crypto bill, the CBDC Anti-Surveillance State Act, HR 5043, this week. The bill seeks to bar the Federal Reserve from issuing CBDC (Central Bank Digital Currency), also known as a digital dollar, or using it as a monetary policy tool. 
The bill was introduced by Tom Emmer, the Republican House Majority whip, who maintained that the US CBDC pushed by the Fed would threaten Americans’ privacy. 
“The Biden Administration has proven they are itching to trade Americans’ right to privacy for a CCP-style CBDC surveillance tool.”
Should both bills pass the US House and Senate and become law, they could provide the regulatory clarity the industry has long sought.

Robinhood Taps 0x For Gasless Swaps On Arbitrum - The Defiant

Robinhood introduced support for swaps on Arbitrum in February.Robinhood, a commission-free trading platform, is launching gas-free trading on Arbitrum, the largest Ethereum Layer 2 network by TVL.Robinhood launched the feature on May 23, allowing users to execute gasless trades on the Arbitrum network via Robinhood Wallet. 0x, a decentralized exchange protocol, will provide decentralized exchange aggregation services for Robinhood.Robinhood said 0x will provide traders with the best price quote available to traders. Users can also route trades incurring gas fees should they offer a better price than gasless trades.“Users can swap without needing ETH for gas on Arbitrum, with 0x as the DEX aggregator behind the activation,” Robinhood said.The news follows Robinhood teaming up with Arbitrum in February to offer traders access to swaps via Arbitrum-based decentralized exchanges.“Accessing and transacting on L2s has historically been difficult to non-crypto natives, but Robinhood Wallet now helps strip away the complexities to help onboard those new to web3,” said Johann Kerbrat, General Manager of Robinhood Crypto.Robinhood expands crypto offeringsRobinhood first began providing crypto trading services in February 2018 with the launch of Bitcoin and Ethereum markets across five U.S. states. “Cryptocurrencies have become the first foray into investing and financial services to a large number of people,” said Robinhood co-founder, Vlad Tenev.Robinhood began expanding its roster of cryptocurrencies with the addition of Bitcoin Cash and Litecoin in July 2018, alongside the introduction of support for on-chain cryptocurrency transfers. By 2021, Robinhood users in all but two U.S. states could access its cryptocurrency markets.In March 2021, Robinhood announced plans to ship a non-custodial cryptocurrency wallet, following up with a beta launch of the Polygon-powered wallet to 10,000 iOS users in September 2022. Robinhood Wallet became available to all iOS users in March 2023 and Android users in March of this year.In December 2023, Robinhood rolled out crypto trading for European users, also announcing plans to bring the service to U.K. customers in 2024. The company launched a custodial Solana (SOL) staking service for European customers last week.However, Robinhood’s crypto business suffered a blow in the U.S. on May 4 when it received a Wells Notice from the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). A Wells Notice is issued when the regulator completes an investigation concluding that the recipient has infringed securities law, and typically precedes a formal complaint.The notice came despite Robinhood delisting Solana, Cardano, and Polygon after the assets were named as securities assets in the SEC’s lawsuits against Coinbase and Binance.

Xapo Launches Lightning Network Deposits Amid Growing Adoption In Key Latin Markets - The Defiant

Argentina and Brazil accounted for 43% of Lightning Network payments executed via Xapo in March.Xapo Bank, the pioneering digital asset custodian and bank, is the first fully licensed bank to support Bitcoin deposits via Lightning Network.Announced on May 23, the move allows Xapo’s global custodians to deposit BTC using Lightning Network, the payments-focussed Bitcoin Layer 2, via Lightspark, a firm providing Lightning Network-based payments infrastructure. Xapo does not charge fees for users depositing via Lightning Network.“We believe in the Lightning Network’s future as the primary avenue for Bitcoin transactions, especially for daily, small-scale exchanges,” said Seamus Rocca, CEO of Xapo Bank.“Today's Bitcoin users seek not only to store their wealth but also to integrate Bitcoin into their daily transactions seamlessly,” said David Marcus, CEO and Co-Founder of Lightspark.Coinbase, the largest U.S. centralized exchange, similarly tapped LightSpark to launch support for Lightning Network payments three weeks ago.The move follows Xapo introducing support for Lightning Network payments last year.Adoption of the service recently spiked, with the number of Lightning Network payments executed via Xapo increased by 44% from February through March 2024, with Argentinian and Brazilian users accounting for 29% and 14% of transactions, respectively.Xapo noted that the countries have historically experienced high inflation, bolstering the value proposition of Bitcoin for local users.According to Look Into Bitcoin, 4,868.2 BTC worth nearly $337.7 million is currently locked on the Lightning Network.Xapo was among the first firms to provide Bitcoin services to the Latin American market. The company was founded by Wences Caseras, an entrepreneur who launched the first internet service provider in Argentina in 1994.Caseras became interested in Bitcoin after his family was severely impacted by rampant inflation and stringent capital controls in Argentina. After investing in BTC, Caseras built a “vault” to store his Bitcoin, which became the foundation for Xapo.Caseras went on to found the Lemon Bitcoin wallet in 2012, and Xapo in the following year. Xapo’s institutional custody business was acquired by Coinbase in 2019. Xapo Bank became a fully licensed digital bank under the Gibraltar Financial Services Commission in 2021.

Satoshi-Era Bitcoin Miner Awakens: 2,000 BTC Moved in One Go

According to Julio Moreno, head of research at CryptoQuant, an early Bitcoin miner from the Satoshi era has moved 2,000 BTC. This activity involved coins mined in 2010, a time when Bitcoin's value was negligible compared to today's prices."Satoshi era" refers to the period when Bitcoin's pseudonymous creator, Satoshi Nakamoto, was active in the community, roughly between 2009 and 2010.  Bitcoin mined during the early years (2009-2011) is considered part of Bitcoin’s foundational history. Transactions involving these coins are rare and often attract considerable attention. This is often because old Bitcoin miners act as a source of liquidity and distribution.The transfer was notable not only for its size but also because it involved coins that had been held for roughly 14 years. The motivation behind moving such a significant amount of Bitcoin after a prolonged period can vary. Some potential reasons include: the holder might seek to capitalize on current market prices or to fund new ventures or investments. Sometimes, old addresses move small amounts to test modern transaction capabilities and security before deciding on larger moves.It is also possible that the owner might be moving their holdings to enhance security, utilizing modern wallets with advanced security features compared to older ones. The movement might be part of a broader market strategy, such as preparing for a large sale through over-the-counter (OTC) markets.According to Moreno, the latter scenario might be the case. He speculates that the coins likely went to an OTC desk or custodian, given that they were forwarded to several other new addresses almost immediately.At the time of writing, BTC was down 0.5% in the last 24 hours to $69,681. At current prices, the value of the transferred 2,000 BTC would be worth nearly $130 million.

Gold Pepe (GOLDPEPE) to Explode 11,000% Ahead of KuCoin Listing, While Shiba Inu and Dogecoin Lag



                    

Gold Pepe (GOLDPEPE) could become a viral memecoin, like Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE).



Gold Pepe (GOLDPEPE), a Solana memecoin that was launched this week, is aiming to challenge other memecoin giants, such as Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE).




Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Gold Pepe presents a similar opportunity.



Gold Pepe has a market cap below $15,000 at the moment, meaning that when it just reaches a modest market cap of $400,000-$800,000, early investors would generate returns of 2,000%-5,000% in a matter of days or hours.



The exciting memecoin is poised to rally 11,000% in the coming two days before it will be listed on KuCoin – a massive cryptocurrency exchange – and Gold Pepe could potentially reach a multi-million dollar market cap within a few weeks.




Currently, Gold Pepe can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jupiter and Raydium, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days.



To buy Gold Pepe on these platforms, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Gold Pepe by entering its contract address – 5EZoavSMtfuq3dQuyQsYqUgmD7avZJEZMYpLtpZFBgYz – in the receiving field.



In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price.



If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner.




The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum.



This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like GOLDPEPE.

Nvidia Earnings Propel AI Stocks While AI Crypto Dips

                        Nvidia’s impressive Q1 earnings report caused AI-related stocks to surge, but AI crypto has not followed suit despite Crypto trader’s expectations.On May 22, Nvidia released its Q1 earnings report. Revenue jumped 18% from the previous quarter and surged 262% year-over-year, beating analyst estimates of $24.6 billion.The earnings report was released after the NYSE market closed on May 22. However, Nvidia’s stock spiked 6.06% in after-hours trading, reaching $1,007 and pushing its market capitalization to over $2.5 trillion.Anticipating Nvidia’s earnings report, investors expected a positive outcome to be a catalyst for AI-related cryptocurrencies.This led many AI-related projects to rally hard ahead of the report, as investors scrambled to capitalise on the best AI cryptocurrencies.AI Crypto Falls Despite Nvidia Earnings
Immediately following Nvidia’s earnings report, tokens such as Fetch.ai (FET), The Graph (GRT), Injective (INJ), Render (RNDR), and SingularityNET (AGIX) did jump higher. However, many of them have since started to retrace.With Nvidia and other AI-focused companies performing so well in the stock market, the question many investors are now asking is whether AI-related crypto tokens will also benefit from the bullish sentiment surrounding AI.Notably, On May 22, a known “whale” wallet transferred approximately $52.1 million worth of Render to an unknown wallet, as reported by Santiment. This could indicate that holders were anticipating a “sell the news” event.However, this initial retracement might precede a rally. Pseudonymous crypto trader D0c Crypto pointed out that RNDR didn’t experience a price spike until 48 hours after Nvidia’s previous earnings report during an X post.This marks a potential opportunity to enter the market and see further gains following the Nvidia earnings report, as well as a potential buying opportunity.Although this sentiment does pose some potential gains, the aforementioned AI crypto projects are limited due to their high market capitalization. Consequently, traders looking for quicker and bigger gains may do well to investigate some of the newer low-cap AI coins currently doing the rounds.Meet Crypto’s First AI Trading Companion: WienerAI

Crypto Update: Meme Coins Steal Spotlight as Bitcoin Reaches $71K


							

PEPE has soared by 63.63% to reach $0.00001467, setting a new all-time high.



Similarly, Solana meme coins BONK, WIF, and BOME, surged by over 30%.



However, Shiba Inu shoulders a 3% loss in the cumulative seven-day trajectory.




The meme coin landscape is once again leading the narrative as the crypto market enters the second phase of the bull cycle. With Bitcoin returning to the $71K range, some meme coins have taken the spotlight from Bitcoin, registering significant double -digit percentage growth.



Take PEPE, for example, which was trading at a mere $0.000008947 just a week ago. Today, it has skyrocketed by 63.63% to reach $0.00001467, setting a new all-time high.



Similarly, Solana’s premier meme coin, BONK, sold for $0.00002367 on May 16. By May 23, BONK had achieved a 46.39% rally that took its market value to $0.00003465.



Dogwifhat (WIF) and BOME, other prominent meme coins in the Solana ecosystem, have recorded a similar 30% uptick in their seven-day trajectory. Meanwhile, Shiba Inu, the second most valuable meme coin, has been on the sidelines while WIF, BOME, PEPE, and BONK surged.



Currently, Shiba Inu bears a 3% loss in the cumulative seven-day trajectory, making it the only prominent meme coin yet to commence its bullish resurgence with Bitcoin’s comeback.



Nonetheless, market analysts are confident that Shiba Inu’s next explosive gains are just around the corner. In a recent update, analyst Clifton highlighted the formation of a bullish pennant on Shiba Inu’s chart. Analysts Davie and “Word of Charts” have noted similar observations in separate analyses of Shiba Inu.









For context, a bullish pennant formation indicates that an asset is poised to continue an uptrend that began earlier before encountering temporary resistance. In Shiba Inu’s case, SHIB experienced an aggressive uptrend in early March that took its value to $0.000045 but then lost momentum.



These market watchers believe Shiba Inu could surpass the $0.00005 threshold during its comeback. Currently, SHIB trades at $0.00002533, down 3% in the last 24 hours.

5 of the Best DeFi Lending Protocols for Taking Full Advantage of the Crypto Bull Market - CoinJournal



                    

                    It’s no secret that crypto is in the midst of a multi-year bull market right now with leading assets such as BTC and ETH chasing all-time highs and most other tokens, including memecoins, going from strength to strength. It’s also no secret that there’s never enough capital to buy all of the assets on your bull market wish list.
Lending protocols provide a solution to this, allowing DeFi users to deposit one asset, such as ETH or BTC, and borrow stablecoins, which can then be swapped for other assets, be it AI tokens, RWA assets, or memecoins. When used responsibly, lending allows savvy DeFi users to maximize their gains. They can capitalize on the upside to their collateral increasing in value while also using their borrowed assets to make additional gains.

But the lending protocol you choose will dictate the assets you can deposit, the ways you can utilize your borrowed funds, the interest you’ll pay, and the lending-borrowing ratio you can maintain. Here are five of the best lending protocols that will give you the most bang for your buck.
Nolus
Nolus is a cross-chain lending protocol that’s on the up. There’s a respectable $3.3M in TVL and $55M in volume since it launched less than a year ago. There are two things that make Nolus an ideal solution when operating in a bull market. Firstly, there’s its ingenious provision of up to 150% financing – 3x the industry average – through its DeFi Lease product. This allows lenders to obtain the maximum available capital and thus earn the maximum available yield.
As for how Nolus achieves this without increasing liquidation risk, it’s because both the staked asset – the down payment – and the borrowed asset are combined to acquire the asset the user desires. By pooling these sources, it’s possible to access much greater capital than would otherwise be available. The second neat thing about Nolus is that it doesn’t liquidate the user’s position in full should they become under-collateralized. Rather, it administers partial liquidation, granting ample opportunity to top up collateral and minimize downside risk.
Aave
Aave needs no introduction to DeFi users, having established itself as a mainstay of the $36B DeFi lending industry. $20B of that total is accounted for by Aave alone, whose multi-chain reach, robust security, and user-friendly interface have made it a favorite for everyone from minnows to whales. More than 160,000 native token-holders can participate in onchain governance, meaning Aave can also claim to be one of the most decentralized lending protocols on the market.
With eight networks supported, Aave provides familiarity, giving users confidence that they can rely on its battle-tested protocol on whichever chain they choose to ply their trade. There are multiple ways to earn an APY as an Aave user. You can deposit assets and earn interest on the borrowing of others; you can deposit your own assets and borrow a secondary asset, taking advantage of competitive interest rates; or you can stake AAVE and earn rewards for helping to secure the protocol.
Kamino
Solana is the largest non-EVM chain for DeFi and memecoin trading and it naturally has its own protocols where lending is available. Chief among these is Kamino, which allows native Solana assets including USDC, SOL, and JUP to be deposited or borrowed. The APYs are attractive too, providing ample incentives for those with spare crypto to park to earn a passive double-digit return.
One of the best things about Kamino is the range of assets it supports. In addition to Solana “blue chips,” it allows popular memecoins such as WIF and BONK to be used as collateral. This allows Solana users to reap the rewards of memecoin season while also borrowing assets that can be used for other purposes such as liquidity mining – or simply to buy more memecoins.
Compound
Compound is one of the oldest and most trusted DeFi lending protocols. Around $2.5B is deposited into its decentralized protocol at present and used to borrow approximately $900M in assets. A number of EVM chains are supported including Polygon, Optimism, Base, Arbitrum, and of course Ethereum. ETH and USDC can be borrowed and the borrowing APRs are attractive.
One of the best things about Compound is that it’s been integrated into numerous third-party platforms including OKX, Binance, and Crypto.com. As a result, users of centralized crypto services can reap the rewards to be had from Compound’s efficient and highly secure crypto lending protocol. Governance is handled by COMP holders, who can propose and vote on protocol upgrades.
YouHodler
YouHodler is a centralized platform that intersects with DeFi, whose lending and borrowing formula has inspired its own service. Designed to promote the hodl mentality, YouHodler incentivizes users to avoid selling their crypto where possible and to instead borrow against it – a strategy that can prove profitable in a bull market. One of the most useful things about YouHodler is the sheer number of cryptos that can be borrowed against: anything in the top 50 by market cap is accepted.
There are other unique features to YouHodler too that make this CeDeFi platform worthy of consideration. Like its provision of a market-beating loan-to-value ratio value of 97%. Or the fact that borrowed assets can be converted to fiat and withdrawn to a bank account. If you don’t want to sell your crypto but have a house to buy or car to fix, YouHodler is a good choice.
If you’re keen to borrow against your long-term crypto assets, you should choose a trusted lending platform and maintain a healthy collateral ratio, which can help you to make your digital assets work for you.

River Protocol Takes on Slack, Discord With Messaging Apps on Ethereum L2 Base - Decrypt

With big tech companies like Google and Meta pumping potentially unwanted AI features into their messaging platforms, there is a growing call for decentralized and encrypted alternatives that don't rely on the centralized heavyweights.One company that aims to provide this service is Here Not There Labs, creator of the Towns social app and the newly launched River Protocol. River aims to offer an alternative to chat platforms like Slack and Discord, powered by blockchain tech and both customizable and private for creators.“You see a lot of social media products that are decentralized, but you don’t see a lot of social media protocols,” Here Not There Labs co-founder and CEO Ben Rubin told Decrypt. “I do not know of a social media [app] that is owned and operated by the participants of its network that have a means to create trust between one another in a way that is permissionless.”Created in 2023, River Protocol is designed to allow developers to build decentralized, real-time messaging applications using an Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) compatible layer-2 blockchain, off-chain nodes, and smart contracts on Ethereum scaling network Base.A screenshot from Towns, which is built on River Protocol. Image: Here Not There LabsAccording to the River Protocol website, the project is governed by the River Association, a decentralized autonomous organization or DAO, that allows RVR token holders to participate in the protocol’s future.River Protocol joins a growing number of decentralized applications offering secure communications and social media including Farcaster, BlueSky, Nostr, and Blockscan Chat. But while many social media protocols are aiming to take on Twitter, River Protocol is more focused on teams, companies, and projects who need their own dedicated server.“Each group is represented as a space, and each space is its own smart contract that is being deployed on-chain,” Rubin said. “What the smart contract does is allow the group to issue membership into the space, and also program the entitlement of who can read and write, and under what conditions."According to Rubin, this type of setup works best for large groups with specific roles assigned to members like moderators, or who need to set restricted access to channels in the group.River stores content off-chain and uses on-chain roll-ups. A bespoke appchain handles messaging to maintain speeds to provide a similar experience to Telegram or WhatsApp. This separation, Rubin added, ensures robust security for permissions while optimizing messaging to be fast and user-friendly—yet maintains user control and decentralization.“While our main deployment is on-chain, you can read on [Ethereum] mainnet, Polygon, or across any other chains to compose rules together,” Here Not There Labs co-founder and CTO Brian Meeks added. “All of that creates a trust route for the messaging, which is happening in the River protocol. But you can cryptographically verify that what is in the River protocol is what is allowed based on what's on-chain.”Other potential user cases for River Protocol besides messaging apps, Meeks added, include connecting players of decentralized video games.“Everything benefits from communication,” he said. “You can compose their protocol together into your game, into your app, or into whatever other decentralized experiences you have, and bring in a real-time provable, verifiable, end-to-end encrypted communication experience.”Additional reporting by Sander Lutz.Edited by Andrew HaywardDaily Debrief NewsletterStart every day with the top news stories right now, plus original features, a podcast, videos and more.

Ethereum Records Largest Daily Gains In 3 Years, Flips Mastercard And LVMH In Market Cap - Benzinga

On Monday afternoon, news broke that the probability of the SEC at least partially approving a spot ethereum ETF had vastly increased. This immediately led to massive buying activity for ETH, sending the price from less than $3,100 to over $3,800 in 24 hours. This marked the largest daily move for ETH since May 2021. Don't Miss:The move followed a post on X from Eric Balchunas, a Bloomberg ETF analyst, who has been covering crypto ETFs for several months. The post detailed how he is raising the "odds of spot Ether ETF approval to 75% (up from 25%), hearing chatter this afternoon that SEC could be doing a 180 on this (increasingly political issue), so now everyone scrambling (like us everyone else assumed they’d be denied)."The post has amassed nearly five million views at the time of writing and was one of the first to start the frenzy surrounding the spot ETH ETFs. The announcement was highly unforeseen, as many had written off the ETFs due to the SEC's lack of comment on the issue and final deadlines for a decision looming later this week. Trending: According to Cathie Wood, holding 6 Ethereum (ETH) could make you a millionaire, here’s why it can be true.This news further enabled ethereum to reach a market cap of over $450 billion, making it larger than all but 20 companies worldwide. Here are some of the companies that ethereum surpassed after the news:
Mastercard (MA)



LVMH (LVMUY)



Procter & Gamble (PG) 



Samsung (KRW)



Bank of America (BOA)
However, approval of ETFs is not as black and white as a simple "yes" or "no" from the SEC because two forms must be approved for the ETFs to go live. The 19b-4 form allows the funds to list the ETFs, while the S-1 form is a detailed account of how the ETFs would work. According to ETF analyst Nate Geraci, the SEC could greenlight the 19b-4 forms but delay a decision on the S-1s. This would give them time to take a closer look at the individual applications from different sponsors to understand what a launch would look like. If this were to happen, it would be a positive for the spot ETFs and ethereum. It would allow the applications to move into the next stage of the process and one step closer to launch. Additionally, the possibility of full approval of the 19b-4s and S-1s is still on the table.Many crypto enthusiasts believe that a spot ETF approval would propel ETH to a price above $4,000, with some predicting that ETH could set new ATHs above $4,900. Given that Bitcoin hit new highs after the approval of its ETFs, a similar trend could occur for ethereum. Read Next:

The meme cryptocurrency SNEK, one of the largest assets on the Cardano blockchain, has seen a significant surge this week, adding over 20% to its value. The price of SNEK, known for its snake mascot, rose from 0.00227 ADA to 0.00277 ADA since Monday. This price increase has pushed SNEK's market capitalization to 203.74 million ADA, equivalent to $97.56 million. Currently, the token ranks as the third largest asset in the Cardano ecosystem, trailing only behind WorldMobile (WMT) and SingularityNET (AGIX).SNEK promotes itself as "the chillest meme coin on Cardano," with a mission of fostering community growth, advancing decentralized finance within the Cardano network and rewarding its holders. In recent years, SNEK has garnered significant support from the Cardano community. This support underscores the coin's popularity, even catching the attention of Charles Hoskinson. SNEK price outlookHowever, despite its growing popularity and substantial market cap, SNEK has yet to be listed on major exchanges like Binance or OKX. The absence of listings on these major exchanges may be seen as an unrealized trigger for the price. Source: TapToolsThe recent price surge appears to be fueled by the broader meme coin mania sweeping the cryptocurrency market. As meme cryptocurrencies inspired by various animals have seen triple-digit growth, SNEK has stealthily made its presence felt, suggesting that its rise may be just beginning.The SNEK price chart indicates a pattern of increasingly higher lows, hinting at a bullish trend as it approaches a key resistance level against ADA. If current market sentiment continues, it could drive more Cardano token holders to invest in SNEK, potentially amplifying its recent 21.6% rise.

Spot Bitcoin ETF (BTC) Holdings Hit New High of 850K

The spot ETFs ended Wednesday with their eighth straight day of net inflows, gobbling over 24,500 BTC over that period. This is a nearly 180-degree turn from the action of the past few weeks – with some of the biggest ETFs seeing zero inflows and even net outflows on some days.

Pepe Memecoin Soars 27% Amid Speculation of Spot Ether ETF Approval



                    

Ethereum-based memecoin Pepe surged 27% to a new all-time high over the past 24 hours, fueled by speculation surrounding the potential approval of spot Ether exchange-traded funds (ETFs) in the United States.



“PEPE is probably the best memecoin play for the ETH ETF,” crypto trader Matthew Hyland claimed in a May 21 X post.




Pseudonymous crypto trader “Kaleo” noted the irony in how ETH is moving, and PEPE has become one of the most obvious hindsight trades out there.



Ether has risen 23.28% over the past two days, reaching $3,785, amid renewed hope that the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) may approve spot Ether ETFs by a May 23 deadline. 



This unexpected development has caught analysts and the crypto industry by surprise.




Pepe (PEPE) is currently trading at $0.00001387, up 23.48% over the past 24 hours, according to CoinMarketCap data.



Pseudonymous crypto trader “Plazma” believes PEPE’s upward trend will continue but anticipates brief periods of volatility.

“PEPE price discovery should continue for the next few weeks with some normal breaks for a few days and the usual pullbacks. 




“We will be at 2x-3x in just a few weeks,” they wrote in a May 21 X post.



Meanwhile, PEPE’s open interest (OI) — the total value of all outstanding PEPE futures contracts across crypto exchanges — increased 40% to $172.96 million over the past 24 hours, according to CoinGlass data.



An OI rise typically indicates traders are more confident in entering future positions on a cryptocurrency, with data showing a significant number in long positions.



If PEPE’s price drops 6%, it would liquidate $10 million in long positions.



PEPE led price growth among the top 10 memecoins by market capitalization over the past 24 hours, but other top memecoins also saw significant price increases over the past week.



Bonk (BONK) rose 40.80%, Floki (FLOKI) increased 21.94%, and Book of Memes (BOME) climbed 25.04%.
