QuadrigaCX Co-Founder Targeted Over Source of Funds


Authorities from British Columbia, Canada's westernmost province, are going after Michael Patryn, a co-founder of the failed QuadrigaCX cryptocurrency exchange, according to a report by the Vancouver Sun.  B.C. has filed an unexplained wealth order in order to compel Patryn to reveal the source of his allegedly corrupt assets. This is an attempt to seize and dispose of the wealth that was acquired unlawfully. The province introduced unexplained wealth orders last year in order to fight against money laundering. Such orders also exist in the UK, New Zealand, and Ireland. The authorities allege that Patryn's cash, gold bars, expensive watches, and jewelry are related to the QuadrigaCX scam. Prior to that, Patryn denied these allegations.  As reported by U.Today, QuadrigaCX CEO Gerald Cotton died from Crohn's disease in India in late 2018, taking the password to the exchange's cold wallets with $190 million worth of crypto to his grave. It later turned out that Cotton was running a scam, with accounting firm Ernst & Young revealing that he was actually transferring funds from customer accounts to other trading platforms in order to enrich himself. There were some conspiracy theories about whether or not Cotton actually died: the Rajasthan state is known for issuing fake death certificates. The mysterious death of the Canadian crypto king even inspired Netflix to release a true crime documentary about the QuadrigaCX case. In late 2022, a mysterious transfer of 100 Bitcoins from the exchange's cold wallet puzzled the community. Last year, EY announced that it would start interim distribution to some QuadrigaCX customers.

                        The UK’s Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) on Tuesday issued new guidelines for financial services promotions on social media. These apply to formats like memes, reels, and gaming streams, highlighting the need for fairness and avoiding any misleading information.In a press release, the regulator said that companies are responsible for all their promotional content, including that created by influencers.Promoting a financial product without the requisite authorization from a duly qualified FCA-authorized person constitutes a potential criminal offense, it warned.“Consumers need to be alert to dubious adverts and scams online, but it is important that influencers ensure they’re on the right side of the rules and consider what would happen to their own reputations if they’re found to promote products illegally,” the watchdog said.FCA Removed Misleading Advertisements in 2023
“Promotions aren’t just about the likes, they’re about the law,” said Lucy Castledine, director of consumer investments at the FCA. “We will take action against those touting financial products illegally.”The financial regulator has intensified its oversight of financial promotions. Last year, it removed a higher number of misleading advertisements compared to 2022.This increased scrutiny follows the implementation of stricter rules for advertising high-risk investments, including crypto. In July 2023, the FCA issued specific guidelines on how companies must disclose information about crypto-related products across various online platforms.FCA’s Agenda for Market Integrity and Consumer Protection
The regulations extend to crypto businesses operating internationally, provided their advertising reaches UK residents. Non-compliance can lead to severe penalties, including imprisonment for up to two years and potentially unlimited fines.Further, the FCA recently outlined plans to strengthen its ability to identify and address crypto market abuse over the next year. Its business plan prioritizes consumer protection and market integrity. It also aims to foster international competitiveness within the financial sector.This initiative comes as the UK establishes itself as a major player in the global crypto space. FCA research indicates a doubling of digital asset ownership within the country between 2021 and 2022.The watchdog has faced challenges in enforcing its crypto advertising regulations. Despite issuing guidance and removing a significant number of non-compliant ads (450 alerts issued in 2023 alone), it acknowledged persistent violations by some in the industry.Still, it remains committed to upholding regulatory compliance will continue taking action against those who breach the rules.

$ETH: BlackRock's Ethereum-Powered Money Market Fund Attracts Over $240M in Just One Week | Cryptoglobe


                                
According to Bloomberg, BlackRock’s USD Institutional Digital Liquidity Fund (BUIDL), which was launched on March 20, has seen an influx of over $240 million. This tokenized fund, issued on the Ethereum blockchain, offers investments in cash, US Treasury bills, and repurchase agreements, issuing a cryptocurrency token, BUIDL, valued at $1 per token to represent share ownership.



BlackRock enables token holders to transfer BUIDL within digital wallets approved by Securitize, its partner for this venture. This move is in line with BlackRock Chairman and CEO Larry Fink’s vision of a future where all financial assets are tokenized.



Carlos Domingo, the CEO of Securitize, outlined to Bloomberg three primary use cases for the tokenized fund. It targets crypto companies managing treasuries on blockchains, including decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs), supports crypto projects in developing derivatives of Treasury bills, and offers an alternative to stablecoins for use as collateral in borrowing and trading. Domingo emphasizes the institutional nature of the fund, managed by the world’s largest asset manager, BlackRock, highlighting its security and absence of counterparty risk for crypto companies.







            
            

            
            

            
            

        

Bloomberg reports that crypto startup Ondo Finance has made a significant investment in BlackRock’s BUIDL, totaling $95 million. This places BlackRock’s fund in a growing field of tokenized money-market funds, which started with Franklin Templeton’s launch of the first US-registered tokenized fund in 2021. Unlike Franklin Templeton’s fund tokens, BENJI, which are not transferable between investors, BlackRock’s BUIDL tokens can be transferred between validated addresses, thanks to Securitize Markets’ regulatory compliance with the SEC and FINRA.



The use of the Ethereum network for the BlackRock fund comes at a time when the SEC has heightened its examination of Ether. Despite this scrutiny, Domingo separates the regulatory investigations from the blockchain infrastructure itself, praising Ethereum’s reliability and suitability for the fund’s operations.

Top Analyst Says Blue Chip Ethereum Rival Eyeing Fresh 2024 Highs, Updates Outlook on Bitcoin and Dogecoin - The Daily Hodl


								A widely followed analyst and trader is offering his prediction on three crypto assets amid a slight bump in the markets.
Starting with the layer-one blockchain Near Protocol (NEAR), the analyst pseudonymously known as Bluntz tells his 251,200 subscribers on the social media platform X that the Ethereum (ETH) rival could rise above $9.01, the 22-month high last reached a little over a week ago.










“Will NEAR be the first Layer-1 in the top-50 (by market cap) back to fresh 2024 highs? I think the answer to that will be a resounding yes.”
According to the analyst who regularly uses the Elliott Wave theory in his technical analysis, two five-wave patterns are playing out on the four-hour chart of NEAR. The Elliott Wave theory states that the main trend of the price of an asset moves in a five-wave pattern while a correction occurs in a three-wave pattern.
Based on Bluntz’s chart, one of the five-wave patterns could complete at above the $8.80 price while the second one could complete at around the $9.53 level.
Source: Bluntz/X
NEAR is trading at $7.84 at time of writing.
Next up is Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum. Bluntz says that it is “looking” like the two largest crypto assets by market cap have formed price floors and are now destined to “start pushing higher again from here.”
Based on Bluntz’s charts, it appears that both Bitcoin and Ethereum have completed a three-wave corrective pattern to the downside on the 15-minute and one-hour timeframes, respectively.

Bitcoin is trading at $71,163 at time of writing while Ethereum is changing hands at $3,645.
Turning to Dogecoin (DOGE), Bluntz says that the largest memecoin by market cap has completed a three-wave corrective pattern on the 30-minute chart, suggesting the potential end of a downtrend.
“Starting to think it might not give deeper pullback, definitely strong, no doubt about that.”

DOGE is trading at $0.189 at time of writing.

                        Canadian authorities have filed a third “unexplained wealth order” application with the British Columbia Supreme Court targeting the co-founder of QuadrigaCX Michael Patryn to explain how assets were acquired.QuadrigaCX filed for bankruptcy in Canada in 2018 after its CEO, Gerald Cotten, died under mysterious circumstances in India, taking the only known private keys to the exchange’s wallets with him. Although some of the funds owed to the exchange’s customers have been paid back, large amounts are still missing.This latest unexplained wealth order application allows the Canadian authorities to take over assets linked to QuadrigaCX case.“Today, we have filed our third unexplained wealth order application with the British Columbia Supreme Court – a strong demonstration of our government’s commitment to take decisive action against criminals and organized crime,” said Mike Farnworth, Minister of Public Safety and Solicitor General for British Columbia, in a statement.The QuadrigaCX case has been much publicized in recent years, and was the subject of a popular 2022 Netflix documentary.Cash, Gold Bars, Rolex Watches Seized
The order will allow the forfeiture of $250,200 in cash, 45 gold bars, four luxury watches and a number of pieces of expensive jewelry contained in a safety deposit box belonging to QuadrigaCX co-founder Patryn.“The international, criminal actions of Quadriga Coin Exchange (QuadrigaCX) led to thousands of people losing their life savings,” said Farnworth.“While the fallout of cryptocurrency theft that leaves many victims in its wake is topical, what is even more timely is the recovery of these ill-gotten funds and converting them to community benefits in a public way,” said Farnworth.Proceeds From Crime Redirected to Victims
The Canadian official went on to stress that authorities will continue to take the assets from unlawful activity and redirect those proceeds made from crime to much-needed victim services programs and crime prevention initiatives, such as the anti-hate grants to communities announced on Feb. 15, 2024.“Gold bars may be highly liquid and flashy luxury goods, such as jewelry and Rolex watches, attract attention, but they are also attracting the attention of police and our government. If they are the proceeds of criminal activity like fraud, drug trafficking or money laundering, we will go after them,” said Farnworth.

Dogecoin Dev Breaks Silence on DOGE Payments in X


A prominent developer within the Dogecoin community, known by the pseudonym "Mishaboar," has sparked discussions regarding the potential integration of Dogecoin and crypto payments into X (formerly Twitter). Since Elon Musk's acquisition of the social media platform in October 2022, speculations have swirled around the incorporation of DOGE into X's payment system.Despite hints from Musk and other indicators, such as X Payments obtaining licenses for money transmitter activities in various U.S. states, the implementation of Dogecoin payments is pending.In a recent public statement, Mishaboar highlighted the ongoing debate surrounding X's payment infrastructure. Referring to Elon Musk's previous remarks, Mishaboar speculated on the possibility of crypto payments being introduced in subsequent phases of X Payments. However, the exact timeline and mechanism of integration remain uncertain, with Mishaboar suggesting potential collaborations with exchanges or brokerage platforms. The discussion expanded as other DOGE enthusiasts joined in, sharing their perspectives on the matter. Some expressed cautious optimism, emphasizing the likelihood of a gradual rollout of crypto payments, while others anticipated a longer time frame, estimating up to five years for full implementation.Operational reachMeanwhile, recent regulatory developments have seen X Payments achieve significant milestones, acquiring licenses for money transmitter activities in three additional U.S. states: Illinois, New Mexico and Oregon. This expansion enhances X Payments' operational reach, complementing existing licenses held in 19 other states.As Dogecoin continues to capture the attention of both seasoned investors and crypto enthusiasts, its potential integration into platforms like X could herald a new era of mainstream acceptance for cryptocurrencies.

Why Is Bitcoin Cash (BCH) Rising With Positive Decoupling From The Market? - Bitcoin Sistemi


Bitcoin Cash (BCH) increased by 13% ahead of the halving event expected to take place on April 4. Blockchain followers note that this event has historically preceded price increases.
Is Bitcoin Cash (BCH) Pricing Its Halving?
The current block reward for BCH is 6.25 BCH, but it will be reduced to 3,125 BCH after the halving. This decrease in the rate at which new coins are produced is expected to reduce available supply and potentially push prices up.


Open interest in BCH tracking futures also increased, indicating increased interest in leveraged bets on expected price volatility. This suggests that investors are preparing for potentially significant market movements in the near future.

Bitcoin Cash is a cryptocurrency resulting from a fork of Bitcoin. For this reason, it enters a halving process, just like Bitcoin. This situation triggers an increase in the price of BCH.





Additionally, there are 24 days left until Bitcoin's halving event. The halving is expected to occur approximately on April 24.
On the broader cryptocurrency market, however, the Bitcoin price has remained relatively stable over the past 24 hours, hovering around $70,000 after a volatile week.


Looking ahead, some investors are warning of a possible market-wide pullback if Bitcoin fails to sustain the $69,000 level in the coming days.

Is BlackRock's IBIT ETF the Fastest-Growing in History?


							

IBIT became the fastest-growing ETF, amassing $13.5B in just 11 weeks.



Larry Fink is bullish on Bitcoin as IBIT holds $17.1B in BTC.



Spot Bitcoin ETF market grows, exceeding $34.1B across nine issuers.




BlackRock CEO Larry Fink recently revealed his optimism regarding Bitcoin’s future while paying tribute to the success of the firm’s spot Bitcoin ETF, IBIT. Launched lately, IBIT has received impressive attention, becoming the fastest-growing ETF in the industry’s history, as claimed in a March 27 interview with Fox Business.







Under Fink’s leadership, BlackRock’s involvement in the crypto world with the iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) has exceeded all expectations, attracting $13.5 billion in just 11 weeks of trade. This success story marks a new chapter for the investment firm, with Fink acknowledging the unexpected high demand from retail investors. Larry Fink said:




 “IBIT is the fastest growing ETF in the history of ETFs. Nothing has gained assets as fast as IBIT in the history of ETFs.”




The ETF’s daily inflow average stands at over $260 million, with a peak single-day inflow of $849 million on March 12, data from Farside Investors reveals. Moreover, the surge in interest and investment has propelled IBIT to hold $17.1 billion in Bitcoin, a feat achieved in record time compared to traditional investment vehicles like the first gold ETF. 







Such rapid accumulation highlights the growing acceptance and interest in cryptocurrencies as a viable investment option. With this achievement, IBIT only trails behind the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust, which remains the largest holder of Bitcoin with $23.6 billion in assets.The broader market for spot Bitcoin ETFs has also seen significant growth, with total holdings exceeding $34.1 billion across nine issuers, excluding Grayscale. Among these, IBIT, along with the Fidelity Wise Origin Bitcoin Fund (FBTC) and ARK 21Shares Bitcoin ETF (ARKB), leads the pack in attracting inflows, showcasing the burgeoning interest in digital assets among investors.

Elon Musk offers free premium features on X, crypto scammers included

Elon Musk will no longer charge influential accounts on X for certain premium features as long as they meet certain conditions. However, those conditions also appear achievable for accounts involved in cryptocurrency scams.On March 28, Musk announced that accounts with 2,500 verified subscribers as followers will no longer need to pay for “Premium” features on X. Additionally, accounts with over 5,000 followers will get free access to “Premium+.”Source: Elon MuskX offers paid subscriptions for three tiers of premium services — Basic, Premium and Premium+ — incrementally unlocking more features for content creators within the X platforms. However, the ability to purchase verification on Twitter allows scammers and bad actors to easily impersonate influential people and dupe their followers into various scams.Elon Musk rolled out the paid verification model on X, earlier known as “Twitter Blue,” to fight scammers and spammers thriving on the platform before his takeover. Regardless, the crypto community argues that the X Premium features continue to aid scammers in reaching potential victims more effectively. While some community members appreciated Musk’s decision not to charge popular account verification fees, skeptics pointed out possible loopholes, given the lack of information about the platform’s internal mechanism to ensure eligibility. Prominent game developer Tyler Glaiel argued:“Haha so a bot farm can buy 2500 accounts and then use those to verify infinite accounts (or have them all follow each other and then stop paying?)”Few users — while acknowledging the costs involved — echoed Glaiel’s sentiment in speculating that the new feature could incentivize large groups of scammers to join hands and repurpose accounts for different types of cyberattacks.Some smaller accounts on X believe that Musk’s recent move incentivizes the “rich,” while others urged fellow verified users to play the system by following each other in order to claim free premium services. Related: X launches dedicated payments account, crypto community speculatesX is well aware of the concerns around verified scam accounts as, earlier in January 2024, the platform scaled back pricing for verified organizations on the social media platform. The move was aimed at countering numerous “gold check” accounts dedicated to pushing crypto scams.Source: VerifiedA recent CloudSEK report highlighted that “malicious campaigns are brooding on a large scale that requires a Twitter Gold account,” targeting X users with job and crypto scams. However, many speculated the price drop may have been an attempt to gain more paid subscribers. Magazine: ‘SEAL 911’ team of white hats formed to fight crypto hacks in real time

FTX Fallout: Victims' Stories Pile Up As Sam Bankman-Fried Faces Judge


								The upcoming sentencing of Sam Bankman-Fried, founder of the now-bankrupt FTX cryptocurrency exchange, is taking on a new dimension as the emotional and financial wreckage left behind by the company’s collapse comes to light.

The US Department of Justice submitted 52 victim impact statements to the court, painting a grim picture of lives upended and dreams shattered. A former member of the FTX Unsecured Creditors Committee detailed the loss of his entire $4 million life savings, forcing him out of work and into a deep depression. The incident, according to his statement, even strained his marriage.
FTX Victims Reveal Their Miseries


For an Italian woman, the collapse of the crypto exchange was a brutal double blow. Having previously lost funds in another crypto platform, Celsius Network, she saw FTX as a safe haven. However, the exchange’s demise triggered severe mental trauma, further impacting her marriage.
Another victim recounted how he poured his savings into FTX, lured by the exchange’s high-profile advertising and the promise of a future business venture. Now, with FTX gone, those dreams have vanished.
These are just a few of the harrowing stories emerging, each highlighting the human cost of the FTX debacle.
Beyond the financial losses, the statements reveal a deep sense of betrayal. Victims trusted the company, a seemingly established exchange, only to have their faith shattered.

Total crypto market cap at $2.5 trillion on the daily chart: TradingView.com
Many argue that the current legal proceedings fail to adequately address their needs. One victim, for instance, stressed the importance of valuing lost assets based on their current market value, not just their worth at the time of FTX’s bankruptcy filing.
There’s a glimmer of hope, however. The recent sale of FTX’s shares in artificial intelligence firm Anthropic for $884 million could provide a source of funds for potential reimbursement. However, the path to full compensation for victims remains unclear, and the legal complexities of asset valuation and distribution are sure to present significant challenges.
DOJ Recommends 50 Years For SBF
This human cost of the FTX collapse serves as a stark reminder of the risks associated with cryptocurrency investments. While the potential for high returns exists, the lack of robust regulations can leave investors vulnerable. The FTX saga underscores the urgent need for increased oversight and investor protection in the evolving world of digital assets.

The DOJ’s sentencing memorandum recommends a prison term of 40 to 50 years for Bankman-Fried, who was convicted of seven fraud and conspiracy charges in November.
 Bankman-Fried’s defense team, on the other hand, is advocating for a lighter sentence of no more than 6.5 years. The sentencing is scheduled for 9:30 a.m. ET on March 28, as Judge Lewis Kaplan nears a decision on the case.
Meanwhile, victims look to Kaplan to consider their emotional and financial hardships when sentencing the former FTX big boss, Sam Bankman-Fried. They also hope their stories will push the Federal Court towards a more victim-centric approach to compensation.
Whether justice can truly be served for those whose lives have been irrevocably altered by the FTX collapse remains to be seen.

Bitcoin ETF Inflows Could Eclipse $1 Trillion, Predicts Bitwise CIO


                            Following a week of net outflows, the spot Bitcoin ETF market has rebounded with impressive net inflows this week, highlighting a growing investor confidence in Bitcoin and its associated financial products. This week’s market activities have shown a remarkable reversal from the previous 5-day net outflow streak, with Tuesday witnessing a substantial net inflow of $480 million, followed by $243.5 million on Wednesday.
Yesterday’s resurgence in investor interest was notably boosted by Blackrock’s massive inflow of $323.8 million, effectively offsetting Grayscale GBTC’s $299.8 million outflows. Moreover, Ark Invest’s ARKB reported its best day yet, with $200 million in inflows, despite Fidelity experiencing its worst day with a mere $1.5 million in outflows. Nevertheless, Fidelity managed to bounce back with significant inflows of $261 million and $279 million on Monday and Tuesday, respectively.


1% Down, 99% To Go For Bitcoin ETFs
However, according to Bitwise Chief Investment Officer (CIO) Matt Hougan, this is just the mere beginning of what is to come in the upcoming months. Hougan’s commentary, part of his weekly memo to investment professionals, sheds light on the current market dynamics and the colossal potential that lies ahead. “1% Down; 99% to Go,” Hougan wrote, highlighting the nascent yet promising journey of Bitcoin ETFs.

Lately, the market has been characterized by its volatility, with Bitcoin’s price oscillating between $60,000 and $70,000. Hougan advises a calm and long-term perspective amidst this fluctuation, especially as the sector anticipates the upcoming Bitcoin halving around April 20, the approval of Bitcoin ETFs on national account platforms, and the soon-to-come completion of due diligence by various investment committees.
Despite the current sideways movement of Bitcoin’s price, Hougan remains bullish about its long-term trajectory. “Bitcoin is in a raging bull market,” he asserts, noting a nearly 300% increase over the past 15 months. The launch of spot Bitcoin ETFs in January has marked a significant milestone, opening up the Bitcoin market to investment professionals on an unprecedented scale.
Hougan’s analysis points to a profound shift as global wealth managers, who collectively control over $100 trillion, begin to explore investments in the “digital gold.” He suggests that even a conservative allocation of 1% of their portfolios to Bitcoin could result in approximately $1 trillion of inflows into the space.

This perspective is backed by historical data showing that even a 2.5% allocation to Bitcoin has enhanced the risk-adjusted returns of traditional 60/40 portfolios in every three-year period of Bitcoin’s history.
The recent inflows into Bitcoin ETFs, though impressive, are seen by Hougan as merely the beginning of a much larger movement. “We are all excited about the $12 billion that has flowed into ETFs since January. And it is exciting: Collectively, the most successful ETF launch of all time..But imagine global wealth managers allocate just 1% of their portfolios to bitcoin on average,” Hougan elaborates, emphasizing the scale of potential growth awaiting the cryptocurrency market. He concludes:
Think about the implications. […] A 1% allocation across the board would mean ~$1 trillion of inflows into the space. Against this, $12 billion is barely a down payment. 1% down, 99% to go.

Interoperability Protocol LayerZero Soars to $3B Valuation


							

LayerZero achieved a valuation of $3 billion, following growing interest from prominent venture capital firms.



Anticipation is mounting around LayerZero’s token airdrop, expected to occur soon.



World Economic Forum praised the protocol’s technology and models.




Omnichain interoperability protocol LayerZero has garnered significant attention from prominent investors, resulting in a valuation of $3 billion. With anticipation building around its upcoming yet-to-be-launched token airdrop, the growing interest solidifies the protocol’s impact.



LayerZero is reportedly designed to seamlessly connect blockchains while ensuring smooth cross-chain transactions with its models. Moreover, LayerZero’s ZRO airdrop is expected to occur soon, fueling investors’ interest in the token.



According to reports, several projects are built on or utilizing LayerZero’s technology, including the bridging platform Stargate, the RWA gaming asset tokenization protocol MetaZero, the decentralized lending and borrowing protocol Radiant Capital, and the decentralized exchange Trader Joe.









It is widely believed that interaction with LayerZero integrated platforms and protocols could provide traders and investors with a strategic advantage in terms of the increased likelihood of receiving the ZRO airdrop.



Additionally, reports added that the omnichain interoperability protocol is backed by prominent venture capital firms such as a167, Sequoia, and Coinbase Ventures. These partnerships led LayerZero’s $120 million raise to reach a $3 billion valuation.



Another reported method to keep an eye on the ZRO airdrop is by monitoring the protocol’s Discord activity. LayerZero’s Discord channel serves as a means of interaction with the community and its members, providing answers to questions and assistance.



The World Economic Forum (WEF) highlighted LayerZero’s technology, stating that the protocol “standardizes how information is passed across any blockchain.” Moreover, the WEF added that LayerZero has facilitated the movement of $50 billion in value and accounted for 97% of cross-chain message volume.

Ethereum reaches 1M validators, community thinks it’s ‘too much’

The Ethereum network recently hit the one million validator milestone, with 32 million Ether (ETH) currently staked, valued at approximately $114 billion based on current market prices.On March 28, the Dune Analytics dashboard created by Hildobby to track Ethereum staking progress showed that the network achieved a validator count of one million, with the 32 million ETH staked accounting for 26% of the total supply.The data also showed that around 30% of the ETH is staked using the Ethereum staking pool Lido, a liquid staking platform for proof-of-stake (PoS) cryptocurrencies. Staking pools like Lido remain popular because they allow users with a smaller amount of ETH to pool their assets and participate.Ethereum reaches one million validators. Source: DuneValidators ensure the security of a blockchain by monitoring the network for any malicious transactions, such as double-spending, which is essentially spending the same currencies twice. In Ethereum, validators participate in proposing and validating transactions within the network. Those who wish to participate in this process are required to stake 32 ETH. In return, they get a small portion of ETH as a reward. While the number of validators could translate into higher security for a blockchain, some community members think too many validators could pose a problem. Source: Gabriel WeideVenture investor and Ethereum advocate Evan Van Ness said there’s arguably already “too much” staked. Gabriel Weide, who runs a staking pool, believes that too many validators can eventually lead to “failed transactions.” Meanwhile, Peter Kim, the head of engineering at Coinbase Wallet, said that while the number of validators is “impressive,” it’s “artificially inflated by the 32 ETH cap.” However, he suggested this may change soon. Related: Vitalik Buterin on fix for Ethereum centralization: Make running nodes easierAs the number of validators continues to rise, Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin proposed a way to improve the network’s decentralization. On March 27, Buterin published a blog post proposing to penalize validators in proportion to their average failure rate.If many validators fail in a given slot, each failure’s penalties will be higher. Such an approach could potentially reduce the advantage of large ETH stakers over smaller ones, according to Buterin. Magazine: ETH a security?

                        Bitcoin Price PredictionAmid fluctuating markets, Bitcoin dips below $70,000, spotlighting debates on its future price. U.S. and U.K. sanctions against Gaza Now’s crypto operations underscore ongoing regulatory scrutiny, possibly influencing Bitcoin’s trajectory. Meanwhile, BlackRock’s bullish stance and the success of its Bitcoin ETF highlight growing institutional interest. Casa’s new inheritance solution for Bitcoin ensures secure asset transfers, enhancing trust in cryptocurrency as a long-term investment amidst evolving regulatory and market landscapes. Let’s take a look at intraday Bitcoin price prediction. The US and UK Sanction Crypto Addresses Linked to Gaza Group







The United States and the United Kingdom have imposed sanctions on crypto addresses associated with ‘Hamas-aligned’ Gaza Now and its founder, Mustafa Ayash. These measures come in response to Hamas’ fundraising activities following the October 7 incident in Israel.
Despite Gaza Now’s effort to raise funds through cryptocurrency, contributions remained low, with only $21,000 received post-attack.
Data from Elliptic and TRM Labs indicates that most crypto donations to such groups are under $500.















While these developments spotlight concerns over the use of digital currencies for terrorist financing, they’re unlikely to directly affect Bitcoin prices.
However, they could lead to heightened regulatory scrutiny and demands for tighter controls on crypto transactions, potentially impacting investor sentiment and broader crypto adoption.
Key Points:

US and UK sanction crypto addresses linked to Gaza Now and Mustafa Ayash.
Following the October 7 incident, only $21,000 in crypto donations were received.
Increased regulatory attention on crypto transactions may affect investor sentiment.








BlackRock’s Bitcoin ETF Surges to $17 Billion under CEO’s Bullish Outlook
Larry Fink, the CEO of BlackRock, expressed a “very bullish” stance on Bitcoin, coinciding with the firm’s spot Bitcoin ETF, the iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT), amassing over $17 billion in assets.Highlighting its rapid success, IBIT garnered $13.5 billion within just 11 weeks, surpassing Fink’s expectations and underscoring significant retail interest.This growth not only contributes to a more liquid Bitcoin market but also solidifies IBIT’s position as a major player, second only to Grayscale in Bitcoin ETF holdings. The recent approval of Hashdex’s spot Bitcoin ETF further energizes the competitive sphere.Fink’s announcement is a positive indicator of growing institutional engagement in Bitcoin, potentially buoying BTC prices as more investors turn to regulated avenues for cryptocurrency investment.Key Takeaways:
BlackRock’s CEO Larry Fink is “very bullish” on Bitcoin, with the firm’s ETF crossing $17 billion.
The iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) quickly amassed $13.5 billion, highlighting strong retail demand.
Growing institutional interest and the competitive ETF market may positively impact BTC prices.

Bitcoin Price Prediction
Bitcoin (BTC/USD) exhibits a promising outlook, momentarily trading above the pivotal $68,558 mark, suggesting a bullish momentum. The cryptocurrency faces immediate resistance at $71,677, with subsequent thresholds at $73,383 and $75,692 potentially capping gains. Support levels at $66,844, $63,820, and $60,763 offer a safety net against downturns. Bitcoin Price PredictionThe Relative Strength Index (RSI) at 56 and a bullish engulfing candle on the 4-hour chart bolster the potential for upward movement, especially if Bitcoin sustains above the $68,500 benchmark. However, slipping below this critical level could precipitate a significant sell-off, marking a crucial juncture for Bitcoin’s near-term trajectory.Last Opportunity: Invest in Sponge V2 Before It Hits Exchanges – Secure 170% Staking Rewards!

21Shares launches staking ETP on TON

21Shares’ announcement to launch a TON-based staking ETP on the SIX Swiss Exchange has generated significant excitement within the crypto community and traditional investors. 
This move represents a significant step for the TON project, bringing it closer to the traditional market in a similar way to Bitcoin, while at the same time offering investors a new way to gain exposure to this emerging blockchain without the need to directly own the tokens.

21Shares launches staking ETP on TON
But what exactly does this new feature mean? To fully understand it, it is essential to understand what an ETP is. An Exchange Traded Product is essentially a financial security listed and traded on the traditional market, which aims to replicate the performance of a specific asset or group of assets. 
In the context of blockchain and cryptocurrencies, an ETP linked to TON offers investors the opportunity to invest in this blockchain without having to directly manage TON tokens.
This is a significant advantage for institutional and traditional investors who may be reluctant to dive directly into the world of cryptocurrencies due to the complexity and operational challenges associated.
Through the ETP staking of TON offered by 21Shares, these investors can gain exposure to the TON blockchain and benefit from its growth potential without having to deal with the challenges related to custody and direct token management.
Furthermore, the interest shown by 21Shares in TON underlines the growing acceptance and interest of financial institutions towards emerging blockchains and cryptocurrencies.
The fact that a major company like 21Shares is investing in TON through an ETP represents a significant vote of confidence in the vision and potential of this blockchain.
The challenges and uncertainties in the new vision of 21 shares
Despite the uncertainties and challenges that may accompany the adoption of new technologies and financial assets, the announcement by 21Shares marks an important step towards the integration of TON into the traditional financial landscape. 
This could lead to an increase in visibility and liquidity for TON, opening up new investment opportunities for a wide range of investors.
It is important to note that while the ETP of TON offered by 21Shares provides a new option for investors, it is essential to conduct diligent research and carefully evaluate the associated risks before investing. 
Cryptocurrencies and emerging blockchains may be subject to volatility and unique risks, and investors should be aware of such factors before making investment decisions.
Conclusions
In conclusion, the launch of the TON ETP staking by 21Shares marks a significant moment in the evolution of the cryptocurrency sector and in the convergence with the traditional market. 
This initiative offers investors a new and accessible way to gain exposure to TON, while highlighting the growing interest of financial institutions in emerging blockchains. 
The integration of TON within ETPs represents an important step towards greater adoption and acceptance of cryptocurrencies in the global financial landscape. 
However, it is essential that investors carefully examine the associated risks and conduct diligent research before making investment decisions. 
With further innovations and developments in the cryptocurrency sector, we expect to see new opportunities and challenges emerge, paving the way for greater integration and growth in both the traditional financial market and the world of cryptocurrencies.

Bitcoin: a whale from 2010 wakes up, but the price does not react

Yesterday something curious happened: the news came out that a whale moved a large amount of Bitcoins that had not moved since 2010, but when this news spread, the price of BTC did not react at all. 
Usually news like this spreads some apprehension in the market, but this time it has been completely ignored. This seems to show that the price of Bitcoin is once again going its own way at the moment, until the halving on April 20th. 

Bitcoin moved by the whale and the price reaction
The BTC were moved by the whale on Tuesday, and in total they were about 2,000. Nowadays they have a market value of about 140 million dollars, and are comparable to the amount of BTC liquidated daily by the Grayscale ETF in this period.
The fact is that those BTC have not moved since 2010, when they were mined between August and November of the same year. 
So someone who was mining Bitcoin at the time collected them and held them for 14 years, only to move them all at once yesterday.
It should be remembered that at the time Bitcoin had only been in existence for just over a year and a half, and its market value was on average less than $0.1. Overall, the 2,000 BTC moved yesterday were worth less than $200 at the time. 
Until November 2012, 50 BTC were awarded to anyone who managed to mine a block, and in fact anyone could do it using even a simple computer. To earn 2,000 BTC with mining you just needed to mine 40 blocks, and from August to November 2010 about 25,000 blocks were mined in total.
What is surprising, therefore, is not that the whale was able to accumulate 2,000 BTC in 2010, but that it has kept them for 14 years. 
The movements of the whale
It is not known who owns those BTC, but it is unlikely to be an exchange, since at that time there were very few exchanges with insignificant trading volumes. 
For example, it is enough to remember that it often happened that there were entire days without even one exchange. 
Instead, it is much more likely that he was a member of the cypherpunk community in which Bitcoin was already relatively widespread, and that he was simply accumulating BTC through mining, since at the time anyone could do it even with low-power machines. 
Moreover, it has been since 2020 that that whale moves Bitcoin collected in the early years, probably always thanks to mining.
Actually, in this March 2024 he has already made three big movements, one on March 1st, always of 2,000 BTC, and another on March 5th of 1,000 BTC. In total, he has moved 5,000 BTC only in the month of March, for a value in dollars of about 350 million.
Probably this is also why the news did not trigger sales on the current market, since these movements have been going on for some time now. 
Furthermore, it is not even known precisely what happens to those BTC once moved, because if they were sold on exchanges they could actually lower the price. 
Since this is not happening, it is presumed that they have not been moved to be sold, also because the number of Bitcoins present on the known wallets of exchanges has been decreasing in the last 30 days.
The price of Bitcoin
Yesterday, however, the price of Bitcoin recorded some movement, although not as a result of this news, and with a practically zero final balance. 
Before the opening of the US stock exchanges it was around $70,000. 
Just before their opening, it had quickly risen to over $71,500, anticipating the clearly positive opening of the US stock exchanges. 
However, as soon as the news spread that a US judge had rejected Coinbase‘s request to dismiss the SEC’s charges against the exchange, the price started to drop, reaching $68,300 a few hours later.
Once the trading session on the American stock exchanges was closed, the price of Bitcoin slowly returned to where it had started, namely $70,000, thus canceling out all the day’s losses. 
It has been lateralizing around $70,000 since Monday, without having the strength to rise above $72,000, nor the weakness to fall below $68,000. 
The rally that started in early February ended on March 14 with a new all-time high of $73,800, while the correction that started on the same day ended on Wednesday, March 20. From the same Wednesday until Sunday, it then rose back up to $70,000, and since then it has been trading sideways around this figure. 
The hypothesis circulating is that the current sideways movement could continue at least until the end of the month, while starting from next week it could return to move significantly.

The Cryptonomist

In this month of general crypto bull run, in the specific category of memecoins, it seems that FLOKI’s performance stands out compared to Dogecoin, Pepe, Shiba Inu, and Bonk. In fact, FLOKI’s price has increased by +360% in the last 30 days. 

FLOKI: its performance surpasses Dogecoin and other memecoins in this crypto bull run
FLOKI, the memecoin developed on Ethereum and also supported by Binance Smart Chain (BSC), seems to be registering the best price performance compared to Dogecoin and others in its category. 
And indeed, in the last 30 days of the crypto bull run, the price of FLOKI is up +360%, which includes the retracement that is occurring in the last week. 
Basically, at the time of writing FLOKI is worth $0.0002271, but this month it reached its maximum price of $0.000303 on March 14 and the minimum price of $0.0000429 on February 28. 
Her colleagues memecoins, on the other hand, seem to have ridden the wave of the general crypto bull run in a different way. 
Dogecoin (DOGE), the ultimate memecoin, with its total market cap of 28.91 billion dollars, has recorded a price pump of +111% in the last month. Following, the price of Shiba Inu (SHIB) up by +186%, PEPE by +190%, and BONK by +91%. 
The only memecoin to be at the same level as FLOKI seems to be dogwifhat (WIF) which, at the time of writing, is up +370% in price compared to a month ago. 
FLOKI: the top memecoin that surpasses Dogecoin and the others in this crypto bull run
Since the bull run period seems to not be over yet, there are analysts who, studying the specific category of memecoins, seem to look at FLOKI as the best. 

“According to several cryptocurrency analysts, $FLOKI will be the best #memecoin of this bull cycle. #$Floki has outperformed $DOGE, $PEPE, $SHIB, $WIF, and $BONK during the last memecoin run of this cycle.”
Actually, as already mentioned before, it seems that at the moment WIF is also dominating the memecoin scene. 
The ranking of the main memecoins sees DOGE in first place, followed by SHIB and PEPE remaining on the podium. Immediately after it’s time for WIF, then FLOKI and finally BONK.
The boom on Binance
To support the current top performance of FLOKI, it could have been its listing on the Binance crypto-exchange.
An entrance door that allowed FLOKI to see its trading volumes grow, especially for the FLOKI/USDT and FLOKI/TRY pairs. 
And indeed, at the beginning of March 2024, it was shown how 50% of FLOKI’s trading volumes were taking place on Binance.
It should be noted that the memecoin FLOKI is not as widespread as its other colleagues. In fact, on Kraken and Coinbase, FLOKI has not yet been listed.

Bitbot’s presale surpasses $1.5m
The Bitbot presale is in the seventh stage and has already raised more than $1.5m. The 7th stage will end once the amount raised reaches $1.63m. 
The project’s growing presale shows that investors are buying into Bitbot’s narrative and potential growth. Currently, the $BITBOT token is going for $0.0134 but is set to increase to $0.0141 once the eighth round commences.
The development team will hold 20% of the total token supply and will use it to fund ongoing development. 14% of the total token supply has already been allocated to marketing & CEX listings while 3% goes to exchange liquidity provision.

Could $BITBOT rally higher this year?
The crypto market has been bullish since the start of the year and many analysts expect BTC to surpasses $150k in the coming months. With the Bitcoin halving roughly 20 days away, trading volume in the market could significantly go higher.
Bitbot could be a big winner in the market if it rolls out its products. The project can leverage the growing trading volume in the market to obtain a sizable market share. If that happens, its native $BITBOT token could soar higher in the coming months and years.

                        Amazon has invested $4 billion in ChatGPT’s rival artificial intelligence (AI) startup Anthropic, solidifying its minority ownership in the company. In a recent announcement, the e-commerce and technology giant revealed that it has injected an additional $2.75 billion into Anthropic, following an initial investment of $1.25 billion made back in September.Anthropic, founded in 2021 by former members of OpenAI, has emerged as a notable competitor to ChatGPT with its own AI chatbot named Claude. The company recently unveiled Claude 3, its most advanced version capable of analyzing images alongside its chat capabilities.ChatGPT Rival Anthropic Chooses AWS as its Cloud Provider
As part of the investment deal, Amazon disclosed that Anthropic has chosen Amazon Web Services (AWS) as its primary cloud provider for critical workloads, including safety research and future model development. Anthropic will leverage AWS Trainium and Inferentia chips to construct, train, and deploy its upcoming models.“We have a notable history with Anthropic, together helping organizations of all sizes around the world to deploy advanced generative artificial intelligence applications across their organizations,” Swami Sivasubramanian, Vice President of Data and AI at AWS, said. He referred to generative AI as “the most transformational technology of our time.”In addition to its significant AI investments, Amazon recently launched its own AI-powered assistant, Amazon Q, tailored for businesses. Amazon Q boasts chatbot capabilities, problem-solving abilities, content creation, and more.While ChatGPT might be dominating the AI space in terms of popularity, Amazon’s investment in Anthropic is not the only one among tech giants eyeing the promising AI startup. In October of last year, Google announced a $500 million investment in Anthropic, with plans to increase it to $2 billion.However, like many prominent AI chatbot developers, Anthropic has faced legal disputes concerning copyright and data infringement. The company battled a lawsuit filed by music label Universal Music Group (UMG) in January. UMG accused Anthropic of “unlawful” use, copying, and dissemination of copyrighted works from their catalog during AI training.Three Major AI Blockchain Firms Merge
SingularityNET, Fetch.ai, and Ocean Protocol are planning a merger of their crypto tokens to establish a decentralized AI platform and foster collaboration among the three companies.The companies are exploring the creation of an ASI token, which would possess a fully diluted value of approximately $7.5 billion.While the merger plans are subject to approval from the respective communities, an official announcement could be expected as early as Wednesday. Under the proposed arrangement, SingularityNET, Fetch.ai, and Ocean Protocol would maintain their separate operations while working together under the guidance of a newly formed entity called the Superintelligence Collective. However, not everyone is optimistic about AI-related crypto tokens. In a recent research report, leading crypto exchange Coinbase said the surge in the AI token market may be driven more by hype than actual utility.The report suggested that the value potential of many AI tokens may be overstated due to the prevailing attention on the AI industry, and that these tokens may lack sustainable demand-side drivers in the short to medium term.

Hong Kong-based Asset Manager VSFG aiming for a May spot Bitcoin ETF launch



                    

                    
There are reports that the Hong Kong SFC is considering to approve Bitcoin ETFs in Q2 2024.
VSFG and Value Partners have applied for approval to offer a spot Bitcoin ETF in Hong Kong.
VSFG is targeting to launch the spot BTC ETF as early as May this year.

Hong Kong’s financial landscape is set for a potential transformation as Venture Smart Financial Holdings Ltd (VSFG), a prominent asset management company, gears up to launch a spot Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) in the country as early as May.
Collaborating with local firm Value Partners, VSFG has filed an application with the Hong Kong Securities and Futures Commission (SFC) to introduce this innovative investment product to the market.
Hong Kong’s stand on Bitcoin ETFs
Following regulatory considerations initiated in December 2023, Hong Kong regulators have been actively contemplating the approval of spot crypto ETFs within the region.
Earlier, Bloomberg Senior ETF Analyst Eric Balchunas in a post on X, citing a Bloomberg Intelligence report, stated that the SFC is considering allowing in-kind creations and redemptions for spot bitcoin ETFs in the second quarter of this year.
If true, the move will underscore Hong Kong’s growing reputation as a crypto-friendly hub where financial institutions can readily offer innovative products to local investors.
Industry leaders have echoed the sentiment, urging regulators to expedite the launch of spot ETFs in Hong Kong to meet the increasing demand from investors.
Bitcoin ETF boom and its impact
The approval of spot Bitcoin ETFs in the United States in January sparked a surge in offerings by major financial institutions such as Grayscale, BlackRock, and Fidelity Investments. Accumulating approximately $50 billion in assets within a few months, these ETFs have significantly boosted investor engagement in the crypto market.
Moreover, the approval of Bitcoin ETFs coincided with a substantial BTC price escalation, with its value skyrocketing from around $30,000 to as high as $73,700 in March. Currently trading at $70,630, Bitcoin’s value is poised for further growth, especially with the anticipated approval of spot ETFs in Hong Kong.
VSFG’s move to apply for a spot Bitcoin ETF aligns with the broader trend of financial institutions capitalizing on the growing interest in cryptocurrency investment products. If approved, the ETF would streamline the investment process for Hong Kong-based investors, providing them with a regulated and accessible avenue to gain exposure to Bitcoin.
With the potential launch of the spot Bitcoin ETF in May, VSFG aims to position itself at the forefront of Hong Kong’s evolving financial landscape, catering to the increasing demand for crypto investment opportunities in the region.

Mike Novogratz, the cofounder and chief executive officer (CEO) of Galaxy Digital, has shared another hot take on why he believes owing Bitcoin (BTC) as an asset class is essential.Debt spiral analogy and BitcoinAccording to Mike Novogratz, the state of the United States debt deficit is notably alarming. He said that what many do not want to hear is how the government needs to cut its spending drastically while levying heavy taxes on the wealthy class.He said any major loophole through which cash is reduced also needs to be covered. He said if these recommendations are done the right way, America may get to prevent slipping into a debt death spiral in the long term. He pointed out that the current government debt is pegged at about $34 trillion, a figure that grows every 100 days.If left unchecked, Mike Novogratz is convinced the debt may soar as high as $37 trillion without an end in sight. The financial guru noted that this debt challenge makes it easier to convince anyone to buy Bitcoin or other assets. Case for BitcoinBitcoin is considered a major hedge against currency devaluation and a store of value, accounting for why firms like MicroStrategy Incorporated have continued buying the cryptocurrency at every opportunity it gets.Rather than the U.S. Dollar, which is being printed indiscriminately, Bitcoin has a maximum supply of 21 million. This sum is emitted in bits, and the last Bitcoin will not be mined until 2140, owing to the provisions encoded in the BTC halving event. This makes the digital currency a very scarce commodity overall.Galaxy Digital and Invesco co-own a spot Bitcoin ETF, a product that also contributes to the scarcity of Bitcoin through intense, regular accumulations. In all, Mike Novogratz implied that, unlike the USD, which is being devalued, these fundamentals might help Bitcoin gain more traction this year and in the long run.

Should you ditch Dogecoin for ICP? Here's what the market is telling you - AMBCrypto



The values of ICP and DOGE have risen by double digits in the last week.
Both altcoins appear ready to extend their price rallies.

Internet Computer [ICP] outperformed Dogecoin [DOGE] last week, as its value climbed by over 50% during the seven-day period, according to CoinMarketCap. Leading memecoin DOGE managed only a 30% price uptick during that period.
The double-digit rally in the values of both altcoins mirrors the general market growth witnessed in the last week. According to CoinGecko’s data, the global cryptocurrency market capitalization increased by 4% during that period.
Both tokens are ready to extend their gains
AMBCrypto’s assessment of ICP and DOGE’s price movements on a 24-hour chart revealed the possibility of further price gains.
Trading at a two-year high at press time, ICP exchanged hands at $17.85. Confirming the recent uptrend, its Aroon Up Line (orange) was 92.86%. This indicator measures an asset’s trend strength and potential trend reversal points in its price movement.
When an asset’s Aroon Up Line returns a value close to 100, it indicates that the current market uptrend is strong and that the most recent high was reached relatively recently.
Also, readings from the altcoin’s Directional Movement Index (DMI) showed its positive directional index (green) resting significantly above its negative index (red). 
When these trend lines are positioned this way, the buying pressure in the market is significantly higher than the selling pressure. It also indicates a strong uptrend in the price of the asset.
Further, the gap between these lines is also noteworthy because the wider it is, the stronger the trend is considered to be. The gap between ICP’s positive and negative directional indexes was considerably wide at the time of writing.
At press time, the token’s Money Flow Index (MFI) trended upward and returned a value of 80.36, indicating that the price rally was backed by real demand. This showed that market participants favored ICP accumulation over selling their holdings for profit.

DOGE follows suit
Regarding meme coin DOGE, readings from some of its key technical indicators revealed that it followed a similar trend and was poised to extend its gains. 
For example, the coin’s MACD line crossed above its signal line on 26th March. This was a bullish signal, suggesting that the shorter-term moving average had begun gaining strength relative to the longer-term moving average.

Also, DOGE’s Parabolic SAR indicator, which tracks its potential trend direction and reversals, showed significant bullish sentiment. The dotted lines comprising the indicator rested below the coin’s price at price time.
When these dotted lines are positioned in this way, the market is deemed to be in an uptrend.

The launch follows Bybit’s partnership with SATOS, a crypto platform with operations in the Netherlands and Belgium since 2013.

                        The Ethereum network has surpassed one million validators, with approximately 32 million Ether, worth around $114 billion, staked within the network.According to data from the Dune Analytics dashboard, which tracks Ethereum staking progress, the validator count reached the one million mark on March 28. The 32 million ETH staked represents approximately 26% of the total supply, highlighting the substantial commitment to Ethereum’s proof-of-stake (PoS) consensus mechanism.Lido Accounts for 30% of Staked ETH
Among the staking options available, about 30% of the ETH is staked through Lido, an Ethereum staking pool that allows users with smaller amounts of ETH to pool their assets and participate in the staking process.Validators play a crucial role in maintaining the security of the Ethereum blockchain by monitoring transactions for any malicious activities, such as double-spending. In Ethereum, validators propose and validate transactions within the network, requiring a stake of 32 ETH. In return for their participation, validators receive rewards in the form of a portion of ETH.While a higher number of validators generally enhances blockchain security, some members of the Ethereum community express concerns about potential issues arising from an excessive number of validators. Evan Van Ness, a venture investor and Ethereum advocate, suggests that there may already be “too much” staked. Gabriel Weide, operator of a staking pool, warns that an abundance of validators could lead to an increase in “failed transactions.”Addressing the network’s decentralization, Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin recently proposed a mechanism to improve the system. In a blog post, Buterin suggested penalizing validators in proportion to their average failure rate. By implementing this approach, penalties would be higher if multiple validators fail within a given slot, potentially reducing the advantage of larger ETH stakers over smaller ones.SEC Postpones ETH ETF Decisions
The SEC has recently postponed its decision on the applications for Ether (ETH) ETFs from major financial institutions like BlackRock and Fidelity. The final deadlines for these decisions have been extended to May 2024. The SEC’s decision to extend the deadline follows its earlier postponement in December 2023, during which it sought additional public input on whether the ETF should be listed. Grayscale had proposed listing and trading shares of its Ethereum Futures Trust ETF under the New York Stock Exchange Arca Rule 8.200-E in September 2023. Bloomberg Intelligence ETF analysts James Seyffart and Eric Balchunas have both expressed their calibrated predictions of the pending approvals, expecting a potentially persisting denial in May.“Our odds of eth ETF approval by May deadline are down to 35%,” stated Balchunas. “I get all the reasons they SHOULD approve it (and we personally believe they should) but all the signs/sources that were making us bullish 2.5mo out for btc spot are not there this time.”

Dogecoin (DOGE) Explodes 10% Daily, Bitcoin (BTC) Reclaims $70K (Market Watch)


																Bitcoin slumped hard yesterday and dropped below $69,000, but the bulls have taken charge since then, and the asset now stands well above $70,000.
While most alternative coins are slightly in the green, DOGE and BCH have gone on a tear with double-digit price gains overnight.
BTC Goes Above $70K
Last week was quite negative for the largest cryptocurrency, in which it fell to under $61,000 at one point and was down to $62,500 on Friday. The weekend finally saw a recovery attempt but BTC was stopped at $66,000.
It wasn’t until Monday that the asset started actually charting meaningful increases and soared to $70,000. More gains came on Tuesday and Wednesday that culminated in jumping to almost $72,000 yesterday.
However, the cryptocurrency failed to overcome that level, and the subsequent rejection pushed it south by over three grand to $68,500. The landscape now is quite different, and Bitcoin has returned to over $70,500 as the community’s anticipation for a $100,000 price tag grows stronger.

DOGE, BCH Go Up
Most altcoins were in a retrace mode yesterday but have managed to erase a large portion of the losses today. Binance Coin, Ripple, Toncoin, and Chainlink have increased by somewhere between 1% and 3%. Ethereum, SOL, ADA, and DOT are also in the green but in a more modest fashion.
Shiba Inu has gained over 4% overnight, but its increase is trumped by its older and larger brother – Dogecoin. DOGE has jumped by over 10% in a day and sits above $0.2.
Bitcoin Cash is the other notable gainer from the larger-cap alts. Just days ahead of its next halving, BCH has soared by 13% to over $550.
The cumulative market cap of all crypto assets has increased by about $50 billion overnight but still stands below $2.8 trillion.

Ethena Protocol Launches ENA Token and Announces Sustainable Strategy


							

Ethena Protocol announces the launch of its ENA token aligned with the protocol’s sustainable strategies



The protocol also announced the ENA token distribution features vesting schedule. 



The new Shard Campaign will introduce Sats Campaign, focusing on Bitcoin integration and boosted rewards.




Recently, the widely growing Ethena Protocol announced the launch of the ENA token. This launch marks a significant milestone in the evolution of digital currencies.



Notably, the protocol’s USDe supply has surged to over $1 billion, making it one of the fastest USD-denominated assets to reach this milestone in crypto history. This feat underlines Ethena’s position as a new emerging leader in the DeFi landscape.



With its growing ecosystem, Ethena has attracted key players in the DeFi space, including MakerDAO, Frax, Curve Finance, and Aave, among others. These integrations also show the growing relevance and adoption of Ethena’s USDe stablecoin within the broader DeFi ecosystem.



Scheduled for April 2nd, users will have the opportunity to claim their share of 750 million ENA tokens, representing 5% of the total supply, based on their accumulated shards—a measure of their contribution to the Ethena ecosystem.



To ensure the longevity and sustainability of the ENA token distribution, a vesting schedule has been implemented particularly for the top 2000 wallets and holders of Pendle’s YT token. This vesting mechanism aims to give incentives to long-term participants of the Ethena ecosystem.



Furthermore, the ENA tokenomics outlines a distribution plan that allocates tokens to core contributors, investors, the foundation, and ecosystem development initiatives. These allocations reflect Ethena’s commitment to fostering growth, innovation, and community engagement within the DeFi space.



Ethena is about to begin its second season of the Shard Campaign, aptly named the Sats Campaign. This new campaign comes along with the protocol’s aim of Bitcoin as a backing asset.

Realio Network: the crypto RIO marks a +250% in 9 days

In recent days, the market’s attention has been drawn to the graphic performance of the Realio Network (RIO) crypto and the increasingly growing trend of the Real World Asset (RWA) sector.
RIO marks today its sixth consecutive green candle, standing at +250 since March 20th.
How far will this promising currency go?
Let’s see all the details below.

What is the RWA Realio Network project?
Realio Network is a SaaS (Software as a Service) platform that offers an integrated solution for issuance, investment, and management of the lifecycle of tokenized real-world assets, such as private equity, real estate, bonds, as well as for native digital assets such as cryptocurrencies.
The RWA project presents its own blockchain, built with Cosmos SDK, which serves as a layer for transactions within the Realio ecosystem.
At the center of the decentralized network is the RIO crypto, gas token that allows the user to facilitate a wide range of operations such as paying for requests for tokenization and participating in platform management.
Owners of RIO can take part in the governance of the project by voting on ecosystem upgrade proposals.
Distributed consensus is achieved with a native dual-token POS mechanism that uses RIO and another resource called RST.
There is also an L2 that reduces gas fees for more advanced DeFi services and for issuing digital tokens.
Among the various functions available in the app realio.fund, we also find the possibility to carry out decentralized swaps, cross-chain exchanges, delegation in governance processes, investments in various types of assets.

The goal of Realio is to offer advanced blockchain technology, capable of leveraging institutional quality investment opportunities in the world of real assets, while at the same time combining the advantages of decentralized finance and P2P exchanges.
The company managing the project was founded in 2018 in New York by Derek S. Boiron and Aaron Gooch, but currently all Limited companies are based in the Cayman Islands and the British Virgin Islands.
Despite this, it appears to be openly compliant with the standards established by the US SEC, and requires its users to undergo verification KYC during the registration phase.
Given the dominant trend of RWA in the crypto space, we will probably hear a lot more about this innovative project for a long time.
Think that even companies like BlackRock and Morgan Stanley are starting to invest in this sector.
.

Analysis of the prices of the crypto RIO: how far can it go?
The crypto RIO is attracting the attention of retail investors after the performances recorded in the market, where the currency RWA has exceeded the $3 threshold printing a +250% in the last 9 days of trading.
With the latest upward movement, RIO managed to surpass the peak of 2.78 dollars in May 2021, which marked the end of the bull market and the beginning of a long bearish phase that led the same coin to touch the bottom at 0.02 dollars in December 2022.
From that moment to today RIO is gaining an incredible amount of 13400%, surpassing any other result in the cryptocurrency market.

With a low emissions tokenomics of new tokens that stimulates speculation and a market capitalization still relatively low at 21 million dollars, RIO still has many growth opportunities ahead, but at the same time many challenges.
First of all, the RWA sector token needs to be listed on other major exchanges outside of OKX, which is the dominant market, HTX, MEXC and BINGX.
A listing on Binance, Bybit or Coinbase could definitely give an additional bullish push to the coin, which now has to face its price discovery phase.
Be careful not to be caught up in FOMO because the coin is now recording one of its highest RSI levels ever on the weekly chart, and it comes after two vertical green candles, which could pave the way for a slow distribution phase.
In the medium/long term, RIO can definitely be one of the most interesting horses, especially considering the growth prospects of the Real World Asset sector, and we could hypothesize at least reaching a market cap of 100 million dollars, which would translate into a coin price of 15 dollars.
However, the immaturity and youth of tokenization platforms, combined with the speculative nature of the crypto market, could highlight better in the future more established projects in this field such as Avalanche, Ondo and Chainlink, disadvantaging emerging platforms like Realio.

Coinbase CEO Explains Why They Got 'Huge Win' Against SEC


The CEO of Coinbase has shared an update on the company's ongoing legal fight with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. The court's latest decision has been described as a "huge win" for the future of self-custodial wallets and the blockchain ecosystem.The court ruled to proceed with most of the SEC's claims against Coinbase but, importantly, dismissed the claims aimed at Coinbase Wallet. This decision is seen as a victory for Coinbase and the crypto industry, emphasizing the importance of achieving clarity in the regulation of digital assets. The CEO expressed readiness to delve deeper into the SEC's internal perspectives on cryptocurrency regulation as the case progresses. Obtaining clarity from early court decisions, especially against government agencies, is close to impossible, but at the same time, it would make the life of companies operating in the industry much easier. This clarity is what Coinbase aims for.In light of this, the CEO urges Congress to push forward with legislation that supports digital asset innovation in the United States, emphasizing the need for the country to remain a hub for technological advancement.The court's recognition that innovations like the Coinbase Wallet do not fall under U.S. securities laws has been particularly welcomed by Coinbase. This acknowledgment supports the company's position that the technology driving cryptocurrency and self-custodial wallets should not be restricted by outdated rules.Practically, Coinbase and many other crypto-related companies want nothing but clarity from regulators and updated laws and rules. Additionally, Coinbase is trying to get official documents from the SEC that would clarify their stance on digital assets.

$0DOG prediction: Bitcoin Dogs sets a new tone amid robust use cases and BTC link - CoinJournal



                    

                    
Bitcoin Dogs token is set for listing as post-listing speculation gains mount.
Investors have been attracted by Bitcoin Dogs as the first ICO on the Bitcoin blockchain.
The token could rise to $1 amid speculation and use cases.

As Bitcoin Dogs ($0DOG) presale came to its ultimate halt on March 15, one thing was clear. The presale had exceeded expectations, raising nearly $13.5 million within a month. Investors were particularly interested in this token, being the first ICO on the Bitcoin blockchain. As such, predictions are rife that this token could surge strongly when it debuts on exchanges. Let’s dive in and explore the $0DOG potential as 100x predictions surface.
Bitcoin Dogs: A 100x potential token and the first Bitcoin ICO
As Bitcoin price hits levels about the 2021 record, attention has shifted to Bitcoin Dogs. Experts predict that as Bitcoin gains in value, Bitcoin Dogs will attract a positive sentiment. That’s partly because Bitcoin Dogs is the first-ever BRC-20 minted token. As such, investors looking for a share of the legacy Bitcoin network see Bitcoin Dogs as a sound alternative.
Being a Bitcoin-linked crypto token has won the hearts of Bitcoin Dogs backers. Bitcoin is the oldest blockchain and carries robust security features. This has allowed Bitcoin Dogs to ride the positive reception of Bitcoin and become a trailblazer in the presale. 
Besides, a lot of speculation remains in the crypto markets regarding Bitcoin developments in 2024. These include the approvals of the first spot Bitcoin ETFs earlier in the year and the halving event in April. The positive sentiment could flow into Bitcoin Dogs and help in its price discovery.
There is a lot to expect as Bitcoin Dogs eyes the next step in its budding life. That includes a listing on centralised exchanges (CEXs), scheduled for the first quarter. Owing to the strengths of Bitcoin Dogs in the presale, the listing will be met with a lot of token speculation. But Bitcoin Dogs has attracted attention with its exciting use cases. 
Biggest Bitcoin ordinals and Dogaverse experiences
Bitcoin Dogs spotlight seems to have also been inspired by its alluring NFT collection. This is a 10,000 unique and collectible tokens that would be available to $0DOG holders. And guess what? The collection will be the biggest Bitcoin ordinals NFT collection.
Users can curate and display their collectibles for sale within the Bitcoin Dogs NFT metaverse. Thanks to this feature, users have found a sound alternative to owning a piece of digital art. This comes even as Bitcoin NFTs gain popularity and Web 3.0 applications recover from the bear market lows. Bitcoin Dogs doesn’t stop there.
The platform features virtual interactions through its metaverse-themed Dogaverse. Fans are thrilled that virtual realities are fast gaining attention and Bitcoin Dogs is part of the transition. Once launched, $0DOG holders can immerse themselves in exciting experiences, opening up new opportunities. Fans can engage in dog training sessions, interact with fellow dog holders, and engage in competitions. As the metaverse ecosystem grows, the use case of $0DOG will be strengthened, boasting its price.
Bitcoin Dogs ($ODOG) prediction in 2024
A bullish crypto market, Bitcoin Dogs’ use cases, and its relationship to Bitcoin make the token attractive. This could allow $0DOG to surge wildly and claim a coveted 100x gain. Tokens that have attracted a lot of FOMO have risen and exceeded the margins in the past. 
With the presale’s starting price of $0.015, a possible 100x gain could see the token rise to above $1. Although speculative, favourable factors and investors buying the token on exchanges make the price realistic.
In the future, the price of Bitcoin Dogs will be pegged on its diverse use cases. The launch of the NFT marketplace and metaverse could see $ODOG deployed more in Web 3.0. Being the first Bitcoin ICO means Bitcoin Dogs will gain fast traction in the application areas. This will see the token continue increasing in value.

Bitcoin (BTC) Reward Halving Could Bolster ETF Tailwinds for the Cryptocurrency: Canaccord

“While the macro outlook and timing of potential rate cuts remain uncertain, the upcoming halving event could add to the ETF tailwinds for bitcoin,” analysts led by Michael Graham wrote, adding that “for the rest of the ecosystem, activity levels continue to rebound from 2023 lows.” The quadrennial halving is when miner rewards are slashed by 50%, thereby reducing the supply of bitcoin. The next halving is expected in April. Canaccord says it is encouraged by the Securities and Exchange Commission’s (SEC) approval of 11 U.S. spot bitcoin ETFs in the quarter. “While bitcoin’s increase in value during Q1 was far greater than ETF inflows, this tailwind should persist as retail investors look to add crypto exposure to IRAs and other tax-advantaged accounts, and we expect spot ETFs could become a more meaningful part of bitcoin’s price action going forward,” the authors wrote. IRAs are a way of saving for retirement in the U.S.

Canadian authorities move to seize assets tied to QuadrigaCX CEO

The director of civil forfeiture in the Canadian province of British Columbia has made an unexplained wealth order to confiscate cash, 45 gold bars and luxury items found in a safe deposit box linked to a co-founder of the QuadrigaCX cryptocurrency exchange.An unexplained wealth order is a type of court order that compels a person to explain how they acquired their assets. Mike Farnworth, the province’s minister of public safety and solicitor general, said in a statement:“Through this action, we are demonstrating again that criminals will have to prove that their assets are the proceeds of lawful activity and not financial crime. The international, criminal actions of Quadriga Coin Exchange (Quadriga CX) led to thousands of people losing their life savings.”QuadrigaCX, once the largest cryptocurrency exchange in Canada, became insolvent in February 2019, shortly after its co-founder, Gerald Cotten, died in India, taking the private keys to QuadrigaCX’s offline storage systems to the grave.According to documents submitted to the British Columbia Supreme Court, the assets are allegedly the proceeds of criminal activities linked to Michael Patryn, co-founder of Quadriga Coin Exchange, and Gerald Cotten. The order facilitated the seizure of a safe deposit box at CIBC Bank along with an account. Related: QuadrigaCX creditors set to receive 13% of their claims as an ‘interim dividend’ Civil forfeiture has existed in British Columbia since 2006, allowing the province to confiscate property without criminal charges.Inside the safe deposit box were 250,200 Canadian dollars ($184,250) in cash, gold bars, two Rolex watches, a Chanel J12 Black Diamond watch and other jewelry items. Additionally, the box contained a 45-caliber Ruger 1911 pistol with ammunition and identity documents bearing the names Omar Dhanani and Omar Patryn, according to the CBC.The order contends that Patryn played a significant role in QuadrigaCX’s activities, including misappropriating customer funds and cryptocurrency, justifying the seizure of assets. Following the seizure, the next course of action is to prompt a response from Patryn to account for his wealth. After QuadrigaCX’s collapse, Patryn embarked on a new venture in decentralized finance, participating in various protocols like Wonderland and UwU Lend, using the alias “Sifu.” Michael Patryn was previously known as Omar Dhanani before two name changes in 2003 and 2008. He has been convicted of various financial crimes in the United States. Magazine: $3.4B of Bitcoin in a popcorn tin — The Silk Road hacker’s story

Bitwise CIO on the Future of Spot Bitcoin ETFs: Insights from a 20-Day Financial Odyssey | Cryptoglobe


                                
Matt Hougan is the Chief Investment Officer (CIO) at Bitwise Asset Management (aka “Bitwise Investments”). Hougan is well-regarded in the investment community for his deep expertise in exchange-traded funds (ETFs) and cryptocurrency. He has been a vocal advocate for the potential of cryptocurrencies to transform the financial industry, contributing to Bitwise’s mission of bridging the gap between traditional financial markets and the emerging crypto economy. 



On March 26, Hougan shared insights from his extensive 20-day journey across various financial circles. In a post on the social media platform X, Hougan conveyed his observations and predictions about the future of cryptocurrency investments, particularly focusing on spot Bitcoin ETFs, investor demand in different regions, and the shifting attitudes towards allocation percentages in investment portfolios.



Hougan expressed optimism about the sustained demand for spot Bitcoin ETFs, dismissing the notion that the remarkable inflows witnessed during the initial months were merely a temporary surge. His interactions with financial advisors and national account platforms revealed a significant disparity in the adoption pace of spot Bitcoin ETFs, indicating a long-term growth trajectory similar to that of gold ETFs but potentially unfolding over a shorter period. Hougan’s conviction is rooted in the understanding that a considerable segment of professional investors is yet to engage with spot Bitcoin ETFs, a situation he expects to evolve positively over the next two years as more due diligence processes are completed.







            
            

            
            

            
            

        

While in London for Blockworks’ Digital Asset Summit, Hougan noted a stark contrast in investor demand between the UK and the US, attributing the lag in the UK to more conservative regulatory stances towards cryptocurrencies. He mentioned that despite the vibrant developer and institutional trading communities in the UK, the end-investor demand remains in its infancy compared to the transformative impact ETFs have had in the US market. This observation led Hougan to reflect on the perceived progressiveness of US regulatory frameworks from the perspective of UK stakeholders eagerly eyeing advancements across the Atlantic.



Another significant shift highlighted by Hougan is the increase in the recommended allocation to Bitcoin within investment portfolios. Where a 1% allocation was the norm among professional investors discussing Bitcoin since 2018, Hougan has observed a paradigm shift towards a 3% or higher allocation. This change, he believes, is largely due to the introduction of spot Bitcoin ETFs, which have mitigated the perceived downside risk of Bitcoin investments, making higher allocations more palatable for investors.

QuadrigaCX Co-founder Faces “Unexplained Wealth” Case in Canada - DailyCoin


        
The QuadrigaCX crypto scandal continues.



The exchange’s surviving co-founder is facing a new court order.



The court order seeks to compel the co-founder to explain how he came by some seized assets.
Michael Patryn, a co-founder of defunct crypto exchange QuadrigaCX, is the target of an “unexplained wealth order” seeking to compel him to explain the source of funds used to obtain a cash hoard, gold bars, and luxury watches.Patryn is the surviving co-founder of QuadrigaCX, a trading platform that collapsed in 2019 due to a Ponzi scheme operated by its CEO and founder, Gerald Cotten. Cotten died unexpectedly in 2018 at the age of 30 while volunteering at an orphanage in India.British Columbia Authorities Target PatrynAccording to a Bloomberg report on March 28, the Director of Civil Forfeiture in British Columbia has sought a court order to force Patryn to explain how he came by over $600,000 in assets, which were seized by the Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) in June 2021.The assets in question include a cash hoard of C$250,200 ($184,250), 45 gold bars, two diamond-studded Rolex watches, Chanel J12 Black Diamond watches, and other jewelry. The assets were seized from a Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce safety deposit box in Vancouver, along with a 45-caliber Ruger 1911 pistol with ammunition.While Patryn’s lawyer had intimated in October last year that the seized assets weren’t linked to illegal activity, the co-founder must demonstrate that every item was legitimately acquired or risk forfeiting them.“Gold bars may be highly liquid and flashy luxury goods, such as jewelry and Rolex watches, attract attention, but they are also attracting the attention of police and our government. If they are the proceeds of criminal activity like fraud, drug trafficking or money laundering, we will go after them,” Mike Farnworth, Minister of Public Safety and Solicitor General, stated.Per Farnworth, if the assets are forfeited, their proceeds would be donated to crime victims and crime prevention services.

Solana Dominates Altcoin Market: Are ETH, ADA and LINK Bulls NGMI? - Coin Edition


							

Cardano bull Dan Gambardello addressed Solana’s bullish performance against ETH, ADA, and LINK.



SOL has seen over 850% gain in six months, while ETH, ADA, and LINK see less comparable gains.



Gambardello argued the altcoin season would commence after halving, and the game would change.




Solana (SOL) has been an extraordinary performer in the crypto scene for the past six months. Since last October, it has recorded over 850% gain, soaring from around $21 to above $200. Meanwhile, rivals such as Chainlink (LINK) gained about 200% during the same period. Ethereum (ETH) and Cardano (ADA) have witnessed gains exceeding 100%.



Notably, Solana’s astronomic gains took place before the Bitcoin’s halving, with the much-awaited altcoin season in the initial phase. This has led to concern about whether it’s game over for other top market contenders as Solana continues to dominate the spotlight among the most prominent cryptos.



Weighing in on this conversation is the popular Cardano bull Dan Gambardello. In a recent analysis, Gambardello attempted to clarify the performance of Ethereum, Cardano, and Chainlink in relation to Solana. 







Gambardello cited market data suggesting Solana is the only asset among the most valuable tokens outperforming Bitcoin. While he praised SOL, the analyst argued that the development is not unprecedented. 



On this premise, he recalled the price trajectory of Chainlink in the last bull cycle. Gambardello emphasized that LINK similarly experienced explosive gains of up to 1,000% gains pre-Bitcoin halving.



In contrast, contenders like ADA, SOL, and ETH did almost nothing while LINK mooned. Meanwhile, the analyst noted that Chainlink maintained its bullish momentum even after Bitcoin halved in 2020 but soon lost its steam. 



Essentially, Gambardello sought to emphasize that Solana’s lone bullish trajectory should not overly concern market participants to the extent that they believe other coins will never have their moment.  He stressed that the altcoin season is poised to commence after Bitcoin halves, and the game will really change.

Ethena prepares for governance token launch with a major airdrop

Alongside the significant move in the DeFi sector, Ethena, the protocol that governs USDe, a $1.3 billion token, will launch its ENA governance token soon. The most important action follows on April 2nd when the project enters its new phase, facilitating the release of 750 million ENA tokens, or 5% of the entire supply, distributed among the platform’s universe of users.Strengthening Ethena’s network through ENA airdrop initiativesThe protocol set down the entry procedure for the community members so they could partake in the airdrop while announcing that the engagement and commitment could help the platform grow. Those looking to earn the airdrop must work on their worthiness, shown in the number of shards they collected (shards contain one’s stake and involvement in the ecosystem). The cutoff for earning shards is set for April 1, with a clear guideline: If anyone in the community misses the date by unstaking, unlocking, or selling their USDe tokens before time fits, he/she will not be eligible for the AMAs. The distribution will be complete by listing ENA on well-established centralized exchanges, allowing new people to participate in the Ethena ecosystem.Revolutionizing yield generation with Ethena’s innovative token strategyOn top of that, 10% of the tokens are reserved for players and sold through airdrop, both a reward for current users and a lever allowing each of them to participate in Ethena‘s governance. Post-airdrop, the project is laying out a line of fresh incentives to keep the users hooked on the platform. Besides, the project aims to develop a stable ecosystem that is a real strength.The success and market value of Ethena, which are directly related to its creative technology idea for business-aimed token production, are proof of this. The USDe coin, sometimes called the “synthetic dollar,” opened up the option for steady yields by forcing liquid ether (ETH) staking tokens, including Lido’s stETH, to work as the backing assets. To create such a pair, we take a position worth long ETH perpetual futures of the same amount on the derivatives’ platform, trying to set a price at $1. Derivatives yield rates are examined via the “cash and carry” trade scheme.This business structure has exceeded the expectations of Ethena, starting with 85 million dollar value of USDe token on the first day of the year and then crossing the milestone of north of 1300 billion at the end of the year, which can be seen from the DefiLlama pricing. The swelling results from two factors: the possibility of wonderful profits prompted by the cryptocurrency interplay and the expectation of the ENA token airdropping, which is awaited.ENA token launch catalyzing growth and decentralization in Ethena’s futureAdding the ENA governance token to the Ethena community is significant for both Ethena and its participants. Through institutionalizing a governance architecture, the protocol is evolving to a more disintermediated and user-driven structure, in which token holders have a say and influence on the platform’s path and future. This move is twofold. First, by definition, Ethena agrees with decentralized finance, further consolidating its position in the competitive market.USA will focus on the token as a drive for expansion and enrichment and the governance structure to guarantee innovation, transparency, and good communal input. Smart contracts exploitation marketing campaigns are set to receive the intended spotlight from the existing DeFi contributors and new users, which will widen Ethena’s market hold in the blockchain sphere.Ethena’s ENA token distribution via an airdrop emphasizes the dedication to communal representation and decentralized handling of the network, which the protocol has shown. With more developed functionality and integration of these features, such as increased risk management, the platform positioned itself for the DeFi space, which will inevitably spur growth and innovation.

DeFi Saver integrates Safe to bring account abstraction to DeFi | Cryptopolitan

Delaware, USA, March 28th, 2024, ChainwireIn a move to greatly improve the user experience of DeFi users in the Ethereum ecosystem, DeFi Saver integrated native support for Safe smart accounts and multisigs.DeFi Saver, one of the leading apps for creating, tracking, and managing DeFi positions on Ethereum just announced they’ve integrated account abstraction leader Safe, to take the experience of DeFi users to the next level. This comes on the back of Safe’s recently announced milestone of more than $100 billion in digital assets secured on Safe smart accounts, with more than 40 million transactions conducted on Safe infrastructure.The update means that DeFi users of protocols such as Aave, Compound, Morpho Blue, Spark, CurveUSD and Liquity will be able to manage their positions more efficiently, through use of options that bundle or batch multiple actions into one single transaction using the power of the Safe smart accounts. This includes features such as leveraging up or unwinding in one transaction, doing collateral and debt swaps, moving whole active positions between different protocols, various automation features, but also even simpler things such as depositing collateral and borrowing funds in one, single transaction. All of this results in unnecessary steps being abstracted away from DeFi users and traders.Besides all the advanced features that are made possible through use of a smart account, this update also allows DeFi users to greatly increase their security through the use of Safe multisigs, which are the security standard for asset ownership. Starting today, all current and new users can enjoy native multisig support at DeFi Saver moving forward.Another important aspect for both teams is the composability and portability that users will enjoy. Since Safe is widely supported in DeFi apps and frontends, this means that all DeFi Saver users will be able to check and manage their positions through other apps. And, vice versa, all existing Safe users can now seamlessly connect to the DeFi Saver app and make use of the plethora of tools available.“We believe that composability and portability are some of the greatest, most important aspects of DeFi and yet this primitive is being ignored by many teams opting to build small, proprietary, walled garden systems. That’s why we chose Safe and intend to keep building on the open, permissionless building blocks.” said Nenad Palinkasevic, the co-founder of DeFi Saver.Lukas Schor, co-founder at Safe, commented, “Smart Accounts are critical infrastructure and we think that for DeFi mass adoption, we need the security of smart accounts, but also the UX benefits to already integrate within the top DeFi projects today. We welcome this move by DeFi Saver to accelerate the transition to smart accounts and Safe ecosystem.”  Moving forward, the teams also highlighted that this change will allow great improvements to the user experience in DeFi through continued batching of multiple actions into single transactions, but also through features such as sign-only modes where all transactions would be handled for the users in the background, providing a quicker and smoother experience.About DeFi SaverDeFi Saver is a management application for decentralized finance protocols best known for their advanced leverage management features and automated liquidation protection options. Having initially started as a MakerDAO-focused dapp in the early days of DeFi, they quickly expanded support to more protocols, as well as multiple L2 networks.

Ripple Vs. SEC Saga: Legal Expert Unravels The "Bigger Argument" | Bitcoinist.com


								Former founder and chairman of Murphy and McGonigle law firm James A. Murphy, also known as MetaLawMan, has delved into the legal battle between Ripple Labs and the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), offering his perspective on the bigger argument in the case.
Bigger Argument Within The Ripple Vs. SEC Case
James Murphy revealed his insights on the legal dispute in an interview with Scott Melker on the Wolf where he examined the SEC’s damages theory in the case. According to Murphy, Ripple recently had a very lucky break, which he perceives as the bigger argument in the court case.

He then drew attention to a previous ruling by the Second Circuit Court of Appeals, which states that the SEC must prove misconduct by naming actual money-losing victims or something identified as pecuniary harm in order for there to be a disgorgement.
He stated:
The Second Circuit Court of Appeals ruled at the end of last year that in order for there to be a disgorgement, there have to be victims of the frauds, victims of the securities law violation. There has to be something called the pecuniary harm that means actual losses.
However, applying this statement to the SEC’s filing on the damages theory, Murphy asserted that a piece of the filing mentioned the presence of pecuniary harm in XRP sales, but they do not correspond to a single purchase of XRP.
Generally, the SEC’s lawsuit is predicated on the notion that certain buyers of XRP were adversely affected financially because they purchased the product at a lower price than others. 
Consequently, it would be difficult for the court to demonstrate that the proposed $850 million punishment is appropriate in the absence of actual harm evidence. Considering the nature of the case, Murphy believes that the aforementioned figure will be significantly lower when punishment is finally established.
Addressing the concept of disgorgement, Murphy emphasized that in the absence of identifiable victims, the disgorgement that seeks to reimburse those harmed for illegitimate profits becomes unsustainable.
Therefore, there is no $200 million interest since interest triggers a disgorgement. Nonetheless, it is still possible to have a penalty in the absence of victims and disgorgement judgment.
$2 Billion Fine Request By The SEC
It is noteworthy that the SEC has filed a motion asking US Judge Torres Analisa to grant its requested fine of about $2 billion from Ripple as its final judgment against the payment firm.

The regulatory watchdog is requesting $1,950,768,364 in total from Ripple. Specifically, the grant would propel Ripple to pay $876,308,712 in disgorgement and demand a civil penalty of $876,308,712 and prejudgment interest of $198,150,940. 
So far, Ripple Chief Executive Officer (CEO) Brad Garlinghouse has criticized the agency regarding the move. Garlinghouse slammed the SEC, saying that this had never been done before and that he and the firm would keep exposing the Commission to what it is when they respond to the motion.

YouTuber Logan Paul argues CryptoZoo ‘isn’t a scam’ in new documentary

YouTuber Logan Paul has argued that his infamous CryptoZoo project, which resulted in many investors losing money, was not a scam.In a new documentary, 5 Months with Logan Paul, journalist Graham Bensinger sat down with Paul to get his side of the story on the CryptoZoo nonfungible token (NFT) gaming project. The duo spoke about the many allegations hurled at the internet celebrity, with Bensinger reiterating the point that the exposure brought by Paul “led people to lose money.” Logan Paul answering questions about CryptoZoo. Source: YouTubePaul admitted that there’s an element of truth to the statement. However, the YouTuber argued it was not a scam. Paul added: “Everything you just said has an element of truth to it. Here’s the problem. What you just described isn’t a scam. I took on a project that I was simply incapable of handling at the time.”Paul argued that he also lost money in the project, seemingly implying he was also a victim. “I didn’t make any fucking money, bro. I’ve lost half a million dollars on this. Where is the scam?”The YouTuber also said in the documentary that he’s had suicidal thoughts because of the CryptoZoo project. “For the first time in my life, I was having suicidal thoughts. I was just spiraling,” he said. Related: YouTuber KSI faces pump-and-dump allegations from ZachXBT and CoffeezillaApart from attempts to counter allegations, Paul also said in the documentary that he’s going to “take care” of the people who made CryptoZoo look like it was a scam perpetuated by him. He said: “The CryptoZoo saga is far from over because it was a one-sided story. He [Coffeezilla] told it how he wanted to tell it and told it a certain way that made me look like the captain of the ship.”This isn't the first time Paul has promised to act against those who have reported about CryptoZoo. In January 2023, Paul threatened to take legal action against YouTube journalist Stephen Findeisen — also known as Coffeezilla — after Findeisen published a piece on the project. However, Paul quickly backtracked on the threats and apologized to Findeisen days later. In the same month, Paul unveiled a $1.5 million recovery plan for those affected by the failed project. However, it took a year and a class-action lawsuit before the buyback plan was implemented. In February 2023, disgruntled investors filed a class-action lawsuit against CryptoZoo and Paul, alleging that the venture performed a rug pull. The plaintiffs alleged that Paul and the project stole millions of dollars through the venture. Source: NAWOT On Jan. 5, Paul announced that the buyback program would begin. However, it included a catch: Users could only get a refund if they waived any current or future claims against the YouTuber.Magazine: ‘Am I sorry?

XRP and XLM about to ‘melt faces;’ Here’s why


With the optimistic sentiment still ruling the cryptocurrency sector, crypto technical analysts have observed that the chart patterns of some of its assets are displaying signs of possible ‘face-melting’ rallies in the near future, in particular those of XRP and Stellar lumens (XLM).
As it happens, pseudonymous crypto market analyst Charting Guy has recently pointed out that the “2 coins that have traded sideways or as some say, ‘done nothing’ for 6 years” would “melt faces very soon,” as he explained in an X thread published on March 27.
Indeed, the expert stressed that both “have been consolidating with higher lows, but also lower highs,” forming a symmetrical triangle pattern, which are the “biggest ones I’ve ever seen and their apexes are rather close,” citing his colleague Coins Kid who said that “compression leads to expansion.”


XRP price prediction
Specifically, Charting Guy noted that XRP, the token at the center of the court standoff between the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and blockchain company Ripple, was targeting an area between $10 and $13, as its symmetrical triangle casually aligned with the top of the observed channel.

As a reminder, the XRP price at press time stands at a mere $0.6198, down 0.01% on the day, gaining 0.01% across the week, and advancing 5.46% in the last month, which means it could soon grow its price between an immense 1,513.42% and 1,997.45%, should the crypto analyst’s predictions prove correct.

XLM price prediction
At the same time, Charting Guy highlighted that XLM was making the same pattern, emphasizing the fact that “these 2 charts are almost identical and they have a very high correlation in price movement,” which could lead Stellar lumens toward hitting the price in the $2.50 zone.

Currently, XLM is changing hands at the price of $0.1367, recording an increase of 0.54% in the last 24 hours, adding 3.47% to its value across the previous seven days, and growing 13.74% on its monthly chart. Should the expert’s prognoses materialize, it could further gain 1,728.42%.

Finally, as Charting Guy concluded in response to potential critics of his theory:

“i don’t think you all understand the [total addressable market (TAM)] of XRP & XLM. these coins will run the new financial system as a neutral bridge currencies that connect [central bank digital currencies (CBDCs)]. f*ck trillions. we’re talking QUADRILLIONS of dollars.”

Meanwhile, Coins Kid, the pseudonymous crypto market specialist and a staunch believer in XRP’s future quoted by Charting Guy, shared these remarks on his own X profile, commenting in agreement that the “time in the market beats timing the market,” as he said on March 27.
Ultimately, time will tell whether the above predictions come true, but it is important to remember that trends in this industry could easily change, so doing one’s own research and reading up on XLM and XRP news is critical before investing in these assets.

Dogecoin Jumps 10% to Clear $0.20 for First Time Since 2021 - Decrypt

Dog-themed meme crypto Dogecoin has surged by 10% in the past day, reclaiming $0.20 for the first time since December 2021.Dogecoin is currently priced at $0.2038, up 10.8% on the day and 34.6% on the week, per data from CoinGecko. The cryptocurrency last hit $0.20 on December 4, 2021, according to the crypto price tracker. It remains a far cry from its all-time high price of $0.73, posted in May of that year at the height of the crypto bull market.The meme coin's price bump comes days after Twitter's artificial intelligence chatbot Grok told some users that Dogecoin payments on the platform were possible—likely as the result of an AI hallucination, since no such functionality has been enabled.In a Twitter thread, Dogecoin developer Mishaboar speculated that Twitter crypto payments could be implemented "much earlier" than a five year horizon, albeit "probably not sooner than next year," arguing that payment services such as PayPal already support crypto.Elon Musk, Twitter payments and DogecoinTwitter owner and chariman Elon Musk has previously revealed his intention to turn the platform (rebranded as X) into a "super app" with payment capabilities, with an official @XPayments account launching earlier this year.However, although Musk has long professed to be a fan of Dogecoin, the tech billionaire has not confirmed that the meme coin (or, indeed, any cryptocurrency) would form part of any planned payments feature.He has previously speculated that Dogecoin could be used as a means of payment for the social media platform's premium subscription service Twitter Blue, and has collaborated in the past with Dogecoin developers.Last year, the Financial Times reported that Musk wanted Twitter's planned payment service to be primarily based around fiat currency, but with the option of adding crypto functionality "at a later point," according to sources familiar with the matter.Edited by Stacy Elliott.Stay on top of crypto news, get daily updates in your inbox.

Over $1B in U.S. Treasuries (UST) Has Been Tokenized on Public Blockchains

The rapid rise in Treasury yields in the past two years has fueled demand for their tokenized versions. The 10-year yield, the so-called risk-free rate, has risen to 4.22% from 1.69% since March 2022, denting the appeal of lending and borrowing the dollar-pegged stablecoins in the decentralized finance market.

BlackRock: approval of the Ethereum ETF is possible

Yesterday, the founder and CEO of BlackRock, Larry Fink, stated that he believes it is possible to launch an ETF on Ethereum spot even if the SEC manages to declare ETH a security. 
He stated this during a live appearance on Fox Business.


BlackRock’s Ethereum ETF
BlackRock has not only launched on the US stock exchanges what is set to become the world’s largest Bitcoin ETF, but a few months ago it also filed a request with the SEC to launch an ETF on Ethereum spot.
Although BlackRock has a approval rating of over 99% for its ETF issuance requests, doubts are circulating about whether the SEC will approve it. 

The problem is that the SEC considers ETH an unregistered security, and therefore traded on US markets illegally. 
However, it is not the government agency that can decide whether an asset should be considered a security or not, so much so that a court last year ruled against the SEC itself, which claimed that XRP should be considered a security. 
Actually, the issue on XRP does not seem to be completely closed yet, both because XRP has been declared not to be an investment contract if purchased on the secondary market, but nothing has been decided yet for sales on the primary market, and because the lawsuit against Ripple is not yet over. Furthermore, in other similar cases, other judges have ruled differently.
However, so far no judge has yet expressed an opinion on whether ETH should be considered a commodity like Bitcoin, or an unregistered security.
ETH as security
The issue with securities is that in the USA they can only be legally sold after receiving approval from the SEC. 
ETH has not yet received this approval, also because it has never been requested. 
Until last year it was believed that Ethereum was a commodity like Bitcoin, but the switch to Proof-of-Stake with the introduction of staking has questioned this definition.
It is possible to imagine that in order to reach a final judgment from a judge, which is the only way to do it, the SEC will first have to reject the requests for the issuance of ETFs on ETH spot in the USA, leading to a court appeal by the applicants. 
For Bitcoin, on the other hand, something similar happened, because despite being clearly a commodity, the SEC initially rejected requests for the issuance of spot BTC ETFs in the USA. 
At that point Grayscale sued the SEC, and a judge ruled in favor of Grayscale and against the SEC, paving the way for the subsequent approval. 
By the end of May, the EC will necessarily have to pronounce itself on the requests for the issuance of ETFs on ETH spot, and at this point it seems likely that it will opt for an initial rejection, pending a subsequent explicit pronouncement by a court that clarifies the nature of ETH as a commodity or security. 
The role of BlackRock in approving the Ethereum ETF
It is worth noting that the situation regarding Bitcoin spot ETFs began to unlock as early as June of last year, just when BlackRock submitted its request. In fact, it was known that its approval rate for ETFs was over 99%. 
Later, the court ruled in favor of Grayscale at the end of August, finally resolving the issue. 
So yesterday’s words from Larry Fink seem like a way to anticipate the SEC’s moves.
In other words, it’s as if they stated that their request to issue an ETF on ETH spot on US exchanges will proceed even if the SEC refuses to approve it, using the excuse of considering ETH an unregistered security. 
Moreover, surely even in BlackRock they know very well that the SEC, in the midst of the electoral campaign for the November presidential elections, could opt for a rejection in May, but they also know perfectly well that the issue would only be resolved in front of a judge at that point. 
BlackRock has now thrown itself headlong into the crypto sector, even launching a tokenized fund on Ethereum.
It should not be forgotten that this is a real giant, a global giant that manages over $10 trillion in assets, making it the world’s largest asset manager. 
The price of Ethereum
In fact, the price of ETH, the native cryptocurrency of the Ethereum ecosystem, has not been particularly affected by the assumption that the SEC will likely reject the ETFs in May.
Shortly after mid-October, the price of ETH entered a bullrun phase, ending on March 13th. 
The price went from less than $1,700 to over $2,400 by the end of 2023, then rose to $2,700 in January 2024, and later to almost $4,100 on March 12. 
This is a remarkable -150% in less than five months, although there was a correction afterwards that brought it back to $3,000.
Currently it has risen to over $3,500, which is a value 115% higher than before the bullrun started. 
Interestingly, however, it has not yet managed to update the highs of 2021, when it reached nearly $4,900. On the other hand, the TFs are pushing mainly Bitcoin, and it will probably take a while before they can also push ETH.

BTC Whales Sell to TradFi; Analyst Predicts Price to Reach $77K


							

Old Bitcoin whales’ are selling to new institutional players, reshaping market dynamics.



Bitcoin may surge 10% to $77K if it holds above the $70K threshold.



BTC’s 24-hour trading volume has spiked by 25%, reaching $42.392 billion.




The market activity of Bitcoin has drawn attention as the changes in ownership patterns have become evident. On-chain data reveals that old established Bitcoin holders, known as ‘old whales,’ are transferring their Bitcoins to new institutional investors, implying a shift in market dynamics.



Notably, this movement of Bitcoin is happening between these large-scale holders, known as ‘whales,’ and not spreading widely among retail investors. On the same accord, a chart from analyst Axel Adler Jr., shared by Ki Young Ju, CEO of CryptoQuant, captures the shifting dynamics between investor classes. 







The chart specifically compares the supply and demand trends of new versus established Bitcoin investors over an extended period. This distinction between new and established investors is crucial, as it highlights the growing interest from traditional financial institutions in the crypto space.



Simultaneously, technical analysis from other sources, such as Ali Martinez, suggests that Bitcoin is on the verge of a bullish breakout. Observations of a ‘bull flag’ pattern on the 4-hour chart hint at a possible significant price surge. 







Based on this outlook, if Bitcoin’s price holds above the $70K level, it could experience an increase of around 10%, reaching a new all-time high of $77K. In tandem with the positive outlook for crypto, Bitcoin has gained a 1.23% rise during the previous 24-hour period.







BTC/USD 24-Hour Chart (Source: CoinMarketCap)



As of press time, Bitcoin’s price has reached $70.62K. This upswing comes despite the coin experiencing some volatility earlier in the week. Alongside the rise in its price, Bitcoin’s market capitalization has climbed by 1.32%, reaching a notable $1.389 billion. 



Complementing these gains, there has been a significant uptick in activity, as reflected by the 25.02% increase in intraday trading volume, which has surged to $42.392 billion, signaling heightened investor interest and market movement.

Indonesia to implement regulatory sandbox for crypto assets

The Indonesian Financial Services Authority (OJK) said that local financial services institutions offering new products and services must be included in the regulatory sandbox or leave room for testing upcoming innovations, including crypto asset products. According to a report by local Indonesian media outlet DetikFinance, once regulated and supervised, crypto assets will also need to go through a regulatory sandbox in the future. This means crypto firms in the sandbox stage will have to be evaluated by the regulator before being approved to operate in the country. Regulatory sandboxes are typically tools for businesses to test and experiment with new innovative products or services for a limited period.  Hasan Fawzi, the head of the country’s supervision of the financial sector technology innovation, digital financial assets and crypto assets, said that crypto assets have been included in the regulatory sandbox in an effort to eradicate fraudulent investments.  “I think this is our spirit at OJK, especially in consumer protection and education. We really hope that all of our regulatory mechanisms will be present and have a direct impact on preventing fraudulent investments.”Related: SBI expands Ripple remittance tech to banks in Vietnam, Indonesia, PhilippinesAs a part of this announcement, the OJK will take over regulation of the crypto industry starting in January 2025. Currently, it is under the jurisdiction of the country’s commodities agency, known as Bappebti. Indonesia classifies crypto assets as commodities, though when moved to OJK’s governance, it is speculated that they may be reconsidered as financial instruments. The crypto landscape in Indonesia has been heating up over the last year, with a pro-crypto candidate elected vice president in the most recent presidential elections. During his election campaign, Gibran Rakabuming Raka vowed to prepare blockchain, crypto, artificial intelligence (AI) and cybersecurity experts that would encourage local youth in the digital space.In 2023, the country launched its landmark national crypto exchange — the Indonesian Crypto Asset Futures Exchange — monitored by local regulators. It serves as the country’s sole platform for the legal exchange of digital assets. It has also begun conducting blockchain trials in public services. Earlier in March, Indonesian officials were reportedly considering changes to its dual taxation on crypto, urging a reevaluation of the country’s current 0.1% capital gains tax and 0.11% VAT on crypto transactions.Magazine: Owner of seven-trait CryptoPunk Seedphrase partners with Sotheby’s: NFT Collector

As Bitcoin (BTC) Halving Approaches, Analysts Shared Their Expectations! Here are the Details - Bitcoin Sistemi


As Bitcoin continues to attract the attention of investors worldwide, a new report from broker Canaccord Genuity highlights the potential for further bullish momentum in the cryptocurrency market following the upcoming halving event.
Canaccord Report Says Bitcoin Halving Could Boost ETF Momentum
According to the report released today, history suggests that an increase in Bitcoin and crypto market activity may be on the horizon in the months following the halving.


Canaccord analysts led by Michael Graham attribute the over 60% rise in Bitcoin (BTC) in the first quarter to several key factors, including the approval of spot exchange-traded funds (ETFs), the upcoming reward halving, and increased risk appetite in financial markets.
“While the macro outlook and timing of potential interest rate cuts remain uncertain, the upcoming halving event could contribute to significant upside for Bitcoin,” the report states.






Canaccord highlights the importance of the halving, which occurs approximately every four years and involves reducing miner rewards by 50%, thus reducing the Bitcoin supply. The next halving is expected to occur on April 21.
On the other hand, the report underlines that it is a positive development that the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) approved 11 US spot Bitcoin ETFs in the first quarter.


Canaccord predicts that this approval will continue to gain momentum, especially as individual investors look to add cryptocurrency exposure to Individual Retirement Accounts (IRAs) and other tax-advantaged accounts.

KuCoin Stays True to Its Motto “The People’s Exchange” With $10M Airdrop Compensation - Coin Edition


							

KuCoin CEO announced that the exchange will be airdropping $10M in BTC and KCS



FUD caused users to withdraw more than $1 billion from KuCoin



Lyu stated that KuCoin stayed loyal to its motto the “People’s Exchange”




CEO of KuCoin Exchange Johnny Lyu announced that KuCoin will be air-dropping $10 Million worth of KCS and BTC. In Lyu’s words: “To express our profound gratitude for your support and patience, KuCoin will launch a special airdrop event totaling 10 million USD in KCS and BTC”



In particular, this announcement comes after KuCoin was slapped with allegations from both the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission(CFTC). 



With the allegation against KuCoin, fear, uncertainty, and doubt (FUD) took the better of many users and as a result, KuCoin saw around $1 billion in crypto being withdrawn, causing a 20% drop in assets under management.



Addressing the issue and thanking the loyal users, the CEO of KuCoin stated in a blog post on their official website:




I would like to express my gratitude to all KuCoin users, for your support, trust, and companionship during the past few days, as well as the past 7 years. We will absolutely ensure the security of user assets as always and comply with regulations to fulfill our trust.,




Reflecting on compensation that KuCoin made in the past, Lyu stated, “In the early days of October 2017, at the very early stage of KuCoin, we made the unprecedented decision in the industry to proactively acquire and compensate users in large amounts due to the abnormal delisting of the CFD project.”



He further stated that this act of proactive compensation marked the origin of the title of “People’s Exchange” – a testament to the community’s original affirmation of KuCoin. He mentioned that they have always treasured this rare trust, and being “People’s Exchange” was their proudest label.



However, airdrops have their own set of problems. One of these problems is the threat of regulatory consequences.



The SEC, in its “Framework for ‘Investment Contract’ Analysis of Digital Assets,” stated: Just because digital assets are received for free, for example, being put into an “airdrop,” does not mean the investment of money requirement of the Howey test is not met; therefore, an airdrop can be considered a sale or distribution of securities.

Cardano architect slams ‘zombie blockchain’ allegations


Not long after an article came out describing multiple blockchains, including Cardano (ADA), Tezos (XTZ), Litecoin (LTC), Algorand (ALGO), Monero (XMR), Ripple, and others, as “zombies” with “few users,” Cardano founder Charles Hoskinson clapped back in his own style – with humor.
Apparently, an investigation by Forbes staff revealed that about 50 cryptocurrency platforms are “today trading at values of more than $1 billion, of which at least 20 are functional zombies,” according to the article that the popular media outlet published on March 27.
What did the report say?
Indeed, the report has slammed these blockchains and their crypto assets as “useless,” “good-for-nothing,” and with “little utility other than for speculative crypto trading,” boasting “treasuries brimming with millions” and answering “to neither shareholders nor regulators.”


In particular, Forbes writers had especially vicious criticism aimed at Cardano, which they argued had “brought in $3 million in fees last year, despite the Cardano Foundation itself saying it hasn’t yet completed its developmental stages,” as well as its founder, saying that:

“Hoskinson himself seems to be the main attraction. He owns an 11,000-acre ranch in Wyoming, funds self-described alien hunters and recently opened an anti-aging and regenerative medicine center in the town of Gillette. (…) He claimed to have dropped out of a math Ph.D. program (…), but the school says Hoskinson was an undergrad who didn’t complete his degree.”

Charles Hoskinson’s witty response
In response, Charles Hoskinson posted an animation featuring zombies from the hit series South Park, mentioning the other platforms called out in the article, including Bitcoin Cash (BCH), Stellar (XLM), and Ethereum Classic (ETC), saying Forbes was calling them zombies “because we got all the brains!”

As a reminder, this isn’t the first time that the media has accused Cardano of being dead, irrelevant, or failing, which its founder pointed out in August last year, sending a message to all the nay-sayers that “Cardano is here to stay,” as Finbold reported back on August 15, 2023.
In fact, the declarations of death have happened many times even to the crypto market representative and flagship decentralized finance (DeFi) asset Bitcoin (BTC), specifically 476 times since 2010, including as recently as February 2024, according to the data retrieved from 99Bitcoins.
Ultimately, the modern blockchain industry will unavoidably have plenty of critics, whether with well-founded or misplaced criticism, but also supporters who, nonetheless, should approach this market with caution and do careful research, including keeping up with Cardano news, before investing.

Fantom: Market Slowdown Chops off 10% From Gains, Here's Why


                            Leading the downturn today, Fantom (FTM) contributes to the 2% drop in the crypto market after weeks of growth.

Fantom is one of those altcoins that followed the broader momentum of the market. The latest market data shows that the token is down 10% in the past 24 hours, but is still on the green in the bi-weekly timeframe at 14%. However, Fantom has a trick up its sleeve to curb this brewing bearishness potentially. 
Fantom CEO Michael Kong Unveils Sonic Launch 
Sonic is the brand-new technology that the Fantom has been developing in the past 2 years. According to their latest blog post, Sonic was able to surpass the network’s 200 transactions per second metric. Although 200 TPS was already impressive compared to Ethereum’s 12 TPS, the network was quickly congested, and user experience deteriorated. 
Kong said in the blog post: 

“​​Sonic will be used to create a new best-in-class shared sequencer for L1 and L2 chains, capable of processing over 180 million daily transactions with real, sub-second confirmation times, and serve as the foundation to relaunch Fantom as an entirely new community-centric brand.” 

This brand-new tech will cover all parts of the Fantom network, from bridging to a stablecoin launch, Sonic has it all. 
Sonic Labs will also gain a slice of the pie as the foundation ultimately adds grant programs alongside the network upgrades. 

Bitcoin is now trading at $70.396. Chart: TradingView
“We will continue to significantly scale and accelerate our Sonic Labs grant program for developers who build unique and valuable applications and public goods in categories including gaming, DeFi, social media, streaming, and now distributed AI,” Kong added. 
This will significantly increase the size of Fantom’s user base, boosting investor confidence, and giving more room for developers to innovate. 
Furthermore, the advancements brought forth by Sonic Labs in covering all aspects of the Fantom network, from bridging to the launch of a stablecoin, are poised to have a notable impact on Fantom’s market dynamics.
By streamlining processes, enhancing interoperability, and introducing new functionalities, these developments are likely to enhance the network’s attractiveness to investors and users alike.


The Fantom Foundation X account announced today that Frax Finance Founder Sam Kazemain is the first angel investor for Sonic, stating that Frax will deploy natively issued assets on Sonic on its eventual launch.
Short-Term Gains Slashed In Favor Of The Long-Term
Meanwhile, the bears have completely taken over the FTM market in the short to medium term. Investors in FTM could only hope that the broader market downturn will reverse in the coming weeks.

Crypto Remains Under-regulated, FATF Chief Warns | Coinspeaker



Data detailed in a statistics report shows that less than 30% of jurisdictions globally have implemented the FATF crypto-targeted guidelines.

The Financial Action Task Force (FATF) has highlighted the need for comprehensive regulation in the crypto space. The message was conveyed in a recent interview granted by the FATF President T. Raja Kumar.
According to Kumar, the rallying call comes as a result of recent research into how global jurisdictions are responding to FATF’s recommendations for crypto regulation.




Data detailed in a statistics report shows that less than 30% of jurisdictions globally have implemented the FATF crypto-targeted guidelines. Essentially, this means that a significant portion of the crypto market continues to operate without oversight.
The report is named “Status of Implementation of Recommendation 15 by FATF Members and Jurisdictions with Materially Important VASP Activity”. FATF’s recommendation charges jurisdictions to clamp down on the criminal uses of crypto by licensing virtual asset service providers (VASPs). The agency also urges every jurisdiction to do a review of their business practices, products and technology.
As of publication, jurisdictions including Italy, France, and many more across Europe have aligned with FATF’s dictates. Although the recommendations are not mandatory, non-abiding jurisdictions face the potential risk of being isolated globally.
FATF Chief Sounds Alarm on Inadequate Crypto Regulation
Kumar spoke about the far-reaching implications of the lack of comprehensive regulation in the industry. Although he acknowledges the rapid growth and widespread adoption of cryptocurrencies globally, Kumar also noted that insufficient regulatory oversight creates grounds for risks, while also threatening the integrity of the financial system.
Interestingly, the negative effects of an unregulated crypto space do not end with investors alone. Law enforcement agencies also face challenges in combating illicit activities such as money laundering, terrorist financing, and fraud, which are often associated with cryptocurrencies. That is not to mention the constant uncertainty and hindrance to growth that legitimate crypto-based businesses may also experience as a result of unclear regulations.
The warning issued by the FATF chief underscores the urgent need for enhanced regulatory oversight in the crypto space. But more importantly, it also highlights the need for cooperation and cross-coordination among every stakeholder.
As cryptocurrencies continue to gain mainstream acceptance and adoption, regulatory authorities must prioritize the development of clear and comprehensive regulations. That is to ensure that the integrity of the financial system is kept intact while investors and consumers are also fully protected.
Looking forward, effective regulation will do two things for the crypto industry. Firstly, it will mitigate the risks that are linked with cryptocurrencies. It will also foster greater trust and confidence in the market, thereby encouraging responsible innovation and sustainable growth.

Let's talk Sam Bankman-Fried: What to expect from his sentencing | Cryptopolitan

Sam Bankman-Fried, the ex-FTX CEO, is on the edge of his seat as March 28 approaches. That’s the day he finds out if he’s walking free or starting a long stint in prison after being found guilty of seven serious crimes. Judge Lewis Kaplan of the New York Southern District is the man of the hour, listening to the last pleas for and against Bankman-Fried. This courtroom drama started with FTX’s crash in 2022 and followed with Bankman-Fried’s arrest, extradition, trial, and conviction.The Sentence DebateIn November 2023, a jury nailed Bankman-Fried for wire fraud, securities fraud, commodities fraud, and money laundering. His lawyers, hitting the ground running, asked for a 6.5-year jail time, arguing that the mess he caused only temporarily locked FTX investors out of their money.The prosecution, on the other hand, is pushing for 40 to 50 years, emphasizing the gravity of Bankman-Fried’s actions. The legal tussle focuses on how much money was actually lost when FTX went under, a key factor in deciding the sentence length.Legal eagle Mark Bini predicts a 30-year sentence, maybe even longer, considering the heated debate over the losses incurred. There’s a proposed plan to refund FTX users in cash, based on November 2022 crypto prices, but that means they’d miss out on any recent spikes in Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies’ values.An FTX user shared the devastation of losing their funds, highlighting the real-life impact of Bankman-Fried’s decisions. This case is charting new territory in dealing with high-profile digital asset figures facing trial and sentencing, with comparisons drawn to other notable cases like Ross Ulbricht of Silk Road and Elizabeth Holmes of Theranos.Comparing CasesBankman-Fried’s legal saga might not affect Changpeng “CZ” Zhao’s upcoming sentencing for a different type of crime at Binance, but Alex Mashinsky’s trial could feel some ripples, given the shared defense team and similar New York venue.As D-Day looms, there’s no word if Bankman-Fried’s family will be there to support him. The judge will weigh various factors, including the nature of his offenses and the financial damage inflicted on FTX’s customers and investors.The collapse of Bankman-Fried’s crypto exchange left an $8 billion hole and led to his conviction on several counts of fraud and money laundering. Despite the dire situation, FTX’s bankruptcy process has hinted at a possible full repayment to customers.Bankman-Fried’s defense argues that the financial harm to those involved is nil, attributing the $8 billion gap to a liquidity crisis amid a customer withdrawal frenzy. Moreover, ongoing restructuring talks suggest FTX could repay its customers significantly more than their initial claims, thanks to a rebound in crypto and AI asset values.Prosecutors dismiss these claims, highlighting that many customers won’t recover the real value of their deposits, as some cryptocurrencies have vanished. They also point out the enduring financial and emotional toll on FTX users, emphasizing that any future repayments won’t undo the immediate harm caused.Investors like Sequoia Capital are also staring down substantial losses, with their stakes now worth zilch. The final outcome depends on resolving claims and finalizing the bankruptcy plan, but Bankman-Fried’s actions have left a mark that won’t easily be erased.Legal experts are skeptical of Bankman-Fried’s defense swaying Judge Kaplan, noting the jury’s rejection of similar arguments. While some investors might have been more crypto-savvy, the notion that Bankman-Fried isn’t directly making victims whole is a sticking point.

Biden administration takes action to safeguard public from AI risks

The White House has unveiled its inaugural comprehensive policy for managing the risks associated with artificial intelligence (AI), mandating that agencies intensify reporting on AI utilization and tackle potential risks posed by the technology.According to a March 28 White House memorandum, federal agencies must, within 60 days, appoint a chief AI officer, disclose AI usage and integrate protective measures. This directive aligns with United States President Joe Biden’s executive order on AI from October 2023. On a teleconference with reporters, Vice President Kamala Harris said: “I believe that all leaders from governments, civil society and the private sector have a moral, ethical and societal duty to make sure that artificial intelligence is adopted and advanced in a way that protects the public from potential harm while ensuring everyone can enjoy its full benefits.”The latest regulation, an initiative by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB), aims to guide the entire federal government in safely and efficiently utilizing artificial intelligence amid its rapid expansion. While the government seeks to harness AI’s potential, the Biden administration remains cautious of its evolving risks.As stated in the memo, certain AI use cases, particularly those within the Department of Defense, will not be mandated for disclosure in the inventory, as their sharing would contradict existing laws and government-wide policies. By Dec. 1, agencies must establish specific safeguards for AI applications that could affect the rights or safety of Americans. For instance, travelers should have the option to opt out of facial recognition technology used by the Transportation Security Administration at airports.Related: Biden administration announces key AI actions after executive orderAgencies unable to implement these safeguards must discontinue using the AI system unless agency leadership can justify how doing otherwise would heighten risks to safety or rights or hinder critical agency operations.The OMB’s recent AI directives align with the Biden administration’s blueprint for an “AI Bill of Rights” from October 2022 and the National Institute of Standards and Technology’s AI Risk Management Framework from January 2023. These initiatives emphasize the importance of creating reliable AI systems.The OMB also seeks input on enforcing compliance and best practices among government contractors supplying technology. It intends to ensure alignment between agencies’ AI contracts and its policy later in 2024.The administration also unveiled its intention to recruit 100 AI professionals into the government by the summer, as outlined in the October executive order’s “talent surge.”Magazine: Real AI use cases in crypto: Crypto-based AI markets, and AI financial analysis

BlackRock CEO’s ETF comments boosts Ethereum (ETH) and Algotech (ALGT)



                    

                    
BlackRock CEO Larry Fink believes a spot Ethereum ETF is possible even if SEC designates ETH a security.
Markets are upbeat amid this outlook despite current weakness.
Meanwhile, investors eyeing new gems have identified new token Algotech (ALGT).

BlackRock CEO Larry Fink has noted his bullish stance on Bitcoin, with the global asset management behemoth seeing massive uptake for its iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) spot Bitcoin ETF. Fink is also optimistic about a spot Ethereum ETF.
What does this mean for Ethereum price? Elsewhere, why is the new decentralized trading platform Algotech (ALGT) attracting so many investors to its presale?
Larry Fink on potential spot ETH ETF
In comments on Wednesday, BlackRock CEO Larry Fink said that designating ETH a security won’t be “deleterious”, noting that an ETH ETF was still possible.
Various analysts have noted that a spot Ethereum ETF nod from the SEC is unlikely in May. 
However, Fink’s comments align with the broader anticipation that this will eventually get an approval. As such, the BlackRock CEO’s remarks saw a slight flip for Ethereum and other altcoins late Wednesday.
Ethereum price rose slightly to above $3,658. However, it remains choppy amid recent news around the Ethereum Foundation.
The outlook was similar across the altcoin market, except for Dogecoin and Bitcoin Cash.
DOGE and BCH were seeing double-digit gains, perhaps helped by the anticipated Coinbase listing of Dogecoin and Bitcoin Cash futures trading on April 1, 2024. 
Crypto traders are eyeing the futures listing. Interest in new crypto project Algotech is also rising.
Why is Algotech (ALGT) attracting investors?
The crypto world offers multiple opportunities, particularly in the trading space. However, many people around the world are unable to tap into this due to various reasons. One of these is the complexity of the trading market.
Algotech is a new trading platform that seeks to level the playing field, tapping into AI and machine learning to open up opportunities for everyone.
The algorithmic crypto trading platforms offer intelligent trading strategies. The AI-powered platform removes the limitations associated with manual trading, including limited analytics, inconsistency in execution and human emotions and biases.
All these factors make crypto trading on traditional platforms largely unappealing for the ordinary user. Algorithmic platforms change this.
Advanced algorithms allow for real-time access and analysis of markets, datasets and trends. Leveraging the automated platform means users can make informed decisions related to the opportunities available.
With Algotech, users will tap into speed and efficiency, data-driven decision-making and real-time market data. It’s one platform likely to change the crypto trading landscape big time.
Should you buy ALGT today?
The token powering the Algotech ecosystem is ALGT.
According to the Algotech whitepaper, the total supply of ALGT is 350 million. 70% of this is available in presale. The project has raised over $3.3 million from early investors so far, with more than 84.9 million tokens sold.
For a project likely to dominate given its robust technical infrastructure, tokenomics, roadmap and future dominance, the sub-cent presale prices might offer a great entry point.
Currently, the presale is in stage 2, which is 92% sold out with ALGT price at $0.06. Presale participants can access a 20% promotion bonus on all deposits in this stage. Meanwhile, the next stage will see ALGT price rise to $0.08.

Hashing It Out: Can blockchain create a sovereign internet?

A week after experiencing an internet blackout in his country, Hashing It Out host Elisha Owusu Akyaw looks for answers on how blockchain technology can create a more sovereign internet in an interview with the co-founder of XYO Network, Arie Trouw. The episode also covers data sovereignty and the importance of privacy in the ever-evolving internet landscape. The conversation between Owusu Akyaw and Trouw explores new issues like elections and fake news, and how blockchain tech could be used to verify the authenticity of information on social media. Trouw explains that the sovereign internet is based on that idea of the original version of the internet (Web1) but with the functionalities of Web2 and Web3. On a sovereign internet, users own their own data set, tools and services, which they can share with other users without needing a central server or third-party authority. “So the sovereign internet is really, to some degree, a step back from Web2 to Web1, where each party has their own services and their own peer-to-peer functionality that they share with somebody else. And the internet works the way it’s meant to be, where it’s resilient to outages.” With major elections taking place worldwide in 2024, issues like fake news and artificial intelligence-generated deep fakes threaten to widen the polarization in society.Trouw concedes that blockchain may not be the answer to the problem since dealing with fake information on the internet requires the average person to be a skeptic and have the desire to verify everything they read. However, when society develops a culture that seeks to verify the credibility of information, Trouw believes that blockchain technology would be the ultimate method to authenticate the origin of information on the internet. The rest of the podcast explores more use cases of blockchain technology in creating a better internet by using location data and how blockchain technology could play a role in identifying aliens.

                        Western Europe has emerged as a leading region in global crypto adoption, attracting a substantial number of daily traders, ranging from 1.2 million to 1.5 million individuals.According to a new research from Bitget, Germany and France are at the forefront of activity in the region, while Austria has experienced the most significant yearly growth, witnessing a remarkable 70% surge in users. Germany closely followed with a 69% increase, while other Western European countries demonstrated slower growth rates ranging between 15% and 20%.When compared to other regions, Western Europe benefits from a clearer level of compliance, the report said. Countries such as Germany, Switzerland, Belgium, France, Austria, Liechtenstein, Luxembourg, and the Netherlands adhere to the legislative framework established by the European Union for regulating crypto assets.Spot Trading Dominates Trading in Western Europe
Centralized exchanges and spot trading dominate the cryptocurrency trading landscape in Western Europe. Users in Germany, Switzerland, and the Netherlands exhibit a preference for trading futures, while other countries lean towards spot trading.Centralized exchanges attract the majority of daily traders, with centralized exchange (CEX) traffic surpassing decentralized exchange (DEX) traffic by a factor of 10. Among those opting for decentralized platforms, PancakeSwap and Uniswap emerge as the most popular exchanges. Coinbase Wallet, Metamask, Bitget Wallet, and TrustWallet are the preferred cryptocurrency wallets across the eight countries.Over the past year, centralized exchange traffic from Western European users has experienced significant growth, particularly in Germany, Switzerland, and Poland. Germany and Switzerland saw a year-over-year increase of over 50%, while Poland witnessed a growth rate of 145%. However, France and Belgium exhibited slower growth rates, with Belgium even experiencing a 6.8% decline compared to the same period last year.DeFi Accounts for Majority of Crypto Activity in Western Europe
Decentralized finance (DeFi) usage constitutes the majority of cryptocurrency activity in Western Europe, while peer-to-peer (P2P) trading volumes remain relatively low. The prevalence of purchasing digital assets using fiat deposits or linked cards contributes to the limited adoption of crypto P2P trading in the region. In contrast, regions like Southeast Asia rely more on P2P transfers as the primary instrument for cryptocurrency trading.Regarding asset choices and trending topics, Western European traders actively participate in decentralized projects, show familiarity with DEX tools and trading, engage with NFTs and Web3 platforms, and demonstrate interest in popular chain ecosystems like Solana. Emerging cryptocurrencies such as Ordinals, NFTs, RWAs, DePin, Solana ecosystem tokens, and meme coins have gained significant attention among traders in Western Europe throughout the year.“The Bitget research suggests that cryptocurrency participants in the region typically possess a high level of education, exercise caution, and prioritize long-term investments,” the report wrote. “Additionally, a significant portion of local users actively engage in both online and offline forums, including community Ask Me Anything (AMAs), where they exchange market insights and discuss industry trends.”Another recent survey has revealed that nearly 50% of European cryptocurrency holders owned Bitcoin in February.

ONDO, MKR are 'profitable' - These numbers will tell you why - AMBCrypto



ONDO’s price surged as interest in the Real World Asset sector grew.
MakerDAO continued to dominate the space, with the highest TVL accrued.

Ondo Finanace [ONDO] has seen a massive uptick in price over the last week, largely owing to the behavior of whales concerning this token. However, new data suggested that this uptick could be part of a larger trend.
Welcome to the Real World
The sudden interest in ONDO could be driven by the interest in the RWA (Real World Asset) sector. For context, the RWA sector in crypto stands for Real World Asset tokenization. It bridges the gap between traditional finance and crypto by creating digital tokens representing real-world assets like real estate, commodities, or even intellectual property.
This allows these assets to be bought, sold, and traded on a blockchain platform, potentially increasing their liquidity and accessibility for investors. It’s seen as a way to modernize traditional financial markets by leveraging the transparency and efficiency of blockchain technology.
Ondo Finance has emerged as the fourth-largest holder of Blackrock’s Ethereum-based tokenized fund, BUIDL, boasting holdings totaling $15 million.
Thanks to the endeavors of ONDO and similar protocols, the total tokenized US Treasuries on public blockchains have reached $1 billion. Within a mere week, Blackrock’s BUIDL saw an astonishing surge of 400%, skyrocketing from a supply of 40 million to 240 million.

Don’t forget about Maker
Apart from Ondo Finance, other networks such as MakerDAO[MKR] have also been showing large amounts of growth. At press time, MakerDAO had the largest amount of TVL (Total Value Locked) collected on its network.
It was the leader in the space and despite the protocol’s considerable resources, the price of the MKR token had declined by 7.28% over the past month.
Source: DeFi Llama
Due to the vast difference between the value collected by RWA protocols and their market cap, market speculators believe that these tokens may be undervalued.

Realistic or not, here’s MKR’s market cap in BTC’s terms

At press time ONDO was trading at $0.9011 and its price had grown by 0.84% in the last 24 hours. MKR on the other hand was trading at $3,353.13 and its price had grown by 3.64%  during the same period.
Most of the holders of these tokens were profitable as suggested by their high MVRV ratios. Only time will tell whether these addresses will sell their holdings or continue to hold them going forward.

Ethereum Network Hits Record High of 1 Million Validators with $114B Staked | Coinspeaker



Ethereum now has more than 1 million validators, with more than 26% of Ether’s total supply currently staked in pools.

The number of validators on the Ethereum network has hit 1 million, a new high for the blockchain. In total, the validators have staked 32 million Ether, worth around $114 billion at current market prices.
According to data from Dune Analytics on Thursday, the validator count is exactly 1,002,400, with precisely 32,076,797 ETH staked. This translates to 26.74% of the entire ETH supply.




Lido Has the Highest Number of Validators
The Dune Analytics dashboard also displays further information, including showing Lido as the Ethereum staking pool with the highest volume of staked tokens, at 30%, with more than 9.6 million ETH staked, and 302,000 validators. Coinbase is in the second position with 14%, 4.5 ETH and 141,000 validators, while Binance is the third-largest but well below Coinbase. Binance has 39,000 validators who have staked 1.24 million ETH, 3.9% of the total supply.
Validators are necessary for the function of proof-of-stake (PoS) blockchains. Essentially, they validate transactions, create new blocks, and are responsible for network security and consensus. Each validator must stake a minimum of 32 ETH. Unsurprisingly, Lido has the largest market share because it allows users to participate collectively instead of each one single-handedly meeting the 32 ETH minimum.
Ideally, the number of validators suggests an increase in blockchain security. However, venture investor and former Ethereum Chief Decentralization Officer, Evan Van Ness believes that there is “already too much staked”.
Last September, Ethereum developers decided to change a Dencun upgrade code relating to validator set size growth. They considered this necessary because over time, there have been issues and warnings about the effect of a large volume of the validator set size. For instance, when developers were testing the Holesky testnet, they discovered that at 2.1 million active validators, the testnet could not finalize.
According to Ethereum Foundation DevOps Engineer Parithosh Jayanthi, network attestations were between 40% and 50% even when block proposals hit 80%. Jayanthi said attestations only grew to the 82% to 84% range when developers reduced the testnet size from 2.1 million to 1.4 million.
Restaking Spikes Volume of New Ethereum Validators
Last month, the number of validators on queue hit 7,045, the highest since October 6. At the time, the backlog was for 225,000 ETH, about $562 million. The backlog resulted from Ethereum’s restriction of the number of validators allowed to join the network per epoch – the block creation duration, which is about 6.4 minutes. The number on the queue later increased to 9,000.
The large number of validators on the queue may be because of restaking, which allows staking already-staked ETH to boost rewards. The staked ETH in one pool, like Lido, can be restaked on another platform for additional yield.
While staking increases network security, concerns about validator control were recently raised after a large number of validators made a heavy ETH withdrawal amounting to about $320 million.

Crypto Influencer EmperorBTC Advises Followers To Buy The Dip If Bitcoin Dumps To $65K Again - What Are Analysts Saying? - Benzinga

With nearly 400,000 followers on X, crypto influencer EmperorBTC has achieved success by offering market insights and Bitcoin (BTC) trading analysis to his community. EmperorBTC is one of many influencers on X who continually post content about Bitcoin's future. While there are some valuable insights, some of the content can be directed at an echo chamber of Bitcoin bulls. For this reason, it's important to consider many different analysts' opinions on Bitcoin. Don't Miss:Take a look at what EmperorBTC has been saying about Bitcoin. The influencer recently posted on X:1. If Bitcoin Dumps to $65K again, it will be time to buy the dip even harder. Buy everything you have belief in.2. The halving is not priced in. No one is giving it enough attention. It’s automatically bullish.3. It’s time to deploy your time, sleep and capital season.The controversial point in the post comes from the halving. There is lots of debate around whether the event is priced in, meaning that the price of Bitcoin already reflects the known impacts of the halving. There are reasonable arguments on both sides. JPMorgan Chase & Co. analysts believe the halving is already priced in, saying that BTC could go as low as $42,000. "This $42,000 estimate is also the level we envisage bitcoin prices drifting towards once bitcoin-halving-induced euphoria subsides after April," JPMorgan analysts wrote. They also mention that the halving will lower mining profitability, which could have negative effects on Bitcoin's price. On the other side of the debate, analysts see Bitcoin continuing to rise in 2024. Fundstrat's Tom Lee said that Bitcoin will reach "$150,000 before year end … and much much higher numbers in the future." Lee has experience with financial markets and crypto, so this prediction carries some weight.Additionally, Standard Chartered is also bullish on the token, projecting it to reach $100,000 by the end of 2024 and $200,000 by the end of 2025. Both Standard Chartered and Lee believe that the halving will reduce selling pressure and allow the price of Bitcoin to surge.The halving will reduce the number of new Bitcoins minted each day from around 900 to 450. Some miners take these newly minted tokens and sell them each day, which can help keep prices lower. With fewer tokens, there could theoretically be less selling activity. JPMorgan and others see the situation differently. They believe that the halving is already priced in or that it will lead to a large selloff. This would lead Bitcoin's price to either trade sideways or fall after the halving. EmperorBTC's opinion is that the halving will be positive for BTC. If he is correct, now would be one of the last times to get into an investment for a solid price. If he is wrong, an investment in BTC right now could fare poorly. Bitcoin is extremely unpredictable, especially with the novelty of current market dynamics.Read Next:

Veteran Bitcoin Whales' On-chain Antics Spark Intrigue - Who's Gaining?

CryptoQuant CEO Ki Young Ju highlights an intriguing Bitcoin trend spotted via on-chain data: old whales are selling Bitcoin to new whales (TradFi), not retail investors.Veteran Bitcoin whales, referring to early adopters with vast quantities of the currency, are beginning to sell off their holdings. But contrary to what one might expect, it is not the retail investors who are the primary beneficiaries of this sell-off. Instead, a new class of whales has emerged from the traditional finance sector (TradFi), and they are the ones scooping up the Bitcoin being shed by the old guard. One of the classic patterns observed during Bitcoin bull markets is a transfer of wealth from old to young. Investors who accumulated BTC at lower prices several months or years ago prefer to increase their distribution pressure as new ATHs are reached.Julio Moreno, CryptoQuant's head of research, reported an incident along these lines that saw an early BTC miner, probably from the Satoshi era, shift 2,000 BTC. Moreno added that these coins were mined in 2010 and were all transferred to a single address that was newly created.Similarly, CryptoQuant noted in a recent analysis, referencing Bitcoin Realized Cap Hold Waves, that in recent months, short-term Bitcoin holders have accumulated significant amounts of Bitcoin. Based on this metric, short-term holders now account for 50% of the realized Bitcoin cap.Shift in dominanceBitcoin reached an all-time high of $73,750 on March 14. At the time of writing, BTC had risen 1.17% in the previous 24 hours to $70613, down 4.29% from its recent all-time highs.According to on-chain analytics firm Glassnode, a market rally to new all-time highs coincides with a shift in dominance, in which funds held by new investors and speculators surpass those held by longer-term HODLers.As Bitcoin reached its ATH, Glassnode reports that $2.6 billion in realized profit were locked in through on-chain spending. Nearly 40% of this profit-taking can be attributed to the long-term holders, which include investors divesting from the GBTC Trust.

QuadrigaCX Co-Founder Grilled by British Columbia Authorities, Here's Why



Records submitted to the British Columbia Supreme Court indicate that Michael Patryn is suspected of having obtained the assets illegally. 

The British Columbia (BC) government recently filed an unexplained court order, seeking to seize assets belonging to Michael Patryn, co-founder of the defunct crypto exchange QuadrigaCX.
Authorities Move to Seize QuadrigaCX Co-Founder’s Assets
The director of Civil Forfeiture in B.C. explained in a report that the seizure targets a quarter-million dollars in cash, 45 gold bars, luxury watches, and jewelry contained in a safety deposit box belonging to the co-founder.




Records submitted to the British Columbia Supreme Court indicate that Michael Patryn, who was once involved with Gerald Cotten in establishing QuadrigaCX, is suspected of having obtained the assets illegally.
B.C. Solicitor General, Mike Farnworth highlighted that the recent move by B.C. authorities is the third instance that an unexplained wealth order has been issued in British Columbia since amendments were made to the Civil Forfeiture Act. Simply explained, unexplained wealth orders require individuals to explain the origins of their wealth and assets, especially where criminal conduct is suspected.
“Through this action, we are demonstrating again that criminals will have to prove that their assets are the proceeds of lawful activity and not financial crime,” Farnworth explained.
After Cotten’s unexplained death in India in 2018, the exchange, which had millions of investor funds under management, experienced turmoil. His passing accelerated the discovery of almost $215 million in missing investor funds, causing QuadrigaCX to file for bankruptcy under a court order in 2019. A subsequent investigation conducted by the Ontario Securities Commission later ruled that QuadrigaCX was not merely a failed business venture but a fraud and Ponzi scheme.
In June 2021, authorities seized a safety deposit box linked to Michael Patryn at a Vancouver-based CIBC branch. Among the items seized were $250,200 in Canadian currency,  luxury timepieces, 45 gold bars from Australia and Canada, a variety of jewelry, and numerous identity documents linked to different aliases.
It is estimated that QuadrigaCX defrauded approximately 76,000 customers. The exchange’s bankruptcy trustee, Ernst & Young (EY), was only able to collect $46 million of the $215 million owed to investors. Last year, a law firm representing users of the defunct crypto exchange said it would begin an interim distribution of cash related to the trading platform’s bankruptcy proceedings.
Implications of Civil Forfeiture to QuadrigaCX
Civil forfeiture, a legal procedure in place in British Columbia since 2006, allows the province to recover assets without filing criminal charges. This option allows police to dismantle criminal enterprises and recover proceeds from illicit activity.
In the instance of QuadrigaCX, where thousands of investors were left in financial ruin, seeking justice through civil forfeiture is viewed as a critical step in dealing with the consequences of the fraudulent operation. The QuadrigaCX case serves as a reminder of the dangers of unlicensed cryptocurrency exchanges and the necessity of strict regulation in the nascent field of digital assets.

D-Wave Quantum Inc. (NYSE: QBTS), a trailblazer in commercial quantum computing systems, software, and services, recently unveiled its financial achievements for the fourth quarter and the conclusion of the fiscal year 2023.



The company’s CEO, Dr. Alan Baratz, heralded this period as a testament to D-Wave’s undeniable momentum, underscored by remarkable commercial traction, significant product advancements, and the establishment of pivotal strategic partnerships.According to Dr. Baratz, these accomplishments are steering D-Wave to fortify its standing as the pioneering force and commercial leader in quantum computing.



D-Wave Reports $2.9 Million in Q4 Earnings, Up 21% Year-Over-Year



The financial highlights for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2023 reflect D-Wave’s success. The company reported a 21% year-over-year increase in revenue, amounting to $2.9 million, marking the third consecutive quarter of sequential growth. Bookings for the same period exhibited a 34% rise from the previous year, totaling $3.1 million and representing the company’s seventh consecutive quarter of year-over-year growth in this metric. Moreover, D-Wave’s gross profit surged by 45% to $2.0 million, and its GAAP gross margin expanded significantly to 67.7%, both indicators of the company’s robust financial health and operational efficiency.





D-Wave Misses on Revenue Expectations in Q4



When juxtaposed with market expectations, D-Wave’s fiscal achievements underscore the company’s capacity to outperform and drive growth. Analysts had projected an earnings per share (EPS) of -$0.11 and revenue of $4.69 million for the quarter. Although D-Wave’s revenue fell short of these projections, its EPS of -$0.10 per share reflected a narrower loss than anticipated, demonstrating the company’s improving profitability trajectory.



The company’s effective management of operating expenses, which decreased 17% year over year, along with a notable advancement in adjusted EBITDA, further illustrates D-Wave’s adeptness at surpassing expectations through strategic financial stewardship.



D-Wave Expects $4.3 Million in Bookings for Fiscal Q1



Looking ahead, D-Wave has set ambitious targets for the first quarter of fiscal 2024, aiming for at least $4.3 million in bookings. This goal signifies a minimum of 36% growth over the fourth quarter of fiscal 2023 and a 47% increase from the first quarter of the previous fiscal year, signaling the company’s eighth consecutive quarter of year-over-year growth in quarterly bookings. D-Wave’s projection for the full fiscal year 2024 anticipates an Adjusted EBITDA Loss of $54.3 million, less than the fiscal 2023 Adjusted EBITDA Loss of $54.3 million, highlighting the company’s ongoing efforts to refine its profitability and operational efficiency.

BlackRock CEO Remains Confident on Ethereum ETFs, Says IBIT Is The Fastest-Growing ETF


																In a recent interview on FOX Business, BlackRock CEO Larry Fink shared his insights on the potential for an Ethereum exchange-traded fund (ETF) amidst regulatory scrutiny.
Despite concerns over a possible designation of Ethereum as a security by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), Fink expressed confidence in the feasibility of launching such an ETF.
SEC’s Stance on Ethereum Raises Doubts
BlackRock and several other ETF providers have submitted applications for a spot Ethereum ETF to the SEC. However, there are doubts regarding the agency’s approval of these ETFs as the May deadline approaches.
When asked about the SEC’s stance on ETH possibly being classified as a security, Fink refrained from providing detailed commentary but remained optimistic. “But I don’t think that designation is going to be too deleterious,” Fink stated, suggesting that such a designation wouldn’t necessarily hinder the creation of spot Ethereum ETFs.
It was recently disclosed that the SEC is exploring the classification of Ethereum as a security and has issued subpoenas to three companies for details regarding the Ethereum Foundation, a Swiss nonprofit important to the growth and advancement of the blockchain. This development has raised concerns about the possibility of launching an Ethereum ETF in the United States.




On the other hand, analysts in the field are sharing differing opinions. Bloomberg’s ETF experts James Seyffart and Eric Balchunas have voiced doubts, pointing to the SEC’s minimal interaction with filings as worrisome. However, Craig Salm has countered this argument, suggesting that the SEC’s lack of engagement shouldn’t necessarily signal the approval outcome.
Fink Bullish on Bitcoin
Despite these challenges, Fink remains optimistic about Ethereum’s and Bitcoin’s long-term prospects. BlackRock is not only pursuing an Ethereum ETF but also operates one of the most successful spot Bitcoin funds, the iShares Bitcoin Fund (IBIT), which has amassed over $17 billion in assets under management since its approval in January.


IBIT is the “fastest-growing ETF in the history of ETFs,” Fink stated on Fox Business. He also said he is “very bullish on the long-term viability of Bitcoin. We’re creating now a market that has more liquidity, more transparency, and I’m pleasantly surprised and would have never predicted it before we filed it that we were going to see this type of retail demand,” he added.

                        SHIB has gained by 5% in the past 24 hours, as the Shiba Inu price moves to $0.00003204 on a quiet day for the crypto market as a whole.This moves means that SHIB has recorded an 18% return in a week and a 205% increase in the last 30 days, with the meme token’s trading volume rising beyond $1.5 billion today.Such a volume indicates a spike in demand for SHIB, potentially coming from whales who expect the token to rally further in the coming weeks.And with the market enjoying a lift in recent days, today could be the beginning of a productive period for Shiba Inu.Shiba Inu Price Prediction as $1.5 Billion Trading Volume Floods In – Are Whales Buying?
SHIB’s chart looks pretty bullish today, with the coin showing plenty of momentum that could continue for another one or two days yet.Its relative strength index (purple) has jumped to 70 in the past hour, rising from under 50 yesterday.Source: TradingViewThis signals a big shift in buying pressure, which also finds reflection in SHIB’s 30-day average (orange), which has begun rising again in the last few hours.What’s also promising is that Shiba Inu’s resistance (red) and support (green) levels have been rising in parallel this week, suggesting that the coin’s price will occupy an increasingly high range in the near term.On top of this, SHIB’s 24-hour trading volume has increased by around 125% since Monday, rising from $700 million to about $1.7 billion.Again, this shows that whales may be moving to SHIB in the expectation that the meme token has some substantial gains to make in the coming weeks and months.And given that SHIB is still some 62% down from its current ATH ($0.00008616), it has plenty of room for big gains.Such gains could come as the wider market gains speed, with analysts expecting prices to rise as we move towards next month’s Bitcoin halving.The market is also likely to become increasingly bullish in response to expected Federal Reserve rate cuts, which will increase investor appetite for risk-on assets such as cryptocurrencies.This includes Shiba Inu, which remains one of the strongest meme tokens in the market in terms of its fundamentals.The Shiba Inu price could therefore reach $0.00004 in the next few weeks, before making a climb towards $0.00005 and higher by the summer.New Meme Tokens Bring Greater Volatility
The only issue with SHIB is that, as a well-established meme coin, the days of its astronomical gains are most likely over.Traders wanting exponential returns will therefore have to look elsewhere, with several newer meme coins looking like they could fill the void.A good case in point is Slothana (SLOTH), a Solana-based meme token that has raised just over $1.2 million in its presale.This figure is highly impressive in light of the fact that it opened its sale only a few days ago, and it provides an indication of how popular SLOTH is becoming among investors.It has styled its memes after the lovable sloth, a representation of how it expects to make traders big profits with a minimum of effort.Its launch comes at a time when demand for Solana-based meme coins has been sky-high.For example, the recently listed Pundu raised just over $100 million in its presale, while DogWifHat has gained by just over 200,000% since listing in December.SLOTH is clearly trying to tap into such a market, and while it’s still very, its ability to raise over $1 million in just a couple of days is a very good sign.VIDEOInvestors can get involved in its presale by going to its official website, with the coin available at a price of 1 SOL for 10,000 SLOTH (or roughly $0.019393 per coin).It’s also worth pointing out that its team was also responsible for Smog (SMOG), which rallied enviably earlier this year after listing.SLOTH may therefore replicate such performance, making its early investors a sizeable profit.Visit Slothana Now

Final Bitcoin Options Expiry Before Halving Is Here-What You Need to Know - Decrypt

Approximately $15 billion worth of Bitcoin open interest contracts expire tomorrow—the last monthly expiry ahead of the next BTC halving—across derivatives exchanges CME, Derebit, OKX, Binance and Bybit, according to CoinGlass.For Derebit, this March 29 expiry accounts for roughly 40% the $26.3 billion worth of total Bitcoin open interest on the platform—"one of the biggest in Derebit's history," the exchange said on Twitter.The groundswell of institutional interest and deepening liquidity signaled by current open interest can't be overstated. Ahead of the last Bitcoin halving, which occurred on May 11, 2020, open interest had only reached $2 billion.Now, ahead of the 2024 halving, the BTC market is seeing unprecedented levels of open interest in options and futures. This hints at a highly sophisticated and liquid market. Institutional participation has grown, helped massively by the introduction of spot Bitcoin ETFs in January. The anticipation surrounding the halving and its potential impact on supply and price dynamics is more pronounced than ever.Open interest is a measure of the nominal value of derivatives contracts, like futures and option. Traders use them to bet on the future price movements of an asset, like BTC and stocks, or commodities, like grains and gas.And the swell of open interest points to crypto traders feeling especially bullish during these final weeks ahead of the next Bitcoin halving, which currently looks to be taking place in 23 days on Saturday, April 20.After every 210,000 blocks have been processed on the Bitcoin network, the reward paid to miners is cut in half—which is where the Bitcoin halving name comes from. It's an anti-inflation measure that increases the scarcity of BTC roughly every four years and usually also kicks off a price rally.But it hasn't always been easy to gauge how traders are feeling about the halving with open interest. The first Bitcoin futures platform, ICBIT, emerged in 2011, but didn't attract much market attention. So when the first Bitcoin halving occurred on November 28, 2012, BTC was still very much an experimental technology with a small investor base.By the time the second halving occurred on July 9, 2016, the Bitcoin ecosystem had evolved. BitMEX had started offering BTC derivatives in 2014 and introduced perpetual swaps in 2016. And not long after, traditional finance mainstays CBOE and CME began offering Bitcoin derivatives in December 2017—marking the first time crypto derivatives were being traded on U.S. regulated exchanges.The CBOE and CME entry came at an especially significant time in the market. The 2017 bull run had just taken BTC on a ride from $1,000 in January to $20,000 in December.But when the third halving occurred on May 11, 2020, investors were still in the grips of a global pandemic that seemed to underscore Bitcoin's appeal as "digital gold." This was the first time that substantial open interest in Bitcoin futures and options signaled deepening market liquidity and a broader investor base. Institutional interest had started to pick up as the Bitcoin market capitalization exceeded $1 trillion for the first time.Even so, the current open interest is seven times larger than the $2 billion worth of open contracts ahead of the 2020 Bitcoin halving.Stay on top of crypto news, get daily updates in your inbox.

Data shared by the @spotonchain analytics X/Twitter account shows that a smart whale has sold a large Ethereum chunk. It included a lot of dormant ETH coins acquired when the second largest cryptocurrency traded below the $700 zone.Dormant ETH coins bring whale $10 million in profitThe tweet reveals that this whale (wallet ending in 0xf2b) has dumped all of his Ethereum – 17,768 ETH, selling it for 62.24 million DAI. The aforementioned amount of Ethereum is equal to a massive $63,655,281 in fiat. That is a ROI of more than 400%, the tweet states. @spotonchain also revealed that a lot of the coins sold by this whale were purchased by him from centralized exchanges Gemini and Bittrex between 2018 and 2021, when ETH traded approximately at $679 – an estimated cost of almost $10 million.Debates about Ethereum ETF continueRecently, Bloomberg’s ETF analyst Eric Balchunas stated that the odds of the SEC greenlighting spot Ethereum ETFs have plunged to merely 25% and became less likely, taking a pessimistic turn.There is less than a month now before the deadline for VanEck’s ETF application arrives but, according to the aforementioned Bloomberg expert, there are hardly any communications between the regulator and ETF issuers who have filed their applications, BlackRock among them. Another reason for believing in a great delay on Ethereum ETF approvals is the fact that getting a green light for spot Bitcoin-based ones took years.Still, BlackRock boss Lary Fink recently stated that he believes that approval of spot Ethereum ETFs is still possible, even if the SEC eventually classifies Ethereum as a security. So far Ethereum, along with Bitcoin, has been named a commodity, but recently discussions begun to emerge, which question this decision by the SEC regarding Ethereum.Within the past 24 hours, Ethereum has demonstrated a rise of 3.70%, reaching $3,585. However, until that price increase happened, ETH saw a 5.19% decline from the local high of $3,667.

                        Singaporeans are increasingly viewing Bitcoin in a favorable light, thanks to the recent approval of spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) in the United States.According to a new report from the digital currency exchange Independent Reserve, 39% of Singaporeans have expressed a more favorable view of Bitcoin following the approval of spot Bitcoin ETFs. There is also a high awareness of the US SEC’s approval of spot Bitcoin ETFs among Singaporeans, with 51% of respondents indicating their knowledge of this development. Furthermore, 33% of participants are open to investing through an overseas offering since retail investors in Singapore do not have access to such products.Crypto Investors in Singapore Plan to Increase BTC Holdings
As the Bitcoin halving event approaches in April, 48% of crypto investors in Singapore plan to increase their Bitcoin holdings over the next 12 months. The report noted that this sentiment is particularly strong among those who already hold more than 50% of their portfolio in cryptocurrencies, with 68% intending to further increase their Bitcoin investments.When given a choice, 75% of Singaporeans prefer to invest directly in Bitcoin through a cryptocurrency exchange rather than using a Bitcoin ETF. The reasons cited for this preference include lower fees and a wider range of trading options available on cryptocurrency exchanges.“The long-awaited arrival of spot Bitcoin ETFs has supercharged the demand side for Bitcoin as billions of dollars from institutions have poured in,” Lasanka Perera, CEO of Independent Reserve Singapore, said. “The trust and understanding of Bitcoin have grown significantly over the past few years, and more Singaporeans are increasing their allocations.”The Independent Reserve Cryptocurrency Index (IRCI) for Singapore scored 56 this year, reflecting a positive shift in public perception toward cryptocurrencies. While overall awareness and ownership of cryptocurrencies may have slightly decreased, other key metrics suggest growing confidence and optimism in the market.Singaporean Crypto Investors Are Becoming Experienced
The study also revealed that Singaporean cryptocurrency investors are becoming more experienced. More than half (52%) have been in the market for over three years, and their portfolios are becoming increasingly diverse, with 16% now holding six or more different cryptocurrencies.Meanwhile, diversification remains a primary motivation for Singaporean crypto owners, with 52% investing in cryptocurrencies to expand their investment portfolios. Despite market volatility, 53% of respondents plan to invest more in their existing portfolios, while 45% expressed an interest in diversifying into new projects.Experienced investors, those with over five years of market experience, engage in frequent trading, with 61% trading at least once a week compared to newcomers. This year, 64% of crypto owners reported making profits, a significant increase from previous years, while only 10% experienced losses.More than half of the respondents (55%) believe that cryptocurrencies will be widely accepted by businesses and the general public, with 35% of non-crypto owners sharing this belief as well.A recent report by Seedly and Coinbase, conducted in the fourth quarter of 2023 and encompassing over 2,000 adults, found that 57% of respondents currently hold digital assets.The majority of respondents said they have invested between US$1,000 and $25,000.

Crypto is ‘too big to ignore’ for the charitable sector

Cryptocurrency adoption in the charity space is growing quickly, with 56% of the top 100 charities in the United States now accepting crypto donations as of January 2024, according to the 2024 annual report from crypto charity organization The Giving Block. This marks a huge turnaround for nonprofits, many of which were initially hesitant to adopt crypto payments.As the report states, “When we launched The Giving Block in 2018, we had to practically bust down doors to get nonprofits to talk to us about bitcoin.”The report adds, “A lot has changed since then.”Cointelegraph spoke with the Giving Block co-founder Alex Wilson to discover how attitudes are shifting and whether he expects to see charitable organizations trend toward greater crypto adoption in the future.“Yes, over time, we continue to see greater adoption of nonprofits accepting cryptocurrency donations,” said Wilson. “The market has become too big to ignore. There aren’t many markets in the world that allow a nonprofit to tap into a $2 trillion donor base.”Wilson believes knowledge and familiarity with cryptocurrency are key to this change.“Most of it is a matter of education. Many nonprofits just don’t realize how many people own cryptocurrency. Yet once they realize that, they come around to it pretty quickly,” he said.Keeping crypto donations simpleTo onboard as many charities as possible, the Giving Block aims to make it simple for charities to accept crypto donations. Part of that comes in the form of an auto-sell feature, which transfers crypto into dollars at the point of donation.“If they’d like, they can opt to hodl, but most are more comfortable liquidating the donations, similar to how they treat other non-cash donations like stock or other forms of property. Our goal is to make taking crypto just as easy as taking any other gift a nonprofit gets,” said Wilson. With this in mind, using a donation solution minimizes a nonprofit’s exposure to cryptocurrency. Recent: Ethereum Dencun upgrade lowers transaction fees for L2s“The main pitfall is trying to do too much without knowing what they’re doing,” said Wilson. “Some nonprofits have opted to take things on themselves rather than work with a trusted partner.”According to Wilson, it “doesn’t usually end well” for those who try to go it alone.Trusted partners: Streamlining adoptionSave the Children, a nonprofit focused on improving the lives of children worldwide, began accepting Bitcoin (BTC) in 2013 after Typhoon Haiyan struck the Philippines.Ettore Rossetti, head adviser for technology, marketing and innovation partnerships at Save the Children, told Cointelegraph that the path to accepting crypto donations wasn’t wholly straightforward, requiring several sign-offs from various departments before the initiative could move forward.“I secured the proper legal, financial and media communications permissions to be able to accept that Bitcoin donation,” said Rossetti, who admitted “there were concerns” centered around matters such as environmental impact.Even with those concerns, Rossetti managed to secure all necessary approvals within 24 hours, proving that where the will exists, progress can be very swift indeed. Having used various trusted partners from 2013 onward, Save The Children is now one of the many nonprofits working with The Giving Block. Many of its programs have benefited from the generosity of crypto donors.For example, in Afghanistan, crypto donors helped support humanitarian assistance for 730,000 children in the chaotic aftermath of the U.S. withdrawal.Following the 2023 earthquake in Syria and Turkey, crypto donations helped fund Save the Children’s water and sanitation program, reaching 1.1 million children and 2.6 million people in total.In Uganda, in cooperation with World of Women, Save the Children raised $100,000 — helping to meet the educational needs of 115,000 children and adolescents.Crypto’s troubled reputationAlthough crypto and charitable giving are becoming increasingly close-knit, there are still challenges ahead. The mainstream media isn’t always kind to the blockchain industry, and nonprofits must remain mindful of their reputation.Then there are figures such as U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren who associate the crypto industry with illicit activity. We asked Wilson what impact figures like Warren have on the industry.“It’s frustrating since Elizabeth Warren and other politicians have often used exaggerated or outright false data to support their claims,” said Wilson. “Luckily, the facts support us, and the evidence is clear that there is much less illicit activity than people like Elizabeth Warren claim. All the data points to there being less illicit activity in crypto than there is in the traditional economy.”Rossetti said that one thing Save the Children had to actively consider was the environment and “the reputational risk associated with issues such as energy utilization, especially proof-of-work chains like the Bitcoin blockchain.”Recent: Bitcoin halving hype: How retail investors can prepareFor Rossetti and Save the Children, the environment is something they are continually mindful of since climate change “exacerbates the problems facing children — more natural disasters and so on.”“We are the world’s first nonprofit to be part of the Green Climate Fund and the only children’s charity. So, we’re proud of that. We only have one planet,” said Rossetti.“But in looking at it more closely, just beyond headlines, many of the blockchains are powered by renewable sources or underutilized energy. And therefore, that essentially tends to be overblown.”Crypto for good: #HODLhopeSave the Children’s latest drive for crypto samaritans is #HODLhope. As the campaign states, “Around the world children are being robbed of their futures by a global economy built on inequality and greed. [...] Save the Children believes that blockchain technology and cryptocurrencies can be a force for good and a force for financial inclusion.”The aim of #HODLhope is to raise $10 million in crypto donations by the end of 2024, allowing children around the world to hold on to hope. Having raised nearly $8 million by March, the campaign looks sure to attain that.For the 44% of the top 100 U.S. charities that have yet to awaken to the power of Bitcoin and cryptocurrency more generally, now may be the time to take note.

QuadrigaCX founder could be forced to explain where he got his Rolex


Canadian authorities are petitioning courts to force QuadrigaCX co-founder Michael Patryn to explain how he came to be in possession of 45 gold bars, a diamond-studded Rolex watch, and more than $250,000 in cash.
As reported by Bloomberg, the Director of Civil Forfeiture in British Columbia has asked for a court order that would force Patryn to explain the assets which were seized in June 2021 two years after Quadriga’s collapse.
A 2020 investigation concluded that the exchange’s 2019 implosion was caused by fraudulent activity committed by the exchange’s other founder, Gerry Cotten. Cotten died in mysterious circumstances while on his honeymoon in 2018.
The probe also found that Patryn cut ties with QuadrigaCX after 2016 before the majority of the fraudulent activity took place. However, according to the most recent filing, chat records from 2014 and 2015 appear to show the founders discussing how they could appropriate customer funds and make it look as though Patryn had left the company.

In a previous filing, Patryn’s legal team claimed that the seized assets had no connection to any illegal activity. The latest application will be heard by a judge on April 30.
According to British Columbia’s solicitor general Mike Farnworth, if Patryn cannot or will not adequately explain how he came to own the cash and jewelry, he may be forced to forfeit them and see them donated to victims of crime and crime prevention services.

Bybit crypto exchange launches trading platform in the Netherlands

Bybit, one of the world’s largest cryptocurrency exchanges by trading volumes, is expanding operations in Europe after facing regulatory scrutiny in Hong Kong.On March 28, Bybit officially announced the launch of its digital asset platform, Bybit.nl, in the Netherlands. The new local trading platform is regulated in the country and designed to provide Dutch users access to cryptocurrency trading and education resources.The launch of Bybit.nl is enabled through collaboration with Satos, one of the oldest Bitcoin (BTC)-focused companies in the Netherlands. Through the partnership, Bybit’s Dutch users can deposit and withdraw fiat currency and trade over 300 pairs.Bybit’s launch in the Netherlands aims to further the company’s commitment to serving users while upholding regulatory compliance, Bybit co-founder and CEO Ben Zhou said. He added:“Through our partnership with SATOS, we aim to provide Dutch users with a secure and seamless trading experience, backed by industry-leading security measures and unparalleled support.”According to some local reports, Bybit was discontinuing some of its services in February 2024. The exchange specifically shut down derivatives services in the Netherlands in compliance with guidelines by the Dutch central bank. “The first changes to the new regulations will be effective from March 5,” Cryptotag’s head of communications Indy Rottier wrote in a LinkedIn post on Feb. 20.According to Rottier, other major global exchanges like Binance and Gemini were forced to terminate their operations in the Netherlands to comply with local laws in 2023.Cointelegraph approached Bybit for a comment regarding the Bybit.nl launch but had yet to receive a response at the time of publication.Related: Philippines to block Binance exchangeThe news comes a few weeks after Hong Kong’s Securities and Futures Commission (SFC) issued a public warning against Bybit on March 14. The regulator elaborated that Bybit offered crypto-related products in a number of jurisdictions without holding a license.“The SFC is concerned that these products have also been offered to Hong Kong investors and wishes to make it clear that no entity in the Bybit group is licensed by or registered with the SFC to conduct any ‘regulated activity’ in Hong Kong,” said the regulator.Established in 2018, Bybit is one of the world’s largest crypto exchanges. According to data from Kaiko, Bybit’s daily spot trading volume peaked at $4.3 billion on March 4, ranking the second biggest exchange after Binance, which reached nearly $24 billion in volumes on that day.Magazine: ‘SEAL 911’ team of white hats formed to fight crypto hacks in real time

Ethereum's Rising Validator Count Is Causing Concerns, Fidelity Digital Assets Says

The rapidly rising validator count on the Ethereum blockchain following the Shapella upgrade in April last year is causing concerns about technical capacity and centralization, Fidelity Digital Assets wrote in a research report on Thursday.

Fidelity noted that “with the lowered risk from increased liquidity, the active validator count has risen by 74%,” and said “future roadmap upgrades will become more difficult” with this larger set.

The Shapella upgrade enabled withdrawals, for the first time, for validators who staked their ether (ETH) to secure and validate transactions on the blockchain.

A large validator count is a concern because “bandwidth and latency are critical in a large validator set network, where each validator must independently download the latest data and verify state change proposals within a small time frame,” analyst Daniel Gray wrote, adding that “the larger the block (data), the more computing power needed to process and re-execute the transactions before the next slot.”

Every new validator adds a further connection to the network which increases the overall bandwidth that is needed to maintain consensus, the note said.

“The potential concern is that as the bandwidth requirements grow, the validators that are unable to keep pace will drop from the network - those that drop are more likely to be the self-hosted nodes,” Gray wrote. “If the average household struggles to keep up with the network, there is a risk of increased centralization over time, as the only hardware to survive may live within institution-owned data centers,” he added.

While the growth in the size of the validator set has slowed recently, it's unclear what the situation may be in a year from now, the report said; “therefore, the possibility of rapid growth could be a problem due to centralization and bandwidth risks.” 

The challenge of an expanding validator count has always been viewed as a “good problem” as it represents increased adoption and security for the Ethereum blockchain. Still “it is impossible to accurately predict the staking demand in the future,” the report added.

                        KuCoin, a cryptocurrency exchange, has announced an airdrop of Bitcoin and its native KuCoin (KCS) token, totaling $10 million, to their loyal customers, despite recent US DOJ charges.KuCoin CEO Johnny Lyu announced the news in a letter published on the exchange’s blog. The move comes amid legal challenges and charges filed by the United States Justice Department against the exchange and its founders.KuCoin CEO Expresses Gratitude to Users, Announces Special Airdrop EventOn March 27th, KuCoin’s CEO, Johnny Lyu, expressed gratitude to the exchange’s user base in a letter posted on the exchange blog. Despite recent challenges, including withdrawal delays on March 26th and 27th, Lyu emphasized KuCoin’s commitment to ensuring the security of user assets and complying with regulatory standards. He thanked users for their support and trust during this tumultuous period.Lyu mentioned that since their intervention, KuCoin’s mission has been to grow alongside the crypto industry and promote global recognition, acceptance, and affection for the sector. He drew parallels between the airdrop and the exchange’s past initiative to reimburse investors affected by the Confido rug pull.The CEO explained that some users experienced withdrawal delays due to high volumes, possibly from cautious customers withdrawing from the exchange. To show appreciation for users’ support and patience, KuCoin will initiate a special airdrop event totaling $10 million in KCS and BTC. Lyu highlighted that this proactive compensation marked the origin of the title “People’s Exchange,” reflecting the community’s affirmation of KuCoin. He said,“This act of proactive compensation marked the origin of the title “People’s Exchange”—a testament to the community’s original affirmation of us. We have always treasured this rare trust, and being “People’s Exchange” is our proudest label.”While Lyu did not directly mention the legal issues faced by the exchange, the airdrop serves as a token of gratitude to loyal users who stood by KuCoin during its challenging period. Detailed rules for the airdrop will be released in three days, ensuring transparency and clarity for users.KuCoin and Founders Indicted by U.S. Justice Department for Unlicensed Money Transmission
The timing of the airdrop is noteworthy, given the current legal actions against KuCoin. On March 26, United States Justice Department officials charged KuCoin and two of its founders with “conspiring to operate an unlicensed money-transmitting business” and violations of the Bank Secrecy Act, or BSA.The U.S. Department of Justice said KuCoin founders Chun Gan and Ke Tang had willfully failed to maintain an anti-money laundering program at the exchange, leading to the platform being used for “money laundering and terrorist financing.” According to the Justice Department, KuCoin received over $5 billion and sent over $4 billion of “suspicious and criminal funds.” The Commodity Futures and Trade Commission (CFTC) also charged KuCoin with multiple violations of the Commodity Exchange Act. The CFTC is seeking to impose fines and trading bans, while the DoJ is seeking forfeiture and to pursue criminal penalties.Following the Department of Justice’s filing of charges, KuCoin saw more than $1 billion worth of crypto withdrawals from the platform, which caused a 20% drop in assets under management. Nevertheless, the exchange comforted its customers, saying that all systems are running smoothly and the user funds are safe.Although popular in the crypto community, the concept of airdrops carries its own risks, especially from a regulatory standpoint. The “Framework for ‘investment contract’ Analysis of Digital Assets by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has outlined that airdrops might still satisfy the criteria of investment of money under the Howey test.

BlackRock's Larry Fink says Bitcoin's spot ETF is the fastest growing ETF in history | Cryptopolitan

BlackRock’s big boss Larry Fink just threw a piece of knowledge that’s got everyone talking. On a sunny day on Fox Business, he didn’t just chat about the weather but dropped a bomb about Bitcoin that’s echoing across the financial world. The word is out. BlackRock’s Bitcoin ETF, known as $IBIT, is smashing records left and right, becoming the champ of ETF growth speed in the history of the world. Now, that’s not something you hear every day. Fink’s confidence in Bitcoin isn’t just a passing cloud. He’s all in, betting on the cryptocurrency’s bright future. It’s not just a hunch; he’s seeing a tsunami of retail demand that’s turning the market into a more liquid, transparent beast than ever before. This isn’t your everyday financial forecast; it’s a bold statement from the helm of the world’s largest asset manager. And when Fink speaks, people don’t just listen; they take notes.Unprecedented Growth Sparks InterestLet’s cut to the chase. The explosion of BlackRock’s Bitcoin ETF is more than just impressive stats; it’s a signal, loud and clear, that Bitcoin is becoming a big deal in the investment world. The reasons? Think inflation jitters, economic roller coasters, and the hunt for something solid in a sea of financial uncertainty. Bitcoin, with its cap on how much exists and its freedom from central control, is looking pretty good as a safe haven and a spicy addition to investment portfolios.As $IBIT skyrockets, it’s not just about the numbers. Fink backing Bitcoin throws a huge dose of credibility into the crypto ring. Institutional eyeballs are turning towards Bitcoin, seeing it not just as digital gold but as a legit slice of a savvy investment strategy. This isn’t just another day at the stock market; it’s a glimpse into a future where Bitcoin plays a starring role.Let’s not forget the price tag on Bitcoin itself. After a bit of a rollercoaster, it’s on the up again, touching the sky at $71,500. And with Fink hinting at a possible climb to $80,000, all eyes are on the prize ahead of the Bitcoin halving. The air is electric with “what ifs,” as Bitcoin ETFs pull out of a slump and head for new heights.A New Era for Bitcoin InvestmentNow, onto the heavyweight facts. Since getting the green light from the SEC, BlackRock’s been on a shopping spree, scooping up 243,627 Bitcoins. Do the math, and you’re looking at $17 billion worth of digital gold. That’s a whole lot of Bitcoin, growing by the day, with sights set on hitting $22.6 billion by April’s end. If that doesn’t scream “momentum,” what does?This week alone, Bitcoin ETFs have seen a cash influx of $348 million. Just a week ago, things were looking a bit gloomy with a massive $800 million heading out the door. But the tide’s turned, with a fresh batch of Bitcoin worth nearly half a billion dollars making its way into ETFs. It’s a rollercoaster that’s going up, with Fink’s bullish outlook fueling the fire for Bitcoin’s ascent.The market’s buzzing, and Bitcoin’s potential to breach $80,000 is more than just cocktail chatter. It’s a possibility backed by hard cash and a growing investor appetite. And while some might worry about a bit of resistance around the $72,000 mark, Fink’s words have the power to turn holders into HODLers, paving the way for Bitcoin to not just hit new highs but to redefine them.There you have it. Clearly, we’re witnessing history in the making.

Stran & Company, Inc. Reports Record Q4 Sales of $23.3 Million - Tokenist


					
Neither the author, Tim Fries, nor this website, The Tokenist, provide financial advice. Please consult our website policy prior to making financial decisions.



Stran & Company, Inc. (NASDAQ: SWAG) has recently released its financial outcomes for the fourth quarter and fiscal year ending December 31, 2023, showcasing a remarkable boost in sales and profitability.



The Quincy, Massachusetts-based marketing solutions provider reported a 27.5% year-over-year sales increase for the fourth quarter, totaling approximately $23.3 million.



This surge in sales marks the highest quarterly revenue in the company’s history. Moreover, Stran achieved a gross profit of roughly $8.7 million during the same period, representing a substantial 63.5% increase from the previous year and pushing the gross margin to 37.4%.



The company’s operating income also saw a significant rise, with a 156.1% increase reaching approximately $1.1 million, coupled with net earnings of $883,000 for the fourth quarter of 2023. These figures reflect Stran’s enhanced operating efficiency and economies of scale, solidifying its position in the market.



Stran & Company’s Diluted $0.03 EPS Misses Expectations in Q4



Compared to the expectations set for the quarter, Stran & Company’s performance did not exceed analysts’ forecasts. The anticipated earnings per share (EPS) were pegged at $0.04, with revenue expectations at $27.1 million. The company’s revenue fell slightly short of projections, the basic EPS of $0.05 surpassed estimates, but the diluted EPS of $0.03 fell short of expectations.



This discrepancy underscores Stran’s ability to maintain a robust margin and operational leverage despite the challenges posed by purchasing costs and the integration of recent acquisitions. The positive variance in EPS can be attributed to the company’s focused efforts on enhancing sales and marketing strategies and the successful assimilation of acquired assets, which contributed significantly to the bottom line.





Stran & Company Provide Optimistic Guidance, Plans to Nurture Organic Growth



Stran & Company has provided guidance reflecting optimism for the continued growth trajectory. The company’s strategic acquisitions, including adding T R Miller Co., Inc. and others in the past two years, have broadened its geographical reach and bolstered warehousing and manufacturing capabilities.



Stran is keen to nurture its organic growth further while optimizing the synergies from its acquisitions. With an eye on expansion, the company is actively exploring further mergers and acquisitions opportunities.



Stran’s initiatives towards improving sales and marketing, including enhanced SEO and demand generation efforts, are expected to impact the contract pipeline positively. The company also boasts a solid balance sheet, with approximately $18.5 million in cash and investments as of the end of 2023.

Let's Break Down Vitalik Buterin's Latest Essay | Cryptopolitan

Vitalik Buterin, the brain behind Ethereum, dropped a thought bomb on the crypto community, challenging us to rethink what we know about decentralization. He’s not one to shy away from the tough topics, and this time, it’s no different. Buterin is throwing down the gauntlet, suggesting we might be doing decentralization all wrong. He’s proposing a wild idea: make the crypto world a fairer place by slapping bigger penalties on those who mess up in a way that screams, “I’m gaming the system.” Rethinking Penalties: A Game Changer for DecentralizationButerin’s not just talking out of his hat here. He’s got a plan, and it’s all about making big players sweat a little when they screw up. Right now, in Ethereum land, if you mess up, you get a slap on the wrist, a penalty. But here’s where Buterin turns the tables: what if the more you and your clone army mess up together, the more you pay?It’s like saying, “Oh, you thought you could outsmart the system by being everywhere at once? Think again.” This idea isn’t new to Ethereum, where they’ve already got some of this smart thinking in the slashing and inactivity leak mechanics. But Buterin’s saying it’s not enough. We need to dial it up for the everyday mistakes too, not just the once-in-a-blue-moon mega fails.He’s got the numbers to back it up. Buterin and co. have been crunching the data, looking at when validators are supposed to do their thing and when they actually do it. They’re also peeking into who’s who in the Ethereum zoo, linking validator IDs to the big names like Lido, Coinbase, and yes, even Buterin himself. The results? When validators in the same crew are supposed to attest at the same time and don’t, it happens way more than it should by sheer chance. This isn’t just bad luck; it’s a pattern.Buterin’s deep dive into the data shows us that, yes, these big validator clusters are messing up together more often than they should. It’s like they’re all tripping over the same cable. If things were really decentralized, these failures wouldn’t be so… cozy. They’d be all over the place, not huddled together, whispering, “Oops, we did it again.”Crunching the Numbers: The Buterin WayLet’s get into the nitty-gritty of how Buterin suggests we fix this. Imagine every slot in the Ethereum blockchain is a little contest, and if you miss more slots than the average, you start to rack up penalties. But here’s the kicker: these penalties grow the more you and your buddies miss together. It’s a way to say, “Play fair, or pay up.” And this isn’t just theoretical. Buterin ran the numbers, and the results are pretty telling. The more this penalty system is put into play, the less advantage the big guys have. Suddenly, being a behemoth with a zillion validators doesn’t look so hot.But what’s really going on here? Well, in the grand scheme of things, the total number of misses is pretty small. But for a big player, even a few misses can skew the numbers because they have so many validators. This means they can single-handedly bump up the failure rate for a slot, which, in turn, bumps up their penalties. It’s a self-own of epic proportions.So, could a big staker just spread out their validators to avoid these penalties? Sure, but then they lose their economies of scale, which is a fancy way of saying, “It’s gonna cost you.” And that’s the beauty of Buterin’s proposal. It’s a subtle nudge to big players, saying, “Maybe don’t put all your eggs in one basket.”

ChatGPT now helps you backtest simple trading strategies


ChatGPT, an artificial intelligence (AI) language model developed by OpenAI, has released a new tool designed to simplify the process of backtesting trading strategies. 
In a thread published on their X (formerly Twitter) account, on March 27, Pedma, a library of trading strategies, outlined a 6-step process. They utilized ChatGPT to backtest a simple moving average (MA) crossover strategy for Bitcoin (BTC) rather than a ChatGPT trading bot.
Here’s a breakdown of the key components:


ChatGPT Python 
In the first step, the user requests ChatGPT to provide Python code for importing the required libraries for backtesting a trading strategy, with a focus on data handling from Yahoo Finance and visualization. 
By providing the necessary tools right away, ChatGPT saves time and makes it easier for traders to turn their ideas into reality.
Data retrieval from Yahoo Finance
After setting up the initial libraries, Pedma asked ChatGPT how to get data. They wanted to know how to get historical Bitcoin price data (daily OHLC and volume) in Python, starting from January 1, 2020. 

With ChatGPT’s help, users can easily get important info like daily prices and trading volume. 
This means traders can focus on understanding market trends and improving their strategies without wasting time looking for data themselves.
ChatGPT trading strategy
In the third step of the process, Pedma asked ChatGPT to help define a trading strategy using the available Bitcoin data. Specifically, they requested guidance on creating a MA crossover strategy in Python using the ‘pandas tool.’ 
By offering clear guidance on strategy definition, ChatGPT enables traders to develop structured approaches to market analysis, which can help them make smarter decisions when dealing with the market.
Implement the backtest
Once the strategy was defined, Pedma inquired about implementing the backtest using Python and pandas to assess the strategy’s performance. 
They asked ChatGPT how to execute this step to analyze how well the strategy would perform in real market conditions. 
This step helped Pedma understand the effectiveness of their trading idea and its potential to succeed in the market.
Analyze the results and visualize
After completing the backtest, Pedma wanted to see the results and make a graph to show the returns. They asked ChatGPT how to do this using pandas and matplotlib.

Their goal was to understand the important numbers from the backtest and visualize the equity curve to show how the strategy worked with Bitcoin data.
Python code knowledge will help
In the final step, Pedma noticed a problem with the drawdown chart — it wasn’t showing the right data. So, they had to manually fix it to make sure it displayed the correct information. 
While ChatGPT automates much of the process, basic Python knowledge is still recommended. 
More complex strategies might require manual code adjustments, especially for accurate visualization.

Solana's stellar performance shakes up the Altcoin market

The surge by Solana (SOL) has been accompanied by more than 850% over the past year, yielding much better rewards. Six months ago, CRO was trading at around $21; after spearheading this more recent bull run, CRO has now captured a price of over $200, which leaves its competitors like Ethereum, Cardano, and Chainlink with only moderate gains. Solana’s dominance in the Altcoin marketOver this period, Ethereum and Cardano ascurred increased over 100%, while Chain link inscribed the gain of 200%. This remarkable role has also led to debates among the market players, including investors and analysts, on what tendencies may shape the future of this market. This remarkable role has also led to debates among the market players, including investors and analysts, on what tendencies may shape the future of this market.Against this background, the notorious Cardano supporter, Dan Gambardello, has recently spoken about Cardano’s current place amongst altcoins. Using the market data, Gambardo pointed out Solana’s unique growth rate, and this is the case of only coins, which managed to expand even faster than Bitcoin. Interestingly, he believes that Solana’s latest development is somewhat uncharacteristic but not completely without parallel.Bringing up the previous bull market analogy, Gambardello related to Chainlink’s tremendous gains before the Bitcoin halving event 2020, where the asset recorded lows of up to 1000% rise. Nevertheless, Chainlink’s vibrant performance in the events that followed the halving has been compacted in Gambardello’s forecasts, which cautiously indicate that Solana’s status may also change along this line.Gambardello’s inferences are not limited to historical exemplifications but provide a larger picture, which he explains will appear soon after the Bitcoin halving. He points out that Solana’s heightened presence in the digital currency world does not necessarily mean that the remaining crypto options will cease to be widely accepted. On the other hand, Gambardello believes this scenario would lead to adjusting the market balances, which would allow other anonymous cryptocurrencies to step forward.A changing game for altcoinsThe discussion surrounding Solana’s ascendancy and its implications for the altcoin market is multi-faceted. Gambardello’s comments shed light on the cyclical nature of the cryptocurrency market, suggesting that current market trends may not indicate long-term outcomes. His analysis implies that while Solana’s performance is noteworthy, it does not necessarily preclude other altcoins from experiencing significant gains in the future.This perspective is crucial for investors and market observers as it underscores the importance of looking beyond immediate market movements to understand underlying trends and potential shifts in market dynamics. As the Bitcoin halving approaches, the anticipation of an altcoin season offers a glimmer of hope for currencies that have yet to match Solana’s explosive growth.Moreover, Gambardello’s analysis serves as a reminder of the inherent unpredictability of the cryptocurrency market. Past performance, while informative, is not always a reliable predictor of future results. This unpredictability necessitates a balanced investment approach, where understanding the broader market context and potential catalysts for change is as important as analyzing individual asset performance.Solana’s remarkable surge in the cryptocurrency market has ignited discussions about the future of altcoins. While its dominance is undeniable, the insights provided by market analysts like Dan Gambardello suggest that the game is far from over for other leading cryptocurrencies.

Dogecoin Soars 17% To Break $0.21 As Volume Explodes


                            Dogecoin has jumped 17% in the past 24 hours to break past the $0.21 barrier as on-chain data shows a significant increase in volume for the memecoin.
Dogecoin Beats Market With 17% Rally In The Last Day
Most of the top cryptocurrencies have seen flat returns in the last 24 hours, but Dogecoin has gone its own way as the original meme coin has enjoyed a strong rally.

The below chart shows what the asset’s performance has looked like during the last few days:

The price of the coin appears to have sharply soared over the past day | Source: DOGEUSD on TradingView
In this latest rally, Dogecoin has surged more than 17% in the last 24 hours and has cleared the $0.21 level. Among the top 100 cryptocurrencies by market cap, only Bitcoin Cash (BCH) has registered comparable profits in the same period.
DOGE still beats BCH in the 1-week timeframe, however, as the memecoin has managed returns of more than 40% in this period, while the Bitcoin hard-fork has seen 33%.
The reason behind these two assets in particular seeing a strong performance may lie in the fact that Coinbase plans to add futures products for them starting the 1st of April. Litecoin (LTC) is also set to see a listing on the same day, but its performance has been much weaker than the other two.
In terms of market cap, Dogecoin is currently the eighth-largest coin in the sector, as the table below shows:

Looks like the market cap of the memecoin is just under $31 billion at the moment | Source: CoinMarketCap
From the table, it’s apparent that the gap to USD Coin (USDC) in seventh isn’t too much right now, so if Dogecoin can keep up its surge, it’s possible that it may be able to flip the stablecoin.
DOGE Transaction Volume Has Observed A Sharp Increase Recently
Something that would confirm that widespread speculation around Dogecoin is ripe for a rally currently would be its Transaction Volume. As a user on X pointed out using data from the on-chain analytics firm Santiment, DOGE’s Transaction Volume has shot up recently.
The “Transaction Volume” keeps track of the total amount of tokens (in USD) for a given cryptocurrency that has observed some movement on the blockchain in the past 24 hours.
When the value of this metric is high, it means that the users are transacting large amounts on the network right now. Such a trend implies the trading interest around the asset is high currently.
On the other hand, low values of the indicator can be a sign that the general interest in the cryptocurrency, both as an asset and a network, is low at the moment.

Now, here is a chart that shows the trend in the Dogecoin Transaction Volume over the past year:

The metric seems to have gone up in recent days | Source: @trader_kamikaze on X
As is visible in the chart, the Dogecoin Transaction Volume has experienced quite a boost recently, and what has accompanied this rise has been the latest rally.
A rising volume can often be a positive sign for the sustainability of any rally, as it means that interest in the asset is going up, and thus, more fuel is potentially coming in.
Something to keep in mind, though, is that selling and buying alike affect this indicator, so a mass selloff would also register as a spike in the metric. Thus, while high volumes are usually a requirement for rallies to continue (as without interest, the run can easily die down), they alone can’t predict a further rise, as the nature of this activity can be hard to ascertain.

Solana Future Clouded By Coinbase-SEC Ruling: Crypto Lawyer


								On Wednesday, the future of Solana may have been clouded by United States Southern District of New York’s Judge Katherine Polk Failla with her decision against Coinbase’s motion to dismiss. The ruling enables the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to advance its case against the crypto exchange giant. The case centers on allegations that Coinbase has been operating as an unregistered exchange, broker, and clearing agency, and its Staking Program constitutes the unregistered offer and sale of securities.
Solana (SOL) Is A Security: Judge Failla
The implications of this ruling extend far beyond Coinbase, striking a chord, particularly with the Solana community. The judge’s mention of SOL (and Chilliz (CHZ)) in the context of the lawsuit highlights the SEC’s position that both crypto assets are securities. Notably, the agency only has to prove that at least one of the 13 named tokens is a security, and Judge Failla specifically chose SOL (and CHZ) as an example to agree with the SEC’s arguments.

Bill Morgan, a pro-XRP lawyer, offered a detailed commentary on the ruling via X (formerly known as Twitter), drawing attention to the critical examination of SOL. Morgan stated, “One of these was Solana. She found that the SEC plausibly asserts that Coinbase facilitated transactions in crypto-asset ‘securities’. She clearly found that the SEC had plausibly argued sales of SOL were securities and did not accept sales on secondary markets were not securities.”
This observation underscores the heightened regulatory scrutiny and potential reclassification risks facing Solana and similar tokens. Morgan added, “It is a setback for Coinbase and does not look good for SOL sales not being found to be investment contracts. Seriously, if Coinbase was consistent in its reaction to the filing of the SEC v Ripple case in delisting XRP it would now delist SOL.”
In her ruling, Judge Failla detailed SOL’s operational history and its efforts to raise capital, thus framing the context for its potential classification as a security. “SOL” is described as a crypto-asset that is the native token of the Solana blockchain, a network designed to support decentralized applications (dApps) and characterized by its high transaction speeds and scalability.

The judge noted, “To raise capital, Solana Labs conducted a series of initial offerings of SOL to institutional investors. Between May 2018 and early March 2020, initial investors were provided with “sale and issuances rights to receive [SOL] tokens in the future via a Simple Agreement for Future Tokens (SAFTs). Through these offers and sales, Solana sold approximately 177 million SOL, raising over $23 million. Later in March 2020, Solana Labs conducted additional SOL sales on the CoinList trading platform in a “Dutch auction.”
This assessment not only underscores the magnitude of Solana’s fundraising efforts but also aligns with the criteria of an investment contract under the Howey Test—a benchmark for determining whether a transaction qualifies as a security. If SOL is adjudged to meet these criteria, the implications for SOL could be profound.
The classification of SOL as a security could introduce significant regulatory burdens and reshape its market dynamics.
Just last week, Anatoly Yakovenko, co-founder of Solana Labs, expressed his support for Ethereum amid escalating regulatory scrutiny. His statement, shared via X, came after it became known that the SEC is scrutinizing the Ethereum Foundation for a potential classification as a security. “If the state is against ethereum then I am against the state,” he stated.


It is also important to note that the SEC called Solana a security also in the Binance lawsuit, alongside other altcoins like Polygon, Cardano, Filecoin, Cosmos Hub, and gaming-centered projects such as The Sandbox, Decentraland, and Axie Infinity in June 2023. To date, the US agency hasn’t taken any action against Solana Labs.
Market response to the ruling was swift, with Solana’s price witnessing a 5.7% drop, although it managed to recover most of its losses today. At press time, SOL traded at $185.

Dogwifhat (WIF) Catching Up to DOGE and SHIB: Investors' Top Meme Coin Pick for 2024 - Benzinga

If you've looked at crypto in recent months, you've heard something about meme coins. New tokens constantly pop up; millionaires are made in minutes; and unbelievable returns are on the table. As the meme coin mania of early 2024 is beginning to calm down, some are looking for the token that could be the top pick for the remainder of 2024.dogwifhat (WIF), launched in late 2023, is a meme coin based on the Solana chain. The token is based on a picture of a Shiba Inu dog wearing a pink knitted cap. Unlike some meme coins that try to woo investors with ambitious plans for the future and a high-quality website, WIF leans into its identity, with the headline stating that it's "literally just a dog wif a hat." Don't Miss:The token exploded in 2024. It began the year hitting an all-time low of under $0.07. Since then, it has grown exponentially, reaching a high of $3.53 on March 14. At the high, it represented a gain of over 5,000% from lows, which came just two months earlier. The market cap went from around $200 million to well over $3 billion, helping the token cement itself in the top 50 tokens by market cap. WIF also helped revive the Solana chain. If investors wanted to buy the token, they had to buy SOL and swap it for WIF. This practice increased the use of the Solana chain and helped it appreciate over 150% since the launch of SHIB. Many thought that Solana would be unable to recover after the collapse of FTX, but WIF, along with other meme coins and projects, helped SOL recover to near-all-time highs (ATHs).There have been several catalysts for WIF, such as Binance offering the token and LeBron James wearing a pink hat. While the event with James was a coincidence, it brought more attention to the token. The hype hasn't ended yet. WIF investors are eyeing the top spot in terms of meme coins. For this to happen, WIF would have to surpass DOGE and SHIB, which have market caps in the tens of billions.For WIF to catch SHIB, the token would have to go up by an additional 500% from current levels. While this may seem like a lot, it is not out of the question considering WIF's past price movements. It will be interesting to see what is in store for WIF this year. The project could go in several directions, but where WIF ends up will likely be the result of market sentiment, which changes constantly and could work to the benefit or detriment of WIF. Read Next:

DEGEN Launches Arbitrum Orbit-Based L3 Leveraging Base - The Defiant

The price of DEGEN is up more than 2,000% in 30 days.Degen, the recently surging memecoin, has launched its own Layer 3 network.Announced on March 28, Degen teamed up with Syndicate, a Layer 3 infrastructure provider, to launch Degen Chain.The chain was built on top of the Arbitrum Orbit tech stack, will settle transactions on Base — the Ethereum Layer 2 DEGEN launched on — and taps AnyTrust for data availability services. The L3 provides additional utility to the DEGEN token, with the token now functioning as the network gas token for Degen Chain."Arbitrum Orbit was chosen because of its flexibility and ability to support custom gas tokens," Will Papper, co-founder of Syndicate, told The Defiant. "Settling transactions to Base has the benefit of enabling more seamless bridging and on/off-ramping from Base and Coinbase for users and developers."Degen Chain will host the DEGEN token and community moving forward, with the project also inviting third-party developers to build on top of the network.Jacek, the founder of DEGEN, noted that several socialfi-focused applications have already expressed an interest in building on Degen Chain, including Farcaster frames PayBot, Perl, and LottoPGF.DEGEN ralliesDEGEN launched in January, with its developers seeking to ride the momentum of Farcaster, the recently surging decentralized social platform.Farcaster’s daily active user base rocketed by around 2,000% to an all-time high of 40,000 in early February from roughly 2,000 at the start of January, according to Dune Analytics. Farcaster hosted more than 32,000 active users in 24 hours on March 26.DEGEN was airdropped to Farcaster users and positioned itself as a mechanism to reward activity on the platform, such as tipping and liquidity mining. The token has since enjoyed explosive growth, with its price doubling in the past week and rocketing 2,045% in 30 days, according to CoinGecko.DEGEN/USD price history. Source: CoinGecko.The recent momentum has been attributed to growing adoption within the Base ecosystem. DEGEN recently found utility as a vehicle for fundraising, with the project raising $1.5 million last month in grants supporting emerging projects.DEGEN has also benefited from bubbling momentum in the memecoin markets, with the combined capitalization of meme tokens sitting at $70.4 billion after gaining 200% since the start of the year.

Logan Paul Counters CryptoZoo Scam Claims in New Documentary - DailyCoin


        
Logan Paul has told his side of the story on CryptoZoo.



The internet celebrity spoke in a new documentary.



Paul said he would “take care” of the people who made the project look like a scam.
While featuring in a new documentary by journalist Graham Bensinger, YouTuber Logan Paul once again defended his failed CryptoZoo project, saying it “isn’t a scam.”Paul’s rocky escapade with his defunct NFT-based game started last year when blockchain detective Coffeezilla created a multi-part video expose titled Investigating CryptoZoo. In the expose, Coffeezilla chronicles the project’s rise and ultimate fall, presenting evidence that Paul and his team might have conducted their “biggest scam.”While Paul seemingly took accountability, pledging a $2.3 million buyback plan on January 4 to compensate for losses endured by NFT traders, the controversial internet star had another story to tell.Paul’s Side of the Story on CryptoZooTitled 5 Months with Logan Paul, the 54-minute documentary tackles various allegations levied against the internet star. Bensinger stresses how the failed CryptoZoo project “led people to lose money.”Without dismissing the fact that people lost money, Paul argued that the project was not a scam.“Everything you just said has an element of truth to it. Here’s the problem. What you just described isn’t a scam. I took on a project that I was simply incapable of handling at the time,” Paul stated. “I’ve lost half a million dollars on this. Where is the scam?”Paul stated that the CryptoZoo saga “is far from over because it was a one-sided story” and that he would “take care” of the people who made it look like a scam he engineered.
“He [Coffeezilla] told it how he wanted to tell it and told it a certain way that made me look like the captain of the ship.” Paul said.Besides countering the scam allegations, Paul implied that he was a victim of CryptoZoo, too, claiming the project’s predicaments led him to “having suicidal thoughts for the first time” in his life.Stay updated on QuadrigaCX co-founder Michael Patryn’s woes in Canada:

20 Billion Dollar Cryptocurrency Investigation from USA and UK to Russia! - Bitcoin Sistemi


According to Bloomberg, the USA and the UK are investigating the $20 billion cryptocurrency transfer sent to the Russian stock exchange.
The United States and Britain are examining more than $20 billion in cryptocurrency transfers through a Russia-based virtual exchange as part of Russia's efforts to evade sanctions, according to people familiar with the matter.


Knowledgeable people said that the $20 billion transfer examined was made through the Moscow-based cryptocurrency exchange Garantex and using Tether (USDT).
It was stated that the transfers in question took place since Garantex was sanctioned by the USA and the UK on suspicion of facilitating financial crimes and illegal transactions in Russia.





Sources said the $20 billion transaction was one of the largest sanctions violations since the beginning of sanctions against Russia.
At this point, Tether, which supported the investigation, said that it had frozen all assets of the organizations whose addresses were on the US sanctions list related to the US-UK investigation.


Tether said in a statement to Bloomberg:

“With Tether, every action can be online, every transaction can be tracked, every asset can be seized, and every criminal can be caught.
“We are working with law enforcement to do exactly that in relation to the US-UK investigation.”

Crypto's true power lies in its small yet impactful nature | Cryptopolitan

Katherine Dowling from Bitwise Asset Management compared investing in cryptocurrency to adding cayenne pepper to a dish during a conference in West Palm Beach, Florida. She meant that just a small amount of crypto can make a big difference in an investment portfolio. Ivory Johnson, a financial advisor and CNBC Council member, agrees with Dowling. He believes that because cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin are so up and down, investors should only need a little bit in their portfolios to see an impact. Johnson, who runs Delancey Wealth Management, suggests that having 2% to 3% of your investment in crypto is plenty.Understanding Crypto’s Role in Your PortfolioJohnson points out that cryptocurrencies are an “alternative investment,” different from traditional stocks, bonds, and cash. He explained that even a tiny bit of crypto could grow fast and balance out other slower-growing investments in your portfolio.Investing in crypto depends a lot on how much risk someone can handle. Johnson mentioned that younger investors might go for a bigger slice of crypto, up to 5% to 7%, because they have time to bounce back from any losses. However, he cautioned against older investors putting too much into crypto due to the high risk of losing their retirement savings.The unpredictability of crypto is well-known. Bitcoin, for example, reached an all-time high of over $73,000 before dropping below $69,000. Despite a rough 2022, Bitcoin’s value has significantly rebounded, showing its volatile nature.The Highs and Lows of Investing in CryptoThe ease of investing in crypto improved with the introduction of bitcoin exchange-traded funds approved by the Securities and Exchange Commission. Johnson suggests buying a small amount over time and adjusting investments to keep the portfolio balanced.A story of resilience came from Heather Ferguson, whose son lost $130,000 when the FTX crypto exchange collapsed. Later, he learned he would get his money back, which showed the unpredictable nature of investing in crypto.The legal saga around Sam Bankman-Fried, the former executive of FTX found guilty of fraud, adds another layer of drama to the crypto world. His sentencing is under debate, with some arguing for leniency due to efforts to repay affected customers.Bankman-Fried’s trial revealed deep issues within the crypto industry and sparked discussions about the impact of neurological conditions on behavior and decision-making. Letters from concerned parents, including those with children on the autism spectrum, highlighted these complexities.Maria Centrella and Matt Kelly, both parents of children with autism, shared their perspectives, hoping to influence the sentencing by pointing out that those on the spectrum may process situations differently.

Institutional Demand and Technicals Remain Bullish for Bitcoin Despite Strong Price Resistance | Coinspeaker



Major institutional investors, such as BlackRock and ARK 21Shares, have invested $323 million and $200 million, respectively, signaling their confidence in BTC Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs)

The cryptocurrency market has been a battleground of bulls and bears. Bitcoin (BTC) has faced a series of short-term volatility events, forming various highs and lows as it struggles to reclaim its previous all-time high.
Bitcoin’s price broke above $70,000 again two days ago, prompting many analysts to jump into predictions. The prevailing one being that the coin was going to break into an all-time high (ATH) in no time. Since then, BTC has been consolidating, trading sideways within the range of $69,000 to $71,000 and closing at $70,000 and around $69,400 on Tuesday and Wednesday, respectively.




Ali Charts, a prominent onchain analyst, shed light on the coin’s price struggle to regain its new all-time high and explained that there are crucial resistance levels at $70,180 and $70,600. These price points are levels where there are a lot of selling orders from BTC bears. According to his on-chain analytics, 292,000 and 397,000 addresses are creating strong resistance at those prices, respectively. He continued by saying that if the bulls can successfully break above those resistances, there is a significant barrier again on their way to another ATH.


Technical Analysis Unveils Bullish Potential
Ali, in a different post, further revealed that the coin appears to be breaking out of a bull flag pattern on the 4-hour chart. If BTC can maintain its position above the $70,000 level, the analyst anticipates a surge of nearly 10%, propelling BTC to an all-time high of $77,000.
Echoing this optimism is another notable crypto analyst, Benjamin Cowen, founder of ITC Crypto, who opined that the BTC dominance train is about to leave its station, further fueling the confidence of the bulls and creating a favorable market environment for Bitcoin and potentially for other cryptocurrencies as well.
Institutional Influx Fuels Bullish Sentiment
Fueling the bullish sentiment is the substantial inflow of capital into the crypto market over the past 24 hours. Major institutional investors, such as BlackRock and ARK 21Shares, have invested $323 million and $200 million, respectively, signaling their confidence in BTC Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs). This active buying aligns with Bitcoin’s positive price movement and could potentially shift market dynamics.
Corroborating the increasing demand, Ali revealed that whales (large investors) have accumulated more than 100,000 BTC, worth approximately $7 billion, over the past seven days. The substantial accumulation by institutional and high-net-worth individuals further showcases the growing interest in BTC as a viable investment asset.


Judging from analysts predictions about a bullish rally and significant whale accumulation, this indicates a potential upward trend. The resistances that are stopping the price from going upward seem to be very temporary. In no time, we should see the price hit an all-time high, which could also affect market sentiment towards altcoins and drive them bullish.

This Analyst Foresees Crash for Dogecoin (DOGE) and Shiba Inu (SHIB) Prices as Emerging Rival Gains Favor with Whales | Cryptopolitan

The cryptocurrency market is in a state of flux as emerging projects challenge the dominance of established tokens like Dogecoin (DOGE) and Shiba Inu (SHIB). With the rise of Retik Finance (RETIK), an innovative newcomer, some analysts are predicting a significant shift in market dynamics. Let us delve into the analysis of an expert who foresees a crash in DOGE and SHIB prices as Retik Finance gains favor among influential investors known as “whales.”The Emergence of Retik Finance (RETIK)Retik Finance has quickly gained traction in the cryptocurrency space, offering a range of innovative features and solutions that address the limitations of traditional finance. From futuristic DeFi debit cards to AI-powered peer-to-peer lending, Retik Finance has positioned itself as a formidable competitor to established meme coins like DOGE and SHIB. Retik Finance has achieved a significant milestone by securing over $32 million in total funds, showcasing its robust development momentum and active engagement with investors. This accomplishment underscores the platform’s unwavering commitment to growth and innovation within the cryptocurrency industry. Furthermore, Retik Finance’s successful completion of a thorough audit by Certik, a highly esteemed blockchain security firm, bolsters its credibility and resilience, instilling confidence among investors. The platform’s strategic initiatives, including the recent $333,000 giveaway event, have played a pivotal role in fostering vibrant community participation and bolstering investor confidence in Retik Finance. This event not only served as a means to reward the community for their unwavering support but also demonstrated the platform’s dedication to engaging with its user base. In acknowledgment of Retik Finance’s achievements during the presale phase, the platform is thrilled to announce a special $5000 giveaway. Participating is straightforward: users are encouraged to share an original photo, video, or meme that encapsulates their excitement for Retik Finance. Twenty-five fortunate winners will each receive $200 as a token of appreciation for their steadfast support and dedication to the Retik Finance community.The Downfall of Dogecoin (DOGE)Once hailed as the “people’s cryptocurrency,” Dogecoin’s meteoric rise has been overshadowed by its lack of utility and technological stagnation. Analysts argue that DOGE’s reliance on social media hype and celebrity endorsements makes it vulnerable to market manipulation and sudden price crashes.The Decline of Shiba Inu (SHIB) Shiba Inu, another meme-inspired token, faces similar challenges as DOGE. Despite its vibrant community and ambitious ecosystem plans, SHIB’s lack of real-world use cases and reliance on speculative trading have raised concerns among investors.The Rise of Retik Finance (RETIK) and Whale Favoritism Retik Finance’s innovative features and proactive community engagement have attracted the attention of influential investors known as “whales.” These deep-pocketed individuals have begun accumulating RETIK tokens, signaling a shift in favor away from DOGE and SHIB. According to the analyst, the increasing favoritism towards Retik Finance among whales could lead to a significant sell-off in DOGE and SHIB prices. With Retik Finance offering a more robust and innovative platform, investors may opt to reallocate their funds, causing a downward spiral in DOGE and SHIB’s market value. As Retik Finance continues to gain momentum and favor among influential investors, the future looks uncertain for Dogecoin and Shiba Inu. While both tokens have enjoyed periods of success, their reliance on hype and speculation may not be enough to sustain long-term growth. About Retik FinanceRetik Finance (RETIK) is a cutting-edge decentralized finance (DeFi) project revolutionizing global transactions with its innovative suite of financial solutions.

FTX's SBF Sentenced to 25 Years in Prison

Prior to receiving his sentence from the judge, Bankman-Fried spoke for several minutes in which, repeatedly, he made the claim that "there were enough assets, there are enough assets" for FTX's creditors to get paid back in full. The focus of Bankman-Fried and two victims who also spoke focused primarily on the FTX bankruptcy estate and its proposed payouts to creditors, which they all said are lower than they should be given current market prices. Bankman-Fried named three of the government's key witnesses, Nishad Singh, Gary Wang and Caroline Ellison, and expressed regret for his role in FTX's collapse.

Creating ‘good’ AGI that won’t kill us all: Crypto’s Artificial Superintelligence Alliance


            
After a year of increasingly dire warnings about the imminent demise of humanity at the hands of superintelligent artificial intelligence (AI), Magazine is in Panama at the Beneficial AGI Conference to hear the other side of the story.Attendees include an eclectic mix of transhumanists, crypto folk, sci-fi authors including David Brin, futurists and academics.  



We’re at the conference run by SingularityNET, a key member of the proposed new Artificial Superintelligence Alliance, to find out what happens if everything goes right with creating artificial general intelligence (AGI) — human-level, artificial general intelligence.



But how do we bring about that future, rather than the scenario in which Skynet goes rogue and kills us all?



One of the best insights into why those questions are so important comes from futurist Jose Luis Cordeiro, author of The Death of Death, who believes humanity will cure all diseases and aging thanks to AGI.He tells Magazine of some sage wisdom that Arthur C. Clarke, the author of 2001: A Space Odyssey, once told him.  




“He said: ‘We have to be positive about the future because the images of the future — of what’s possible — begin with our minds. If we think we will self-destroy, most likely we will. But if we think that we will survive, [that] we will move into a better world [then we] will work toward that and we will achieve it.’ So it begins in our minds.”




Janet Adams, CEO of SingularityNET, warms the conference up with some yoga. (Fenton)



Beneficial AGI: The quest for artificial general intelligence 



Humans are hardwired to focus more on the existential threats from AGI than on the benefits.Evolutionary speaking, it’s better that our species worries nine times too often that the wind rustling in the bushes could be a tiger than it is to be blithely unconcerned about the rustling and get eaten by a tiger on the 10th occurrence.






Even the doomers don’t put a high percentage chance of AGI killing us all, with a survey of almost 3000 AI researchers suggesting the chance of an extremely bad outcome ranges from around 5% to 10%. So while that’s worryingly high, the odds are still in our favor.Also read: Ben Goertzel profile — How to prevent AI from ‘annihilating humanity’ using blockchain



Opening the conference, SingularityNET founder and the “Father of AGI,” Dr. Ben Goertzel, paid tribute to Ethereum founder Vitalik Buterin’s concept of defensive accelerationism. That’s the midpoint between the effective accelerationism techno-optimists and their “move fast and break things” ethos, and the decelerationists, who want to slow down or halt the galloping pace of AI development.Goertzel believes that deceleration is impossible but concedes there’s a small chance things could go horribly wrong with AGI. So he’s in favor of pursuing AGI while being mindful of the potential dangers. Like many in the AI/crypto field, he believes the solution is open-sourcing the technology and decentralizing the hardware and governance.

This week SingularityNET announced it has teamed up with the decentralized multi-agent platform FetchAI — founded by DeepMind veteran Humayun Sheikh — and the data exchange platform Ocean Protocol to form the Artificial Superintelligence Alliance (ASI).It will be the largest open-sourced independent player in AI research and development and has proposed merging SingularityNET, FetchAI and Ocean Protocol’s existing tokens into a new one called ASI. It would have a fully diluted market cap of around $7.5 billion — subject to approval votes over the next two weeks. The three platforms would continue to operate as separate entities under the guidance of Goertzel, with Sheikh as chair.According to the Alliance, the aim is to “create a powerful compelling alternative to Big Tech’s control over AI development, use and monetization” by creating decentralized AI infrastructure at scale and accelerating investment into blockchain-based AGI.







What are the benefits of AGI?



Probably the most obvious beneficial impact is AGI’s potential to analyze huge swathes of data to help solve many of our most difficult scientific, environmental, social and medical issues.



We’ve already seen some amazing medical breakthroughs, with MIT researchers using AI models to evaluate tens of thousands of potential chemical compounds and discovered the first new class of antibiotics in 60 years, one that’s effective against the hitherto drug-resistant MRSA bacteria. It’s the sort of scaling up of research that’s almost impossible for humans to achieve.And that’s all before we get to the immortality and mind-uploading stuff that the transhumanists get very excited about but which weirds most people out.  



This ability to analyze great swathes of data also suggests the technology will be able to give early warnings of pandemics, natural disasters and environmental issues. AI and AGI also have the potential to free humans from drudgery and repetitive work, from coding to customer service help desks.






While this will cause a massive upheaval to the workforce, the invention of washing machines and Amazon’s online businesses had big impacts on particular occupations. The hope is that a bunch of new jobs will be created instead.



Economic professor Robin Hanson says this has happened over the past two decades, even though people were very concerned at the turn of the century that automation would replace workers.  



Hanson’s study of the data on how automation impacted wages and employment across various industries between 1999 and 2019 found that despite big changes, most people still had jobs and were paid pretty much the same.



“On average, there wasn’t a net effect on wages or jobs in automation of U.S. jobs from 1999 to 2018,” he says.

AGI could make better decisions than we can: SingularityNET CEO Janet Adams 



Janet Adams, the optimistic CEO of SingularityNET, explains that AGI has the potential to be “extraordinarily positive for all humanity.”



“I see a future in which our future AGIs are making decisions which are more ethical than the decisions which humans make. And they can do that because they don’t have emotions or jealousy or greed or hidden agendas,” she says.Adams points out that 25,000 people die every day from hunger, even as people in rich countries throw away mountains of food. It’s a problem that could be solved by “intelligent allocation of resources across the planet,” she says. But Adams warns AGI needs to be trained on data sets reflecting the entire world’s population and not just the top 1% so that when they make decisions, “they won’t make them just for the benefit of the powerful few, they will make them for the benefit of the broader civilization, broader humanity.”



AI safety and ethics: Addressing the concerns



Anyone who watched the early utopian dreams of a decentralized internet crumble into a corporate ad-filled landscape of addictive design and engagement farming may have doubts this rosy future is possible.Building high-end AI requires a mountain of computing and other resources that are currently out of reach of all but a handful of the usual suspects: Nvidia, Google, Meta and Microsoft. So the default assumption is that one of these tech giants will end up controlling AGI.Goertzel, a long-haired hippy who plays in a surprisingly good band fronted by a robot, wants to challenge that assumption. 



Goertzel points out that the default assumption used to be that companies like IBM would win the computing industry and Yahoo would win search.

“The reason these things change is because people were concretely fighting to change it in each instance,” he says. “Instead, Bill Gates, Steve Jobs and the Google guys came along.”



The founder of SingularityNET, he’s been thinking about the Singularity (a theoretical moment when technological development increases exponentially) since the early 1970s when he read an early book on the subject called The Prometheus Project. 



He’s been working on AGI for much of the time since then, popularizing the term AGI and launching the OpenCog AI framework in 2008.



Adams says Goertzel is a key reason SingularityNET has a credible shot.“We are the biggest not-for-profit, crypto-funded AI science and research team on the planet,” Adams says, noting their competitors have been focused on “narrow AIs” like ChatGPT and are only now shifting their strategy to AGI.



“They’re years behind us,” she says. “We have three decades of research with Dr. Ben Goertzel in neural symbolic methods.”



But she adds that opening up the platform to any and all developers around the world and rewarding them for their contribution will give it the edge even over the mega-corporations who currently dominate the space.



“Because we have a powerful vision and a powerful commitment to building the most advanced, most intelligent AGI in a democratic way, it’s hard to imagine that Big Tech or any other player could come in and compete, particularly when you’re up against open source.”



“[We will] see a potentially huge influx of people developing on the SingularityNET marketplace and the continued escalation of pace toward AGI. There’s a good chance it will be us.”



HyperCycle CEO Toufi Saliba (Fenton)



Decentralized AI: Opening the door to open source development 



The Prometheus Project proposed that AI was such an earth-shattering development that everyone in the world should get a democratic vote on its development.



So when blockchain emerged, it seemed like implementing decentralized infrastructure and token-based governance for AI was the next most practical alternative.



HyperCycle CEO Toufi Saliba tells Magazine this mitigates the threat of a centralized company or authoritarian country gaining immense power from developing AGI first, which would be “the worst thing that ever happened to humanity.”



Also read: Real AI use cases in crypto, No 1: The best use of money for AI is crypto It’s not the only potential solution to the problem. Meta chief AI scientist Yan Le Cun is a big proponent of open-sourcing AI models and letting a thousand flowers bloom, while X owner Elon Musk recently open-sourced the model for Grok.



But blockchain is arguably a big step up. SingularityNET aims to network the technology around the world, with different components controlled by different communities, thereby spreading the risk of any single company, group or government controlling the AGI.






“So you could use these infrastructures to implement decentralized deep neural networks, you could use them to implement a huge logic engine, you can use them to implement an artificial life approach where you have a simulated ecosystem and a bunch of little artificial animals interacting and trying to evolve toward intelligence,” explains Goertzel.




“I want to foster creative contributions from everywhere, and it may be some, you know, 12-year-old genius from Tajikistan comes up with a new artificial life innovation that provides a breakthrough to AGI.”




It’s possible the fate of the world may rest in this man’s hands. (Fenton)



What is HyperCycle? What is OpenCog Hyperon?



HyperCycle is a ledgerless blockchain that’s fast enough to allow AI components to communicate, coordinate and transact to finality in under 300 milliseconds. The idea is to give AIs a way to call on the resources of other AIs, paid for via microtransactions.For now, the fledgling network is being used for small-scale applications, like an AI app calling on another AI service to help complete a task. But in time, as the network scales, it’s theoretically possible that AGI might be an emergent property of the various AI components working together in a sort of distributed brain. 



“So, in that approach, the entire world has a much higher chance to get to AGI as a single entity,” Saliba says.



Goertzel didn’t develop HyperCycle for that reason — he just needed something miles faster than existing blockchains to enable AIs to work together.  



The project he’s most excited about is OpenCog Hyperon, which launches in alpha this month. It “combines together deep neural nets, logic engines, evolutionary learning and other AI paradigms in the same software framework, for updating the same extremely decentralized Knowledge Graph.”The idea is to throw open the doors to anyone who wants to work on it in the hope they can improve the METTA AGI programming language so it can scale up massively. “We will have the complete toolset for building the baby AGI,” he says. “To get something I would want to call it baby AGI we will need that million times speed up of the METTA interpreter,” he says.



“My own best guess is that Opencog Hyperon may be the system to make the [AGI] breakthrough.”



AI governance: The role of voting systems 



Of course, decentralization does not ensure things will go right with AGI. As Goertzel points out, the government of Somalia was decentralized very widely in the 1990s under a bunch of warlords and militias, but it would have been preferable at the time to live under the centralized government of Finland.Furthermore, token-based governance is a long way from being fit for prime time. In projects like Uniswap and Maker, large holders like a16z and the core team have so many tokens it’s almost not worth anyone else voting. Many other decentralized autonomous organizations are wracked by politics and infighting.The surging price of crypto/AI projects has attracted a bunch of token speculators. Are these really the people we want to put in control of AGI?



Goertzel argues that while blockchain projects are currently primarily attractive to people interested in making money, that will change as the use case evolves. 



“If we roll out the world’s smartest AI on decentralized networks, you will get a lot of other people involved who are not primarily oriented toward financial speculation. And then it’ll be a different culture.”



But if the Artificial Superintelligence Alliance does achieve AGI, wouldn’t its tokens be ludicrously expensive and out of reach of those primarily interested in beneficial AGI?Goetzel suggests that perhaps a weighted voting system that prioritizes those who have contributed to the project may be required:



“I think for guiding the mind of the AGI, we want to roll out a fairly sophisticated, decentralized reputation system and have something closer to one person, one vote, but where people who have some track record of contributing to the AI network and making some sense, get a higher weighting.”



As Goertzel has told Magazine previously, our chances of controlling AGI after a certain point are slim. (Fenton)

Call of Duty cheaters targeted with crypto-draining software


Gamers downloading cheats for the first-person shooter Call of Duty are reportedly being targeted by crypto-draining malware that has so far compromised the details of more than 4.9 million accounts.
Call of Duty cheat provider Phantom Overlay was made aware of the malware campaign this week after users started to make unauthorized purchases. Phantom Overlay provides a marketplace for Call of Duty gamers to buy cheats, such as aimbot and player detection behind walls.
As reported by malware sleuth VX Underground, an unknown entity is using malware to steal the credentials of cheaters before publishing them online. The culprit has also infected users with crypto-draining malware capable of stealing bitcoin from Electrum wallets.

Malware campaign spawns unlikely alliance 
VX claims that “in a bizarre twist of fate,” video game company Activision Blizzard is working alongside cheat providers to help users infected with the malware because “The scope of the impact is so large.”
Indeed, VX reports that the accounts of an estimated 3,662,627 Battlenet, 561,183 Activision, 117,366 Elitepvpers, 572,831 UnknownCheats, and 1,365 Phantom Overlay have been compromised, making up 4,915,372 accounts altogether.

Phantom Overlay reportedly approached gaming forum Elitepvpers, which confirmed that over 40,000 of its accounts were comprised
VX Underground claims that the amount of crypto stolen and the malware delivery methods are currently unknown. VX also clarified that not all of the comprised accounts are cheaters, adding that some impacted users were utilizing software for latency improvement, controller boosting, and VPNs.
Protos has contacted Phantom Overlay, Elitepvpers, and Activision Blizzard for comment and will update if we hear back.

Is MicroStrategy's Bitcoin Strategy a Double-Edged Sword? This Hedge Fund Thinks So - Tokenist


					
Neither the author, Tim Fries, nor this website, The Tokenist, provide financial advice. Please consult our website policy prior to making financial decisions.



Kerrisdale Capital has recommended a unique investment strategy involving Bitcoin and MicroStrategy (NASDAQ: MSTR) shares. The investment firm suggests going long on Bitcoin while shorting MicroStrategy shares, anticipating that the premium at which MicroStrategy often trades due to its Bitcoin holdings might contract, as it has in the past.



Hedge Fund Claims MicroStrategy’s Premium Cannot Be Sustained and ‘Leverage Cuts Both Ways’



MicroStrategy is often considered a proxy for Bitcoin due to its strategic decision to hold the cryptocurrency as a store of value and use debt to purchase more Bitcoin.



Kerrisdale argues that the premium at which MicroStrategy’s stock trades is excessively high, especially given the increasing accessibility of Bitcoin to investors through brokerages, exchanges, and new spot exchange-traded funds.



These developments have diminished MicroStrategy’s unique position as a way for investors to gain exposure to Bitcoin. While MicroStrategy’s stock has surged over 200% alongside Bitcoin’s record rally, Kerrisdale notes that the premium to Bitcoin can both benefit and harm shareholders.



The report also highlights the downside of MicroStrategy’s leverage strategy. Despite the company increasing its Bitcoin holdings, the massive dilution has kept the amount of Bitcoin per share virtually unchanged. Shareholder value has mainly been driven by Bitcoin’s price appreciation rather than any unique value added by MicroStrategy.



Betting against MicroStrategy has been unprofitable for short sellers, who have faced significant paper losses this year. However, Kerrisdale’s pair trade strategy suggests that there may be an opportunity to profit from the potential contraction of MicroStrategy’s premium while still benefiting from the appreciation of Bitcoin itself.





MicroStrategy’s Bitcoin Buys Summarized



MicroStrategy has amassed a significant portfolio of Bitcoin, totaling 214,245 Bitcoins at a current price of $71,413.03 per Bitcoin. The portfolio’s total value is an impressive $15.34 billion, representing an all-time profit of approximately $7.76 billion, or a 102.4% increase from the initial investment. The company’s average purchase price, or dollar-cost average, is $35,372.59 per Bitcoin.



MicroStrategy’s purchases have been made at various price points, ranging from as low as $10,419.15 to as high as $68,477.00 per Bitcoin, with a total reported cost of $7.578 billion.



The portfolio has experienced varying degrees of profit across different transactions, with percentages ranging from 20.4% to over 500% for specific buys.



MicroStrategy Stock Brief



MicroStrategy shares were trading at $1,889.00, down $30.16 (-1.57%), as of 10:40 AM EDT on Thursday. The company has a market capitalization of $32.053 billion.



The stock opened at $1,942.00 and has fluctuated between $1,822.23 and $1,989.00 throughout the day, compared to the previous close of $1,919.16. Over the past 52 weeks, the stock has traded between $266.00 and $1,999.99.



The trading volume for the day stood at 1,121,956 shares, lower than the average volume of 2,254,900 shares. The stock has a beta of 2.83 (5-year monthly) and a PE ratio (TTM) of 71.34, with earnings per share (TTM) of $26.48.



The company is expected to report its next earnings between April 29, 2024, and May 3, 2024. MicroStrategy does not currently offer a forward dividend. Analysts have set a one-year target estimate for the stock at $1,144.25.







Do you think MicroStrategy’s premium will make sense in the future as Bitcoin continues to gain mainstream adoption? Let us know in the comments below.

Ethereum: Security or not, BlackRock CEO confident in ETH ETF approval - AMBCrypto



BlackRock CEO said Ethereum ETF approval is likely despite ETH designation.
Hopeful issuers are adding “staking” to ‘nudge the SEC.”

Blackrock’s Larry Fink’s recent take on Ethereum [ETH] ETF approval has many commentators speculating on possible outcomes.
In a recent interview with FOX Business, Larry Fink was asked if one can start an ETH ETF even if ETH is designated as “security.” To which he answered, 
“Yes, I think so.”
He added that ETH designation or categorization won’t harm ETF approval.
Fink’s revelation has sparked new speculation. 
ETH ETF approval in May
Nate Geraci of ETF Store reacted to Fink’s revelation on X (formerly Twitter) and shared his opinion; 
“Just reading b/w lines & speculating, sounds like SEC seriously trying to classify eth as security.  If so, tough to have optimism on May spot eth ETF approval. 
That said, Fink says SEC could still allow spot eth ETF post-security classification.”
Another source of confusion regarding the ETH ETF approval is the addition of “staking” in recent amendments by potential issuers. 
On 27th March, Fidelity amended its ETH ETF filing to include “staking” to users. The filing stated; 
“As a result of any staking activity in which the trust may engage, the trust expects to receive certain staking rewards of ether, which may be treated for federal income tax purposes as income to the trust.”
Like Fidelity, Grayscale’s ETH ETF filing included staking. 
However, these trends are confusing given the SEC’s stance on staking, as seen during the Kraken lawsuit in 2023. 
During the Kraken fine, the SEC warned that,
“When investors provide tokens to staking-as-a-service providers, they lose control of those tokens and take on risks associated with those platforms, with very little protection.”
Bloomberg ETF analyst Eric Balchunas claimed that the reason hopeful issuers are adding staking on the filing is to,
“To nudge the SEC, hope squeaky wheel gets grease. And, I respect the hustle but I just think SEC’s mind is decided on this.”
The Bloomberg ETF analyst has maintained a pessimistic 25% odd of May approval for ETH ETFs. 
However, Fink’s positive inclination toward approval, even if ETH is classified as a “security,” is worth noting. If Fink’s stance pans out, we might eventually have an ETH ETF either way.

The Bulls Are Back: Spot Bitcoin Inflows Surge With New Records


                            Bitcoin bulls look to be firmly back in the driver’s seat following weeks of seeing BTC suffer a bearish sentiment with its price dips. The current bullish outlook for the flagship crypto is evident in the fact that the Spot Bitcoin ETFs are again recording an impressive amount of inflows. 
Spot Bitcoin ETFs Record $243 Million In Inflows
Farside Investors revealed in an X (formerly Twitter) post that the Spot Bitcoin ETFs recorded $243 million in inflows on March 27. This record was primarily thanks to BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) and the ARK 21Shares’ Bitcoin ETF (ARKB), which saw individual inflows of $323.8 million and $200.7 million, respectively. 

These inflows were enough to overshadow the $299.8 million that Grayscale’s Bitcoin ETF GBTC recorded on the day. Meanwhile, this marks the third consecutive day that these Spot Bitcoin ETFs have recorded net inflows, having seen net outflows throughout last week. These funds recorded an inflow of $418 million and $15.4 million on March 26 and 25, respectively. 
This is undoubtedly a welcome development for the crypto community, considering that analysts at JPMorgan already predicted that the wave of profit-taking from the BTC ETFs could last until Halving. Therefore, seeing sustained inflows into these ETFs could mean that the sentiment among these ETF investors has changed. 
Irrespective of the current outlook for these ETFs, there is reason to be confident about their future trajectory and how much funds could still flow into the Bitcoin ecosystem. Matt Hougan, the Chief Investment Officer (CIO) at Bitwise, recently suggested that the demand for these Bitcoin ETFs is far from its peak. That means that these funds could still witness an astonishing amount of inflows.
BTC Still Primed For More Upside Move Before Halving
The current bullish sentiment towards BTC suggests that the flagship crypto move could see further moves to the upside before the Halving event in mid-April. Besides the Spot Bitcoin ETFs, which are back to recording net inflows, other fundamentals hint at a price surge for BTC soon enough. 

NewsBTC recently reported that the supply of BTC on centralized exchanges (CEX) has been declining lately, which means that the sell pressure for the crypto token has reduced significantly. With Bitcoin whales cooling off on selling, that leaves room for BTC to embark on an upward trend. 
At the time of writing, BTC is trading at around $70,300, up in the last 24 hours according to data from CoinMarketCap.

Crypto Crackdown: US, UK Zero In On Hamas Funds In Gaza


								In a synchronized move aimed at disrupting the financial infrastructure backing Hamas, the United States and the United Kingdom have taken decisive action by imposing sanctions on Gaza Now, an internet-based media platform allegedly involved in financing the militant group.
The focal point of these sanctions is directed towards Mustafa Ayash, the mastermind behind Gaza Now, alongside various individuals and entities connected to the organization’s fundraising endeavors.
The decision to implement these measures stemmed from an extensive inquiry into Gaza Now’s fundraising initiatives subsequent to the occurrence of an assault in Israel on October 7th.
Cryptocurrency In Terrorism Financing



To address the challenges posed by the limited use of cryptocurrencies in terrorist financing, there is a growing recognition for a reevaluation of strategies and tools in combatting terrorism financing.
Authorities and regulatory bodies must enhance monitoring capabilities and establish more effective regulatory mechanisms within the digital currency space.

The preference for specific cryptocurrencies, such as Tether on the TRON blockchain, is driven by attributes like low transaction fees and perceived anonymity, highlighting the complexities faced in countering terrorism financing in the digital age.
The sanctions imposed by the US and UK form part of a wider international approach to counter the financing of terrorism. Both countries’ Treasury Departments emphasize the importance of global collaboration in addressing these issues.
In addition to the sanctions, the UK has implemented a comprehensive asset freeze on individuals and entities associated with Gaza Now to reinforce the principle that the financial system should not be exploited for terrorist activities.

The sanctions imposed on Gaza Now and its affiliates demonstrate a firm stance against entities involved in financing terrorism. The US and UK aim to disrupt the financial networks supporting Hamas through these measures, thereby weakening their operations and capabilities. The sanctions serve as a clear message that any attempt to exploit the financial system for illicit activities will face severe consequences.

In countering terrorism financing in the digital age, specific challenges arise, including the anonymity of cryptocurrencies, the lack of regulatory frameworks, the proliferation of cryptocurrency exchanges, the use of privacy-focused cryptocurrencies, sophisticated money laundering techniques, and the need for collaboration and information sharing.
Gaza Groups Raise Over $130 Million In Crypto Since 2021
Since at least 2019, Hamas and Palestinian Islamic Jihad (PIJ) have made an effort to raise money through cryptocurrencies in an effort to obtain funds outside of the most popular means of financial transfers. Restrictions on access to the international banking system result from the groups’ designation as terrorist organizations in Israel, the US, and other Western countries.
According to estimates, since 2021, terrorist organizations in Gaza have raised over $130 million in cryptocurrencies, with $41 million coming from Hamas and $93 million from Palestinian Islamic Jihad.
Defence Minister Yoav Gallant has disclosed that Iran provides the lion’s share of international money to the terror groups operating in Gaza. The country has financed the PIJ with tens of millions of dollars annually and Hamas with about $100 million each year.

Nansen integrates blockchain data from SportFi chain Chiliz and Ethereum rollup zkSync

Cryptocurrency users looking for the latest “alpha” in SportFi and zero-knowledge rollups can keep close tabs on data and insights from blockchain Chiliz and Ethereum layer 2 zkSync through new integrations on Nansen.The blockchain analytics platform announced the integration of the two different protocols on March 28, unlocking on-chain data analytics and insights for its users. Nansen data journalist Martin Lee told Cointelegraph that the integration provides a high-level overview of both ecosystems, allowing cryptocurrency teams to run their own queries and get insights from the raw data itself via Nansen query:“Users can gain insights into the daily active users and transactions on the chain, as well as which entities and protocols are seeing the most usage via the macro dashboard.”The functionality will unlock data insights into Chiliz, the proprietary blockchain powering scores of fan tokens licensed by high-profile sports teams and organizations worldwide that operate on the Socios platform.Related: Man and machine: Nansen’s analytics slowly labeling worldwide walletsChiliz and Socios CEO Alexandre Dreyfus says the collaboration will deepen the understanding of the Chiliz ecosystem and potentially drive user adoption and growth of the SportFi ecosystem:“Having Chiliz Chain on Nansen is a critical step to grow the ecosystem and help developers and industry stakeholders to start looking at Chiliz at a legitimate layer-1 with a very long-term vision.”According to data from CoinMarketCap, the Chiliz blockchain has a total market capitalization of $1.2 billion.

The Bitcoin halving is just weeks away - here’s how miners have prepared - Blockworks


Mining companies are bracing themselves for the Bitcoin halving — a time expected to weed out the segment’s less efficient operators, and those with trouble accessing capital.
Per-block mining rewards are set to drop from 6.25 bitcoin (BTC) to 3.125 BTC on or around April 20. Such an event occurs roughly every four years.  
Read more: The next Bitcoin halving is coming. Here’s what you need to know
While some industry players are expected to struggle, other firms have made it clear they intend to take advantage of buying opportunities and set themselves up for future growth.
Such vision takes preparation, and miner moves have been aplenty in recent months.
While some miners have already started acquiring properties, others have focused on buying new and more efficient machines. Cutting costs and diversifying revenue sources has been another strategy used by various companies.
Let’s take a deeper look.
Acquiring sites
While a bunch of the larger mining companies have signaled the intent to be opportunistic in a post-halving world, some have already started to buy properties.
Compass Point research and trading analyst Joe Flynn has referred to Marathon Digital as “the 800-pound gorilla” in the mining space. Indeed, the company sported an energized hash rate of 28.7 exahashes per second (EH/s) as of Feb. 29, and has no plans to slow down. 
The company closed its acquisition of two mining facilities in Texas and Nebraska in January. Marathon more recently revealed its intent to buy a Texas bitcoin mining facility owned by Applied Digital for roughly $87 million.
CleanSpark has also bought facilities this year — completing its acquisition of three data centers in Mississippi last month.
The purchases — as part of a $19.8 million cash deal — were set to expand CleanSpark’s operating hash rate by 2.4 EH/s.
Bitfarms bought land in Yguazu, Paraguay in January for a planned 100 megawatt (MW) facility. Near the Itaipú Dam, the facility — to boost Bitfarms’ portfolio of “low-cost renewable hydropower” — is set to be completed in the second half of 2024, the company said at the time. 
Refreshing machine fleets
Buying mining machines was a trend in 2023, as a dozen or so public mining companies committed more than $1 billion in purchase orders, according to BlocksBridge Consulting data.
Read more: Crypto miners keep busy ahead of halving with accelerated machine buys
Among the larger purchases was Riot Platforms’ buy of 66,560 MicroBT machines for $290.5 million in December — amounting to 18 EH/s of mining capacity.
Riot then bought 31,500 more miners from MicroBT last month, for $97.4 million. About 17,000 of those machines were set to replace “under-performing” miners in its Rockdale, TX facility, Riot CEO Jason Les said at the time.
Others have followed suit with acquiring and deploying new machines that improve the company’s mining efficiency.
Bitfarms revealed in November it had ordered 35,888 Bitmain T21 miners as part of a so-called “transformative fleet upgrade” — with deliveries slated between March and May.
The company then agreed to buy nearly 52,000 more machines earlier this month.
“Securing these miners now is a key part of our strategy to drive rapid and meaningful improvements across our three key operating metrics of hashrate, energy efficiency and operating costs per terahash with a plan to capture greater upside from rising bitcoin prices with rapidly expanding mining margins,” Bitfarms CEO Geoff Morphy said in a statement.
The latest Bitfarms purchase came just days after the company said it planned to sell common shares of the company to gain proceeds of up to $375 million.
Bitmain agreed to invest $53 million in Core Scientific in September ahead of Core’s emergence out of bankruptcy in January. That Bitmain deal was set to supply the mining company with 27,000 Bitmain S19J bitcoin mining servers — totaling 4.1 EH/s of hash rate. 
Core Scientific said earlier this month that it completed the payments due in 2024 for its S19J and S21 machines.
CleanSpark bought 4.4 EH/s worth of Antminer machines in October, while New York-based Cipher Mining purchased 16,700 Avalon A1466 miners from Canaan in January. 
Most recently, Singapore-headquartered Bitdeer said Tuesday it was set to install new SEALMINER A1 miners as part of an initial 3.4 EH/s expansion in Texas and Norway. The company said it would be retiring older mining rigs as part of the upgrade.
Cost-cutting and diversifying revenues
While growth is critical, not all miners are seeking to expand at all costs. Just ask Hut 8. 
The company merged with US Bitcoin Corp. in November. It then named US Bitcoin Corp. co-founder Asher Genoot as Hut 8’s new CEO, replacing Jaime Leverton.
Hut 8 said earlier this month it would cease mining operations at its Drumheller site in Alberta, Canada as part of a larger effort to cut inefficiencies. 
“I’m going through not just every single facility, every single category of miners and every single business line, but also every single cost center,” Genoot previously told Blockworks.

Diversifying revenue streams, as well as exploring new geographies, has also been a focus for some segment players. 
Miners have increasingly looked to support the high-performance computing (HPC) and AI sectors. 
Hive Digital Technologies rebranded last July as part of a pivot to HPC, while Hut 8 has said it also plans to boost its footprint in the growing AI infrastructure and computing markets in the coming years.  
Earlier this month, Core Scientific said it would lease up to 16 MW of capacity in its Austin data center to cloud provider CoreWeave. Possible revenue via the CoreWeave deal exceeds $100 million, the company said. 
Geographic diversity is also a way some miners have looked to gain an edge.
Marathon Digital expanded into Abu Dhabi and Paraguay last year — and signaled it is looking into Africa as another possible spot to set up operations.
Charlie Schumacher, Marathon’s vice president of corporate communications, previously told Blockworks that expanding into new regions can help improve margins and reduce concentration risk in the business.
Looking ahead
The big public miners have noted that building up balance sheet strength has been crucial as executives expect there to be more buying opportunities post-halving.
Ultimately, segment observers note that bitcoin miner consolidation appears imminent. 
Marathon executives said during a February earnings call they would look to use the firm’s balance sheet — with roughly $1 billion worth of unrestricted cash and bitcoin, as of Jan. 31  — to nearly double the firm’s hash rate to 50 EH/s by the end of 2025.

Riot Platforms ended 2023 with $597 million in cash on its balance sheet, and held 8,067 BTC at the end of February — worth roughly $550 million.
The company intends to use that capital to help it reach 38 EH/s by the end of 2025, Riot executives note.
Core Scientific CEO Adam Sullivan told Blockworks that the company is set to focus on opportunistically buying machines from struggling miners unable to afford parts of their existing orders after the halving.
Read more: Core Scientific CEO: Machine buys, deleveraging key around Bitcoin halving
While Hut 8’s Genoot said the firm will look to invest in growth going forward, its decision to build scale or buy scale will depend in part on cost. 
The company’s recently announced 63 MW build-out in Texas was expected to cost $275,000 per megawatt — roughly 40% less than the roughly $460,000 per megawatt that Marathon spent on two mining facilities in December. 
“We’re very active in the M&A markets, but we’re also very cost-conscious,” Genoot said previously. “We’re not going to overpay because we know what the cost is to develop ourselves as well, so we’re running both in parallel very aggressively.”

MicroStrategy Stock (MSTR) Trades at an Unjustifiable Premium to Bitcoin (BTC) Price: Kerrisdale Capital

“The days when MicroStrategy shares represented a rare, unique way to gain access to bitcoin are long over,” the note said, adding that “bitcoin is now easily obtainable through brokerages, crypto exchanges and more recently low fee exchange-traded products (ETPs) and exchange-traded funds (ETFs).”

Floki Inu price prediction after $2 billion added in a month


A common feature of cryptocurrency bull markets is the emergence – and resurgence – of various meme coins and the associated rags-to-riches and riches-to-rags stories.
The ongoing crypto market surge is no different and has already featured a massive meme coin rally early in March in which the internet-joke-based cryptocurrencies briefly dominate the weekly charts. 
It also saw the release of multiple new meme coins and the creation of several new millionaires out of investors who timed their trades particularly well with some of the most notable examples being associated with Dogwifhat (WIF) and the mishap-ridden Slerf (SLERF).


One of the mainstays of the lineup, however, the viking dog-themed and Elon Musk-inspired Floki Inu (FLOKI) has, in many ways, been the start of recent weeks. 
The token, which tries to differentiate itself from the crowd with various Web3 projects including those linked to non-fungible tokens (NFTs), games, and educational platforms, has been experiencing a massive and protracted surge in the last 30 days. 
On February 27, Floki Inu’s market cap stood at just under $475 million, and, by press time on March 28, it skyrocketed to $2.465 billion – nearly $2 billion in one month. 
FLOKI market cap 30-day chart. Source: CoinMarketCap
FLOKI’s surge initially took off on March 2 after the proposal to burn approximately 190 billion tokens – about 2% of the circulating supply – was approved by the community. 
FLOKI price chart
Along with the staggering market cap rise, the price of Floki Inu tokens also skyrocketed in the last 30 days. Within the time frame, FLOKI rose 426.60% from approximately $0.00004533 to $0.0002508.
FLOKI 30-day price chart. Source: Finbold
The 30-day surge even briefly saw Floki Inu strive to surpass its old all-time highs above $0.00031 in 2021 near mid-March, but the token retraced since. 
Still, Floki Inu’s ultimate potential upside is difficult to predict as it already broke above its established first resistance level of $0.000240, is trading close to its second resistance of $0.000254, and has proven its ability to break above the third resistance at $0.000262, though it couldn’t maintain the high level.
Nonetheless, despite the correction, FLOKI’s uptrend remains strong and it is 10.85% in the green on the weekly chart. The latest 24 hours of trading were also positive for the token as it is 12.35% in the green in the time frame.
The performance indicates that the current trend – likely to be bolstered in April by the ripple effects of the Bitcoin (BTC) halving – might prove strong enough for FLOKI to surge significantly above its old highs.
Longer-term, Floki Inu has also been doing well – much like most other cryptocurrencies – and has surged 615.87% year-to-date (YTD) and is up just over 700% in the last 52 weeks.

Kerrisdale Capital Is Short MicroStrategy Stock, Long Bitcoin: 'Things Have Gotten Carried Away' - MicroStrategy (NASDAQ:MSTR) - Benzinga

Short-selling investment firm Kerrisdale Capital has MicroStrategy Inc MSTR in its crosshairs. The short seller released a bearish report on the stock Thursday and announced a short position as part of a pair trade.What To Know:  MicroStrategy serves as a proxy for Bitcoin BTC/USD. The recent boom in crypto markets helped spark a more than 200% rally in MicroStrategy stock since the start of the year. Kerrisdale Capital believes the move higher is overdone. “We are long bitcoin and short shares of MicroStrategy, a proxy for bitcoin which trades at an unjustifiable premium to the digital asset that drives its value. Shares of MicroStrategy have soared amid a recent rise in the price of bitcoin but, as is often the case with crypto, things have gotten carried away,” the short seller said.Kerrisdale Capital claims that bitcoin would need to be trading at $177,000 right now in order to justify the current valuation of MicroStrategy.Benzinga reached out to MicroStrategy for comment, but the company did not immediately respond.MicroStrategy stock used to offer investors a unique way to gain access to bitcoin, but the asset is now easily obtainable, especially given the recent approval of several spot bitcoin ETFs, the short seller said. “MicroStrategy's trading history and basic common sense suggests the current inflated premium will contract, much as it has on prior occasions, providing a compelling opportunity for a pair trade,” Kerrisdale said in the report.Related Link: BlackRock’s Bitcoin Bet Pays Off As IBIT ETF Crushes Records, Leaves CEO Larry Fink ‘Pleasantly Surprised’Kerrisdale Capital made it clear that its thesis is not built on a bearish view of bitcoin or MicroStrategy by itself, rather that the relationship between the two has become distorted. MicroStrategy’s software analytics business only represents about 3% of the company’s total enterprise value and much of the bitcoin the company has acquired was paid for through debt financing and equity offerings, which has diluted shareholders. Kerrisdale claims that although MicroStrategy’s bitcoin holdings have increased, the amount of bitcoin per share has remained “virtually unchanged” in recent years. Other arguments for MicroStrategy’s premium include the ability to reinvest cash flows from the software business, lack of management fees, liquidity and ease of trading, but Kerrisdale believes all of those arguments are weak. MicroStrategy currently trades at a 2.6x equity premium to bitcoin, which is well above the historical average of 1.3x and even above the 2x premium it has been at or below on 94% of trading days since 2021, Kerrisdale said. “Assuming the premium to NAV reverts to more historically consistent averages implies a 50% return,” the short seller said.

FTX Hearing Started: Judge Cornered SBF! Here's What the Judge Said! - Bitcoin Sistemi

The cryptocurrency exchange FTX, which suddenly went bankrupt in November 2022, caused a major collapse in the market and investors suffered huge losses.
While FTX's bankruptcy had a shocking effect on the market, its founder Sam Bankman Fried was arrested. SBF, who has been detained since then, appeared before the judge again today regarding the charges against him.


According to information reported by Inner City Press, at the SBF hearing, Manhattan judge Lewis Kaplan stated that Sam Bankman-Fried lied to him several times during the case.
At that point, the judge said SBF lied when it claimed it had “no knowledge” that hedge fund Alameda was using FTX customer deposits until the fall of 2022.





Sam Bankman-Fried again said he was “sad” about what happened at today's hearing.
Here are the highlights of what Judge Lewis Kaplan said about SBF's defense:



“I reject the defense's claim regarding the loss, both in terms of law and facts.
The claim that customers and creditors will be paid in full is misleading.
SBF's crimes included the defendant SBF taking money from FTX customers to whom it had no right to do so.
A thief who takes what he steals to Las Vegas and successfully places a bet is not entitled to a sentence reduction, even if he pays back.
“We estimate that investors lost $1.7 billion, lenders lost $1.3 billion, and customers lost $8 billion following FTX's bankruptcy.”

Ethena Protocol announces the airdrop of the ENA token

Ethena, a high-performance protocol that leverages the concept of synthetic dollar, has just announced the launch of its governance token ENA, which will be distributed to its community through an airdrop.
Anyone who has participated in the incentive campaign and has farmed “shards” is eligible to redeem the cryptocurrency, which will be available from April 2nd.
Let’s see below how Ethena works and the details of the inauguration of the new token.

Ethena: what is this $1.4 billion yield protocol?
Ethena is a yield protocol, which introduced for the first time in the history of DeFi the concept of synthetic dollar with the digital resource USDe, with which returns are generated from innovative hedging strategies and from Ethereum staking.
Ethena is betting everything on USDe, which represents the cornerstone currency of the project, built to be scalable, stable, and resistant to censorship.
It is an algorithmic stablecoin, which maintains its peg through a sophisticated delta-hedging mechanism with collateral in ETH.
The protocol, thanks to its stablecoin, offers an investment tool called “Internet Bond”, which provides a 10% yield to USDe holders, composed of the returns from liquid stakes in Ethereum staking, combined with the activity of arbitrage of the funding rate in derivatives of the same currency.
The LST resources that Ethena invests in are: stETH, cbETH, rETH, WBETH, fxsETH, and BETH.The platforms where it goes to do short hedging for each collateral position in ETH are Gmx, Dydx, Binance, Okx, Deribit, Bybit, Bitmex, Synthetix, Bitfinex, and others.

We underline that short hedging is carried out using 1X leverage and serves to support the peg of the stablecoin in case ETH were to lose value too quickly.
If indeed the price of ETH falls, short positions become profitable, causing the peg stand to compensate for the erosion of the cryptocurrency.
This mechanism helps the financial stability of Ethena, which, although not exempt from major systemic implosion risks, can be considered “safer” than the Terra/Luna ecosystem (which fell into disgrace precisely because of its algorithmic component).

From a practical point of view, users can mint USDe simply by depositing staked Ethereum (stETH), without any lock-up constraints.
Subsequently, by staking USDe for sUSDe, users are able to effectively take advantage of the yield promised by the protocol. This kind of  “Token Vault” model ensures that the staked USDe generate a yield by automatically compounding profits.
The innovation introduced by Ethena and its high profitability have allowed the protocol to grow significantly in recent months, reaching a total of over 100,000 active users and a TVL of 1.37 billion dollars, which corresponds to the supply of its stablecoin.
Obviously the intrinsic risks presented by Ethena are blatantly evident: it will be interesting to see if the protocol will be able to survive even in bear market conditions, or if it will meet the same fate as other similar ones that have tried in vain to beat the benchmark with promises of overly optimistic returns.

Ethena (ENA) token launch set for April 2nd with accompanying airdrop: check your eligibility
The strong attractiveness of Ethena that allowed the platform to attract billions of dollars in capital, is not only due exclusively to the high yield offered but also to the airdrop campaign that the protocol is carrying out and which is now almost coming to an end.
Yesterday in fact Ethena Labs announced the launch of their governance token ENA, with a distribution through airdrop scheduled for April 2nd.
Everyone who has supported the protocol up to now, by staking USDe and participating in the “shards” campaign, is eligible to redeem a portion of the 750 million ENA tokens put up for grabs by the project team.
This represents 5% of the total supply of the new cryptocurrency, which amounts to 15 billion tokens. Initially, the circulating supply launched on the market will be 1.425 billion tokens.
We expect a market capitalization of about 1 billion dollars at launch, which translates to a likely price of 0.70 per ENA.

To check their eligibility, users can visit the website claim.ethena.fi, currently inaccessible but will be open the day before the airdrop distribution.
It will be possible to claim for the next 30 days; all unclaimed tokens will then be used in a second season of incentives or reassigned to other eligible users.
Meanwhile, it is important to emphasize that those who unlock or sell all their USDe before the date of April 2nd, will lose the associated rewards.As clearly described in the blog post announcing the launch of the ENA token:
“Any user who completely exits any of the incentivized pools by selling the system before the end of the shard campaign will lose all their shards. If you have repositioned between USDe, sUSDe, LP pool or Pendle, you will still receive your shards.”
It should also be noted that the first 2000 wallets by shard number will have 50% of the airdrop locked in vesting for a period of 6 months, with the other 50% sellable immediately.
All other users will not have any blocking constraints.

Ethena Labs announces 750 million ENA airdrop for its community - CoinJournal



                    

                    
Ethena Labs has announced that the ENA airdrop is set for April 2, with trading on exchanges also open.
Eligible Shard Campaign participants will be airdropped tokens amounting to 750 million, or 5% of ENA supply.

Ethena Labs is set to mark the next step in its decentralization with one of the biggest airdrops in the crypto market.
The Ethena Labs team announced that the highly anticipated ENA token airdrop happens next week, on April 2. Trading on crypto exchanges also opens on the day.
Per the update, the DeFi protocol’s community will receive a distribution of 750 ENA tokens, which represent 5% of the total supply of 15 million ENA tokens.
ENA distribution follows Ethena’s mainnet launch in February and marks the end of the project’s “Shard Campaign”. 
Users’ engagement and accumulation of “shards” ends on April 1, allowing the community to claim ENA tokens from April 2.
ENA airdrop: Who’s eligible?
According to an announcement from Ethena Labs, airdrop eligibility will be pegged on users’ shards accumulation up to the snapshot date on April 1. During this program, the USDe stablecoin’s supply rose to over $1.38 billion.
Participants must have held onto their staked USDe to qualify. Unstaking or selling USDe before this date will see participants become ineligible for the ENA airdrop.
However, following an exploit on DeFi protocol Prisma Finance, a “21 day lock on the mkUSD<>USDe pool on Ethena” was lifted. The exploit on Prisma on Thursday saw more than $10 million in assets stolen and the Ethena team acknowledged the need to allow users immediately withdraw their funds.
“Users will not lose any shards or accrued rewards for withdrawing from this pool,” Ethena Labs posted on X.

We are aware of the ongoing issues with our friends at @PrismaFi
The 21 day lock on the mkUSD<>USDe pool on Ethena has been lifted with immediate effect so users can withdraw as required
Users will not lose any shards or accrued rewards for withdrawing from this pool https://t.co/NEGXegqMVp
— Ethena Labs (@ethena_labs) March 28, 2024

Notably, the top 2,000 wallets eligible for the airdrop will receive 50% of their allocation and have the other 50% subject to a 6-month vesting schedule.
The remaining wallets, which are currently eligible for smaller allocations, are set to enjoy the full liquidity of airdropped tokens starting April 2.

Degen Chain Debuts on Base as 'Blockchain Equivalent of Las Vegas' - Decrypt

One of the most active and fastest-growing communities in the Farcaster ecosystem is getting its own layer-3 blockchain. The Degen chain was announced today by pseudonymous founder Jacek and infrastructure provider Syndicate, debuting with its native gas token DEGEN, touted as “one of the first community tokens with its own L3.”The Degen movement launched in January with a channel on Farcaster, a decentralized and blockchain-based social network on Base, the Ethereum layer-2 incubated by Coinbase. Frequently positioned as a crypto-friendly alternative to Twitter, Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin is a Farcaster fan, and the release of Farcaster Frames in February made it especially attractive to software developers.Since token claims opened in January, 53,000 DEGEN holders have already made over 553,000 transactions, Syndicate said, mostly tipped as a reward for posting quality content. A dedicated Degen blockchain was the next logical step.“It’s designed to be a vibrant playground for developers and a gateway for users to safely experiment with their funds,” Jacek told Decrypt. “Picture it as the blockchain equivalent of Las Vegas—less about gambling, more about the thrill of exploration and fun.”With Degen chain, crypto developers can tinker with various community management and engagement models, including tipping, community rewards, payments, and gaming.Designed as an “ultra low cost” layer-3, the Degen chain uses Arbitrum's Orbit architecture, its affiliated AnyTrust protocol to ensure data availability, and the Ethereum layer-2 Base—released by exchange giant Coinbase last fall—to settle transactions.Syndicate cofounder Will Papper said he was excited to work on a community-centric blockchain and provide “all of the tools and infrastructure to not only make the chain easy-to-use but also unlock new capabilities.”“Layer 3s are the next frontier for fully on-chain experiences, games, and applications,” Papper said. “We can't wait to see all of the new things that can only be developed on an L3 with Degen chain.”Syndicate is also tapping its experience with layer-3 infrastructure technologies ranging from Conduit for transaction rollups, Decent for the bridge, and Airstack APIs. The company also unveiled its Frame L3 for Farcaster developers last month. With the launch of Degen chain, the company is offering a free plan to allow developers to test drive the tech stack.Jacek said the point is to have fun, not to take tokens to the moon.“Whether returning with gains or not, the key is the enriching experience and connections made along the way,” he said.Stay on top of crypto news, get daily updates in your inbox.

Hedgeye Claims Reddit is 'Grossly Overvalued', Insiders Sell Shares After IPO - Tokenist


					
Neither the author, Tim Fries, nor this website, The Tokenist, provide financial advice. Please consult our website policy prior to making financial decisions.



Reddit Inc. (NYSE: RDDT) has made headlines since its blockbuster IPO, but only some of the attention has been positive. The social media giant’s stock has experienced significant volatility, with insider trading and overvaluation concerns taking center stage. As top executives, including CEO Steve Huffman, CFO Andrew Vollero, and CTO Christopher Slowe, sell substantial amounts of stock, questions arise about the company’s future performance.



Meanwhile, Hedgeye Risk Management has labeled Reddit as a potential short idea, suggesting that the stock is grossly overvalued and could face a 50% downside. As the market digests these developments, Reddit’s stock price has dropped 7.74% to $53.28 at 9:36 a.m. EDT.



Reddit Stock Sees Significant Insider Trading After Blockbuster IPO



Reddit’s top executives have engaged in significant stock transactions since the social media firm’s public debut, with CEO and President Steve Huffman leading the charge.



Huffman sold 500,000 shares at an average price of $32.30, resulting in a transaction valued at approximately $16.15 million. Following the sale, Huffman directly owned 710,306 shares, indicating that the transaction represented about 41.3% of his total holdings.



Chief Financial Officer Andrew Vollero and Chief Technology Officer Christopher Slowe also participated in the selling spree. Vollero offloaded 71,765 shares at the same average price as Huffman, generating roughly $2.32 million from the sale.



After the transaction, Vollero retained 681,660 shares directly, marking the sale as approximately 9.5% of his total shares. Meanwhile, Slowe sold 185,000 shares at $32.30 each, totaling approximately $5.98 million, representing a significant portion of his combined direct and indirect holdings of 443,752 shares.



On the buying side, Chief Accounting Officer Michelle Marie Reynolds and Director Robert A. Sauerberg made notable purchases. Reynolds acquired 3,000 shares at $34 each, totaling $102,000, which adjusted her direct holdings to 96,413 shares. Sauerberg also invested an additional $340,000 in Reddit, purchasing 10,000 shares at $34 each, bringing his post-transaction direct and indirect holdings to 57,087 shares.





Hedgeye Names Reddit as a Short Idea, States Stock is “Grossly Overvalued”



Hedgeye Risk Management has identified Reddit Inc. as a potential short idea, suggesting the stock could face a significant downside of approximately 50%. In a recently released report, the firm characterized Reddit’s stock as “grossly overvalued” and argued that it should trade closer to its initial public offering (IPO) price of $34.



Hedgeye analyst Andrew Freedman expressed concerns about Reddit’s future performance despite the stock’s initial positive trajectory following its IPO. Freedman pointed to the potential for revenue and user growth deceleration in the latter half of 2024 and the first half of 2025 as key factors contributing to the firm’s bearish outlook on the social media platform’s stock.



Reddit Inc. saw a significant drop in its stock price, with shares trading at $53.28 as of 9:36 a.m. EDT, down $4.47 or 7.74% from the previous close.

Trader Turns Bullish on Altcoin Amid Breakout of Accumulation Range, Maps Path Forward for Sei and Gala - The Daily Hodl


								A widely followed cryptocurrency analyst and trader is expressing bullish sentiment on a top-30 altcoin by market cap.
The trader pseudonymously known as Altcoin Sherpa tells his 212,600 followers on the social media platform X that Internet Computer (ICP), a blockchain project whose aim is to replicate the internet’s speed, power and scale on decentralized networks, appears to have completed a consolidation period that begun earlier in the year.










“ICP: This looks like it’s finished its multi-week accumulation period, it’s time to go.
This is one to actively trade for the next few weeks in my opinion.”
Source: Altcoin Sherpa/X
ICP is trading at $19.40 at time of writing, up by around 72% in seven days.
Next up is the layer-one blockchain Sei (SEI). Altcoin Sherpa says that he expects SEI to continue trading in a range that started forming 83 days ago.
“SEI: Nearly three months in this trading range with some deviations to the upside. Expecting more chop on this one for a bit.”
Source: Altcoin Sherpa/X
SEI is trading at $0.845 at time of writing.
Next up is the native token of the Gala (GALA) blockchain gaming platform. Altcoin Sherpa says that GALA, which is 92% below its all-time high price of $0.825 reached in November of 2021, presents an attractive upside opportunity.
According to Altcoin Sherpa, the risk-reward ratio of Gala is “not bad”.
“GALA: Some of these coins have a long way to go to former all-time highs. Not saying they’re going to get anywhere close to it but the upside is definitely good if these projects still have some money in the bank + catalysts + kept building in the bear market.”

The collaborations of Polyhedra Network

Polyhedra Network, in collaboration with EigenLayer and Renzo, has emerged as a pioneering force, introducing innovative solutions that enhance interoperability, security, and economic participation among chains. 
At the forefront of this innovation is zkBridge, a revolutionary protocol that facilitates secure and decentralized transmission of messages across different blockchain networks. In the dynamic landscape of blockchain technology, interoperability and security are essential for the smooth operation of decentralized ecosystems.

The collaboration of Polyhedra Network
zkBridge by Polyhedra Network represents a significant step forward in the blockchain sector, offering a decentralized solution for bridging assets across Layer 1 and Layer 2 networks. 
The collaboration with EigenLayer and the integration of the Liquid Restaking Token (LRT) ezETH by Renzo further strengthen the capabilities and security of the zkBridge ecosystem. This collaboration is supported by an impressive economic participation of 1.8 billion US dollars, ensuring a solid crypto-economic security.
Bitcoin, despite its importance in the cryptocurrency space, does not have a native smart contract functionality, which poses challenges for its integration into cross-chain ecosystems. 
However, zkBridge by Polyhedra Network, in collaboration with EigenLayer and Renzo, offers innovative solutions to securely connect Bitcoin to different blockchain networks. Integrating Bitcoin into zkBridge allows other blockchains to interact securely with Bitcoin, promoting low-trust interoperability.
Thanks to EigenLayer’s double-staking mechanism, zkBridge ensures the economic security of Bitcoin’s active validation services (AVS). Validators, equipped with both ZK tokens and Renzo’s ezETH, play a crucial role in ensuring the network’s integrity. In case of malicious activities, users can initiate zkBridge requests to correct discrepancies, safeguarding the network’s integrity and users’ assets.
The slashing mechanism built into Bitcoin AVS acts as a strong deterrent against fraudulent activities, ensuring the integrity of the network. Through careful monitoring and reporting, users contribute to the detection of harmful behaviors. In case of confirmation, the slashing protocol is executed, leading to the confiscation of stakes by dishonest validators. Furthermore, rewards are distributed to stakeholders and honest users, incentivizing active participation and promoting a robust ecosystem.
Fast purposes for Layer 2 networks
Layer 2 networks offer scalability and high transaction speed, but pose interoperability issues between chains. To solve this problem, zkBridge introduces a fast bridging solution that leverages an auxiliary validation network. 
This network attests the state of level 2 networks, ensuring fast finalization while maintaining security levels comparable to native blockchain executions. By simulating blockchain executions, zkBridge achieves fast finalization, significantly reducing transaction finalization time.
The integration of zkBridge with Layer 2 networks involves the verification of state proofs by auxiliary validation networks and the validation of Layer 1 consensus for Layer 2 transactions. Batch proofs are supported to reduce gas costs, improving efficiency and scalability. Through collaboration with EigenLayer, Polyhedra Network introduces dual staking on various blockchains, leveraging ZK tokens for economic security and ecosystem growth.
Renzo’s integration with ezETH enhances the dual staking mechanism, improving economic security and user experience. Renzo’s LRT mechanism incentivizes validators, mitigates risks, and offers liquid restaking capabilities, promoting greater participation and liquidity within the ecosystem. By abstracting complexity and ensuring seamless integration, Renzo enhances the efficiency and security of cross-chain transactions.
Conclusion
The integration of zkBridge, EigenLayer, and Renzo by Polyhedra Network sets a new standard for interoperability, security, and user experience of cross-chains. Thanks to innovative solutions such as zero-knowledge proofs, AVS, and dual staking mechanisms, zkBridge facilitates cross-chain transactions securely and efficiently. 
This collaboration opens up new opportunities for decentralized finance and digital asset management, driving the evolution of blockchain technology towards greater scalability, interoperability, and user empowerment. With a constant focus on innovation and security, Polyhedra Network, EigenLayer, and Renzo pave the way for a decentralized future powered by protocols that reduce trust and seamless cross-chain transactions.

Bitcoin and Ethereum Trade Sideways as Crypto Market Cools Down - Decrypt

The cryptocurrency market witnessed a slight cool-down today, with the total market capitalization dropping 1.14% to $2.76 trillion according to Coingecko. This minor correction follows significant movements in the market over the past few days, as Bitcoin and Ethereum face resistance at key levels.Bitcoin, the world's leading cryptocurrency, has been attempting to break past the $70,000 barrier. However, this level has proven to be a strong resistance, with breakouts often followed by corrections that impact the broader crypto market. Today, Bitcoin experienced a 1.2% decline, with the coin reaching a daily high of $71,754 before correcting to $69,793. Despite the recent dip, Bitcoin's overall performance remains bullish, as it continues to recover from a flash crash on BitMEX that caused the price to plummet to $60,760.Image: TradingviewThe current daily candlestick suggests a possible correction, but the overall trend remains bullish.Bitcoin's price is trading above its EMA10, a positive sign for the coin because it signals that, at current prices, any investor that bought in the last 10 days should be in the green. With 97.7% BTC addresses being in the money according to data provided by IntoTheBlock, some short-term traders may be considering realizing their gains, while long-term hodlers may still be compelled to keep their tokens locked and see how markets behave. In terms of indicators, the recent market cooldown has brought balance to the markets. The relative strength index (RSI) stands slightly bullish at 58, indicating a well-balanced market compared to the 72 points registered on March 14, when Bitcoin was trading at a similar price. This may allow for safer bullish bets in strategies that take market sentiment into consideration.The average directional index (ADX) has dropped to 30 points, signaling that while the bullish mood persists, traders are more cautious, and upswings are not as extreme as in previous days. If Bitcoin fails to gain momentum, immediate support is found around $67,800, set by the EMA10. However, if bullish momentum continues, resistance is expected between the psychological $70K zone and the $73,794 all-time high.Ethereum, the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, is exhibiting similar behavior to Bitcoin.The coin is currently trading at $6,543, having spiked to $3,663 before correcting to a minimum of $3,495 today. Overall, Ethereum is down 1.35% in the last 24 hours. The coin has faced strong resistance at $3,660 over the past three days, with the overall pattern showing more stability. This is not good for scalpers and day traders thinking about opening long positions.Image: TradingviewEthereum remains bullish, but the gap between the EMA10 and EMA55 is closing rapidly, which could indicate a price correction is still in play. The RSI has dropped to 52, suggesting that markets are currently indecisive, with no clear dominance from either bulls or bears.The ADX (which measures the strength of a trend) at 38. Combined with a squeeze momentum indicator—which guesses the phase of the market cycle an asset is being traded on—it shows bears are still not conceding to a price rebound. It also shows that traders may still be struggling to recover from the correction that began on March 12, which caused Ethereum's price to crash nearly 25% from $4,095 to $3,059.While both Bitcoin and Ethereum face resistance at key levels, their overall trends remain bullish. However, traders thinking about opening long positions on short timeframes must be cautious, as recent corrections are strong enough to stop the coins from continuing their path to price discovery zones once again.Edited by Stacy Elliott.Stay on top of crypto news, get daily updates in your inbox.

KuCoin, one of the leading cryptocurrency exchanges, has reported a staggering outflow of $1.78 billion from the Ethereum and Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) chains.According to on-chain analytics firm Nansen, there has been an outflow of over $842 million on Ethereum and $938 million on EVM chains over the last 24 hours, amounting to a total of $1.78 billion.Estimated from an initial $6 billion base in holdings, this represents more than a 15% drop in assets held by the exchange. According to Nansen, a look at chains beyond Ethereum and other chains like Bitcoin and Solana indicated a drop of $818 million.Since the news broke that KuCoin and two of its founders had been charged with breaking anti-money laundering rules by U.S. federal prosecutors, there has been an increase in withdrawals from the platform. The exchange also recorded outflows of stablecoins in response to the news.On Tuesday, U.S. prosecutors charged KuCoin and two of its founders for failing to comply with U.S. anti-money laundering rules. The Commodity Futures Trading Commission, which controls derivatives markets, filed a lawsuit against the firm on the same day.KuCoin CEO reacts"As the People's Exchange, we prioritize user asset security above all else. All operations, including deposits and withdrawals, are normal," Kucoin CEO Johnny Lyu said in a reassuring statement to users, while adding that legal matters were being handled by the legal team.Lyu added, "The challenge we're facing is not unique to KuCoin but rather typical growth and regulatory issues encountered by emerging industries. Early-stage development often sees regulatory gaps, but as the industry matures, we move towards and embrace compliance and standardization."KuCoin is one of the largest spot crypto exchanges in the world, with a daily trading volume of more than $2 billion, according to CoinMarketCap. The exchange holds over $6 billion in assets across Ethereum, Bitcoin, Solana and other chains.

FTX Creditors Likely To Be Paid up to 140% the Value of Their Original Claims: Report - The Daily Hodl


								FTX’s bankruptcy estate is primed to pay its creditors more than the value of their original claims, according to the Financial Times.
Citing two people “with knowledge of the restructuring negotiations,” FT reports that the imploded crypto exchange will likely pay its former customers 120-140% of the value of their holdings on the day FTX filed for bankruptcy in November 2022.










The increased payouts are thanks to soaring crypto prices and FTX’s 8% stake in the AI (artificial intelligence) safety and research company Anthropic. The bankrupt exchange’s administrators reportedly plan to sell two-thirds of that Anthropic stake to a group of investors for $884 million.
The size of creditor repayments hinges on whether the U.S. Internal Revenue Service (IRS) maintains its demand for $24 billion in unpaid taxes.
FTX’s legal team has also reportedly argued that the bankrupt crypto exchange owes no taxes to the IRS since it repeatedly recorded losses over its three-year lifespan.
Disgraced FTX founder Sam Bankman-Fried was found guilty late last year of defrauding investors and mishandling billions of dollars worth of customer funds related to the multi-billion-dollar downfall of the exchange in 2022.
Prosecutors have recommended a prison sentence of 40-50 years for Bankman-Fried, although the former CEO’s lawyers have reportedly argued that he should serve a maximum of 6.5 years, pointing to the size of creditor repayments.

Bitcoin price falters as macroeconomic and regulatory headwinds mount

Bitcoin (BTC) price faced a moderate correction to $68,430 on March 27 after failing to break above the $71,000 mark. Data from Bitcoin derivatives data reveal a decline in bullish sentiment among professional traders over the past week, which could possibly indicate that the $69,000 level will not hold.Bitcoin spot ETF inflows will be decisive for BTC’s priceDespite a rally from $63,800 to $70,000 in the five days leading up to March 27, only $151 million in leveraged short positions were forcibly closed in the BTC futures markets. This suggests that bears remained cautious, even in light of last week's significant $888 million net withdrawal from U.S. Bitcoin spot exchange-traded funds (ETFs).On a positive note, Bitcoin has demonstrated resilience by recovering from a 17.6% drop from $73,757 on March 14 to $60,795 on March 20 without causing panic among spot ETF investors. However, some market observers argue that the primary driver behind BTC reaching a new high before the April Bitcoin halving was the unexpectedly high inflows into spot ETFs, highlighting the importance for bulls to monitor such trends.A positive for Bitcoin enthusiasts, this week saw a reversal in spot ETF flows, with a total of $418 million in net inflows recorded on March 26. Crucially, this was not due to reduced outflows from Grayscale's GBTC, indicating genuine institutional demand even as Bitcoin's price lingered just 4% below its peak. However, this does not assure professional traders that $69,000 will serve as a support level.Analysts can discern whether whales and arbitrage desks are adopting a bullish or bearish stance by analyzing aggregated positions across spot, perpetual, and quarterly futures contracts.Exchanges’ top traders BTC long-to-short ratio, 12 hours. Source: CoinglassOn Binance, the long-to-short ratio among professional traders was 1.50, favoring long positions on March 22, a figure that has slightly decreased to 1.42 currently. On OKX, the sentiment was much more bullish on March 22, with a long-to-short ratio of 3.22, a sentiment that has since diminished, with the ratio currently at 1.49 in favor of longs. This indicates a notable reduction in optimism among top traders, despite the 9.5% price increase during the period, suggesting other factors may be dampening bullish sentiment.Global economic concerns and mixed market signals impact Bitcoin price Some analysts argue that the global economic downturn is impacting Bitcoin's performance, particularly after the S&P 500 index could not maintain its all-time high of 5,320 achieved on March 21. The uncertainty surrounding the U.S. Federal Reserve's interest rate decisions for 2024 is causing investors to lose confidence; rate cuts are generally seen as positive for risk-on assets like Bitcoin. According to the CME FedWatch Tool, which reflects the expectations of the fixed-income markets, there's only an 8% chance of a rate cut at the Federal Reserve's May 1 meeting.Furthermore, analysts caution that a Fed rate cut may signal troubles rather than prosperity. Paul Hickey, co-founder of Bespoke Investment Group, shared his concern over the lack of earnings growth posing the greatest risk to the stock market. He also highlighted worries about the overemphasis on artificial intelligence, which has significantly propelled the stock market's recent gains.Related: Massive Bitcoin consolidation sparks sell-side liquidity concernsData on Bitcoin's top traders indicates a decrease in the preference for leveraged long positions, differing from an increase in bears’ comfort. This shift may stem from simultaneous all-time highs in diverse asset classes, including gold, U.S. stocks, Bitcoin, Japan's Nikkei 225 index, and live cattle, suggesting market anticipation of a weaker U.S. dollar against scarce resources.The diminished interest in leveraged BTC longs should not alarm investors, nor a signal that Bitcoin will trade below $69,000, as it likely reflects broader economic recession concerns and external pressures, such as the U.S. Justice Department's charges against KuCoin exchange on March 26 and the European Parliament's committee discussions on limiting cryptocurrency payments from self-hosted wallets.This article does not contain investment advice or recommendations.

Here’s Why The Cardano Price Is Struggling Below $0.7


                            A plausible explanation has emerged for why the Cardano (ADA) price has dropped below the psychological price level of $0.7. The crypto token saw a sharp correction from its monthly peak of $0.8, recorded on March 14, and has since failed to recover such a height. 
Cardano Whales Responsible For Price Decline
Data from the crypto analytics platform Santiment shows that the whale transaction count ($100,000 and above) on the network has reduced since March 14. That period was when Cardano hit a high of $0.8, which suggests that ADA whales began to take profits from then and have slowly exited their positions since then. 

Crypto whales are known to have a massive impact on the market, and prices usually drop as soon as these traders begin to offload their holdings. Moreover, this wave of profit-taking isn’t peculiar only to the ADA ecosystem; these past few weeks have been marred by investors taking profits from different crypto tokens in which they were invested. 
The flagship crypto, Bitcoin, was also not spared. Investors decided to take profits after weeks of seeing BTC make a parabolic run on its way to a new all-time high (ATH) of $73,750. Meanwhile, long-term ADA holders also looked to have used the opportunity to take some profits, as data from Santiment shows that a considerable amount of dormant ADA tokens were also transacted during that period.
Specifically, March 20 was a busy day for these long-term holders as 200 million ADA tokens (which had been dormant for a year) moved on that day. 
Time For ADA To Run To $1
Like the broader crypto market, Cardano looks to be recovering from this recent wave of profit-taking, although at a slower pace. For its next leg up, there is the belief that the crypto token could finally break the $1 resistance. Crypto analyst Dan Gambardello recently predicted that ADA could rise to between $1.4 and $1.5 if it can break out from the $0.8 price range. 

ADA whales are likely to soon return to the fold with whale transctions higher than $100,00 expected to pick up soon enough. A spike in these trasaction count would suggest that these investors are taking advantage of ADA’s current decline to accumulate more of the crypto token. That is something that could contribute to a rise in ADA’s price depending on how bullish these investors are on ADA going forward. 
At the time of writing, ADA is trading at around $0.6513, down almost 4% in the last 24 hours according to data from CoinMarketCap.

UK crypto firm Copper pictured hosting party with nude sushi servers


UK crypto firm Copper, which is chaired by the country’s former chancellor Sir Phillip Hammond, has raised eyebrows after hosting a private dinner party at a luxury London hotel that served guests sushi on two partly naked models.
Copper invited guests to the crypto conference after-party at the five-star Mandrake Hotel last week and promised that “Attendees will be able to entertain and explore all five senses,” and “Transcend the ordinary at the Copper experience.” 
The Financial Times obtained a picture of the event during which one male and one female model, seemingly dressed in thin bodysuits, can be seen semi-naked serving sushi off their bodies. 
Photo of the Copper dinner party shared with the Financial Times. 
The event is reminiscent of nyotaimori, an old Japanese custom where sushi is served to guests from the bodies of laid-down naked women. 
Crypto dinner party more ‘art’ than ‘seedy’
A person close to Copper told the Financial Times the dinner party was “a lot of razzle-dazzle . . . more performative art than anything seedy.” They said the models were “wearing swimming costumes,” and that Copper’s chairman, Hammond, didn’t attend. 
In addition, a Copper spokesperson told the Financial Times, “As part of our sponsorship of the Digital Assets Summit 2024, we jointly hosted an after-party held at the Mandrake Hotel.” It said the event “was organized by a third-party event planner and open to all delegates as part of the conference.”

Copper offers various financial entities the ability to trade crypto on exchanges. It was founded by Dmitry Tokarev in 2018 and has been chaired by Hammond since 2023.  
The firm was reported to have sent $4.2 million worth of ETH to Jonatan Zimenkov, a member of a Russian arms dealing network controlled by his father. In addition, Copper has been accused of acting as an intermediary in a shares sale to help a Russian oligarch skirt US sanctions.

SUI Token Brushes $2 Peg in Rally Near All-Time High - DailyCoin


        
The SUI token has reached a new year-high trading price.



SUI has maintained a positive upward trend over the past months.



The crypto market is struggling to rebound following a week-long downward trend.
SUI, the native token of the Layer-1 blockchain and smart contract platform dedicated to digital asset ownership Sui, has thrived over the past months, outperforming most assets with new milestones in trading price and across its broader ecosystem. Despite the current cautious sentiment across the market, the native token has managed to buck the trend, notching healthy gains in recent weeks.SUI has continued the upward trajectory and breached its month-long price resistance to new heights. SUI Hits $2 in Fresh Rally StartOn Wednesday, March 27, SUI started its trading session on a strong note, rallying to a new year-to-date price high of $2.06.The surge marks a 17% increase in SUI’s price over the past 24 hours, bringing the token total gains over the past month to a healthy 28.3%.While SUI has quickly slipped below its newly reclaimed peg, the token’s bullish trend over the past three months, which has seen a staggering 143% upward notch in price, is fueling optimism regarding its ability to reclaim the peg and breach its all-time high trading price of $2.16.At press time, SUI is wavering at a trading price of $1.97, shedding nearly half of its gains over the past hour. However, despite this recent decline, the token price increase has outpaced most assets, many of which are struggling to recover from their week-long downward trend.Bitcoin Leads Market SlipFollowing an impressive rally to new price heights in the past weeks, the crypto market has experienced a bearish sentiment, with many assets slipping to new lows and surrendering gains.



Leading the charge is Bitcoin (BTC), which has slipped approximately 5.6% from its all-time high of $73,780. It is currently trading at $67,786, still marking a 10% rebound from its week-low.Other cryptocurrencies including Ethereum (ETH) and Solana (SOL) have dropped by approximately 14% and 11% from their year-high trading prices, positioning both as some of the top losers of the past week. Cardano (ADA), Avalanche (AVAX), and Binance Coin (BNB) also joined the ranks of losers, each experiencing declines of 23%, 16%, and 9% respectively.On the Flipside

The total value locked on Sui has surged by an impressive 248% over the past three months, reaching $696 million from its year-start value of $200 million.



Sui has recently debuted its first-ever global conference in collaboration with Mysten Labs. 
Why This MattersThe surge in SUI’s price aligns highlights its ability to defy negative market trends and mount up impressive gains.

This Altcoin Announces It Will Deposit Assets Into BlackRock's Cryptocurrency Fund - The Price Soars - Bitcoin Sistemi


Ondo (ONDO) announced that it will distribute a significant portion of its OUSG (Ondo Short-Term US Government Bonds) assets to the BlackRock USD Institutional Digital Liquidity Fund (BUIDL).
Following the development, there was a sudden increase in the price of the altcoin:










 
Until now, withdrawals from the OUSG fund have been restricted by traditional “+2 days post-trade” security closing periods, causing delays in investors getting their USD back after the sale of the underlying securities.


However, with the introduction of “+1 day after transaction day” for many types of securities, ONDO believes it has the opportunity to benefit from faster processing, one of the most important advantages of blockchain.
In response, ONDO announced that OUSG will soon offer instant investment and redemption, available 24/7/365.





Additionally, ONDO is introducing a new type of OUSG, the rUSG, with a fixed issue/redemption price of $1.00 per share. Yield will be distributed daily in the form of additional rUSG tokens via token reminting.

Sam Bankman-Fried gets sentenced to prison today. What to know

Sam Bankman-Fried, the disgraced cryptocurrency executive, will receive his prison sentence on Thursday. If prosecutors get what they want, the former CEO of the failed cryptocurrency exchange FTX could serve 40 to 50 years in prison. Why Amazon stock gains are changing employee compensationHere’s what you should know.Who is Sam Bankman-Fried?Sam Bankman-Fried, also known as “SBF,” launched the cryptocurrency exchange FTX in 2019, and it went bankrupt in 2022. Born in 1992 in California, he grew up in an academic family, with both of his parents professors at Stanford Law School.He earned a physics degree with a minor in mathematics from MIT in 2014. While in the program, he worked as an intern in 2013 for the trading firm Jane Street Capital in New York. It was there that he met Caroline Ellison, who later became his girlfriend. Ellison would become the CEO of Alameda Research, a quantitative cryptocurrency trading firm and SBF’s first company, founded in 2017. It was later discovered that he built FTX to support Alameda’s trading business.What was FTX?Bankman-Fried co-founded the crypto exchange FTX in 2019 with American computer programmer Gary Wang. As the covid-19 pandemic later boosted cryptocurrency trading worldwide, FTX rode the wave. In 2020, FTX purchased Blockfolio, the market’s leading mobile news and portfolio tracking app, for $150 million. SBF appeared as a speaker at various crypto and blockchain conferences, attracting a large following.How did it collapse, and what happened next?In November 2022, the crypto news website CoinDesk reported on FTX’s poor balance sheet and liquidity crisis. Big names such as cryptocurrency exhange Binance opted not to provide any support to FTX or Bankman-Fried.The cryptocurrency exchange collapsed overnight, resulting in a loss of $10 billion in customer funds. This had a ripple effect on other crypto companies, throwing them into financial turmoil.Several companies with direct or indirect connections to FTX — including BlockFi, Voyager, Celsius, Genesis, and Gemini — went bankrupt in a matter of weeks. The cryptocurrency market saw its darkest period to-date, resulting in a loss of more than $1 trillion, and Bitcoin’s price dropped below $18,000.What was Sam Bankman-Fried convicted of?Once a crypto icon, Sam Bankman-Fried became a fraudster. Federal prosecutors filed both criminal and civil charges against Sam Bankman-Fried and other top FTX executives in late 2022. They were accused of misappropriating $10 billion in customer deposits and with generating false financial statements.The court appearances of FTX’s top executives attracted widespread attention — as did their romantic lives.In November of 2023, a federal jury in New York convicted Bankman-Fried of fraud for stealing at least $10 billion from customers and investors.What sentences are prosecutors and defense lawyers seeking?When he returns to court Thursday, Bankman-Fried will be sentenced. Prosecutors are seeking 40-50 years in prison, while Bankman-Fried’s lawyers are asking for only 5-6 years in prison. His lawyers have cited medical conditions including neurodiversity and autism, making him “uniquely vulnerable in a prison population,” as well as Bankman-Fried’s desire to make “the world a better place” and his remorse over the collapse of the crypto exchange.

$SMOG is releasing his treasure in Solana's hottest new airdrop
                        An incendiary new Solana meme coin called $SMOG is landing on a centralized exchange (CEX) “very soon” as the first season of its airdrop concludes, according to the token’s progenitors’ latest announcement on social media. The SMOG team promises the listing will be a landmark event. The announcement urges #Dragons (the pet name for denizens of $SMOG’s army) to “get ready for the first $SMOG Exchange Listing coming very soon.” While details about the listing are scarce, rumors suggest it could arrive as early as next week and may be accompanied or followed by a second CEX listing. The team also urged $SMOG holders to continue fulfilling their daily quests to earn reward points before the season one airdrop ends in just over six days. The second season airdrop will have a heavier focus on on-chain trading, the announcement says. $SMOG Takes Off
Due to their tendency to exaggerate price movements in the wider market, meme coins are known for being some of crypto’s most volatile investments. When they balloon, they can go virtually to the moon, but on a bad day meme coins can be a sink, draining value quicker than any other class of crypto.The market is crowded with dog-themed coins. Everywhere investors look, four-legged Shiba Inu lookalikes solicit their money under names like DOGE, SHIB, and FLOKI.  $SMOG is a fire-breathing dragon. His name is a not-so-hidden reference to Smaug, the fire-breathing guardian of gold in The Hobbit. But unlike Smaug, $SMOG wants to offload his treasure onto you in his upcoming airdrops. Over on $SMOG’s chart for the last month, we can see fleeting highs of $0.26 throughout much of February. However, the token is currently retracing at $0.17 as it hovers above a key psychological support before the next leg higher. Source: TradingViewAs $SMOG wrestles with events on the broader market, data by CoinGecko puts the token 330% higher than it was 30 days ago, a clear sign of the surging demand. Two narratives will gain traction in crypto over the next two months and affect prices across the market: Bitcoin’s halving and the possibility of an Ethereum ETF. Bitcoin’s halving on Apr 19, 2024 will slash mining rewards in half, causing a supply squeeze as the market has to adjust to the institutional demand created by the launch of eleven spot Bitcoin ETFs back in January. Halvings have historically caused Bitcoin rallies, which have gone on to add value to the whole market. The following month, the SEC will decide whether to approve or reject Ethereum ETF applications, meaning that market narratives will powerfully supplement $SMOG’s standout meme appeal in the near term. Is $SMOG One Solana Airdrop To Rule Them All?
Ethereum has long been the number one blockchain for token creation, but Solana is giving it a very strong reason to watch its back. That’s because Solana meme coins have risen in popularity recently, with names like DogWifHat, Bonk, and Slerf posting some eye-watering rallies recently. $SMOG launched on the Jupiter decentralized exchange (DEX) on February 7, 2024. Known by its clarion call: “no meme coin can survive the fiery flames of SMOG”, the token encourages community building and engagement through its ambitious airdrop. Interested investors wishing to participate in “The Greatest Solana Airdrop of All Time” (according to its makers) campaign, need to fund a Solana-compatible wallet with either SOL, USDT, or BONK, which can then be spent on SMOG via the Jupiter DEX aggregator or Birdeye.Each $SMOG token grants its holder access to ‘The Dragon’s Court’ crypto community – making their wallets eligible to earn rewards in the airdrop program. Users can stake their $SMOG for a vesting period of 90 days to earn rewards, or they can join the community on Zealy to complete daily quests and community tasks that will boost potential airdrop earnings. Engage with the community on X (Twitter), Discord, and Telegram so you don’t miss out on any news or updates.You can read the Litepaper to find out more.

SingularityNet, Fetch.AI, Ocean Protocol merger will drive decentralized AI development: ChainGPT CEO

The upcoming token merger of prominent artificial intelligence (AI) protocols SingularityNet, Fetch.ai, and Ocean Protocol will set a new standard for decentralized AI development, Ilan Rakhmanov, the CEO and founder of ChainGPT, told Cointelegraph in an interview. He explained:“This move is likely to drive high-level development resources and creative collaboration toward the goal of decentralized AI development. By pooling expertise and technologies, the merger could establish new standards for decentralized AI that enhance security, privacy, and transparency.”The $7.5 billion AI token merger was confirmed on March 27, hours after reports started emerging of the potential deal. The three protocols are united by the common goal of developing blockchain-based decentralized AI protocols, which can't be controlled by centralized parties or large stakeholders.The high-level merger is a testament to the benefits of decentralized AI over its centralized counterparties, according to ChainGPT’s Rakhmanov:“AI is frequently becoming second nature to users in their personal, professional, and private lives. That means the security of user’s information is paramount. A robust decentralized platform for AI, free from centralized control, is an ambition worth pursuing!”The decision of the protocols was announced during a period of growing interest in AI protocols, a week after reports of the Saudi Arabian government considering the creation of a $40 billion investment fund for AI development. The fund would launch in partnership with Silicon Valley venture capital firm Andreessen Horowitz (a16z).The fund could take place in the second half of 2024. If approved, this would make the Saudi government the largest investor in the AI space.Related: Biden administration takes action to safeguard public from AI risksThe AI token merger is the ultimate path for ecosystem growth and long-term value accrual, according to Alexandre Dreyfus, the CEO and co-founder of Chiliz, who told Cointelegraph:“I’m interested in the fact that tokens would merge, but each company would stay independent, and all their efforts would be done on the same token & ecosystem. This is the future of token M&A.”If the upcoming AI token were to hold its fully diluted valuation of $7.5 billion, it would become part of the 20 largest cryptocurrencies by market capitalization, according to Dreyfus.Related: Marc Andreessen, Galaxy Digital, Accolade, back new $75 million crypto fund: Report

SBF Sentenced to 25 Years in Prison-How Many Will He Actually Serve? - Decrypt

On Thursday morning, a Manhattan federal judge handed Sam Bankman-Fried a 25 year prison sentence for his criminal involvement in fraud and conspiracy at FTX. But how many years is the disgraced crypto founder likely to actually serve in a federal prison? The answer is fairly easy to determine, given the rigid codes and calculations used by the Federal Bureau of Prisons to evaluate prisoners, incentivize them, and manage their sentences. Because Bankman-Fried received a sentence longer than one year, he will likely receive an automatic 15% sentence reduction, Christopher Zoukis, a federal prison consultant, told Decrypt. Pieces of that 3.75 year reduction can then be added back on to the FTX founder’s prison stint if he gets into any serious trouble while incarcerated.Beyond that 15% reduction, however, Bankman-Fried is almost certain to spend most of the remaining 85% of his sentence—a hefty 21.25 years—in federal custody, per Zoukis. There are only a handful of exceptions and credit programs that could shorten the former billionaire’s stint in a federal prison. And even in a best-case scenario, such reductions could shave off only a year or two of time—no more. Other American prison systems, like California’s, for example, can remove huge chunks of felons’ ordered prison time—half of a sentence, or more—based on good behavior and other factors.“The federal prison system doesn't do that,” Zoukis said.If Bankman-Fried complies with the First Step Act, a relatively new law that further incentivizes good behavior in prison, he could earn up to a year of additional sentence reduction. If he demonstrates a verifiable substance abuse disorder, and treats it through a residential prison program, he could shave off another year. But that’s pretty much it. Even in the best-case scenario; even if Bankman-Fried can prove he’s a full-on stimulant addict and seeks treatment; even if he’s granted all sentence reductions available to him under federal law; even if he acts impeccably in prison for years, teaching a whole generation of inmates about the wonderful world of investing, he’s still locked in for over 19 years in a federal prison.And in all likelihood, that penitentiary—which it’s looking like he’s set to call home at least until he turns 51 years old—is set to be a pretty rough one.Edited by Ryan Ozawa and Andrew HaywardStay on top of crypto news, get daily updates in your inbox.

Bitcoin Pump-and-Dump Alleged as Nilam CEO Quits - DailyCoin


        
Nilam Resources announces ambitious 24,800 Bitcoin buy plan.



The company CEO departs amid odd circumstances.



Concerns grow over market manipulation.
Nilam Resources ignited a firestorm in financial markets this week with its bold announcement to acquire 24,800 Bitcoins. The audacious crypto bet sent Nilam’s stock price soaring over 1,800% as investors piled in. However, the company has been involved in controversy after CEO Ron McIntyre abruptly resigned, raising questions about corporate governance and blockchain credibility.Bitcoin Used in Pump-and-Dump: McIntyreDays after Nilam’s Bitcoin acquisition announcement, McIntyre resigned and moved to distance himself from the company, saying, “it’s a classic pump-and-dump.”  Worse still, McIntyre revealed that the scheme was orchestrated without his knowledge or approval. The former CEO had no doubts that “There will be a FINRA investigation into Nilam Resources” over this matter.Cybersecurity engineer Matt C accused Nilam of tricking influencers who then amplified the dubious news before verifying, dubbing it “the real #Bitcoin cheat code.” The bizarre sequence of events has put the spotlight back on sensationalist reporting and negligent social media amplification catalyzing wild market moves.Holding 24,800 BTC would rank Nilam as the second biggest public company holder of Bitcoin, behind MicroStrategy and ahead of industry titans such as Galaxy Digital and Marathon Digital, even Coinbase. However, McIntyre’s departure has confirmed what some suspected, that the Bitcoin acquisition announcement was a publicity stunt designed to manipulate the company’s stock price.Publicity Stunt ConfirmedEven before McIntyre’s resignation, Nilam’s Bitcoin announcement drew intense skepticism from market watchers, who suspected market manipulation. Crypto investor Mike Alfred mocked the announcement to convey his doubts that Nilam could pull off such an audacious $1.7 billion play.
Others highlighted oddities in Nilam’s press release, including naming Nilam’s CEO as Pranjali More rather than McIntyre, fueling suspicions of a pump-and-dump in action. According to the press release, Nilam intended to complete the Bitcoin purchase via a complex deal involving offering preferential shares to the shareholders of a special purpose vehicle that holds the BTC. On the Flipside
Legitimate corporate Bitcoin buys typically involve raising debt or equity financing in advance.



This saga has done little to legitimize digital assets in the eyes of crypto skeptics.



Nilam stock has crashed back down to pre-BTC acquisition announcement levels.
Why This MattersWhether motivated by opportunism or sheer incompetence, Nilam’s dubious Bitcoin bid, followed by the CEO’s abrupt exit, raises serious accountability concerns. This unsettling episode could invite further regulatory scrutiny on an industry already facing heightened oversight pressures.

Bitcoin: Here's how far along we might be in the bull cycle - AMBCrypto



BTC ETF flows could impact Bitcoin’s “cyclicality”
Popular analyst claimed we’re less than 40% into the bull cycle

Traditionally, Bitcoin [BTC] has a strict four-year market cycle that surges during the halving event. Based on this market cycle theory, altcoin season always starts as capital rotates from BTC to Ethereum [ETH] and finally, to the rest of the altcoins. 
However, this cycle could change immensely due to massive U.S spot BTC ETF inflows. 
In a recent forum discussion on the impact of spot BTC ETFs, Galaxy Digital CEO of Europe, Leon Marshall, highlighted that the ETFs could alter Bitcoin’s  “cyclicality.” 
“I think it will probably change the cyclicality of Bitcoin’s industry. That means slightly less Bitcoin-ETH-Altcoins as a rotational cycle.” 
He added that the next cycle could be driven by “When is the next ETF?” 
In other words, Marshall means that the next cycle could be determined by ETF approval, such as for ETH, Solana [SOL], Litecoin [LTC], etc. 
Bitcoin’s “altered” cycle
Interestingly, Quinn Thompson, founder of Lekker Capital, shared similar observations in a recent podcast with Galaxy Digital’s Head of Research, Alex Thorn. Thompson noted that the ETFs impact BTC in several ways, namely,
“One, it adds correlations; sometimes, it could be inversely correlated.”
Thompson also expounded that BTC had some past correlations with Nasdaq, tech, and AI stocks. On some occasions, BTC showed correlations with Gold, which makes tracking it from multiple angles crucial for maximum trading potential. 
Additionally, he underscored that ETF inflows have an impact on BTC prices to some extent. 
“We’re beholden to the flows of the ETF, and that cuts two ways.”
When asked what stage the bull cycle is at the moment, he added,
“I think we’re later on what people would think as a traditional four-year cycle than expected.” 
On the contrary, Rekt Capital, a pseudonymous crypto researcher and trader on X (formerly Twitter), religiously follows the traditional cycle. At the time of writing, Rekt Capital was claiming that the cycle is only up 35%, meaning that a rally of over 60% is expected based on the traditional cycle. 
At press time, BTC was hovering at around $70K. Tracking it from the traditional cycle and new nuances is critical to spotting opportunities and risks.

Shiba Inu Team Launches Latest Edition Of The SHIB Magazine | Bitcoinist.com


								The Shiba Inu team has published the 18th edition of The Shib Magazine, featuring DAMN, the newest meme coin integrated into the Shibarium ecosystem. The publication emphasizes the latest developments and updates on the token, accentuating its impressive achievements and performance in the crypto space.
Shiba Inu Magazine Unveils The Solana Killer, DAMN
On Wednesday, March 27, The SHIB team released the latest edition of its magazine, focusing exclusively on the SOL Killer, DAMN. Highlighting the rapidly growing popularity of the cryptocurrency, The Shib Magazine disclosed that DAMN has become one of the major meme coins of interest to investors in the crypto space. 

Delving deep into the story behind DAMN’s inception, the Magazine revealed that Woof, a pseudonymous developer of WoofSwap, a community-driven Decentralized Exchange (DEX), had been the first to introduce the idea of creating a new meme coin exclusively for the Shibarium network. Taking advantage of the recent hype on meme coins in the market, the developers proceeded to create DAMN, recognizing the market’s interest in meme coins as an opportunity for explosive growth. 
According to the magazine, DAMN was a token created through the general collaboration of the entire Shiba Inu community. After its successful inception, developers relinquished ownership of the meme coin, burning all Liquidity Provider (LP) tokens in order to enhance transparency and improve security by eradicating the potential for rug pulls and scams.  
In an effort to bolster the cryptocurrency’s adoption and elevate its visibility, the Shiba Inu army had united in support of the meme coin, promoting it through social media platforms like X (formerly Twitter) and submitting requests to leading cryptocurrency aggregators such as CoinMarketCap and CoinGecko. 
As a result, DAMN underwent a substantial growth spurt, skyrocketing by more than 500% and reaching a trading volume of over $3 million within five days of its launch. The cryptocurrency has garnered considerable attention and engagement within the crypto community, capitalizing on the heightened demand for new and potentially lucrative meme coins to propel itself to new heights. 
DAMN’s Unique Qualities As A Meme Coin
One of the unique characteristics of DAMN as a meme coin is its inherent ability to bolster the Shibarium ecosystem. As the cryptocurrency gains momentum, it shines the spotlight on Shibarium, boosting the network’s popularity and adoption. 

According to The Shib magazine, DAMN has been one of the key players in Shibarium’s rapid growth lately. The Shiba Inu Layer 2 blockchain solution has witnessed a major increase in its Total Value Locked (TVL), achieving an impressive high of $3.79 million, at the time of writing. 
DAMN has also played a potential role in boosting the network activity within the Shibarium ecosystem. The Layer 2 blockchain recently recorded a series of milestones, attributed to the introduction of its new meme coin and the ecosystem’s resilience and steadily growing user base.

Sam Bankman-Fried sentenced to 25 years in prison in FTX collapse

Sam Bankman-Fried, the disgraced cryptocurrency executive who was convicted of fraud in the spectacular collapse of the crypto exchange FTX, was sentenced to 25 years in prison on Thursday. The sentence, handed down by a federal judge in New York, capped an incredible fall from grace for a young financier who was once the poster boy for the emerging crypto industry before he joined the likes of Bernie Madoff as one of America’s biggest financial fraudsters ever.Why Amazon stock gains are changing employee compensationBefore he was sentenced, Bankman-Fried addressed the courtroom and apologized.“A lot of people feel really let down, and they were very let down, and I am sorry about that,” he said. “I am sorry about what happened at every stage. And there are things I should’ve done and things I shouldn’t have.”He said FTX’s downfall’s “haunts” him every day and that he repeatedly made bad decisions while leading the company. He said seeing FTX customers suffer was painful. “My useful life is probably over,” he said. “It’s been over for a while now.”Besides the prison sentence, Judge Lewis Kaplan also ordered a forfeiture of $11.2 billion in assets. But with so many victims, he said restitution would be impractical in this case. Prosecutors had sought 40-50 years in prison, while Bankman-Fried’s lawyers asked for only 5-6 years in prison. His lawyers had cited medical conditions including neurodiversity and autism, saying they made him “uniquely vulnerable in a prison population.” His lawyers also argued that the bankruptcy process would compensate victims for any losses.But Kaplan disagreed.“I reject entirely that there was no actual loss,” Kaplan said Thursday.Kaplan found that Bankman-Fried falsely testified that he did not know FTX’s sister company Alameda had spent FTX customer deposits before the crypto exchange collapsed. The judge found that Bankman-Fried’s crimes resulted in losses to victims of more than $550 million — the maximum finding allowed under federal sentencing guidelines. Investors lost $1.7 billion, Alameda lenders lost $1.3 billion, and FTX customers lost $8 billion, the judge said.And Kaplan agreed with prosecutors that Bankman-Fried wanted to become a powerful politician, an ambition that helped drive his crimes.Nicolas Roos, a federal prosecutor in the case, argued that FTX was infused with criminality throughout its creation.“Sam Bankman-Fried stole over $8 billion in customer money, and I emphasize stole because it was not a liquidity crisis, or an active mismanagement, or poor oversight from the top,” Roos said Thursday. “It was not a bloodless financial loss on paper.”Bankman-Fried’s lawyer Marc Mukasey said in court that his client is not a “ruthless financial serial killer.” He said Bankman-Fried is misunderstood and still believes that if he had the time, he could have fixed the issues that felled FTX.“He’s an awkward math nerd,” Mukasey said. “He loves video games and veganism, and he’s compassionate to animals.” The prison sentence quickly drew criticism from cryptocurrency industry insiders who called it too light.“Justice is not served,” said Terrence Yang, managing director of the  Bitcoin financial services firm Swan Bitcoin. “The damage SBF did was permanent and severe. He ruined a lot of families and lives with his felonious acts and put salt in the deep wounds with his total lack of remorse.”Bankman-Fried, also known as “SBF,” launched the cryptocurrency exchange FTX in 2019. As the COVID-19 pandemic later boosted cryptocurrency trading worldwide, FTX rode the wave. In 2020, FTX purchased Blockfolio, the market’s leading mobile news and portfolio tracking app, for $150 million. Bankman-Fried appeared as a speaker at various crypto and blockchain conferences, attracting a large following.But in November 2022, the crypto news website CoinDesk reported on FTX’s poor balance sheet and liquidity crisis. Big names such as cryptocurrency exchange Binance opted not to provide any support to FTX or Bankman-Fried.FTX quickly collapsed, resulting in a loss of $10 billion in customer funds. This had a ripple effect on other crypto companies, throwing them into financial turmoil. Several companies with direct or indirect connections to FTX — including BlockFi, Voyager, Celsius, Genesis, and Gemini — went bankrupt in a matter of weeks. The cryptocurrency market saw its darkest period to-date, resulting in a loss of more than $1 trillion, and Bitcoin’s price dropped below $18,000.Federal prosecutors later filed both criminal and civil charges against Sam Bankman-Fried and other top FTX executives in late 2022. They were accused of misappropriating $10 billion in customer deposits and with generating false financial statements. The court appearances of FTX’s top executives attracted widespread attention — as did their romantic lives.In November of 2023, a federal jury in New York convicted Bankman-Fried of fraud on seven different fraud and conspiracy charges and stealing at least $10 billion from customers and investors.Born in 1992 in California, Bankman-Fried grew up in an academic family, with both of his parents professors at Stanford Law School. He earned a physics degree with a minor in mathematics from MIT in 2014. While in the program, he worked as an intern in 2013 for the trading firm Jane Street Capital in New York. It was there that he met Caroline Ellison, who later became his girlfriend. Ellison became the CEO of Alameda Research, a quantitative cryptocurrency trading firm and SBF’s first company, founded in 2017. It was later discovered that he built FTX to support Alameda’s trading business.

BREAKING: Sentence of Former FTX CEO Sam Bankman-Fried Announced! Here is the Time He Will Serve in Prison! - Bitcoin Sistemi

The judge sentenced FTX's former CEO Sam Bankman-Fried, who was accused of fraud, to 25 years in prison.
According to the judge's recommendation, SBF will serve his sentence in a prison close to his family in the San Francisco Bay Area.


Prosecutors had previously requested a 40-year prison sentence. According to the rules, the punishment was life imprisonment.
Judge Lewis Kaplan announced his decision following a hearing in a Manhattan courtroom following Bankman-Fried's conviction on seven felonies in November, a year after FTX filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy.





The former FTX CEO is expected to appeal Kaplan's conviction, a process that should not begin until after the sentencing decision.
Bankman-Fried was facing up to a hundred years in prison based on his parole officer's report. Kaplan did not adhere to this advice. While Bankman-Fried's defense team, a different group of lawyers from those who represented him during the five-week trial, did not seek a sentence of more than 6.5 years, prosecutors from the US Department of Justice requested a prison sentence of 40 to 50 years.


How long will Sam Bankman-Fried, who was sentenced to 25 years in prison, actually spend time in prison?
Because Bankman-Fried received a sentence longer than a year, he will likely receive an automatic 15% sentence reduction.
Part of that 3.75-year discount could be added to prison time if the FTX founder gets into serious trouble while in prison.





But beyond that 15% reduction, Bankman-Fried will almost certainly spend most of the remaining 85% of his sentence (a hefty 21.25 years) in federal prison.
There are only a few exemptions and loan programs that can shorten SBF's time in federal prison. And even in the best-case scenario, such reductions may shorten the period by only a year or two.

This collective rise in dog coins is reflective of a broader trend in the crypto market.With X/Twitter's new payment branch being awarded more licenses in the U.S., many are speculating about the implementation of crypto payments on the platform.  Positive expectations around this speculation have triggered a rise for Dogecoin, which has spilled over to other dog coins, including BONK.BONK steadily ticked higher after a rebound from lows of $0.00002144 on March 23. From this date, BONK is set to mark five out of six days in green, with today's gain being the largest.In an astounding rise, BONK jumped from a low of $0.000025 to reach a high of $0.000029 in Thursday's trading session. The rise also coincides with positive sentiment for Bitcoin, which has regained the $71,000 mark.At the time of writing, BONK was up 14% in the last 24 hours to $0.0000291; the token was likewise higher by 25% weekly.The enthusiasm for dog coins is indicative of a wider appetite for risk among investors, who are increasingly looking for high-growth opportunities within the crypto market.

U.S, UK Pursue $20B Crypto Transfers Sent Via Garantex - DailyCoin


        
Two governments are reportedly probilling billions in crypto transfers. 



The transfers were sent via a sanctioned exchange. 



Sources familiar with the matter said a stablecoin was used in the transfers. 
The U.S. and UK are reportedly investigating digital asset transactions worth billions sent through Russia-based crypto exchange Garantex using a dollar-pegged stablecoin.The U.S. Treasury’s Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) sanctioned Garantex and Hydra Market in April 2022 due to their alleged connection with ransomware gangs and dark net drugs markets. While the exchange was founded in 2019 in Estonia, the U.S. claims most of its activities are now based out of Federation Tower in Moscow.Probing $20B Crypto Transfers to Garantex  According to a Bloomberg report on March 28, the U.S. and UK are jointly “reviewing” over $20 billion of cryptocurrency transactions believed to have been sent through Garantex using Tether’s stablecoin USDT.Citing people familiar with the matter, the report said the payments under probe took place after Garantex was sanctioned by the U.S. and UK on suspicion of enabling illicit transactions and financial crimes in Russia.Per the source, while the $20 billion crypto transactions would represent among the biggest breaches of the sanctions imposed on Russia since the start of the war in Ukraine, it is “too early to anticipate conclusions” given the complexity of digital asset payments.The source further intimated that the inquiry has yet to arrive at an “immediate suggestion” of wrongdoing by USDT issuer Tether. In response, the report quoted Tether saying that it has worked with law enforcement to freeze the assets of entities with addresses listed on the U.S.’s sanctions list.

Is Ethereum (ETH) Eyeing $4,100 Amid Post-Consolidation?


Considering the Pi Cycle Top Indicator, the ETH price analysis suggests that Ethereum could see more corrections before attempting to reach the $4,000 mark again. Additionally, the Net Unrealized Profit/Loss (NUPL) indicates it’s still distant from the euphoria zone, hinting at a potential period of consolidation in the near future. 
Furthermore, the Exponential Moving Average (EMA) Lines reveal prices converging closely, suggesting that there is strong support at the current levels, which may stabilize ETH prices before any significant upward movement.
Ethereum Pi Cycle Shows An Important Scenario
ETH trajectory on the Pi Cycle Top Indicator suggests a brewing consolidation phase, as evidenced by the gap between the 111-day moving average and the 350-day moving average times two. 
Currently, the indicator’s upper boundary is set near $4,231, while the lower boundary rests around $2,750, a spread that allows for a breathing room indicative of market stabilization rather than a peak. It’s within this bandwidth that the ETH price could be carving out a foundation for its next ascent.
ETH Pi Cycle Top Indicator. Source: Glassnode. 
Pi Cycle Top Indicator operates on the principle that when the price surpasses the longer-term average (350-day multiplied by 2), a market top could be imminent, suggesting an overheated market poised for a downturn. When it’s below the short-term average, it could indicate the asset is undervalued. 

ETH price between these averages and the parallel trajectory of the lines without a crossover event implies that while the heights of market euphoria are yet to be reached, the groundwork is being laid for a robust support level. This lack of convergence, combined with the current price activity, lends weight to the argument that ETH could be entering a consolidation phase.

ETH Is Still Far From Euphoria
ETH Net Unrealized Profit/Loss (NUPL) has been consistently oscillating between “Optimism — Anxiety” and “Belief — Denial,” a pattern that is indicative of the market’s indecision. Such a rhythmic shift between sentiment zones suggests that investors are alternating between cautious optimism and a stronger conviction in the asset’s potential, yet without fully committing to an overarching trend. This back-and-forth movement, or ‘going and coming,’ implies a potential consolidation phase for Ethereum.
ETH Net Unrealized Profit/Loss. Source: Glassnode. 
The NUPL’s brief stays in “Belief — Denial” to prevent market overheating. The sentiment suggests a market stabilizing, avoiding big sell-offs or selloffs.

This sentiment balance may prep ETH’s price for steady climbs. Without strong greed or fear, a gradual rise is more likely than volatile swings.
ETH Price Prediction: Consolidation Before New Surges
ETH Exponential Moving Average (EMA) lines on the 4-hour price chart provide valuable insight into the asset’s price action. The EMA lines are tracking close to each other, which indicates that there’s little volatility and the price is experiencing a consolidation phase. 
EMAs are a type of moving average that gives more weight to recent prices, making them more responsive to new information. When EMA lines converge, as they seem to be on the chart below, it often signifies that a strong trend is not in place, and prices could move sideways for some time.

ETH 4H Price Chart and EMA Lines. Source: TradingView. 
The price of ETH is hovering around these lines, suggesting an equilibrium between buyers and sellers. If an uptrend is to commence, a decisive break above these tangled EMA lines could propel ETH’s price toward the $4,100 resistance level. An upcoming ETH ETF could help this uptrend to appear. 
Read More: Ethereum Restaking: What Is It And How Does It Work?
If the consolidation phase turns bearish, ETH could drop to $3,200 support. A deeper slide to $2,900 is possible under wider negative sentiment. Currently, clustered EMA lines hint at ongoing range-bound trading for Ethereum. Any decisive move out of this band will likely define its next major price trend.

Ethereum Validators Surpass 1M with $117,090,569,200 Locked - Coin Edition


							


Ethereum validators have surpassed one million, locking over $117 billion.



Lido stands out among the primary validators, holding the largest share at 30%.



The most significant inflows to the ETH staking contract have been attributed to Ether.Fi, Lido, and Renzo.





Recent statistics have shown that validators on the Ethereum network have crossed the 1 million threshold, with multi-billion dollars locked on the Beacon Chain. Evan Van Ness, Ethereum’s Former Chief Decentralization Officer, called attention to this development in a recent post on X.



Van Ness cited statistics aggregated by analyst Hildobby via the data analytics platform Dune, which shows that ETH validators now exceed 1,000,911.







At press time, the updated records show that Ethereum has 1,002,488 validators who have staked 32,079,608 ETH tokens on the network. Considering ETH’s market value of $3,650, the monetary value of the staked tokens amounts to a staggering $117,090,569,200.



Lido Finance stands out among the primary validators within the Ethereum network, holding the largest share at 30%. Following closely are centralized exchanges Coinbase and Binance, with 14% and 3.85% respectively. Notable contributors to the roster of ETH validators also include Kraken, Upbit, and Frax Finance.



According to data from the on-chain analytics platform Nansen, there has been a consistent increase in the number of ETH tokens locked in the Ethereum staking contract over the past year.



For instance, the Ethereum staking contract held 28.98 million tokens two months ago. Also, a year ago, it contained 18.4 million ETH. The latest record indicates that this figure has nearly doubled since last year.



Over the past three months, the most significant inflows to the Ethereum staking contract have been attributed to Ether.Fi, Lido, Renzo, Mantle, and Everstake. Among these, Ether.Fi stands out with the highest net positive flow of 776,767 ETH, equivalent to over $2.83 billion. Lido witnessed substantial net inflows of $1.67 billion through the same period.

Dogecoin Primed For Gargantuan '$1 DOGE' Upsurge After Barreling Past 22 Cents For First Time Since 2021 ⋆ ZyCrypto

&nbsp

&nbsp
The price of canine-themed meme coin Dogecoin (DOGE) jumped double digits Thursday to break past $0.22 for the first time since December 2021. The uptick comes amid speculation about DOGE’s use on Elon Musk’s social media giant X.



X Payment Integration Prospects



On March 28, the Dogecoin price hit as high as $0.2212, before settling at $0.2189 at publication time. The one-time joke cryptocurrency last hit 22 cents in December 2021.



DOGE’s price was up 18.8% from the previous day and has risen 40.2% over the past week, according to data from CoinGecko. This price action has seen Dogecoin outperform most of its top-ranking rivals, including Bitcoin and Ethereum (ETH) in a 24-hour timeframe. Dogecoin’s market cap of $31.4 billion places it as the ninth most valuable cryptocurrency.



DOGE started rebounding after its biggest proponent, billionaire Elon Musk, secured three more money transmitter licenses from Illinois, New Mexico, and Oregon in the United States to implement a payment feature on X.



Musk registered for licenses in over 30 states. He has been given the nod in 23 states so far. These licenses have been deemed bullish for Dogecoin amid increasing hopes that Musk will add DOGE to X’s forthcoming peer-to-peer payment functionality.

&nbsp



“Last year, Elon mentioned that the first phase of X Payments would not include crypto — I am not sure if this has changed now,” industry pundit Mishaboar postulated. But he suggests that Musk could integrate cryptocurrencies such as Dogecoin to X payments after partnering “with some exchanges or brokerage platforms.”



Earlier this month, Musk hinted at his openness to accepting DOGE as an official payment method for Tesla cars.



Adding to the bullish sentiment is the news that America’s largest crypto exchange, Coinbase, intends to launch futures trading products for DOGE as soon as April 1.



After successfully blasting through the $0.20 barrier, there is hope that Dogecoin could soon see a potential rise to the coveted $1 mark and higher levels.

US Treasurys tokenized on public blockchains top $1B

United States Treasurys tokenized on public blockchains surpassed $1 billion as traditional financial firms continued to load securities on-chain amid a prolonged period of elevated interest rates.Data compiled by 21.co and Dune Analytics shows that tokenized government securities stood at $1.07 billion in assets on March 28, distributed across 17 products. A majority of the assets are based on the Ethereum, Polygon and Stellar networks.Leading the issuers is investment firm Franklin Templeton, with over $360.1 million in assets and 33.6% of the market share through its Franklin OnChain U.S. Government Money Fund (FOBXX). Using the Polygon and Stellar blockchains, the tokenized fund launched in 2021 and is represented by the BENJI token. The second position is held by BlackRock's USD Institutional Digital Liquidity Fund, or BUILD, with $244.8 million worth of assets tokenized, representing 22.8% of government Treasurys on-chain. Tokenized U.S. government securities by product. Source: 21.co/Dune Analytics.Treasurys are debt securities issued by the U.S. federal government. Investors lend money to the government by buying these securities, and in return, the government promises to pay back the principal amount on a specified date, along with interest.Due to the rise in interest rates in the United States in recent years, government treasuries have become more attractive to investors from a risk-return perspective. As of March, the U.S. Federal Reserve has maintained its benchmark interest rates at a 23-year high between 5.25% and 5.50% to control inflation. Blockchain-based digital tokens representing U.S. Treasury securities rose 641% in 2023. Tokenizing U.S. Treasurys on a blockchain involves creating digital tokens that represent ownership of the underlying security. It impacts the way securities are issued, traded and managed, offering more liquidity and allowing investors with less capital to participate. Major financial institutions like UBS and JPMorgan have ventured into asset tokenization, with projects aimed at bridging traditional financial assets and blockchain technology. Crypto projects are also diving into tokenized U.S. Treasurys to back up their operations. Decentralized finance platform Ondo Finance, for instance, is now the largest holder of BlackRock's BUILD, holding 38% of the fund’s supply, according to Tom Wan, data analyst at 21.co.

Bitcoin Surges Past $71,000, Signaling Bullish Momentum and Potential for Record Highs



                    
Bitcoin recently marked a significant milestone by closing above $69,000 on March 25, indicating a bullish momentum reclaiming an important resistance zone. 



This event, as reported by Cointelegraph Markets Pro and TradingView, registered BTC/USD’s highest daily closure in nearly ten days, demonstrating a notable uptrend. 




The surge was particularly catalyzed by a positive shift during the initial Wall Street trading session, where Bitcoin’s value increased by up to $4,600 within a single day. 



This momentum carried forward, propelling Bitcoin past the $71,000 threshold subsequently.



Financial commentator Tedtalksmacro highlighted a shift in the market dynamics, pointing out that U.S. spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) experienced net inflows after a week of negative flows and significant withdrawals from the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC). 




He shared, “After 5 consecutive outflow days, Bitcoin spot ETFs saw +$15.4M USD flow in on Monday. +262M from Fidelity. 



“The bid is back.”

Despite the continued large outflows from GBTC, amounting to $350 million, BTC/USD managed to overcome these potential hindrances, signaling strong market resilience.



Market analysts are looking at the developments with an optimistic lens.



Matthew Hyland, a well-known trader and analyst, speculated about the potential for Bitcoin’s price to reach the $100,000 mark, especially if the current momentum can clear significant resistance areas. 



He underscored this possibility based on a reset of a classic Bitcoin price metric that had previously aligned with a notable increase in Bitcoin’s value. 



The daily relative strength index (RSI), a key indicator of market momentum, also showed promising signs, although it remained below the threshold typically associated with bull market conditions.



Analyst Mark Cullen, however, cautioned about potential volatility, pointing to “gaps” in the CME Group Bitcoin futures markets that could act as short-term price targets. 



A specific gap below $64,000 was identified as unfilled, suggesting possible price movements. 



Conversely, Daan Crypto Trades downplayed the immediate impact of these gaps, suggesting that significant breakouts often leave such gaps unfilled without necessitating immediate corrections, thus indicating a less pressing concern for a potential price dip in the near term.

Sui Surpasses $700M In TVL as Token Reclaims $2 Peg - DailyCoin


        
Layer-1 chain Sui’s TVL has surged impressively since the start of the year.



The SUI token recently brushed its previous ATH as it hit a new price milestone.



Sui has outpaced notable chains in its ongoing TVL rally.
Sui, the newcomer Layer-1 blockchain and digital asset ownership-focused smart contract platform has maintained an upward momentum over the past months, marked by new milestones in token price and Total Value Locked (TVL). Within a year of launch, Sui has recorded remarkable growth, earning a spot among the top-performing chains in the decentralized finance field.Further solidifying its position, the MOVE technology-powered blockchain has hit a new milestone.SUI TVL SkyrocketsAccording to decentralized finance analytics platform DefiLlama on Thursday, March 28, the total value locked (TVL) on Sui has reached an all-time high, surging past $724 million. This marks a healthy 243% increase from Sui’s New Year’s Day value of $211 million and an approximate 2093% surge in the past six months, securing the chain’s position as the 12th largest in the ecosystem.Sui has surpassed notable chains, including PulseChain, Aptos, and Cardano, which currently sit at 13th, 14th, and 16th place, respectively, with values of $558 million, $498 million, and $414 million.Sui’s parabolic run extends to its native token, which also recently clocked a new milestone in price performance.SUI Briefly Reclaims ATH, Hits New PegIn the early hours of Wednesday, March 27, SUI stunned the markets with a strong trading kick-off, surpassing the $2 peg for the first time in over five months.
Following a price retest at $2.00, SUI proceeded to surge past its previous all-time high trading price record of $2.16, briefly hitting a 2.1709 mark.
While SUI has since retraced its gains to a current trading price of $2.04, the surge marks a healthy 413% rebound from its October 19, 2023 crash, when the token sharply declined to a low of$0.39.The native token of the Sui ecosystem currently occupies the 54th spot by global market cap. However, its impressive price performance fuels optimism for its potential to reclaim a position among the top 50.On the Flipside
Despite Sui’s TVL’s remarkable growth, it has yet to regain its former top 10 DeFi chain status.



Sui’s current trading price is an approximate 60% increase from its year-start trading range of $0.70 to $0.77.



Sui has recently unveiled efforts to advance Web 3 education through a collaboration with the American University of Sharjah.
Why This MattersThe surge in SUI’s TVL solidifies its position among the top chains of the year but also signifies a sustained upward momentum since its launch, charting an optimistic path for the chain, its native token, and the broader ecosystem.To further understand Sui’s journey to its $700 million TVL milestone, read here:Sui Surmounts Cardano, Aptos in TVL as DeFi Spurt EscalatesHere’s how SBF and his family aim to mitigate the consequences of his actions:SBF Supporters Use Autism as Excuse for Lenient Sentencing

Ondo Finance To Deploy OUSG Assets In Blackrock’s BUIDL Fund - The Defiant

The real-world asset protocol is also introducing instant subscriptions and redemption for its OUSG tokenized fund.Ondo Finance, a real-world asset (RWA) protocol with $220 million in total value locked (TVL), plans to reallocate the majority of assets in its tokenized U.S. Treasuries fund OUSG into BlackRock's recently launched USD Institutional Digital Liquidity Fund (BUIDL).Its flagship OUSG fund has $88 million in assets and provides liquid exposure to short-term U.S. Treasuries. According to the project, BlackRock's embrace of securities tokenization validates ONDO Finance's original concept of a tokenized US Treasury fund and reinforces the belief that the tokenization of traditional securities on public blockchains represents the next evolution in financial markets.Asset management behemoth Blackrock launched BUIDL on Ethereum earlier in March, and it has already amassed $245 million of assets, making it the second-largest tokenized Treasury product, according to rwa.xyz.Instant SettlementOndo is also launching instant subscriptions and redemptions for OUSG in response to its clients' growing demand for faster settlement processes. Traditionally, OUSG redemptions have taken a few business days due to the settlement times of the underlying securities.Additionally, Ondo will introduce a new rebasing version of OUSG called rOUSG, which will have a fixed $1.00 per share mint/redeem price and daily yield distributions in the form of additional rOUSG tokens.The protocol’s ONDO token has been a major beneficiary of the ongoing tokenized RWA boom, surging more than ten-fold since launching in January.ONDO PriceONDO commands a market capitalization of $1.3 billion as of March 28.

AI Analytics Firm Helika Launches $50 Million Crypto Gaming Accelerator - Decrypt

Helika, an AI-powered analytics firm focused on the video game industry, announced Thursday the launch of Helika Accelerate—an accelerator program aimed at supporting studios worldwide in developing blockchain games and sustaining growth in users and revenue.The initiative is backed by venture capital firms including Pantera, Spartan Capital, Sfermion, and others, who have pledged to collectively invest up to $50 million in selected studios.Helika—which has worked with such publishers as gaming giant Ubisoft and Bored Ape Yacht Club maker Yuga Labs—will provide guidance in tokenomics, chain selection, data analytics, and marketing. It will also give studios access to its AI game management platform providing insights into user behavior, NFT performance, and social media analytics.“The goal of the initiative is to address the common challenges faced by game developers, such as access to capital and strategic industry contacts, which can impede their ability to bring new and exciting games to market quickly,” Helika co-founder and CEO Anton Umnov told Decrypt’s GG. “Founders depend on so many things to go right in order to build games that people love.”Umnov added that the accelerator program’s launch “is not timed to coincide with market trends like a bull run,” but rather “reflects a long-term commitment to the gaming industry” as the company grows. It also follows a recent $8 million Series A funding round for Helika.Helika Accelerate will focus on “earlier-stage studios” that have already raised some funding, he said, and are deep into building functional games and need help with in-game economics. The company’s AI-driven analytics tools use data on player behavior and desires to help inform marketing campaigns and game design alike.While the announcement prominently notes the focus on crypto games, Umnov said that Helika Accelerate will also work with studios developing traditional video games, as well.Editor’s note: This article was written with the assistance of AI.

Bitcoin Stablecoins Ratio At 1-Yr Lows: Why This Is Bullish


								On-chain data shows the Bitcoin Exchange Stablecoins Ratio has plunged to its lowest since March 2023. Here’s what this could mean for BTC.
Bitcoin Exchange Stablecoins Ratio Has Been Heading Down Recently
As explained by an analyst in a CryptoQuant Quicktake post, the Bitcoin Exchange Stablecoins Ratio has been declining recently. The “Exchange Stablecoins Ratio” is an indicator that keeps track of the ratio between the Bitcoin and stablecoins exchange reserve.
The exchange reserve here is the total amount of a given cryptocurrency that all centralized exchanges are holding in their wallets right now. Generally, this part of the supply sitting in these platforms is considered the available trading supply of the asset.

What the trend in this indicator may imply for the market, though, depends on the exact type the cryptocurrency in question is. In the case of volatile assets like Bitcoin, investors may transfer to these platforms when they want to sell.
As such, an increase in the exchange reserve may imply that the available sell supply of the asset has gone up, which could naturally prove to be bearish for the price.
For stablecoins, exchange deposits also imply that investors want to trade from these coins into other assets or fiat. The difference, though, is that a shift of stables into other cryptocurrencies is bullish for their prices, as this swap obviously acts as buying pressure for them.
For this reason, the total exchange reserve of all stablecoins is often considered the available buying supply for the volatile side of the cryptocurrency sector.
Now, here is a chart that shows the trend in the Bitcoin Exchange Stablecoins Ratio over the past few years:

The value of the indicator appears to have been riding a downtrend in recent days | Source: CryptoQuant
As displayed in the above graph, the Bitcoin Exchange Stablecoins Ratio has been declining for a while now, but the indicator’s downtrend has especially sharpened recently.
When this indicator has a low value, it means that the BTC exchange reserve is low in comparison to that of all stablecoins right now. Since this may correspond to the ‘sell supply’ of the asset being lower than the ‘buy supply’, the indicator assuming such a value can be bullish for BTC.

According to this indicator, the potential selling pressure in the market had risen to its peak in mid-2023, but it has been on its way down since then. So far, the metric has retraced back to levels observed in March 2023.
The latest values of the indicator are still high when compared to those observed during the 2022 bear market lows, but the fact that they are only going down may be an optimistic sign.
That said, in the current post-ETF environment, it’s unclear how relevant the exchange reserves are now (and therefore, the indicator), as the ETFs offer a different avenue into Bitcoin, for which demand has been significant so far.
BTC Price
Since its initial surge beyond the $70,000 mark, Bitcoin has been stuck in consolidation during the last few days, as it’s still trading around this level.

Per a press release seen by Cointelegraph, the game features “a free-roam virtual world that begins in Wiami, a metaverse city to explore, race, socialize, and much more.“All items, equipment, land, and avatars in the world will be “tradable digital assets on the Wilder World marketplace.”According to Frank Wilder, Co-founder of Wilder World:“We’re honoured to be listed on the Epic Games store, setting the pace for next-gen gaming in the metaverse. Our mission is to create a novel experience using cutting-edge technology, offering players a virtual space for gaming, socializing, and earning.”The Wilder World team claims that the game will “combine leading game genres into a single immersive experience” to overcome what they say are the shortcomings of traditional AAA games such as Grand Theft Auto and Cyberpunk.Per the team’s roadmap, Wilder World will combine the genres of racing, mining, first-person-shooter, into a single comprehensive game.Wilder World is being built on a proprietary blockchain. According to the press release the team is “working with Polygon and Celestia to build a custom, scalable blockchain to keep its fees low; as well as working with Metagravity to power virtual worlds with thousands of players.”VIDEOThe creators behind the game also claim that it will eventually run on a proprietary cloud gaming system. Per a blog post on the Wilder world website “with the use of NVIDIA GPUs, we are in active development of our own cloud gaming service that provides increased reliability and hardware guarantees, as well as optimization for metaverse and web3 gaming.” However, the post notes that this is an early venture and goes on to say that at launch, Wilder World will be available on Nvidia’s streaming gaming service Geforce NOW.

World’s Eighth-Largest Bank Unveils Tokenized Gold Product for Retail Customers: Report - The Daily Hodl


								Banking giant HSBC has reportedly launched a tokenized gold product for its retail customers in Hong Kong as the bank and the government both push to make real-world assets available in digital form.
SCMP reports that the HSBC Gold Token, which is now available on HSBC’s online banking and mobile app, is the first tokenized gold product to be issued by the bank.










Tokenized gold is the digital representation of physical gold on a blockchain. Citing data from crypto data aggregator CoinGecko, the report says the value of tokenized gold assets surpassed $1 billion in 2023.
HSBC’s gold token is also the first distributed ledger technology-based retail product in Hong Kong as authorized by the Securities and Futures Commission (SFC).
The world’s eighth-largest bank unveils the new financial product months after revealing that it has created tokens representing gold holdings that sit inside a London vault.
Hong Kong is pushing for the rollout of more digital assets for public use.  According to the SFC, tokenized products can reduce operational costs and promote efficiency and transparency.
Says Sami Abouzahr, Hong Kong head of investments and wealth solutions at HSBC.
“Asset tokenization can enable convenient, affordable and broad access to real-world and financial assets, in this case, the HSBC Gold Token.”

Sam Bankman-Fried Deserves a Life After Prison

Demonizing SBF, sometimes called the “face of crypto,” is in effect a demonization of crypto in general. Crypto fans should hope that SBF is reformed and feels remorse in time, in the same way the industry itself should work to rid itself of fraud. I cannot comment on whether SBF’s effective altruism was ever sincere, but I want to believe there is the possibility of goodness in him, in the same way that crypto supporters believe that crypto can affect good in the world, despite its detractors.

FTX estate to unload $7.6B locked Solana balance at 68% discount

The estate of bankrupt cryptocurrency exchange FTX will sell its balance of 41 million Solana (SOL), worth $7.65 billion at the time of publication, to institutional investors at around $60, or a 68% discount to its current market price.As told by FTX creditor Sunil Kavuri during FTX co-founder and former CEO Sam Bankman-Fried’s (SBF) sentencing on March 28, not all customers have been made whole by the exchange's bankruptcy. “Sullivan & Cromwell [FTX bankruptcy counsel] has trampled over our property rights,” Kavuri alleged. “They have liquidated billions of dollars of crypto assets. There’s a token S&C sold at 11 cents; it’s now trading at two dollars. FTX had $10 billion [misprint] in Solana tokens — they sold it at 70% discount."In an earlier victim impact statement filed by Kavuri, the FTX creditor claimed that the FTX estate “owns 41.1 million Solana tokens which should be distributed to FTX creditors. They were planning to sell them for $60, the price today is $187." Despite the creditors’ claims, presiding Judge Lewis A. Kaplan reiterated that the March 28 hearing was solely for sentencing SBF, and not for raising issues with creditors’ claims. “I accept your assertion the claim customers will be made whole is inaccurate," said Judge Kaplan. At least one investor seems to have confirmed the discounted sales. On March 27, Canadian blockchain firm Neptune Digital Assets announced it had acquired 26,964 SOL at $64 per token, a 67% discount to its then-market price. Although the firm did not specify its counterparty, the terms of the sale match the offer conditions provided by the FTX estate. As per a March 7 Bloomberg report, the vesting period for the purchase of discounted SOL tokens is four years. Simultaneous to the bankruptcy proceedings, FTX creditors have filed a class action against Sullivan and Cromwell, alleging that the firm participated in the FTX fraud before it became the exchange's bankruptcy counsel. Before its collapse, FTX was an early investor in the Solana ecosystem. Related: Sam Bankman-Fried sentenced to 25 years in prison

Trading volume for Dogecoin doubles on speculation over X use

Dogecoin (DOGE) has led the way, with total volumes jumping to $9.2 billion, from the coin peaked in December 2021. This rise in digital currency is based on the recent public speculation about integrating the gem-inspired meme asset into social media platform X, owned by famous tech executive Mr. Elon Musk.Doge Rockets to record high on X integration rumorsIn the European afternoon session, DOGE made a record 22 cents, showing an incredible 17 percent surge in round-the-clock trading within a day. However, unlike the calm wave of the larger cryptocurrency sector, Bitcoin, being close to $70,000, and Dogecoin (DOGE) correlated with this scenario, it bravely continues to make waves with its dramatic rally. The sharp price surge of DOGE is largely due to the demand from bullish investors interested in the prospect of the DOGE being used on the X platform. The rumor of X taking over is on his social media posts, mostly from community members with much influence. These hints can reveal that Dogecoin’s payloads can likely be used to make payments within X. The Dogecoin engineer announced on Twitter, citing the excitement surrounding the adoption of crypto payments on the platform and recent developments in the X payment technology, such as obtaining more licenses in America. These movements in the trade volume are spectacular, as the DOGE market value was $7 billion only within the last 24 hours, and its average level was about $3 Such a sharp rise in trading volume manifests the growing number of investors and enthusiasts lining up for their preferred digital coin, DOGE, to be accepted by X. Also, open interest in futures contracts tracking the price of dogecoin has risen to about $2 bln in value on the exchanges that trade them, signifying people’s interest in their price fluctuations.Elon Musk’s influence and previous endorsement of DogecoinElon Musk’s endorsement of the cryptocurrency has amplified speculation regarding Dogecoin’s integration on X. Musk, who acquired X in 2021, has been known for supporting Dogecoin, often making public statements and tweets in its favor. Musk’s electric car company, Tesla, has been accepting DOGE payments for merchandise purchases since 2021, further cementing his association with the cryptocurrency.Dogecoin’s recent betting activity and price surge are driven by speculation surrounding its potential integration on the X platform. The bullish sentiment surrounding DOGE and Elon Musk’s influence and previous endorsement has propelled the cryptocurrency to new heights. As the crypto community eagerly awaits further developments regarding Dogecoin’s use on X, the market closely monitors the situation, anticipating potential impacts on price dynamics and market sentiment.

                        The meme coin markets on Solana continue to surge, with the latest token, Christ is King, experiencing an astonishing increase of over 770,000% in 24 hours.This article will provide an analysis of CHRIST’s current price trends, and look to see whether the latest incarnation of Dogecoin, represents a more promising investment opportunity.CHRIST’s major breakout on Solana meme coin markets comes amid a continued appetite for the latest moon-sh0t, with Christ is King rising dramatically due to sudden viral success on X.CHRIST Price Analysis: As New Solana Meme Coin Consolidates – Could This Other Coin Outperform?
With price action astride lower support, Christ is King is currently trading at a market price of $0.000109 (representing a 24-hour change of -46.84%).This comes after CHRIST launched at just 19:00 (UTC) on March 26, in a DEX listing that gained almost immediate traction – as the fresh Solana meme coin hammered up +864% in the first few hours.A strong support level was established above $0.000105, setting the stage for further gains as price exploded due to a sudden influx of more than $500k in trading volume.Prices rocketed up amid the flurry of interest, and this supercharged price action to fire up a further +1,428% – hitting an all-time high at $0.0011 around 7 AM (UTC) on March 28.Yet, with early investors sitting atop impressive 770x gains, the retracement was inevitable, and a subsequent sell-off move saw CHRIST tumble -80% to lower support at $0.000105.In a lengthy, hard-fought consolidation pattern, CHRIST token is struggling to make headway, with buy pressure dwindling to just 36% of transactions over the past hour.However, with a lowly market cap of just $457k, there is still a good degree of upside potential available if holders can trigger an influx of fresh capital.But while CHRIST holders battle on, a new meme coin presale has unlocked unhinged viral success as retail investors flock to 2024’s incarnation of the infamous Dogecoin.Supercharge Your 2024 Skyrocket With Dogecoin20: Capitalizing on the Viral Presale Hype
The recovery of meme coin markets in 2024 has been nothing less than impressive, and this resurgence is fueling interest in Dogecoin20, a new ERC-20 token currently in its presale phase – offering retail investors the chance to get in early at an ultra-low market cap.Developers describe the Dogecoin as part of the “Dogecoin family of meme coins.” However, unlike DOGE, there is more utility to Dogecoin20 holders since they can stake and earn rewards.VIDEOAdditionally, Dogecoin20 attempts to differentiate itself from other meme coins by offering a capped supply and a staking mechanism, features not present in Dogecoin. This could incentivize long-term participation and address concerns about inflation.But the real opportunity lies in Dogecoin20’s market cap (around $10m), which is just a fraction of Dogecoin’s $26.6Bn, imagine if Dogecoin20 repeated just 1% of Dogecoin’s success.That would mean a 30x return for presale investors – an easy target in bull market conditions.Dogecoin20 will likely capitalize on the “replica play” on DOGE and possibly attain the same viral success.Strategically, the meme coin creators are tapping into high expectations ahead of the Bitcoin halving event.Dogecoin20 will launch on April 20, around 24 hours after the event. Buy Dogecoin20 Here

                        Russia and the USA are expected to take the lead in crypto adoption, according to a new report published on Statista called Digital Assets: Market Data & Analysis. According to the figures, the number of crypto users in Russia could reach 38.5 million by 2027. That’s a 15% increase year-on-year (yoy) from the 19.3 million crypto users in 2022. This percentage is the highest average growth rate for any of the countries or regions surveyed in the report.That means Russia’s total number of crypto users, which at present exceeds high numbers posted by UK, Japan, Canada and Germany, will go on being the second highest in the world for cryptocurrencies, ahead of every European and Asian rival and second only to the U.S..Source: StatistaOver the Pacific, the US recorded a staggering 52.8 million crypto users in 2022, a figure which exceeds Russia’s projected 2027 figure by a fraction over 37%, indicating the world-leading scale of adoption in both the former Cold War rivals.However, adoption in the US will skyrocket too, with a near doubling over five years to a projected 102.2 million users by 2027. Altogether, the year-on-year growth rate for the US between 2022 and 2027 is 14%, which is in line with Japanese and European projections but lags 1% behind Russia.The number of European crypto users in 2022 was 101.5 million; this looks set to blow up to 191.6 million by 2027.The rest of the world will see exponential growth in crypto adoption. At present, the total number of users across all the countries that are not USA or continental Europe is 291.7 million. That figure will mushroom 20% year-on-year to peak at 729.3 million in 2027.Source: StatistaCryptocurrencies, NFTs, or DeFi?
One interesting point to observe is how the popularity of NFTs and Decentralized Finance protocol users varies by region. NFTs are undoubtedly more popular in the USA than any other region, with 0.9 million NFT users in 2022. That figure is expected to rise sharply to 1.6 million by 2027.Hardly anywhere else takes NFTs nearly so seriously, though. The closest contender to the US, Russia, at present has a third of the NFT users of its rival. The projections for 2027 broadly reflect a proportionate increase as the number of Russian NFT holders doubles from 0.3 million to 0.6 million.While people think of America as the land of supersized highways and Mcdonald’s meals, continental Europe far exceeds it in metrics for NFT and DeFi use, although this remains proportionate to the overall number of users in both regions, with Europe nearly doubling the States and projected to comfortably maintain the lead by 2027.In general, the figures are positive for all aspects of crypto. The report highlights expectations that tokens (both fungible and non-fungible) and dapps will remain a thriving part of the broader cryptocurrency and blockchain ecosystem in the post-regulation landscape.How Regulations Drive Russian Crypto Adoption
This brings us to one key area that affects countries’ attitudes towards crypto, and by extension, their adoption level, namely: regulation.So, understanding Russia’s lead on crypto should be simple when we examine the context. Singapore research firm TrippleA estimated about 17.3 million Russians owned crypto in early 2021. The figure represented 12% of the population at the time. It grew by 2 million the following year.The lofty numbers are hardly surprising in a country where 46% of its internet users pay for goods and services using e-money, $16.8 billion of which is on-chain, according to 2022 figures.However, Russia’s crypto fans have hard a nervy ride. The Kremlin wasn’t always so accommodating. In January 2022, the Russian central bank published a public and industry consultation paper calling for tight oversight on crypto and an outright ban on a lot of crypto-related activities in the territory, including mining. This changed with the invasion of Ukraine.Now, Russia is taking a flexible approach. This week, government ministers have been discussing a new draft bill submitted by miners that aims to recognise the activity as a form of entrepreneurship. The bill has support from a swathe of lawmakers but lacks a final seal of approval from the Ministry of Industry and Trade.But on the whole, the Russian government has been reserved about cryptocurrencies. While cryptocurrencies present a potential avenue to help Russian citizens to evade US sanctions, the authorities have been focusing their energy instead on the digital ruble.How Regulations Drive Crypto Adoption in US
The regulation narrative will also continue to drive adoption in the US, albeit for different political and geopolitical reasons.The number one driver of adoption in the USA currently is the spot Bitcoin ETF narrative. ETFs are investment vehicles from funds that buy and hold Bitcoin to create and sell shares for their funds on exchanges.The industry was looking to US approval of spot Bitcoin ETFs to be the number one driver of institutional and family office adoption of crypto, because they provide a regulated means for anyone with a brokerage account to buy and hold Bitcoin to exploit its potential gains.Many regions legalised ETFs in recent years, including Canada and Europe. However, the prospect of a US ETF looked distant because the regulator responsible for approving one, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), has pursued an openly anti-crypto agenda since Chairman Gary Gensler took office in 2021 and started a crackdown by suing multiple actors in the industry, aka regulation-by-enforcement.Last year, things changed. A federal court overturned a ruling by the SEC that denied crypto-friendly asset manager Grayscale’s application to convert its Bitcoin trust into an ETF. The Judge ruled the SEC’s rejection “arbitrary and capricious”.Fast forward to 2024 and the SEC conceded 11 spot Bitcoin ETFs to the industry. They have been some of the most successful ETF launches in history, netting to date over $11.7 billion in inflows.Elsewhere in Washington, fierce debates have ignited around a proposed bill by anti-crypto lawmakers that the industry says puts far too stringent reporting requirements on crypto.In general, the US may be far behind the EU and Canada in terms of regulatory clarity, but crypto’s Stateside believers are likely to hold their dominating grasp on the world market in the short term.

Bitcoin or MicroStrategy Stock? Analyst Says MSTR Trades at ‘Unjustifiable Premium’ Over BTC - Decrypt

MicroStrategy stock is on a roll, hitting new highs as the price of Bitcoin surges. The “Bitcoin development company” stock (MSTR: NASDAQ) is now priced at $1,746 per share—a year-to-date rise of 615%. The price has now gotten “carried away,” however, and is due for a dip in price, investment management firm Kerrisdale Capital said in a new report. Titled “Know When to HODL, Know When to FODL,” the firm said the price of MSTR compared to Bitcoin is no longer justified. “We are long Bitcoin and short shares of MicroStrategy, a proxy for Bitcoin, which trades at an unjustifiable premium to the digital asset that drives its value,” the report read. “The days when MicroStrategy shares represented a rare, unique way to gain access to Bitcoin are long over.”The software firm started aggressively buying Bitcoin back in 2020. It’s now the largest corporate holder of the cryptocurrency, with 214,246 coins—today worth over $15 billion. Its co-founder and chairman Michael Saylor has repeatedly said that buying MSTR stock gives investors exposure to Bitcoin in a safe and reliable way compared to owning the digital coins directly or investing in newly approved ETFs (exchange-traded funds).He argues that MSTR is a good deal because of its lack of management fees. Kerrisdale’s report argued that this pitch isn’t fair.The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission approved a number of spot Bitcoin ETFs in January—giving traditional investors the ability to buy shares tracking the price of the cryptocurrency that trade on a regulated stock exchange. And the products have been massively successful—with record inflows to the funds—and some have very low fees. “Bitcoin is now easily obtainable through brokerages, crypto exchanges, and, more recently, low-fee ETPs and ETFs,” it observed.It added that buying Bitcoin was a better bet. “Shareholder value creation has been overwhelmingly driven by simple Bitcoin price appreciation—much as it would from owning Bitcoin outright,” it said. The price of Bitcoin is up nearly 3% toda, trading for $70,784 per coin, according to CoinGecko. It earlier this month hit a new all-time high of nearly $74,000. MSTR is meanwhile down nearly 10% today.Edited by Ryan Ozawa.Stay on top of crypto news, get daily updates in your inbox.

                        ETFGI, an independent research firm, reports assets invested in cryptocurrency exchange traded funds (ETFs) and exchange traded products (ETPs) listed globally have reached a major new milestone of $69.39 billion at the end of February seeing a 358.9% from $15.12 billion at end of 2023. Crypto ETFs and ETPs listed globally have gathered net inflows of $9.20 billion during the month of February, bringing year-to-date net inflows to $36.76 billion, which is much higher than $179.02 million in net inflows at this point last year.According to research firm ETFGI which was launched in 2012 by Deborah Fuhr who previously served as a managing director at BlackRock, this is the fifth month crypto ETFs and ETPs have seen net inflows.SEC Approves Spot Bitcoin ETFs January
On January 11, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission approved eleven spot Bitcoin ETF applications, from BlackRock, Ark Investments and 21Shares, Fidelity, Invesco and VanEck — this in turn has caused a trading frenzy and triggered a bull market.  Bitcoin BlackRock’s IBIT Sees $320M in Inflows
The BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) continues to gain traction in the cryptocurrency market, with recent data revealing a significant influx of $320 million in new investments.  This surge in inflows comes as BlackRock CEO Larry Fink has praised IBIT as the “fastest-growing ETF in the history of ETFs.”In a recent interview with Fox Business, Fink expressed his surprise and satisfaction with IBIT’s performance. Fink emphasized that the trust’s success has surpassed his expectations, particularly during its first 11 weeks of trading.Rise in Number of Issuers Launching Crypto ETFs and ETPs
In 2022, ETFGI reported assets of $12.4 billion were invested in 100 crypto ETFs or ETPs listed globally at the end of January, as previously reported. There has been a huge increase in the number of issuers launching cryptocurrency ETPs as more investors are doing due diligence on investing in cryptocurrency and some are starting to add some Bitcoin and other crypto exposures to their portfolios.

Ethereum Being Designated a Security Won’t Hurt Chances of Spot ETH ETFs Approval, Says BlackRock CEO Larry Fink - The Daily Hodl


								BlackRock chief executive Larry Fink believes approval of spot Ethereum (ETH) exchange-traded funds (ETFs) could still occur even if the top altcoin is deemed a security.
In a new interview on FOX Business, Fink says that the chances of approval for pending applications to launch spot ETH ETFs would not be adversely impacted if the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) designates Ethereum as a security.










“I don’t think that [security] designation is going to be that deleterious.” 
BlackRock is among several companies with pending applications before the SEC to launch a spot ETH ETF following the successful launch of spot Bitcoin (BTC) ETFs in January.
The SEC considers Bitcoin a commodity, not a security. Gary Gensler, SEC chair, has not said whether he believes ETH is a security, but he has suggested many digital assets besides Bitcoin could be deemed securities.
The SEC is reportedly moving to designate ETH as a security. Meanwhile, the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) has indicated ETH is a commodity.
Asked if BlackRock could still launch a spot ETH ETF even if Ethereum is deemed a security, Fink says they could.
He also says that the demand for BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) spot BTC ETF product is exceeding his expectations.
“I’m very bullish on the long-term viability of Bitcoin. We’re creating now a market that has more liquidity, more transparency. And I’m pleasantly surprised, and I would never have predicted it before we filed it, that we were going to see this type of retail demand… 
IBIT is the fastest-growing ETF in the history of ETFs. Nothing has gained assets as fast as IBIT in the history of ETFs.”

El Salvador’s Bitcoin Vault Hits ATH on Piggy Bank Rebalance - DailyCoin


        
El Salvador’s ‘Digital Gold’ vault has surpassed $400 million in market value.



Earlier this month, Mr. Bukele posted the public address of El Salvador’s BTC.



Two weeks after Bitcoin hit a new all-time high, El Salvador continues to DCA.
El Salvador’s recently re-elected President, Nayib Bukele, is making good on the Latin American country’s promise to acquire one Bitcoin (BTC) a day. In a message on X, Bukele revealed that the country’s stash has reached 5,700.A few weeks ago, El Salvador shocked the cryptosphere by presenting a physical vault with a built-in hardware wallet to store the country’s BTC reserves. In addition, the lump sum in the cryptocurrency address that’s publicly available for tracking indicated a far larger amount than previously expected.El Salvador’s Bitcoin Stash RevealedEarlier this month, El Salvador’s estimated BTC stash was said to have nurtured a $85 million profit, according to data from NayibTracker. On March 15, 2024, Bukele revealed there was a physical BTC vault inside El Salvador. This location is unknown to the public, but the vault’s crypto address has been publicized on X, as Bukele showcased a 5,689 balance in a cryptic tweet, inspiring crypto aficionados to contribute with numerous digital relicts being sent there.El Salvador’s Bitcoin address shows 11 BTC added in the past 11 days by Bitfinex, the official partner of El Salvador in their Bitcoin program. This totals El Salvador’s holdings to 5,702 Bitcoins at the time of this publication, worth $402 883 744.How El Salvador Benefits From Pioneering BitcoinEl Salvador pledged to buy one Bitcoin a day, based on the Dollar Cost Average (DCA) strategy. Bukele even declared that the country will keep topping up on its BTC stash until it becomes “unaffordable with fiat currencies.”Popular YouTuber Wealthy Expat named the available citizenship for a $1 million investment via BTC as one of the strong points for El Salvador to become a leading cryptocurrency hub in the next decade.
Finally, the erased tax on all IT startups and the recently implemented 0% tax for foreign-sourced income play a key part in this prediction, as El Salvador’s Bitcoin Office continues to recruit visitors and investors through the Freedom Visa Program.On the Flipside
Many of El Salvador’s foreign investors, including Wall Street, are awaiting the highly-anticipated issuance of El Salvador’s Volcano bonds.



These Bitcoin-backed Volcano bonds were due for an early 2024 release but were postponed numerous times until further notice.
Why This MattersEl Salvador declared Bitcoin a legal tender in 2021, paving the way for other countries to embrace blockchain technology and adapt it for everyday use.

Vitalik Buterin pushes for anti-correlation incentives in Ethereum staking - Crypto Briefing




Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin has proposed a new framework to incentivize Ethereum decentralization by penalizing correlated failures among validators.According to the research proposal submitted by Buterin, large-scale staking groups, and organizations have an undue advantage over smaller players, creating an imbalance in the decentralized staking sector.“The theory is that if you are a single large actor, any mistakes that you make would be more likely to be replicated across all “identities” that you control, even if you split your coins up among many nominally-separate accounts,” the Ethereum co-founder said.Buterin suggests that validators controlled by the same entity should receive a higher penalty if they fail together, compared to failing independently. The theory behind this approach is that mistakes made by a single large actor are more likely to be replicated across all the “identities” they control.Staking pools and liquid staking services such as Lido remain popular among users, given how their platform allows for the participation of more stakers due to the lower amount of entry (in ETH). To date, Lido currently has an estimated $34 billion worth of ETH staked, representing around 30% of the total supply. Advocates and developers pushing for Ethereum decentralization have previously cautioned against Lido’s dominance and the potential for “cartelization,” where outsized profits can be extracted compared to non-pooled capital.Buterin’s analysis of recent attestation data revealed that validators within the same cluster, such as a staking pool, are more likely to experience correlated failures, likely due to shared infrastructure. To address this issue, he proposed penalizing validators proportionally to the deviation from the average failure rate. If many validators fail in a given slot, the penalty for each failure would be higher.Based on simulations of this scenario, such a system could reduce the advantage of large Ethereum stakers over smaller ones, as large entities are more likely to cause spikes in the failure rate due to correlated failures.The proposal’s potential benefits include incentivizing Ethereum decentralization by encouraging separate infrastructure for each validator and making solo staking more economically competitive relative to staking pools. Buterin notes that other options could be subjected to further analysis. This includes variations on the penalty schemes in order to minimize the average “big” validator’s advantage over smaller validators.According to Buterin, it’s also worth examining the impact of such a framework in terms of geographic and client decentralization. However, he did not mention the possibility of reducing the solo staking amount from the current 32 Ether (ETH) or approximately $111,000 based on Ether’s current price at roughly $3,500.

Glassnode Data Shows Bitcoin at Crossroads: Time to Hold or Take Profit?


								According to on-chain data analysis by Glassnode, Bitcoin is at a critical juncture. When BTC soared to $73,800 in March 2024, printing new all-time highs, the Bitcoin market reached a statistically significant level regarding on-chain unrealized profits, according to the Market Value to Realized Value (MVRV) ratio.
Bitcoin MVRV Ratio At Historically Significant Level: Time To Hold Or Take Profit?
The analytics platform notes that, historically, such levels have coincided with periods of market resistance. Therein, some holders often choose to take profits by exiting their positions. 

It remains to be seen whether the same will be replicated, and prices fall as holders make a profit. However, according to MVRV, this will likely happen if past performance guides.
BTC MVRV Bands | Source: Glassnode on X
Simply put, the MVRV ratio shows how expensive the coin is relative to historical prices. It is a tool for gauging whether Bitcoin, as it is at spot rates, is under or overvalued. When the ratio is above 1, it suggests that it is overvalued.
When BTC rose to approximately $74,000, the MVRV ratio rose above 3. However, it should be noted that it was way lower than historical levels when Bitcoin registered new all-time highs. When BTC rose to $69,000 in 2021, the MVRV ratio was over 5. At the 2017 peak, this value was over 4.8, which is the highest it has been.
BTC Has Been Under Pressure, Will Prices Recover?
Recently, Bitcoin has struggled to edge higher, looking at price action in the daily chart. The coin remains below all-time highs of $73,800. Even though bulls shook off selling pressure over the weekend, pushing strongly above resistance levels, the follow-through has not been impressive.

Any breakout above $74,000 from the candlestick arrangement will thrust the coin into new territory. Some analysts speculate the coin might float to as high as $100,000 in 2024, especially after the network halves its miner rewards in April 2024.

Despite the recent sell-off pushing prices to around $62,000, the overall market sentiment remains bullish. The CoinStats Fear and Greed Index, a gauge of investor sentiment, still reads “Extreme Greed” at 80.

Additionally, interest is back after days of outflows from spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs). By March 27, Lookonchain data shows that Fidelity added added 4,001 BTC. In total, and factoring in GBTC’s outflow, all spot Bitcoin ETF issuers added 3,469 BTC.

AGIX Token Surges on AltSignals Merger News, Hits $1.39


							

AGIX’s price hits a 7-day high at $1.39, up 28% over the month amid merger news.



AGIX volume surges by 97.27%, and the market cap reaches $1.78 billion.



Bollinger bands widen on the AGIX chart, signaling increased volatility.




Since the news of a merger of SingularityNET (AGIX), Fetch.ai (FET), and Ocean Protocol (OCEAN) into AltSignals (ASI) Token, which would have a diluted valuation of $7.5 billion, AGIX has been on a positive surge. As a result, the AGIX bullish momentum regained strength, sending the price to a 7-day high of $1.39 after finding support at an intra-day low of $1.20. At press time, AGIX was trading at $1.39, up 7.98% in the prior 24 hours and 28% in the previous month.



If the positive momentum breaks over the $1.39 resistance, the next resistance levels to watch for are $1.50 and $1.60, as investors continue to believe in the potential of AltSignals (ASI) Token. However, if the price fails to break over $1.39, there may be a brief pullback down to the $1.20 support level before trying another positive rise.

During the rise, AGIX’s market capitalization and 24-hour trading volume increased by 7.595% and 97.27%, respectively, to $1,775,791,076 and $544,730,216. This jump reflects increased interest and investment in the AGIX token, with the potential for more gains if the bullish trend continues.



AGIX/USD Technical Analysis



On the AGIXUSD 4-hour price chart, the Bollinger bands are widening, with the upper and lower bands touching $1.3686 and $1.07931, respectively.  This trend points to heightened volatility in the near future, with the upper and lower bands possibly serving as resistance and support levels for price moves.



However, as the bullishly engulfed candlestick has breached the upper Bollinger band, the upward trend may continue in the short term. Conversely, this might suggest an overbought position, which could result in a price downturn.



AGIX/USD 4-hour price chart (source: TradingView)



The Money Flow Index (MFI) rating of 78 lends validity to the overbought circumstances, indicating that the asset’s present upward momentum may be reaching its limit. As a result, traders should take care and constantly monitor market movement for indications of a reversal or correction. However, with the stochastic RSI moving above its signal line at 42.89, there is still room for more upward movement before a correction happens.



Furthermore, the Chaikin Money Flow (CMF), which is now in the negative area with a rating of -0.06, is rising, indicating that selling pressure may be diminishing and purchasers may soon reclaim control of the asset’s price movement. This suggests that, while prudence is advised, there is potential for more positive momentum soon.

United States Treasury’s tokenized assets hit over $1 billion

The tokenization of United States Treasurys and other real-world assets on blockchain platforms has gained significant traction, with over $1 billion worth of U.S. Treasurys now existing across Ethereum, Polygon, Solana, and other blockchains. This surge has been fueled in part by the launch of the BlackRock USD Institutional Digital Liquidity Fund (BUIDL), which has quickly become a prominent player in the market.United States tokenized treasury asset hits a milestone figureBUIDL, launched on Ethereum on March 20, has rapidly grown to a market cap of $244.8 million. Recent transactions totaling $95 million have further boosted the fund, making it the second largest tokenized government securities fund, trailing only Franklin Templeton’s Franklin OnChain U.S. Government Money Fund (FOBXX), which holds $360.2 million in United States Treasurys.The appeal of tokenized government treasures lies in their 1:1 peg with the United States dollar and the daily accrued dividends they pay directly to investors each month. This model, facilitated via the Securitize protocol, is seen as more attractive from both a risk and return perspective compared to stablecoin yields, particularly in the current high-interest rate environment.Real-world asset tokenization firms like Ondo Finance have also contributed significantly to BUIDL’s growth. Ondo Finance recently deposited $79.3 million into BlackRock’s fund, totaling $95 million across four transactions. This move allows instant settlements for Ondo Finance’s own U.S. Treasury-backed token, OUSG, and has earned the firm a 38% share in BUIDL.Growing trends and the impact of tokenized assetsThe broader landscape of tokenized assets includes not just U.S. Treasurys but also stocks, real estate, and various other assets that can be tokenized on blockchain platforms. Ethereum, for instance, accounts for $700 million of all real-world assets (RWA) tokenized on-chain, highlighting the platform’s significance in this space.BlackRock CEO Larry Fink’s support for blockchain tokenization reflects a broader trend in the financial industry, with Boston Consulting Group estimating that the tokenization market could reach $16 trillion by 2030. This trend is not limited to traditional asset management firms like BlackRock and Franklin Templeton.Blockchain-native firms such as Ondo Finance, Backed Finance, Matrixdock, Maple Finance, and Swarm are also active participants in tokenizing real-world assets. Overall, the rapid growth of tokenized U.S. Treasurys and other assets on blockchain platforms underscores the increasing acceptance and adoption of blockchain technology in the financial sector, paving the way for more efficient and accessible capital markets in the future.

Sanctioned crypto exchange Garantex probed over $20B USDT transfers


A dual probe by US and UK investigators is investigating the movement of 20 billion tether (USDT) through crypto exchange Garantex after both countries instituted sanctions against the exchange.
According to Bloomberg sources, the transactions involved in the probe may constitute one of the biggest breaches of wartime sanctions since Russia began its invasion of Ukraine.
The investigation into the possible violation of wartime sanctions doesn’t necessarily indicate wrongdoing by Tether Holdings or its affiliated companies. A Tether Holdings spokesperson reiterated that the firm remains committed to working with law enforcement to catch and prevent criminal misconduct.
According to an Estonian newspaper, Garantex has ties to a convicted gang member, a violent debt collection agency, and a state-backed oil company in Russia. With support from the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists (ICIJ), that newspaper published details of the misbehavior of people connected to Garantex.

According to the US Treasury, Garantex has willfully disregarded anti-money laundering (AML) and countering the financing of terrorism (CFT) obligations and has allowed its systems to be abused by illicit actors. Crypto wallets controlled by Garantex are listed on the Office of Foreign Assets Control’s Specially Designated Nationals List.
In December 2023, Russian bank InDeFi Bank launched a tether trading project in collaboration with Russian company Exved. An executive at that bank is the founder of Garantex.

Bitcoin Ordinals Creator Unveils 'Rune' Documentation, Here's What You Need To Know



Runes’ functionality is based on the concept of runestones, which are protocol messages saved in Bitcoin transaction outputs.

Casey Rodarmor, creator of the Bitcoin Ordinals protocol has unveiled Runes documentation, indicating a new phase for BTC transactions.
The Characteristics of Bitcoin Runes
The documentation describes the basic characteristics of Runes, such as their names, amount, Cap, minting, burning, and divisibility.




Runes introduces an innovative concept to Bitcoin transactions that permits the etching, minting, and transfer of Bitcoin-native digital commodities on the blockchain. Notably, Runes come into existence through etching. Etching generates a Rune and assigns its properties. Once set, these properties are immutable, even by the etcher.
Every unit of Rune is the same, unlike unique Inscriptions. This feature makes Rune an interchangeable token fit for use in a variety of crypto applications. Runes are identifiable by IDs, which are textually written as BLOCK:TX and comprise the block in which the Bitcoin Rune was etched as well as the index of the etching transaction within that block.
Runes’ functionality is based on the concept of runestones, which are protocol messages saved in Bitcoin transaction outputs. Runestones facilitate smooth transactions within the Bitcoin network by encoding crucial information about Rune production, minting, and transfer.
Another key feature introduced by Runes is the concept of minting, which involves the generation of new units. Mints can be open or closed, with certain rules governing their operations. This approach allows for the controlled issuing of Runes, maintaining transparency and fairness throughout the ecosystem.
As indicated in the documentation, names, represented by letters A through Z, are assigned during the etching process, with spacers included for reading. However, the uniqueness of a name is not determined by spacers. Therefore, a Rune may not be carved with the same letter sequence as an existing version, even if the spacers are different.
Furthermore, the documentation also describes the Rune burning and transfer procedure, which involves exchanging the assets between transaction inputs and outputs. While burnt Runes are removed permanently from circulation, transfers are facilitated through runestone edicts.
The Growing Prominence of Bitcoin Ordinals
Bitcoin Ordinals can be described as Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs) on the Bitcoin blockchain that use satoshis, the chain’s smallest denomination to encode their data. Every satoshi is assigned a serial number based on the sequence it was mined. These numbers are known as ordinals, and they assist the blockchain to keep track of where each satoshi is and who owns them.
The demand for Bitcoin Ordinals has increased drastically over the past year. Due to this demand, it has grown to become a major contributor to the Bitcoin blockchain’s gas fees. In May, the total number of ordinal inscriptions on the Bitcoin blockchain surpassed 10 million.
Consequently, reputable firms including MicroStrategy Inc (NASDAQ: MSTR) have stated intentions to incorporate Bitcoin Ordinals into their platform. Michael Saylor, the co-founder of MicroStrategy, revealed at the time that he was interested in assessing the application development potential of Bitcoin Ordinals.
In a similar move, Donald Trump recently launched an NFT on the Bitcoin network, valued at $9,900.

                        Investment manager Kerrisdale Capital said on March 28 that shares of MicroStrategy (MSTR) – the world’s largest corporate Bitcoin holder – are currently trading at an “unjustifiable” premium to MicroStrategy’s actual Bitcoin holdings.MSTR shares have exploded in price over the past two months, but many analysts think the stock is due for a major pullback.The MicroStrategy Bitcoin Premium
“We are long bitcoin and short shares of MicroStrategy… Shares of MicroStrategy have soared amid a recent rise in the price of bitcoin but, as is often the case with crypto, things have gotten carried away,” the firm wrote.At the time the report was published, MSTR’s price was over $1900 per share. Based on the company’s BTC holdings per share, Kerrisdale said this would imply a current Bitcoin price of $177,000 per coin – a spot price two and a half times higher than where it trades today.Since MicroStrategy’s balance sheet is almost entirely comprised of Bitcoin (BTC), investors have often valued the firm like it were a Bitcoin spot ETF. The company’s executive chairman, Michael Saylor, has called the firm a Bitcoin ETF with perks including moderate leverage and no management fees.Starting in January, the company faced an influx of competition from several asset managers that launched the United States’ first actual Bitcoin spot ETFs. BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust, IBIT, has already accumulated more Bitcoin than MicroStrategy.“The days when MicroStrategy shares represented a rare, unique way to gain access to Bitcoin are long over,” wrote Kerrisdale.Any advantages the firm has over regular ETFs – such as diluting shares to acquire more BTC – are outweighed by the sheer size of the premium.“Assuming the current premium of 2.6x contracts to a more historically consistent 1.3x represents 50% downside in MSTR relative to bitcoin,” the firm said.MSTR Price Tanks
Shortly after Kerrisdale’s report was published, MSTR shares plummeted by 8% on the day to $1,761. Meanwhile, Bitcoin trades 1.7% higher at $70,600, and Bitcoin mining firm Marathon Digital trades 4% higher at $24.04.MSTR continues to vastly outperform BTC year-to-date, with both assets boasting gains of 158% and 66% respectively.According to saylortracker.com, MicroStrategy Bitcoin holdings are currently worth over $15 billion, having more than doubled in value from their average purchase price.

Crypto Community Reacts To Sam Bankman-Fried's 25-Year Sentence: 'Will His Parents Ever Be Implicated?' - Benzinga

The Sam Bankman-Fried, former CEO of cryptocurrency exchange FTX, was sentenced to 25 years in prison on Thursday, prompting a host of reactions from the cryptocurrency community on X (formerly Twitter).What Happened: Many users, like NickyD, expressed outrage at the perceived leniency of the sentence. Comparisons were drawn to Ross Ulbricht, the founder of Silk Road, who is serving multiple life sentences for facilitating illegal online transactions. NickyD tweeted, “Guess the scales of justice tip nicely for the well-connected,” highlighting a sentiment of unequal punishment. NewsWars.AI took a more partisan approach, labeling Bankman-Fried a “Democrat Donor” convicted of a “massive financial fraud.”CrusaderPepe offered a stark perspective, highlighting the sheer amount of money stolen by Bankman-Fried: “This is equivalent to the lifetime earnings of 4,000 people,” they commented.Matthew Sabia took a more lighthearted, albeit insensitive, approach, referencing the potential impact on Democratic Party finances with a tweet suggesting donations have been “crippled by inflation.”Several users questioned Bankman-Fried’s ability to survive a 25-year sentence. Dgen’s tweet, “Not sure he’s going to make it…” reflects a degree of disbelief about the length of the sentence. JC60176 took aim at politicians who received campaign contributions from Bankman-Fried, asking, “Those Dem politicians who took campaign donations…are strangely silent…”Carol Roth raised a critical question: “Sam Bankman Fried gets 25 years– next q–will his parents ever be implicated?” Also Read: Bitcoin ETFs Inflows Soar, Ethereum ETF Race Heats Up: What Does it Mean For Investors?This points to a desire for a wider investigation into the FTX collapse and potential involvement of others.Angela, perhaps reflecting the broader sentiment, believed the sentence wasn’t harsh enough, tweeting, “He deserves more than 100 years for crazy behaviour!” The Bankman-Fried saga serves as a stark reminder of the risks associated with cryptocurrency and the need for robust regulations.What’s Next: As the dust settles on the Bankman-Fried case, the cryptocurrency industry grapples with its future. Benzinga’s Future of Digital Assets event, taking place on Nov. 19, promises to be a crucial platform to discuss these issues and explore the path towards responsible innovation within the crypto space.Read Next: Sam Bankman-Fried Sentencing Update: Defense Says He’s Not A ‘Ruthless Financial Serial Killer’Image: Shutterstock

Crypto users react to Sam Bankman-Fried’s 25-year sentence

More than 500 days after the collapse of cryptocurrency exchange FTX, users have an answer for the number of years former CEO Sam “SBF” Bankman-Fried will face in prison: 25.In a March 28 hearing, Judge Lewis Kaplan sentenced the former FTX CEO to 300 months in prison for his conviction related to misusing customer funds. Prosecutors had suggested up to 50 years in prison for SBF, while his defense attorneys requested the judge be lenient and only impose up to 6.5 years. The judge added the former CEO had committed perjury and intimidated witnesses.Immediately following the announcement in the New York courtroom, crypto users jumped onto social media to express their thoughts. Many suggested that 25 years wasn’t enough time given longer sentences handed down for seemingly less serious crimes.“[The judge] gave him less than Chelsea Manning (35 years) for a waaaaay worse crime,” said Edward Snowden on X, referring to Manning’s 2013 conviction for violations of the Espionage Act.Source: MandrikThough the sentencing guidelines allowed Judge Kaplan to put SBF in prison for more than 100 years, many pointed out before the hearing that this outcome was unlikely. Several legal experts speculated Bankman-Fried would serve between 10 and 30 years, and others suggested it may be an effective deterrent for figures in the crypto space.“Judge Kaplan weighed all of the sentencing factors, including the magnitude of the crime, his conclusion that SBF lied on the witness stand and tampered with a witness, and handed down a serious sentence,” Mark Bini, a former Assistant U.S. Attorney in the Eastern District of New York, told Cointelegraph. “While less than the prosecutors’ request for 40-50 years, it is a very significant sentence and sends a message that people convicted of crimes in the crypto space will face serious consequences.”Source: U.S. Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New YorkSwan Bitcoin Managing Director Terrence Yang largely disagreed, telling Cointelegraph “justice is not served” and 25 years was “too light” based on the number of suicides in the wake of the collapse of FTX, SBF’s perjury, and the misuse of user funds.“The damage SBF did was permanent and severe,” said Yang. “He ruined a lot of families and lives with his felonious acts and put salt in the deep wounds with his total lack of remorse. I get that he has ADHD and ADHD families filed a statement with the court asking for leniency but SBF is the only person with ADHD in the world who stole billions of dollars in customer funds and destroyed or hurt millions of lives.”Related: What to expect at Sam Bankman-Fried’s sentencing hearingBankman-Fried was taken out of court on March 28 to the Metropolitan Detention Center in Brooklyn, where he has been since Judge Kaplan revoked his bail in August 2023. Ryan Salame, the former co-CEO of FTX Digital Markets, will likely be the next figure in the case to face sentencing on May 1. Gary Wang, Caroline Ellison and Nishad Singh — other former executives associated with FTX and Alameda Research — have already pleaded guilty and accepted deals.Magazine: ‘Less flashy’ Mashinsky set for less jail time than SBF: Inner City Press, X Hall of FlameUpdate (March 28 at 6:20 pm UTC): This article has been updated to include a statement from the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Southern District of New York.

Why BlackRock Could Bet On This RWA Token: Crypto Analyst


                            In an era where the boundaries between traditional finance (TradFi) and crypto continue to blur, the tokenization of real-world assets (RWAs) stands out as one of the hottest trends. This trend, which allows tangible assets like vehicles and real estate to be bought and sold as tokens on a blockchain, promises to revolutionize the efficiency and speed of asset transactions.
Just last week, BlackRock, the world’s largest asset manager, has positioned itself at the forefront of this movement with the launch of a $100 million tokenization fund, which has already attracted over $240 million in investment within its first week.
Larry Fink, CEO of BlackRock, has been vocal about the potential of tokenization, stating that RWAs “could revolutionize, again, finance.” This comment has contributed to a notable surge in the valuation of several RWA crypto tokens in recent weeks. In light of these developments, crypto analysts from Layergg have identified a specific crypto project that they believe could garner significant interest from BlackRock.
Why BlackRock Could Choose Aptos
The project in question is Aptos, which has been earmarked for its potential in the RWA space. According to Layergg’s analysis shared on X (formerly Twitter), the narrative surrounding RWA and tokenization, bolstered by BlackRock’s involvement, suggests a nascent yet rapidly growing interest in this sector.
They highlight that mid to low cap RWA projects listed on Binance have performed exceptionally well, indicating a broader market interest spurred by narrative-driven investment strategies. However, the favorite crypto project for BlackRock could be Aptos.

A closer look at Aptos reveals several factors that might make it an attractive partner for BlackRock. Firstly, Aptos is poised to make a significant announcement related to RWA in April, coinciding with the Aptos DeFi DAYS event from April 2 to 5.

This announcement is speculated to involve a partnership with a global asset management firm, potentially BlackRock. “A partnership with a global asset management firm is expected to be announced. It is speculated that this may include BlackRock,” the analysts remarked.
The basis for this speculation includes Aptos CEO Mo Shaikh’s previous tenure at BlackRock, suggesting pre-existing industry connections that could facilitate such a partnership.

Moreover, Aptos founder Mo Shaikh & head of ecosystem at Aptos Labs Neil H hinted at this early on. In mid-February Shaikh revealed via X: “I sat down with three of the world’s largest asset managers this week A little preview…while the year started with ETFs, it will conclude with RWA on-chain en masse, growth in Asia and all using parallelisation on Aptos See you in Hong Kong.”

On February 21, Shaikh also commented on a post on X by Dan Morehead, founder and managing partner at Pantera Capital. Morehead stated, “Tomorrow I’ll be speaking at BlackRock’s Institutional Digital Assets Summit. […] The existence of that Summit **IS** the massive change. Really excited about this.” Mo Shaikh mysteriously commented, “There’s Summit to this.”
Clues from the Aptos founder | Source: X @layerggofficial
Besides that, Adam Cader, founder of Thala Labs recently stated via X that “something is cooking for Aptos. I’m a co-founder of the largest application on the network, and here’s my list of upcoming significant ecosystem wide catalysts.” Cader referenced Shaikh’s statement and added that Blackrock, Vanguard, and Fidelity are the three largest asset managers in the world.
“If I had to guess this refers to either them using the chain in some way / integrating it into one of their products which has precedent in the TradFi world. Also note Blackrock is the most crypto-aligned of the bunch,” he said via X.
Crypto Revolution: Will APT Follow AVAX?
But that’s not all. Aptos has been hinted to explore partnerships with other major asset management firms, including Franklin Templeton, which has previously invested in Aptos (tier 3) and planned to utilize its blockchain for money market funds.
Such strategic alliances could position Aptos similarly to how Avalanche benefited from its partnerships in the Project Guardian initiative (JPMorgan and Wisdomtree), experiencing a substantial price increase post-announcement. “Avalanche saw a price increase of more than 4x following the ‘Project Guardian’ news,” Layergg noted.
They concluded, “If a partnership with BlackRock proceeds, more ‘Big partnerships’ will naturally follow.”
At press time, APT traded at $17.59, up 87% over the past five weeks.

Top 3 Meme Coins That Can Give A 1,000% Return In The Bull Market | Bitcoinist.com


								The rave around meme coins and their popularity has proven that they will be a driving force in the upcoming bull market. As such, it is important for investors looking to make money in the market to position in good meme coins before the bull run commences. So, here are the top 3 coins that have the potential for a 1,000% return in the bull market.
Myro (MYRO) Leads Undervalued Meme Coins
The Myro (MYRO) meme coin has been around for a number of months now and has yet to fade from the limelight. It comes as a second chance for investors who missed the run with DogWifHat (WIF), and has followed a similar pattern to WIF as well.

Just like WIF, Myro has been initially listed by Binance on its futures platform but not on its spot platform. Again, similar to WIF, Myro’s price had surged to a new all-time high following this listing before dropping back down. If it continues to follow this trend, then the meme coin’s price could see a rapid surge to $1 billion on its next leg up.
Myro is currently in the cycle that WIF was about a month ago before it rallied. From here, a rally to a $2.5 billion market cap would mean a 1,000% increase for the meme coin, which is a feasible target for Myro.

ArbDoge AI (AIDOGE)
ArbDoge AI (AIDOGE) is one of the leading meme coins on the Arbitrum network, but what sets it apart is the fact that it has lasted this long in the market. Currently, ArbDoge AI (AIDOGE) seems suppressed by the lack of action on the Arbitrum network. However, once adoption picks up on the network, it is expected to spill over to AIDOGE similar to what happened to Solana-based BONK.
AIDOGE is trading at less than half the market of Myro at $100 million, which gives it a lot of room to run. So far, AIDOGE is the only coin that has shown potential to be the first meme coin to cross the $1 billion market cap milestone on the Arbitrum network.
Bone ShibaSwap (BONE) Can Reach $2 Billion
Another meme coin that has the capacity for a 1,000% return is Bone ShibaSwap (BONE), which is part of the Shiba Inu ecosystem. One thing that sets the BONE coin apart from other meme coins is the fact that it is also a utility token.

The Ethereum Layer 2 network, Shibarium, developed by the Shiba Inu team, uses the BONE token as its fee token. This means that demand is created for BONE every time the Shibarium network is used as users need BONE to pay gas fees.
As the adoption of the Shibarium network continues to rise, so will the demand for the BONE token. This sort of demand is the driver for coins like Solana (SOL) and Avalanche (AVAX), and at only a $209 million market cap, BONE still has a long way to go, given its utility.

BNB's 10% price surge - Is it still on track for its April predictions? - AMBCrypto



BNB’s price movement and Chaikin Money Flow have created a bearish divergence.
Other key technical indicators have hinted at the possibility of a price decline.

The past week’s surge in the price of Binance Coin [BNB], coupled with the downtrend of its Chaikin Money Flow (CMF), has created a bearish divergence, suggesting a potential price reversal.
At press time, BNB traded at $586. According to CoinMarketCap, the altcoin’s value rallied by almost 10% in the last week. 
During the same period, its CMF indicator assessed on a 24-hour chart initiated a downtrend. This indicator measures money flow into and out of an asset over a specified period. 
A bearish divergence occurs when an asset’s price increases while its CMF craters. The discrepancy indicates that despite the price increase, buying pressure is weak. Weakened buying pressure is often followed by a downward correction once buyers in the market are unable to sustain any further price rally. 
Source: TradingView
Should BNB holders expect a pullback?
A look at some of BNB’s technical indicators on a daily chart revealed that it may shed some of last week’s gains in the short term.
According to readings from its Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) indicator, its MACD line crossed below its signal line on 19th March.
A downward intersection of the MACD line with the signal line is considered a bearish sign, suggesting that an asset’s shorter-term moving average is losing strength relative to its longer-term moving average. 
When traders spot this intersection, they take it as a confirmation that market sentiment has shifted from bullish to bearish and that the growth in selling pressure could potentially drive down an asset’s value. 
Although BNB’s price has grown by 10% since this intersection, this merely mirrors general market performance. Its price rally has not been backed by any significant demand.
Its Money Flow Index (MFI) indicator, which returned a value of 48.18 and trended downward at press time, showed that selling pressure outpaced buying activity amongst market participants.

No cause for alarm
While BNB may appear poised to lose some of its gains, volatility markers showed a low possibility of significant price swings in either direction. 
The gap between the upper and lower bands of the coin’s Bollinger Bands (BB) indicator was considerably narrow. This means that price volatility is relatively low. Confirming this, the coin’s Bollinger BandWidth (BBW) trended downward at press time.

Ethereum validator count passes one million


The Ethereum network reached a milestone of one million validators Thursday, staking about 32 million Ether, worth an estimated US$114 billion. 
This number accounts for roughly 26% of Ethereum’s total supply.
The transition of the Ethereum blockchain to a proof-of-stake system in September 2022 has been instrumental in attracting this large number of validators, who are rewarded for their contributions to the network’s security. 
Lido, a leading staking pool, has emerged as a preferred platform, holding about 30% of all staked ETH and allowing individuals with smaller holdings to participate in staking. 



However, the growing validator count has sparked debate within the Ethereum community, with some expressing concerns over the possibility of over-staking and the potential rise in transaction failures.
In the regulatory area, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has reportedly been issuing subpoenas to entities associated with the Ethereum Foundation. 
According to Fortune, these legal actions are part of an investigation targeting the foundation’s dealings, with a focus on the non-profit organization headquartered in Switzerland. 
The Ethereum Foundation is known for its role in the development and governance of the Ethereum blockchain. 



Some firms reportedly received subpoenas shortly after Ethereum’s transition to proof-of-stake from the previous proof-of-work model. 
The regulatory body’s steps have sparked discussions around its potential implications for the classification of Ether as a security.
The regulatory authority has been postponing decisions on several applications for such Ether ETFs and is expected to make a decision on May 23.
According to BlackRock CEO Larry Fink, one of the Ether ETF applicants, such a financial product can be possible even if the digital asset is classified as a security.

Hacker Steals Over $65,200,000 From Crypto Game Built on Blast Blockchain - Then Returns Everything: On-Chain Data - The Daily Hodl


								A crypto game built on the layer-2 blockchain Blast lost over 60% of the total value of assets on its platform following a massive security breach.
Munchables announced the exploit on Tuesday in a post on the social media platform X.










“Munchables has been compromised. We are tracking movements and attempting to stop the transactions. We will update as soon as we know more.”
Pseudonymous on-chain researcher ZachXBT says the hacker’s wallet address held 17,400 Ethereum (ETH) worth $62.5 million, which represents a large portion of Munchables’ Total Value Locked (TVL).
“Had like $96 million TVL according to DefiLlama before dev drained $62 million.”
Source: ZachXBT/X
Citing on-chain data, ZachXBT says the North Korean developer that the Munchables team hired is likely behind the exploit.
“This is what happens when a North Korean dev is hired.
Four different devs hired by the Munchables team and linked to the exploiter are likely all the same person as they: 
>recommended each other for the job
 >regularly transferred payments to the same two exchange deposit addresses 
>funded each other’s wallets.”
Source: ZachXBT/X
The hacker fortunately decided to return the assets. Munchables says it now has access to the compromised funds.
“The Munchables developer has shared all private keys involved to assist in recovering the user funds. Specifically, the key which holds $62,535,441.24, the key which holds 73 WETH, and the owner key which contains the rest of the funds.
All user funds are safe, lockdrops will not be enforced, all Blast-related rewards will be distributed as well. Updates to follow in the coming days.”

Will Elon Musk's X Payments System Include Dogecoin and Other Cryptocurrencies? Here is the Latest Clear Information - Bitcoin Sistemi


There has been a new development regarding the payment company X Payments, which will be included in the social media platform formerly known as Twitter and whose name was changed to X after Elon Musk's acquisition.
According to the latest information, X Payments will most likely not support cryptocurrency payments at launch. The company has not yet applied for the necessary virtual currency licenses that would allow its products to include virtual assets.


Today, X Payments was granted a Check Sales and Money Transmitters license for Louisiana. However, Louisiana also requires a Virtual Currency Business License for products involving crypto assets, such as those offered by Robinhood, PayPal, Coinbase, and eToro. All of these companies have this operating license in addition to the Money Transmitter license.
It appears that X Payments has not applied for these operating licenses. If they had applied, this license would have been granted to them along with the Money Transmitter License granted today.






The situation is similar in New York state, which requires two different licenses for companies. The New York State Department of Financial Services confirmed in an email that X Payments has not yet applied for a virtual currency license.
Elon Musk has previously stated that New York and California are the most difficult states to obtain approval. It is hoped that X Payments has already applied for Money Transmitter Licenses for New York, but they may not have pursued the virtual license as they likely would not support it initially.

How ETH ETF Works with Security Label According to Larry Fink - DailyCoin


        
BlackRock CEO Larry Fink suggests that an ETH security label will not be a deal breaker for Ethereum ETFs.



This outcome would, however, require a seismic shift in the crypto industry.



According to one expert, this would be the ideal outcome for the SEC.
After over a decade of trying, the crypto industry finally saw spot Bitcoin ETFs over the line in January 2024. With this success, attention has shifted to getting the same green light for similar products backed by Ethereum.However, just like the former, getting Ethereum ETFs over the line does not look like a cakewalk amid whispers of reluctance from the SEC. Growing uncertainty has been further heightened by reports that the market regulator is probing the Ethereum Foundation to label the asset as a security.But as some fear this probe to be the final nail in the coffin for pending Ethereum ETF applications, a statement from BlackRock CEO Larry Fink has offered a different perspective. According to the BlackRock chief, an ETH security label would not stop ETFs. But how will that work?An Ethereum Security Label Not A Deal Breaker?On Wednesday, March 27, BlackRock’s Larry Fink spoke with Fox Business on various topics, including spot Ethereum ETFs. When Fox Business’ Charles Gasparino asked how a potential Ethereum security classification could affect pending ETF applications, Fink asserted that it would not be “deleterious.”When asked whether applicants like BlackRock could still get the green light if the SEC classified Ethereum as a security, the BlackRock chief added, “I think so.”Fink’s sentiments contradict the prevailing sentiment in crypto circles that an ETH security label could mark the end of Ethereum ETF discussions. As highlighted by the BlackRock chief, the SEC can and does approve ETFs backed by securities. However, these securities will have to meet the SEC’s regulatory requirements.
In this case, a body like the Ethereum Foundation, which oversees the blockchain’s development, will likely have to register with the SEC and file regular disclosures, all of which the crypto community maintains remains impractical for most blockchain projects.This hypothetical, therefore, hinges on the ability of the SEC to compel Ethereum to register as a security.The Ideal Outcome for the SEC?Commenting on Larry Fink’s statements, The ETF Institute co-founder Nate Geraci suggested that getting the security label on Ethereum before approving spot ETFs would be the ideal outcome for the agency.
“This actually makes some sense & could allow SEC to thread needle given they already approved eth futures ETFs… If SEC can pull off, they get what they want (eth = security) w/out facing Grayscale-esque lawsuit,” he wrote.One of the biggest arguments the SEC has had against spot crypto ETFs is the claim that crypto assets are unregistered securities lacking proper disclosures and, as such, are unsafe for the investing public.However, as Geraci alluded to, the SEC’s approval of futures ETFs tracking these assets is antithetical to its stance against spot ETFs, as successfully argued by Grayscale in its appeal of the SEC’s decision to initially reject its spot Bitcoin ETF application.This successful Grayscale appeal, in many ways, may have forced the SEC’s hands to approve spot Bitcoin ETFs, as SEC Chair Gary Gensler cited the ruling in his deciding vote. The agency would no doubt prefer to avoid similar lawsuits from Ethereum ETF applicants. Regardless of these considerations, most experts maintain that the chances of an Ethereum ETF approval remain significantly low, citing a lack of engagement between the SEC and applicants.Grayscale Chief Legal Officer Craig Salm has tried to downplay these sentiments, suggesting that most of the heavy lifting was already done with spot Bitcoin ETFs.Amid the back and forth, all eyes remain fixed on the final deadline for an SEC decision on pending applications in May 2024.On the Flipside
With barely two months to go, it is unclear how the SEC will label Ethereum a security and compel the Ethereum Foundation to comply with disclosure requirements before the May deadline.



The details of the SEC probe of the Ethereum Foundation remain unclear.
Why This MattersBlackRock is the world’s largest asset manager, with over $10 trillion in assets under management (AuM). The firm’s near-excellent track record of gaining ETF approvals put a lot of weight behind Larry Fink’s statements.Read this for more on the Ethereum ETF drama:Ethereum ETF Approval Odds Dim to 25% Due to SEC’s InactionStay up to date with the latest from the SEC case against Coinbase:Coinbase Loses SEC Case Dismissal Bid: How Big Is the Blow?

Bitcoin snatches daily NFT throne from Ethereum


Bitcoin has topped the non-fungible token (NFT) market in sales performance on Thursday, with a slight decrease of 0.06% in sales. 
The blockchain registered US$11.89 million in sales, with a negligible change in its all-time sales volume, maintaining a steady market presence.
JIGO BRC-20 NFTs, a Bitcoin-based collection, led Thursday’s NFT collection rankings with almost US$2 million.
Bitcoin now has US$2.989 billion in all-time NFT sales. The blockchain is on pace to close the trading week by joining the US$3 billion club.



Ethereum and Solana followed, ranking second and third respectively, but with more notable fluctuations in their sales figures.
Ethereum fell out of the top spot on Thursday after a sales decrease of 13.72% to US$10.16 million. 
Solana’s 24.45% sales increase was not enough to overtake the slumping Ethereum, as it came in third with US$8.18 million.
Polygon continued raising its daily total with US$1.5 million, the second consecutive day of at least US$1 million in sales. 



Mythos Chain failed to follow Polygon’s lead as it fell below the US$1 million mark it reached yesterday.

                        YouTuber Logan Paul addressed accusations regarding his infamous CryptoZoo non-fungible token (NFT) in a March 27 documentary titled “5 Months with Logan Paul,” stating that the project was not a scam. The documentary sheds light on Paul’s perspective on the project.This documentary featured journalist Graham Besinger, detailing the demise of the NFT project and the backlash and allegations that sprung up.Logan Paul Admits Allegations Has “Element of Truth”
Besinger had alleged in the documentary that Logan Paul’s CryptoZoo NFT was a mess that caused huge losses for people, leading to a spate of allegations and threats against the YouTuber.VIDEOPaul admitted that while the allegations had an element of truth, the NFT project was not a scam.“Everything you just said has an element of truth to it,” he said. “Here’s the problem. What you just described isn’t a scam. I took on a project that I was simply incapable of handling at the time.”He further disclosed that he didn’t profit from the project but suffered a loss of “half a million dollars.”Meanwhile, the YouTuber noted that the failure of CryptoZoo led him to have suicidal thoughts.“For the first time in my life I was having suicidal thoughts,” he stated. “I was just spiraling, Graham. Spiraling. I was crying, like sobbing … I felt weak, which is uncommon for me. I’m supposed to be the leader.”It could be recalled that Logan Paul first announced the CryptoZoo NFT project on his YouTube podcast in August 2021.VIDEOThe project was inspired by Pokémon but was designed as a fun game where collectors could purchase eggs and breed them to produce rare NFTs.And while the project generated a lot of excitement, it never really took off. This was after collectors had purchased the initial 10,000 collectibles (priced at 0.1 ETH at the team). The dev team found it difficult to bring the game to fruition, as they announced multiple delays till time passed.Shortly after CryptoZoo’s collapse, Coffeezilla, a popular YouTube journalist, published a three-part docuseries to expose issues with the game alongside a series of investors who suffered financial losses.VIDEOCoffeezilla’s exposè revealed that Logan Paul employed multiple con men to work on the project, including a developer known as “Z,” who held the CryptoZoo source code hostage for $1M.A class-action lawsuit was filed against Logan Paul in February 2023 based on the allegations that CryptoZoo was a “fraudulent venture.”Despite the lawsuit, Paul announced a $2.3M buyback program in January 2024, pledging to purchase all NFTs at their original prices. The tokens are down 99% from their all-time high of $0.0004963 in August 2021.Crypto Scams Continue to Soar High
While the CryptoZoo NFT fiasco may have taken center stage, crypto scams continue to increase, with the growing number of traders and investors interested in digital assets.According to BBB Scam Tracker annual data, over 67,000 scams were reported in 2023, alongside huge financial losses.Chainalysis 2024 crypto crime trends report also showed that illicit addresses received $39.6B and $24.2B worth of cryptocurrency in 2022 and 2023, respectively.Chainalysis crime trend report shows $24.2B was received by fraudulent addresses in 2023.Another report by Scam Sniffer revealed that hackers used a phishing crypto scam to drain $300M from 320K traders and investors in 2023. The web3 anti-scam solution company also reported that $46.86 million worth of crypto was stolen from scams in February 2024.

Shiba Inu's Price Surges 7% Amid Bullish Market Recovery, Dogecoin20 Set for Explosive Launch Following $10 Million Presale



                    
The Shiba Inu cryptocurrency experienced a 7% increase in its value over the last 24 hours, with its price reaching $0.00002995 at 03:51 a.m. EST, based on a trading volume that saw a 42% rise to $2.2 billion. 



This surge comes as SHIB successfully breached the $0.00003 price mark, boasting a 211% rise within just 30 days, hinting at a potential rebound to its annual peak of $0.00004563, recorded on March 5.




March was a significant month for Shiba Inu, marked by considerable gains and a stark increase to a resistance level at $0.00004568. 



However, facing resistance led to a correction, mirroring a broader market downtrend. 



Despite this, SHIB supporters have rallied from lower support levels, notably around $0.000020, propelling the cryptocurrency above a declining wedge pattern. 




This movement is backed by a broader market recovery, fueling bullish momentum.



Technical indicators underscore the bullish outlook, with Shiba Inu standing above both the 50-day and 200-day Simple Moving Averages (SMAs), indicating sustained upward momentum. 



The Relative Strength Index (RSI) reflects this optimism, showing a rebound from the 50-midline level at 56, aligning with SHIB’s breakout above the falling wedge pattern’s upper boundary.



The Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) presents a bullish narrative as well, with a blue line crossover above the orange signal line, further affirmed by rising green bars on the histogram indicating positive momentum.

These indicators suggest a strong bullish bias, with targets set beyond the immediate resistance towards $0.000040.



However, there remains a risk of bearish pressure that could see prices retract to support levels if current momentum wanes. 



Amidst this climate, Dogecoin20 emerges as a noteworthy mention, with its launch scheduled for April 20, following a highly successful presale phase that quickly raised $10 million.



Dogecoin20, viewed as an evolution of the DOGE meme coin, is anticipated to outperform predecessors like Shiba Inu and Dogecoin itself. 



The project aims for environmental friendliness and introduces on-chain staking with a compelling 98% annual percentage yield (APY), allocating 15% of its 140 billion total token supply for staking rewards over two years.



Marking April 20 as International Doge Day, the Dogecoin20 team aligns its launch with a day celebrated by enthusiasts, offering a strategic investment window for those eager to participate. 



The presale’s extension provides a final opportunity to purchase DOGE20 tokens at $0.00022 each, with transactions facilitated through ETH, USDT, or bank cards, urging quick action from interested investors before the close.

Vitalik Buterin discusses what is next for Ethereum, following Dencun hard fork - Blockworks


Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin believes that following the Dencun hard fork, scaling on Ethereum is no longer a “zero-to-one” problem but rather a “one-to-N” problem.
Initially, Ethereum’s development was centered around building its foundational infrastructure, effectively going from non-existence (zero) to establishing the baseline of a functional ecosystem (one). This phase was marked by significant challenges, like limited scalability and high transaction fees. These issues constrained Ethereum’s ability to support widespread adoption of dapps and maintain operational efficiency.
Following the Dencun update, Ethereum has pivoted to a more scalable infrastructure, highlighted by innovations such as proto-danksharding and, importantly, “blobs” for more efficient data handling and notably lower transaction costs. These advancements mark a transition from laying down the network’s foundational framework to enhancing and broadening its capabilities. Developers will now work to scale from a solid baseline (one) to new, undefined heights (represented as N; an indefinite, but foreseeably large number).
Read more: What does EIP 4844 mean for Ethereum rollups?
The Dencun upgrade went live on Ethereum on March 13. It featured EIP-4844, or proto-danksharding, which introduced “blob” transactions or sharded data. These transactions are designed to place data into “blobs” and guarantee data availability, subsequently reducing transaction costs on rollups.
Following the upgrade, Buterin notes that important scaling work still needs to be done, like improving rollups’ ability to optimize each blob, though the fundamental problems around scaling have already been addressed. 
Additionally, Ethereum has been slowly shifting from becoming a layer-1 ecosystem to a layer-2-centric ecosystem, with many applications moving towards building on layer-2s.
With this in mind, Buterin remarks that the next stage of Ethereum development will likely focus on bringing data availability sampling (DAS) to life, specifically PeerDAS.
PeerDAS is designed to reuse battle-tested peer-to-peer components to enhance Ethereum data availability scaling beyond EIP-4844 while minimizing the amount of work that honest nodes need to do. 
Read more: Parallelized EVMs are gaining popularity, but they won’t scale blockchains alone
“In PeerDAS, each node stores a significant fraction (e.g. 1/8) of all blob data, and nodes maintain connections to many peers in the p2p network. When a node needs to sample for a particular piece of data, it asks one of the peers that it knows is responsible for storing that piece,” Buterin wrote.
Using PeerDAS, more solo stakers can also participate in securing the network. They can download 1/8th of the data instead of a full blob, which helps decentralize the network. 
Besides DAS, Buterin also highlights four key areas of improvement for layer-2s. First, he notes that layer-2s can explore data compression techniques to decrease byte size for transactions. Secondly, it is worthwhile exploring Plasma as a technique, which will mean that data is only posted on layer-1s in exceptional circumstances.
Read more: What is Plasma and why is Vitalik Buterin into it all over again?
Additionally, he remarks that layer-2s should investigate improving execution-related constraints and security as well as code reliability, noting that existing ecosystem standards are too lenient. 
“Ethereum is no longer just a financial ecosystem. It’s a full-stack replacement for large parts of ‘centralized tech,’ and even provides some things that centralized tech does not. And we need to build with this broader ecosystem in mind,” Buterin wrote.

Blob base fee surges, Ethereum misses slots as ‘BlobScriptions’ go viral - Blockworks


On Wednesday morning, the website Ethscriptions created a way to mint inscriptions on EIP-4844 blobs, which are cost-saving packets of data introduced in Ethereum’s recent Dencun upgrade.
As with other blockchains that have received the inscription treatment, so-called BlobScriptions have heavily driven up the price of blockspace — or in this case, blobspace. 
Since Dencun, the base fee for a blob, or the minimum gas price needed for a blob to be included in the next Ethereum block, has been one wei, an Ethereum-denominated price that is equivalent to a fraction of $0.01. 
Read more: The biggest Ethereum upgrade ever goes live
Today, the blob base fee climbed above 500 gwei, according to ultrasound.money. One gwei is worth a billion wei.
At the time of writing, the blob fee was roughly 6 gwei, marking a 60 trillion percent increase over the one wei blobs cost in the two weeks since Dencun. Six gwei is equal to around $0.20, according to CoinBrain. 
Notably, the much-increased blob fee is still lower than the price of gas on Ethereum’s layer-1, which stands at around 37 gwei, per Etherscan.
Nevertheless, at a price of one wei, blob space was effectively “free,” Blocknative CEO Matt Cutler told Blockworks in a text. “But the current Blob Base Fee is measured in Gwei and that’s far from free.”
Inscriptions — which have seen a resurgence in popularity on Bitcoin in recent months — create an inexpensive means of embedding art or would-be tokens onto a blockchain. In the case of BlobScriptions, a host of pictures and tokens are now being inscribed on blobs.
What’s important to note, however, is that blob data is only kept by Ethereum nodes for roughly 18 days to let layer-2s verify transactions. So after 18 days, BlobScriptions will disappear from Ethereum. But BlobScriptions will still be stored in the indexer for creator protocol Ethscriptions, co-founder Tom Lehman said on X.
Read more: What does EIP 4844 mean for Ethereum rollups?
In the four hours before press time, 41% of created blobs were inscription mints, according to a Dune dashboard. By way of comparison, popular layer-2s Arbitrum, Base, and Optimism each accounted for roughly 9% of blobs in the same time span. 
Lehman told Blockworks his goal in using blobs for inscriptions was to let people get around using expensive smart contracts for data storage. 
“We created Blobscriptions to enable ordinary people — not just giant layer-2s — to benefit from EIP-4844 blobs,” Lehman said in a direct message.
Ethereum also saw an increase in missed slots Wednesday afternoon, though there was disagreement among researchers as to whether the slots were being missed due to blob inscriptions or something else.
Either way, blob inscriptions could impede the low-fee promised land layer-2s have lived in for the past two weeks.
“[Is] this an ephemeral fad or a behavior that is here to stay? Time will tell,” Cutler wrote.

U.S. Treasury Department Targets 13 Russian Firms Allegedly Offering Crypto-Related Services To Avoid Sanctions - The Daily Hodl


								The US Government has named entities and individuals allegedly responsible for providing crypto products and services that aided in the evasion of sanctions on Russia.
The U.S. Department of the Treasury’s Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) says that it has “sanctioned thirteen entities and two individuals for operating in the financial services and technology sectors of the Russian Federation economy.”










According to the agency, many of the designated individuals and entities “facilitated transactions or offered other services that helped OFAC-designated entities evade sanctions.”
Among the designated entities include the Moscow-based fintech firm B-Crypto, which OFAC accuses of partnering with Rosbank to enable Russian exporters to make cross-border payments using crypto assets. Rosbank is a Russian commercial bank that is also under US sanctions.
Other designated entities are Moscow-based fintech firms Masterchain, Laitkhaus, and Atomaiz. Peer-to-peer crypto exchange Bitpapa and centralized digit asset exchange Crypto Explorer were also sanctioned.
Firms based outside Russia that were sanctioned include Eastern European companies such as the Cyprus-based Tokentrust Holdings and the Estonia-based Bitfingroup.
Blockchain technology firms Veb3 Integrator and Veb3 Tekhnologii as well as fintech firm TOEP which operates a crypto exchange were also placed on the list of entities supporting the evasion of sanctions by Russian firms and individuals. The two firms are based in Moscow.
The two sanctioned individuals are Igor Veniaminovich Kaigorodov, the majority shareholder of Veb3 Integrator and Veb3 Tekhnologii and Timur Evgenyevich Bukanov, the owner and director of TOEP.
While some of America’s economic and trade sanctions on Russia have existed for decades, some of the most severe ones were placed following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine in February of 2022.
Last year in May, it was reported that the world’s largest crypto exchange Binance was being investigated by US authorities over possible violation of sanctions on Russia.

HSBC rolls out tokenized gold for Hong Kong retail investors 1

Renowned financial institution HSBC has entered the blockchain technology industry by making tokenized gold available for retail investors in Hong Kong. This initiative makes HSBC the first bank to provide retail investors with a tokenized real-world asset (RWAs) on a blockchain platform.HSBC rolls out its gold token for retail investorsAccording to its announcement, the HSBC Gold token is now available on its HSBC Online Banking and the HSBC HK Mobile App. In addition, the gold token can be minted on the Orion digital asset platform owned by the bank. This move reflects a bigger shift towards tokenizing real-world assets (RWAs) in the financial and banking industry.Tokenization is simply representing real-world assets as digital assets on a blockchain. This process, which usually offers enhanced security, transparency, and accessibility to users is either on private ledgers or on public blockchains like Ethereum. The firm’s decision to enter the tokenized gold market shows a growing demand for blockchain-based solutions in the financial industry.The firm had previously made hints towards offering tokenized gold as part of its digital asset custody platform when it announced a collaboration with Switzerland-based safekeeping platform Metaco. The successful launch of its gold token shows the bank’s commitment to offering innovative financial products by leveraging distributed ledger technology.HSBC’s Hong Kong’s head of wealth and personal banking Maggie Ng expressed pride in the HSBC Gold Token. The executive highlighted its status as the first retail product in Hong Kong based on distributed ledger technology authorized by the Securities and Futures Commission (SFC). This approval also adds credibility to the blockchain-based offering of the bank, setting a precedent for similar products in the region.Advantages of tokenized gold for investorsHolding tokenized gold has several advantages for retail investors. Due to the conversation from physical gold to digital tokens, investors can hold a fraction of gold. Aside from that, HSBC also eliminates the need to store gold in physical form while aiding seamless transactions. Moreso, using the blockchain enhances trust while ensuring the immutability and traceability of the tokenized assets.This recent move by HSBC mirrors the trend in the broader financial industry, where financial institutions are looking into blockchain-bass solutions for tokenization among other things like custody and transactions. The integration of blockchain technology into traditional banking shows a shift towards the digital ecosystem and innovation in the financial sector.With blockchain technology gaining momentum across various industries, HSBC’s move underscores the potential of distributed ledger technology. Also, by tokenizing gold and making it available to investors, the firm is opening up new opportunities for investment and financial inclusion in Hong Kong’s market landscape.The launch of the tokenized gold by HABC on its Orion digital assets platform is a landmark milestone in the adoption of blockchain technology in the financial sector. Aside from providing investors with tokenized gold, it also showcases HSBC as a flag bearer in leveraging blockchain for financial products.

Dormant Bitcoins on the Move: An Unexpected Boon for BTC? - DailyCoin


        
Old Bitcoin holdings have been consolidated and moved, sparking talks of strategic asset repositioning.



The Bitcoin halving event is approaching and has historically been linked to price increases.



This recent Bitcoin movement has followed prior instances of dormant BTC being awakened.
The Bitcoin market has witnessed a flurry of activity recently, with large sums of the cryptocurrency changing hands. These movements have sparked discussions among analysts about a potential “sell-side liquidity crisis” brewing in the digital asset space.Bitcoin Consolidation Sparks Talk of Sell-OffOne particularly noteworthy transaction involved the consolidation of 2,000 Bitcoin, mined in 2010, into a single wallet. Developer Mononautical identified this activity, suggesting the coins may have been sold via an over-the-counter (OTC) trade. Ki Young Ju, CEO of crypto analytics firm CryptoQuant, believes this movement signifies a “sell-side liquidity crisis waking up old Bitcoin.”A sell-side liquidity crisis occurs when there’s a shortage of sellers willing to part with their assets. This scarcity can make it difficult for buyers to find sellers at their desired price points, potentially leading to price volatility.The recent consolidation comes amidst heightened anticipation surrounding the upcoming Bitcoin halving event, expected around 21 April 2024. This pre-programmed mechanism in Bitcoin’s code reduces the block reward for miners by half, effectively limiting the new Bitcoin entering circulation. This event historically coincides with price appreciation for Bitcoin.Recent Activity Has Analysts DividedAdding to the intrigue, another significant transfer occurred over the weekend. The fifth-wealthiest Bitcoin address, which held 94,500 since 2019, fragmented its holdings and sent them to three separate addresses. The purpose and plans for these transferred Bitcoins remain unclear.These large-scale movements follow an incident in January where an individual seemingly sent 26.9 Bitcoin to the irretrievable Bitcoin Genesis wallet, the first-ever wallet on the network. Additionally, in July 2023, a dormant wallet containing over 1,000 Bitcoin, inactive for eleven years, suddenly transferred its entire holdings.



While the exact motivations behind these recent Bitcoin movements remain to be seen, they collectively paint a picture of increased activity within the long-dormant segments of the cryptocurrency market. Whether this signifies a coming sell-off or a strategic repositioning of assets in anticipation of the halving event remains a topic of debate among analysts.On the Flipside
The consolidation of old Bitcoins could indicate renewed interest from early adopters, potentially bringing fresh investment to the market.



A sell-side liquidity crisis, if it occurs, can lead to price volatility as buyers might have to offer more to entice sellers or struggle to find sellers at all.
Why This MattersThe awakening of long-dormant Bitcoins and the upcoming halving injects uncertainty into the market. This uncertainty could trigger price volatility as analysts debate whether these movements foreshadow a potential sell-off or a pre-halving strategic play, impacting not just Bitcoin but potentially the broader cryptocurrency market.Curious about a large Bitcoin wallet that recently moved for the first time in four years?

KuCoin plans $10M airdrop of BTC, KCS as Justice Dept., CFTC circle

Cryptocurrency exchange KuCoin will hold an airdrop of Bitcoin (BTC) and its native KuCoin (KCS) token worth $10 million, according to a letter from CEO Johnny Lyu posted on the exchange’s blog on March 27. The news comes a day after the United States Justice Department announced charges against the exchange and two of  its founders.Lyu did not mention the federal charges, although he alluded to them in the first sentence of his letter:“I would like to express my gratitude to all KuCoin users, for your support, trust and companionship during the past few days.”Comparing the airdrop to the exchange’s reimbursement of its investors who lost money in the Confido rug pull, Lyu continued:“Recently, on March 26th and 27th, some users experienced longer-than-expected wait times during the withdrawal process. […] To express our profound gratitude for your support and patience KuCoin will launch a special airdrop event totaling 10 million USD in KCS and BTC.”Rules for the airdrop will be released in three days, Lyu wrote. The recent delays in withdrawals were possibly caused by the high volume as wary customers abandoned the exchange. The airdrop thus rewards users who remained loyal to the exchange in its time of crisis.Related: KuCoin agrees to ban New York residents and pay $22 million settlementThe timing of the airdrop is noteworthy since KuCoin was hit with a barrage of legal actions one day earlier. The Justice Department unsealed an indictment for violations of the Bank Secrecy Act for lacking an Anti-Money Laundering program by the two founders and operating an unlicensed money-transmitting business. Simultaneously, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) initiated a civil case against the exchange for violations of the Commodity Exchange Act and CFTC regulations.Source: Wu BlockchainKuCoin hastened to assure users that their assets were safe after the charges were filed and KCS fell 12% in 24 hours. Airdrops come with risks, not the least of which is the possibility of regulatory action. The SEC wrote in its document “Framework for “Investment Contract” Analysis of Digital Assets”: “The lack of monetary consideration for digital assets, such as those distributed via a so-called ‘air drop,’ does not mean that the investment of money prong [of the Howey test] is not satisfied; therefore, an airdrop may constitute a sale or distribution of securities.” The DeFi Education Fund teamed up with a small Texas clothing company sued for a declaratory judgment against the SEC to prevent the agency from prosecuting the company for holding an airdrop.Magazine: Cool green mayor giving a grand in Bitcoin to each resident

KuCoin Witnesses $1B In Withdrawals As Exchange Is Accused Of Money Laundering: 'SEC Trying To Protect Us From Making Money?' Questions Trader - Benzinga

Leading cryptocurrency exchange, KuCoin saw a massive $1 billion in crypto withdrawals over the past 24 hours, coinciding with a notable decrease in the exchange’s assets.What Happened: Arkham Intelligence data highlighted KuCoin exchange balance at $4.7 billion, down from more than $6 billion the prior day. This decline was attributed to a substantial amount of assets being withdrawn by investors amid allegations of money laundering against the exchange by the U.S. Department of Justice. U.S. Attorney Damian Williams stated, "KuCoin allegedly deliberately chose not to implement even basic anti-money laundering policies."The accused crypto exchange KuCoin witnessed around $1 billion in crypto withdrawals over the past 24 hours and assets under management plunged 20% amid the exchange facing charges from U.S. authorities, as reported by CoinDesk citing Nansen and Arkham Intelligence data.  Amidst many loopholes in the functioning of cryptocurrency exchange, Benzinga’s Future of Digital Assets conference, scheduled for Nov. 19, will bring industry leaders and investors together to discuss the future of digital asset investments.Also Read: Philippines Blocks Binance Over Unlicensed Operations, Citing Investor ProtectionWhy It Matters: The U.S. Department of Justice noted KuCoin purposely failed to comply with anti-money laundering laws to grow its platform. The indictment further detailed KuCoin's alleged attempts to conceal its activities from U.S. regulators, including not requiring customer identification and falsely claiming to have no U.S. customers, said a Benzinga article.A crypto trader, Doncrypto questioned, "What ever Kucoin did wrong? They even made it KYC mandatory to comply with regulations?”, adding “Why is SEC trying to protect us from making money?Notable NFT and crypto expert, Foster Hilt tweeted about KuCoin joining the list of exchanges facing scrutiny, alongside Binance, Coinbase and Kraken. Hilt emphasized the current lack of regulatory clarity in the U.S. cryptocurrency landscape.  Hilt’s tweet concluded with a reminder: “This is yet another reminder that regardless of how big or reputable an exchange appears to be, the best practice is to always self-custody your crypto.”The allegations against KuCoin, especially in the lead-up to the Bitcoin halving event, have broader implications for the crypto market and its operations as a whole. These topics are expected to be thoroughly explored at Benzinga’s upcoming Future of Digital Assets event on Nov. 19.Read Next: Coinbase’s Diverse Growth Path, From Trading Volumes to Blockchain Innovations: AnalystPhoto: Shutterstock

&nbsp

&nbsp
In the crypto world, new projects frequently emerge and battle for attention and market share. One newcomer making waves in the market is Book Of Meme (BOME), a cryptocurrency that has recently captured the spotlight with its impressive increase in trading volume and price. BOME has even gotten close to the trading volume of Shiba Inu. With BOME’s rapid pump, everyone is eager to know what lies ahead for this memecoin.



BOME’s Recent Rise



In the last 24 hours, BOME experienced a remarkable pump in its price and trading volume, showing increased interest from traders and investors. BOME increased by 6.4% in price and 13.4% in trading volume, totalling an impressive $1.5 billion. This surge in trading activity has put BOME ahead of Shiba Inu, a cryptocurrency often dubbed the “Dogecoin Killer,” which recorded a trading volume of $1.2 billion over the same period.



This buzz surrounding BOME is happening due to several factors, such as listings on major crypto exchanges.



In addition to the listings, BOME’s derivatives data shows further optimism among investors. A notable 30% rise in volume and open interest reaching $143.4 million suggest strong demand for the memecoin. Specifically, over the last 24 hours, traders have been even more active as the number of liquidations has risen, mostly coming from long positions.



What’s Next for BOME?



Prominent crypto technical analyst Kyledoops has also weighed in on BOME’s potential, suggesting that the coin’s breakout from resistance levels has settled at a good support level. This move and its strength in testing these levels hint at a possible sustained pump. The analyst’s sentiments reflect the optimism around BOME as it continues to climb through the crypto rankings.

As BOME continues to challenge established players in the crypto space, there are still questions about its long-term stability. Will BOME emerge as a powerful contender, maintaining its momentum and gaining substantial market share, or will it become a victim of volatility and fall off like most meme coins?

'Call of Duty' Players Have Their Bitcoin Swiped Thanks to Malware - Decrypt

Call of Duty players seeking out third-party “cheat” software to manipulate the popular first-person shooter game were among the victims of a targeted phishing attack, cybersecurity firm VX Underground said on Wednesday.The attack also targeted players seeking “pay-to-cheat” software for use on Activision Blizzard’s Battle.net, the PC platform for games like World of Warcraft, Overwatch, and Diablo. The cheat software installed crypto-drainer malware onto the user’s computer, and could be used to gain access to information to swipe coins from their Bitcoin wallets.“Over the past couple of days, we have become aware of malware targeting gamers!” VX Underground said on Twitter. “More specifically, a currently unidentified threat actor is utilizing an "info stealer" to target individuals who cheat (pay-to-cheat) in video games.”According to VX Underground, the crypto-draining malware potentially impacted more than 4.9 million accounts in total, including nearly 3.7 million Battle.net accounts, over 560,000 Activision accounts, and about 117,000 ElitePVPers accounts.Crypto wallet drainers refer to malware that, once installed, targets a user's hot wallet, either installed as an application on their computer or browser extension. In January, cybersecurity firm Kaspersky warned Mac users of an exploit targeting Bitcoin and Exodus Wallets.VX Underground said the drainer in this case targeted Electrum Bitcoin wallets, but acknowledged that the exact amount stolen is unknown.“The scope of the impact is so large, and in a bizarre twist of fate, Activision Blizzard is coordinating with cheat providers to aid users impacted by the massive info stealer campaign,” they said.Also included in the malware attack were cheat providers UnknownCheats and PhantomOverlay, which had 572,831 and 1,365 compromised accounts, respectively. As VX Underground explained, PhantomOverlay was alerted to the attack by users who reported unauthorized purchases.“When Elite PVPers was approached by PhantomOverlay administrative staff about the compromised accounts, Elite PVPers confirmed they have identified 40,000+ valid user accounts compromised,” VX Underground said.VX Underground did not immediately respond to Decrypt’s request for comment.A spokesperson for Activision Blizzard emphasized that the attack was not just related to their games and platforms, and is not directly related to their own servers.“There have been claims that some player credentials across the broader industry could be compromised from malware from downloading or using unauthorized software. Activision Blizzard servers remain secure and uncompromised,” the spokesperson told Decrypt in an email.“Our priority is always player account security,” the Activision statement continues. “If players believe they may have clicked on a suspicious link or if they want to ensure their account is protected, they can change their password and follow recommended best practices here, such as adding [two-factor authentication].”At the time of writing, VX Underground still did not know how hackers delivered the malware, but traditionally, malware comes through malicious websites, phishing emails, or messages that install programs on the victim's computer after being clicked.Other forms of malware—for example, cloned websites—drain wallets after the victim signs a transaction in their browser wallet, unwittingly giving the hackers access to their funds and NFTs.On Tuesday, the founder of Bitcoin Ordinals project Ordinal Rugs said they were the victim of a wallet drainer phishing attack targeting the Bitcoin Rock Discord server. Thieves stole $1.47 BTC, around $103,003, and 4 BTC, around $208,196, worth of Ordinal inscriptions from the wallet of pseudonymous founder, Archon.“No funds/accounts/logins related to [Ordinal Rugs] were affected... this was just my own personal wallet and I only have myself to blame here,” Archon said on Twitter. “Needless to say, I will not allow this to happen again.”Edited by Andrew HaywardStay on top of crypto news, get daily updates in your inbox.

Will Dogecoin Surge Catalyze Explosive Altseason? - DailyCoin


        
The Dogecoin price is riding an uptrend this week. 



Some observers posit DOGE’s uptrend will trigger altseason.



Bitcoin dominance has leveled off at present.
This week, Elon Musk fueled speculation around integrating crypto payments on his X social media platform. Dogecoin, known as Musk’s favorite cryptocurrency, rallied in response to the speculation, culminating in a 17% gain to lead the top 100 on Thursday. This surge triggered theories that a Dogecoin frenzy may be the catalyst to kick off a broader altcoin season across the market.Dogecoin to Lead Altseason?With Dogecoin soaring this week, crypto YouTuber Scott Melker retweeted a post from a few weeks ago theorizing the connection between DOGE’s movement higher and altcoin season. In this post, Melker posited that mainstream FOMO will return to crypto once Dogecoin makes a new all-time high. In support of this theory, the YouTuber stated that the previous bull cycle was kicked off “mainstream fervor,” as characterized by users facing multi-month waitlists to open exchange accounts to buy memecoins like Dogecoin, as well as the prevalence of NFT mania.Adding further credence to Melker’s theory, trader Donovan Jolley mentioned that Dogecoin’s biggest rallies and subsequent altseasons have tended to come shortly after Bitcoin dominance dips. With BTC.D wavering recently, Jolley sees this as a potential trigger for altseason. The crypto markets broadly oscillate between “Bitcoin season,” when BTC outperforms, and “altcoin season,” when alternative cryptocurrencies capture greater investor interest as Bitcoin’s dominance wanes. However, Blockchain Center believes the market is firmly in Bitcoin season. Far From Altseason Data from Blockchain Center indicated the market is currently firmly entrenched in Bitcoin season. The platform’s “Alt-Season Index,” which measures the percentage of the top 50 cryptocurrencies outperforming Bitcoin over 90 days, registered a current score of just 47%. The threshold for altseason is once this index crosses 75% of the top 50 tokens, outperforming BTC over the last 90 days.Alt-Season Index per Blockchain Center While there was a brief two-week altseason in mid-to-late January and again for one day on March 6, according to Blockchain Center metrics, we must go back to August 2022 for the last sustained period of altcoin outperformance. That altseason lasted roughly six weeks before fading by mid-September 2022. On the Flipside
Correlation is not causation, and waning Bitcoin dominance cannot be directly attributed to DOGE price rallies.



Altcoin gains during altseason are generally orders of magnitude greater than large caps, as it takes more capital to increase the market cap of established tokens.



While Dogecoin has been soaring lately, DOGE is still 70% below its ATH.
Why This MattersWhile there has been no shortage of Dogecoin clones lately, the original memecoin’s continued dominance of that niche sector and its potential to catalyze an altseason, underscores DOGE’s remarkable staying power after all these years.Read more on Dogecoin outperforming the rest of the market here:

Canadian Authorities Probe $169M QuadrigaCX Crypto Scam In New Wealth Investigation | Bitcoinist.com


								In a significant development, the Canadian province of British Columbia seeks to employ an unexplained wealth order (UWO) against Michael Patryn, co-founder of the Quadriga Coin Exchange (QuadrigaCX). 
The UWO is a newly introduced court order that compels individuals to disclose the source of their assets. The Minister of Public Safety and Attorney General of Canada, Mike Farnworth, said that the filing of the UWO demonstrates the government’s commitment to taking decisive action against criminals and organized crime.
Government’s Pursuit Of QuadrigaCX Extends
The Quadriga Coin Exchange, founded in Canada by Gerald Cotten and Michael Patryn and the focus of British Columbia’s UWO, gained international notoriety for its criminal activities that caused substantial financial losses to numerous individuals. 

Farnworth highlights QuadrigaCX’s connection to a high-profile cryptocurrency fraud documentary on Netflix as illustrative of the nature of such crimes. The government emphasizes that “robust” enforcement measures that undermine criminal organizations’ profit motives are essential to effectively combating these crimes.
In addition, the Attorney General notes that the case received further attention when it was featured in an episode of Law and Order Toronto entitled “The Key to the Castle: Criminal Intent” in February 2024. 
According to Farnworth’s statement, if successful, the motion would result in the forfeiture of various assets, including $250,200 in cash, 45 gold bars, four luxury watches, and valuable jewelry. The Attorney General’s statement concluded:
We will continue to take the assets from unlawful activity and redirect the proceeds of crime to much-needed victim services programs and crime prevention initiatives, such as the anti-hate grants to communities announced on Feb. 15, 2024.
Allegations Of Personal Gain From Customer Assets
While a 2020 report from the Ontario Securities Commission did not result in charges, it concluded that only Gerald Cotten had engaged in fraudulent activities. The report stated that Patryn had ceased associating with QuadrigaCX in 2016, and most client funds were deposited after his departure.
However, in the civil forfeiture case filed in British Columbia’s court last year, the province alleged that an investigation revealed Patryn and Cotten had misappropriated customer assets for personal use and financial gain. The province’s claim mentions Patryn’s involvement in purchasing and maintaining a safety deposit box and its contents.
Lovie Horner, Patryn’s common-law spouse, was identified as one of the individuals who deposited money into the bank account between 2014 and 2020, according to the forfeiture case.

In 2005, Michael Patryn, then known as Omar Dhanani, was convicted in the United States for his involvement in a conspiracy to transfer identification documents related to an online money-laundering service.
Meanwhile, in December 2018, Gerald Cotten, the co-founder of QuadrigaCX, embarked on a trip to India with his newlywed wife, Jennifer Robertson. During the trip, Cotten, who suffers from Crohn’s disease, became seriously ill. 
Despite medical attention, his health deteriorated, leading to his untimely death shortly after his hospitalization. About a month later, QuadrigaCX officially announced Cotten’s death in a statement attributed to Jennifer Robertson.

Crypto community mixed reactions to SBF's 25-year sentence

In a historic sentence on SBF enabling the crash of the FTX cryptocurrency exchange,  Judge Lewis Kaplan, who supervised the extreme case, sentenced the former FTX chief SBF  to 25 years in prison. On March 28th, the court convicted the defendant on bank robbery charges and fraudulent currency issuance. Amid the concerns about the case, its significance to the crypto community and beyond has drawn wide attention.25 years behind barsJudge Kaplan meted a sentence to Bankman-Fried on 28 March after the trial, deliberating over the magnitude of punishment for Bankman-Fried’s conviction. Initially, prosecutors had argued for a maximum sentence of 50 years, while the defense team had petitioned for leniency, saying that a sentence of up to 6 and a half years would be more appropriate. On the other hand, the judge did not see Bankman-Fried’s act as lenient, and the sentence was 25 years, considering witness intimidation and perjury aggravating factors.Crypto community reaction and legality perspectiveUnlike major crimes, suicide is not a death penalty-eligible offense, and that does not necessarily mean longer sentences. After the statement, many people expressed mixed feelings about their opportunities on social networks. This point was made clear by some people who believe this sentence was too short and insufficient because it reflected the gravity of the crime committed. These people used longer sentences for lesser crimes as their arguments. What is even more remarkable is Edward Snowden contrasting Bankman Fred’s crime to that of Chelsea Manning, who had gotten 35 years of jail for leaking classified information violation. To him, Bankman Fred did the ‘way worse’ than what Manning had done.Legal specialists talked about this judgment, suggesting that. In contrast, it is understandable that the prison terms do not exceed 100 years based on the existing sentencing guidelines; the sentence handed down was quite significant and was a good sign that accountability exists in the crypto space. Mark Bini, former Assistant U.S. Attorney, pointed out that the judge emphasized the multiple sentencing factors making the ruling commensurable and the real consequences for anyone convicted of crypto crimes.Discussion concerning justice and accuracyIn addition to certain individuals trying to rest as the ball was going in the right direction, others were unhappy with the result. Terrence Yang, CEO of Swan Bitcoin, said “too lightly,” Bankman-Fried definitely cannot be given only 1 year in jail because many people have been financially broken because of his behavior. Yang mentioned the pain and destruction in those families and their lives, as well as the coldness of the former CEO, during the following session. Regardless of the requests for Proposition to be less ruthless due to Ber Jake’s diagnosis, Yang stated that the gravity of crime deserved to be punished harder.Bankman Fried was then directly marched out of the courtroom to the metropolitan detention center in Brooklyn, where he has been detained since the revocation of his bail in August of 2023. The story is still developing: Ryan Salem, the former FTX Digital Markets co-CEO, will be sentenced on May 1st. Other Alameda Research and FTX directors have already admitted their guilt and taken the deals, raising the expectations for the following court hearings.

What Will Happen to FTX's $7.5 Billion Solana (SOL) Token? Will It Be Sold? Here's What's Known - Bitcoin Sistemi

According to sources close to the discussions on the subject, the sale of 41 million locked Solana tokens worth $ 7.5 billion by the bankrupt cryptocurrency exchange FTX company attracted great attention.
Galaxy Asset Management was selected by FTX company to broker the token sales in September 2023, as the company believed it would provide these services in a cost-effective and confidential manner.


Neptune Digital became the first company to publicly announce that it purchased the locked Solana token from FTX. The firm purchased 26,964 SOL at $64 per token. 20% of these tokens will be unlocked in March 2025, while the rest will be unlocked monthly until 2028.
Galaxy Trading is among the funds raising capital from investors to bid for part of the locked-up Solana. Investors can participate at $64 per token. The fund will charge a management fee of 1%. While BitGo will be the custodian of the tokens and the fund will distribute staking rewards in parallel with purchases, the rewards are currently planned to be locked together with the underlying tokens.






While some of the deals have now been completed, some of the tokens are still pending. Although not yet confirmed, these are expected to be available late next month.
According to Bloomberg, Pantera was raising money from investors to create a fund to buy Solana from FTX, which was valued at $250 million. Phoenix Digital was also aiming to raise funds for a similar strategy, but the proposal did not materialize, according to two sources. FalconX was also raising funds to make a large offer for FTX.


In addition to Solana tokens, Galaxy Asset Management is selling 42 more tokens primarily based on Solana and Ethereum, with a total value of approximately $211 million. These include $29.4 million GT, $23 million ATLAS, $23 million Shadow Token, and $20 million Bitfinex token UNUS SED LEO.

What is Dogecoin? Explaining Elon Musk's favorite cryptocurrency

Whether you’re interested in crypto or not, you’ve probably heard of Dogecoin. This meme-based cryptocurrency — Elon Musk’s favorite — is making headlines again. Why Amazon stock gains are changing employee compensationThe cryptocurrency soared nearly 50% in a week to $0.22 on rumors that Musk would add it to X as a payment method.It all started with Musk’s cryptic post on March 25, in which he shared an image linking X’s logo with a payment company, calling it an “everything app.” In the caption, he wrote, “The circle will be complete.”Musk had once mentioned that the everything app would replace YouTube, LinkedIn, dating apps, and even banks. The post has raised the hopes of Dogecoin lovers who are waiting for X to accept it as a payment method. Musk and Doge have a long-standing relationship. Let’s recap their affair.Who created Dogecoin? Created as a joke by software engineers Billy Markus and Jackson Palmer in 2013, Dogecoin features the likeness of the Shiba Inu dog popularized in the Doge meme.But what initially began as a joke would transform into one of the world’s most valuable cryptocurrencies.How did Dogecoin get overnight success? The credit for Doge’s success goes to the GameStop saga that began in January 2021. The meme stock reached its peak when a group of small investors, encouraged by the Reddit community WallStreetBets and helped along by an Elon Musk tweet, skyrocketed GameStop shares to $86.88 in January 2021.On Reddit, investors later discussed what cryptocurrency is equivalent to meme stock GameStop — and the answer was Dogecoin. That’s how Dogecoin came into the limelight, and just as GameStop reached its peak, Dogecoin started to gain traction, peaking in May 2021 at $0.74 per coin.When Musk became a proud DogefatherAfter the GameStop saga, another event sent Dogecoin to the moon. One fine day, Elon Musk tweeted a word on Twitter: Doge. The price surged dramatically as media attention was garnered, and crypto enthusiasts suddenly became interested in Dogecoin.Later in the year, Musk hosted NBC’s “Saturday Night Live” and called himself a Dogefather. He continued promoting Dogecoin on various platforms, leading to its inclusion in the top 10 cryptocurrencies by market capitalization.Musk’s obsession with Dogecoin continued. Once, he said Doge is his favorite cryptocurrency because “it has the best humor and it has dogs.”Doge has the back of Tesla and SpaceXMusk also made sure to incorporate Dogecoin into his electric vehicle and space mission. At Tesla, Dogecoin can be used to purchase select merchandise, like Cyberquad for Kids, Giga Texas Belt Buckle, and Cyberwhistle.Musk hinted recently that Dogecoin could be accepted as a payment method at Tesla in the future.Moreover, SpaceX has also accepted Dogecoin as payment for the rescheduling of the DOGE-1 lunar mission.Will X accept Doge as a payment method?When X was still Twitter in 2021, it already accepted Bitcoin as a payment method for tipping. This was regarded as the first experiment in which cryptocurrency was used as a payment method on any social media.So, the acceptance of Doge as a payment method on X won’t come as a complete surprise. If and when X accepts Doge, it could just send Dogecoin and other cryptocurrencies to the moon once again.

Crypto Trader Breaks Down Bitcoin’s Break Out, Says Altcoins Will Soon Wake Up - The Daily Hodl


								A widely followed crypto analyst is keeping an eye on altcoins as Bitcoin (BTC) leads the markets with its latest break out.
Crypto trader Michaël van de Poppe tells his 708,300 followers on the social media platform X that BTC just needs to stay above $67,000 to retest its all-time high (ATH).










“Bitcoin holds above crucial levels. 
As long as it stays above $67,000, we’ll be good to have another ATH test.
Overall, upwards returns seem relatively skewed for Bitcoin pre-halving.”
Source: Michaël van de Poppe/X
BTC is worth $71,169 at time of writing, just shy of its ATH of $73,737 earlier this month.
According to Van de Poppe, retail traders aren’t taking much interest in BTC at the moment.
“Bitcoin is at an all-time high, but retail doesn’t seem to have interest.
Altcoins are still at rock bottom levels, and yet, no interest.
While this is the time to have interest in them, as these opportunities don’t come that often.”
Van de Poppe also says that trading altcoins successfully comes with a “narrow window.”
“In my opinion; the key to success is to hold your positions for a mid-long period, but also being able to compound your positions.
Altcoins have a narrow window of success in which those profits should be swapped to BTC.”
Looking specifically at Cosmos (ATOM), the analyst says the altcoin’s movements could be indicative of the entire altcoin market.
“I’m pleased to see strength in ATOM. 
Slowly, but surely, altcoins will wake up.”
ATOM is worth $12.45 at time of writing, up 5% in the last week.

Bitwise files for a spot ether ETF - Blockworks


Bitwise filed for a spot ethereum ETF on Thursday. 
The company, which launched a spot bitcoin ETF back in January, also has an ethereum futures ETF, known as the Bitwise Ethereum Strategy ETF (AETH). 
The potential issuer dropped its 19b-4 and S-1 documents side-by-side Thursday, following Fidelity, which filed its S-1 for its proposed fund earlier this week.
Unlike some of its potential competitors, the Bitwise S-1 lacks any language around staking. Ark 21Shares, Fidelity and a few others included such language in earlier filings. 
Read more: Ark 21Shares amends spot ether ETF proposal to include staking language
Bitwise would list the ETF on the NYSE, similarly to its bitcoin ETF. The S-1 didn’t include a ticker or fee. 
The 19b-4 did, however, include a correlation analysis designed to “replicate the specific methodology used by the [Securities and Exchange Commission].”

“We believe the results show strong correlation between the ETH spot market and CME ETH futures market, at a level substantially similar to the findings of the SEC’s analysis in the spot bitcoin ETF approval order,” Bitwise wrote in a post on X.
Read more: Fidelity takes another step toward spot ether ETF, but hurdles likely remain
Hope around a May approval for the proposed ether ETFs has dwindled in the last month, as Bloomberg analysts Eric Balchunas and James Seyffart noted that the SEC has yet to engage with potential issuers. Within a few months of the spot bitcoin ETF approval — which happened in January — the SEC was engaged with issuers to hash out key details.
Grayscale’s Craig Salm said that he doesn’t think the “perceived lack of engagement from regulators should be indicative of one outcome or another.”

“Spot Ethereum ETFs will gather more assets if they launch in December vs. if they launch in May. [Traditional finance] needs more time to digest the bitcoin ETFs,” Matt Hougan, Bitwise’s chief investment officer, said at the Digital Assets Summit earlier this month. 
The SEC has delayed multiple decisions on the spot ETH ETFs, as expected, until late May.

Controversial Taiwanese Singer Raises $39M for Memecoin - DailyCoin


        
Taiwanese celebrity Jeffrey Huang gets $39 million for a new project.



Bobaoppa Memecoin is launching on the Solana blockchain. 



Huang has a history with crypto, including involvement in several ICOs
The memecoin mania on Solana has attracted notable interest, with many of the major tokens surging since their launch. Now, celebrities are rushing into the fray. Most recently, Taiwanese singer Jeffrey Huang has launched his own crypto project, Bobaoppa.However, the project has drawn controversy, as Huang is no stranger to crypto. He was involved in multiple initial coin offerings (ICOs), which saw varied results. Moreover, he was recently threatened with legal action against an investigator who looked into his past crypto ventures. Closer Look at Jeffrey Huang’s Bobaoppa MemecoinTaiwanese singer Jeffrey Huang, alias “Machi Big Brother,” has recently unveiled his new project, the Solana-based Bobaoppa memecoin. According to Solscan, by Thursday, March 28, he managed to raise approximately 213,000 SOL, translating to around $39.5 million. However, as Jeffrey Huang’s involvement in the crypto space is not new, concerns arose. He has been linked to several initial coin offerings (ICOs), including Mithril, Formosa, Machi X, Cream Finance, and Mith Cash, with varied success. These projects, highlighted by crypto investigator ZachXBT in 2022, have faced scrutiny for their management and outcomes. Allegations from the crypto investigator ranged from poor governance to financial impropriety. The concerns raised by ZachXBT led to a public and legal confrontation, culminating in Huang initiating and then withdrawing a defamation lawsuit. In turn, ZachXBT amended certain sections of the accusatory article.Huang’s Past Crypto VenturesZachXBT’s article still paints a worrying picture of Huang’s crypto ventures despite the amendments. The central accusation against Huang involves mismanagement of the projects he’s been associated with. This includes the rapid depletion of funds raised from ICOs, questionable financial transactions, and the abrupt abandonment of projects.
For instance, ZachXBT claims that Formosa Financial saw two large withdrawals totaling 22,000 ETH each shortly after raising funds. A recurring theme in ZachXBT’s investigations is the sudden abandonment of projects. Projects like Swag Finance and Mith Cash experienced rapid growth and a sharp decline, leading to their abandonment.
ZachXBT has also made allegations of insider benefits and unrealistic promises to investors. He claims that Investors were sold on the premise of fast-track listings on top-tier cryptocurrency exchanges, which frequently did not materialize. On the Flipside
Huang is far from the only celebrity promoting questionable crypto projects. Notably, Logan Paul has launched and promoted several failed crypto ventures, most recently CryptoZoo. 



In March 2023, celebrities Linsday Logan, Jake Paul, and others were fined $400,000 by US regulators for promoting Tron. 
Why This MattersCelebrity endorsements in crypto have been mired in controversies. For that reason, investors should be careful before jumping on the celebrity-led hype. Read more about Logan Paul’s failed crypto venture CryptoZoo: Logan Paul Counters CryptoZoo Scam Claims in New DocumentaryRead more about one of the emerging apps on the Solana’s ecosystem: Can Solana’s Decaf App Bring the Unbanked to Crypto?

With Dogecoin breaking out to new highs ahead of the end of the quarter, bullish bets are rising.One Dogecoin trader tweeted on X that DOGE could hit $1 as soon as next quarter.The trader cited a technical analysis of DOGE’s long-term price action history.Indeed, Dogecoin appears to have repeated a pattern formed in 2017-2020 ahead of a huge higher price run.Integration into an X payments system could be the catalyst for this next run higher.If Dogecoin can hit $1, that would mark a rally nearly 5x higher than the current level.While those are impressive gains, many investors would prefer much higher upside potential when entering the highly risky meme coin markets.Unsurprisingly, some Dogecoin community members are targeting a new green AI ICO called eTukTuk as they search for gains in excess of 100x in 2024.New Green AI ICO With 100x Gains Potential in 2024 – eTukTuk ($TUK)
Analysts at Cryptonews keep a close eye on new and up-and-coming ICOs.One such coin they think has at least 100x gain potential in 2024 is an exciting new green AI ICO called eTukTuk.eTukTuk is a new eco-friendly DePIN crypto project that seeks to accelerate the adoption of electric TukTuks in emerging countries.Investors have been piling into the green crypto’s $TUK token ICO. The transportation-focused web3 start-up has now raised over $2.5 million.Each new stage of the eTukTuk presale brings an incremental price increase of 3%, baking in pre-listing gains for early backers (up to a total of 31% across the presale).Potential investors are advised to move quickly, as the next price rise is fast approaching when eTukTuk hits $2.679 million.Visit eTukTuk HereHere’s How eTukTuk Will Change Urban Transport in Developing Nations
Given how small and cheap they run, tuk-tuks are a key mode of transport for developing nations.Tuk-tuks are notorious for their high levels of pollution, however.For example, a tiny tuk-tuk typically has higher CO2 emissions than a conventional automobile.This hurts city residents in developing countries like Sri Lanka and contributes to global warming.“270 million internal combustion engine (ICE) Tuk-Tuks and other two- and three-wheeler vehicles are having a detrimental impact on developing nations across the globe,” points out the eTukTuk white paper.eTukTuk will manufacture and distribute its own newly developed electric tuk-tuk.But the startup isn’t just replacing traditional tuk-tuks with electric variants.It’s also redefining urban mobility with a slew of AI and blockchain solutions:
AI-Driven Efficiency: The $TUK token will fuel AI advancements to optimize routes, reduce traffic congestion, and reduce fuel consumption.
Eco-Friendly Innovations: $TUK aligns token presale efforts with environmental goals, supporting green transportation research.
Smart Infrastructure: $TUK tokens will lead intelligent transport systems through AI-enhanced blockchain technology.
Predictive Maintenance: AI integration in eTukTuks will allow timely maintenance, prolong vehicle life, and ensure reliability.

$TUK will be the native currency across breakout crypto eTukTuk’s EV ecosystem and blockchain.The token will be used for rides, charging, payments to drivers and territory partners, and staking rewards.The token design incentivizes participation and growth of the network.eTukTuk is also introducing a play-to-earn game that will let players drive virtual tuk-tuks through cities in Sri Lanka to pick up customers and earn $TUK token rewards.This gamification will further expand the $TUK token’s utility.Early presale investors also get the option to stake their newly acquired tokens for yields as high as 102%.For instance, a $10,000 USD investment in $TUK tokens during the presale would fetch over 380,000 tokens. Staking those tokens would earn holders nearly $1,000 per month in passive income at current APY!So, not only is $TUK one of web3’s most promising green AI cryptos, but it’s also a secret passive income gem.Crypto Experts Are Accumulating Green AI Crypto $TUK
Popular British presale analyst Jacob Crypto Bury thinks that, with its strong green AI credentials, $TUK has the prospect of posting at least 10x gains versus its presale price when it launches across exchanges later in the year.VIDEOMichael Wrubel is also bullish on $TUK, which he thinks could be the future of electric transportation.VIDEOClinix Crypto thinks $TUK has a lot of long-term potential as well.VIDEOWith strong tokenomics and near-term income potential through staking, the $TUK presale offers a way to gain exposure to eTukTuk early on while the project is still taking shape.eTukTuk’s token presale could be one of 2024’s best.$TUK is a BEP-20 standard token on the Binance Smart Chain network, with a total supply capped at 2 billion tokens.Get TUK Here

Solana's high throughput puts pressure on Ethereum's leading position | Cryptopolitan

Against the background of an Evolving Digital vista, where Blockchain technology redefines the limits in finance and technology, the rivalry between Ethereum (ETH) and Solana (SOL) has warranted much attention from industry experts and enthusiasts. This fiercely competitive environment and the analyst’s forecast imply that someday Solana might outnumber Ethereum’s market share for hosting the decentralized applications.Ethereum’s Blockchain was the undisputed leader in the field, but now the emerging Solana aspires to make a name for itself and prove its worth. For a long time, Ethereum has been the most instrumental and prime crypto asset, which forms the basis of decentralized apps and smart contracts, providing an active development community and growing adoption rate. Although scalability issues have opened doors for some competitors, such as Solana, which is famous for its outstanding high throughput and reduced transaction costs, the solution remains.Analysts characterized Solana as “the new Ethereum” and uttered high the possible power of Solana to lead the blockchain world through his achievements in the past.Though the Solana system is quite similar to Ethereum’s in terms of how blocks are loaded, the blocks of Solana can fill up at a speed nearly as high as Ethereum’s despite their much bigger size.The fact that such success comes when a growing need for use in DeFi and other applications acts as rock-solid proof of the platform’s growing popularity. The challenge Solana faces is the same that Ethereum has had in the past: the growing trend of being compared to Solana due to its achievements and the challenge of staying in power amidst the growing competition.Beyond speed, Ethereum and Solana redefine technology’s coreThe Battle of Blockchains: In conclusion, comparing local folktales with fairytales across cultures shows the universality of folklore as they take on different forms.The debate between Solana and Ethereum is not merely about transaction speed or costs; it touches upon the core of what blockchain technology aims to achieve: soccer, however, features individual skills, teamwork, and mental and physical strength. Besides, it stimulated the improvement of Ethereum’s scalability and energy efficiency, which was of great essence with the shift in processing mechanisms through the Ethereum 2.0 upgrade.Similarly, its novel approach of Proof-of-History, which was implemented with the PoS consensus mechanism, addresses the blockchain trilemma by having outstanding transaction throughput without harming the security and decentralization of the ecosystem.This competition urges both platforms to jump-jacked and create fresh products and services that extend the limits of blockchain technology. With each platform improving technical capabilities, weighing the choices often comes through whether some developer(s) and user(s) need more speed and lower cost or higher robustness, the quality of the ecosystem, and the level of security.Why are Ethereum and Solana at the tip of the Blockchain evolution iceberg?While predictions about Solana surpassing Ethereum are speculative, they underscore an important trend in the blockchain sector: the time-varying environment and interchange of platforms is where no player takes a long-term dominant position. The activities of Ethereum and Solana are carried out fairly strongly, and the process allows new firms to enter the industry, creating a healthy environment for innovation.The effect of Solana and Ethereum on the entirety of the crypto world shall be determined by various factors like technological growth, network support, and the ability to build up the app ecosystem.In the development of the blockchain industry, brands will differ from each other and move to interoperability and integration in different industries with different platforms specialized in different kinds of businesses.The remark that Solana poses a threat to Ethereum concerning its adoption rate illustrates that the field of blockchain is developing quickly.Even though Ethereum and Solana have been competing for the top spot in blockchain technology, their rivalry has improved digital currencies’ technological growth and efficiency. Thus, users, in turn, have more options to choose from. As the sector changes constantly, both platforms will surely remain at the forefront of the application of DLT and decentralized finance.

Sam Bankman-Fried's prison sentence draws criticism as too light

Sam Bankman-Fried, the disgraced cryptocurrency executive who was convicted of fraud in the spectacular collapse of the crypto exchange FTX, was sentenced to 25 years in prison on Thursday.Why Amazon stock gains are changing employee compensationBesides the prison sentence, Judge Lewis Kaplan also ordered a forfeiture of $11.2 billion in assets.Here’s what people are saying about the sentence.U.S. Attorney Damian Williams“Sam Bankman-Fried perpetrated one of the biggest financial frauds in American history — a multibillion-dollar scheme designed to make him the King of Crypto – but while the cryptocurrency industry might be new and the players like Sam Bankman-Fried might be new, this kind of corruption is as old as time,” U.S. Attorney Damiana Williams said in a statement.He added: “This case has always been about lying, cheating, and stealing, and we have no patience for it.” Sam Bankman-Fried“A lot of people feel really let down, and they were very let down, and I am sorry about that,” Bankman-Fried said before he was sentenced. “I am sorry about what happened at every stage. And there are things I should’ve done and things I shouldn’t have.”“My useful life is probably over,” he added. “It’s been over for a while now.”Kathleen Breitman, co-founder of Tezos“Sam’s performance solidified my belief that he’s unlikely to be rehabilitated by any measures the state can perform to punish him,” Kathleen Breitman, co-founder of the blockchain network Tezos, said in an email.She called the sentence inadequate for the scope and extent of his crimes.“At the end of the day, SBF was a political animal trying to influence U.S. regulators to create a moat around FTX,” Breitman said.“The best hope for some sort of justice, at this point, might be for the people SBF was trying to influence — through media campaigns, lobbying, and political donations — to reflect on creating guidance that will be resilient against the next awkwardly charming entrepreneur they meet,” she added.Terrence Yang, managing director at Swan Bitcoin“Twenty-five years is too light,” said Terrence Yang, managing director of the Bitcoin financial services firm Swan Bitcoin. “What Kaplan is missing is the victim statements from at least three people who committed suicide as a result of SBF’s crimes. This doesn’t count his perjury, lying on the stand and evasiveness.”“Justice is not served,” he added. “The damage SBF did was permanent and severe. He ruined a lot of families and lives with his felonious acts and put salt in the deep wounds with his total lack of remorse.”And Yang dismissed how Bankman-Fried’s lawyers cited his health in arguing for leniency.“I get that he has ADHD & ADHD families filed a statement with the court asking for leniency, but SBF is the only person with ADHD in the world who stole billions of dollars in customer funds and destroyed or hurt millions of lives,” he said. “Not just financially, but emotionally and spiritually.”Moe Vela, former senior adviser to President Joe Biden Moe Vela, a senior adviser to tech startup Unicoin and former senior adviser to President Biden, downplayed connections between Bankman-Fried and the Biden administration. Bankman-Fried was emerging as an increasingly influential Democratic donor at the time of FTX’s collapse.“I am very well aware of SBF’s donations to Democrats and I am hopeful most or all of them will return those donations or donate them to charity if they have not already,” Vela said.“In my many years of involvement on the national level in politics and elections, it is a story as old as time that candidates in BOTH parties receive political contributions from someone who one day becomes a criminal,” he added. “Ironically, [Donald] Trump’s contributors are contributing to a candidate who has been indicted over 90 times. We shall see if they all become contributors to a convicted criminal in the near future.”Sam Bankman-Fried’s parents“We are heartbroken and will continue to fight for our son,” Joe Bankman and Barbara Fried said in a statement after leaving the courtroom.

KuCoin launches US$10 mln airdrop campaign amid legal woes


Cryptocurrency exchange KuCoin has announced a US$10 million airdrop for its users, featuring Bitcoin and its native KuCoin Token (KCS), amidst allegations of illegal operations and money laundering.
The platform claims that the initiative is intended as a token of gratitude to the platform’s users during a tumultuous phase of legal challenges. 
The U.S. Department of Justice charged KuCoin and its two founders with running an unlicensed money transmission business and breaching anti-money laundering statutes earlier this week. 
According to the DOJ, founders Chun Gan and Ke Tang face a maximum sentence of five years in prison for each charge.



Meanwhile, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission has accused the exchange of unauthorized commodity transactions. 
Since the charges became public, KuCoin told investors that the exchange will continue its operation and that customer assets are safe.
KuCoin’s legal predicaments come as major cryptocurrency exchanges, including Coinbase and Binance, face legal issues of their own.
On Thursday, Sam Bankman-Fried was sentenced to 25 years in prison for fraud charges related to the FTX collapse.

Binance executives launch legal battle against Nigerian authorities

Nigeria, high position officials of Binance, the global cryptocurrency exchange, are facing a court case with the security forces in the country. Tigran Gambaryan, the detained Binance executive, and Nadeem Anjarwalla, the African manager of the company, have both brought lawsuits against the National Security Adviser (NSA) Nigeria and the Economic Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC), which accuse these institutions of violating their fundamental human rights.Binance executives sue Nigerian authorities over the detentionGambaryan’s detention and following the suit he then made against Nuhu Ribadu, the EFCC’s Director, was taken through the Aluko and Oyebode Law Firm Law Firm. A U.S. citizen who holds a financial crime compliance role with Binance and has been detained, and his passport was also taken, is the executive. He says that his arrest and passport confiscation violated the Nigerian Constitution, and thus, he was denied his right to freedom and liberty.Mirroring this, Jok Katua, through an escape from the prison on the 22nd of March, filed the second petition, which compelled the court to respect his rights. In the end, through a divergent trajectory from the detention, both executives are pointing out the actions of the ONSA and EFCC, which are factors for the increasing divide between the Nigerian authorities and the cryptocurrency giant.Gambaryan asks for several things, including release from custody, the back of his passport, a restraining order that will not allow further detention over to Binance trivia investigations, and a public apology and compensation for legal costs in his petition. He lays out his argument by pinpointing that his detention has ensued merely because Binance, in turn, refused to provide information to the Nigerian government, which acted within legal boundaries during his visit to the country.The initial proceedings for the opposing side’s case fell through because lawyers did not represent them. The next court sessions have, therefore, been set for April 8th. Consequently, people feel low self-esteem, and the dependency is reinforced. Consequently, the individuals involved affect legal representation and due process issues.Tax evasion allegationsNot only this but up next, looming in the wings are the much-anticipated tax avoidance charges that the Abuja federal court is expected to hear. Allegations against Binance and its executives include that they have not been registered with the local regulatory bodies, that they have evaded tax liabilities, that they care for their clients who would like to evade the tax, and that they have not been compliant with the Value Added Tax invoicing and deduction requirements. These levies tend to crystalize the theoretical perception of the governance matter that crypto traders in Nigeria are facing from the state, thus keeping up with the policy trends. The recent legal battles between the citizens of Binance and Nigerian authorities regarding cryptocurrency in the country determine the sector’s future. The considered cases would highlight the complicated problems of the certification and functioning of transnational platforms in a jurisdiction where the legal and tax scene is undergoing a turning point. Impact on Global Crypto Compliance StrategiesFilippo Lancieri, the head of the legal team at Binance, the first global cryptocurrency trading platform, explained that the result of these legal battles will shape the tactics that crypto companies will use worldwide to achieve compliance and government engagement in emerging markets.On the other hand, the issue evokes significant demands regarding the relationship between the growth of financial technology and the need to satisfy legal procedures and tax obligations. Amidst the proceedings, cryptocurrency entities, legal professionals on the global level, and regulators worldwide will be closely trying to grasp the future of cryptocurrency regulation and the way to defend the fundamental rights available in the fast-growing cryptocurrency industry.

                        U.S. Attorney Damian Williams wrote in an official statement following Judge Lewis A. Kaplan’s Thursday morning ruling that FTX founder Sam Bankman-Fried’s 25-year prison sentence will send “an important message” to potential fraudsters everywhere.In addition to a quarter of a century in prison, Kaplan has ordered Bankman-Fried to forfeit over $11 billion.A Message To Future Fraudsters, U.S. Attorney Says
Bankman-Fried’s sentencing follows his November 2023 trial for his nearly $8 billion digital asset fraud scheme through crypto exchange FTX and its sister company, Alameda Research, with Williams calling the FTX founder’s theft “unprecedented.”“Today’s sentence will prevent the defendant from ever again committing fraud and is an important message to others who might be tempted to engage in financial crimes that justice will be swift, and the consequences will be severe,” Williams said.Sam Bankman-Fried Apologizes
Slightly thinner and wearing a beige jumpsuit, Bankman-Fried spoke in court during the ruling, apologizing to colleagues, family, friends, and customers for the crypto exchange’s collapse.“I know a lot of people feel let down,” Bankman-Fried told the court. “I’m sorry about that. I’m sorry about everything that happened at every stage.”He went on to state that he feels “excruciating guilt” over his role in the crypto exchange’s implosion, claiming the damage it caused “haunts” him every day.The FTX founder’s new lawyer, Marc Muskasey, likened the fraudster to a “beautiful puzzle” who was “socially awkward.”“SBF doesn’t make decisions with malice in his heart,” Mukasey said. “He makes decisions with math in his head.”SBF Motivated By Power And Influence, U.S. Attorney Says
Kaplan, however, did not subscribe to the defense’s logic, calling their argument “misleading, logically flawed, and speculative.”“He knew it was wrong,” Kaplan continued. “He knew it was criminal. He regrets making a bad bet against the likelihood of getting caught – and he’s not going to admit a thing.”“His deliberate and ongoing lies demonstrated a brazen disregard for customers’ expectations and disrespect for the rule of law, all so that he could secretly use his customers’ money to expand his own power and influence,” Williams continued. “The scale of his crimes is measured not just by the amount of money that was stolen, but by the extraordinary harm caused to victims, who in some cases had their life savings wiped out overnight.”Bankman-Fried will spend his sentence in a medium-security prison.  He is currently at the Metropolitan Detention Center in Brooklyn, NY.

These AI Tokens Are All Up Over 30% This Week Amid Plans to Merge - Decrypt

A day after a merger announcement, AI tokens connected to Fetch.AI, SingularityNET, and Ocean Protocol are up 30% for the week, according to CoinGecko.On Wednesday, the three projects announced plans to combine into a single entity. If approved by their respective communities, the merger would effectively create a massive decentralized AI ecosystem called the Superintelligence Alliance.A day after news of the merger broke, Fetch.AI’s FET token is $3.41, up 33%, SingularityNET’s AGIX is $1.43, up 36.2%, and Ocean Protocol’s OCEAN is $1.50, up 32.5%.The news of the merger comes as generative AI becomes more ubiquitous, and AI hallucinations continue to be a problem in the industry. In December, Fetch.AI and SingularityNET announced a partnership to curb the problem.According to Fetch.AI, the alliance will bring together Fetch.AI’s autonomous AI agents and blockchain infrastructure, SingularityNET’s research and development, and Ocean Protocol’s data sharing and monetization.While AI tokens have been on the market for many years, the rise of OpenAI’s ChatGPT and Anthropic’s Claude AI has seen new interest in artificial intelligence-themed cryptocurrencies.On Tuesday, other AI tokens surged after news that the IOTA Foundation—the group supporting the Internet of Things Application (IOTA) cryptocurrency—will launch a $10 million investment fund at this year's Investopia event in Abu Dhabi. Launched in 2016, IOTA is currently $0.35, up 11.2% for the week.On Thursday, SingularityNET invited its community members to vote on the proposed Superintelligence Alliance.“We are excited to invite AGIX token holders on the Ethereum and Cardano networks to participate in a community governance vote about the formation of the Artificial Superintelligence Alliance,” SingularityNET said on Twitter, adding that the vote would run from April 2nd to April 16th. “Your participation is crucial in shaping the future of decentralized AI!”“It is imperative, as the AI revolution intensifies, to ensure that AGI and ASI as they develop are not owned and controlled by any particular party with its biased interests. They should be rolled out in an open, democratic, and decentralized way,” SingularityNET founder and CEO Dr. Ben Goertzel said in a statement.“This has been the joint vision of SingularityNET, Fetch.AI, and Ocean Protocol from their inception,” Goertzel continued. “For this reason, it makes total sense that our three projects come together to form a tokenomic network that has greater power to take on Big Tech and shift the center of gravity of the AI world into the decentralized ecosystem.”Edited by Ryan Ozawa.Stay on top of crypto news, get daily updates in your inbox.

In five transactions, SHIB Army members have incinerated an equivalent of $1,786.Shiba Inu witnessed a price milestone two days ago, scorching past the $0.00003 key resistance level. Inclined to repeat the monthly high of $0.000044, SHIB’s way up highly depends on the burning rate and the intricate developments within Shibarium’s Ecosystem.A few days back, Shiba Inu’s Shibarium Layer-2 public blockchain soared to a new all-time high of $3.8M in Shibarium’s total value locked (TVL). Ultimately, this solidifies the chain’s liquidity, which tripled after onboarding WoofSwap DEX. The dApp contributed $2.34 million to Shibarium’s TVL upon launch on March 22, 2024.Shiba Inu Custodians Calculate Next SHIB Price TargetFollowing the 200% monthly surge for SHIB, veteran crypto chart analyst SHIB Knight shared a diagram that measured Shiba Inu’s price growth potential if the canine coin sustains above $0.00003 on the daily close. If the aforementioned resistance level acts as support, Shiba Inu’s boost up to $0.000034 is on the cards, according to SHIB Knight.Many SHIB investors expect to see a bull rally topping SHIB’s all-time high. SHIB’s technical pattern currently suggests a 63% distance from its all-time high of $0.00008616, recorded on October 28, 2021.While other popular canine coins like Dogwifhat (WIF) and Bonk (BONK) recently hit new heights, Shiba Inu’s upward trajectory is tested by a strong resistance wall due to the piling sell pressure.
According to the combined liquidity book on Spot markets, SHIB’s spending sells outweigh the bids by $18 million despite increased demand. Shiba Inu is currently exchanging hands at $0.0000321, according to the independent price aggregator CoinGecko.On the Flipside
An automated Shiba Inu (SHIB) burning system will be installed on SHIB’s Layer-2 scaling solution, Shibarium.



Currently only launched on Shibarium’s ‘Puppynet’ testnet, this mechanism is set to speed up SHIB notably burns.

Shiba Inu Lead Dev Tells Ethereum Founder, ‘It’s Just The Start’, Here’s Why | Bitcoinist.com


								Shiba Inu (SHIB) lead developer, Shytoshi Kusama, recently told Ethereum’s co-founder Vitalik Buterin that he should expect more improvement from the SHIB ecosystem soon. This comes in response to Vitalik’s comment in which he praised the meme coin. 
More To Come From SHIB
Kusama responded to Vitalik in an X (formerly Twitter) post, in which he shared a GIF that read, “… it’s just the start.” The developer was reacting to Vitalik’s comment that SHIB has “massively outperformed” his expectations. Vitalik had specifically donated SHIB to the Future of Life Institute (FLI) and looked to be impressed with how fast the transaction was processed. 

However, Kusama’s response is a bold statement to the crypto community about how SHIB has yet to reach its full potential and that more growth should be expected from the crypto token and its ecosystem. Meanwhile, Kusama wasn’t the only member of the Shiba Inu team that reacted to Vitalik’s statement. 
Shiba Inu’s Marketing Lead, Lucie, stated that Vitalik’s praise for SHIB is a great reminder not to underestimate the meme coin and its community. She also used the opportunity to urge members of the SHIB community to utilize the layer-2 network Shibarium so that everyone in the crypto space can see how strong the community is. 
Indeed, the SHIB community, commonly referred to as the ‘SHIB Army,’ has played an integral role in helping SHIB experience such exponential growth since it launched in 2020. In his response to Vitalik, Kusama also reaffirmed this fact by using the hashtag ‘#SHIBARMYSTRONG’ in his post. 
What To Expect From The Shiba Inu Ecosystem
Last year, Shiba Inu revealed plans to acquire a Top-Level Domain (TLD). This forms part of the Shiba Inu team’s plan to use the crypto token to bridge the gap between the Web3 and Web2 space. Back then, Shiba Inu’s partner, D3Inc, noted that this move would be a game-changer as the proposed ‘.shib’ TLD would natively support Web2 and Web3 tools. 

Shiba Inu developer Kaal Dhairya added that this was part of their aim to decentralize the internet and make SHIB the “operating system of the future internet.” Interestingly, this move is part of a long list of plans the team had outlined at the beginning of the year, which they planned to accomplish. 
Although ambitious, the community also launched a petition in February for Grayscale to consider offering a Shiba Inu ETF. 
At the time of writing, SHIB is trading at around $0.00003122, up almost 5% in the last 24 hours according to data from CoinMarketCap.

Bitcoin Becomes Preferred Asset for Diversification Among Fund Managers ⋆ ZyCrypto

&nbsp

&nbsp
In the mainstream space, one asset has been steadily gaining traction among fund managers worldwide: Bitcoin. Recognized for its potential to diversify portfolios and offer unique opportunities, Bitcoin is increasingly becoming the go-to asset for strategic allocation.



The Report from QCP Capital



A recent report from QCP Capital sheds light on this growing trend, suggesting that fund managers are adding Bitcoin to their clients’ portfolios for more diversification. Beyond adding Bitcoin to their investment mix, fund managers are exploring structured products such as Accumulators and FCNs, indicating a strong desire to incorporate Bitcoin into traditional investment strategies.



What’s particularly interesting is the rise in requests for spot BTC ETFs, as noted by wealth desks at major banks. This demand from clients shows a significant shift in investor opinion towards Bitcoin, with more institutional and retail investors recognizing its value proposition.



Increased Institutional Demand



Bitcoin’s recent price surge of over $70,000 has created more hype around the asset. The London Stock Exchange has revealed its plans to introduce Exchange-Traded Notes (ETNs) for Bitcoin and Ethereum in May. This event adds even more fuel to the fire and may contribute to Bitcoin’s bullish momentum.



Despite the volatility of the crypto market, fund managers remain bullish on Bitcoin. QCP Capital predicts Bitcoin to maintain its trajectory, with the potential to surpass the $100,000 level in the near future. Since Bitcoin offers better returns than traditional assets, it becomes an attractive option for investors looking to diversify.

&nbsp



Fund managers are experimenting with various strategies to profit from Bitcoin. Leveraging the heightened BTC Spot-Forward Basis might be a viable option in the market. Additionally, launching Accumulators allows participants to buy Bitcoin at a lower price, leaving more room for profits.



Bitcoin – Becoming a Mainstream Asset



The upcoming debut of Bitcoin and Ethereum ETNs on the London Stock Exchange marks a significant moment for the mainstream adoption of crypto. While these ETNs will be limited to professional investors due to regulatory constraints, their introduction highlights the growing acceptance of crypto in the mainstream markets.



Bitcoin’s rise as the preferred asset for diversification among fund managers reflects a major shift in the investing space. With its ability to offer better diversification and higher potential returns independent of traditional assets, Bitcoin continues to solidify its position as a strategic allocation in investment portfolios worldwide.

Shiba Inu Going To $0.0001: Crypto Analyst Reveals What Will Drive The Rally


                            Shiba Inu has gone on various price spikes in the past few months amidst a surge in activity and interest in the meme coin. This price movement has prompted traders and analysts to ponder on when SHIB can reach the much coveted $0.0001 mark, a price level which it has largely failed to reach despite the impressive price action. 
Micheal_EWPro, a crypto analyst, posted an analysis on when SHIB could potentially reach the $0.0001 price level. According to him, the current dynamics could push SHIB above $0.0001 in June. Interestingly, his price prediction is based on the Elliott Wave Theory.
Analyst Reveals SHIB Is Going To $0.0001
According to the SHIB chart shared by Michael on the 3-day candlestick formation, the meme coin’s price formation since 2022 has largely followed the Elliott Wave count. The Elliot Wave Theory is basically a technical analysis method that analyses price movement traditionally in terms of a 5-wave move in the direction of the larger trend and a 3-wave correction in the opposite trend.

Each of these Elliott Wave can be further subdivided into various patterns of smaller degree impulses based on their formations. However, all the subdivisions add up to one larger wave impulse.
Using this knowledge of Elliot Wave Theory, the analyst noted that SHIB has started the formation of the third of five larger degree waves since October 2023 albeit with smaller degree impulses which he labelled as i, ii, iii, iv, and v. Traditionally, the third Elliot Wave is usually the largest and most powerful wave in a trend where most of the price action takes place. As a result, his analysis points to the third wave ending at a price just above $0.0001 in the first week of June.
The analyst did implore a take-profit at $0.00008854 and a final price target of $0.00010191, while also noting that the bulls still have some work to do before this price point can come to a reality. 

What’s Next For Shiba Inu?
Shiba Inu has reversed since reaching $0.00004456 and has majorly traded between $0.000030 and $0.0000275 since the beginning of the week. However, analysts and SHIB enthusiasts remain positive, especially with SHIB securing a listing on an Australian-based crypto exchange.

This positive sentiment recently pushed SHIB to second place in crypto searches. At the same time, Shiba Inu’s layer-2 platform, Shibarium, has seen its TVL surging to a new high of $3.9 million.
At the time of writing, SHIB is trading at $0.00003097, up by 14% in the past seven days.

SBF’s ambitions went too far, judge says when handing down 25-year sentence - Blockworks


In his parting words to FTX founder Sam Bankman-Fried on Thursday, the judge overseeing his criminal case said the former darling of the cryptocurrency industry, although “exceptionally ambitious,” was ultimately a reckless gambler. 
Bankman-Fried is “a man willing to flip a coin as to the continued existence of life and civilization on Earth if the chances were imperceptibly greater that it would come out without that catastrophic outcome,” Judge Lewis Kaplan said during Bankman-Fried’s sentencing hearing.  
Kaplan ordered Bankman-Fried to 25 years in prison, a sentence that falls between the defense’s requested 6.5 years and the government’s proposed 40 to 50 years. Bankman-Fried was also ordered to pay a $11 billion forfeiture. 
Kaplan’s comments followed what may have been Bankman-Fried’s final statement in open court, unless his case moves forward in the appellate process, which his team said they will pursue. 
Read more: Given one more chance to defend himself, SBF blew it 
In a meandering address that lasted 15 minutes, Bankman-Fried hailed his former employees, who he ultimately “failed.” 
“They all built something really beautiful,” Bankman-Fried said. “They threw themselves into it. And then I threw all of that away. It haunts me every day.”
The hearing, which lasted just over two hours, included statements from FTX victim and self-proclaimed “creditor champion” Sunil Kavuri, and Adam Moskowitz, the attorney heading up the FTX class action lawsuit. 
Kavuri used the majority of his time to criticize Sullivan & Cromwell, the firm representing FTX in its bankruptcy proceedings. Victims should be compensated with gains earned on their stolen funds, Kavuri said.

“I appreciate the points you’re making, but I’m here to sentence Mr. Bankman-Fried, not assess what the bankruptcy [estate] should or shouldn’t have done,” Kaplan told Kavuri. 
“I think it would be helpful if you could bring your remarks to a close,” Kaplan added several minutes later after Kavuri once again drifted off topic. 
Kavuri was just one of more than 115 victims that wrote impact statements to the court, making up nearly half of the 1,929 pages of sentence-related submissions to the court.

Moskowitz kept his remarks brief. He told the court that Bankman-Fried “has been very helpful” to the class action team. 
“There should be some consideration for that,” Moskowitz said. “I can’t tell you how much or I can’t tell you what, but I do like the fact that people know if they help the class action find recovery, there may be something in it for them.” 
Bankman-Fried’s parents, Joe Bankman and Barbara Fried, who were present throughout the trial last fall, appeared sullen on Thursday. While the two looked away during much of the hearing and held their heads down when Kaplan handed down the sentence, they watched Bankman-Fried closely as he addressed the court. 
Kaplan requested that Bankman-Fried serve his time in a minimal or medium-security facility, ideally close to San Francisco, CA, so he can be near his family.

Bitwise files with SEC for spot Ether ETF listing

Asset management firm Bitwise has filed with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to list and trade shares of a spot Ether (ETH) exchange-traded fund, or ETF.In a March 28 filing, Bitwise filed a Form S-1 registration statement with the SEC for shares of its Ethereum ETF. The filing came amid speculation that the SEC was seeking to label Ether a security under its regulatory purview, putting future listings of spot ETF ETFs into doubt.Based on a 19b-4 amendment filing with the SEC, Bitwise intends to list shares of the ETH investment vehicle on NYSE Arca.

SEC Case Against Ripple Weakens: Can SEC Prove XRP Caused Harm? - DailyCoin


        
Disgorgement, a key factor in the SEC’s financial attack on Ripple, has faced new legal hurdles.



The SEC may struggle to prove individual investor losses, potentially reducing Ripple’s penalty.



Even if XRP gets deemed a security, the SEC’s ability to financially cripple Ripple has come into question.
The ongoing legal battle between Ripple Labs, the company behind the XRP cryptocurrency, and the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has entered a critical phase. While the core issue of whether XRP is a security remains central, a recent court ruling could significantly impact the SEC’s ability to secure a major victory.SEC’s Disgorgement Case Against Ripple Faces HurdleThe crux of the SEC’s case against Ripple hinges on disgorgement, a legal remedy that forces a party to return allegedly ill-gotten gains. The SEC is seeking a hefty $1.95 billion from Ripple, comprising $876 million in disgorgement, the same in civil penalty, and $200 million in interest. However, a recent court decision has cast doubt on the SEC’s ability to achieve this hefty sum.According to legal experts, a recent ruling established a stricter standard for disgorgement. The SEC is now required to demonstrate concrete financial losses individual investors suffer. The SEC’s argument that some XRP buyers were financially harmed because they bought at a lower price than others might not meet this new standard.Without clear evidence of individual investor losses, the court may find it difficult to justify the sizeable disgorgement amount sought by the SEC. This could drastically reduce the final penalty imposed on Ripple Labs, even if the court rules that XRP is a security.No Clear Investor Harm?The recent ruling weakens the SEC’s case by highlighting the lack of identifiable victims. This further weakens the SEC’s claim of over $200 million in interest, as interest typically accrues on disgorgement amounts.While the SEC could still pursue a financial penalty against Ripple, the absence of clear evidence of investor harm significantly weakens its position. 
This unexpected development adds another layer of complexity to the already intricate legal battle between Ripple and the SEC. The outcome of the case will undoubtedly significantly impact the future of cryptocurrency regulation in the United States.On the Flipside
The SEC may argue that the new disgorgement standard shouldn’t apply in this case, setting a legal precedent for future crypto security offerings.



Even if the SEC fails to secure disgorgement, Ripple could still face a significant civil penalty if the court finds XRP to be a security.
Why This MattersThe SEC’s struggle to prove individual investor losses in Ripple’s XRP sale throws a wrench into their disgorgement strategy, potentially reducing the financial blow to Ripple even if the court deems XRP a security. This sets a potentially stricter precedent for future SEC enforcement actions within the cryptocurrency industry.

BlackRock's tokenized fund registers over $240 million in inflows within a week - Crypto Briefing




BlackRock’s tokenized fund BUIDL (BlackRock USD Institutional Digital Liquidity) has captured over $240 million in deposits since its debut a week ago, as reported by Bloomberg. Each of the funds’ shares is worth $1, and it generates daily accrued dividends to qualified investors by investing in cash, US Treasury bills, and repurchase agreements. The yield is paid in new tokens each month.The BUIDL token is offered by Securitize Markets, an alternative trading system registered under the US Securities and Exchange Commission, and has a broker-dealer license under the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority. This makes it possible for investors to transfer the tokens to other validated addresses.“It’s very institutional, it is managed by the largest asset manager in the world,” said Carlos Domingo, founder and CEOof Securitize, to Bloomberg. “There’s no counterparty risk to any crypto company.”Moreover, crypto startup Ondo Finance has invested a total amount of $95 million in BlackRock’s BUIDL, Ondo’s founder Nathan Allman told Bloomberg.According to real-world asset (RWA) data aggregator RWA.xyz, the BUIDL launch also propelled the total size of the tokenized US Treasuries to almost $1 billion, with a rise of over 35% since BlackRock’s tokenized fund came live.This industry is dominated by the first US-registered tokenized money market fund, Franklin Templeton’s OnChain U.S. Government Money Fund. BENJI, the token representing the shares of Franklin Templeton’s fund, represents over 36% of the tokenized US Treasuries.However, this dominance might shift soon, as BUIDL already represents 24,6% of this market within one week after its launch, and it also offers the possibility of transferring tokenized shares between fund investors.

Ethereum whale cashes out 17,000 ETH - Here's what it means for you - AMBCrypto



An Ethereum whale that has been holding ETH for a long period of time sells its holdings.
Price of ETH remains unaffected, however, activity on Ethereum’s ecosystem poses concerns.

After seeing a massive rally over the last week, the price of Ethereum[ETH] started to get stagnant around the $3500 price level. Due to this stagnancy, many holders decided to indulge in profit-taking.
Whale takes profit
According to recent data, an initial holder of ETH exchanged 17,770 ETH for 62.24 million DAI at a rate of $3,503 per ETH.
This individual amassed 14,280 ETH, valued at approximately $2.6 million, at an average price of only around $182, spanning purchases made from Gemini and Bittrex between March 2017 and April 2021.
With a staggering gain of 23 times their initial investment, the profit amounts to $59 million.
This whale’s sale of 17,770 ETH injects a large amount of the currency into the market. This can cause downward pressure on the price in the short term, especially if there aren’t enough buyers to absorb all the ETH being sold.
However, the overall impact depends on market sentiment. If the sale triggers panic selling, the price could drop further. But, if the market views it as a healthy correction or the whale is simply taking profits, the price could stabilize or even rebound as others see a buying opportunity.
ETH remains resilient
At press time, ETH was trading at $3,571.59,  marking a 27% difference from its all-time high. The price of ETH had tested the $3674.23 levels twice over the last few weeks.
If ETH manages to break past this level, it will put an end to the bearish trend that was observed after its price fell from $4081.55. ETH could also possibly head in the direction of the $4081.55 resistance yet again.
However, the coin’s CMF (Chaikin Money Flow) declined in the last few days, indicating that the money flow for ETH had fallen. This suggests that the price of ETH could see a period of sideways or downward movement before it starts to rally.

State of the Ethereum network
The popularity of the Ethereum ecosystem will also aid ETH positively in the future. The gas usage on the Ethereum network remained consistent over the past month, suggesting a highly active ecosystem.
However, the overall number of NFTs being traded on the network fell significantly over the last few days, indicating that the interest in NFTs on the Ethereum ecosystem fell. This could hurt the activity on the Ethereum network in the long run.

Institutional Investment Shifts Bitcoin Mining Landscape, Challenging Decentralization and Network Dynamics



                    
Institutional investment in Bitcoin mining by large public companies has notably impacted the landscape for individual and small-scale miners, with significant consequences for the network’s dynamics, according to a Bitfinex report on the cryptocurrency mining ecosystem ahead of the Bitcoin halving. 



The study reveals a shift from the decentralized vision of Bitcoin, where individuals contributed to network security, to a scenario dominated by corporate entities. 




These entities prioritize shareholder returns, operating on a much larger scale with different priorities than smaller miners. 



The report emphasizes their focus on profitability and managing investor expectations, often sidelining the community’s more altruistic values such as network security, egalitarian access, and censorship resistance.



The entry of Wall Street funding into Bitcoin mining has professionalized the sector, leading to increased hashing power that could theoretically enhance network security and stability. 



However, concerns arise about centralization and corporate influence, which could diverge from Bitcoin’s original ethos of being open, borderless, and resistant to control by any single entity. 



The Bitfinex analysis notes that the consolidation of mining operations by these large companies could potentially threaten Bitcoin’s decentralized nature, as they are able to scale operations more effectively, secure cheaper energy, and invest in the latest technologies, making it difficult for smaller miners to compete.



The infusion of institutional capital has altered the incentive structure within the network, favoring those who can operate on a large scale.

This shift raises questions about the future of Bitcoin’s decentralized ethos and whether the increased centralization could impact network security and the distribution of mining rewards. 



The survival of independent and hobbyist miners now depends on their ability to innovate and collaborate. 




Mining pools are suggested as a solution, allowing for the pooling of resources to stay competitive. 



Moreover, the sustainability of hobby mining is contingent on the development of more efficient mining technologies and the utilization of renewable energy.



Geographical diversification of mining operations is also highlighted as vital for maintaining the network’s decentralization. 



Emerging markets with renewable or untapped energy sources are seen as promising locations for new mining ventures. 



The report concludes that, while the landscape is evolving, the core community values and decentralized nature of Bitcoin must be preserved to ensure the network’s integrity and resilience.

Hedge Fund Goes Long Bitcoin, Short MicroStrategy: Details


								Kerrisdale Capital, a hedge fund, today disclosed a nuanced investment thesis: going long on Bitcoin while concurrently taking a short position on MicroStrategy shares. This move is predicated on the assessment that MicroStrategy, which has positioned itself as a de facto Bitcoin investment vehicle, is trading at a significantly unjustified premium to the underlying cryptocurrency that primarily constitutes its value.
Long Bitcoin, Short MSTR
The hedge fund’s analysis articulates, “Shares of MicroStrategy have soared amid a recent rise in the price of Bitcoin but, as is often the case with crypto, things have gotten carried away.” Kerrisdale highlights a critical discrepancy, noting that MicroStrategy’s stock price implies a BTC value of “over $177k, i.e., two and a half times the spot price of Bitcoin.”

Delving into the reasoning behind the premium on MicroStrategy’s shares, Kerrisdale debunks several arguments that have been made in favor of the company’s market valuation. The report categorically states, “None of the reasons commonly provided for MicroStrategy’s relative attractiveness justify paying well over double for the same coin.” This statement underscores the hedge fund’s stance on the overvaluation of MicroStrategy in relation to direct BTC exposure.
MicroStrategy, under CEO Michael Saylor’s leadership since 1989, has aggressively pursued BTC accumulation, making it a central pillar of its investment strategy. From August 2020 to 2023, the company made significant financial maneuvers to increase its holdings, which now exceed 214,000 BTC.
Kerrisdale’s valuation approach considers MicroStrategy’s enterprise software business and its BTC reserves. The analysis concludes that the software business, while still operational, “no longer contributes meaningful value to the overall enterprise,” spotlighting the overwhelming influence of Bitcoin on the company’s valuation.
A key aspect of Kerrisdale’s critique focuses on the inflated premium over Net Asset Value (NAV) attributed to MicroStrategy’s shares. “At 2.6x, MicroStrategy’s equity premium is exceptionally high,” the report states, suggesting an unsustainable market position relative to historical data. Kerrisdale argues that a correction towards a more historically consistent premium would imply a substantial downside for MicroStrategy’s stock relative to Bitcoin’s performance.

The report thoroughly examines the potential implications of MicroStrategy’s financial strategy, including its reliance on leverage and the dilutive effects of its financing mechanisms. Kerrisdale’s analysis suggests that while MicroStrategy’s aggressive capital market activities have succeeded in increasing its Bitcoin holdings, they have simultaneously led to a stagnation in the amount of Bitcoin per share, due to the dilutive impact of debt financing and equity offerings.
Concluding, Kerrisdale Capital estimates that “assuming the current premium of 2.6x contracts to a more historically consistent 1.3x represents 50% downside in MSTR relative to bitcoin.” This conclusion is drawn from an examination of the interplay between MicroStrategy’s stock premium, its Bitcoin holdings, and the broader market dynamics.
The reactions from the community were rather critical. Bit Paine (@BitPaine) commented, “Are you selling advance tickets to your funeral?”. Another crypto analyst, Trey Sellers (@ts_hodl), stated, “Seems like a logical position to me, although markets can remain irrational longer than you can stay solvent, as they say.”
OSF (@osf_rekt) added, “There is probably nothing more dumb than publishing your mid-curve trade idea to an army of irrational degens who will make it their life mission to liquidate you.”
At press time, BTC traded at $71,519.

BlackRock's BTC AUM Challenges Grayscale with 250K Milestone - DailyCoin


        
Blackrock’s BTC ETF takes the lead as issuers’ assets under management soar.



The firm’s CEO has lauded the growth of Bitcoin ETFs since its launch.



Bitcoin ETFs currently hold a significant percentage of the entire BTC market supply.
Following the SEC’s regulatory nod on January 11, 2024, the launch of Bitcoin ETFs got off to a great start, taking the financial world by storm and outperforming traditional commodities with unprecedented milestones. Leading the charge is BlackRock, which has experienced remarkable growth along with the other nine issuers, marked by surging daily inflows and a growing BTC supply stash.Further solidifying its position, the leading asset management firm has hit a new milestone.BlackRock’s Bitcoin Stash Hits ATHOn Thursday, March 28, BlackRock’s IBIT’s assets under management (AUM) reached a new all-time high, exceeding 250,000 BTC, valued at approximately $17.6 billion.This marks BlackRock’s position as the second largest Bitcoin issuer by AUM, surpassed by Grayscale, which currently holds a stash of 347,552 BTC. However, the growing momentum of BlackRock’s IBIT since its launch suggests a likely imminent overthrow of Grayscale, particularly considering the latter’s contrasting underperformance.Commenting on IBIT’s monumental performance, BlackRock CEO Larry Fink echoed the prevailing market sentiment surrounding Bitcoin ETFs. In an interview with Fox Business on Wednesday, Fink asserted that the newly listed investment vehicle “is the fastest-growing ETF in the history of ETFs.” The CEO’s comments and surging AUM align with the growing daily inflows across the asset class, underscoring the tremendous success of Bitcoin ETFs.Bitcoin ETFs Monster PerformanceThe explosive launch of Bitcoin ETFs has propelled the asset class to the forefront of investment options, introducing a major shift to exchange-traded funds and shattering long-standing records.
Building on the momentum, the “newborn nine” ETFs crossed a historic milestone on March 8, collectively holding nearly 4% of the supply of the largest crypto asset by market cap at over $54 billion.
Trailing behind BlackRock is Fidelity’s WiseOrigin Bitcoin ETF (FBTC), which boasts a total of $9.87 billion at press time. ARK 21Shares Bitcoin ETF (ARKB) follows closely with over $3 billion, fueled by its recent record daily inflow value of $200 million.Issuers, including Bitwise’s BITB, VanEck’s HODL, WisdomTree’s BTCW, and others, lag behind the top performers, collectively holding over $4 billion.On the Flipside
The surge in the institutional accumulation of Bitcoin could hamper retail investors’ ability to participate and access the market.



The success of Bitcoin ETFs has led to increased anticipation for Ethereum ETFs. However, the SEC’s reluctance to engage with proposers is diminishing optimism for approval.



Since its launch, Grayscale’s GBTC has recorded over $11 billion in outflows.
Why This MattersThe growing BlackRock Bitcoin stash reflects the broader impressive performance of BTC exchange-traded funds since their approval and launch, and the maintenance of this momentum could see the firm overthrowing Grayscale and becoming one of the largest BTC holders.Is the SEC unwilling to greenlight the proposed Ethereum ETFs?

372 Million Dollar Crypto Project Decided to Distribute Airdrop: Here are the Terms - Bitcoin Sistemi


Glif, the largest protocol and liquid credit platform in the Filecoin (FIL) ecosystem, announced that it has launched its points program before the token launch.
Filecoin storage providers (SPs) and liquidity providers (LPs), the two parties in the Glyph system, are eligible to earn points. Glif stated that points will be awarded to both past and future SPs and LPs.


As a liquid leasing protocol, Glif allows Filecoin (FIL) token holders to deposit FIL into a liquidity pool. In return, they receive iFIL, Glif's native liquid rental token. SPs rent the accumulated FIL and pay back the rental fees to the LPs and the protocol. After depositing FIL, LPs earn pro rata rental fees.
According to data from Filfox, Glif is currently the largest protocol in the Filecoin ecosystem, with a total locked value of over $372 million.






Glif's points schedule arrives just two days before the project's one-year anniversary. The protocol allocated 75 million points for past (50 million) and future (25 million) SPs and LPs, and each party will receive a 50% share of the total points.
The starting date for the distribution of past points was determined as March 30, 2023, the date when the protocol was launched. The starting date for future points will be March 28, will continue until September 26, and point distribution will be made every two weeks. Glif plans to convert its points into its upcoming native token at a 1:1 ratio.

$15 Billion Bitcoin Derivatives Bet on Post-Halving Price Surge - DailyCoin


        
The Bitcoin derivatives market has seen unprecedented activity, with open interest reaching $15 billion.



Spot Bitcoin ETFs and growing institutional participation have fueled the derivatives market.



While past halvings have seen price surges, the impact of this record-breaking open interest remains uncertain.
The Bitcoin market is buzzing with anticipation as the next halving event approaches on April 20th. This highly anticipated event, which cuts the reward for mining Bitcoin in half, has historically coincided with price surges. But this time, there’s a new wrinkle: a record-breaking level of open interest in Bitcoin derivatives contracts.Bitcoin Open Interest Hits Record HighsOpen interest, which refers to the total value of outstanding futures and options contracts, currently sits at a staggering $15 billion across major derivatives exchanges like CME, Derebit, OKX, Binance, and Bybit. This figure dwarfs the $2 billion seen before the 2020 halving, highlighting a dramatic increase in market sophistication and liquidity.The surge in open interest can be attributed to several factors. The introduction of spot Bitcoin ETFs in January has undeniably fueled institutional participation, while seasoned veterans are likely placing strategic bets in anticipation of the halving’s potential impact on supply and price.For some context, open interest wasn’t always a reliable indicator of market sentiment. Early Bitcoin futures platforms failed to gain traction, leaving the first halving in 2012 to transpire with a relatively small and nascent investor base. By the second halving in 2016, the landscape had shifted. Will History Repeat, or Is This Time Different?Established platforms like BitMEX offered derivatives, and traditional financial giants like CME and CBOE entered the fray. This marked the first time crypto derivatives were traded on regulated U.S. exchanges. This coincided with the peak of the 2017 bull run when Bitcoin skyrocketed from $1,000 to $20,000.The 2020 halving, however, presented a unique scenario. The global pandemic served as a backdrop, further solidifying Bitcoin’s image as “digital gold.” This marked the first time significant open interest signaled a maturing market with a broader investor base, including a growing institutional presence.
With the current open interest eclipsing the 2020 figure by a factor of seven, the upcoming halving promises to be a pivotal moment for Bitcoin. Whether it triggers another price rally remains to be seen, but one thing is clear: the market is approaching this event with a newfound depth and sophistication.On the Flipside
If the price of Bitcoin moves unexpectedly, it could trigger cascading liquidations, especially for overleveraged positions.



While past halvings coincided with price surges, there’s no guarantee the same will happen this time.
Why This MattersThe unprecedented open interest in Bitcoin derivatives suggests a far more mature market than previous halvings. This increased investor participation, particularly from institutions, could fuel significant price volatility and redefine how the market reacts to this historic Bitcoin event.

Bitwise Enters Race for Ethereum Spot ETF - Decrypt

Crypto investment firm Bitwise filed an application with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) today to offer a spot Ethereum ETF. Bitwise joins an increasingly crowded field of companies vying to bring the first Ethereum spot ETF to market following the successful launch of Bitcoin spot ETFs earlier this year.According to the S-1 registration form filed by Bitwise, the proposed "Bitwise Ethereum Trust" would hold Ethereum (ETF) and may stake a portion of the fund's assets through trusted staking providers to earn additional rewards. Staking—a practice that has drawn scrutiny by government regulators—involves locking up ether to help secure the Ethereum network and validate transactions, with participants earning newly minted ether as a reward.Bitwise's entry into the Ethereum spot ETF race comes amid growing interest from traditional financial firms. In recent months, asset management giant BlackRock, digital currency investment firm Grayscale, and VanEck have all filed proposals with the SEC to launch their own Ethereum spot ETFs. The increased competition reflects the potential demand for such products, as investors seek exposure to the second-largest cryptocurrency without the need to directly purchase and store it themselves.The filing comes soon after a Bitwise executive predicted that approval of an Ethereum spot ETF would not come this summer, as many have predicted—and said that waiting until later in the year could be a good thing."Spot Ethereum ETFs will gather more assets if they launch in December versus if they launch in May," Matt Hougan, Chief Investment Officer at Bitwise, in a recent tweet. "TradFi needs more time to digest the Bitcoin ETFs."The SEC has delayed decisions on several high-profile Ethereum spot ETF applications in recent months, including those from BlackRock, Grayscale, Fidelity, Invesco, and Galaxy Digital. Analysts like James Seyffart of Bloomberg originally predicted that delays would continue until May 23, the drop-dead deadline for the earliest applications from VanEck and Cathie Wood's Ark Invest. He now thinks they will be denied.Despite the delays, some experts remain optimistic about the prospects for Ethereum spot ETFs.British multinational bank Standard Chartered expects the SEC to approve such products by May, citing the regulator's lack of designation of ether as a security. The bank also predicts that the price of ether could reach $8,000 by the end of the year and $14,000 by the end of 2025, driven in part by the anticipated approval of spot ETFs.The potential impact of Ethereum spot ETFs on the cryptocurrency market could be significant. Since the approval of Bitcoin spot ETFs in January, billions of dollars have flowed into these funds, pushing up the price of the leading cryptocurrency. A similar effect may be seen with Ethereum, as traditional investors gain a more accessible avenue to invest in the asset.Stay on top of crypto news, get daily updates in your inbox.

Abra settles with fifth state as US operations may be winding down

Cryptocurrency platform Abra and its CEO William Barhydt reached a settlement with the Oregon Division of Financial Regulation, under which it will return assets held by Oregon users on the platform and cease and desist from offering unregistered securities in the state. This is the latest step in the United States-based company’s withdrawal from the U.S. market.Oregon is at  least the fifth state to take action against the companies that make up the Abra ecosystem. The state of Oregon charged Abra with violations of state securities laws in connection with its interest-bearing crypto depository accounts Abra Earn and Abra Boost. It required Abra to advise all account holders in the state to remove their crypto assets from the platform. If it succeeds in returning all assets to Oregon customers by April 25, it will not be subject to a monetary penalty.In Oregon, 167 Abra customers have $32,387.14 on the platform. The state of Iowa settled with Abra and its CEO in February, and Abra agreed to return $6,426.90 to its approximately 39 customers in that state. It would avoid a penalty of $461,610.14 by fulfilling the conditions of the settlement by March 6. Related: SEC and CFTC Fine Crypto Investment App for Offering Synthetic AssetsMaryland took action against Abra in September 2023 on behalf of 162 Marylanders with balances totaling $700,000. Maryland Attorney General Anthony Brown stated in the announcement:“Maryland has been participating in a working group of state securities regulators focused on interest-bearing crypto asset accounts.” This past January, Abra agreed in a settlement with the Texas State Securities Board to repay state residents their balances on the platform. That was the second action Texas had taken against Abra. In a June 2023 enforcement action, the Texas agency found that Abra had approximately 1,600 state residents on its platform with a balance of $1.8 million. It also claimed that Abra has been insolvent since March of that year, which was during the height of the banking crisis.Source: Bill BarhydtThe California Commissioner of Financial Protection and Innovation issued a consent decree in April 2023 requiring Abra to close out Californians’ Earn accounts, worth $19 million.Abra said in a blog post in July that it was ending retail operations in the United States.Magazine: Home loans using crypto as collateral: Do the risks outweigh the reward?

                        Cryptocurrencies like WIF, DOGE and CORE compete for best crypto to buy today  Image by cryptonews.com As Bitcoin (BTC) holds firm to the north of the $70,000 level amid reports in the Chinese media that the PBoC has been directed by President Xi Jinping to restart bond purchases for the first time in decades, investors are scouring altcoin markets as they hunt for the best crypto to buy today.China’s shift towards quantitative easing (QE) comes at a time when most other major global central banks are also on the brink of easing. The Fed, ECB and BoE are all expected to deliver rate cuts this year.Easing of financial conditions has historically been a big positive for crypto prices. That’s largely because easier financial conditions boost risk appetite amongst investors, benefitting riskier asset classes like stocks and crypto.Quarter-end choppiness as traders square expiring options positions could rock the boat this week.But Bitcoin price risks remain firmly tilted to the upside amid macro tailwinds and ahead of the halving.Both of these themes, plus Bitcoin’s strong Q1 performance, could encourage more traditional investors to add to their BTC exposure via spot Bitcoin ETF purchases.Further ETF inflows could add another tailwind to the BTC market in Q2, as was the case in Q1.Bitcoin remains odds on to hit $100,000 this year. That could mean easy 40-50% upside from current levels.For any investors new to crypto, Bitcoin is certainly the best crypto to buy today. After all, it’s the oldest and most trusted crypto, with by far the most adoption. It’s also the best-performing asset of all time.But some investors with high risk-reward appetites will be targeting larger than 40-50% gains this year.Those looking for gains in the region of 5-10x will need to find gems in the altcoin market.Here are some of Thursday’s top-performing altcoin names that could be the best crypto to buy today.Best Crypto to Buy TodayDogwifhat (WIF)After nearly two-weeks of consolidation, Dogwifhat (WIF) just broke out to fresh record highs above $3.50.Having pumped nearly 30% today to close to $3.90, WIF is closing in on $4 per token. That would take its market cap to $4 billion.That still around eight times smaller than Dogecoin, the leading meme coin crypto. WIF could easily still post 5x gains this bull market.That’s why WIF ranks as potentially the best crypto to buy today.Dogecoin (DOGE)Speaking of Dogecoin, the crypto industry’s leading meme coin is also up big on Thursday.Dogecoin (DOGE) was last trading around $0.22, up 18% today and at its highest level since December 2021.That still leaves it 70% down versus its 2021 record highs in the $0.70s. Indeed, many think that integration into a future X payments system could soon propel DOGE above $1.Dogecoin could still 5x from here, making it one of the best cryptos to buy today.Core (CORE)Innovative layer-1 blockchain protocol Core (CORE), whose blockchain is secured through a combination of delegated Bitcoin’s mining hash and delegated Proof-of-Stake (DPoS), is pumping on Thursday.As per CoinMarketCap, it was last up more than 15% in 24 hours. That has propelled its market cap to above $1 billion and into the top 100 cryptos by market value.Whether the blockchain will garner much adoption remains anyone’s guess. But at a still modest valuation of only $1 billion, there is plenty of room for upside.CORE could easily be the best crypto to buy today.New Crypto ICO Alternatives to Consider
Investing in smaller, lesser-known altcoins is one great way of turning a quick profit in crypto.But investors looking to up their risk profile shouldn’t neglect another highly profitable strategy – investing in new crypto ICOs.Up-and-coming web3 start-ups often look to raise funds in their infancy via the sale of their native protocol token.These sales are almost always conducted at a steep discount to the project’s potential. For example, most presales will sell their token at a price that gives them a market cap of $10-30 million.But successful projects can easily become billion-dollar market cap cryptos. Presale investors thus often target projects with 10-50x potential.Of course, investing in new crypto ICOs comes with a lot of the same risks as traditional start-up investing. The success of a project relies heavily upon the competency of management and execution.With so many new crypto ICOs to choose from, getting started can be a daunting task.Luckily, the experienced team at Cryptonews has already done a lot of digging.Here are 14 of their favorite projects:See the 14 Cryptocurrencies

Ripple (XRP) Bashed by Forbes: Cardano's Charles Hoskinson Responds


																TL;DR

Forbes labeled Ripple’s blockchain as ineffective and its token as purely speculative, questioning its utility and market value.
Charles Hoskinson and crypto supporters defended Ripple, making jokes with the media company’s report.


Forbes Takes Aim at Ripple (XRP)
The global media company Forbes recently published a report called “The Rise of Crypto’s Billion Dollar Zombies,” which touched upon numerous cryptocurrency protocols. It paid special attention to Ripple (the company behind the XRP token) and provided detailed information about its early days.
“To fund their ambitious project, executives at the company created 100 billion XRP tokens and sold $1.4 billion worth to the public. In early 2018, at the height of the first wave of crypto euphoria, XRP was trading with a market value of $132 billion, giving cofounder and executive chairman Chris Larsen a net worth of $8 billion.”
However, Forbes claimed that Ripple failed to meet its goal to improve the global financial network in the following years. The media company went even further, calling Ripple’s blockchain “useless.” 
“In terms of global money flows, not much is going on at Ripple Labs today, and few expect it ever to disrupt the Belgian banking cooperative known as SWIFT, which facilitates $5 trillion in interbank transfers every day. It’s largely useless, but the XRP token still sports a market value of $36 billion, making it the sixth-most valuable cryptocurrency,” the report reads.
Forbes’ bashing manifest did not stop here, describing Ripple and numerous other blockchains as “crypto zombies.” It also argued that the company’s native token – XRP – has “no purpose other than speculation.”




Hoskinson’s Reaction
One person who opposed Forbes’ report is Cardano’s founder, Charles Hoskinson. He jokingly mentioned that all cryptocurrency protocols mentioned by the media (most importantly Ripple, Algorand, Tezos, Bitcoin Cash, and Stellar) are “zombies,” but “it’s because we got all the brain.”

Numerous X users agreed with Hoskinson’s stance, calling Forbes’ report “a joke of an article.” It is worth noting that the media company has not always been that hostile toward the cryptocurrency industry. Earlier this month, it presented a list of the top 10 digital assets people should focus their attention on, with XRP being one of those.

Ethereum futures open interest at all-time high - Bullish or bearish?

Ether (ETH) has been grappling with the $3,600 level for the past three days, yet it seems traders may have overlooked the fact that the ETH price has soared by 58.8% since February. While some market participants attribute the limited upside to uncertainty surrounding the likelihood of a spot Ether exchange-traded fund (ETF) being approved in the U.S., others contend that the surge in Ether futures open interest indicates strong demand from institutional investors.Ether spot ETF decision in May is pivotal for Ether’s priceThe debate continues over the implications of the indictment by the United States Justice Department against the cryptocurrency exchange KuCoin. On one hand, the indictment is viewed as a negative for the industry due to the resulting tighter regulatory landscape. However, some argue that this event actually improves the prospects for the approval of a spot Ether ETF by May 25, the date by which the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) is expected to issue its final decision.A complaint filed on March 26 by the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) against KuCoin for illegal trading activities notably identified Bitcoin (BTC), Ether, and Litecoin (LTC) as “digital assets that are commodities,” falling firmly under the CFTC’s jurisdiction. This stance appears to directly challenge the SEC’s assertions that Ether could be considered a security.Source: Alexander GrieveBlackRock CEO Larry Fink remarked in a March 27 interview on FOX Business that listing an Ether ETF could still be feasible even if the asset is classified as a security by regulators, as reported by Unchained Crypto. Meanwhile, in a March 27 update on the X social network, Bloomberg senior ETF analyst James Seyffart reiterated his prediction of a denial in May, noting that the CFTC has recognized Ether as a commodity since at least February 2021, “when they allowed CME Ethereum futures to begin trading.”The growth of the Ether futures market is undoubtedly a positive development, as increased liquidity, particularly in the regulated Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME) market, facilitates participation by hedge funds and large asset managers. However, the fact that aggregate Ether futures open interest achieved a new record high on March 28 should not be immediately interpreted as a bullish indicator.Ether futures aggregate open interest, USD. Source: CoinglassIt is important to note that Binance leads the pack, amassing $4.55 billion in ETH futures market positions, with Bybit trailing at $2.4 billion. Meanwhile, the open interest in CME Ether futures currently sits at $1.3 billion. Thus, attributing the recent surge solely to institutional investor interest would be oversimplifying the matter.Moreover, in every derivatives market, the volume of long positions, those wagering on a price increase, invariably equals the volume of short positions, those betting on a decline. However, the demand for leverage can serve as an indicator of the market's bullish or bearish sentiment.Ether derivatives reflect moderate optimismPerpetual contracts, or inverse swaps, include a rate that adjusts based on the demand imbalance for leverage. A positive funding rate indicates increased demand for bullish leverage positions, whereas a negative rate suggests a preference for bearish positions.Ether perpetual futures 8-hour funding rate. Source: CoinglassRecent data indicates a rise in the demand for leveraged long positions in ETH, with the current funding rate at 0.04%, or roughly 0.8% on a weekly basis. Typically, rates above 1.2% per week signal excessive optimism, suggesting that traders are presently moderately bullish.To gauge professional traders’ sentiment more accurately, one should examine data from the Ether options market. The 25% delta skew provides insight into whether arbitrage desks and market makers are charging more for upward or downward protection. Specifically, a skew metric above 7% suggests expectations of a price decline, whereas excitement in the market usually results in a negative skew below -7%.Related: Covered call options strategy, explainedDeribit Ether 2-month options 25% delta skew. Source: LaevitasThe Ether option delta skew indicates balanced pricing between call and put options, aligning with a neutral market stance. However, a comparison with data from March 21, when the ETH skew metric showed signs of optimism, suggests that traders are now less optimistic about Ether's potential to surpass the $3,800 mark.This article does not contain investment advice or recommendations.

USDT Transaction Volume Soars on TRON DAO, Hits 2 Million Daily


																There has been a remarkable surge in USDT transactions within the TRON ecosystem via TronDAO, showing a substantial increase since early February, now averaging over two million transactions daily.
According to the latest data compiled by IntotheBlock, the surge brings the transaction volume close to the peak observed in January 2023.
USDT Transaction Volume Soars on TRON DAO
For the uninitiated, TRON DAO is a decentralized autonomous organization connected to a blockchain ecosystem. USDT, complying with the TRC-20 token standard on TRON, allows transfers using various non-custodial wallets like TronLink, Trust Wallet, and MetaMask.
TRON’s popularity for stablecoin transfers, particularly with USDT TRC-20 tokens, stems from its scalability advantage over Ethereum, resulting in comparatively lower on-chain fees.
With its higher throughput capacity, the TRON network supports intensive projects without the significant “gas” requirements associated with Ethereum, making it an increasingly favored platform for such transactions.






However, Tether, being a controversial entity in the eyes of several law enforcement agencies, has also brought its stablecoin, USDT, under scrutiny.
Recent reports, including a United Nations study earlier this year, suggest a rising trend of money laundering and fraudulent activities in Southeast Asia utilizing USDT for payments and fund transfers, particularly via its TRC-20 protocol.
However, Justin Sun and TRON DAO have refuted these allegations, with the latter stating active collaboration with on-chain forensic partners to share transaction-related information and dismiss such claims.
USDT Expansion
Despite the intense scrutiny and backlash, USDT has grown significantly in tandem with market recovery. The stablecoin broke above a milestone of $100 billion market cap earlier this month.
In terms of expansion, Tether recently announced the launch of USDT on the Celo blockchain, making it the 15 network to accommodate the leading stablecoin, after Ethereum, TRON, Polygon, Avalanche, and Algorand, among others.
Meanwhile, Tether has intensified its efforts to focus on artificial intelligence (AI) this year. Key areas of focus include the development of open-source, multimodal AI products to establish new industry benchmarks. Additionally, the crypto firm intends to collaborate with various entities to integrate AI solutions into market-oriented products, addressing real-world challenges.

Dogwifhat Hits All-Time High, Flips Pepe as Meme Coins Soar - Decrypt

While the broader cryptocurrency market has been relatively flat, meme coins have been on a tear, with Dogwifhat leading the pack. The most popular Solana memecoin reached a new all-time high earlier today.Dogwifhat is a relatively new meme coin launched on the Solana ecosystem in November of last year. Despite being a newcomer, it has made a name for itself in the highly competitive meme coin space. Today, the coin started at $3.21, traded sideways until about 9am ET, then suddenly started to spike, reaching an ATH of $3.90 at around 4:30pm ET. It's trading at $3.81 as of writing.Image: TradingviewThis marks Dogwifhat's best daily performance since its launch. It recently flipped relative veteran meme coin Pepe, rising to the 38th position in the Top 100 as Pepe settled in 43rd place with respective market caps of $3.8 billion to $3.37 billion, according to Coingecko.If all conditions remain the same, in fact, there is still room for further upward movement.Dogwifhat's Relative Strength Index (RSI)—an indicator that measures whether bulls or bears dominate the market— is currently at 69 points, suggesting that the coin is oversold. This means there is a risk that a major cohort of holders is waiting for the best time to realize their gains, which would trigger a correction in the price.Beyond this, given the young nature of the coin—limiting the amount of past data—it is hard to make any price projections based on technical analysis.It is also important to note that meme coins are extremely volatile and are known for their lack of fundamentals. The WIF vision, for example, is nothing else but "literally just a dog wif a hat". This makes them susceptible to drastic and unpredictable changes influenced by random events like tweets, unrelated news, and market movements of other coins. These tokens are driven more by market sentiment than anything else.Image: Dogwifcoin.orgOther memecoins are also doing well today. Besides Dogwifhat, the four best-performing tokens in the overall crypto industry's Top 100 are meme coins: Dogecoin (+16.83%), Floki (+12.7%), and BONK (+10%). Beyond the top 10, PEPE is up 8.29% and is currently being traded at $0.000008293 per token, Shiba Inu is up +5.85% to $0.00003179, and 65 out of the 100 biggest meme coins are posting some gains in the last 24 hours.Today has been a good day for meme coin traders overall—but these tokens also tend to crash fast. It's important to exercise caution when dealing with these assets due to their volatile nature, but chances are that you probably don't care if you're a HODLer.Edited by Ryan Ozawa.Stay on top of crypto news, get daily updates in your inbox.

Vitalik Buterin takes us through what comes next for Ethereum after blobs | Cryptopolitan

Vitalik Buterin, the man, the myth, the legend – back with us to discuss what is coming next for the blockchain diva Ethereum in the aftermath of the Dencun hard fork, an iconic event that launched the Ethereum network into a new scaling paradigm with the introduction of proto-danksharding, also known as EIP-4844 or, you know, blobs. Right out of the gate, this move slashed the cost of rollup transactions by a whole lot, over 100 times cheaper, because blobs were basically free. Just recently, we’ve seen blobs getting more action, and the cost for using them started to find its groove as more folks began using blobscriptions protocol.Vitalik said, after blobs hit the scene, scaling Ethereum went from a massive leap to just figuring out the next steps – it’s more about the nitty-gritty now. He’s talking about making blobs work harder and making sure rollups use each blob to its fullest. The big, earth-shattering changes to Ethereum? According to Vitalik, we’ve seen most of them. Now, it’s more about fine-tuning and looking towards issues that matter more to app developers and users.Ethereum’s New DirectionEthereum’s been on a slow movement towards something called a Layer 2 (L2) centric ecosystem. This means the heavy lifting isn’t done by the main Ethereum blockchain (Layer 1) but by these new layers built on top of it.Major apps are moving to L2, payments are being done on L2 by default, and wallets are getting designed around using multiple L2s. This whole shift was planned, aiming to make a special space in Ethereum blocks that can hold data for L2 projects but isn’t messed with by Ethereum’s main brain, the EVM.This is about setting the stage so in the future, nodes can just check bits of data to confirm everything’s there, without needing to look at everything. This trick, called data availability sampling, could let Ethereum hold a lot more data, aiming for about 16 MB per slot.EIP-4844, the blob thingy, doesn’t get us all the way there, but it sets up the basics. The real game changer, data availability sampling, can be added later without everyone having to redo their homework. The only big change needed down the line is a tweak in the settings.The Next Steps for EthereumSo, what’s next? Vitalik talked about two big to-dos: getting more data into each blob and making L2s smarter about using this data. There’s talk about a newbie version of data availability sampling called PeerDAS, where nodes share the load of holding onto data. This could let Ethereum handle a lot more data without breaking a sweat.And to keep things from getting too wild, there are ideas like EIP-7623 to keep the size of regular Ethereum blocks in check, making it safer to turn up the dial on how much data and how many transactions Ethereum can handle.L2 improvements are also on the menu. Vitalik says there’s a bunch of ways L2s can get better:Squishing Data: Making transactions take up less space.Smart Security: Figuring out ways to keep L2s safe without always running to L1 for help.Better Inside Workings: Making rollups and other L2s work more smoothly and handle more transactions without getting clogged up.Up the Security Game: Making sure rollups are as secure as they promise, moving from trust to proof.Vitalik told us we’re now past the big, crazy changes to Ethereum. The next steps are more about refining what’s already been built. He’s also thinking a lot about what all this means for the people making apps and using Ethereum. With lower fees thanks to blobs, the door’s open for apps that were too costly before. But, there’s a warning too. He says we’re not totally out of the woods yet. Fees could go up if things get too busy, so there’s more work to do on scaling.It’s Go Time for DevelopersVitalik explained that developers now have the tools they need to make things that are secure, user-friendly, and ready for the big time. He’s seeing signs that people are stepping up, like the Daimo wallet trying to be like Venmo but on Ethereum, and Farcaster aiming to make decentralized social networking actually nice to use.Vitalik’s point is clear though. Ethereum’s ready for the next wave of apps, and it’s on developers to make it happen. He’s also saying Ethereum isn’t just about just making transactions anymore. It’s about building a whole new kind of internet, with privacy, voting, and community at its heart.And for the apps still kicking it old school on Ethereum’s main layer?It’s time to level up and get with the times, boys! Embrace L2 and the new tools Ethereum’s got to offer.

Ethereum Reaches 1M Validators: Will It Boost the Network? - DailyCoin


        
Ethereum’s validator count rises sharply to 1 million. 



The Shapella upgrade catalyzed the growth in validators.



More validators enhance security but also raise concerns.
Ethereum, a cornerstone for DeFi, has recently marked a pivotal achievement by surpassing one million active validators. This development is crucial, considering validators are at the heart of Ethereum’s proof-of-stake (PoS) mechanism. However, the substantial increase in Ethereum’s validators, especially following the Shapella upgrade, has brought excitement and concern. Some have raised concerns about technical and centralization challenges that may arise from such a rapidly expanding validator count.Ethereum Validator Milestone Raises ConcernsOn Thursday, March 28, Ethereum reached a significant milestone in its validator count: 1 million, according to data from Dune. After Ethereum reached this milestone, concerns regarding the network started emerging in the crypto community. Source: DuneA notable discussion point revolves around the validator set’s growth, particularly after the Shapella upgrade, which allowed for the withdrawal of staked Ethereum. This upgrade is key for  Ethereum’s evolution towards a more scalable and energy-efficient network. However, as the number of validators grows, each must independently download the latest data and verify state changes within a constrained time frame. This means they require more computing power for larger data blocks.Validator Count Raises Centralization RisksAnother layer of concern is the potential for increased centralization. This scenario could emerge if the network’s growing bandwidth allows validators with significant computational resources to participate effectively.This privileges institution-owned data centers over individual, self-hosted nodes. Moreover, it pushes the Ethereum network towards centralization, which contradicts its foundational ethos.On the Flipside
It is also important to note that validators don’t represent signe entities. For an entity to run a validator, it must have 32 ETH. However, it is possible to run multiple validators on a single server. 



In January, Ethereum saw a significant lowering of its validator count, leading to concerns over staking rewards. 
Why This MattersEthereum’s transition to a proof-of-stake mechanism is crucial to enhancing efficiency. However, balancing this growth with the network’s foundational principles of decentralization and accessibility remains a critical challenge. Read more about issues with Ethereum validators:

'Som Bonkmon Fraud': SBF Meme Coins Pump 300x, Then Crash After Sentencing - Decrypt

If the 25 year prison sentence announced today for disgraced FTX founder Sam Bankman-Fried came as a shock to any, here’s a related development that will surely surprise no one: Degens churned up multiple meme coins to piggyback on the news, which in some cases surged over 30,000% in value before plummeting back to worthlessness.On Ethereum scaling network Base, some intrepid crypto user created a meme coin called "Sam Baseman Fraud" around 6:00 am ET, hours before Bankman-Fried’s sentencing hearing was set to begin. By 1 pm, just after the hearing concluded, the token (FTX) had spiked nearly 35,000% to a price of just over one cent. Minutes later, it collapsed. At writing, the token is worth less about 4/10ths of a penny, and continues to trend downwards—though since creation, it’s still up over 9,500%. That volatility hasn’t stopped degens from aping in, however. Of course not. “Sam Baseman Fraud” has already seen over $3.4 million worth of trading volume today, according to DexScreener. It still retains a market capitalization of $400,000, and $80,000 worth of liquidity—though that amount has been decreasing in recent hours as the novelty apparently fades.Meanwhile, on Solana, a near-identical, though marginally more creative token—"Som Bonkmon Fraud" (SBF)—lived through almost the exact same cycle, albeit with slightly different timing. Created yesterday, the Solana SBF token spiked some 15,000% yesterday evening. That streak continued overnight into the minutes before Bankman-Fried’s sentencing hearing began. At that point,  though, the coin started tanking—falling from just shy of a penny to under 9/100ths of a cent at writing. It is now down over 90% in the last 24 hours.For some reason—perhaps the ongoing meme coin frenzy on Solana, perhaps the cheeky allusion to meme coin sensation BONK, or perhaps the Solana-SBF connection—”Som Bonkman Fraud” has seen a massive $24 million in trading volume over the last day. The token retains $146,000 in locked liquidity, and—at the moment—is posting a $675,000 market cap. Today’s SBF tokens are hardly the first to capitalize on a major news event to spin up millions of dollars worth of capital out of nothing. Such tokens rarely result in happy endings for holders: They are routinely “rug-pulled” by their anonymous creators, who withdraw liquidity and leave investors holding the bag.Edited by Andrew HaywardDisclaimerThe views and opinions expressed by the author are for informational purposes only and do not constitute financial, investment, or other advice.Stay on top of crypto news, get daily updates in your inbox.

How high can Bitcoin go? New BTC price prediction sees cycle top at $180K

Bitcoin (BTC) price could gain another 150% during the current bull market cycle, according to Laurent Benayoun, the CEO of Acheron Trading and quantitative trading strategies expert. Bitcoin price top at $180K?The executive anticipates a potential cycle top of $180,000 for BTC price, based on a combination of factors, including the spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs), and the new supply reduction from the upcoming Bitcoin halving. Benayoun explained:“If we look at historical performance, with every cycle the multiple on the all-time is getting lower. So if we apply this reasoning it could be 2x to 3x what we saw in the previous cycles, so let's say around $120,000 to $180,000 per unit.”Improving financial policy in the United States will also contribute to Bitcoin’s price appreciation, according to Benayoun:“The market is pricing in a reduction in interest rates because they have been flatlining, so it’s reasonable to expect them to go down in the near future.”Other BTC price predictionsBenayoun’s prediction is in line with several other recent forecasts. Bitfinex analysts, for instance, see price reaching $120,000 by the end of 2024, according to a research report shared with Cointelegraph:“Our analysis forecasts a conservative price objective of $100,000-$120,000 to be achieved by Q4 2024, and the cycle peak to be achieved sometime in 2025 in terms of total crypto market capitalization. The ETFs have introduced passive demand which means demand is coming from investors that is largely price agnostic.” Meanwhile, wealth management giant Bernstein expects Bitcoin to break out to around $150,000 following the halving by mid-2025.Related: Max pain $51K? Bitcoin options worth over $9.4B set to expire FridayMore ambitious targets put Bitcoin price peaking at $337,000 in the bullish case. Willy Woo, Bitcoin analyst and managing partner at CMCC Crest, wrote in a March 11 X post:“BTC at 71k puts us *here* in visual of the upper and lower bound models. The upper bound right now is $337k. So this bull market is still early, equivalent to 20k of last cycle.”BTC price model. Source: Willy Woo on XWhat's more, seven-figure price targets are also emerging. One of the most well-known is from Ark Invest's Cathie Wood, who now sees a $1 million Bitcoin price as too conservative by 2030.“Our target is above that; it’s well above that, and with our new expectations for institutional involvement, the incremental price that we assume for institutions actually has more than doubled,” Wood said earlier this month.BTC/USDT, 1-day chart.

FTX Estate Ready to Sell Solana Lock for $7.5 Billion | Cryptopolitan

FTX real estate just sold for $41 million. The $7.5 billion sale price of locked Solana tokens attracted the attention of investors. Demand for the sale is strong, and many companies are interested in purchasing tokens from the property, people familiar with the matter said.Neptune Digital leads the wayNeptune Digital became the first company to publicly announce the acquisition of Solana locks from FTX Assets. The company announced that it will purchase 26,964 SOLs at a price of $64 per token. 20% of all tokens received will be locked in March 2025, and additional tokens will be locked every month until 2028. Neptune Digital’s move is the beginning of a push by many companies looking to invest in Solana tokens.Galaxy Trading is one of the sources used for investors to bid for some closed Solana tokens. Investors can participate for $64 per token and a 1% administrative fee. BitGo will be the token manager, and staking rewards will be distributed based on purchase volume, but the rewards will be locked to the underlying token.However, as FTX Legacy said on its dividend last time, there are reports that some investors are going out of business with a 13% drop in dividends. However, interest in purchasing unlocked Solana tokens remains high as investors look at the development potential of the token.Interest received from othersFTX Co. Other investment companies such as Equipment’s Solana expressed interest in purchasing their products. Pantera, for example, announced that it was seeking money to create a fund that would purchase up to $250 million in tokens. The fund will charge a 0.75% management fee and a 10% commission. Another fund, Phoenix, is also considering raising money for a similar project, but reports say the bid has failed.FalconX also announced that it will raise funds through a massive auction of unlocked Solana tokens. In addition, Galaxy Asset Management sold 42 more tokens, mostly Solana and Ethereum, for a total value of approximately $211 million. These tokens include Gatetoken, Atlas, Shadow Token, as well as Bitfinex’s token and sed leo.FTX’sSolana Token sale shows potential for growthFTX Asset Group’s sale of unlocked Solana tokens benefits investors; Neptune Digital was the first buyer, and Galaxy Business was also prepared to bid. This development reflects the growing demand for Solana and demonstrates the potential for further growth in the cryptocurrency market. Interest from other investment firms reflects widespread recognition of Solana’s value and appeal to a broader range of investors.The success of the sale has a positive impact on Solana’s reputation and may attract more investors willing to invest in its potential. Increased demand could increase Solana’s value, benefiting existing owners and attracting new investors looking to enter the market. Additionally, interest from investment firms such as Neptune Digital and Galaxy Business could provide Solana with additional credibility and legitimacy in the eyes of investors who could provide rapid growth and integration with traditional finance.Overall, FTX Asset Group’s Solana token sale is the most significant sale for cryptocurrencies and a sign of things to come.

Optimistic Outlook: Celestia (TIA) Price Targets a Bullish April


Celestia’s (TIA) price had a rather bearish March but this did not stop the optimistic bunch of investors from remaining hopeful of a rally.
This is evident in their behavior, which may result in a bullish April, provided their pessimism does not hinder the price action.
Celestia Price to Bounce Back?
Celestia’s price can be seen changing hands at $13.8 at the time of writing, barely recovering from $13. This, however, has not slowed the optimism that TIA investors hold as they continue to place bullish bets on the altcoin.
The Funding Rate of Celestia at the moment is positive. The funding rate is a mechanism used in perpetual futures contracts, which signals whether traders are placing long or short contracts. Positive funding rates hint at the former, while negative rates suggest the latter.

TIA’s positive rate shows that despite the correction, traders are expecting a rise in price. In part, they are right about their prediction since the Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) indicator is signaling bullishness.

MACD (Moving Average Convergence Divergence) is a trend-following momentum indicator that shows the relationship between two moving averages of a security’s price. It’s composed of a MACD line and a signal line, used to identify bullish and bearish trends.

Presently, the indicator is signaling that the altcoin is at the cusp of a bullish crossover. This hints at the incoming bullish momentum, which, if sustained, would drive TIA higher.
TIA Price Prediction: What to Expect Next?
Celestia’s price recovered a part of the 28% decline noted in mid-March. Looking at the aforementioned conditions, the chances of a rally seem high, which would likely send TIA to $18.

However, the retail investors are exhibiting slight pessimism at the moment. The overall sentiment they hold is negative, which might keep TIA from witnessing a substantial rally.

Should they move to protect their present gains from further losses, Celestia’s price could lose the support of $13.08 and fall to 11.5, slipping beyond which would invalidate the bullish thesis.
