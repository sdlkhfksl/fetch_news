Dogwifhat Triumphs Over PEPE to Claim Third-Largest Memecoin Title - DailyCoin


        
Solana’s pink hat-wearing memecoin WIF emerges as the day’s top gainer.



The 16% surge for Dogwifhat is ascribed to high demand for WIF’s Derivatives.



Derivatives traders put Dogwifhat in the spotlight, with volume topping $2.55B.
Dogwifhat (WIF) has left the popular frog-themed memecoin Pepe (PEPE) in the dust during an early morning rally on Good Friday. Intriguingly, WIF snatched the third spot by global market capitalization from PEPE while claiming a new all-time high (ATH).Solana’s memecoin Dogwifhat (WIF) reached a new all-time high at $4 at nearly 3AM GMT but later faced a retracement to $3.59. Comparing the global market cap, WIF now sports a $3,603,273,643 market cap, outsourcing PEPE’s market capitalization by over $300 million.Claiming a bronze medal in the meme currency department, Dogwifhat now aims to challenge the two top dogs, Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE), but the difference is huge. While the leading memecoin DOGE encircles a $30 billion market cap, Shiba Inu’s $18bn market cap is approximately six times larger than WIF’s.PEPE’s Glory Days Are Over?As PEPE was forced to step aside in the charts, it may be thought that the one-year-old coin is losing its relevance. However, judging solely by social metrics, PEPE’s dominance among memecoins remains strong. 
To illustrate, the last 24-hour period has garnered 7,719,552 interactions for PEPE across social media channels. By this metric, PEPE only compares to SHIB, which produced slightly over 7 million interactions. This is a huge contrast to the price movements of PEPE and WIF, as the latter fetched less than 1 million interactions during the same time frame.Coming off a new all-time high at $0.00001064, set on March 14, 2024, PEPE has already retraced 26.8% from the milestone. PEPE will first have to conquer the piling sell pressure to restore this price range, as the combined liquidity book showcases a $7 million gap between pending buys and sells.On the Flipside
Despite PEPE often being the most mentioned memecoin in social media and having a substantially larger liquidity on Spot markets, Derivatives markets tell a different story.



Dogwifhat’s Derivatives trades have topped $2.54 billion over the past 24 hours, accelerating WIF’s Open Interest (OI) by 17% to $502 million, according to CoinGlass.



On the other hand, PEPE’s Derivatives volume is at $1.17 billion, while the coin’s Open Interest (OI) metric plummeted by 3.55% despite the social dominance of PEPE.
Why This MattersMarch 2024 has been the most successful month for the memecoin department so far, amassing $80 billion in trading volume in the first week.Discover DailyCoin’s trending cryptocurrency news:Sam Bankman-Fried (SBF) Gets 25 Years: Here’s a Full BreakdownBlackRock’s BTC AUM Challenges Grayscale with 250K Milestone

$1,800,000 Up for Grabs As US City Launches Guaranteed Income Program With 'Unrestricted Cash Payments' - The Daily Hodl


								A new guaranteed income pilot project is gearing up for launch in Massachusetts.
The Somerville Guaranteed Basic Income Program is a $1.8 million pilot project designed to hand out $750 per month for one year to 200 families who are in danger of losing their homes.










The city is expected to draw funds from President Biden’s American Rescue Plan Act (ARPA), with the first round of monthly payments set to begin in July.
The city says it will proactively find families with a history of housing instability to create a pool of participants who can apply for the program.
“Guaranteed income programs provide unrestricted cash payments directly to vulnerable residents to create greater financial stability for those most in need. 
Somerville’s program goes beyond that general goal; it also specifically aims to support housing stability. The City’s program will serve a group of the city’s lowest-income households who are at risk of losing their housing…
This pilot program will be evaluated for its impact, efficacy, and future feasibility in partnership with the UMass Center for Social Policy and the Collins Center. Outcomes will be shared with the public and will inform future advocacy and any potential initiatives.”
At least 24 states across the US are launching various types of basic income programs, with over $200 million allocated to see how direct cash payments can help people and families in need.

CNC Agency Launches Innovation Lab to Merge AI with Physical Experiences

Independent experiential agency CNC Agency, previously known as Coffee ‘N Clothes, has launched an innovation division to focus on artificial intelligence (AI), augmented reality (AR), and immersive content. This strategic move combines creative and technological strategies that provide new dimensions to the physical experiences. First founded in 2014 as an Instagram hashtag, CNC Agency believes their background in experiential and digital marketing makes them stand out in this venture.Innovative offerings for brandsUnveiled in January, the new CNC Innovation Lab will solve the problems of brands looking to differentiate in the market. It has eight pillars: AI, Immersive Spaces, AR, Fake Out of Home (FOOH), Creative Engineering, Gaming, Wearables, and Customer Relationship Management (CRM). Ryan Glick, the founder of CNC Agency, stated that the lab will concentrate on pushing the technological boundaries and offer innovative, tailor-made solutions for brands really willing to excel.AI, specifically, is set to more and more take a more critical role in the gap that exists between digital and physical content. Glick said that clients are more and more geared toward business problems as opposed to technological challenges. The agency wants to use AI to create immersive and personal content that delves into high-con’s imaginative concepts, such as using AI to simulate a Louis Vuitton pop-up ski resort. In this view, the CNC plans to integrate more of the emerging hardware and even the digital content in this immersive space by using technologies such as projection mapping, VR, mixed reality, and robotics.Client testimonials and industry analysisOne such client is Dylan Abruscato, the founder of the digital game “Crypto,” who praised CNC Agency for being the only firm that came back consistently with creative ideas across projects. Analysts say agencies like CNCs have an advantage as clients take tentative steps into AI and other emerging technologies. Stefanie Beach, CEO of SMB Media Consulting, pointed to the fact that the specialty in solutions and industry expertise will be the prime factor in breaking through the colossal completion in the agency landscape. With the evolution of AI in the agency world, it expects even more from agencies developing use cases for clients and expanding focus areas—just as CNC is doing. However, there are some challenges in translating AI experiments into billable work for the agencies.That’s because, while the approaches lead to conversation starters for tests, what’s actually sold is mostly work on machine learning, app development, and traditional agency services. CNC Agency setting up an Innovation Lab is synonymous with the strategic alignment between technological innovation and experiential marketing. The agency aims to provide avant-garde solutions that separate brands in this highly competitive landscape with advanced technologies like AI, AR, and immersive content. With the industry still developing, agencies have to grapple with challenges in translating experimental technologies into tangible, billable services. However, the launching of the CNC Innovation Lab is a huge step in repositioning what was initially referred to as the crossroads of digital and physical experience with an environment ideal for advancing marketing and branding strategies.

Dogecoin to the moon? Market reacts to DOGE's 3-year price high - AMBCrypto



Dogecoin surged to $0.21, attracting retail and institutional investor’s interest.
Dogecoin GigaWallet v1.0 releases and DOGE futures debut hints at growth potential.

In recent days, the spotlight has once again turned to Dogecoin [DOGE], the meme-based cryptocurrency that has captured widespread attention. Surging nearly 37.39% within a week to reach $0.22, the coin has sparked the interest of both retail and institutional investors. 
All thanks to the GameStop saga starting in January 2021, fueled by small investors and Reddit’s WallStreetBets community, and Tesla CEO Elon Musk for endorsing the dog-themed memecoin. 
DOGE breaks its previous record 
According to CoinMarketCap, DOGE reached its highest point in three years at $0.22. This surge aligned with the growth of wallet addresses on its blockchain, now at 6.27 million with the introduction of GigaWallet v1.0. 
Remarking on the same, Dogecoin Foundation noted,
“Dogecoin GigaWallet v1.0 has been released. Thank you to the early adopters already building great solutions on Dogecoin.”
The tweet further elaborated,
“GigaWallet is a backend service which provides a convenient integration API for platforms such as online shops, exchanges, social media platforms etc, to programmatically transact Dogecoin.”
Moreover, there’s continued excitement for the 1st of April debut of DOGE futures on Coinbase, hinting at potential price spikes.
Jumping into the fray @david_dogecoin said, 
“BTC is about to cross. When that crosses, dogecoin will fly. To the moon.”
What will be DOGE’s next move?
Contrary to expectations, Parth Chaturvedi, Investments Lead at CoinSwitch Ventures, in conversation with The Economic Times, interprets Dogecoin’s recent performance as a stable turnaround from its low point. He predicts potential selling pressure in Dogecoin’s future. 
Hence, with its recent milestones and upcoming developments, the future of Dogecoin remains uncertain, leaving investors eagerly anticipating the next twist.

Ripple Shares 2 Major Technical Advances For The XRP Ledger


								Ripple, through its development arm RippleX, unveiled two significant technological advancements for the XRP Ledger (XRPL). These developments involve the roll-out of a new version for the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) sidechain in the devnet and updates to the XRPL’s Automated Market Maker (AMM) functionality. Both enhancements are pivotal in Ripple’s strategy to enhance the XRPL’s capabilities in cross-border payments and decentralized finance (DeFi).
Ripple And Peersyst Releases New EVM Bridge
The announcement of the EVM sidechain, a collaborative effort between Peersyst Technology and Ripple, marks a notable milestone in the XRPL’s evolution. Through a statement shared by Peersyst Technology via X (formerly Twitter), the companies highlighted the completion of a significant update for the EVM sidechain.

“Exciting milestone reached on the EVM Sidechain! We are very excited to release the new version of the bridge with a new scalable interface for future #XRPLedger interoperability,” Peersyst Technology announced. This development introduces a scalable interface that promises to significantly enhance the XRPL’s interoperability capabilities.


It is designed to accommodate multiple networks, wallets for each network, and various tokens for each pair of networks. Moreover, it introduces the ability for dynamic bridge creation by users for any ERC20/IOU token, facilitating permissionless cross-chain applications with any asset. “This will allow us to add to the portal all the networks that have bridges with #XRPL and list multiple wallets for all these networks.
The development of the XRPL EVM sidechain has been structured into three phases, starting with its launch on the XRPL devnet (in October 2022) and culminating in the introduction of a permissionless EVM sidechain connected to the XRPL mainnet (to be announced). This phased approach ensures thorough testing and scalability assessments, paving the way for a robust framework that supports increased participation and interoperability with other blockchain networks.
XRP Ledger AMM Feature To Be Activated On April 11
On another front, RippleX communicated a vital update regarding the XRPL AMM feature. An amendment to fix a discovered bug has achieved over 80% consensus for activation, a development expected to take effect on April 11. RippleX urged node and validator operators to update their infrastructure to rippled version 2.1.1, emphasizing the importance of this update for the continued smooth operation of the XRPL AMM feature.


In a recent blog post, Brad Chase, a developer at RippleX, detailed the events leading up to the discovery and resolution of the bug. “Last Friday, after over two years in the making, XLS-30, the Automated Market Maker (AMM) amendment, went live on XRP Ledger mainnet. However, a bug affecting the AMM functionality was discovered the following day,” he stated.

The bug, identified with the assistance of community members Tequ and Orchestra Finance, involved an inconsistency in how the payment engine interacts with order books and AMM pools, leading to incorrect liquidity draw from an AMM pool in certain scenarios.
The rectification process involved a comprehensive approach, encompassing the development of a fix, extensive testing, and the preparation of the network for the amendment’s activation. The commitment to transparency and collaboration in addressing the bug was evident in RippleX’s communication and the mobilization of the XRPL community to mitigate the bug’s impact and ensure a swift resolution.
At press time, XRP traded at $0.62843.

Grayscale revolutionizes investments with the proof-of-stake fund

Grayscale has announced the launch of a new “variable income fund” aimed at investors with a net worth of over $2.2 million, focused on investments in proof-of-stake tokens.
Let’s see below all the details. 

The future of investments: proof-of-stake tokens with Grayscale
As anticipated, Grayscale has announced the imminent launch of a new “dynamic income fund”, focused on investing in proof-of-stake tokens, in a publication released on X.
The company has specified that the fund, identified by the ticker GDIF, will be accessible exclusively to accredited investors with a net worth of at least 2.2 million dollars.
Furthermore, Grayscale has emphasized that GDIF will represent the company’s “first actively managed investment product”. 
The stated goal of the fund will be to maximize returns through staking rewards associated with proof-of-stake digital assets. 
The fund will be responsible for managing the staking and unstaking of a series of tokens, distributing the related rewards to its investors.
While Grayscale continues to expand its range of financial products, its spot ETF on Bitcoin, regulated by the Securities and Exchange Commission, has attracted attention.
Since the beginning of trading in January, the ETF has recorded significant losses in terms of value, despite remaining the largest in terms of assets managed. 
According to The Block Data Dashboard, Grayscale ranks second in trading volume, behind only BlackRock’s Bitcoin spot ETF.
The operational modes of GDIF
In its announcement, Grayscale clarified the functioning of GDIF, stating the following: 
“Interests in GDIF have not been, and will not be, registered under the U.S. Securities Act of 1933 … or any state or other securities law.”
Furthermore, the information disclosed by Grayscale has indicated that the fund “will not be registered as an investment company under the Investment Company Act of 1940 of the United States”. 
Furthermore, it will not be required to adhere to certain restrictions and requirements under the Investment Company Act, and investors will not be granted the protections of the Investment Company Act. 
Grayscale optimistic about the approval of Ethereum ETFs
The legal head of Grayscale remains confident about the possible approval by the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) for Ethereum (ETH) linked Exchange Traded Funds (ETFs).
According to Craig Salm, Ethereum ETFs “should be approved” and he urges not to be influenced by the negative rumors surrounding the proposed financial products.
Salm adds that the lack of explicit commitment from the SEC on Ethereum ETF requests should not necessarily be considered as a negative sign. 
He explained that the SEC has shown a positive and constructive commitment during the months leading up to the approval of Bitcoin ETFs.
It clarified that the procedures and technical details discussed with the SEC are similar for both Bitcoin ETFs and Ethereum ETFs, with the only difference being that instead of holding Bitcoin, the ETF will hold Ether.
Despite the delay of the SEC in deciding on the approval of the Ethereum ETFs proposed by BlackRock and Grayscale, Salm expresses optimism about the approval process. 
Therefore, not considering the lack of commitment from the regulatory authority as indicative of a negative outcome.
The SEC has recently postponed the decision date on the proposed Ethereum ETFs by Hashdex and Ark 21Shares, moving the deadline from March 31 to May 30, to have more time to evaluate the proposed rules.

Crypto, it’s time to demand clarity from the courts - Blockworks


On March 25, 2024, Beba, a small apparel company located in Waco, TX, partnered with the DeFi Education Fund to file a lawsuit against the Securities and Exchange Commission. The suit challenges the SEC’s statements that there may be securities law implications with Beba’s intent to sell duffel bags to people at a discounted price.
No, you did not read that incorrectly.
If your first reaction was to ask “why would the SEC be involved in this at all?,” then your reaction probably lines up with the overwhelming majority of people who are familiar with securities law and/or duffel bags. 
Now, let me introduce an additional piece to the puzzle: Beba plans to gatekeep access to the sale, making its duffel bags available exclusively to holders of a specific blockchain token.
This small detail reveals why it is so important that a company like Beba takes this action. The SEC’s actions over the past several years have made the operating environment for crypto native companies attempting to do things the right way nigh-impossible. There is no clear path to compliance. This uncertainty has also empowered the worst actors in the space by removing the usual guard rails that would serve as signals to protect the average investor.
Why? The SEC has failed to write rules for crypto, with the exception of a clear statement that effectively bans US banks from acting as custodians (SAB 121). This means we have an operating environment where there is no good legal framework to determine the good actors from the bad. As a result, the average investor can’t tell FTX from Coinbase. To add to that, the SEC continues to enforce securities laws based on undisclosed and contradictory interpretations, so what is a company that wants to follow the law supposed to do? How is a company supposed to ensure compliance when they don’t know what to comply with?
This brings us back to duffel bags. What Beba intends to do is simple: distribute tokens via blockchain airdrops that would allow recipients to buy its bags at a discount. If this was done via a private wallet app, via the US postal service or just by handing out flyers on the street, it would be uncontroversially clear that this was not a securities offering. However, the direct involvement of blockchain technology introduces ambiguity due to the SEC’s vague regulations, leaving Beba uncertain whether its distribution methodology could inadvertently trigger a securities enforcement action.
To counter this, Beba is doing something that I have suggested for years: Demand clarity from the courts. This is something that I believe is the correct path forward if Congress will not act and the SEC continues with its incoherent, contradictory approach to crypto. 
In the end, the United States is a nation governed by laws, where individuals and entities have rights. And at a bare minimum, the SEC needs to obey the law and respect the rights of Americans. In one case already, the SEC was sanctioned by a federal judge for making false claims so egregious about the DEBT Box platform that the regulator was forced to pay the platform’s legal fees. With this in mind, it is completely appropriate for crypto projects to try to move forward by taking their own actions to force the SEC to give both legal clarity and fair treatment.
Read more from our opinion section: Yes, staking actually should be regulated
Given the SEC’s notorious position of silence, Beba’s process of securing a response from the commission becomes more crucial than the actual details of that response. If there is a coherent and clear theory for why this activity does fit neatly within the securities regulatory framework, the SEC should just articulate that so people can act accordingly. Yet, so far they have refused to do so. 
Even SEC Commissioners themselves are calling the agency out for the complete disarray they have created for investors and builders, with both Commissioner Hester Pierce and Mark Uyeda including a parody of interactions with the SEC in a dissent that ends as follows:
“FSS [crypto platform]: I’ve read about your enforcement actions.  I still have questions.
SEC: Hire a lawyer. 
FSS:  I did, and the lawyer has even more questions. 
SEC: Sorry, we cannot help any more than we already have. We don’t give legal advice.”Should it be this way? No. The SEC needs to stop obfuscating and obstructing, and instead return to its core job of regulating securities laws effectively. Congress also needs to step in, both to pass legislation to create legal clarity and to rein in the SEC so this conduct cannot expand to other industries.
Finally, when regulators refuse to comply with demands for fair treatment and clarity, and Congress remains unresponsive, the American judicial system stands as a crucial avenue for redress. It’s time the crypto space starts using it effectively.

Former FTX Execs To Pay $1.3 Million in Lawsuit Settlement Deal


                        
                            Former FTX Executives and Promoters To Pay $1.35 Million in Lawsuit Settlement Deal

Several FTX executives have agreed to settle a class action lawsuit following founder Sam Bankman-Fried's sentencing yesterday.
                        Following Sam Bankman-Fried’s sentencing, former FTX executives and promoters agreed to a $1.3 million class action lawsuit settlement, according to court documents filed yesterday.Former head of engineering for FTX, Nishad Singh, Alameda Research CEO, Caroline Ellison, chief technological officer for FTX, Gary Wang, and seven promoters of the bankrupt exchange have all agreed to forfeit a total sum of $1.3 million following claims that they participated in and perpetuated ringleader Sam Bankman-Fried’s multi-billion dollar fraud on FTX customers.FTX Executives Pay Up in Lawsuit Settlement
In addition to having “pled guilty in the criminal proceedings against them,” FTX insiders  “have agreed to full restitution and forfeiture” of the designated sum. The agreement will allow Judge Lewis A. Kaplan, who presided over the U.S. government’s case over Sam Bankman-Fried case, to decide “how the FTX victim funds recovered from them will be provided to the FTX victims.”“The FTX collapse—the rapid unraveling of one of the world’s biggest scams—is certainly one of recent history’s greatest financial disasters,” the settlement reads. “For over a year, Plaintiffs and MDL Counsel have worked tirelessly to efficiently litigate these claims to benefit all FTX Victims. Today, those efforts begin to bear fruit.”Sam Bankman-Fried Sentenced To 25 Years, $11 Billion Fine
The FTX lawsuit agreement follows Bankman-Fried’s March 28th sentencing hearing in Manhattan federal court which saw the now disgraced FTX founder sentenced to 25 years in prison.Judge Kaplan compared Bankman-Fried’s massive digital asset fraud to a game where he weighed the chances of getting caught “against the gain of getting away without getting caught, given the probabilities.”In addition to his lengthy sentence, Bankman-Fried has been ordered to pay over $11 billion in forfeiture.“I know a lot of people feel really let down, and they were right, they were, were very let down,” Bankman-Fried told the court. “I’m sorry about that. I’m sorry about what happened at every stage, things I should have done and said, and things I shouldn’t have. I failed everyone I care about and everything I care about too.”He, however, doubled down on the belief that the crypto exchange “always” had enough assets to cover its losses and that he was “hopeful” and “optimistic” that the exchange would pay back customers, lenders, and investors in the near future.FTX Bankruptcy Estate In Hot Water
Meanwhile, the FTX bankruptcy estate continues to trudge numerous legal challenges, most recently acquiring Unabomber prosecutor Robert J. Cleary to investigate law firm Sullivan and Cromwell’s potential conflicts of interest with the crypto exchange.The law firm is also facing a February 2023 class action lawsuit from several FTX investors who claim Sullivan and Cromwell “got rich” off Bankman-Fried’s businesses.“S&C stood to gain financially from the FTX Group’s misconduct and so agreed, at least impliedly, to assist that unlawful conduct for its own gain,” the lawsuit reads.Bankman-Fried has been ordered to live out his sentence in a medium-security prison given in part to his connection to “vast wealth.” He has two weeks from the date of the court’s judgment submission to appeal the case.

Bitcoin’s 2023-2024 growth rate has it on track to surpass Microsoft within a year

Bitcoin has had a banner year so far in 2024. It reached a new all-time high price of $73,679 on March 13, and in the time since, it’s hung around the $70,000 threshold — putting it up more than 140% over the same time last year. When Bitcoin (BTC) reached its 2024 peak (so far) and new all-time high, it briefly surpassed silver as the eighth most valuable commodity in the world by market capitalization. Related: Bitcoin price nails new $73.6K all-time high as ETFs eat away at supplyIn the current market situation, if one could fast-forward another year under the exact same growth rate, Bitcoin would reach a price of approximately $170,574 by the beginning of April 2025. This would put it ahead of silver today, as well as Amazon, Alphabet (Google), Saudi Aramco, Nvidia and Microsoft to take the second-place spot on CompaniesMarketcap’s list of the top 100 commodities by capitalization. Source: CompaniesMarketCapWhile this number only holds water when imagining a scenario where Bitcoin grows and the rest of the market remains static, today’s market capitalizations can be used as a measuring stick for what Bitcoin’s potential future growth could look like.SilverIf silver’s market cap remains at its current value of $1.412 trillion, Bitcoin could surpass it again by increasing its current price point from $69,678 (as of the time of this article’s publication) to $71,732. This would give Bitcoin a total market capitalization of approximately $1.413 trillion and sole possession of the eighth-place spot on the list. GoogleThe Mountain View search giant currently has a market capitalization of $1.885 trillion, just $12 billion ahead of Amazon. Bitcoin can surpass them both and claim the sixth-place spot on the list by reaching a price of approximately $95,642 to surpass a market cap of $1.885 trillion. This would put it squarely behind Saudi Aramco, which currently sits in fifth place with a cap of $1.984 trillion. MicrosoftFourth and third on the list are occupied by Nvidia and Apple, respectively. Bitcoin will have to reach a total market value of about $2.65 trillion in order to slide into third place and have a shot at knocking Microsoft out of its second-place slot. The number to beat there, if Bitcoin is to surpass Microsoft’s $3.126 trillion cap and reach number two on the list, is approximately $165,608 per BTC.While this might seem lofty given its current price at just under $70,000, it’s worth remembering that the price of Bitcoin increased by approximately 144.82% year over year from April 2023 through the end of March 2024.If Bitcoin increased by 144.82% in the next year, from its current value of $69,678, it would reach approximately $170,574. At this price, its market cap would be approximately $3.224 trillion, more than enough to overtake Microsoft. GoldOnce Bitcoin secures second place — again, assuming the entire market remained static and BTC’s price alone rose —its price would need to be approximately $800,476 per BTC to achieve a market cap of $15.15 trillion. This would beat gold’s current cap of $15.141 trillion and give the world’s first cryptocurrency the top slot on the market cap leaderboard.

CryptoQuant CEO Says Bitcoin Giving Out 2020 Cycle Vibes, Suggests Real BTC Bull Market Is Underway - The Daily Hodl


								The head of blockchain analytics platform CryptoQuant believes that Bitcoin’s (BTC) current market cycle may be mirroring the prior one in 2020-21.
Ki Young Ju tells his 341,600 followers on the social media platform X that if Bitcoin is following the price patterns of the prior cycle the crypto king’s “real” bull market is just kicking off.










The analyst parses Bitcoin’s cycle into three main phases: recovery, the bull market to the previous all-time high and the real bull market, when Bitcoin prints new all-time highs.
“Bitcoin gives me the same vibe as four years ago. 
2020-21: 

$3,000-$9,000 (Recovery). 
$9,000-$19,000 (Bull market to previous all-time high). 
$20,000-$68,000 (The real bull market). 

2023-24: 

$15,000-$45,000 (Recovery). 
$45,000-$68,000 (Bull market to previous all-time high). 
$68,000-$___,000 (The real bull market).” 

The analyst also believes that on-chain data is showing long-time deep-pocketed investors are selling Bitcoin as the price hovers around the prior all-time high of about $69,000, but traditional finance (TradFi) groups are buying up the supply.
“Old whales are selling Bitcoin to new whales (TradFi), not retail investors. This can be clearly observed on-chain.”
Source: Ki Young Ju/X
The analyst previously said that the level of Bitcoin investment from institutional investors is unprecedented this cycle, totaling $86 billion in the last six months alone.
Bitcoin is trading for $69,286 at time of writing, down nearly 3% in the last 24 hours.

Taiwan is Trying to Get Ahead of Rival Countries in the Cryptocurrency Industry! They Approved Another Innovation! - Bitcoin Sistemi

Taking an important step towards formalizing the cryptocurrency industry, Taiwan's Ministry of Internal Affairs has approved the establishment of an industry association by the local crypto industry.
This move marks the government's progress towards regulating the domestically developing cryptocurrency space.


Taiwan Approves Formation of Crypto Industry Association, Approaches Regulatory Framework
The local cryptocurrency industry working group, which met last year to pave the way for the establishment of an industry association, announced today that it has received official approval from the government for its application.
The green light from the authorities marks a pivotal moment for the cryptocurrency industry in Taiwan.





According to the working group, the next step includes completing all necessary preparations to officially establish the crypto industry association by the end of June in accordance with government requirements.
This milestone underscores collaborative efforts between industry stakeholders and regulatory authorities to create a framework for responsible cryptocurrency transactions in Taiwan.



Currently, the working group consists of 22 cryptocurrency firms, including leading exchanges such as MaiCoin and BitoPro.
ACE Exchange, in particular, was removed from the group by prosecutors amid ongoing investigations into alleged misconduct by its former executives.





The establishment of a crypto industry association represents a significant step towards self-regulation in the industry.
While Taiwan currently requires cryptocurrency service providers to comply with anti-money laundering laws introduced by the Financial Supervisory Commission in July 2021, the broader crypto industry remains largely unregulated.

HKVAEX announces full shutdown amid regulatory pressure - Crypto Briefing




HKVAEX, a Hong Kong-based crypto trading platform allegedly backed by Binance, will completely cease its operations in May, according to a Thursday notice. The decision comes one day after the exchange withdrew its application for a Virtual Asset Trading Platform (VATP) license in Hong Kong.
“We are writing to you to announce that, HKVAEX will commence a phased suspension of services starting from April 1 2024. This will lead to a complete closure of our official website on [May 1 2024],” wrote the exchange.
Starting April 1, HKVAEX will phase out its services, which will lead to the full termination of its website the following month. The exchange has already ceased new registrations and virtual asset deposits.Trading will end on April 5, with all existing orders being canceled, as noted by HKVAEX. After delisting, HKVAEX will offer support for asset withdrawals until April 30. Customers are urged to withdraw their assets by the end of April.Established in December 2022, HKVAEX offers crypto exchange services under the name BX Services Limited. The exchange is allegedly linked to Binance after its promotional materials listed Binance as a “partner.” Despite these claims, Binance denies any affiliation with HKVAEX.HKVAEX filed a license application with the Hong Kong Securities and Futures Commission (SFC) in January this year. However, on March 28, it withdrew its filing, according to a new update from the SFC.The reason behind HKVAEX’s decision to retract its license application remains in question. Chinese reporter WuBlockchain suggested that this “may include a request to change the audit company” or “insufficient materials.”HKVAEX’s latest move comes amid tightening government scrutiny in Hong Kong.Earlier this month, the SFC issued a public warning about BitForex, a virtual asset trading platform suspected of fraud. Despite claiming to be based in Hong Kong, the SFC claimed that BitForex had not applied for a license from the SFC for its operations.The SFC further flagged Bybit for operating without licenses within its jurisdiction, categorizing them as suspicious virtual asset trading platforms.According to a recent update from the SFC, unregistered virtual asset trading platforms must shut down their business operations in Hong Kong by the end of May.
“Virtual asset trading platforms operating in Hong Kong which have not submitted their license applications to the SFC by February 29 2024 must close down their businesses in Hong Kong by May 31 2024. Investors using these platforms should make preparations early,” stated the SFC.

$1.4 Billion USDC Moved To Coinbase: Will History Repeat And Bitcoin Rally?


								On March 29, a massive $1.4 billion transfer of USDC, a fiat-backed stablecoin issued by Circle, was moved to Coinbase, one of the leading crypto exchanges. 
Sharing a screen grab that cites CryptoQuant’s data, the analyst said the hefty inflow could suggest that bulls might be ready to inject capital. If that happens, top cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum could benefit.

Are Bitcoin And Ethereum Ready To Turn The Corner?
Looking at Bitcoin and Ethereum, it is evident that sellers might be in control, rejecting attempts for higher highs. Bitcoin trades below the $71,600 resistance level, marking March 28 highs. 

On the other hand, Ethereum is yet to fully capitalize on post-Dencun expectations to break higher, above $3,700. The coin remains under pressure, with the odds of falling below $3,200 a possibility if bulls fail to flow back.

The analyst believes that the influx of USDC into Coinbase indicates a growing willingness among investors to enter the crypto market. Stablecoins have emerged as preferred conduits for traditional finance capital to flow to crypto. 
Popular stablecoins like USDT and USDC are backed by fiat and can be redeemed for cash. Usually, stablecoin inflows into the exchange are seen as a positive development, a net positive for crypto, and mostly leading assets.
Will History Repeat? Past USDC Inflows Lifted Price
Still, while prices might expand in the coming sessions, the fact that $1.4 billion USDC was channeled into Coinbase can’t be the main fuel. The crypto and Bitcoin or Ethereum markets have deep liquidity, with sentiment mostly or big money injection from institutions as primary drivers of price. 
Previous USDC inflow | Source: Analyst on X
Even so, the general confidence is warranted. This isn’t the first time a bulk USDC transfer to Coinbase has coincided with a crypto upswing. In January 2023, the analyst notes, a $1.3 billion USDC inflow to Coinbase preceded a price spike that saw the coin rise from around $16,300. 
Therefore, with this historical precedent in mind, traders are bullish and expect a possible recovery for Bitcoin and Ethereum. 

USDC has been steadily gaining traction and is now poised to potentially dethrone XRP as the world’s sixth most valuable crypto. According to CoinMarketCap data on March 29, USDC has a market cap of $32.5 billion. On the other hand, XRP, the native currency of the XRP Ledger, has a market cap of over $34 billion.

If the fall continues, one can expect a test of the $0.64 zone tomorrow.Image by TradingViewOn the daily time frame, neither bulls nor bears are dominating as the rate is far from the support and resistance levels. Such a statement is also confirmed by the low volume, which means ADA needs more time to accumulate energy for a further move.In this regard, ongoing consolidation in the narrow range of $0.64-$0.68 is the more likely scenario for the next days.Image by TradingViewFrom the midterm point of view, the situation is similar to the daily chart.

ARKK's Tech Bets: Over 500k Roblox Shares Purchased, 1.24M Robinhood Shares Sold - Tokenist


					
Neither the author, Tim Fries, nor this website, The Tokenist, provide financial advice. Please consult our website policy prior to making financial decisions.



Cathie Wood’s ARK Innovation ETF (ARKK) had an active week of trading, with a mix of buying and selling across various holdings. The ETF, known for its focus on disruptive technology companies, made significant moves in several key positions.



ARK Innovation ETF Purchased Over 500,000 Roblox Shares this Week



One of the most notable transactions was the purchase of over 500,000 shares of Roblox (NYSE: RBLX) on March 25, representing a 0.2375% increase in the ETF’s holdings. 



The gaming platform has been a popular investment for ARKK, with additional purchases of 21,508 shares on March 26 and 1,845 shares on March 27. Other significant buys included Tesla (NASDAQ: TSLA), with 133,334 shares added on March 25, and Recursion Pharmaceuticals (NASDAQ: RXRX), with 609,626 shares purchased on March 26.





ARK Innovation ETF Sold Over 1.24 Million Robinhood Shares this Week



However, the ETF also made some substantial sales during the week. Robinhood Markets (NASDAQ: HOOD) saw the largest reduction, with 1.247 million shares sold on March 25, representing a 0.3027% decrease in ARKK’s holdings. Other notable sells included Zoom Video Communications (NASDAQ: ZM) and Coinbase Global (NASDAQ: COIN), with 154,601 and 57,652 shares sold, respectively, on March 25. Twilio (NYSE: TWLO) also experienced a sell-off, with 104,425 shares sold on March 22 and an additional 22,835 shares sold on March 25.



Despite the sales, ARKK continued to invest in several of its key holdings. 10x Genomics (NASDAQ: TXG) saw multiple purchases throughout the week, with 53,886 shares added on March 25, 91,659 shares on March 26, and 26,811 shares on March 27.

3 cryptocurrencies to avoid trading next week


One fundamental economic aspect of cryptocurrencies that can drastically impact their price is the circulating supply inflation. When previously non-existent or locked coins are issued or unlocked, they increase their supply, which affects the trading value.
Usually, savvy cryptocurrency traders and investors consider the supply and demand dynamics to make profitable decisions and manage their risks.
On that note, Finbold encountered three cryptocurrencies with scheduled token unlocks to avoid trading next week. These three projects will unlock $232 million out of $270.58 million worth of tokens in the following seven days.

dYdX Protocol (DYDX)
The decentralized exchange protocol DYDX is again featured among cryptocurrencies to avoid trading due to its unlocks. Finbold reported a similar warning for February 29, with 33.34 million tokens unlocked – worth $130 million at that time.
Now, the protocol will put the same amount of DYDX in circulation on March 31, currently worth $117.33 million. This represents a nearly 10% loss in the month-over-month price of this DeFi cryptocurrency.
As for the distribution, early investors will receive the most of the unlocks, worth $65.07 million by press time. The team will have $35.83 million worth of DYDX to sell in the following weeks, and a reserve for future employees will take the rest, worth $16.43 million.

Sui Network (SUI)
Sui Network (SUI) is another cryptocurrency to avoid trading next week with a token unlock set to March 30. Specifically, the protocol will release 4 million SUI to the community reserve, for a value of $7.88 million.
However, TokenUnlocks.App registers a total unlock of $76.07 million worth of tokens, which are not fully disclosed in the platform’s distribution branch.

Echelon Prime (PRIME)
Finally, Echelon Prime (PRIME) will unlock $38.58 million worth of 1.66 million PRIME also on March 30. 912,040 PRIME will go to the Parallel Studios reserve and 750,000 to its private investors.
Thus, the Web3 gaming studio native token is another cryptocurrency to avoid trading next week due to expected sell-off volatility.
PRIME token unlocks on March 30. Source: TokenUnlocks.App
Nevertheless, increasing a token’s supply does not guarantee that its price will fall. If the asset manages to acquire a higher demand in the meantime, its value could still increase under these circumstances. 
Yet, traders will try to speculate on the economic effects these unlocks will have on price, which could bring increased volatility and worsen the potential risk-reward ratio. The market is uncertain and influenced by multiple factors, requiring proper risk management and learning when to avoid trading specific cryptocurrencies.

Sam Bankman-Fried gets 25 years. What happens now?

A federal judge sentenced former FTX CEO Sam “SBF” Bankman-Fried to 25 years behind bars for his multiple felony convictions, eliciting mixed reactions from many in and out of the crypto space.On March 28, Judge Lewis Kaplan had some harsh words for Bankman-Fried before and after announcing consecutive sentences of 240 months and 60 months, totaling 25 years in prison. The judge compared SBF to a “thief,” said his attempts to promote regulation of crypto was “an act,” found he committed perjury and was “willing to flip a coin as to the continued existence of life on earth.”How long and where will Sam Bankman-Fried be in prison?The former FTX CEO has been held at the Metropolitan Detention Center in Brooklyn since August 2023, when Judge Kaplan revoked his bail for intimidating witnesses in the criminal case. A March 28 docket entry for U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York suggested the judge would deduct time already spent in jail, meaning SBF would have a maximum of 291 months in prison — ending in 2048.According to Judge Kaplan, Bankman-Fried will serve the remainder of his time behind bars at a medium- or low-security prison in the San Francisco Bay Area. Reports suggested possible locations, including the Federal Correctional Institution (FCI) Herlong and FCI Mendota. It was unclear which one would house the former FTX CEO at the time of publication.Many reactions from social media following the March 28 hearing expressed doubt that Bankman-Fried would serve the entire sentence length. According to U.S. law, parole is no longer available for those sentenced to federal charges. However, inmates judged to have “good conduct” can receive 54 days off their sentence for each year served. In Bankman-Fried’s case, that would mean a reduction of roughly 3.75 years: 21.25 years served in total and less than 21 years after sentencing — presumably ending in 2045. The former CEO, now 32 years old, could be in his mid-50s even if he is released early for good behavior. Appealing the convictionBefore Judge Kaplan announced the 25-year sentence, Bankman-Fried attorney Marc Mukasey said his team intended to appeal the jury’s decision. The lawyers have 14 days to file the paperwork in court. Many from the crypto space suggested that 25 years in prison was “too light” for Bankman-Fried, given the impact on FTX users. However, some seemed to be surprised at the sentencing hearing, “I say this would apply to [Alex] Mashinsky as well: I hope that neither actually have to be in prison until the day they literally die,” said crypto influencer Tiffany Fong, who has provided many exclusives related to SBF’s case. “I personally wouldn’t have supported a 40- to 50-year sentence because I think that would basically be a life sentence for someone who’s 32 years old.”Source: Tiffany FongRelated: SBF memecoins pump and dump as FTX founder gets 25-year prison sentence“That is an insanely lengthy prison sentence, and I’m not quite sure that he needs to be in prison for a quarter century,” said Ana Kasparian, a host on progressive media outlet The Young Turks. “25 years… I feel like that is the kind of prison sentence that you would save, or you would implement, toward a violent criminal who’s a threat to the public.” What about the money?The FTX bankruptcy case is ongoing in the District of Delaware, where debtors have submitted a possible plan to repay users based on prices at the time of the exchange’s collapse. Judge Kaplan also handed down an $11-billion forfeiture judgment as part of Bankman-Fried’s criminal case. “This forfeiture is designed to make certain that if SBF ever makes money, it goes not to him but to the government and the victims,” said former federal prosecutor Mitchell Epner, according to a March 29 CNN report. “He will never be able to accumulate funds in his life, and forfeiture cannot be eliminated through bankruptcy.” Epner’s statement suggested that should Bankman-Fried start a successful business making millions of dollars after his release, the government could go after these funds. The same could apply to a sudden windfall, making it less likely SBF will ever achieve the same financial status he had before November 2022.Magazine: ‘Less flashy’ Mashinsky set for less jail time than SBF: Inner City Press, X Hall of Flame

                        Solana Price PredictionSolana price is riding a wave of upward momentum, nearly touching the $200 mark with its current steady stance in the $180-$190 bracket. The 60% monthly surge in SOL’s price is partly driven by the buzz around meme coins such as Dogwifhat (WIF), BONK, SLERF, and Book of Meme (BOME), spotlighting the Solana network and sparking robust investment flows. Concurrently, Solana’s DeFi sector growth and ecosystem solidity are bolstering investor trust, encouraging long-term holding over quick profit-taking in anticipation of further gains.Solana’s DeFi Ecosystem Thrives, Pushing TVL Near $5 Billion
Solana’s decentralized finance (DeFi) sector is thriving, with its Total Value Locked (TVL) nearing $5 billion, a peak not seen since February 2022.This growth highlights the rising confidence and engagement in Solana’s DeFi platforms, reflecting a robust trust in its financial ecosystem.
Solana’s DeFi TVL’s surge to almost $5 billion underlines increased investment.
Despite market fluctuations, the growing TVL indicates sustained investor interest in Solana’s DeFi.
This uptrend suggests potential long-term value growth for Solana’s native token, SOL, as it becomes a preferred choice for DeFi activities.

Litecoin Price Spikes After CFTC Calls It Commodity Alongside Bitcoin and Ethereum - Decrypt

Meme coin lovers may be having a great month, but Litecoin (LTC) hodlers are celebrating today with their coin taking the spot as the second best-performing cryptocurrency in the top 100, with a bullish performance in the last 24 hours that saw its price spike nearly 11%.This comes on the fifth day of relatively slow markets, with Bitcoin and Ethereum correcting by less than 2% in the same period. The global cryptocurrency market cap today sits at $2.79 trillion, marking a mere -0.1% change in the last 24 hours.The most significant non-technical event contributing to Litecoin's spike is a recent statement by the United States Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC). In a lawsuit against crypto exchange KuCoin, the CFTC declared Litecoin a commodity. This statement is crucial as it places Litecoin outside the scope of the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), which regulates securities and imposes stricter responsibilities on coin issuers.“KuCoin solicited and accepted orders, accepted property to margin, and operated a facility for the trading of futures, swaps, and leveraged, margined, or financed retail transactions involving digital assets that are commodities including Bitcoin (BTC), Ether (ETH), and Litecoin (LTC),” the complaint reads.Being declared a commodity potentially opens the door for more comfortable endorsements and further integrations for Litecoin, with less fear of the SEC attempting enforcement actions.Litecoin started the day at $94.80 and traded sideways until 6am UTC, when bulls took over the markets and spiked the coin to its daily high of $106 before correcting slightly to its current mark of $104.99. The coin is up 11.56% in the last 24 hours and 21.71% in the last week, plus 27.5% in the last 30 days. Friday marks the second best performing day of the year for LTC, only behind an 18.7% spike on March 11.On the technical side, Litecoin was trading sideways during January and February, bouncing in a horizontal channel between $63 and $77. The coin broke its channel on February 29 and started a bullish trend on March 1. Most of the positive performance registered in 2024 has been due to March's positive results. Since the bottom of the channel to today's high, there has been a roughly 63% spike.Image: TradingviewPast data shows that many of the unusually large candlesticks are followed by a correction of many small-bodied candlesticks in the days after. Litecoin failed to break past the resistance set by March 11's spike, which could point to a possible cup-and-handle pattern: A big spike followed by a symmetrical period of a correction, and a recovery that cancels all the losses almost in a semi-circle shape. If this is the case, there should be a smaller correction followed by a similar recovery before a bullish breakout.Overall, the coin looks bullish and healthy in a longer timeframe. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) shows that the coin is slightly overbought with a 66% dominance of bulls over bears, with Litecoin proving its bullishness after bouncing from its Exponential Moving Average (EMA) 55 and going back again to trade on top of the EMA 10.Image: TradingviewGiven that the coin is bullish in charts set at 24 hour candlesticks and in weekly candlesticks for the first time since June of 2023, an immediate resistance could be around $115 for a 10% gain. If it remains strongly bullish, the next one appears to be near $135 for a nearly 29% gain. However, if it fails to meet expectations and corrects down, it could drop somewhere near the $80 price line for a -22.5% loss.Edited by Andrew HaywardDisclaimerThe views and opinions expressed by the author are for informational purposes only and do not constitute financial, investment, or other advice.Stay on top of crypto news, get daily updates in your inbox.

Ethereum Founder Thinks Meme Coins Can Be More Than Fun, Simple Tokens


																Vitalik Buterin, the co-founder of the Ethereum network, believes meme coins can become higher quality projects that contribute positively to the crypto ecosystem and the world around them, squashing the narrative that such tokens are useless, racist, and sexist.
According to a new report titled “What Else Could Meme Coins Be?,” Buterin looks forward to seeing meme coin projects that support public goods instead of enriching insiders and creators. He urged creators to make games instead of just tokens.
Meme Coins Can Be More
The Ethereum founder cited a report he wrote ten years ago and published on Bitcoin Magazine, which addressed the role cryptocurrencies could play in funding important public projects like cancer research and saving the environment. He explained at the time that society needed new ways to fund valuable large-scale projects other than markets and institutions, and issuing new coins could fill in the gaps.
People who wanted to support cancer research could hold and trade AntiCancerCoin, while those passionate about saving the environment could use ClimateCoin. These assets would determine which projects get funded, creating long-lasting and positive tokens that are different from what meme coins have become today.
Buterin explained that people participate in meme coin projects because they feel they are democratic and open for anyone, they are fun, and the value of the tokens may increase. He suggested that the crypto community could use a large percentage of a meme coin’s supply to support valuable public causes, but that could happen at the expense of the token’s worth and democracy.




So, the remedy would be to create gaming projects that are democratic, meaningful, fun, and have the tendency to rise in value.
“Don’t just make a coin, make a game. But make an actually meaningful and fun game. Don’t think Candy Crush on the blockchain; think World of Warcraft on the blockchain,” the Ethereum founder stated.
Creating Interesting Games
Furthermore, the computer programmer insisted that if the goal of creating meme coins and related games is to satisfy people’s desire to have fun, then developers should stop making simple copy-and-paste coins. He urged owners of these projects to make the games more complicated and interesting.
Using blockchain gaming platform Axie Infinity as an example, Buterin commended how well the entity had improved the quality of its projects since its boom in 2021.

Tesla and Two Other Stocks Trading at 52-Week Lows that Can Rebound Strongly - Tokenist


					
Neither the author, Tim Fries, nor this website, The Tokenist, provide financial advice. Please consult our website policy prior to making financial decisions.



On Thursday, Sam Bankman-Fried was sentenced to 25 years in prison for one of the largest fraudulent financial schemes. When the FTX exchange collapsed at the end of 2022, he generated enormous fear, uncertainty, and doubt (FUD), crashing the entire crypto market.



At times like that, investors make fortunes. Those stuck to their fundamental analysis bought Bitcoin and altcoins at steep discounts. That decision positioned them to have over 4x gains in the present. 



Similarly, certain stocks have had a suppressed price, leading to near 52-week lows. Which stocks tick the fundamental box but are yet to rebound?



Tesla (NASDAQ: TSLA)



For the last 52 weeks, Tesla’s average stock price settled at $222.78 per share. This is 46% lower than TSLA’s all-time high of $409 in November 2021. Presently at $175, TSLA shares have gone down nearly 30% year-to-date, with another downward spike looking to revisit the yearly low of $153 per share.



There are many reasons to be both bullish and bearish. On one hand, TSLA stock has a higher market cap than Toyota (TM) and Ford Motor (F) combined. This suggests that investors are betting on the future of EVs rather than the present production of cars. 



Moreover, after acquiring Twitter for $44 billion, Elon Musk exposed himself to political vulnerability as the only major social media platform not controlled by the total state. Investors could also say that Tesla’s position in China continues to erode amid multiple EV newcomers like Li Auto.



On the other hand, it remains true that no Western EV company managed to popularize EVs as much as Tesla. More importantly, to scale EV production and lithium battery supply chain and gather data for self-driving capability. After all, Tesla’s EV dominance is demonstrated by the company’s charging standardization, becoming the North American Charging Standard (NACS).



Although EV adoption faces affordability hurdles and resale value, Tesla’s codenamed “Redwood” in 2025, at $25,000, will be a major milestone. Likewise, there is no sign that governments’ push towards a net-zero agenda is waning. Ahead of this inevitability, Tesla increased its year-over-year cash flow by 45% in Q4 2023, to $2 billion. 



Twelve months ahead, 32 analysts pulled by Nasdaq view the average TSLA price target at $198.72 vs the current $175 per share.





Philip Morris International (NASDAQ: PM)



For the last 52 weeks, the average Philip Morris (PM) stock price has been $94.04 per share. This is 5% lower than PM’s all-time high of $99.04 in February 2022. Presently, at $91.62, it is 4.8% from its yearly low of $87.23.



This is a stable range, which is not surprising given PM’s status as both a wide-moat and dividend stock. Even though the company is shifting to smokeless products, Philip Morris can still tap into a recurrent revenue stream of 1.3 billion global smokers. Much like Nvidia dominates the data center supply for generative AI, Philip Morris has an international market hold of 28%.



Given new investments to follow new smokeless trends, in the 2023 annual report, the company reported a 14.8% decline in operating cash flow to $9.2 billion. However, its earnings per share and operating net income have increased at 11% and 3.7%, respectively. 



Philip Morris offers a 5.68% dividend yield at a $5.20 per share annual payout. Twelve months ahead, 16 analysts pulled by Nasdaq position the average PM price target at $101.94 vs the current $91.62 per share.







GameStop Corporation (NASDAQ: GME)



Following the successful launch of Reddit (RDDT), there has been a resurgence of memetic energy. Thanks to social media coordination, the gaming retail chain was the main beneficiary of the trading phenomenon, alongside AMC Entertainment and other minor stocks. 



For the last 52 weeks, the average GameStop (GME) share price has been $17.89. This is 30% lower than its present price of $12.52 but very close to its 52-week low of $11.82. The company delivered mixed results on GameStop’s road toward a digital marketplace.



On Tuesday, GameStop’s Q4 2023 earnings report revealed a $6.7 million net income for the full year, significantly improving from the $313.1 million net loss in 2022. However, GameStop’s net sales are down 19% from the year prior at $1.8 billion. As a result, its earnings per share failed to beat the consensus of $0.25 at $0.22 reported.



Yet, the weekly dip of 9% may invite meme traders to elevate GME above the yearly low. Unlike the other two stocks, GME is on the pumpamentals spectrum rather than fundamentals for now.



What is your preferred vehicle for asset speculation, such as altcoins without earnings or meme stocks? Let us know in the comments below.

Why the Bitcoin Price Should Reach $150,000 by 2025, Explains Morgan Creek Capital Management CEO | Cryptoglobe


                                
In an appearance on CNBC’s “Fast Money” on March 28, Mark Yusko, the founder and CEO of Morgan Creek Capital Management, shared his thoughts on the cryptocurrency market. 



Yusko’s forecast for Bitcoin is notably bullish, predicting a potential rise to $150,000 within the next year. This projection is underpinned by a mathematical model that applies Metcalfe’s Law to determine a fair current value of around $50,000 for Bitcoin. With the imminent halving event (expected around April 20, 2024), which will reduce the reward for mining new blocks, Yusko anticipates an adjustment in Bitcoin’s fair value. He says that unique to this cycle is the additional transaction fees from ordinals and inscriptions, suggesting a post-halving fair value adjustment to $75,000. Yusko believes that historical patterns post-halving indicate a surge in interest and investment, potentially driving the price to double its fair value, culminating in the $150,000 target.



According to a report by The Daily Hodl, he said:



“So we look at the fair value today from the Metcalfe’s Law model… that gives us around $50,000. The halving occurs in three weeks. What a halving does is it cuts the block rewards, the amount of money that’s given to the miners to secure the network. If those rewards were to get cut in half, as they do, many of the miners would struggle. So historically what has happened? The price rises, the fair value rises. So that would push it to $100,000.







            
            

            
            

            
            

        

“But this time it’s a little different in that instead of just block rewards, we get transaction fees because of ordinals and inscriptions. So let’s say the fair value only goes to $75,000 this time. Then post-halving you get a lot of interest in the asset, a lot of people FOMO (fear of missing out) in and we normally go to about two times fair value in the cycle … So in the last cycle fair value was $30,000, we got to as high as $69,000. This time, I think probably two times because there’s less leverage. So that gets us to $150,000.“



Yusko elaborates on the mechanics expected to fuel this price surge. According to Yusko, the upcoming halving will slash the daily supply of new coins from 900 to 450, concurrently with an anticipated increase in demand, partially driven by the US-listed spot Bitcoin ETFs. This imbalance between supply and demand is projected to escalate the price. Yusko envisions a more exponential growth towards the end of the year, with historical trends suggesting a peak around nine months post-halving, likely aligning with the holiday season.



While Bitcoin remains the focal point of Yusko’s analysis, he also delves into other aspects of the crypto ecosystem. He mentions the impact of regulatory challenges on the market and highlights his interest in mining companies and chip makers like AMD and Nvidia. Despite high valuations in these areas, Yusko sees significant potential.



At Morgan Creek Digital, the emphasis is on investing in private companies within the crypto sector, with liquid tokens comprising a smaller portion of their portfolio. Beyond Bitcoin, Yusko is optimistic about the prospects of Ethereum, Solana, and Avalanche, among others. Despite Bitcoin’s dominance and its characterization as a superior form of digital gold, he believes in the exponential growth potential of smaller projects.



Yusko reveals Morgan Creek Digital’s approach to investment in the crypto space, aligning more with a venture capital model than active trading. Their strategy predominantly involves long-term holding, though they strategically exit positions in response to specific developments, as seen in their handling of Solana and Coinbase stock.

Russia Plans to Enter PC Gaming Handheld Market

Russian President Vladimir Putin has approved plans to enter Russia into the PC gaming handheld market, which has had very good development and was started by the units, for example, Steam Deck.Putin’s directive sparks interestAt a recent session presided over by President Putin on the social-economic advancement of the Kaliningrad region, the meeting’s proceedings revealed that one of the OK’ed directives comprised the manufacture of “portable gaming devices and gaming consoles”. The instruction, secretly captured by the Telegraphic Team and published online, clearly implies Russia’s desire to explore the business of gaming devices. Translation programs do not translate that instruction immaculately. The software version of that instruction highlights the importation of the production of land-based and portable game consoles and the development of its operating system and cloud software through which the delivery of games and programs to users will be made.Premier Mishustin of the people has been responsible for planning the portable gaming device. Directly citing Kommersant’s News, VK, a Russian tech company, may fulfill the project. While the GS Group, a South Korean global company, is responsible for production, the devices in question could be created.The projected console is anticipated to carry its own operating system and cloud system instead, such as the Steam Deck and Steel OS. At the same time, Kommersant is skeptical about the actionability of this process because Russia’s market is not competent in manufacturing consoles like PlayStation or Xbox. As per the news, building such a machine from scratch gram could last for up to 10 years, according to the newspaper.Market dynamics and potentialThe news from Russia arrives in the wake of a significant boom in demand for PC gaming handhelds, which has been detected by the booming market driven by devices like Steam Deck. This is evident because the Zephyrus ROG from Asus and the Legion Go from Lenovo have already entered the scene, which has indeed given the competitive landscape of portable gaming a tough time to compete. Though the details are yet to be public, the plan for the device has an appeal that has given the market spectators something to discuss in the meantime.The option of Russia launching personal computers for handheld games in the market may claim another turf in a competitive and ever-dynamic industry. Discussions on the prospect of a hypothetical Microsoft handheld console by lead analysts such as Phil Spencer do not need explanations because it’s already obvious that the space for portable gaming is evolving rapidly. With mobile gamers always chasing the elusive gaming experience on a portable device, vendors strive to make the most of this demand. It is not clear whether the Russia-originated game will reach its goals. Still, no matter its result, the fact that Russia created it is a sign of new technological discovery in the expanding universe of digital gaming.As led by the Russian projects to gear up the development of the new gaming handheld, the category [of] portable games on the rise is tipped for more supplication. Competing in this global market is currently a challenge for companies that intend to penetrate these rapidly growing markets, and innovation and competition power the whole industry to move forward. Even though the hard part of the nature of the mission, its schedule, is unclear, one thing is for sure: the brewing rise of portable gaming devices fueled by serious investment. With the advancement of everyday processing capability, the means will be explored to see how the new kid on the block will print the future of handheld gaming.

Mixed reactions: Google's move into cryptocurrency monitoring

Google recently made a breakthrough by expanding its search capability to monitor wallet balances across various blockchains, thus enabling Google users to effortlessly track their cryptocurrencies using the search engine. The enhancement includes popular blockchains like Bitcoin, Arbitrum, Avalanche, Optimism, Polygon, and Fantom and accommodates various cryptocurrency users. Google’s upgraded search capability enables such users to enter wallet addresses and receive a series of common search results showing the token balance per network, with a timestamp that indicates the time the data was last updated. The development eliminates the need for the user to navigate across multiple platforms to monitor their cryptocurrencies, thus lowering the barrier and streamlining the transaction of digital assets.Moreover, Google’s updated search feature supports three Bitcoin address formats: P2PKH, P2SH, and Bech32. As discussed earlier in this post, this development allows users to quickly check the current balance and recent transactions for Bitcoin addresses from Google, further simplifying the monitoring of Bitcoin activity from within the Google platform. On the one hand, the initiative was met with praise, with some commentators arguing that it is an essential step forward in assimilating Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies into the broader user experience. On the other hand, several concerns about massive, centralized data collection continued to be voiced, especially among privacy-focused Bitcoin proponents.Google’s evolution in embracing cryptocurrenciesGoogle’s development of such cryptocurrency-related products represents a significant shift from the platform’s earlier disclosure of digital assets. For instance, in 2018, the platform explicitly banned advertising anything related to Bitcoins. Nonetheless, following the approval of spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds in the United States in November of that year, Google displayed advertisements for ETF products from major asset managers like BlackRock. More strategically, Google discerned a cooperation agreement with Coinbase in October 2022 and publicized that the company’s customers may pay for Google Cloud facilities using cryptocurrencies.Support for Ethereum and DeFiSupport for Ethereum and DeFi Google’s recent growth is in line with its launch of Ethereum Name Service (ENS) domain search results, which simplifies the process for users to keep track of their Ethereum holdings by allowing them to check wallet balances using readable domain names like “vitalik.eth.” Additionally, Google Cloud partnered with Web3 startup Orderly Network in 2023 to create user-centric developer tools for Decentralized finance (DeFi), addressing long-standing entry barriers and security concerns within the DeFi ecosystem. This partnership demonstrates Google’s dedication to aiding creative initiatives in the cryptocurrency space.

Dogwifhat climbs to third in memecoin market cap


Dogwifhat (WIF), a memecoin based on the Solana blockchain, has claimed the third spot in market capitalization rankings among memecoins.
WIF now has a market cap of US$4 billion, trailing Dogecoin and Shiba Inu, valued at over US$30 billion and US$18 billion, respectively.
WIF traded at US$4.13 at 2:45 p.m. ET, a record high, according to CoinGecko data. 
WIF took the frog-themed currency Pepe’s position to rank third among memecoins, making the top three slots now occupied by dog-themed projects.



Memecoins as a category saw a 27% increase over the past week, with Dogwifhat recording an 84% surge in this timeframe.
However, the meme frenzy is not without its risks, as highlighted by the recent spike in presale scams on the Solana blockchain. 
Crypto detective ZachXBT has brought attention to several presale coins that have raised red flags for potential fraudulent activities.

BNB’s 12% weekly surge: peaking or just getting started?

BNB (BNB) saw a 12% increase in value over the seven days leading up to March 29, reaching a nearly two-week high of $620. This surge narrowed the valuation gap with its main competitor, Ether (ETH), which posted a 5% gain during the same timeframe. However, mixed signals from on-chain BNB Chain data suggest that the rally may have stretched too far.Impact from spot Bitcoin ETF flows and DeFi momentum on BNB’s priceMarket analysts note that the cryptocurrency market’s upward trend is closely linked to inflows into spot Bitcoin (BTC) exchange-traded funds (ETFs), which experienced a setback in the week ending March 23. For the first time since the introduction of spot ETFs in January, these financial instruments saw a net outflow of $890 million. On a positive note, recent figures indicate a significant decrease in outflows from Grayscale GBTC fund, with only $104 million leaving the fund on March 28.In the first half of March, BNB’s price soared by 61.7%, but this momentum reversed after reaching a peak of $645, corresponding to a market capitalization of $96.4 billion. For context, BNB hit an all-time high valuation of $116 billion in November 2021. Interestingly, the total value locked (TVL) on BNB Chain, which represents the total deposits in the network’s smart contracts, was $15.7 billion at that peak but has since fallen to just $7.1 billion, a 55% reduction.It's important to recognize that the entire crypto market, particularly decentralized finance (DeFi), has contracted significantly since late 2021. Therefore, it’s somewhat unfair to single out the decline in BNB Chain’s TVL. For example, the total market data for all blockchains tracked by DefiLlama, which once reached nearly $205 billion, now stands at $155 billion, marking a 25% decrease.Hence, a detailed examination of BNB Chain’s TVL, especially in comparison with direct competitors like Ethereum and Solana (SOL), is warranted. BNB Chain’s smart contract deposits have fallen to their lowest since March 2021, down 10% over two months, in stark contrast to Ethereum’s 8% TVL increase in ETH terms and Solana’s TVL, which jumped 29% since Jan. 28, as reported by DefiLlama.BNB Chain’s activity looks promisingTVL should not be the sole indicator of a blockchain’s success. Many decentralized applications (DApps), including nonfungible token (NFT) marketplaces, games, decentralized bets, collectibles, and social networks, do not require substantial deposits. In the past week alone, nearly 2 million active addresses were engaging with DApps on the BNB Chain.Top blockchains ranked by 7-day DApps volume. Source: DappRadarBNB Chain’s activity levels rival those of Ethereum’s most active layer-2 networks, boasting a comparable number of active addresses. Notably, despite Solana’s active addresses being 14% higher during the same timeframe, no blockchain other than Ethereum approaches the seven-day trading volume of BNB Chain, which stands at $12.4 billion. Moreover, while Solana and Ethereum saw their volumes decrease, BNB Chain's trading volume experienced an 11% uptick.Forecasting future trends in the cryptocurrency sector presents considerable challenges. A more reliable approach involves examining derivative metrics, such as the demand for leverage in BNB perpetual futures contracts, which serves as an indicator of market demand. A key metric to consider is the funding rate: a positive funding rate indicates a tendency among traders to apply leverage to their long positions.Related: Bitcoin to attract $1T from institutions amid ‘raging bull market’ — Bitwise execBNB perpetual futures 8-hour funding rate. Source: CoinglassThe latest figures show that the demand for leveraged long positions has leveled off, with the 8-hour funding rate holding steady at around 0.03%, or about 0.6% weekly. Usually, when traders feel positive about the market, this rate can climb above 1.2% per week. So, despite BNB’s price struggle with the $620 level, market sentiment remains optimistic.This article is for general information purposes and is not intended to be and should not be taken as legal or investment advice.

Vitalik Buterin Sees Value in Meme Coins: Looking Past the Hype - DailyCoin


        
Meme coins have held user appeal for fun and community despite their volatility and criticism.



Vitalik Buterin has explored the possibility of “good meme coins” that contribute positively to causes.



Buterin has suggested a more critical approach for users to find meme coins aligned with their values.
The cryptocurrency space continues to be a hotbed of innovation, with new projects and trends emerging constantly. One such trend, meme coins, has garnered significant attention in recent years, with Dogecoin’s meteoric rise in 2021 being a prime example. Can Meme Coins Be Good for Crypto?These meme coins, often inspired by internet jokes and featuring little to no underlying utility, have also faced criticism for their volatility, lack of innovation, and even offensive content. Vitalik Buterin, the co-founder of Ethereum, the world’s second-largest blockchain network, has finally shared his thoughts on the ongoing meme coin frenzy. While acknowledging the potential downsides, Buterin also recognizes the appeal of meme coins. He highlights the “fun” aspect that attracts users and the sense of community and accessibility they often provide. Buterin doesn’t shy away from the negative aspects. 
He points to the prevalence of “rug pulls,” where developers abandon a project after an initial pump in price, leaving investors with worthless tokens. Additionally, some recent meme coins on the Solana network have been slammed for containing offensive content.However, Buterin doesn’t advocate simply dismissing the entire meme coin phenomenon.  Instead, he ponders the possibility of “good meme coins” that contribute positively to the ecosystem. He cites examples like “GiveWell Inu,” which donated to a charity evaluator, and “Fable of the Dragon Tyrant,” which supports anti-aging research projects.  Vitalik Buterin on Value and CommunityEven the highly popular Dogelon Mars falls into this category, with Buterin’s own donation to a longevity research foundation fostering a strong connection between the two communities. Buterin acknowledges the limitations of charitable meme coins.
The core appeal of meme coins lies in potential price appreciation, accessibility, and entertainment value. Donating a large portion of a coin’s supply to charity could undermine these factors.Looking forward, Buterin suggests a more nuanced approach. He encourages users to find meme coin communities that align with their values and personalize their experience within the meme coin space. This, he argues, proves more effective than a blanket rejection of the entire trend, which may push people away and hinder the potential for positive change.On the Flipside
Social media hype and celebrity endorsements can inflate meme coin prices, creating bubbles vulnerable to crashes and hurting investors.



Rug pulls and other scams are unfortunately common in the meme coin space, leading to significant investor losses.
Why This MattersVitalik Buterin’s balanced perspective on meme coins offers a crucial step towards responsible participation in this sector.

Bitcoin Cash Up 55%: What's Behind Unlikely Comeback? - DailyCoin


        
Bitcoin Cash surges in price.



Several factors are behind the renewed interest.



Roger Ver maintains that BCH is the true Bitcoin.
Bitcoin Cash (BCH) was on the brink of obscurity, steadily dropping in the crypto market cap rankings. But a remarkable turnaround began in mid-February, culminating in a staggering 55% gain over the past week. This surge has propelled BCH to a 123-week high, sparking renewed interest and speculation about its future.A Perfect Storm For Bitcoin CashBitcoin Cash has triggered renewed interest in recent weeks thanks to various factors, including the upcoming halving scheduled for April 3. This event will cut the current 6.25 BCH block reward to 3.125 BCH, reducing the new token issuance to impact supply dynamics. Halvings are generally seen as bullish drivers, with BCH’s recent boom likely due to pre-halving buying in anticipation of future price increases.Further stoking BCH interest is the scheduled launch of Bitcoin Cash futures contracts on Coinbase. Set for launch on April 1, this product will allow investors to speculate on BCH’s future price movements using leverage. 
Beyond investor sentiment, BCH’s underlying fundamentals are also strengthening. The network hash rate, which reflects the computing power underpinning the Bitcoin Cash blockchain, surged to 6.33 ETH/s on March 28, more than tripling from March 4’s 2.08 EH/s hash rate, suggesting miners have confidence in the network’s long-term viability.With confidence in Bitcoin Cash returning, Roger Ver has rekindled the debate on whether BCH is a more faithful representation of Bitcoin, as outlined in the whitepaper.Bitcoin Has Been Captured: VerWith Bitcoin Cash back in contention, Ver re-ignited the long-running rivalry with Bitcoin in a recent interview, saying BTC does not align with cypherpunk philosophy, nor is it anything like the system described in Satoshi Nakamoto’s whitepaper. 
Ver stated that in the early days of Bitcoin, he promoted self-sovereign principles such as “taxation is theft, and you should have control of your own money,” which he continues to believe in and promote to this day.However, taking BTC maximalist Michael Saylor as an example, Ver underscored the ideological divide between BCH and BTC by criticizing Saylor’s advocacy of compliance, which Ver sees as a betrayal of Bitcoin’s initial rebellious spirit.“We have Michael Saylor saying pay your taxes; we’re not going to replace the US dollar or euro. Just be a good boy and obey everything the government tells you to do, which is the exact opposite of the early days of Bitcoin,” stated Ver. BCH is better positioned to fulfill the original concept envisioned by Satoshi Nakamoto, according to Ver. On the Flipside
There is a growing narrative that BCH is the solution to CBDCs and state surveillance. 



With Craig Wright outed as not Satoshi Nakamoto and BSV’s future uncertain, the door opens for BCH to become the dominant peer-to-peer Bitcoin token.



BCH is down 98% against BTC since its ATH of 0.433 in November 2017.
Why This MattersBitcoin Cash’s resurgence reignites the debate on cryptocurrency’s core purpose, which BCH proponents see as upholding cypherpunk ideals and freeing individuals from centralized control. In contrast, BTC is heading towards compliance, setting a battleground for the future direction of digital assets. Read about allegations Roger Ver caused the collapse of CoinFLEX here:CoinFLEX Says Bitcoin Jesus’ $47 Million Loan Default Is Behind Withdrawal TroublesFind out why the UK High Court ordered a freeze on Craig Wright’s global assets here:Craig Wright Asset Freeze: Why UK Court Took Drastic Action

$236,000,000,000 in 'Improper Payments' Made by US Government in One Year, Exposing Material Weakness in Internal Controls: Report - The Daily Hodl


								The US government is botching hundreds of billions of dollars of payments per year, according to a new report.
The Government Accountability Office (GAO) says federal agencies made $236 billion in “improper payments” last year – a number that includes overpayments, inaccurate recordkeeping and fraud.










The agency says the wasteful and erroneous spending is a systemic issue showing a serious weakness in how the government manages money.
“Improper payments—those that should not have been made or were made in the incorrect amount—have consistently been a government-wide issue…
GAO has found that these payments represent a material deficiency or weakness in internal controls. 
Specifically, GAO has noted that the federal government is unable to determine the full extent of its improper payments or to reasonably assure that appropriate actions are taken to reduce them.”
Overpayments are the biggest issue by far, clocking in at $175.1 billion, followed by “unknown payments” at $44.6 billion.
Source: Government Accountability Office
The GAO says last year’s number represents an $11 billion decrease compared to 2022.
The agency has been tracking improper payments for 20 years and says the government has mishandled a staggering $2.7 trillion in payments in that time.
In 2023, 14 agencies reported improper payment estimates across 71 programs, with 79% of estimated improper payments concentrated in five areas:
• HHS’s Medicare, comprising three programs ($51 billion)
• HHS’s Medicaid ($50 billion)
• Department of Labor’s Unemployment Insurance – Federal Pandemic Unemployment Assistance ($44 billion)
• Department of the Treasury’s Earned Income Tax Credit ($22 billion)
• Small Business Administration’s (SBA) Paycheck Protection Program Loan Forgiveness ($19 billion)

Dogecoin Influencer Predicts When DOGE Payments Will Debut On X | Bitcoinist.com


								Dogecoin influencer, Mishaboar has predicted the timeline for Dogecoin’s native token, DOGE to be integrated into Elon Musk’s X Payments. The developer has highlighted key phases and plans that must be accomplished before cryptocurrency payments are potentially added on X.  
Developer Forecasts Dogecoin in X Payments Within 5 Years
In a recent X (formerly Twitter) post released on Thursday, March 28, Mishaboar forecasted the introduction of Dogecoin into X Payments in the coming years. The developer anticipates that Dogecoin payments could be potentially introduced into X within five years.

During discussions about forthcoming developments set for X Payments, Mishaboar addressed a member of the crypto community who suggested that the implementation of crypto payments into X may take up to five years. Countering the statement, Mishaboar expressed anticipation for the integration of crypto payments on X  “much earlier than that.” 
The Dogecoin developer has anchored his predictions on the growing adoption and approval of cryptocurrencies in global payment systems. According to Mishaboar, world-leading payment services like PayPal are already supporting cryptocurrencies, suggesting a strong possibility for X payments to follow suit and integrate cryptocurrencies in the near future. 
In projecting DOGE payments on X before five years, Mishaboar has also tempered expectations by predicting that the integration is unlikely to occur as early as next year. While these forecasts have further piqued the heightened anticipation within the crypto community, it’s important to note that they remain speculative. No official statements have been issued by Musk confirming the integration of Dogecoin or any other cryptocurrency into X Payments. 
Key Developmental Phases Set For X Payments
In his post, Mishaboar revealed that there were still several developments planned for X Payments before the project launches officially. The developer underscored a statement made by Musk last year, in which the SpaceX CEO indicated that the first phase of X Payments would focus on introducing fiat currencies, rather than cryptocurrencies. 

The crypto developer has stated that potentially introducing cryptocurrency into X Payments would be a step-by-step process, emphasizing the importance of obtaining key licenses and meeting regulatory requirements before launching a payments service on X.  
Recently, Musk disclosed that X Payments had secured money transmitter licenses across three regions in the United States. The Tesla CEO has noted that X is getting closer to winning another money transmitter license in California. Achieving this milestone would mark another significant step towards advancing the potential launch of X Payments.

SHIB's 10% surge: Can Shiba Inu flip AVAX to enter top 10 again? - AMBCrypto



If SHIB follows the same trend from the 1st of March, it could become number 10.
The sentiment around AVAX was negative compared to SHIB’s optimistic state.

Shiba Inu’s [SHIB] return to the top 10 fold might be closer if the token keeps up with its seven-day momentum. As of this writing, SHIB was 11th on the standings.
But a 10.36% hike within the last week suggested that SHIB can flip Avalanche’s [AVAX] $20.3 billion market cap.
Is it over for the red chain?
For AVAX, it has not been able to attract the same goodwill as Shiba Inu. When SHIB’s price increased, AMBCrypto observed that AVAX could not match up as its value fell by 3.35%.
However, price is not the only indicator suggesting a possible flipping. According to our analysis, other metrics like the Weighted Sentiment and Social Dominance implied the same.
At press time, on-chain data from Santiment showed that SHIB’s Social Dominance had increased to 1.675%. Evidence showed that a rising Social Dominance comes with a further price increase for the memecoin.
For example,  the metric started rising on the 1st of March. A few days later, it hit a month-long high, and it was around the same period that SHIB climbed to $0.000040.
Source: Santiment
If this trend repeats itself, then the price of Shiba Inu could increase. Should this be the case, the value could sustain an uptrend that sends it toward $0.000037.
Bulls think it’s SHIB’s time
SHIB’s Weighted Sentiment data showed a divergence from that of AVAX’s. The metric assesses the overall mood of the market toward a cryptocurrency.
At press time, SHIB’s sentiment had climbed to 0.586, indicating that market participants were bullish on the token. However, the reading was not at the greed level that could imply a potential reversal.
Therefore, a further price increase could be a reasonable option. In AVAX’s case, it was not the same, as the sentiment remained negative. A situation like this suggests that participants have pessimistic comments about the price action.
Hence, demand for the token might reduce which could also mean a price decline. If this trend with Shiba Inu and AVAX continues over the next few days, then SHIB might displace the latter from the 10th position.
Source: Santiment
However, AVAX might resist the flipping if fear gets extreme as this could fuel a rally for the token. Should the rally come before SHIB takes over the position, the aforementioned prediction could be invalidated.

Realistic or not, here’s SHIB’s market cap in AVAX terms

In addition, market participants might need to watch out for the buzzing narrative in the market. As of this writing, memecoins outperformed most of the top altcoins.
If this remains the same, the flipping might happen. However, if altcoins start to run, the projects might maintain their respective positions.

AI Revolutionizing Healthcare: Addressing Data Ambiguity | Cryptopolitan

The field of healthcare has been undergoing great changes with AI. AI promises to shorten the time and be more precise in the diagnosis, to bring customized treatment and achieve better patient outcomes. A Harvard School of Public Health report ascertains that AI can cut down treatment costs by up to 50% and boost health outcomes by as much as 40%. Hospital administrative frameworks can also be streamlined by AI, which serves as a bedside cheerful nurse throughout. AI’s health capabilities depend on the quality of their input data.Understanding data ambiguityData ambiguity presents problems such as uncertainties, incompleteness, or inconsistency in medical data that AI utilization and integration face. Data errors resulting from data collection or processing may imply an inaccurate decision or misunderstanding by AI algorithms when diagnosing or suggesting a treatment. However, if left misdiagnosing or misdirecting the treatment.The results of that are not only in healthcare but overall. Errors in diagnostics, which mainly result from interpretations by AI based on inadequate data, may slow down the application of necessary and correct treatments, thus threatening patient safety. Errors that arise from flawed or missing data in the care given can easily lead to a much worse reaction such as a serious treatment that will not heal the patient. Data ambiguity can simultaneously result in ethical and legal issues, which can adversely affect trust, possibly towards healthcare services and institutions.Addressing challengesTo identify solutions for the problem, an integrated strategy on meteorological data ambiguity is essential. It further means enhancing the data quality by applying strict collection and processing procedures and verifying the AI systems to let them work efficiently and accurately. All this will help build a framework of effective regulation and the rule of law, promoting patients’ sensitivity and transparency.Several programs and factions go into solving these difficulties. Cutting-edge data analytics techniques, both NLP (natural language processing) and AI (Artificial intelligence), are being used to explore relevant nuggets from diverse data sources and improve how doctors diagnose diseases and foresee patients’ treatments. FHIR may be just one of the many standardization efforts in this regard, and its objective will be to make data interoperability and sharing possible, breaking the barriers to AI integration.Transparent AI modelsCreating algorithms that provide clarity and will be accessible to healthcare practitioners and their patients is a key priority in this area. Instead, AI models serve as tools for clinical decision-makers to validate and explain AI-generated recommendations and enable complex reasoning that couldn’t be accomplished before.With the healthcare AI uprising becoming more real and apparent, the main concern is data ambiguity resolution, which holds the key to the full potential of AI in healthcare. Through data quality enhancement, AI system validation, and strong regulations and governance regulation, the healthcare sector can take advantage of all the AI power while protecting the patients from hazards, privacy, and others. On the back of teamwork and progressive advances, health care finds a bright future ahead of it, blazed by the trail of AI.

BlockDAG Puts Bitcoin Minetrix to Rest With Its $10.4M Presale Haul: Analysing MEMEAI Price Prediction for April 2024



                    
The crypto market is back up, with most major altcoins up on daily, monthly, and yearly charts. Not surprisingly, meme coins are leading the pack, with MEMEAI up by a staggering 1113.16% over the past month. MEMEAI price predictions suggest a continuation of the positive uptrend with a potential 226.39% rise by the end of April.



In the ICO market, BlockDAG (BDAG) and Bitcoin Minetrix presales are on the frontlines, dominating investor attention with highly successful presales and compelling 5000X ROI projections.




Bitcoin Minetrix Presale: An Innovation in DeFi



Bitcoin Minetrix (BTCMTX) presents an innovative decentralised platform for Bitcoin mining, eliminating the need for heavy energy consumption and expensive mining equipment.





By staking BTCMTX tokens, users gain mining credits that grant access to cloud mining hash power, offering an easy and accessible way to dive into Bitcoin mining. This inventive approach to BTC mining has captured significant interest, evidenced by a rapid sellout of the  Bitcoin Minetrix presale.



MEMEAI Price Prediction



Meme AI (MEMEAI) rose by a staggering 1113.16% over the past month, and the current Meme AI price prediction for 2024 suggests a potential rise of 226.39%, reaching $0.024654 by April 26, 2024.




Despite this optimistic forecast, the current sentiment around MEMEAI is bearish. Seventy-five percent of technical analysis indicators suggest bearish signals, and only 25% show bullish signs. Furthermore, over the last thirty days, Meme AI Coin had only 33% green days, showcasing considerable volatility.





BlockDAG – The Best Presale Crypto 2024



BlockDAG (BDAG) has firmly planted its flag in the crypto world after its keynote address debuted on the digital screens of Tokyo’s Shibuya Crossing. The address announced the project’s ambitious goals for 2024: reaching $600 million in presale funding and securing a spot among the top 50 cryptos on ranking platforms like Coinmarketcap and CoinGecko. The announcement has significantly amplified the project’s visibility, attracting a wave of investments into its presale that has already surpassed $10.4 million.



BlockDAG is not just aiming to join the crypto elites’ ranks but positioning itself as a formidable rival to industry stalwarts such as Bitcoin, Helium, and Kaspa. With predictions of a staggering 5000X return, BlockDAG presents an enticing prospect for investors. Early adopters purchasing BDAG coins at the current price of $0.003 could see an ROI of approximately 1566% when the project launches at $0.05, showcasing its immense potential for profitability.



Beyond its investment appeal, BlockDAG is committed to democratising crypto mining, making it more accessible to the general public. To this end, the project introduces a range of mining solutions catering to different expertise levels. From its advanced X-series mining rigs designed for dedicated miners to its convenient cloud mining service for those looking to invest in mining without the hardware, BlockDAG is lowering the barriers to entry into the crypto mining space. Additionally, its mining app, available on both the Apple Store and Google Play, brings mining capabilities to a broader audience, allowing users to participate in the crypto economy directly from their smartphones.






In response to the overwhelming early investor interest and the $10.4 million raised quickly, BlockDAG, currently priced at $0.003 in the fifth batch, has announced a $2 million mega giveaway for 50 lucky community members. Investors can participate in the giveaway by following BlockDAG’s social media channels, submitting their wallet addresses, increasing their winning chances by completing all quests, and inviting friends for additional entries.



In Summary



Meme AI (MEMEAI) has experienced a remarkable rise of 1113.16% over the past month, with MEMEAI price predictions suggesting a further increase of 226.39% by April 26, 2024, despite a predominantly bearish sentiment and high volatility in its market.



In the presale market, Bitcoin Minetrix (BTCMTX) and BlockDAG (BDAG) quickly garner interest with their rapid presale sellout. The BlockDAG (BDAG) project is especially noteworthy, having raised a whopping $10.4M and projecting an ROI of 1566% at launch.

Hackers Loot Ethereum-Based DeFi Protocol Prisma Finance for $11,600,000 Worth of Crypto: PeckShield - The Daily Hodl


								Bad actors have exploited decentralized finance (DeFi) protocol Prisma Finance and stole 3,257.69 Ethereum (ETH) worth $11.6 million, according to PeckShield.
The blockchain security and analytics firm flagged the suspicious activity after the hacker initially siphoned $8.1 million worth of funds from the platform.










The attacker eventually distributed the stolen assets to three wallets.
The team behind Prisma Finance acknowledged the security breach and says it is taking measures to prevent further losses.
“Following the exploit affecting a number of users’ individual vaults, Prisma Protocol has been paused by the emergency multisig and remaining funds are safe. mkUSD and ULTRA, as stablecoins, are overcollateralized and are not at risk.
We will continue to communicate through our official channels and are working to resolve this situation.
Due to the recent exploit, Prisma urges all users to revoke all connections to prevent loss of funds.  All users who connected their wallets to the platform are at risk of future fund loss.”
Prisma Finance says it is now conducting an investigation and will attempt to retrieve the stolen funds. The platform also warns users to be cautious of scams.
“During the next hours, be careful with phishing links of all sort. Trust only official communication channels please.”

VC Roundup: Investors move into cross-chain, Bitcoin layer-2, and institutional tools

Venture capital firms are moving to seize market share amid the current bull cycle. March’s developments include the acquisition of a quantitative trading firm, CFT Capital, by Web3-native investment company Borderless Capital.The move adds artificial intelligence and quant proprietary trading products to Borderless' businesses, targeting more efficiency in capital deployment across Web3 verticals, said the company with $600 million in assets under management. Borderless is an early investor in Algorand, Blockchdaemon and Securitize — the latter of which is BlackRock's new partner in a tokenized digital fund. The acquisition will also place Borderless in Latin America. “We are currently actively looking for Argentina, Uruguay, Brazil, Chile and Mexico,” Borderless’ co-founder and managing partner David Garcia told Cointelegraph.For 2024, the venture firm expects cross-chain standardization to be the next chapter in the evolution of the crypto space. “The advent of modularity in blockchains is a long-term trend, and we anticipate new L1s, L2s, and even L3s will emerge. [...] For mainstream adoption, we believe Web3 needs an aggregation layer that can interoperate across any chain,” Garcia said.According to Garcia, another key investment focus at Borderless is decentralized physical infrastructure (DePIN). “We strongly believe DePIN represents a new coordination and innovation paradigm across many diverse industries, including communication, distributed computation, mapping, and transportation.”In this edition of Cointelegraph’s VC Roundup, we feature startups that raised capital during the last weeks of March.Morph receives $20M in angel and seed fundingEthereum Virtual Machine (EVM) layer-2 Morph has raised $19 million in a seed round led by DragonFly Capital with additional participation from Pantera Capital, Foresight Ventures, The Spartan Group, MEXC Ventures, Symbolic Capital, Public Works, MH Ventures, Everyrealm. The firm raised an additional $1 million secured in an angel round. The company plans to use the capital toward talent acquisition, developer incentives, and marketing efforts. The blockchain is built on three pillars: decentralized sequencers, optimistic zkEVM integration, and modular design. “Being one of the first to launch with a decentralized sequencer on Ethereum is also an example of our commitment to decentralization from the beginning,” said Morph co-founder and chief operating officer Azeem Khan.FLock.io secures $6M seed round to decentralize AI trainingLondon-based Web3 decentralized AI startup FLock.io announced a $6 million Seed fundraising on March 28, co-led by Lightspeed Faction and Tagus Capital. The company aims to deploy its Federated Learning-powered Training Platform with the new funds, designed to decentralize AI agent training, fine-tuning, and inferencing while ending user data collection. “Now, anyone can contribute knowledge and enrich AI models themselves. The result? Community-owned models built by the many, not just the few, with data contributors being fairly rewarded and far more use cases,” said the startup in a statement. Source: FLock.ioKeyring Network raises $6M for digital assets compliance Keyring Network, founded by a former Nomura quant analyst and a J.P. Morgan investment banker in 2022, has secured $6 million in seed funding, co-led by gumi Cryptos Capital and Greenfield Capital, with additional support from Motier Ventures, Kima Ventures, UDHC Finance, Eberg Capital, and notable angel investors. The platform leverages zero-knowledge technology to address regulatory compliance and market liquidity for financial organizations, enabling private data sharing and identification of qualified participants for secondary market tokenized transactions. “Keyring’s asset-level solution is the most flexible ZK compliance tool catering to financial institutions’ individual DeFi risk appetite. Users can restrict themselves in terms of counterparty interactions, so they can be as conservative as they would like to,” noted Felix Machart, partner at Greenfield Capital. Rails secures $6.2M for self-custodial perpetuals exchangeCrypto perpetual exchange Rails has raised $6.2 million in a seed round led by Slow Ventures, Round13 Capital, CMCC Global, and Quantstamp. The exchange offers self-custody trading of perpetual contracts — a type of futures contract without an expiry date, allowing traders to better employ risk management strategies. The funds will be used to support the development of the platform, which uses smart contracts powered by zero-knowledge proofs. Rails was created as a result of the FTX collapse, said its co-founder Satraj Bramba in a statement. “In addition to getting rugged on FTX, the harder pill to swallow was the loss of the most efficient, productive trading environment we had ever used. [...] This massive gap in the market led to the creation of Rails.” Build on Bitcoin raises $10M seed round led by Castle Island VenturesHybrid layer-2 solution BOB, or “Build on Bitcoin,” has successfully raised $10 million in a seed funding round led by Castle Island Ventures with contributions from Mechanism Ventures, Bankless Ventures, CMS Ventures, UTXO Management, Asymmetric, Antalpha, Web3.com Ventures, BTC Frontier Fund, and Zeeprime. The funds are earmarked for launching the first Bitcoin layer-2 with Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) compatibility, designed to stimulate the onboarding of decentralized applications (DApps) on the Bitcoin network. BOB has also formed a strategic partnership with Anduro, a project by Marathon Digital, to collaborate on Alys, a Bitcoin layer-2 solution for institutions.RACE unveils $5M raise amid testnet launchTokenization platform RACE has disclosed a $5 million funding raise aimed at supporting its recently released testnet. The platform offers tokenization of assets such as aircraft, real estate, private credits, art, jewelry, and gold to accredited and institutional investors. RACE plans to build Decentralized Investment Committees (DICs) composed of industry experts who will perform due diligence on assets, including underwriting, legal services, asset custodianship, and financial analysis.

Apex Legends Competitive Scene Undergoes Massive Shake-Up with Removal of Dropship and Introduction of POI Draft

Professional play in the Apex Legends competitive scene isn’t new to controversies, with the most recent hack events undoubtedly leaving a trail often behind. The game company Electronic Arts (EA) revealed recently envisioned serious amendments in action for Apex Legends Global Series (ALGS) including the holding of the Dropship stage and the coming of Performance-Based POI Draft.The dropship departureEA took a decisive step to leave the Dropship mechanic in pro-game mode. The beginning of the match will consist of all teams appearing on the map at one of the 28 POIs, through either Skyfall or group spawn, instead of one team appearing from the sky at a time. This last turn from the tradition directs to drop randomness during Dropship lanes, so the cycle can be more controlled, keeping a strong strategy in match starts.Performance-based POI draftSimple but effective, this city revitalization plan heavily relies on the introduction of a Performance-Based POI Draft. It will be at the mercy of teams to spend the first-day draft doing the team landing locations in the Frontiers Cup and LAN events. This heptagonal political system will let teams draft by taking turns choosing their preference of positions (POI). This draft order must be given a performance-based weighting with LAN results and Regional Finals as criteria, thus ensuring that the best teams have an advantage in their final decisions regarding the pick order.Fairness and skill testingAccording to EA, the introduction of differentiation will bring about a level playing field and this type of fight will become a true test of skill for the fighters. In this way, the RNG factor that controls Drop shipping paths won’t count, and the skills of each player will be the resource to form a draft based on their performance. As a result, the competition is now more predictable and can be strategic. Moreover, EA will coordinate the draft with sporting sides as it is going to be held few weeks before the start of competitions to let sides choose their preferred POI and get enough time for practice.Implications for competitive playThe revelation of these changes has significantly impacted the community of Apex Legends, thereby generating talks over the possible effects that involve competitive strategies and team dynamics. However, the lack of the Dropship will force diverse adaptations, and remember to read carefully the map. It should also be noted that the incorporation of the POI draft system adds an extra level of complexity, which now demands from the teams a lot of thinking before they make their selection of the options based on the strengths and objectives.Rollout and community responseEA has scheduled the release of these changes alongside the July 2 Regular Season of the ALGS Year 4 Pro League. The community is now excited as these amendments are about to be completed to see what the competitive field will be. Though some of the players and teams would look at the evolution of the game as the chance for some cognitive revolution, others would rather look at it as the phase of difficulty and adaptation.A new Apex Legends competitive play season commencing soon will feature breaks from the past standards, as a Dropship is taken away and an advanced POI Draft system by Performance is introduced. As EA strives to build a more regulated and organized environment for intense gaming, the enthusiasts along with all the community members are impatiently waiting for the rollout of the changes and their actual effect on ALGS. The possibility of transforming the tactical, strategic, and skills-testing nature of Apex Legends eSports takes place and a new era in eSports is coming.

Revolutionizing Web Development: ChatGPT's "Screenshot to Code" Feature

One important step towards improving web development, OpenAI ChatGPT, is introducing a new approach, “Screenshot to Code, ” which can be implemented within the ChatGPT app store environment. This add-on has attracted considerable attention among the community of web designers who can now convert screenshots into executable code such as HTML and CSS.Streamlining Web developmentThe “Screenshot to Code” capability simplifies the web development process, especially for newbies in this field, where they can bookmark and open later with just one click, saving them time once they have enough skills and experience. The tool can be accessed more intuitively than before by navigating ChatGPT. Still, directly within it, users can upload a screenshot of the website layout they want to see a certain webpage coded and then start the process through the available tool in the GPT shop. Though the AI-powered mechanism is responsible for analyzing visual data, a quick generation of HTML and CSS code is also attributed.Automating the role “of ‘Screenshot to Code” streamlines the development process and makes it more accurate and effective, creating an end-product that satisfies the end-users. These simple and easy-to-understand steps enable individuals to concentrate on web design’s artistic or aesthetic traits so that they don’t have to worry about technical complexities, which ChatGPT can succinctly handle. The coded templates are uniquely suited to work with popular website builder applications from WordPress. This makes website building and on-the-go updating even more straightforward.Unleashing creative expressionThe easy implementation of this code enabled tailors without any prerequisite programming knowledge to take their creations professionally, thus bypassing the complex coding language learning curve. This innovation offers to express yourself and makes web innovation possible by creating a work environment that is open to all and easy for all to realize. Creating a screenshot from code symbolizes screenshot-to-code transcendence in a way humans have never experienced, which means digital technologies can be friendlier to users by including more options and making them more accessible.Alternatively, the ‘Screenshot to Code’ feature could be the most imaginative approach to tackle the complex issues of web development, but sometimes the consequences for the future are not sure. Although the code accuracy and quality over a longer performance period are being compared to faster and more efficient code quality performances, the analysis is still being processed. Fostering new relationships, learning new skills, and returning from the ensuing challenges will tell time. Whether this innovation paves the path out or we must encounter new challenges and depths we didn’t know would be revealed.Regarding ChatGPT’s impressive skills in OpenAI’s full development trail, one particular eastern application that brings tremendous value is the “Screenshot to Code.” AI will be able to run from the code generation into images, reducing the workload previously done by designers and thus improving the ease and creative work of web designers in making the site.On the other hand, no one can definitively say that the ultimate outlook of this new web technology on web development techniques is no one’s business. Being a trailblazer in the industry, ChatGPT’s mega-move is quite predictable as it is the pioneer behind the change in the web development phenomenon, and with time comes accessibility and innovativeness.

Bitcoin ETFs Rebound With $854 Million in Investments in One Week - Decrypt

Investors are again putting cash into Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) after a cool off last week. On Thursday, for the third consecutive day in a row, more than $100 million entered the popular new funds, data from BitMEX Research shows. The week got off to a slow start with only $1 million entering the funds on Monday. But things quickly picked up the next day with inflows of $418 million, BitMEX reports. Wednesday brought $243.4 million in inflows, and another $183 million was invested yesterday.U.S. markets are closed today for the Good Friday holiday.Last week, all the funds experienced outflows thanks to “investor hesitancy” following a dip in crypto prices. That reticence may have subsided. The most popular product remains BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT), which has the most assets under management of the nine funds, experiencing inflows of $17.7 billion.IBIT has been so popular that BlackRock CEO Larry Fink said in a Wednesday interview with Fox Business that he “would never have predicted” it would do so well with retail investors.The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) in January gave the green light to 11 Bitcoin ETFs after a decade of saying no to the products. The funds allow investors to buy shares that track the underlying price of the biggest cryptocurrency by market cap. Despite one of the funds, Grayscale’s GBTC, experiencing massive outflows as bankrupt crypto companies redeem shares and investors move to funds with lower fees, the other ETFs are experiencing huge inflows. As a result, Bitcoin has increased significantly since the approval of the ETFs on January 11: the asset is up nearly 50%. Bitcoin’s price currently stands at $69,618 per coin, according to CoinGecko. Edited by Ryan Ozawa.Stay on top of crypto news, get daily updates in your inbox.

Horizen’s Proof Verification Chain Goes Live on Testnet



Horizen, a public blockchain platform, announced that it achieved a major milestone with the launch of its proof verification chain on the testnet.

This launch is a notable event in the Web3 space since it is the first instance of a modular proof verification network.
The Objective of Horizen
Horizen revealed in a blog post that the goal of the testnet launch is to redefine blockchain efficiency with ZK proof verification and settlement layers. With this focus, prices for ZK rollup transactions and appchains are drastically reduced while efficiency is increased.




At its core, the new Horizen network comprises several critical components which include a revamped mainchain, proof submission interface, attestation mechanism, new Horizen smart contract, and Polygon zk-EVM rollup.
Driven by Substrate, the modular proof verification network is anchored by the Horizen mainchain. This network facilitates the exchange of ZEN, the native cryptocurrency of Horizen, as well as the validation of FFLONK Proofs produced by Polygon zkEVM instances.
With an eye toward the future, Horizen stressed that it is committed to breaking new ground in the modular blockchain industry, particularly in terms of reducing costs and increasing rollup efficiencies. Crucially, Horizen wants to make the network more compatible with the addition of zkStack. By doing this, Horizen hopes to increase its market reach and interoperability.
Additionally, the blockchain platform said it also has plans to open up access to the public. This move will potentially enable the Horizen community to operate the testnet nodes and function as validators.
It is worth mentioning that the launch of Horizen’s proof verification chain testnet is only one of the platform’s latest achievements. In October, Horizen deployed a mainnet of the Ethereum Open Network (EON). Horizen EON is a smart contract sidechain platform that is completely compatible with the EVM. It is intended to play a critical role in the Web3 revolution while also empowering the next generation of developers.
Through the utilization of ZK proof verification and modular architecture, Horizen is advancing the goal of a decentralized future by creating a blockchain ecosystem that is more scalable, accessible, and efficient.
Increasing Attention on ZK Proofs Incorporation
Meanwhile, a host of blockchain platforms are making efforts toward incorporating ZK-proof solutions. For instance, Lynex and Salus recently collaborated to provide the first ZK integration on Linea, increasing privacy and confidentiality for all Lynex users. The privacy advantages are due to ZK-proofs, which ensure that trades on Lynex stay anonymous even after verification, allowing customers to trade with total confidence and anonymity.
Remarkably, Gate.io, a prominent crypto exchange has also announced improvements to its Proof of Reserves (PoR) mechanism, including a new open-source solution based on zero-knowledge technology. The primary goal of introducing zk-SNARKs is to resolve concerns about the prior system, which allowed for the inclusion of fake accounts with negative balances to alter the data.

Global Officials Emphasize Responsible Use of AI to Drive Innovation

In an event at the Swedish Embassy, the United States and Sweden leaders highlighted the future of artificial intelligence (AI) technology that may reshape all areas while reiterating the responsible and ethical use of such power to better the world.International collaboration for ethical AIMr. Paul-Arne Hjelmborn, director general for trade in the Swedish Ministry of Foreign Affairs, expressed the importance of coordinated actions among the allied nations for building a strong framework against AI abuses. He underlined that only promoting a worldwide dialogue on the AI issues at stake could help unlock the positive outcomes and mitigate any possible setbacks. Hjelmborg accentuated the shared democratic values between the USA and Sweden, which should be the key principles for the future development of AI applications.The passage of the last non-binding resolution by the United Nations General Assembly to manage the risks arising from AI distills the first step towards a globally held consensus on AI that meets the principle of safety, reliability, and trustability of the systems we build. Moreover, by citing the EU AI Act, enacted earlier and aims to regulate the risks associated with AI development, Hjelmborn referred to the implemented framework for these risks in the EU. To achieve respect for the US policies, he believed that as long as Americans started catching the inspiration, they could consider the same regulatory edges.Although the US has made progress in dealing with AI-related issues, such as the executive order issued by President Joe Biden in October of 2023 as an effort mainly to promote the proactive and trustworthy development of AI, conducting an all-inclusive legislative policy remains a big challenge. The Senate is working on several possibilities to move things bipartisanly, but lawmakers approach the initial proposals with caution and timidity.Public and private collaboration in AI developmentAt this event, Gregory Singleton, the main AI officer for the Health and Human Services Department (HHS), greatly stressed the importance of putting high standards in place to respond to AI bias, discrimination, and harm. He highlighted the prospect of public and private partnerships for the cultivation of AI for the sake of us humans.He articulated the plausible uses of AI in the health sector, which can use machine learning as a decision-making assistant and prevent health providers from having hectic workloads. He emphasized the role of clinicians in obtaining correct data that positively affected the outcomes.The AI developers work in particular fields, and the worldwide interest focus is shifting increasingly to the responsible approach and ethical considerations. This permits reaping advantages and protection against downsides or unforeseen and unbenign effects. International cooperation, regulatory procedures, and public-private alliances must be the cornerstone for AI adoption in the outlook. Through collaborative actions and endeavors to create ethical AI solutions that implement those original principles and fundamental values, AI can have a positive impact.

Three Crypto AI Projects Announce Merger To Form ‘The Superintelligence Alliance’ With New Token in the Works - The Daily Hodl


								Fetch.ai (FET), Singularitynet (AGIX) and Ocean Protocol (OCEAN) are merging to create the largest independent player in artificial intelligence (AI) research and development.
In a statement, Fetch.ai says it is melding minds with the two other blockchain-based artificial intelligence (AI) platforms to form The Superintelligence Alliance.










“The Superintelligence Alliance is a united stand against the big tech’s control over technology. We’re joining forces to change the game on how AI is created, shared, and used by everyone leaning into the principles of decentralization to accomplish an open and equitable form of AI.”
The objective is to enable the newly formed alliance to compete with leading centralized entities.
“The resources needed to win this competition are immense and the solution needs to be vertically integrated into the whole technology stack, including infrastructure like data management, AI Agents, and models and predictions. The Alliance brings together the skills and expertise of our respective companies in the pursuit of Superintelligence (ASI).
This is our first major step in our audacious mission of creating decentralized Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) and ASI.”
The development will also see the creation of a new universal token to be called Artificial Intelligence (ASI).
“The combined value of the Alliance at signing is $7.5 Billion (theoretically ranking at #20 on Coinmarketcap)p with 2.631 Billion tokens and a starting price of $2.82, with FET as the benchmark currency.”
The respective tokens of the three projects made substantial gains following the announcement. OCEAN is now trading for $1.45, up by 5.90% over the past 24 hours.  FET is priced at $3.32, up by 7.36% and AGIX is changing hands for $1.40, up by 6.82%.

Did Ripple Just Have Settlement Talks with SEC?


Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse was spotted earlier today at the federal courthouse in New York alongside chief lawyer Stuart Alderoty, according to photos shared by the @bobaboy76239 account on the X social media network.  As per the CourtListener legal database, there was a settlement conference scheduled for this Friday. A spokesperson for Ripple told Fox Business reporter Eleanor Terrett that there was "nothing to share."According to Terrett, this could be just a mandatory meeting that was supposed to take place before the pretrial conference that is scheduled to happen on Apr. 16. As per a ruling by U.S. District Judge Analisa Torres, the parties were supposed to meet in person for at least one hour for settlement talks. Hence, the odds of Ripple scoring a settlement with the SEC this Friday appear to be extremely small. As reported by U.Today, the regulator is demanding that Ripple pays more than $2 billion in fees and penalties. The gargantuan sum is supposed to deter others from potential violations of the same scope. Ripple's top executives, including CEO Garlinghouse and co-founder Chris Larsen, have harshly criticized the SEC. Meanwhile, Alderoty has accused the SEC of trying to intimidate Ripple and the broader cryptocurrency industry with such demands. Ripple is supposed to file its reply next month, meaning that the fight is far from over for the company. Meanwhile, Fox Business journalist Charles Gasparino is convinced that the SEC is going to appeal Torres's controversial ruling in the Ripple case, which did not recognize the XRP token as an unregistered security in a win for the San Francisco-based company.

IdeaSoft and INTMAX To Launch JIBx DEX on Plasma Next



IdeaSoft, a member of the Sigma Software Group specializing in fintech blockchain applications, has embarked on a collaborative venture with INTMAX, developer of the open-source Ethereum scalability solution Plasma Next.

The collaboration is targeted at pioneering a Decentralized Exchange (DEX) named JIBx. The goal is to launch a groundbreaking advancement in the Plasma Next network through this collaboration. In an official press release shared with Coinspeaker, the goal is to make the DEX as convenient as any Centralized Exchange (CEX) counterpart.
IdeaSoft and INTMAX to Transform the DEX Landscape
The idea is to transform the DEX ecosystem with JIBx with plans to offer a wide range of innovative features such as zero transaction fees, restaking capabilities, and leverage of up to 250X.




The DEX has an on-chain matching engine with off-chain private settlement and account layers which is meant to guarantee both the security and efficiency of Ethereum. Ethereum gas fees had recently soared following a strong inscription debut on blobs even after the successful implementation of the Ethereum Dencun upgrade. With JIBx, more efficiency can be introduced overall.
A notable feature of the DEX which is poised to be the first of its kind in that it combines the convenience of centralized exchanges with the integrity and security of decentralized platforms. This will also include an efficient funding rate model that grants rewards from collateral re-staking immediately after a user opens their position.
Other core features are stablecoin and LST staking pools, bootstrapped re-staking, and perpetual swaps with high leverage.
Just this week, Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin floated a proposal to enhance the decentralization and fairness of Ethereum’s staking mechanism. His program’s goal is to mitigate the errors made by validators on the effectiveness of the network.
Advancements in Ethereum Scalability Solutions
Commenting on the collaboration, Andrey Lazorenko, Co-founder and CEO of IdeaSoft, expressed confidence at the prospect of integrating INTMAX Plasma Next with his team.
According to him, “It’s exactly what we need to make many of the projects faster, more convenient for users, and finally get overwhelming adoption. Can’t wait to see what we’ll build with this.”
Similarly, INTMAX Co-founder Leona Hioki maintains confidence in the IdeaSoft team which he described as highly talented and professional, with unmatched experience in financial trading in general and virtual currency in particular. Hioki agreed with the importance of Distributed Validator Technology (DVT) in Ethereum when Buterin rolled out his roadmap early last month.
Plasma Next signifies the outcome of years of development in Ethereum scalability solutions meant to address essential issues such as fund exit challenges and on-chain verification costs. The Plasma Next system eliminates the need for constant online vigilance and provides a practical solution to achieving statelessness in blockchain systems via zero-knowledge proofs.

Saudi Arabia Plans $40 Billion AI Investment Fund, Eyes Partnership with Silicon Valley's Andreessen Horowitz



                    
The Saudi Arabian government is actively considering the establishment of a massive $40 billion investment fund dedicated to advancements in artificial intelligence (AI). 



This strategic move, expected to unfold in the latter half of the year, aims to position Saudi Arabia as a leading player in the AI domain.




This initiative is being spearheaded by the Public Investment Fund of Saudi Arabia, which is reportedly in talks with the Silicon Valley-based venture capital giant Andreessen Horowitz (a16z) to manage the AI investments, according to a March 19 report by The New York Times, which cited three individuals familiar with the discussions. 



The collaboration might not only bring additional venture capital firms into the fold but could also lead to a16z establishing a presence in Riyadh, the capital of Saudi Arabia.



Ben Horowitz, a co-founder of a16z, shares a personal connection with Yasir Al-Rumayyan, the governor of the Saudi fund, highlighting the close ties between the venture capital firm and the Saudi initiative. 




With the proposed $40 billion investment, Saudi Arabia is set to eclipse other major players in the AI investment space, including Microsoft, which has invested $13 billion into OpenAI, the creator of ChatGPT.

The funding for Saudi Arabia’s ambitious AI project will be sourced from its $900 billion sovereign wealth fund, with investments targeting chip manufacturers and large data centers capable of supporting AI technologies. 



The Kingdom is also exploring the possibility of launching its own AI companies.



These discussions between Saudi Arabia and a16z have been ongoing since at least April 2023. 



Horowitz has lauded Saudi Arabia as a burgeoning “startup country,” contrasting it with what he perceives as a slowdown in the United States’ startup ecosystem.



The backdrop to these developments includes recent actions by U.S. President Joe Biden, who, in October last year, issued an executive order establishing new AI safety standards. 



This initiative has garnered support from 15 leading AI firms and involves measures such as the invocation of the Defense Production Act to ensure AI companies report crucial information, including safety test results, to the Department of Commerce. 



This comes in a context where OpenAI’s CEO, Sam Altman, sought a staggering $7 trillion investment from the United Arab Emirates, a neighbor to Saudi Arabia, for the development of more advanced semiconductor chips.

Crypto Analyst Says Altcoin Markets Are Ready To Pop, Lays Out a Path for Bitcoin - The Daily Hodl


								A widely followed crypto trader is analyzing the altcoin and crypto markets while plotting out Bitcoin’s (BTC) next move.
Crypto analyst Michaël van de Poppe tells his 708,700 followers on the social media platform X that the altcoin markets, which include all tokens except for BTC and Ethereum (ETH), are prepping to reach for a new all-time high (ATH).










“The total Altcoin market capitalization is eager for a continuation.
This means that I’m expecting a correction to be happening, or at least consolidation, before a big surge towards the ATH.”

Looking at some specific altcoins, the analyst thinks Litecoin (LTC), Cosmos (ATOM) and Polkadot (DOT) are on their way up.
“Litecoin moving up, and dino coins are following.
Expecting the Ethereum ecosystem to do well, including ATOM and DOT.”
Shifting to the overall crypto market cap, which includes altcoins as well as BTC and ETH, Van de Poppe says the markets may stall momentarily before rallying once more.
“Massive run on the markets for the Crypto market capitalization.
Overall, I suspect we will consolidate before we continue to rally. 
This year has been a blast so far, and this probably continues to do so, but for now, consolidation.”
Source: Michaël van de Poppe/X
Finally, focusing on king crypto BTC, the trader tells his followers not to expect Bitcoin to jump to $100,000 too soon.
“The range is relatively defined on Bitcoin.
I don’t believe we’ll blast to $100,000 all of a sudden and are still following the path of the 4-year cycle, for now. 
Consolidating areas at $60,000 support ranges, areas around ATH to be resistance. 
In between chop.”

BTC is worth $69,440 at time of writing, down 3% in the last 24 hours.

Bitcoin Will Rocket To $150,000 By 2025, Veteran Hedge Fund Manager Predicts ⋆ ZyCrypto

&nbsp

&nbsp
Bitcoin’s (BTC) price has increased astronomically in recent months to hit as high as $73,737 on March 14, 2024. Despite this phenomenal growth, is there room for BTC to hit six figures from its current trading price? 



Mark Yusko, the founder and CEO of Morgan Creek Capital Management, thinks it is possible. Yusko recently postulated that Bitcoin’s next market cycle could see the premier crypto trade for $150,000 by 2025 as the upcoming halving event could add to the ETF tailwinds for the asset.



Bitcoin Will Top $150K In 2025



While appearing on CNBC on March 28, Mark Yusko shared a bold price forecast: Bitcoin (BTC) hitting an eye-popping $150,000 in the coming months. Yusko uses Metcalfe’s law model to estimate BTC’s present “fair value” at $50,000.



The next halving, which is now three weeks away, has historically been a major catalyst for crypto rallies. The pre-programmed halving mechanism reduces BTC’s block rewards by 50% every four years.



When the block rewards get slashed to 3.125 from 6.25, then the price has to soar for the miners to continue to make money, the Morgan Creek executive noted. As the price rises, so does the fair value. Yusko added that this cycle will likely be different owing to transaction fees generated by Ordinals and Inscriptions. As such, he envisions a fair value of $75,000 post-halving as there will be increased investor interest and FOMO hitting full swing.

“So in the last cycle fair value was $30,000, we got to as high as $69,000. This time, I think probably two times because there’s less leverage. So that gets us to $150,000,” Yusko explained.



If history repeats itself, an even more bullish period for Bitcoin could be on the horizon in the months following the halving. In Yusko’s opinion, Bitcoin could hit the $150K projected peak roughly nine months after the April halving:



“Well, think about it… if there’s more demand than supply, the price has to rise. So the price starts to rise. It starts to become more exponential or parabolic toward the end of the year, and historically, about nine months after the halving. So sometime toward Thanksgiving, Christmas we see the peak in price before the next bear market.”



Meanwhile, other big names have also made similar bullish Bitcoin price predictions. Rich Dad Poor Dad author sees BTC hitting $100,000 after the halving, while British multinational bank Standard Chartered expects the OG crypto to reach $150,000 this year.

Polymarket sees bets of $2.4 million on Ethereum ETF approval

Crypto traders have entered the speculative market, making bets on the potential approval of a spot Ethereum exchange-traded fund (ETF) by the United States Securities and Exchange Commission. The United States SEC is set to make its verdict before May 31, and market participants have lined up to make bets on it on Ploymarket.Polymarket registers bets on the approval of a spot Ethereum ETFPolymarket is a crypto-based gambling platform where participants in the crypto market make bets on the likelihood of events happening. The current dynamics on Polymarket have shown that traders are actively speculating on the outcome of the SEC concerning the Ethereum ETF approval. Presently, over $2.4 million worth of bets have been placed on the platform, with about 81% of the traders unsure of the likelihood of an approval occurring before the end of May.Crypto traders purchase shares that reflect their choice of bets on Polymarket. The value of the shares on the platform is volatile, fluctuating to mirror real-life sentiments in the market. Presently, the share representing Yes for approval goes for $0.19, while a share representing No goes for $0.81. The current pricing is an indication that there is little belief that the approval will happen before the set date, and traders are betting on it.Notably, both categories of shares have seen a significant amount of investment made in them. Presently, the highest investment in the Yes category is worth $84,000 while the highest investment in the No category stands at $127,000. The investment made in these shares shows how serious traders on Polymarket are willing to back their predictions.Market sentiment and Grayscale’s optimismThe outcome of the bets placed on Polymarket lies solely on the action of the United States SEC toward the approval of an Ethereum ETF. This means that the SEC needs to approve an Ethereum ETF by May 31, 2024, at 11:59 ET for Yes share bettors to win their bets. While the traders who hold the No shares will win if the SEC doesn’t approve the ETF by the deadline.This is not the first time such actions tied to the crypto industry will be taking place on the platform. Before the SEC approved spot Bitcoin ETF, bettors on the platform made bets on it. However, there has been criticism from all angles on bettors on the platform, with most people questioning why they would choose to engage in an activity that yields such little profits.Despite the skepticism, the betting market for ETF outcomes has seen substantial activity, with at least $12 million in total bets. Interestingly, investment management firm Grayscale has expressed optimism regarding the approval of spot Ether ETFs. Craig Salm, Grayscale’s Chief Legal Officer, emphasized that the SEC’s apparent lack of engagement with applicants should not be construed as a definitive indicator of approval or rejection.This confidence from a prominent player in the crypto investment space adds another dimension to the ongoing speculation surrounding ETF approvals. The gambling market surrounding the approval of a spot Ethereum ETF by the SEC reflects the diverse sentiments and expectations within the crypto community. As the May 31 deadline approaches, traders continue to monitor developments closely, with their bets serving as a barometer of market sentiment and confidence in regulatory outcomes.

CFTC commissioner warns against infringing on SEC’s authority in KuCoin case

Caroline Pham, a commissioner with the United States Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC), has suggested that a recent “aggressive” crypto enforcement action could put the regulator at odds with the Securities and Exchange Commission.In a March 29 statement, Pham said the CFTC appeared to have exerted authority over certain securities in its enforcement case against cryptocurrency exchange KuCoin. The commission charged the firm “with multiple violations of the Commodity Exchange Act (CEA) and CFTC regulations” on March 26, parallel to criminal charges from the U.S. Justice Department.“The CFTC’s approach may infringe upon the SEC’s authority and undermine decades of robust investor protection laws by conflating a financial instrument with a financial activity, disrupting the foundations of securities markets,” said Pham. “Owning shares is not the same thing as trading derivatives.”Related: KuCoin says user assets are unaffected by US SDNY indictmentPham’s statement echoed concerns from many U.S. lawmakers and regulators about the role the CFTC and SEC should play over cryptocurrencies and how they are judged as commodities or securities. Officials representing both regulators have been at odds over Ether (ETH) recently as crypto firm Prometheum announced it planned to offer custody services as a security. The KuCoin complaint from the CFTC suggested that Ether was a commodity. However, legal experts said the SEC potentially labeling ETH as a security could impact the commission’s decision on several spot Ether exchange-traded fund applications in the pipeline.Magazine: KuCoin’s desperate $10M airdrop, 1 tweet raises $37M for memecoin: Asia Express

Vitalik Buterin Calls Out Copy-And-Paste Meme Coins: 'I Want To See Higher Quality Fun Projects' Ethereum Co-Founder Vitalik Buterin Calls Out Copy-And-Paste Meme Coins: 'I Want To See Higher Quality Fun Projects' - Benzinga

A co-founder of cryptocurrency Ethereum ETH/USD is sharing his thoughts on a crypto cycle that has favored meme coins.Here's what Vitalik Buterin had to say in a recent post.What Happened: Fresh off his commentary on the metaverse being "poorly defined," Buterin shared his thoughts on meme coins and the good and bad that could be realized.Back in 2014, Buterin shared thoughts on how issuing new coins could help fund public projects."The thinking went: society needs ways to fund valuable large-scale projects, markets and institutions are the main techniques that we have today, and both work in some cases and fail in others," Buterin said.Buterin said issuing new coins could be a third class of funding technology."People who care about cancer research could hold, accept and trade AntiCancerCoin; people who care about saving the environment would hold and use ClimateCoin, and so forth. The coins that people choose to use would determine what causes got funded."Buterin said that meme coins are now a huge topic in 2024, continuing on the same path as meme coins like Dogecoin DOGE/USD in 2020 and 2021."This time, they are heating up again, but in a way that is making many people feel uneasy, because there isn't anything particularly new and interesting about the meme coins."The Ethereum co-founder said that several Solana SOL/USD meme coins are "openly super racist.” Buterin said that people should stand "against this stupidity."Meme Coins For Good: Among the positives in the meme coin space are charity coins where a portion of the token supply or an ongoing fee goes to a charity, the Ethereum co-founder said. Buterin names GiveWell Inu and Fable of the Dragon Tyrant as coins that have supported charity. Both coins have their flaws he said, and they include a lack of maintenance for GiveWell Inu and Dragon Tyrant having "annoying" community members."It feels like there is an unclaimed opportunity here to try to create something more positive-sum and long-lasting. But ultimately, I think even that would create something fundamentally limited, and we can do better," Buterin said.Buterin highlighted what he calls "Robin Hood games" in his post.The Ethereum co-founder said he recognized play-to-earn mechanics in Axie Infinity and how people in low-income Southeast Asian countries have been able to benefit from the game."I get the impression that if you take the game's play-to-earn properties into account, on average, the net financial gains were negative for high-income users but might (emphasis on might!) have been positive for low-income users."Buterin said this is the way it should be, adding that it’s best to put the safety net on lower-income users and be "brutal on those who can handle it.""We should be making not simple copy-paste coins but rather more complicated and interesting games and games that leave lower-income players in particular economically better off."Related Link: 5 Things That May Surprise You About Ethereum Creator Vitalik ButerinWhy It's Important: Buterin says people buy meme coins because the value might go up, they are open to participation and they are fun."We can siphon off a large percent of a meme coin's supply to support public goods that people value," Buterin said.Buterin said he has no enthusiasm for coins that are scams, rugpulls or named after totalitarian political movements."I want to see higher quality fun projects that contribute positively to the ecosystem and the world around them get more mindshare."Ideally, Buterin said there would be more good meme coins than bad meme coins and a common goal of supporting public goods.Read Next: As Dogecoin, Shiba Inu Surge, Ethereum Co-Founder Vitalik Buterin Warns ‘Some Categories..Are Way Over-Invested’Vitalik Buterin.

American crypto lobbyists might just be our biggest problem | Cryptopolitan

America, land of the free, home of the brave, and now, a playground for crypto lobbyists who seem to have taken the term “influencing policy” to an entirely new level, kickstarting a sort of political war that could very well dictate the future of finance in the United States. Think I’m being dramatic? Okay.Read on!You’d think with high-profile cases like Sam Bankman-Fried’s, serving a 25-year vacation in prison for his crypto shenanigans, and Changpeng “CZ” Zhao, awaiting his fate for skirting around some important legal policies, America would be on the verge of taming the beast that is cryptocurrency industry. Not to mention, the spectacular implosion of digital tokens like Luna has left many a crypto magnate looking less like the future of finance and more like cautionary tales.Do NOT jump in.That’s what *they* say.The Undying Spirit of Crypto EnthusiastsBut man, despite all the setbacks, the crypto industry is doing better than ever. Bitcoin, the poster child of cryptocurrencies, recently hit a record-breaking $73,000. This is because the folks mining Bitcoin decided to slow their roll, and also of course, because the gates have been flung wide open for bitcoin exchange traded funds, thanks to the nod from our friendly neighborhood SEC.Now, what’s truly mind-blowing to me is how the crypto sector, in the face of all these regulatory slapdowns, has decided to double down on its efforts to sway future regulatory frameworks. And I’m not just talking about a few million dollars thrown at political campaigns.Oh no. There is a full-blown, wallet-breaking campaign that has seen crypto lobbying funds jump from a mere $1.5 million in 2020 to a jaw-dropping $27 million in 2022. And with the FTX drama not deterring these efforts, 2023 saw an even bigger splash of cash, mainly from Coinbase, alongside the Blockchain Association and Binance.It gets even better — or worse, depending on how you look at it.A so-called crypto dark money group called ‘Fairshake’ managed to get around $80 million in just the last quarter of 2023. Their mission was to take down any political figure daring to question the sanctity of cryptocurrency, with Senator Elizabeth Warren and Sherrod Brown being prime targets. As one would expect.A Tangled Web of Money and PoliticsThe audacity of crypto lobbying efforts is mostly in their willingness to dive headfirst into American politics, challenging the very ethos of what many believed cryptocurrencies stood for — a financial system untainted by the grip of traditional power structures.Yet, here we are, witnessing the crypto industry not just engaging with but actively shaping the political scene in America. The story spun by Fairshake and other crypto proponents about fostering innovation and needing a clearer regulatory framework might sound noble. However, when you peel back the layers, it’s clear that the end goal is to carve out an industry where they can thrive with minimal oversight.Comparisons with traditional banking and other sectors’ lobbying efforts are inevitable.Yes, the crypto lobbying machine might still be in its infancy compared to the Goliaths of the financial world, but what sets it apart is its focused aggression and the bipartisan nature of its influence. So both Republicans and Democrats find themselves in the crosshairs of crypto lobbyists.The irony of it all? Crypto, once hailed as the digital David against the Goliath of the financial establishment, has now cozied up to the very “swamp” it aimed to drain. The Blockchain Association’s reluctant admission of their lobbying efforts as a necessary evil to protect their interests showcases the ironic position our industry finds itself in.Sooooo, yeah that’s about it.

Unexplained transfers on LENX protocol spark rug pull concerns

Rumors of a slow rug pull involving liquidity protocol LENX are flooding social media channels as the community speculates about unexplained transfers of tokens worth millions of dollars. According to reports from pseudonymous X user AstroBoy and Etherscan data, LENX Finance’s founders, John Kim and a person simply known as Paul, had transferred over $10 million worth of treasury assets to a Binance account without clear justification, draining LENX wallets. Source: AstroBoyOn the protocol’s Discord server, users have complained about the lack of communication since the transactions were first spotted on March 26, along with consistent transfers to Binance and messages about the suspicious withdrawals being removed.The protocol was launched in January 2024, promising to support native Bitcoin for yield generation or to borrow against. According to CoinGecko, LENX’s native token, LENX XD (XD), was valued at $0.26 in early January, versus $0.02 at the time of writing. LENX is backed by the lending protocol FRAX Finance. Cointelegraph reached out to both co-founders of LENX Finance but did not receive an immediate response. The FRAX Finance team was not available for comment. Community member 0xg4m813 points to issues surrounding the protocol amid debate over funds transfers. Source: LENX's DiscordMedia company Flywheel DeFi reportedly spoke with Kim over a chat, but the co-founder declined to comment. “Sorry, I don’t have much to say at the moment,” Kim wrote. Paul’s last Discord activity was on March 26, when he announced he was investigating the withdrawals. “I’m trying to investigate right now.”According to reports on Discord, the LENX team was able to freeze the Binance account that received the funds, with $3 million in remaining funds safeguarded. An ongoing investigation is reportedly in progress over Kim’s activities, while Paul is cooperating with legal efforts. A rug pull is a type of scam where developers suddenly withdraw all funds from a project or liquidity pool, leaving investors with worthless tokens or assets.In 2023, the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) reported that crypto-related investment fraud saw a significant increase in the United States, with losses rising from $2.57 billion in 2022 to approximately $3.94 billion, marking a 53% increase.

New Development on the Arbitrum (ARB) Front: Developers Announced - Bitcoin Sistemi


Arbitrum (ARB) Foundation announced the launch of the third phase of its funding plan. The application process for this phase will be open from April 15 until the end of June.
This phase will primarily focus on decentralized application (dApp) projects, including games, Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs), social platforms, Decentralized Autonomous Organizations (DAOs) and Decentralized Finance (DeFi). Projects will be categorized according to their stages, growth forecasts and types, and allocated to specific financing channels.


The application form for Phase 2 will officially close on April 3, 2024. Following this, new applications for Phase 3 will open on April 15, 2024.
The grants in question will be distributed to developers in ARB.





Previously, Arbitrum held a public competition in October as part of a $44 million short-term incentive program.
Projects funded by Arbitrum's incentive program have mostly grown in terms of total value locked (TVL), volume, fees, and daily active users (DAUs) after receiving funding. However, the cryptocurrency market as a whole has increased over this time period, so it is probably too early to draw conclusions about the funds' effectiveness.

UK and U.S. unite to expose Russia's $20 billion illegal crypto trade | Cryptopolitan

The United States and the United Kingdom have rolled up their sleeves and are investigating what looks like a gross $20 billion mishandling of crypto. Yeah, you heard that right. $20 billion with a ‘B’.They’re zeroing in on Garantex, that Russian exchange that’s been under so many sanctions, amidst a storm of crypto transactions that could very well be fueling Russia’s unsavory adventures in Ukraine.The stakes? BIG.The implications? Even bigger.I’m talking about the huge amount of USDT—Tether, the darling of the crypto market that [tries to] sticks to the dollar like glue—sashaying through Garantex.So you know this Moscow-based exchange has been the go-to spot for all kinds of illegal crypto transactions, despite having a big, red ‘sanctioned’ stamp on its forehead by both the U.S. and UK.A Cat-and-Mouse GameNow Garantex has had its share of the limelight since its birth in 2019 Estonia. Fast forward to today, and it’s practically got its roots buried deep in Moscow’s Federation Tower. Estonia showed Garantex the door back in February 2022, right around when Uncle Sam and the Brits were sharpening their sanctions pencils.The U.S. Treasury isn’t playing around either.They’ve got Garantex in their sights, for being the perfect playground for bad guys, including a certain Russia-based ransomware posse known as Conti. These guys were supposedly having a field day with over $100 million in illicit activities, all under Garantex’s watch. And to make things worse, Garantex was caught on camera, cozying up with sanctioned Russian banks and mapping out ways to keep the US dollar within arm’s reach, despite the sanctions.Oops.Oh Crypto, the Double-Edged Sword You AreTether, the diva right in the middle of this whole problem, sits on a throne made of over $100 billion worth of coins. She’s like the James Bond of cryptocurrencies—smooth, reliable, and always on a mission.Tether Holdings claims they’ve got everything under control. Every transaction is under the microscope, and they’re in cahoots with law enforcement to keep the monsters at bay.“With Tether, every criminal can be caught,” they say. Bold words, no? Because as we all know, criminals have a soft spot for Tether. It’s their go-to currency for everything shady, from online scams that would make your grandma’s head spin to dodgy deals that cross international borders. And despite Tether Holdings’ best efforts to freeze assets tied to the naughty list, the $19.3 billion in illicit transactions tells a different story.So I’m not really sure about that, Tether.As for the U.S. and UK, they seem to have once again found a common enemy to play friends against. Can’t wait to see what happens next.

U.S. Bank and Oppenheimer Paying $7,000,000 Fine, Admit To Using Unofficial Communications Channels in Federal Crackdown - The Daily Hodl


								U.S. Bank and Oppenheimer & Co will pay a total of $7 million to the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) in a federal crackdown on off-channel communications and improper record keeping.
The CFTC has jointly ordered both U.S. Bank and Oppenheimer & Co, an introducing broker, to pay $6 million and $1 million in civil monetary penalties respectively for the same offense.










The CFTC says the firms have admitted that from at least 2019 until now, both of the firms failed to prevent their employees from using unapproved communication channels such as personal text messages.
“The firms were required to keep certain of these written communications because they related to the firm’s CFTC-registered businesses. 
These written communications generally were not maintained and preserved by either firm, and neither firm generally would have been able to provide them promptly to the CFTC if and when requested.
Each order further finds the firm-wide use of unapproved communication methods violated each firm’s internal policies and procedures, which generally prohibited business-related communication via unapproved methods. Further, some of the supervisory personnel responsible for ensuring compliance with the firm’s policies and procedures also used unapproved communication methods to engage in business-related communications, in violation of firm policy.”
U.S. Bank reportedly has about $650 billion in assets under management while Oppenheimer has $28 billion.
The CFTC says that since December 2021, the agency has imposed a total of $1.124 billion in civil monetary penalties on 22 different financial institutions for the same violation – the unapproved communication methods, in violation of CFTC recordkeeping and supervision requirements.
Last year, the US-registered broker-dealer arm of BNP Paribas said it was being investigated by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and the CFTC for possibly breaking record-keeping provisions and for using private text messages for communcation.

Vitalik Buterin Praises Worldcoin, Despite Privacy Concerns - DailyCoin


        
Vitalik Buterin praises Worldcoin’s privacy and data handling methods.



Worldcoin’s efforts aim to establish a global, unique digital identity system.



Multiple governments have banned Worldcoin due to privacy concerns. 
Worldcoin has been in the spotlight for its novel approach to creating a universal digital identity through iris scanning. However, this method has not been without its critics, who raise concerns over the potential for privacy infringement.Despite the criticism, Vitalik Buterin, the co-founder of Ethereum, recently voiced his support for Worldcoin’s efforts to address these privacy concerns. Privacy is a top issue for the project, as it relies on biometric data, scanning users’ irises to create a unique digital identity for each user. Buterin Commends Worldcoin for Taking Privacy SeriouslyOn Friday, March 29, Vitalik Buterin, known for his pioneering work with Ethereum, recognized Worldcoin’s efforts to balance creating a universal digital identity with the need for stringent privacy measures. In a Tweet reply to tech writer Louis Anslow, Buternin commended Worldcoin for “taking privacy concerns seriously.” He also highlighted the project’s advances in cryptography, making its approach “data minimal.”
There are many privacy concerns, and they primarily revolve around the potential misuse of biometric data. Specifically, Worldcoin’s system stores hashed versions of iris scans and claims this system protects user’s privacy. Despite this, there are still worries about potential identity theft. 
The potential for hacking, coercion, and system misuse, such as selling or renting IDs, presents significant security risks. Buterin also stresses the importance of a reliable mechanism for identity recovery to prevent financial loss and misuse.Worldcoin Banned, Investigated in Multiple CountriesButerin’s latest remarks came when multiple governments have investigated or outright banned Worldcoin. For instance, Kenya has been a significant market for Worldcoin, before suspending orb scanning over privacy concerns. The suspension remains until authorities are convinced there’s no risk to the public. In France, investigations into Worldcoin focus on its biometric data collection practices, questioning their compliance with data protection regulations. Additionally, the UK’s Information Commissioner’s Office announced it would be investigating the company. Argentina has also opened an investigation into Worldcoin, examining its handling of personal data amid growing concerns over the project’s adherence to privacy laws​​. Moreover, Spain temporarily banned Worldcoin operations over similar issues for up to three months. On the Flipside
Worldcoin aims to create a universal digital identity to simplify and secure online verification processes. The goal is to make it easier for individuals to access services and for companies to authenticate users. 



A security audit published on March 15 found that Worldcoin has no security vulnerabilities. The audit came after a major hack to the network. 
Why This MattersThe discussion surrounding Worldcoin and its potential use cases sheds light on the broader implications for digital identity. However, the project has to navigate major challenges, especially regarding privacy protection. Read more about Worldcoin’s ban in Spain: Spain Blocks Worldcoin as a “Precautionary Measure”Read more about Ethereum’s latest milestone: Ethereum Reaches 1M Validators: Will it Boost the Network?

CFTC Commissioner Slams Agency After KuCoin Charges

                        CFTC Commissioner Caroline D. Pham issued a statement Friday seemingly criticizing her own agency for its latest “aggressive enforcement action” following the agency’s KuCoin charges, saying it might “infringe upon the SEC’s authority.”While Pham commended the independent government agency’s “vigilance” in “protecting” U.S. markets through the KuCoin charges, she expressed concern that the move may overstep the CFTC’s role in crypto regulation.CFTC Commissioner Slams Agency’s KuCoin Charges
“The CFTC’s approach may infringe upon the SEC’s authority and undermine decades of robust investor protection laws by conflating a financial instrument with a financial activity, disrupting the foundations of securities markets,” Pham said in the statement. “Owning shares is not the same thing as trading derivatives.”CFTC charged the cryptocurrency exchange KuCoin on Tuesday, alleging that the digital asset firm engaged in a wide range of illegal activities, including dealing in off-exchange commodity futures, offering unregistered leveraged or margined transactions, and improperly soliciting orders.Equally important, the federal agency claims that the crypto exchange did not adequately implement know-your-customer (KYC) procedures, calling them a “sham” that “did not prevent U.S. customers from trading commodity interests and derivatives on the platform.”The Battle Between The CFTC And SEC Continues
The CFTC and the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) have long fought over who would lead the country’s regulatory approach in the cryptocurrency sector.The CFTC typically regulates commodities, while the SEC traditionally controls securities.In a similar yet separate criminal matter on Tuesday, the Department of Justice (DOJ) hit KuCoin with its own set of charges, including “violating the Bank Secrecy Act” and “operating an unlicensed money transmitter business.”Meanwhile, KuCoin CEO Johnny Lyu pushed back against the charges in a statement posted to X, claiming they were standard for the digital asset industry. While the SEC has approved Bitcoin for spot ETF trading, recent reports indicate that the federal agency is looking to label Ethereum as a security, diminishing hopes for a spot ETH ETF.Conversely, the CFTC’s enforcement action labels Bitcoin and Ethereum as commodities.Strife Amongst Crytpo Regulatory Bodies?
Meanwhile, SEC Chair Gary Gensler has long been under scrutiny for his stringent regulation-by-enforcement approach, failing to provide a clear regulatory framework for the digital asset industry.The SEC has an infamous history of cracking down on perceived crypto-related securities violations and instigating legal battles with key players in the digital asset industry, including Binance, Coinbase, and Ripple Labs.The CFTC Commissioner’s statement of disagreement may reveal deeper frustrations of federal agency employees in the difficult quest of regulating the crypto sector.

BlackRock's Larry Fink is bullish on Bitcoin as spot Bitcoin ETFs fly

The approval of 11 spot Bitcoin ETFs earlier this year by the Securities and Exchange Commission has caused a storm in the ETF industry. And now, according to Farside, the total net inflows to spot Bitcoin ETFs have surpassed $12 billion. On an average basis, there have been $258 million worth of inflows to BlackRock’s IBIT, followed by $140 million to Fidelity’s FBTC and $29.9 million to Bitwise’s BITB.Is Bitcoin a good speculative investment?This new type of security has grown four-fold thanks to mainstream financial institutions’ support. BlackRock CEO Larry Fink, who recently discussed rethinking the U.S. retirement age, is optimistic about Bitcoin ETFs’ future. In an interview with Fox Business, he discussed BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust, or IBIT. “IBIT is the fastest growing ETF in the history of ETFs,” he said. “Nothing has gained assets as fast as IBIT in the history of ETFs.”Fink seems optimistic about Ether ETFs, too. He recently said an ETH ETF is possible even if the SEC treats Ether like a security. Last week, the financial watchdog sent subpoenas to three companies as part of its probe of the Ethereum Foundation, the ecosystem that works behind the Ethereum blockchain network. The 11th spot Bitcoin ETF is ready to tradeEarlier this week, Hashdex Bitcoin ETF, one of 11 spot Bitcoin ETFs approved by the SEC, was launched. Crypto asset management’s Hashdex Bitcoin Futures ETF is trading on the NYSE Arca exchange. Hashdex Bitcoin Futures ETF currently holds 5,500 Bitcoin worth $377.2 million. In comparison, BlackRock’s IBIT holds 244560 Bitcoin, worth $17.1 billion. The crypto market is boomingThe emergence of spot Bitcoin ETFs in the country has been a boon for the crypto market, which had experienced a major crisis over the previous few years. But now Bitcoin has hit record highs. And the upcoming Bitcoin halving event, which will occur in mid-April, is expected to boost the crypto market even further. This event will reduce the reward for mining new Bitcoin by half. Previous halving events have sent Bitcoin prices higher. Bitcoin’s most recent halving took place on May 11, 2020, resulting in a block reward of 6.25 Bitcoin. This year’s halving will reduce the reward to 3.125 Bitcoin for miners.According to CoinMarketCap, in the past week, Bitcoin has risen 9% to $69,000, Ether has jumped 4.7% to $3,500, and Dogecoin has soared 40% to $0.21.

Bitcoin Futures Approved For Trading On Brazil's B3 Exchange, Launching April 17 | Bitcoinist.com


								In response to the global demand for Bitcoin-related products, Brazil has seized the opportunity to capitalize on the momentum surrounding the leading cryptocurrency. 
According to a Reuters report, Brazilian exchange operator B3 announced on Thursday that it has received approval from Brazil’s securities regulator to offer Bitcoin futures trading, which is expected to begin on April 17.
BTC Futures Linked To Nasdaq Reference Price
B3 announced that the official launch date of futures trading for BTC may be subject to change. Nevertheless, the exchange confirmed that future contracts will be linked to the Nasdaq Bitcoin reference price, with each contract representing 10% of the BTC price in Brazilian reais.

Felipe Goncalves, B3’s superintendent of swap rates and currency products, emphasized the significance of this milestone, stating: 
The launch meets the demand for a derivative that allows a hedge against Bitcoin’s price fluctuations or a directional exposure to the asset. 
It is important to note that the Bitcoin futures contract offered by B3 will be settled financially, meaning that no actual buying or selling of BTC will occur. 
This approach aligns with the landscape of regulated derivatives markets, allowing investors to engage with Bitcoin’s price movements without requiring direct ownership of the cryptocurrency.
Brazil Welcomes BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust ETF
This development coincides with one of the world’s largest asset managers, BlackRock, and a prominent Bitcoin Exchange-Traded Fund (ETF) issuer announcing the iShares Bitcoin Trust ETF (IBIT39) launch in Brazil in early March. 
Felipe Gonçalves highlighted the growth of the crypto market in Brazil, citing the existence of 13 ETFs with a total asset value of R$2.5 billion (approximately $505 million). Notably, the market has attracted institutional investors, including funds and individual investors, with a current count of 170,000. 
The iShares Bitcoin Trust ETF (IBIT39) is expected to have a management fee of 0.25%, with a one-year waiver that reduces the fee to 0.12% once the fund surpasses $5 billion in assets under management. 

With B3’s regulatory approval for Bitcoin futures trading and the iShares Bitcoin Trust ETF launch, Brazil is solidifying its position as a significant player in the expanding global Bitcoin and cryptocurrency market. 
These developments provide investors with new avenues to participate in the digital asset ecosystem while fostering the growth and maturation of Brazil’s crypto investment landscape.

The largest cryptocurrency in the market trades at $70,400, demonstrating a rebound from the $60,800 level following a significant correction. BTC has successfully consolidated above this crucial level over the past 24 hours, indicating a strong momentum to surpass its previous all-time high of $73,700, achieved on March 14.
Examining the cryptocurrency’s performance over longer time frames, we see that BTC has exhibited substantial gains. In the past week alone, an impressive increase of 11% was recorded. BTC has experienced a notable surge of 16% in the past month. 
Furthermore, its year-to-date growth is nearly 150%, highlighting the sustained bullish trend that has prevailed since the end of the bear market and the subsequent recovery from the 2022 crypto winter.

Telegram’s Mini Apps tipped to encourage blockchain adoption 1

Director of Investments at TON Foundation Justin Hyun has referred to the emergence of Mini Apps on Telegram as a catalyst that will trigger mass adoption of blockchain technology. Mini Apps are blockchain-based DeFi applications on Telegram, which were launched in 2020. The applications were launched in a bid to simplify interactions on the blockchain without the need for any background education.Telegram set to simplify blockchain adoption with Mini AppsThis perspective shared by Hyun about Mini Apps is in line with the concept of introducing users to the blockchain without using the DApps label. According to Hyun, they can be seen as a ‘Trojan Horse’, where users are allowed to mingle across several apps on Telegram. This way, the users are oblivious to the underlying blockchain technology while enjoying the user-friendly applications on the platform. He mentioned that this approach is very integral to expanding the user base on the blockchain.Telegram ranks in third place among messaging applications, boasting an active user base of over 800 million. Aside from providing the user base for integrating blockchain functionality, its collaboration with the TON Foundation shows the potential of Mini Apps to boost blockchain adoption.A very important aspect of the platform is offering several rewards to its users. This feature will encourage user participation and promote engagement in blockchain-based events without deep-rooted technical knowledge. Telegram also acts as a financial payments feature within its TON blockchain, solidifying its push for innovative financial solutions.Financial incentives and monetization opportunitiesTelegram’s recent launch of its advertising platform on the TON blockchain marks a significant push in its intention to monetize the platform and encourage content creators with rewards. Owners of channels on Telegram can now earn rewards through their advertisements, a revenue model that provides earning opportunities for both Telegram and the content creators.Also, TON Foundation recently announced a $115 million incentive program for its community, a move to solidify its growth strategy. The funds would be used for token mining, liquidity pool boosts, airdrops, and some other incentives on the platform. The initiatives will push for a strong ecosystem around the Mini Apps while helping to push the adoption of its blockchain among different users across the world.The vision of bringing the next 500 million users onto the blockchain by 2028 reflects a long-term commitment to mainstream adoption. Hyun emphasizes the importance of starting with simple use cases that seamlessly integrate blockchain technology, paving the way for more sophisticated applications in the future. This gradual approach ensures a smooth transition for users and promotes sustained growth in blockchain adoption.Telegram’s Mini Apps presents a great opportunity to provide democratic access to blockchain technology. It also provides a way to accelerate its integration into the lives of users. Through its user-friendly interfaces, Mini Apps will play an integral role in shaping the future of dApps. Aside from that, it will also provide web3 incentives that would trigger an increase in blockchain adoption on a huge scale.

Massive USDC inflow to Coinbase boosts confidence in Bitcoin and Ethereum

Coinbase, an outstanding cryptocurrency exchange, received $1.4 billion, the USDC stablecoin backed by the USA dollars and Circle issued. This deal has kept the process of cryptocurrency currency brainstorming, as for the majority, it is considered a clear indication of investors’ readiness to invest their money in this domain of digital finance. Analysts now speculate that such a big inflow will have a ‘significant effect’ on the crypto market, especially Bitcoin and Ethereum, among the other digital coins.USDC influx to CoinbaseThe fact that a large volume of USDC is pumped into Coinbase, in the view of market observers, is interpreted as a positive sign for the market. Stablecoins such as USDC and USDT play a key part in the ramping between fiats like dollars and digital currencies; they act as a bridge and allow for access to liquidity and the ability to exchange in real-time. The return of fiat money in the form of stablecoins to the exchanges tends to move in parallel with the direction of a cryptocurrency market in bullish conditions because of the assumption that increased purchases often follow it.Bitcoin, which was still trading under the key barrier of 71,600 dollars, might change due to this issue, and the same can be said for Ethereum, which is also streaming around these levels. At the moment, sellers are in the top spot (and since this turn of events, bulls have failed to break the resistance and create higher highs), but with recent USDC transactions, investors have established a trend that makes them buy or even sell more crypto. This twist in the story may create necessary circumstances for refinancing and securing better ratings among the investors.Such voting in favor of an asset has not been observed only in this situation: other times when a surplus of the USDC coin has been transferred to Coinbase, prices of cryptocurrencies have risen. Similar effects occurred in January 2023 for a $1.3 billion inflow, followed by a notable increase in Bitcoin costs. USDC Surge and Market DynamicsThe fact that the historical data ultimately turns out to be at least as effective as the current optimism lending weight to what is now booming on the market captures the role of such precedents of history. Moreover, the growing prominence of USDC is reflective of broader trends within the crypto ecosystem. Currently, USDC boasts a market capitalization of $32.5 billion, closely trailing XRP, which holds a market cap of over $34 billion. This tight race underscores stablecoins’ increasing acceptance and utilization as essential tools for facilitating crypto transactions and investmentsXRP, which holds a market cap of over $34 billion. stablecoins as essential tools for facilitating crypto transactions and investments. The Saga between Tether and Bitfinex reflects a major concern around the crypto market: the implications for the broader cryptocurrency market.With 615 million salvaged by one exchange alone, the USDC inflow into Coinbase is more than just a potential boon to the price of Bitcoin and Ethereum; it is a sign that the crypto market is maturing and integrating more into the traditional financial ecosystem. The immediate connection between the substantial flow of stablecoin in the market and the rise in the crypto asset prices cannot entirely be proven because other factors also play a role in the determinants of market dynamics. Nevertheless, such events are a factor that boosts the overall market confidence.

Here’s Where Dogecoin And Shiba Inu Would Be With The Market Cap Of Ethereum | Bitcoinist.com


								Dogecoin and Shiba Inu are trending higher than they were a year ago, but they are still a long way from their 2021 all-time high prices. While they both feature prominently in the top 20 cryptocurrencies by market cap, they are still far below the market cap of Ethereum, the second-largest cryptocurrency by market cap. So, if both DOGE and SHIB attained the market cap of Ethereum, what price would they be trading at?
Dogecoin With The Market Cap Of Ethereum
The Dogecoin market cap is currently sitting $30.7 billon while the price is at $0.214. This makes it the largest meme coin in the space in terms of market cap and puts it ahead of the likes of Shiba Inu. However, if the DOGE market cap were to reach the market cap of Ethereum, the price would trade much higher than it is now.

The MarketCapOf website shows where one cryptocurrency would be trading with the market cap of another, and in this case, it’s Dogecoin compared to Ethereum. If the DOGE market cap were to reach $424 billion, which is the current market cap of ETH, its price would trade at $2.96. Such a price point would mean that the DOGE price would be trading at 1,300% higher than its current price level.

Source: MarketCapOf
Then to take it one step further, the website shows where the Dogecoin price would be if its market cap were to reach the all-time high market cap of Ethereum. This would put it at $3.97 per coin with a market cap of $571.66 billion. It would also be 1,800% higher than its current price.
On the flip side, ETH, with the market cap of DOGE, would mean that the former would be trading at $255.89 per coin. It would be 93% lower than its current price, with a market cap of $30.7 billion.
Shiba Inu With The Market Cap Of Ethereum
Comparing the Shiba Inu price with the market cap of Ethereum leaves a large disparity between its current value and where it will be. As the website shows, SHIB’s price, if it reaches $424 billion, would sit at $0.00071637. Consequently, this would mean a more than 2,300% increase from its current level.

Then, looking at SHIB with the all-time high market cap of ETH puts it at 3,100% higher at $0.0009691. Inversely, Ethereum trading at the market cap of Shiba Inu puts it at a mere $150, which is 96% lower than its current price of $3,500.
This comparison shows the disparity between the assets despite all being some of the largest cryptocurrencies in the space. It also gives investors an idea of what to expect if the price of these coins were to continue growing over time.

Custodia Bank Loses Lawsuit Challenging Fed Rejection of Master Account Application

"Thus, unless Federal Reserve Banks possess discretion to deny or reject a master account application, state chartering laws would be the only layer of insulation for the U.S. financial system," the judge wrote. "And in that scenario, one can readily foresee a 'race to the bottom' among states and politicians to attract business by reducing state chartering burdens through lax legislation, allowing minimally regulated institutions to gain ready access to the central bank's balances and Federal Reserve services."

Crypto Biz: Exchanges face new legal issues, Goldman Sachs’ clients eye crypto, and more

Crypto exchanges are facing a new wave of regulatory hurdles worldwide, with the United States Department of Justice (DOJ) indicting KuCoin and its founders on March 26 for allegedly operating an unlicensed money-transmitting business and violating the Bank Secrecy Act (BSA). The charges coincide with a civil enforcement case by the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC), alleging multiple violations by the exchange. The DOJ claims KuCoin handled over $5 billion in suspicious and criminal funds.Staying in the United States, another setback hit Coinbase on March 27. District Judge Katherine Failla denied the exchange’s motion to dismiss a lawsuit from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), arguing that similar transactions have previously been considered securities transactions. Coinbase sought an order to drop the case, challenging the SEC’s authority over crypto exchanges.In the Philippines, the financial regulator decided to block local users’ access to Binance on March 25, citing concerns over the firm’s unlicensed operations in the country. According to the agency, the exchange offered leveraged trading services and crypto savings accounts to local users without licenses.Meanwhile, in Russia, Binance’s successor, CommEx, has officially announced that it is shutting down operations and has halted deposits. The company acquired Binance’s Russian business for an undisclosed amount in September 2023. Along with the exchanges’ challenges, this week’s Crypto Biz explores BlackRock’s Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) inflows, Goldman Sachs’ clients returning to crypto, SWIFT’s central bank digital currency (CBDC) trials, and Mastercard’s forecasts for remittances in Latin America. BlackRock’s ETF could flip GBTC in Bitcoin holdings within three weeksBlackRock’s spot Bitcoin ETF is on track to surpass the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) holdings in about three weeks, given the current rate of inflows and outflows. As of March 22, BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust ETF held 238,500 Bitcoin (BTC) on its books, worth nearly $15.5 billion at current prices, with daily inflows averaging 4,120 BTC. In contrast, Grayscale’s Bitcoin Trust has 350,252 BTC worth $23 billion but is experiencing average daily outflows of $277 million or 4,140 BTC. In another ETF headline, asset manager Hashdex has officially joined the spot Bitcoin ETF market after completing the conversion of its futures ETF to hold spot Bitcoin. Hashdex renamed and converted its Hashdex Bitcoin Futures ETF to the Hashdex Bitcoin ETF with the ticker “DEFI.”Galaxy Digital reports $296 million net income in 2023 after $1 billion loss in 2022Digital asset management firm Galaxy Digital has reported a net income of $296 million for 2023, marking a reversal after ending 2022 with a $1 billion net loss. The performance shift is due to the rising prices of major cryptocurrencies, such as Bitcoin. The firm’s assets under management grew from $1.7 billion to $5.1 billion in 2023 and nearly doubled in the first two months of 2024, reaching $10.1 billion by the end of February. The firm also reported $18.7 million in mining revenue for the fourth quarter of 2023, a 31% increase over the previous quarter. “Our average marginal cost to mine in the fourth quarter increased relative to prior quarters due to fewer opportunities to economically curtail our mining operations and a higher network hash rate,” the company said in its statement.Goldman Sachs hedge fund clients are piling back into cryptoGoldman Sachs’ clients have started to jump back into crypto, with renewed appetite stemming from the approval of spot Bitcoin ETFs. Max Minton, head of digital assets for Goldman Asia Pacific, told Bloomberg that many of his firm’s largest clients had recently become active or were “exploring getting active” in the crypto sector. Goldman’s options and futures offerings are the primary source of fresh demand, with hedge funds being the most involved among its clients, according to Minton. Goldman’s clients use their derivatives primarily to gain exposure to crypto volatility and to make long-term predictions about prices, said the executive, adding that Bitcoin-related products stood as the most popular investment vehicles among active clients.SWIFT declares second sandbox connector tests a success for CBDC and moreThe SWIFT messaging network has released the results of the second phase of sandbox testing for its CBDC interlinking solution, which it calls a connector. The project looked at four use cases, not all of which involved CBDC, according to the report it released on the test results. It experimented with digital trading with atomic (instantaneous) settlement using smart contracts. It connected tokenization platforms to facilitate atomic delivery versus payment and worked with financial infrastructure firm CLS Group to show the connector’s capability of connecting existing foreign exchange infrastructures using CBDC. SWIFT now plans to further develop the beta version of its connector.Before you go: Mastercard has released a white paper on remittances in Latin America, noting that remittance rates are growing faster than the global average in the region. Digital remittances are expected to be worth $20 billion by 2026.Crypto Biz is your weekly pulse on the business behind blockchain and crypto, delivered directly to your inbox every Thursday.

Buterin Looks Beyond Dencun as 'Blobscriptions' Raise L2 Fees - DailyCoin


        
Inscriptions on blobs are erasing the effects of the Dencun upgrade on Ethereum Layer 2 chains.



Responding to the situation, Ethereum’s Vitalik Buterin has outlined the next steps in the network’s scaling roadmap.



According to Buterin, the focus of scaling improvements is increasingly shifting to Layer 2 chains.
The Dencun upgrade has been hailed as a watershed moment for Ethereum‘s scalability for setting the groundwork for the network’s sharding roadmap and dramatically dropping fees on Layer 2 chains with the introduction of blobs.Less than a month after the upgrade, however, the visible effects of the Dencun upgrade have been all but reversed as inscriptions make their comeback on Ethereum Layer 2 chains. This time, this controversial practice of embedding data on the blockchain has been uniquely reimagined for blobs, earning the portmanteau word “blobscriptions.”The advent of these blobscriptions has highlighted the limitations of blobs in scaling Layer 2 chains: fees will rise with blob space demand. In light of recent events, Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin has explored what comes next in Ethereum’s scaling roadmap, highlighting that there is still more work to be done.Moving Ethereum Scaling From “One-to-N”In a blog post on Thursday, March 28, Buterin contended that following the introduction of blobs, scaling Ethereum was no longer a “zero-to-one” problem but a “one-to-N,” suggesting that the foundation had already been set. With this foundation in place, the developer argued that the focus was gradually shifting from addressing concerns on the Layer 1 chain to the Layer 2 chains.
Nonetheless, Buterin conceded that there was still work to be done in light of recent events. The developer highlighted that the next focus would be realizing data availability sampling (DAS). 
Traditionally, every node in a blockchain downloads the entire network dataset to verify it. However, this is cumbersome and a bottleneck for large chains like Ethereum. DAS has been proposed to lighten this workload performed by nodes by allowing network verification with only small random samples of the entire dataset. Buterin tipped DAS to improve blob space significantly, as nodes would only store a fraction of the blob.Following the implementation of DAS, the Ethereum co-founder disclosed that the scaling focus would shift to Layer 2 improvements to use the available data space better. Some of the recommendations made by Buterin included exploring data compression techniques and Plasma techniques, which only require data to be posted to the Layer 1 chain in exceptional situations. In addition to these, the developer recommended the improvement of execution-related constraints and overall security.On the Flipside
Despite the blobscription craze, Layer 2 fees remain far lower than fees on the Ethereum mainnet.



Proto-danksharding introduced with the Dencun upgrade is just the first step of Ethereum’s danksharding scaling roadmap.
Why This MattersThe statements from Vitalik Buterin suggest that Ethereum’s scaling roadmap is well underway with the Dencun upgrade despite recent hurdles with blobscriptions. At the same time, his statements outline the next steps to be taken to build on the success of the Dencun upgrade.Read this for more on the Dencun upgrade:Here’s Why Coinbase’s Base Metrics Are Booming Post-DencunStay up to date with the latest in the Binance-Nigeria debacle:Binance Exec Fights Nigeria Detention With Human Rights Suit

Bitcoin Halving is 21 Days Away - What Time Will It Happen and What to Expect? Here are the Answers - Bitcoin Sistemi

The fourth Bitcoin halving will take place on April 19, 2024, at approximately 16:30 Turkey time (UTC+3). According to Hashrate Index, this event could have significant impacts on Bitcoin's hashrate depending on BTC price performance.
Hashrate Index estimates that approximately 3-7% of Bitcoin hashrate could be out of action after the halving if Bitcoin's current price maintains or increases moderately. The year-end hashrate value for Bitcoin is expected to be between 639-674 EH/s.


However, if the price of Bitcoin falls from its current level to around $48,000, it is estimated that around 16% of Bitcoin hashrate could go offline.

The report indicates that there may be an anomaly in the upcoming halving compared to previous ones. The current Bitcoin bull market and transaction fee activity have provided many miners with the opportunity to remain viable after the block reward dropped to 3,125 BTC.





According to analysts, if Bitcoin's price stays here or increases, a small amount of hashrate could go offline. If the current trend continues, hashrate is expected to grow slowly over the next year. Compressed margins, exacerbated by the slow but steady increase in mining difficulty, will limit how much of the hashrate can come online and remain profitable.
While the halving will not disrupt miners to the extent previously imagined, margins will still be very thin after the event.


In summary, the BTC price must experience significant increases in order for existing miners to continue their operations profitably. Because when we look at the BTC production cost, it is known that this price will increase significantly.
In past years, halving has been the main factor that started the bull market in Bitcoin. BTC, which has already experienced a significant rise since the beginning of the year with this effect and ETF approval, is expected to enter a serious bull market by mid-2025.

Legal Team Seeks Leniency for OneCoin's Compliance Chief, Advocates for Time-Served Sentence



                    
In a recent legal move, John Buza, representing Irinia Dilkinska, the former “head of legal and compliance” for the infamous OneCoin cryptocurrency scheme, has sought leniency from a U.S. court. 



Dilkinska admitted to her involvement in the OneCoin fraud, pleading guilty to both conspiracy to commit wire fraud and conspiracy to commit money laundering in November 2023. 




These admissions came as part of the fallout from the OneCoin scandal, a cryptocurrency operation unveiled as a sham in 2015, which bilked investors of an estimated $4 billion.



The request for leniency was made in a sentencing memorandum filed on March 20 in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York. 



Buza’s plea centered on the argument that further incarceration for Dilkinska was unnecessary, citing her unique situation and the hardships she faces. 




“I respectfully submits that any sentence more than time-served would be greater that necessary,” Buza emphasized, advocating for a sentence of time served as fitting and appropriate given the circumstances.



Dilkinska’s involvement with OneCoin connected her with co-founders Karl Sebastian Greenwood and Ruja Ignatova, the latter notoriously dubbed the “Cryptoqueen.”

While Greenwood has been sentenced to 20 years in prison with a $300 million restitution order, Ignatova remains elusive, with her whereabouts unknown.



The gravity of Dilkinska’s potential sentence under U.S. law could lead to a decade behind bars, a fate already met by Mark Scott, another OneCoin lawyer found guilty of related charges and sentenced to 10 years in January. 



Ahead of Dilkinska’s sentencing, her defense submitted character letters, highlighting her exemplary behavior in detention and her importance as a family figure, to bolster their case for leniency.



In a related judgment, Konstantin Ignatov, brother of the still-absent Ignatova, received a sentence for time served after 34 months in custody, having pled guilty to money laundering and fraud in 2019. 



This precedent forms part of the context in which Dilkinska’s legal team seeks a similar outcome, arguing against the additional imprisonment for Dilkinska to avoid “a massive injustice,” as Buza stated, emphasizing her role as a “loving wife and mother.”

Bitcoin Runes Coming to Magic Eden After Ordinals Bet Pays Off - Decrypt

Cross-chain NFT marketplace Magic Eden, which recently jumped to the top of the pack amid growing interest in Bitcoin Ordinals, announced Friday that it plans to support the upcoming Runes fungible token standard on Bitcoin.“Ordinals, Rewards, Runes. The Future of BTC is on Magic Eden,” the marketplace tweeted along with a teaser video.The Rune protocol is set to launch on Bitcoin’s mainnet following the halving, which is expected to take place on April 20. The halving is the quadrennial event baked into the Bitcoin protocol that cuts in half the BTC miners receive for supporting the network. The move slows the expanding supply of Bitcoin, and typically also boosts the price of the asset.Runes is a fungible token standard from Casey Rodarmor, the Bitcoin developer who created the Ordinals protocol for inscribing media on the Bitcoin blockchain.While fungible tokens have been available on Bitcoin over the last year via the experimental BRC-20 token standard created on top of Ordinals, Runes is being pitched as a more efficient way of minting and trading tokens on Bitcoin."We think Runes is going to supercharge the Bitcoin ecosystem even further, opening up a new wave of builders and asset types previously only possible on other layer-1 chains,” Magic Eden co-founder and Chief Operating Officer Z Yin told Decrypt.“We have long-term conviction on native Bitcoin activity,” he continued. “It is a no-brainer for us to double down on this ecosystem by adding Runes to our existing Ordinals marketplace, which has already hit $1 billion in volume in 2024 alone."Earlier this year, Magic Eden launched its Diamonds rewards program across all its supported chains, including Bitcoin, Solana, Ethereum, and Polygon. The initiative gives NFT traders point-like Diamonds, both for past and ongoing trades, though it’s still unclear exactly how those Diamonds will benefit users.However, parallel to the Diamonds program, the Non-Fungible DAO—which Magic Eden says is run independently by an external team—plans to launch a fungible token called “NFT” that will be awarded to users of certain open-source trading and minting protocols. All such protocols revealed to date were created by Magic Eden.Amid the Diamonds launch and NFT token teases, along with rising interest in Bitcoin-based assets amid the leading cryptocurrency’s recent surge to all-time high prices, Magic Eden has quickly found fresh footing to become the top overall NFT marketplace by trading volume.Decrypt reported in early March that Bitcoin Ordinals demand had pushed Magic Eden to the top of the pile, with a 38% share of the entire NFT market’s volume in a 24-hour span based on public blockchain data curated by analytics platform Tiexo.That gap has only widened lately. Over the past 24 hours, Tiexo reports that Magic Eden is responsible for over 52% of total trading volume across chains with about $35.6 million worth—and Bitcoin Ordinals trades represent about 69% of that tally.Thursday’s buzzy launch of the Ink project on Bitcoin Ordinals appears to comprise a large chunk of that volume, with $18.8 million worth of transaction volume over the last 24 hours per the marketplace’s data.Over the last seven days, Magic Eden has remained on top—but the Ethereum-centric marketplace Blur has drawn closer during that span. Magic Eden has about 35.7% market share during that period, with Blur at about 32%. Tensor, which has long been Magic Eden’s biggest rival on Solana and plans to debut its own TNSR token soon, has about 7.5% total market share over the last week.Edited by Ryan Ozawa.Stay on top of crypto news, get daily updates in your inbox.

Is MATIC Ready for Lift-Off After Consolidation Phase?


The price of Polygon (MATIC) is witnessing a resurgence, indicated by a recovery in daily active addresses following steep declines. This uptick, supported by the RSI 7D, suggests potential for further buying that could boost MATIC’s price. 
However, caution is advised as EMA lines point towards ongoing consolidation, hinting at a less bullish outlook for MATIC in the near term. Investors should weigh these contrasting signals carefully.
Polygon Active Addresses Are Growing Again
Polygon (MATIC) experienced a significant milestone on March 14, when the number of daily active addresses soared to 3,301, coinciding with a price surge to $1.27, marking its highest value since February 2023. 
This peak reflects a strong correlation between MATIC’s price and its active user base, suggesting that higher engagement levels can drive up MATIC’s price. 
MATIC Daily Active Addresses. Source: Santiment.
However, a subsequent decline in daily active addresses to 2,550 by March 24 indicated a cooling period. Remarkably, from March 24 to March 28, the daily active addresses rebounded to 3,069, with the Daily Active Addresses 7D Moving Average indicating an uptrend. 

This recovery suggests a renewed interest in MATIC, potentially signaling an upcoming price increase. The relationship between active addresses and MATIC’s price is crucial, as rising user engagement often precedes positive price movements, providing a bullish outlook for investors and highlighting the platform’s growing adoption and utility.

RSI Shows Room For Growth
The Relative Strength Index (RSI) for MATIC has seen a notable shift, currently positioned at 59, a decrease from 66 at its price peak on March 13 and down from 62 just two days ago. 
MATIC RSI 7D. Source: Santiment.
This decline in RSI, is a momentum oscillator that gauges the speed and change of price movements. This might signal a cooling period for MATIC’s previous bullish momentum. RSI values range from 0 to 100, with thresholds set at 70 for overbought conditions, indicating a potential price reversal. It also has a threshold of 30 for oversold conditions, suggesting a possible price increase. 

Given that MATIC’s RSI is now at 59, falling from higher values, it likely points towards a period of consolidation. This level suggests that MATIC is neither overbought nor oversold. This indicates that the price might stabilize in the short term as market participants assess its next directional move.
MATIC Price Prediction: EMA Lines Are Not Bullish
Despite the positive indicators from growing daily active addresses and a healthy RSI for MATIC, the EMA (Exponential Moving Average) lines present a less optimistic outlook. EMA lines, which are a moving average that places a greater weight and significance on the most recent data points, are not aligning in a bullish pattern for MATIC price. 
Specifically, MATIC’s short-term EMA lines are situated below its long-term lines, and all are above the current price line. This configuration typically indicates a bearish sentiment, suggesting that the price is under pressure and could be expected to decline if current trends continue.

However, MATIC finds robust support at $0.95 and $0.90, hinting at potential consolidation around these levels from its current price. Should the market sentiment shift negatively, a downtrend could drive MATIC’s price down to $0.81. 
Conversely, a positive change in market dynamics might propel MATIC towards resistance levels at $1.17 and possibly $1.30 if sustained momentum is achieved.

Binance-Linked HKVAEX Withdraws Hong Kong License


																The Hong Kong-based crypto exchange HKVAEX, reportedly associated with Binance, withdrew its license application from the Securities and Futures Commission of Hong Kong (SFC) on March 28th.
HKVAEX announced its intention to apply for a license in October last year while clarifying that it operates as a distinct entity from Binance under BX Services Limited in Hong Kong.
However, there are shared resources between the companies, including the use of Binance servers for content retrieval, as indicated on the exchange’s website.
According to the Securities and Futures Commission (SFC) website, HKVAEX withdrew its license application nearly three months after submission. Following this move, HKVAEX is required to shut down its operations in Hong Kong by May 31.
In recent years, Hong Kong has doubled down its efforts to establish itself as a hub of Web3, as part of which it introduced an updated regulatory framework for cryptocurrencies in June 2023.




The revised rules enabled retail investors to engage in virtual asset trading, eliminating the previous requirement for traders to possess at least $1 million in bankable assets.
The SFC required all crypto exchange platforms intending to operate within the city-state to submit their applications before February 29th.
HKVAEX is not the only one to pull out. In 2024, three other virtual asset trading platforms also withdrew their operational license applications, including the well-known global exchange HTX (formerly known as Huobi).
Meanwhile, OSL and HashKey are currently the only two platforms that have received approval for their licenses from the SFC.

KuCoin Exits Hong Kong Amid US Regulatory Lawsuit


KuCoin’s Hong Kong subsidiary, HKVAEX, withdrew its application for a virtual asset service provider (VASP) license. 
This move reflects the intensifying regulatory scrutiny the cryptocurrency exchange faces globally. Notably, the United States Department of Justice (DoJ) recently accused KuCoin of breaching money laundering regulations.
KuCoin Retracts From Hong Kong
This retreat from the licensing process in Hong Kong hints at a broader recalibration of KuCoin’s compliance efforts amidst mounting regulatory pressures. Industry insiders speculate that the decision to abandon the VASP license application could signal KuCoin’s intention to overhaul its approach to regulatory compliance.

“Three independent sources confirmed that KuCoin considered ceasing operations and selling the exchange in 2023. KuCoin was launched into criminal investigation by the US in 2023, and has also been subject to multiple investigations in China,” Chinese reporter Colin Wu said. 

Moreover, the exchange’s strategic pivot appears influenced by new enforcement actions by US regulatory bodies. These suggest a potential reassessment of KuCoin’s global operational stance. In light of the legal challenges, the anticipation of a possible rejection from Hong Kong regulators may have also played a role.

Commissioner Caroline D. Pham of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) weighed in on the legal actions against KuCoin. In a statement, she highlighted the CFTC’s “aggressive enforcement” stance to protect US investors. 

“The CFTC has filed another aggressive enforcement action exercising our authority to pursue alleged unregistered crypto asset derivatives trading platforms and other violations of law. I commend the Division of Enforcement’s vigilance in protecting our markets,” Commissioner Pham said.

Following these enforcement actions, KuCoin’s reserves of ERC-20 tokens witnessed a dramatic 58% decrease. Indeed, KuCoin reserves plummeted from $1.22 billion to $710 million.

This stark decline reflects the immediate financial impact of the regulatory challenges KuCoin faces. It also emphasizes the exchange’s urgent need to navigate the evolving regulatory environment carefully.

US court favors Fed in Custodia Bank case, rejects appeal for review

The United States district court has ruled against granting Custodia Bank a Federal Reserve master account and has also dismissed the digital asset bank's plea for a declaratory judgment. However, Custodia claims it is not backing down and is exploring all possible avenues.“We are reviewing the Court’s decision and all of our options, including appeal,” a spokesperson for Custodia Bank told Cointelegraph.In a March 29 filing submitted to the United States District Court of Wyoming, Judge Scott Skavdahl dismissed Custodia’s bid to secure a Federal Reserve master account. The account, often referred to as "a bank account for banks," facilitates financial institutions' access to the Federal Reserve’s payment systems.

AVAX - Is it time to bet against it after its drop to $54? - AMBCrypto



AVAX’s instability caused many long liquidations.
If the price hit $58.23, another decline might occur.

It was not good news for traders who opened long Avalanche [AVAX] positions on the 27th of March. According to data from Coinglass, contracts valued at $316,200 were wiped out in the last 24 hours.
Out of these positions, longs accounted for $277,890  while short liquidations stood at $38,310. Liquidation occurs when an exchange forcefully closes a trader’s position.
Source: Coinglass
This happens when the trader does not have the minimum collateral to keep the position open. Other times, the market moving in the opposite direction to the predicted one could trigger it.
Quick swings are bad
For AVAX, a large part of the extermination could be linked to its price action. At press time, AVAX changed hands at $54.60. But on the 27th of March, the price almost reached $55 before volatility hit the market and it retraced to $53.81 in less than two hours.
Furthermore, AMBCrypto evaluated the Long/Short Ratio. The metric indicates if investors have a positive or negative expectation about an asset’s price.
If the value is over 1, then the sentiment is largely positive and traders are expecting a price increase. However, values less than 1 indicate a negative sentiment.
At press time, AVAX’s Long/Short Ratio was 0.95, indicating that the average sentiment was bearish.
When we looked at the metric further, we discovered that only 8% of traders were very bullish on the cryptocurrency. However, a whopping 33% were betting on the price to decrease. The rest were either neutral, slightly bullish, or bearish.
Source: Coinglass
In addition, AMBCrypto analyzed AVAX’s Cumulative Volume Delta (CVD). Typically, the CVD is used to assess traders’ aggression in the market.
At press time, the spot CVD had formed a lower low as the reading was negative. Though CVD does not paint the full picture, the decline implied that perp sellers have become more aggressive.
If the indicator continues to remain negative while the token tries to hit a higher price, longs might not be rewarded. From the technical angle, the 20 EMA (blue) and 50 EMA (yellow) were around the same spot.
Entries appear below $54
This indicates that the price trend was neutral. Also, AVAX has slipped below both EMAs, suggesting that the trend had more chance to be bearish than bullish.
If buying pressure increase, then the token might climb. But the Supertrend flashed a sell signal at $58.23. Therefore, if AVAX rises that high, a pushback might occur.

Conversely, there was a buy signal at $53.96. If the price declines to this point, then it could be a good entry to open a long position.
Regardless of its short-term potential, the token remains one that could perform well this cycle. A major reason for this prediction is the buzzing Real World Assets (RWAs) narrative in which Avalanche’s fundamentals lie.

What's A Simple Strategy For Buying & Selling Bitcoin? This Analyst Answers


                            An analyst has revealed a simple strategy for buying and selling Bitcoin using the historical pattern followed by two BTC on-chain indicators.
These Bitcoin On-Chain Indicators Have Followed A Specific Pattern Historically
In a post on X, CryptoQuant author Axel Adler Jr. discussed a simple strategy for timing buying and selling moves for Bitcoin. The strategy is based on the trend witnessed historically in two BTC on-chain metrics: the Net Unrealized Loss (NUL) and Net Unrealized Profit (NUP).
As their names suggest, these indicators keep track of the total amount of unrealized loss and unrealized profit that the investors are currently carrying.

These metrics work by going through the transaction history of each coin in circulation to see what price it was last transacted at. Assuming that the last transfer of each coin was the last time it changed hands, the price at its instant would act as its current cost basis.
If the previous price for any coin was less than the current spot price of the cryptocurrency, then that coin is currently carrying a profit. The NUP subtracts the two to calculate the exact unrealized gain for the coin.
Similarly, the NUL does the same for coins that have their cost basis above the latest value of the asset. These indicators then sum up this value for the entire supply and divide the sum by the current market cap.
Now, first, here is a chart shared by the analyst for the NUL that reveals a pattern that the metric has been following throughout the history of Bitcoin:

The value of the metric seems to have been heading down in recent days | Source: @AxelAdlerJr on X
The Bitcoin NUL appears to have historically broken above the 0.5 level when the asset’s price has traded around bear market lows. According to Axel, the indicator in this territory would be the moment to buy more.
Recently, the metric has been floating around the zero mark, meaning that there has been any unrealized loss being held by the investors. This makes sense, as the cryptocurrency has set new all-time highs (ATHs). Naturally, 100% of the supply goes into profit when an ATH is set.
Similar to the pattern in the NUL, the NUP has been above the 0.7 level during major tops in the past, suggesting that it may be a good opportunity to sell when the indicator is in this zone.

Looks like the value of the indicator has been climbing up recently | Source: @AxelAdlerJr on X
As is visible in the chart, the NUP has been marching up with the recent rally in Bitcoin. Still, so far, the indicator hasn’t broken above the seemingly important 0.7 level, implying that the market may not yet be in an overheated place where selling would be ideal, at least according to this strategy.
The graphs of the two indicators, though, show that neither of them flagged the exact tops or bottoms in the asset. It’s especially prominent in the data of the NUP, where the metric signaled “sell” during tops that were merely halfway through the bull run.

That said, buying during the points flagged by the NUL and then selling at the overheated NUP values would have historically been profitable. In that sense, this would indeed be a “simple” strategy for the asset.
It remains to be seen, though, whether these patterns will continue to hold in the current Bitcoin cycle as well.

The Chain Abstraction Strategy Could be the Basis for Crypto's Expansion | Cryptopolitan

At the BUIDL Asia conference in Seoul, South Korea, Illia Polosukhin emphasized the importance of blockchain abstraction for mainstream cryptocurrency and Web3 technology. As the founder of the Nearkin protocol, he claims that this strategy facilitates user interaction while hiding complex information about blockchain technology. All in all, this allows a more impactful and greater access to a diverse audience interested in becoming more engaged with emerging technologies.Blockchain made easy for users through chain abstraction strategyThe purpose of abstract blocking is to improve user experience by streamlining network traffic. The latest developments that are taking place in this field allow opening accounts and access using email addresses, replacing complex passwords. Polosuhin said this development can lower the barrier to entry for those interested in the cryptocurrency industry.Although operational simplification offers potential benefits, there are challenges associated with circuit abstraction. While attending the conference, Vitalik Buterin warned users not to ignore security issues as most people do and stressed the importance of increasing flexibility and accessibility in blockchain technology. Although these obstacles have been resolved, Poloshin remains optimistic about future growth by promoting decentralized solutions that prioritize advanced security measures to ensure the growth of our ecosystem.Every critical partner plays a vital rolePolosukhin emphasized the importance of advanced partners such as liquidity providers and various book management specialists. Their involvement plays an important role in decentralization and improving security standards. This organization is important in maintaining the integrity of the ecosystem and can ensure continued growth in expansion.Thinking out of the box: Innovation is the wayThe Treasury recently introduced a new protocol called Chain Signatures that allows users to sign transactions on other notebooks using just one account. This feature is aimed at simplifying interactions with blockchain technology and will be connected to Nearaki’s main network by May 2021. With this development, we are taking another step towards achieving an interconnected and user-friendly blockchain ecosystem that prioritizes access for all.According to Polosuhi, the future will witness the development of blockchain-based services such as decentralized entities and multi-channel DEX, lending platforms and NFT interoperability. This trend is expected to see centralized systems that offer users an efficient way to access multiple offers through one platform.Defense alliance: AI and blockchainIn addition to its impact on user experience, Polosuhin emphasized the importance of blockchain technology in addressing potential threats arising from advances in AI. Risky use by state actors like North Korea has left audiences wondering how to respond to such risks. Simple content and reputation verification systems through cryptography and blocking provide an easy solution to effectively protect against these threats. As such, Blockchain is an important tool to protect the potential of artificial intelligence from misuse now and in the future!ConclusionAt the BUIDL Asia conference, Illia Polosukhin gave insight on how to overcome the challenges faced by blockchain technology to be user-friendly and secure for everyone. Despite its potential drawbacks, the use of chain abstraction appears as an important tactic in simplifying complex chain concepts for lay users.

Solana Whale's Statement Sheds Light on BOME Insider Scandal - DailyCoin


        
Solana whale sparked controversy with 314M BOME purchase ahead of listing.



Previously, Binance launched an insider trading investigation for Book Of Meme.



The whale confesses on Twitter, explaining there were no fraudulent intentions.
The ongoing memecoin season has shown its dark side a few weeks ago, when Book Of Meme (BOME) was listed on Binance, being almost instantly accused of insider trading. On March 15, 2024, a crypto whale was spotted to have withdrawn $2.3 million from Binance, later using these funds to acquire a whopping 314 million of BOME hours ahead of Binance’s listing.Spotted by blockchain tracking agency LookOnChain, this transfer has immediately raised eyebrows, with many crypto traders pointing their fingers at Binance. In response, the crypto giant started an investigation with a huge bounty, offering from $100K to $5M in rewards for information in relation to insider trading.
While Binance’s ‘Rat House’ investigation returned no tangible results, these accusations are refuted by the crypto whale himself, as Solana’s prominent community member BazingaHappy.SOL confessed to the public on X.Since Book Of Meme’s (BOME) inception, the memecoin soared by a whopping 22,472% from an all-time low recorded at $0.00005848 on March 14, 2024. This parabolic bull run reached its peak on March 16, 2024 at $0.02689, as BOME slipped over 50% since the price milestone.Binance Rat House Scandal Debunked: Whale Explains PurchaseThe Solana whale in question acquired 314 million Book Of Meme (BOME) tokens at $0.0074 in half an hour in the afternoon on March 15, 2024. “Does He know something we don’t?”, – asked the on-chain sleuths at LookOnChain, inspiring Binance to start the ‘Rat House’ investigation a few days further.In response to that, BazingaHappy.SOL remarked that he believed in the token to have huge potential, alluding to the rise of Shiba Inu (SHIB) back in 2021. Listed on multiple exchanges in a brief moment, Shiba Inu’s growth back then is compared to BOME’s emergence now.
BazingaHappy.SOL explains: “I didn’t expect that after I bought it at around 10 o’clock that night, BOME would be on Binance the next morning.” On top of that, the Solana whale went as far as to say: “In my opinion, BOME is the leader of memecoins, and in the future it will surpass DOGE.” The trader finished his courageous post by pledging to contribute to BOME’s worldwide adoption.On The Flipside
Despite drawing similarities to Shiba Inu’s (SHIB) emergence back in 2021, the crypto trader also expressed regret about not selling BOME: ”I did not sell, so it fell in the past few days. Afterwards, my friends laughed at me. However, no one is a market prophet.”

First Gaming Roll-Up Chain Launched in Solana by Mirror World | Cryptopolitan

The game industry is on the brink of a much-lauded and praised revolution, thanks to a major breakthrough using Solana’s Layer 1 (L1) technology. With the ability to efficiently handle millions of requests, this development promises unmatched processing speed for games built on the Solana platform.Game play with Sonic SVMA computational virtual machine (SVM) called Sonic is at the heart of this innovative project. The goal is to give developers enough freedom to use any game engine or virtual machine they want in Solana through Mirror World’s advanced software development kit (SDK).Sonic works with HyperGrid, a basic technology that allows gaming platforms to create their own access points and decentralized exchange (DEX) aggregates for Solana-based gaming experiences. This not only makes the experience useful, but also opens up new ways to earn money and participate in the financial ecosystem.Empowering both developers and playersWith 50 game clients deployed as the first distribution point, Mirror World SDK made a big impact. Mahjong Meta, which has earned more than $30 million in Series A, Matr1x Fire, and Seraph / ActozSoft, has increased engagement with more than 200,000 traffic and transaction impressions per game session after integrating the Mirror of the World SDK.“Sonic offers local integration tools to help offset infrastructure costs, as well as user engagement tools needed to successfully run Web3 games,” he said.Chris Su, CEO of Mirror World, focused on Solan’s goal of expanding the existing gaming ecosystem. “Sonic’s goal is to process millions of requests per second and return them to the Solana L1,” Su said. This interest shows the platform’s commitment not only to improve the technical capabilities of the game, but also to develop a healthy space or platform where developers and players can thrive.Solana and Blockchain Solana’s launch has seen its market capitalization grow 824 percent in the past year and solidify its position in the Top-5. Despite its success, playing in Solana has grown slowly compared to Ethereum.In addition to the game, Mirror World also introduced the Smart Marketplace SDK, which allows developers to easily display a non-public token (NFT) market in their decentralized applications. Priced at $299 per month, the service supports monthly transaction volumes of up to $1 million and democratizes entry into the NFT market for developers of all sizes.

Binance Coin (BNB) Secures Serious Breakthrough, Dogelon (ELON) Rallies 22% After Vitalik Buterin's Post, Is Solana (SOL) in Trouble?

Binance Coin stands out with a notable surge, breaking through the crucial resistance level at $584. This breach represents a significant bullish signal for the asset, which could usher in further growth.A close analysis of Binance Coin's recent performance reveals that after hovering below the $584 mark, BNB has displayed considerable strength by not only reaching but also surpassing this threshold.This movement is particularly impressive given the current crypto landscape, which is not witnessing a wide range of assets rallying. The successful breach above this level suggests strong confidence from traders and investors in BNB's potential.Shiba Inu/USDT Chart by TradingViewLooking at the chart, BNB's price has established firm support at $536.2, a level that has been tested and held strong during the last pullbacks. This support level acts as a potential reversal, enabling BNB to gather the necessary momentum to break through resistance levels.On the upside, after the $584 breakthrough, the next notable resistance lies near the $617.2 mark, which BNB is testing at the moment. If BNB can close above this level, it could set the stage for a push toward the next resistance at around $640.Vitalik Buterin pushes DogelonDogelon Mars has become the latest to experience a sharp upswing. The token's value surged by 22%, most likely influenced by a post from Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin.Examining the chart, ELON's price leaped from a support level at approximately $0.000002055, racing past resistance at $0.000002276 and consolidating above it. This upward trajectory follows a period of consolidation, with the price bouncing between the aforementioned support and resistance levels.Currently, the asset has settled around $0.000003678, just a shade below the day's high. Moving forward, should ELON maintain this bullish momentum, the next resistance point to watch is at $0.000004200.A successful close above this level might open the doors for further gains, potentially establishing new highs for the token. On the flip side, should the rally lose steam, the asset could fall back to test the newfound support at $0.000002765.Solana forms symmetrical triangleSolana has recently formed a symmetrical triangle, a pattern suggesting a period of consolidation before a potential breakout and a volatility surge. However, the expected breakout has not materialized as anticipated, prompting questions about SOL's immediate future.A symmetrical triangle typically contains a directional bias dependent upon the preceding trend. For SOL, the trend was upward before entering this consolidation phase.Technically, this would usually point to a continuation pattern, but the market has not witnessed a definitive move yet. This could signal uncertainty or a lack of conviction among buyers and sellers, leaving SOL's next move somewhat vague.At present, Solana's price hovers around $186.54, sitting just below the triangle's upper trendline. If you are waiting for a breakthrough, a close above or at $190 would most likely hint at the bullish development of the pattern. Such a move would need to be supported by rising trade volumes to validate the breakout.The chart shows substantial support at $141.63, a level SOL has not tested since the beginning of its consolidation. In case of the lower border breakthrough, this support level might come into play, offering a potential rebound zone.Solana might start moving either way. Symmetrical triangles are notorious for their neutrality, and the asset’s next direction is often determined by external catalysts or broader market sentiment.

Bank Lets Customers Withdraw More Than Available Balance, Triggering $14,000,000 Exodus in Matter of Hours: Report - The Daily Hodl


								A state-owned bank is clawing back millions of dollars from customers after a “routine system update” allowed people to take out more money than they had in their accounts.
The Commercial Bank of Ethiopia (CBE) says $14 million was drained in a matter of hours as news of the bank’s malfunctioning system spread quickly among customers over messaging apps and via phone calls, reports the Associated Press.










The bank says about 15,000 people withdrew funds that aren’t theirs, with university students taking a majority of the money.
The schools themselves are now imploring their students to contact the bank and return the funds.
So far, the CBE says about 80% of the people who took the easy money have since returned the cash, and the bank is now trying to publicly shame the remaining 567 people who have not done so by listing their names and account details online.
CBE president Abe Sano says the losses are “not significant for the bank, but if this money is not fully recouped, it sends the wrong message.”
The Commercial Bank of Ethiopia is one of the largest banks in Africa with $23 billion in total assets and more than 40 million customers in over 1,940 branches.

Bitcoin Cash (BCH) Surges by 37% in One Week Ahead of Upcoming Halving Event in Early April - The Daily Hodl


								Bitcoin Cash (BCH) has surged by more than 37% in the past seven days ahead of its upcoming halving event.
BCH, a Bitcoin hard fork that spun off from BTC in 2017, is trading at $573.39, up from $418.46 one week ago.










Bitcoin Cash’s halving date is currently slated for April 3rd, according to the hash rate marketplace NiceHash. BCH’s halvings occur every four years, at intervals of 210,000 blocks, and on April 3rd, Bitcoin Cash’s current block reward of 6.25 BCH will be slashed to 3.125 BCH.

Phishing Scam Targeted Decrypt Newsletter Subscribers-Here’s the Latest - Decrypt

Early in the morning of March 27, hackers impersonating Decrypt sent an email to our newsletter subscribers announcing a fictitious token airdrop. As soon as we got wind of the phishing attempt, we sent a follow-up email notifying our readers of the scam. However, in our haste to warn our subscribers, and because of a similar phishing attempt that occurred in January, we incorrectly blamed our email service provider, MailerLite, for this attack. In fact, the hackers had apparently obtained our password key to the service from someone on Decrypt’s side—MailerLite was not at fault. “Due to security reasons, MailerLite does not store information on API keys, therefore, it is not possible to access it in MailerLite’s admin panel or the account in general,” a MailerLite spokesperson told us today. “It means that even though Decrypt Media’s account was affected during the data breach that happened at MailerLite on the 23rd January, 2024, perpetrators were not able to access API keys that could lead to sending of phishing campaigns on 27th March, 2024.”So shame on us for jumping to the wrong conclusion, and we sincerely apologize to MailerLite.We’ve been digging into what happened and will be working with law enforcement. According to MailerLite, “the phishing campaigns were orchestrated via the MailerLite API, originating from the IP address "69.4.234.86" and utilizing the user agent "python-requests/2.31.0." After the intruders accessed our email list, they removed any addresses that ended in decrypt.co or decryptmedia.com so that our staffers wouldn’t be immediately alerted, and sent out their bogus email.Luckily, the vast majority of our readers are wary of these sorts of phishing attempts; only one person attempted to connect their wallet to the bogus address.But that is one too many. As mentioned in our earlier email, crypto scams are all too prevalent in our industry, and getting more sophisticated all the time. Decrypt, along with nearly every other crypto firm, has been impersonated or otherwise used as an attack vector. Hackers have even gone as far as to set up entirely separate websites, fake Discord servers, and social media accounts impersonating our staff. (Note that we have only two domains: decrypt.co and decryptmedia.com—if someone directs you to another domain, beware!)So please be careful out there. And we will, too. Thank you as always for reading Decrypt.Stay on top of crypto news, get daily updates in your inbox.

New Development in the Fate of Kucoin: A Member of the CFTC Speaks Out - Bitcoin Sistemi


Caroline Pham, a commissioner at the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC), has criticized her agency for potentially violating the authority of the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) in its latest accusations against cryptocurrency exchange KuCoin.
On March 26, the CFTC, in cooperation with the US Department of Justice, accused KuCoin of illegally operating a digital asset derivatives exchange. However, Pham expressed concerns about the institution's approach in his statement today.


The CFTC's complaint appears to allege that fund shares held by investors, which are typically considered securities, could constitute leveraged trading under commodity laws, according to Pham. Pham argued that this interpretation does not distinguish between an investment in a fund that falls within the SEC's jurisdiction and the trading activities of a fund that the CFTC claims falls within its jurisdiction.

The issue of jurisdiction between the CFTC and SEC over the crypto industry has become a recurring theme over the past year. The two institutions have publicly disagreed over whether Ethereum is a security or a commodity. While SEC Chairman Gary Gensler refrained from giving a direct answer, he stated that many cryptocurrencies are securities. On the other hand, the CFTC argued that ETH is a commodity, a stance it reiterated in its accusations against KuCoin.

Crypto market set for positive turnaround in Q2: Coinbase exec - Crypto Briefing




Numerous factors could improve the crypto market in Q2; however, positive effects might not be evident until the latter half of April, said David Duong, Coinbase’s Head of Research, in a recent post.
“The setup for 2 Q24 appears more conducive for crypto performance, in our view. That said, we think those positive factors may only manifest themselves more clearly starting in the second half of April,” stated Duong.
According to Duong, despite recent US holidays and corporate financial adjustments, the crypto market has shown surprising stability. However, he anticipates that the approaching tax season might lead investors to sell their holdings, potentially causing a price drop.Duong suggests the recent market volatility is attributed to speculative trading strategies focused on “short MicroStrategy vs long bitcoin trade.” On the bright side, he believes that many concerns identified earlier this month seem to be lessening. This could create a more favorable environment for the crypto market.Duong’s analysis also points to Bitcoin supply-demand dynamics based on two key events: the halving event and the review process for new financial products like spot Bitcoin ETFs. Specifically, he thinks that the conclusion of the review period for spot Bitcoin ETFs by major financial institutions, coupled with continued institutional interest, could boost demand for Bitcoin.
“On the demand side, the 90-day review period that many wirehouses employ when conducting due diligence on new financial offerings – like spot bitcoin ETFs – could conclude as early as April 10,” stated Duong. “We think this could yet unlock significant capital for US-based spot bitcoin ETFs over the medium term.”
“Meanwhile, it seems like institutional interest in this space remains elevated based on the level of leveraged short positions in CME bitcoin futures, which has climbed to a record high of 19,917 contracts as of March 19, according to the CFTC,” added Duong.
On the supply side, the halving event is expected to impact supply dynamics by reducing the rate of new Bitcoin entering the market. If demand remains steady or grows, the price of Bitcoin could potentially increase.

Jerome Powell Says Recession Unlikely as Bitcoin Rises as Hedge


Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell reassured the nation, asserting a strong stance against the looming fear of recession, while Bitcoin gains as a hedge. 
Powell’s confidence stems from analyzing current economic data and trends, disassociating from political influences often cloud economic forecasts. This assertion comes amidst a climate of skepticism toward monetary policy’s role in ensuring long-term economic stability.
Recession Is Unlikely This Year
Jerome Powell’s declaration aligns with his previous comments, underscoring the Federal Reserve’s commitment to data-driven decisions. 
The core PCE, stripping out the volatile costs of food and energy, rose by 2.8% over the past 12 months. Meanwhile, the overall inflation rate stood at 2.5% from the previous year. Powell said that this aligns with his forecasts, and it is encouraging to witness outcomes that meet expectations.
Powell’s optimism, acknowledging a low risk of recession, reflects a pragmatic view of the economy. Moreover, he downplayed the possibility of reducing interest rates until the “Federal Open Market Committee is confident that inflation is moving down to 2% on a sustained basis.”

“Growth is strong. As I mentioned, the economy is in a good place. And there’s no reason to think the economy is in a recession or is at the edge of one,” Powell said.

This perspective redirects focus towards structural elements of economic growth, away from the short-term effects of monetary adjustments.

While Powell maintained that a recession is unlikely this year, Bitcoin benefits from the uncertain fiscal and monetary environment. 
Jason Trennert, CEO Strategas Research Partners, attributed this to recent regulatory advancements and the growing desire for alternatives to traditional fiat currencies. The approval of a Bitcoin ETF and the simultaneous rise in gold prices reflect a collective hedge against the debasement of the US dollar. 

“In the US, there’s really no coordination between fiscal and monetary policy when it comes to inflation. And I think people are looking for hedges against fiat currencies, particularly the dollar. So I think that’s another reason why people are looking for alternatives to what would traditionally be, again, seen as, as fiat currencies,” Trennert explained.

As Powell steers the monetary helm with a steady hand, the conversation around Bitcoin’s viability as a safe haven intensifies. With the US grappling with a ballooning national debt and the looming reevaluation of debt terms, Bitcoin’s role as a potential bulwark against fiscal instability has gained traction.

Crypto Open Interest At All-Time High: Explosive Move Soon?


								Data shows the total open interest in the crypto sector has recently been at an all-time high, indicating that volatility may be coming for the coins.
Crypto Open Interest Has Been At Extreme Levels Recently
As CryptoQuant Netherlands community manager Maartunn pointed out in a post on X, the total crypto open interest has recently been sitting around a whopping $51.3 billion.
The “open interest” here refers to the total amount of derivative positions related to all digital assets currently open on the various exchanges in the sector.

When the value of this metric rises, it means that the investors are opening up fresh positions on the market right now. Generally, the total leverage in the sector goes up when such a trend takes form, so the assets could become more likely to show some volatility.
On the other hand, a downtrend in the indicator implies that the investors are closing their positions of their own volition or getting forcibly liquidated by their platform.
A sharp plunge in the metric could accompany some violent price action, but once the indicator’s value has settled down, the markets could become more stable due to a washout of leverage.
Now, here is a chart that shows the trend in the crypto open interest over the past few years:

The value of the metric appears to have been going up in recent days | Source: @JA_Maartun on X
As displayed in the above graph, the total open interest in the crypto sector has been riding an uptrend recently. This rise in the metric has come as the prices of Bitcoin and other assets have gone through their rallies.
This isn’t unusual, as the market attracts much attention during such price action. With a large amount of attention naturally comes speculation, so users flood exchanges with positions in these periods.
From the chart, it’s visible that open interest in the crypto market also rose during the 2021 bull run. The latest values of the indicator, however, have already surpassed the peak witnessed back then.
The metric has recently been around $51.3 billion, an all-time high. As mentioned before, high metric values can lead to volatility for the various assets in the sector.

As such, the current extreme levels of open interest could mean that the market may be prone to seeing some sharp price action in the near future. This volatility could take the market in either direction, at least on paper.
As is apparent from the graph, though, the indicator has historically only seen a significant cooldown with crashes in the Bitcoin price, so the current overheated open interest may be a bad sign for the crypto market.
Bitcoin Price
At the time of writing, Bitcoin is floating around the $70,100 mark, up more than 9% over the past week.

$10 Million in Stolen Ether Moved to Crypto Mixer in Aftermath of Phishing Attack



                    
In a notable development within the cryptocurrency security landscape, a blockchain security firm, CertiK, reported on March 21 that an account implicated in a major phishing scam in September 2023 has recently transferred $10 million worth of Ether to Tornado Cash, a crypto-mixing protocol. 



This account was part of a larger hack totaling $24 million, originating from an attack on a significant cryptocurrency investor, or “crypto whale,” on September 6, 2023.




The victim of this phishing attack lost a substantial amount of staked Ether (ETH) through the liquid staking provider Rocket Pool. 



The attackers managed to siphon funds in two separate transactions, extracting 9,579 stETH and 4,851 rETH respectively. 



According to Scam Sniffer, an anti-scam initiative, the breach occurred when the victim approved an “Increase Allowance” transaction, inadvertently granting the hackers permission to access their ERC-20 tokens via a token allowance mechanism—a feature that enables third parties to spend tokens on behalf of the token holder.




The conversation around token allowances has been prominent within the cryptocurrency community, with many voicing concerns over the potential for misuse through the deployment of malicious smart contracts.



Further investigation by another blockchain security firm, PeckShield, revealed that the fraudsters converted their illicit gains into 13,785 ETH and 1.64 million Dai, dispersing a portion of these funds through the FixedFload exchange and other digital wallets.

This incident underscores the persistent risk of phishing scams in the cryptocurrency domain, which continue to result in significant financial losses. 



A recent report by Scam Sniffer highlighted that nearly $47 million was stolen through crypto phishing in February alone, with the majority of these incidents occurring on the Ethereum network and primarily involving ERC-20 tokens.



Moreover, token approvals emerged as a focal point of vulnerability once again on March 20, when an outdated contract from the Dolomite exchange was exploited to withdraw $1.8 million from unsuspecting users. 



This incident prompted Dolomite’s developers to advise users to revoke any permissions granted to the compromised contract address.



While the cryptocurrency community has seen its share of successful security interventions, such as the Layerswap team’s quick response to a breach on March 20, preventing further losses after hackers had already extracted about $100,000 from 50 users, these episodes serve as a stark reminder of the ongoing challenges and risks associated with digital asset security.

The Biggest Crypto Predictions for April 2024


April is expected to be a big one for the crypto market as a major event in the Bitcoin (BTC) halving is scheduled. This will also have an impact on other assets, such as Solana (SOL) and Fantom (FTM).
BeInCrypto looks at the ongoing market movements and where you can expect these assets to land.
Bitcoin Will Likely Climb to $77,000
Bitcoin price marked a fresh all-time high of $73,750 earlier this month, and since then, the cryptocurrency has been on a decline. This resulted in the cryptocurrency forming a flag pattern on the 4-hour chart. The cryptocurrency broke out of the pattern earlier this week and is presently trading at $70,151.
Per the bullish flag pattern, the target price is set at almost $77,000, which will be achieved as long as the $69,715 support line is sustained.

This outcome is very likely since Bitcoin halving is scheduled to take place on April 22. The anticipation ahead of the event will drive prices higher, potentially validating the pattern as well.

However, if the support of $69,715 is lost, there is a good chance Bitcoin price could slip back to $66,500, effectively invalidating the bullish thesis.
Solana (SOL) to Make It Big Thanks to Two Major Factors
Solana’s price is among the best-performing cryptocurrencies in the market at the moment, and this growth is only going to snowball in April. The reason behind this is the support SOL is receiving from institutional investors.
Per the CoinShares weekly netflows report, Solana outperformed every other altcoin, including Ethereum, to emerge as the institution’s preferred asset, noting $18 million worth of inflows this month.
Additionally, Solana-based DEX Jupiter performed exceptionally this month. The decentralized exchange rose to become the biggest DEX in the market based on volume, pushing the monthly DEX total transaction volume to a new all-time high of $241.97 billion.
Thus, Solana’s price will likely witness the influence of these developments to propel itself beyond $200. Furthermore, SOL is already testing the 61.8% Fibonacci Retracement as support, which is also known as the bull run support floor.

This could push the altcoin to note a 35.88% rally and tag the resistance at $250.

Nevertheless, losing the $186 support floor could cause a decline to $164, essentially eliminating the possibility of a rally.
Fantom (FTM) Will Take the Bearish Route
Fantom price is not expected to rise in the coming month, unlike the rest of the assets on this list. The reason behind this is that FTM is poised for a 20% correction according to the parabolic curve pattern.
Per the pattern, a drawdown to the base 3 price level is expected, given FTM failed to breach the $1.12 resistance.

Substantiating this outcome are the Relative Strength Index (RSI) and Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD). These indicators highlight bearishness taking precedence, with the latter noting a bearish crossover for the first time in two months.

Thus, FTM will probably witness a drawdown where it will lose the $0.80 support and decline further.

However, should Fantom’s price bounce back from the base 3 support range, it would have a shot at invalidating the bearish thesis.

X Payments' Lack Of License Casts Doubt on Crypto Support - DailyCoin


        
X Corp has recently made remarkable progress in acquiring money transmitter licenses for its payments feature. 



The crypto community is growing increasingly excited about digital assets making their way into the P2P system. 



However, there appears to be a crucial piece missing from the puzzle. 
Elon Musk’s X (formerly Twitter) is soon to roll out its highly anticipated in-app payment feature as it sets the stage for its grand debut by securing essential licenses. Given the Chief Twit’s pro-crypto inclinations and affinity for Dogecoin, the crypto community is optimistic over the prospect of digital assets also finding their place in Musk’s all-in-one app. However, while X lays the groundwork for its upcoming peer-to-peer (P2P) financial ecosystem, there looms a lingering sense of uncertainty surrounding cryptocurrencies making it into the app. X Payments Yet to Apply For Crypto LicenseX Corp has been making remarkable progress lately, acquiring money transmitter licenses across various US states in preparation for the launch of its X payments feature. At the time of writing, X has secured licenses in 22 out of the 50 states, with New Mexico, Oregon, and Illinois being the latest additions to the list.
The crypto community, especially Dogecoin holders, is becoming increasingly excited with each state added to the list as they anticipate the integration of crypto into the social media app. However, while expectations reach unprecedented heights, there seems to be a crucial piece missing from the puzzle: a Virtual Currency Business License or the BitLicense. Screenshot from BitLicense requirements. Source: NYDFS.Under the New York Banking Law and similar regulations in states like Louisiana, businesses like X Corp must acquire a separate BitLicense, in addition to the money transmitter license, to engage in virtual currency-related activities such as cryptocurrency transmission. 
Although X Corp has applied for money transmitter licenses in these states, it has yet to apply for a virtual currency license in jurisdictions that necessitate one. Meanwhile, its competitors, including Robinhood, PayPal, Coinbase, and eToro, have already obtained virtual currency business licenses.The lack of an application for the virtual currency license from X Corp pours cold water on the ambitions of crypto enthusiasts, particularly Dogecoin holders. Dogecoin’s Support on X Payments UncertainGiven Musk’s vocal support for Dogecoin, often heralding the top dog coin as the ‘people’s crypto,’ DOGE stood as a prime candidate for integration into the X payments feature. Naturally, Dogecoin’s market value has consistently responded positively to any updates related to the upcoming X payment features, fueled by anticipation of the memecoin being included in the app. Previously, when the social media giant announced receiving approval in the most recent three rates, DOGE surged by a remarkable 10%. However, considering the absence of applications to set the necessary legal groundwork for integrating cryptocurrencies in the X Payments app, crypto enthusiasts might have to reconsider their enthusiasm. On the Flipside
X recently struck a deal with eToro to enable users to buy digital assets on the social platform via plugins. 



The X Payments feature is scheduled for release in mid-2024, leaving a window of opportunity for the social media giant to potentially apply for crypto integration.



Dogecoin is up 200% this year. 
Why This MattersAs a social media giant with billions of users, X had a golden opportunity to drive crypto adoption and reshape the industry by integrating cryptocurrencies into its payments feature. However, the lack of applications to handle digital assets suggests the social media giant isn’t satisfying the expectations of crypto enthusiasts anytime soon. Why is ADA struggling to bounce back?Cardano (ADA) Struggles to Recapture $0.7 While BTC Tops $70KCrypto hackers steal over $300 million this year:Crypto Hackers Siphon Over $300 Million in Q1 2024, Immunefi

New ‘Voice Engine’ from OpenAI Needs Only 15 Seconds to Clone Speech - Decrypt

OpenAI, the AI company behind dominant generative AI tool ChatGPT, has unveiled a new voice cloning technology it calls "Voice Engine." This audio model can replicate a person's voice, intonation, and other distinctly human speech patterns based on a relatively small sample of original audio."It is notable that a small model with a single 15-second sample can create emotive and realistic voices," the company says in its Friday blog post.For comparison, AI voice platform ElevenLabs features an instant voice cloning tool that requires samples of at least one minute. For best results, nearly 10 minutes of continuous speech is needed  for its professional service level.The company showed different examples of what this technology is capable of doing. In one example, the voice of a young patient who lost much of her ability to speak due to a vascular brain tumor was cloned using an older recording she made for a school project. This is how she sounds today, according to OpenAI.
OpenAI worked with Lifespan, a nonprofit affiliated with the medical school at Brown University and the creators of a tool called Livox, an “alternative communication app” built for people with disabilities. The team was able to work with a recording that the woman made for a school presentation:
The Open AI Voice Engine was then able to provide instant text-to-speech capability that would allow the patient to effectively speak with her own voice:
OpenAI also showcased how HeyGen is using its technology to generate natural-sounding translations of speech uploaded in a specific language in another language.The company says Voice Engine was first developed in late 2022 and is already being used to power the preset voices available in OpenAI's text-to-speech API, as well as ChatGPT’s Voice and Read Aloud feature. With the latest advancements, the company says it's being cautious before a broader release.”We hope to start a dialogue on the responsible deployment of synthetic voices and how society can adapt to these new capabilities," OpenAI wrote, acknowledging the widely condemned practice of “deepfakes.”  The voices of celebrities, government officials, and increasingly private citizens are being impersonated for nefarious purposes, from political campaigns, fake ads and outright criminal activities. U.S. President Joe Biden has been pushing for more safeguards against the malicious use of AI voice impersonations.In fact, Meta disclosed last summer that its AI voice tool was being held back specifically because of the “potential risks of misuse.”"In line with our approach to AI safety and our voluntary commitments, we are choosing to preview but not widely release this technology at this time," OpenAI explained.Even before public release, OpenAI is placing restrictions on Voice Engine—including a list of prominent people that it will not emulate."We believe that any broad deployment of synthetic voice technology should be accompanied by voice authentication experiences that verify that the original speaker is knowingly adding their voice to the service and a no-go voice list that detects and prevents the creation of voices that are too similar to prominent figures," OpenAI wrote.The partners testing Voice Engine today have agreed to OpenAI's usage policies, which prohibit the impersonation of another individual or organization without consent. In addition, the company requires explicit and informed consent from the original speaker, and they don’t allow developers to build ways for individual users to clone their own voices.“Based on these conversations and the results of these small scale tests, we will make a more informed decision about whether and how to deploy this technology at scale,” the blog post reads.In addition to Voice Engine, Open AI is working on multiple projects in parallel. CEO Sam Altman revealed that the company is working on releasing GPT-5 this year. The company also showed off its generative video tool Sora. The company claims that Sora will be the most advanced video generator on the market, surpassing models like Pika, Stable Video Diffusion, and Runway ML.Sora is currently only available to “red teamers” enlisted by Open AI to make sure it cannot be abused.Voice Engine could certainly outperform other voice cloning tools, including offerings from Meta, ElevenLabs,  WellSaid Labs, and open-source models like RVC.Open AI is also working on a secret project named Q* of which only its name has been leaked. Sam Altman has refused to give any details, but said the research team was heavily focused on finding techniques and approaches that make AI reason better.Edited by Ryan Ozawa.Stay on top of crypto news, get daily updates in your inbox.

Toncoin: What metrics tell you about TON’s April price prediction - AMBCrypto



Network activity decreased, indicating low demand for TON.
A notable announcement did not affect Toncoin’s development activity in a good way.

Toncoin’s [TON] native token was one of the cryptocurrencies with an eye-catching performance this week. At press time, the price of TON was $4.82, which constituted an 8.34% increase.
However, AMBCrypto’s analysis showed that the upward trajectory could break off. Findings showed that activity on the Toncoin blockchain was at impeccable heights on the 26th of March.
TON is stuck in a rut
But when we checked the data at press time, things had changed. As of this writing, the 24-hour active addresses on the network were nowhere near the peak mentioned above.
Active addresses indicate the daily level of interaction users have with a project. If the metric increases, then there is a high number of unique addresses involved in transactions.
Therefore, the decrease in network activity suggests that demand for TON had reduced. Price-wise, a decrease in demand is a bearish signal. Hence, if the activity remains low, Toncoin’s price action could be affected negatively.
One other metric fueling the bearish thesis was the Gini Index. For the uninitiated, the index measures the distribution of coins across addresses.
Source: Santiment
Typically, a decreasing Gini Index is a sign that token holders are cashing out. On the other hand, an increase suggests accumulation.
At press time, TON’s index had decreased from the point it was on the 24th of March. If we go by the definition above, it implies that participants’ perception of the token was no longer optimistic.
If this lack of confidence continues, TON’s price might undergo a correction. However, bullish sentiment still exists due to a recent development centered around the project.
It’s open season on the network
On the 27th of March, 21 Shares, the world’s largest issuer of ETPs, announced that it had launched a Toncoin Staking ETP. ETP stands for Exchange Traded Products, and they represent financial instruments pooled into an exchange.
According to the official statement, the firm noted that Toncoin’s decentralized and open network nature made it a suitable option. It said,
“With our ETP, investors can now enjoy the benefits of staking Toncoin while leveraging the liquidity and convenience of traditional financial markets.”
Despite the launch, development activity on the network stalled. As of this writing, Santiment showed that the development activity metric was flatlined at 0.0059. This was proof that Toncoin had not made a significant upgrade of late.

Should this stay the same, TON’s price could fail to hit $5.61 as it did a few days ago. In the meantime, traders were at loggerheads about the price potential.
For some, TON might experience a short-term downtrend. However, the bullish side believes that the development team would be able to attract more users and help TON’s adoption scale.

Dogwifhat (WIF) Price Headed for $4.70?


Dogwifhat (WIF) leads as Solana’s largest memecoin, surpassing PEPE’s market cap. However, it still falls short of DOGE and SHIB. A recent uptick in its value has been noted. At the same time, its 7-day RSI has slightly decreased. This combination suggests a chance for more price growth. 
Furthermore, EMA lines are showing a consistent upward trend. This trend hints at a positive future. It implies WIF’s price could soon exceed the $4.7 mark.
Despite Its Growth, WIF Is Still Behind Other Memecoins
WIF has established itself as the leading memecoin in the Solana blockchain ecosystem. It showcases a market capitalization that significantly outshines that of its nearest rival, BONK, by a factor of two. 
The memecoin has seen an extraordinary surge of more than 2,000% in the year 2024 alone, skyrocketing from a humble beginning at $0.17 on January 1 to an astonishing $3.75 by March 29. WIF price YTD growth eclipses the growth of other well-known memecoins, such as FLOKI, which has seen a 558% growth, and PEPE, with a 455% increase.

With a staggering 66.22% growth in the last seven days, WIF is now the third-largest memecoin by market capitalization, surpassing PEPE. Despite this monumental achievement, the WIF market cap remains five times smaller than SHIB.

The growing and dynamic Solana memecoin ecosystem suggests WIF’s price could climb even higher.

Despite Its Growth, WIF RSI Still Shows Potential
The price of WIF increased between March 28 and March 29. However, its 7-day Relative Strength Index (RSI) experienced a slight decrease, moving from 86 to 85. 
The RSI measures price momentum on a 0 to 100 scale. An RSI above 70 suggests an overbought, potentially overvalued asset likely to pull back. An RSI below 30 indicates an undervalued asset poised for a rebound.
WIF RSI 7D. Source: Santiment.
The slight reduction in WIF’s RSI amidst a price increase suggests that while the price is growing, the momentum behind its rise is not excessively overheated, allowing room for further growth without immediate overvaluation concerns. 

This is particularly bullish for WIF’s price outlook, especially considering that the last instance of a day-to-day drop in WIF’s 7-day RSI was followed by a remarkable surge of over 100% in its price within the subsequent two weeks, indicating the potential for a repeat performance.
WIF Price Prediction: Can It Cross $4.70 In April?
The analysis of WIF 4-hour price chart reveals an encouraging sign for investors: all Exponential Moving Average (EMA) lines are positioned below the current price line, with short-term lines standing above the long-term lines and a noticeable gap between them. 
This configuration is typically considered bullish, indicating strong current momentum and a healthy trend upwards. EMAs are a moving average that places a greater weight and significance on the most recent data points, making them more responsive to new information and price changes than simple moving averages. This sensitivity to recent price movements helps traders identify trend direction more swiftly and accurately.

WIF 4H Price Chart and EMA Lines. Source: TradingView. 
EMA lines positioned with short-term above long-term, all below the price, indicate WIF is on a strong uptrend. This suggests possible continued growth. Considering history, where an RSI drop triggered over a 100% price jump in two weeks, WIF could target $4.70 if trends hold.

Yet, caution is advised. A potential downtrend could see WIF fall to $2.12. This highlights the need to watch market signals and adjust strategies as needed.

Grayscale Unveils New Staking-Focused Income Fund Exclusively For High Net-Worth Individuals | Bitcoinist.com


								Asset management firm and spot Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) issuer Grayscale has unveiled its latest offering, the “Dynamic Income Fund” (GDIF), designed to focus on investments in proof-of-stake tokens.
Grayscale Launches Dynamic Income Fund
This actively managed investment product seeks to optimize returns through staking rewards associated with proof-of-stake digital assets, according to the asset manager’s announcement on Friday. 
Friday’s announcement also illuminates the fund’s key steps, which include raising capital from investors, allocating capital to a portfolio of proof-of-stake tokens using qualitative and quantitative factors, staking tokens to earn rewards, converting token rewards to cash on a weekly basis, and distributing cash to investors every quarter while rebalancing tokens as needed to maximize income.

Grayscale has hinted that the GDIF will initially include tokens such as Osmosis (OSMO), Solana (SOL), Polkadot (DOT), and other tokens to be announced.
However, the asset manager clarifies that the holdings are subject to change at the manager’s discretion, and the percentages allocated to each token may not sum up to 100% due to rounding.
To provide a deeper understanding of Grayscale’s new venture, staking involves investors actively validating blockchain network transactions and earning staking rewards in transaction fees for their services. To stake, investors commit a certain amount of their tokens to the network, enabling them to contribute to its security and governance.
Grayscale aims to simplify the complexities associated with staking and unstacking multiple tokens, as each token has its unique requirements and timelines for staking and unstacking. 
It’s worth noting that GDIF is exclusively available to qualified clients, defined as individuals with assets under management of $1,100,000 or a net worth of $2,200,000. 
Bitcoin ETF Market Shows Strong Rebound
According to recent data from BitMEX research, the Bitcoin ETF market has witnessed significant developments in the past few days. Notably, the outflows of $887 million reported last week have nearly reversed, indicating a renewed investor interest. 
Grayscale, one of the prominent players in the space with its GBTC ETF, saw minimal outflows of just $104.9 million on Thursday, the lowest since March 12, as shown in the chart below.

In contrast, Grayscale’s competitors have demonstrated strong performance, recording net inflows of $844 million in only four days. On March 28, Blackrock’s ETF IBIT emerged as the frontrunner, witnessing substantial gains with $95.1 million in inflows. Fidelity’s FBTC followed with $68 million in inflows on the same day. 

However, it is worth noting that these figures are significantly lower than the best-recorded days for both asset managers. Blackrock’s ETF IBIT reached its peak on March 12, surpassing $849 million in total inflows. Similarly, Fidelity’s FBTC experienced its highest inflow on March 7, reaching $473 million.
BitMEX research data further reveals that the cumulative flow of the Bitcoin ETF market has approached $12.5 billion within just three months since trading commenced on January 11.

Bitcoin Sharks Show Biggest Monthly Buying Spree Since 2012


								On-chain data shows the Bitcoin shark cohort has participated in its largest accumulation spree over the past month since 2012.
Bitcoin Sharks Have Purchased More Than 268,000 BTC In The Last Month
As analyst James Van Straten explains in a new post on X, Bitcoin entities holding between 100 and 1,000 BTC have made some large net buying moves in the past month.

An “entity” here refers to a collection of addresses owned by the same investor as determined through analysis by the on-chain analytics firm Glassnode.
The entities holding between 100 to 1,000 BTC are popularly known as “sharks.” At the current exchange rate of the asset, this range converts to about $6.93 million to $69.3 million.
Thus, the investors carrying these amounts are clearly quite big, meaning that they should have some significance for the market as a whole. However, these sharks are still smaller and less influential than the whales, who typically occupy the range above 1,000 BTC.
Given the relevance of the sharks, their behavior is naturally worth monitoring. One way to track this behavior is through the “net position change” of the cohort.
This on-chain metric keeps track of the net amount of supply that entered into or exited out of the wallets of the entities belonging to the shark group over the past month.
The chart below shows this indicator’s trend over the entire history of the cryptocurrency.

The value of the indicator appears to have been quite high in recent days | Source: @jvs_btc on X
As the above graph shows, the Bitcoin shark net position change has been at highly positive levels recently. This would imply that these large investors have been adding a net number of coins to their wallets.
The sharks have made net purchases amounting to around 268,441 BTC in the last 30 days, which is currently worth almost $18.6 billion. This is a staggering amount and is the largest accumulation these holders have done since way back in 2012.
Back then, BTC’s price was a small fraction of what it is today so that the current shark accumulation would be the most impressive in the asset’s history based on the sheer amount of capital involved.
With such a high degree of accumulation, it’s no wonder that the past month has been a positive one for Bitcoin, where its price has reached new all-time highs.

Another positive development in the market recently is perhaps the outflows that the cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase has observed, as Straten has pointed out in another X post.

According to the analyst, $1.1 billion worth of the asset was taken off the platform’s wallets yesterday, the third biggest net outflow this year, with all of the top three occurring within the past month.
Exchange outflows can be a bullish sign for the cryptocurrency, as they suggest that investors prefer to go into self-custody, possibly to HODL onto their coins for extended periods.
BTC Price
Bitcoin’s price has gone a bit stale over the past few days as it has been unable to pick any direction. At present, BTC is trading at around $69,400.

Where Is Your Seed Phrase - The Daily Hodl


								
 
The phrase ‘MetaMask lost seed phrase‘ is consistently present in search engines throughout the year. Clearly, despite multiple disclaimers and warnings, the issue is faced by many.
So, before we begin, answer this question – do you remember where your seed phrase is?
What we know about seed phrases
Every new owner of a cryptocurrency wallet goes through the process of recording a combination of words – a seed phrase. This phrase serves as the key to restoring access to the wallet if you ever fail to log in.
A seed phrase is never a logical sentence or a quote – it’s a string of 12 to 24 random words. They are selected out of a 2,048-word dictionary, and each one corresponds to a number.
The seed phrase is used to generate public-private key pairs with BIP32 or BIP44 algorithms, and these pairs are stored in your device’s memory.
During registration, you always see a reminder that the seed phrase should be written down and kept somewhere safe.
If anything happens, this is the only way to restore your wallet and regain access to your funds.
I’m ready to keep it safe
The cautionary tale of Stefan Thomas only reminds us about the worst possible outcome.
The former CTO of Ripple made headlines when he was left with two remaining attempts to enter the correct password to his IronKey-encrypted flash drive.
According to different sources, the drive contained from $220 million to $240 million worth of Bitcoin (BTC).
If this story didn’t make you want to revisit your seed phrase, it’s hard to imagine something else would.
But forgetting your wallet password is only one common reason to look for your seed phrase.
The others include losing or misplacing the device that holds the wallet or having a malfunctioning one.
If you encounter one of these issues, you are guaranteed to have to look for the seed phrase, and let’s agree that knowing where and how to locate it is much safer than frantically searching high and low.
There are two ways to store a seed phrase – digital and physical. While neither one is perfect, we will tell you about the best practices.
Digital storage
Low security – writing it in a document
Just writing down your seed phrase is dangerous. Not only will anyone in the vicinity of your computer would be able to access it – but it could be accessed by hackers or accidentally deleted.
Medium security – writing it in a document and encrypting it
If you choose to store your seed phrase digitally, you need to think about encrypting it.
The easiest option is to write it down in a file and use encryption software. The file cannot be read by anyone else, but it can still be deleted by accident, especially if other people can access your computer.
There is a more advanced form of encoding that doesn’t require additional tools – saving excerpts that include a word from the seed phrase.
For instance, you can keep them in notes or saved messages. This allows you to be the only one who knows how to decode the phrase.
Good security – uploading the encrypted file to Dropbox
A better solution is to upload the file to Dropbox or another cloud service, so you always have a backup copy online. However, you should also be aware that cloud services can be hacked or unavailable sometimes.
It is wise to copy the file to multiple cloud services and also have a physical storage device, such as a flash drive. This way, you reduce the risk of losing your seed phrase.
But the more copies you have, the less secure they are. You may expose yourself to phishing attacks or theft of your seed phrase.
High security – using an encrypted hidden container
If you want to add another layer of security, you could create a hidden container with double encryption and store it in the cloud.
This means that you need two passwords to access your data. One password will reveal one version of the data, and another password will reveal a different version.










Physical storage
Low security – a paper wallet
A paper wallet is a piece of paper with the seed phrase written on it, stored in a secure place. This protects you from online hackers but not from losing or damaging the paper.
A more advanced method is to engrave the seed phrase on a metal plate. This makes it resistant to fire and water – but not to theft.
Medium security – different hiding places
To prevent unauthorized access to the seed phrase, you can also divide it into several pieces and hide them in different locations.
While it’s a safety measure, it creates another challenge – the risk of losing some of the pieces.
High security – smart wallet
Another option that helps you manage your seed phrase is a smart wallet.
It lets you split your seed phrase into several pages, and you only need some of them to recover the whole phrase.
For example, you can have three pages and need two of them or seven pages and need four of them. You can print the pages, which have clear instructions on how to restore the data.
The redundancy algorithm ensures that some pages are extra, but you can still restore the data if you lose them.
Some smart wallets use RAID5 disk-based storage, which is still widely used in data centers.
This is the most comprehensive solution for storing your seed phrase.
But remember that the pages should be kept apart – ideally, in different places where only people you trust can access them.
It would be safer to be the only one who knows where the pages are, but if you are away and need to restore your seed phrase, it is good to have someone who can help.
The most advanced practices
Well, now that you know almost all there is to know about the safekeeping of a seed phrase, let’s talk about preventing unauthorized access.
First and foremost, you should probably involve both digital and physical methods of storing the seed phrase. Additional security hasn’t hurt anyone so far.
Now, let’s come back to the core of a seed phrase. It’s a string of words, and there’s a finite number of them.
So, every once in a while, these words switch places and provide an entirely new seed phrase.
Let’s imagine we have two wallets with two seed phrases – wallet one – ABCDE – and wallet two – CDBAE.
Keep in mind, that for this, you’d have to search for these wallets.
We store the wallet one seed phrase with extra advanced security measures so it seems like this wallet is the main one.
We put $100 on wallet one and $100,000 on wallet two – then we wait and watch.
If a hacker breaks through all the security measures in the first wallet, they take the $100 and either quit or continue on their quest.
Meanwhile, we become aware that there has been a breach and have enough time to move our $100,000 to a safer place.
It’s a complex security measure that requires a lot of effort – yet, for now, this is one of the better measures.
We have discussed two different ways to store your seed phrase for a crypto wallet. They both have different steps and security levels, and they both have pros and cons.
You have to pick the one that matches your needs and preferences.

Voice Engine: OpenAI's Breakthrough in Synthetic Speech | Cryptoglobe


                                
OpenAI, a prominent artificial intelligence research organization, published a blog post on March 29, discussing their latest development: Voice Engine. This model, created in late 2022, can generate natural-sounding speech that closely resembles the original speaker using only a 15-second audio sample and text input. While the technology is impressive, OpenAI is cautious about its broader release due to the potential for misuse.



Voice Engine has already been used in various applications, such as powering preset voices in OpenAI’s text-to-speech API and enhancing ChatGPT Voice and Read Aloud features. To better understand the real-world applications of Voice Engine, OpenAI has been working with a select group of trusted partners since late 2022.



These collaborations have yielded interesting results, with companies like Age of Learning using Voice Engine for personalized educational content, HeyGen leveraging it for video translation, and Dimagi utilizing it to provide interactive feedback to community health workers. The technology has even been piloted in healthcare, with the Norman Prince Neurosciences Institute at Lifespan using it to restore the voices of patients with speech impairments.



However, OpenAI is well aware of the risks associated with generating speech that closely mimics people’s voices, particularly in an election year. To address these concerns, the company has implemented safety measures and usage policies for their partners, such as prohibiting impersonation without consent, requiring explicit permission from the original speaker, and using watermarking to trace the origin of generated audio.







            
            

            
            

            
            

        

As synthetic speech technology advances, OpenAI is advocating for proactive measures to ensure its responsible deployment. This includes phasing out voice-based authentication for sensitive information, educating the public on the capabilities and limitations of AI, and developing techniques to track the origin of audiovisual content.



In line with their commitment to AI safety, OpenAI has decided to preview Voice Engine but not release it widely at this time. By sharing these insights, the company aims to initiate a conversation about the future of synthetic voices and the necessary steps to harness their potential while mitigating the risks of misuse.



Here are a few reactions to OpenAI’s announcement:

Grayscale introduces crypto investment fund that prioritizes staking rewards

Grayscale Investments has announced an investment fund tailored for sophisticated clients eager to expose their portfolios to income generated from staking cryptocurrency tokens.According to a recent statement, the Grayscale Dynamic Income Fund (GDIC) is only available to clients holding more than $1.1 million assets under management (AUM), or with a net worth of more than $2.2 million.The fund intends to convert staking rewards into US dollars weekly, with distributions planned quarterly for investors. Additionally, Grayscale claims that careful analysis will be conducted to select the Proof of Stake (PoS) tokens included in the fund's portfolio. “Grayscale manages the complexity of staking and unstaking multiple tokens as each token has its own individual timelines and requirements to be staked and unstaked.”The main priority of the fund is to maximize staking income from the assets, with capital growth as a secondary focus, according to Grayscale.Crypto staking involves locking up crypto tokens to earn interest or rewards, which in turn ensures the secure and efficient operation of the blockchain network.Grayscale has named three PoS tokens that will be held in the fund, including Osmosis (OSMO) comprising a 24% portion, Solana (SOL) at 20%, and Polkadot (DOT) at 14%, while 43% is categorized under other tokens.OSMO currently offers a staking reward rate of 11.09%, SOL stands at 7.42%, and DOT is at 11.9%, according to data from Staking Rewards.However, only Solana (SOL) ranks among the top ten PoS tokens by market capitalization, as per CoinMarketCap data.The crypto holdings are subject to change at Grayscale's discretion. Source: GrayscaleMeanwhile, Grayscale's spot Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF), which launched on Jan. 11, has faced scrutiny due to its high fees, resulting in billions of outflows.On March 26, Cointelegraph reported that the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) has seen daily outflows since its launch totaling over $14 billion as of March 25.Related: Grayscale’s GBTC Bitcoin holdings have fallen 33% since its conversionGrayscale’s Bitcoin ETF charges a 1.5% per year management fee, five times that of the 0.30% average of the other spot Bitcoin ETFs.On the other hand, Grayscale continues to face regulatory hurdles in securing approval from the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) for its Ethereum Futures exchange-traded fund (ETF).Magazine: Bitcoin ETFs make Coinbase a ‘honeypot’ for hackers and governments: Trezor CEO

Prosecutors Seek Early Sale of FTX Founder's Luxury Jets to Prevent Losses Ahead of Sentencing



                    
In a recent development in the United States government’s legal battle against Sam “SBF” Bankman-Fried, former CEO of FTX, prosecutors have moved to liquidate two luxury aircraft before finalizing forfeiture procedures. 



The action, detailed in a filing on March 22 with the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York, stems from efforts led by U.S. Attorney Damian Williams to mitigate the financial losses on two planes associated with FTX and Bankman-Fried. 




The government’s strategy aims to address the depreciation of the assets in question, specifically a Bombardier Global and an Embraer Legacy, which were previously flagged in October 2023 as liable for seizure due to their connection with Bankman-Fried’s criminal activities.



The financial specifics regarding the aircraft, which were initially purchased for $15.9 million and $12.5 million respectively, remain somewhat ambiguous. 



Nevertheless, the prosecution plans to allocate up to $1.8 million for their maintenance and an additional $183,000 for the Embraer Legacy’s transfer, contingent upon the sales’ returns being adequate.




An agreement facilitated between the prosecutors, FTX, and its affiliates has paved the way for the Embraer Legacy to be relocated to a Florida airport, facilitating the U.S. Marshals Service (USMS) to initiate the sale process expediently.

The USMS had already taken control of the Bombardier Global earlier in February 2023, pursuant to a legal warrant.



These aircraft represent a fraction of the assets linked to Bankman-Fried that are earmarked for forfeiture following his conviction on multiple criminal charges. 



A list of assets disclosed in March included shares in Robinhood, various currencies, cryptocurrencies, and political donations made by SBF during his tenure at FTX. 



Neither Bankman-Fried nor his legal representative, Marc Mukasey, have contested the sale of the planes.



Bankman-Fried was found guilty of seven felony charges in November 2023 and is currently incarcerated, awaiting a sentencing hearing scheduled for March 28. 



The prosecution has proposed a sentence ranging from 40 to 50 years, while his defense has suggested a more lenient sentence of 6.5 years.

Bitcoin Offering ‘Final Bargain’ Opportunities Before Parabolic Rally Erupts, Says Trader - Here’s the Timeline - The Daily Hodl


								A closely followed analyst believes that Bitcoin (BTC) is now consolidating while gearing up for a parabolic move.
In a new video update on YouTube, pseudonymous analyst Rekt Capital tells his 70,600 subscribers that Bitcoin’s current value may not last for much longer as he expects the king crypto to soon soar to new all-time highs based on historical precedence.










“This re-accumulation range at these highs [around $70,000] is just noise, preparing us for the greater move. 
And it’s a matter of when rather than if, and it’s also a matter of time, because the more we can consolidate here, the more opportunity for bargain buying we have before we inevitably embark on that fantastic move towards the upside. So any pulling back, any consolidation around here, those are the final bargain buying opportunities before we enter that parabolic upside. 
Historically, that parabolic upside should occur after the halving and multiple weeks or even a couple of months after the halving.”
Source: Rekt Capital/YouTube
The trader also suggests that the parabolic upside that usually comes after Bitcoin’s halving events could happen sooner than usual this cycle due to the impact of spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs), which launched in January. Bitcoin already reached a new all-time high this cycle sooner than the historic price patterns.
“Once we break beyond these old all-time highs, we’re going to enter price discovery and that parabolic upside which would really just considerably shorten the pre-halving phase, the re-accumulation phase, and take us to new all-time highs into a parabolic rally, which has never been done before and that is understandable because we are seeing the ETFs play into the price action.” 
Bitcoin is trading for $69,983 at time of writing, down more than 1% in the last 24 hours.

Consensys Writes the SEC To Explain Ethereum’s Advanced Security


							

Consensys has asked the SEC to recognize the advanced safeguards inherent in Ethereum’s design.



The blockchain firm proposed in response to the SEC’s request for comments on ETH ETF.



According to Consensys, Ethereum’s PoS exceeds the security of Bitcoin’s PoW.




Consensys, a leading blockchain software technology company, has asked the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to recognize the advanced safeguards inherent in Ethereum’s design. The company proposed this in response to the SEC’s request for comments on the potential approval of Ethereum ETF applications.



In line with the applications, the SEC asked whether Ethereum’s Proof of Stake (PoS) raises “unique concerns” of fraud and manipulation that the agency should consider. Responding to the question, Consensys noted such concerns are wholly without merit.



The blockchain company published a letter explaining how Ethereum’s PoS implementation meets and exceeds the security of Bitcoin’s Proof of Work (PoW). According to Consensys, Bitcoin’s PoW ​​underlies Bitcoin-based ETFs that the SEC has already approved for trading.



In the comment letter, Consensys noted that the Ethereum PoS has strong built-in anti-fraud and anti-manipulation mechanisms. The company highlighted how this implementation surpasses Bitcoin’s PoW consensus model by being more resistant to tampering.



Some of Consensys’ highlights include Ethereum’s faster block finality and the blockchain’s distributed and randomized validation process that prevents pronounced stakeholder control. Consensys highlighted other Ethereum properties, like the total cost of attack, slashing penalties, and increased security alongside environmental benefits, as elements for Ethereum’s prevention mechanism against fraud and manipulation.









Furthermore, Consensys noted that the blockchain’s decentralized community and transparency enhance its security protection. The blockchain company emphasized the advanced safeguards inherent in Ethereum’s design. It cited that such safeguards will meet and exceed the exemplary security and resilience safeguards underlying Bitcoin-based ETPs already approved by the SEC.



Consensys publicized plans to onboard billions of users to web3. The blockchain firm is furthering this mission through public advocacy on the pending Ethereum ETF approval. Hence, the comment letter is a step towards driving progress and providing relevant information to the public.

Is the Last Decision in the Coinbase-SEC Case Positive for Cryptocurrencies? Famous Lawyer Evaluated - Bitcoin Sistemi

Regarding the latest development in the case between Coinbase and the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), Marisa Tashman Coppel, legal officer at Blockchain Association, shared her views on the court's decision.
Coppel called the court's rejection of the SEC's claim that Coinbase Wallet was functioning as an unregistered intermediary a “major victory for DeFi.” He criticized the SEC's overreach and called the decision beneficial for developers and those working on peer-to-peer technology.


Despite the victory, the court allowed the SEC's remaining claims to move forward. This means Coinbase will now make hard-fought discoveries and the facts will be considered in summary judgment. At this stage, the court is obliged to accept the facts claimed by the SEC as true.

As the case progresses, the court will grapple with the facts of decentralization, whether the “efforts of others” include the token holders themselves, and how to include token usage areas in the analysis, according to Coppel.





Coppel expressed concern about the court's adoption of the SEC's definition of “ecosystem” in the Howey analysis. The court stated that the tokens are investment contracts because buyers are purchasing the token's ecosystem, which depends on its value. Coppel argued that this reasoning could incorrectly classify many collectibles as securities.
The court's focus on how token projects initially launched their tokens was also notable. Coppel noted that additional facts will emerge during discovery that will undoubtedly support Coinbase's strong arguments.


Although the SEC has already tried to use the opinion as positive precedent in other cases, Coppel remains hopeful that courts will refuse to give the opinion too much weight because discovery has not yet been conducted.
Despite the challenges faced, Coppel remains optimistic. He praised the Coinbase team, led by Paul Grewal, for their strong arguments and expressed confidence in their ability going forward.





The US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) achieved great success in its lawsuit against Coinbase on Wednesday, and a judge ruled that the allegation that the cryptocurrency exchange sold unregistered securities could be heard by a jury at the hearing.

Post-SBF Crypto Evolution & AI's Role in Business: Insights from an Ex-FTX Investor | Cryptoglobe


                                
Arjun Sethi, the former CEO of Tribe Capital, appeared on CNBC’s “Closing Bell: Overtime” on March 28 to discuss the ramifications of Sam Bankman-Fried’s (SBF) trial and sentencing on the crypto industry. 



Arjun Sethi is a distinguished figure in the entrepreneurial and investment landscape, holding key positions as the Co-Founder, Chairman, and Chief Investment Officer of Tribe Capital, a venture capital firm founded in 2018 that oversees assets exceeding $1.6 billion and has invested in startups such as Carta, Relativity Space, Airtable, MoonPay, and Kraken. Tribe Capital stands out in the venture capital and cryptocurrency sectors for its innovative use of artificial intelligence and data science to maintain a competitive advantage. __



Before joining Tribe Capital, Sethi was integral to Social Capital as a Partner leading a venture team focused on early-stage investments in both consumer and enterprise domains. His investment successes at Social Capital feature companies like Front, Carta, Swarm (which was acquired by SpaceX), Slack, Cloud Kitchens, and Relativity Space. Sethi is celebrated in Silicon Valley as a top angel investor, with investments in prominent companies like Frax, Snapchat, Lyft, OpenDoor, and Gusto through various investment methods. 



His entrepreneurial journey includes founding and successfully exiting two companies; his venture, MessageMe, was acquired by Yahoo, leading to his significant role in Yahoo’s executive team, where he contributed to escalating mobile product usage. Additionally, Sethi founded and led LOLapps, a mobile gaming company that achieved 100M monthly users before its sale at $240M.



Sethi began by reflecting on the journey the crypto industry has undergone, especially in light of the FTX bankruptcy filing in November 2022. The sentencing of SBF not only marks the closure of a tumultuous chapter but also signifies a critical moment for the crypto industry’s evolution. According to Sethi, the industry has navigated through regulatory frameworks and the approval of spot Bitcoin ETFs in the U.S. and endured a crypto winter, emerging stronger on the other side. He emphasized the distinction between centralized and decentralized finance and exchanges, highlighting the resilience and accelerated pace of growth within the crypto sector.







            
            

            
            

            
            

        

FTX’s downfall was described by Sethi as a “blip in the radar,” acknowledging that bad actors exist across all industries. However, he stressed that the crypto industry has become increasingly resilient, with both retail and institutional investors worldwide contributing to its strength and momentum. The industry’s ability to move forward and grow stronger through adversity was a key point of discussion.



Beyond the immediate implications of the SBF sentencing, Sethi discussed his new venture, Termina, which has been spun out of Tribe Capital. Termina is a subscription-based AI software platform designed for quantitative diligence. Sethi outlined the importance of understanding the source of data and its utilization in the context of AI and generative AI technologies. He underscored that Termina represents not just his life’s work but also that of his team, leveraging one of the largest proprietary data sets of private companies globally, encompassing crypto, public markets, and private markets.



Addressing the potential for disillusionment with AI, Sethi drew parallels to the late 1990s tech boom and subsequent bust. He hinted at the cyclical nature of hype and disillusionment, suggesting that we might witness a similar phase with AI before realizing its full business potential. 



Sethi elaborated on the current enthusiasm surrounding AI, comparing the contemporary tech landscape to the dot-com era of the late 1990s. Unlike the speculative bubble that characterized the tech industry back then, where companies with minimal substance received massive investments based on hype, Sethi pointed out a key difference in today’s environment. Modern companies, particularly those in the AI domain, are not just ideas on a napkin but entities with real revenues, scaling at unprecedented rates.



He highlighted how traditional industries are adopting software, machine learning, and AI to become more efficient. This technological adoption, he argues, enables companies to do more with fewer resources, leading to significant cost reductions and enhanced customer experiences. Sethi shared an example of Klara, a company planning to go public, which has reportedly reduced customer service costs by 80% through AI integration.

Dogecoin: bets on DOGE reach $2 billion and the price of the crypto soars

Dogecoin is experiencing growth movements, with bets on DOGE skyrocketing to almost 2 billion dollars and the price of the crypto flying to $0.22, for the first time since 2021. 

Dogecoin: bets on DOGE increase and the price of the crypto soars to $0.22 
Strong enthusiasm in the Dogecoin house, which has seen betting on price volatility soar, with DOGE Futures Open Interest surpassing 2 billion dollars on March 29. 
At the time of writing, on Coinglass, the Open Interest is reported to be 2.14 billion dollars, up by +5.98%.
The price of the crypto also seems to reflect the general mood. On this Friday, March 29th, DOGE is worth $0.21, but yesterday it managed to exceed $0.22, a price it hadn’t seen since November 2021.
During the general crypto bull run, which saw Bitcoin (BTC) reach its new all-time high above $73,000, the price of DOGE had only risen to $0.18. Now, DOGE is up +72% in the last month and +35% in the last seven days. 
This Dogecoin result is reflected in the general sentiment which is “Extreme Greed”, (strong enthusiasm), as recorded by the Greed and Fear Index on DOGE. 

Dogecoin: bets on DOGE increase also thanks to speculation on crypto
Betting on DOGE and its increasing price are largely due to the speculation of using Dogecoin as a token on X, the social media giant owned by Elon Musk. 
In this regard, the Dogecoin developer @mishaboar would have published a tweet that better describes the issue: 

“Dear #Dogecoin, with the assignment to the new X payments branch of additional licenses in the United States, many are speculating on the implementation of cryptocurrency payments on the platform. Last year, Elon said that the first phase of X Payments would not include cryptocurrencies – I’m not sure if this has changed now. Earlier this month, Elon stated that X is very close to obtaining a money transfer license in California. It will still take a few months to obtain the license in New York.”
Basically, it seems that there is an association between Dogecoin and the payment license developments that any company of Elon Musk is obtaining, such as X or Tesla.  
Not only that, in mid-March, Musk himself had shaken the crypto world by hinting that DOGE could be used to purchase Tesla cars in the future.
The hypothesis of using DOGE on X
The mention of using DOGE on X had already been made in January 2024, when a potential integration of DOGE in XPayments was hypothesized.
XPayments is a peer-to-peer payment service of the social network that however would have never officially announced that DOGE is a payment option. 
Anyway, Musk, who took control of X in April 2023, has always been a supporter of Dogecoin.

The Cryptonomist

In this article we will see how to participate for free in the crypto airdrop of the Bitcoin blockchain restaking protocol.
The promising platform is currently in the testnet phase, waiting to complete the final improvements before reaching mainnet in the month of April.
For airdrop hunters, this is a tempting opportunity to farm an airdrop without having to spend money on fees.
Below are all the steps to be taken to qualify as eligible users.

How does the BounceBit protocol work
The next protocol that will distribute an airdrop to its early users is Bouncebit: we are talking about a project that is designing a restaking blockchain for Bitcoin capable of offering a yield to BTC holders through a mechanism that exploits the arbitrage of the funding rate on the crypto futures markets.
BounceBit is part of a layer-1 ecosystem based on the Proof of Stake (POS) consensus, covered by dual staking of BTC and BB (next BounceBit token subject to airdrop).
By doing so, the cryptographic infrastructure can leverage the security, liquidity, and relatively low volatility of Bitcoin, unlocking potential high-yield innovative solutions in the DeFi and CeFi field.
It is worth noting how the execution level of BounceBit allows to achieve the maximum compatibility with the EVM world facilitating the flow of liquidity between decentralized finance markets and the Bitcoin ecosystem.

In detail, the practice of restaking works as follows: users commit their inactive BTC to generate a reward from the arbitrage activity of funding rates on futures.
The locked BTC are then converted into BounceBTC, which offers a more streamlined and functional standard for the activities that will be carried out later.
The digital resource representing the BTC stake can now be delegated to one or more validators in exchange for stBTC, a liquid staking derivative.
This can in turn be restaked in shared security clients (SSC) to earn additional rewards.
Alternatively, users can directly stake BTC in SSC such as sidechains, bridges, and oracles or use them to participate in the so-called CeDeFi through AMM, leverage trading platforms, and yield farming protocols.

Given the ambitious goals and innovative technology brought to the field, BounceBit represents one of the most attention-grabbing next-generation protocols by private investors.
The company recently closed a $6 million financing round led by Blockchain Capital and Breyer Capital.
Other VC include dao5, CMS Holdings, Bankless Ventures, OKX Ventures and angel investors like Nathan from Anchorage Digital, Calvin and Jessy from Eigenlayer, Kevin and Ashwin from Brevan Howard and many others.
Considering the presence of individuals of utmost respect in this list and reflecting on the impact that this infrastructure could have on the concept of capital efficiency, we believe that BounceBit’s airdrop will be a real treasure for farmers.
The existence of such rewards has already been confirmed by the project team, which has organized an incentive campaign to encourage as many users as possible to test the restaking platform.
How to participate for free in the BounceBit crypto airdrop
With the launch of BounceBit’s mainnet scheduled for April, we only have a few days left to be able to farm for free (or almost) the airdrop of this protocol.
The first thing to do is to register on the platform through an invitation code, which you can easily find on the Discord channel of the project or on other social media.
Subsequently connect your wallet EVM, follow BounceBit on X and link your Discord account.
Then you can choose (it is advisable) whether to deposit assets in advance before the mainnet date within the BounceBit blockchain, starting from the Ethereum or BNB Chain networks.
You can deposit tokens such as WBTC, AUCTION, DAII, MUBI, USDT, BTCb, and FDUSD, and earn points that will be converted in the future. Please note that you will only be able to withdraw the same funds starting from May.
Just a 10 dollar deposit is enough to qualify for the airdrop.

Alternatively, if you do not want to spend a penny and farm the crypto airdrop completely for free, you can participate in the “BounceClub” initiative, aimed at bringing as many users as possible into the application, only available in the testnet network.
BounceClub is nothing more than a Web3 domain onchain that allows users to design, launch, and use decentralized applications (dApps) within the BTC ecosystem.
After entering the official website, click on the “sign in” option at the top right and connect your non-custodial wallet.
Automatically you will be asked to add the BounceBit test network: accept the request and sign the registration transaction.

At this point, if you have not made the $10 deposit in the previous section, you can only interact with the various clubs (new projects) by selecting the “clubs” section at the top left and following the various contents published by other users.
Instead if you have made the deposit as suggested, you are eligible to request the claim of the club creator role.
Scroll down on the same BounceBit testnet website and click on the “create a club” option as shown in the image.

Arrived here, you can create your club for free, significantly increasing the chances of receiving the crypto airdrop, by selecting an option between a “project club” and a “social club” (currently the testnet only supports project clubs)
Give a name to your project, create an accurate description, upload an avatar and you’re done!
Wait for the mainnet launch for further interactions that could increase the allocation of the airdrop.

Meanwhile, it could be a good idea to participate in the Galxe incentive campaign and get the highest score possible. Galxe often acts as a booster for larger airdrop allocations.

News on the impact of Bitcoin price from the April halving

Bitget, a well-known crypto exchange, has recently shared some news in a forecast regarding the price projections of Bitcoin for April, specifically concerning the famous halving event. 
Let’s see below all the details. 

Post-halving predictions: market news and Bitcoin price
As anticipated, Bitget has recently shared forecasts regarding the price of Bitcoin for the month of April, focusing on the significant event of the halving.
According to these predictions, the expected price range for BTC in April varies between $62,000 and $90,000. This range is mainly influenced by two main factors. 
First of all, the continuous inflation of funds through the BTC Spot ETF. After the approval of the BTC spot ETF by the SEC, Wall Street has shown a strong interest accumulating purchases for 200,000 BTC.
This buying spree has pushed the price of BTC to reach $73,000. It is expected that the BTC spot ETF will continue to be a significant source of fund inflow throughout April, which could further raise the price of BTC.
Another important aspect is the impact of the Bitcoin halving on the market. As we know, in April the quarterly event of the BTC market halving will occur.
After this event, daily BTC emissions will be reduced to 450, with an annual increase limited to only 160,000 units. This increase is equivalent to just one month of purchases for Wall Street. 
With continuous investments from Wall Street and the effects of the halving on the market, it is expected that the next bull market for BTC is coming soon. April therefore plays a crucial role in determining the trend of the months to come.
Bitcoin bullish trend: prospects towards new highs
As we know, Bitcoin reached a peak of $73,666 on March 13, but then encountered several complications along the way. The recovery was interrupted when the price slipped below the moving average, reaching a low of $60,870.
However, buyers’ enthusiasm has supported the market, pushing the price above the 21-day SMA and bringing Bitcoin back into the bullish zone, with the current valuation of about $70,319.
Some analysts predict that the current bullish trend will continue until reaching the previous high of $73,666. If buyers manage to overcome this resistance, Bitcoin could target the psychological level of $80,000.
The current bullish momentum has been evident with the crossing of the 21-day SMA for two consecutive times. However, the price movement has been slowed down by the formation of doji candles.
Bitcoin is approaching its all-time high, but its ability to surpass it remains uncertain. Breaking through this threshold could mean a further increase in value, while failure could lead to a sideways phase in the market. 
In any case, Bitcoin should remain above the moving average to maintain the bullish trend, even though it could be traded below the resistance of $73,000.
Bitcoin ETF Perspectives
The chief investment officer of Bitwise, Matt Hougan, recently expressed confidence in the future of spot Bitcoin (BTC) exchange-traded funds (ETFs), predicting a steady flow of investments in the coming years.
Hougan, followed by over 40,700 users on X, argues that there is a large pool of customers who, although not yet invested in BTC ETFs, will likely be in the future.
According to Hougan, the trend of inflows into Bitcoin ETFs will continue over time. Adoption varies significantly among professional investors, with some already invested while others still need to consider the option. 
However, Hougan believes that over 100 processes of due diligence in the next two years will change the landscape.
Contrary to gold ETFs, Hougan predicts a faster adoption ramp for Bitcoin ETFs, although he emphasizes that it will still take years to achieve full adoption.
Hougan suggests that Bitcoin ETFs will help increase trust in the digital asset, prompting investors to increase their allocation of BTC in their portfolios. 
According to him, the standard allocation of 3% surpasses the old standard of 1%, as ETFs reduce the risk of significant losses, paving the way for a higher and safer allocation towards Bitcoin.

Microsoft Copilot Blocked on US Congress Devices Over Security Concerns | Cryptopolitan

Axios notes that Microsoft Copilot AI chatbot has been formally barred from use on devices owned by members of the US Congress, which is a recent development regarding the junction of technology and government. House Chief Administrative Officer Catherine Szpindor’s memo announcing this decision highlights the growing worries regarding the cybersecurity vulnerabilities posed by powerful artificial intelligence systems. Securing sensitive government data from possible leaks to unapproved platforms is made possible in large part by this limitation, which is based on the Office of Cybersecurity’s evaluation.The ban on Microsoft CopilotUS Congressional employees are navigating a new tech environment without Microsoft’s Copilot AI chatbot in response to new security dangers. The decision is clearly prohibited from being used with any government-issued Windows device when using Copilot, as stated in a message from House Chief Administrative Officer Catherine Szpindor. The Office of Cybersecurity’s concerns—which include the impending potential of data leaking to non-House approved cloud services—are the driving force behind this exhaustive precaution. People can still use their personal devices to access Copilot, but the restriction highlights how important it is to safeguard private information held by the House from illegal access.It is reminiscent of earlier limitations placed on comparable AI-powered instruments in government environments, even as the Capitol struggles with the implications of this prohibition. Utilizing OpenAI’s extensive language models, ChatGPT is an AI chatbot similar to Copilot. Congress placed strict restrictions on its use about a year ago. Although House PCs could not run the free version of ChatGPT, its premium version (ChatGPT Plus) was nonetheless allowed for some uses because of its improved privacy settings. This tiered approach to AI governance highlights the fine line that must be drawn between utilizing cutting-edge technologies for governmental purposes and reducing related security threats.Microsoft’s response and future outlookMicrosoft acknowledged to Axios that government users have higher security requirements. A new version of Microsoft 365’s Copilot assistant and an Azure OpenAI service for classified workloads were among the products and services included in the roadmap that was unveiled last year for government use. According to the corporation, all of those services and tools would have enhanced security levels, making them better suited for managing sensitive data. Axios reports that Szpindor’s office will assess the government version of Copilot when it becomes ready before determining whether or not it may be utilized on House devices.The decision to turn off Microsoft Copilot on devices controlled by Congress serves as a sobering reminder of the intricate interplay that exists between cybersecurity regulations and technological innovation, particularly in light of the ongoing debate about AI governance. The prohibition raises important concerns about the future course of AI integration inside legal frameworks, even while it is a proactive approach to safeguarding confidential government data. In an increasingly AI-driven society, how can regulators strike a careful balance between protecting against potential security flaws and promoting innovation? The search for sensible AI regulation is still an ongoing project with significant ramifications for both national security and technical progress as Congress negotiates these intricate relationships.

EU Parliament Votes to Ban Anonymous Crypto Transactions, Sparking Debate Over Privacy



                    
The European Parliament’s leading committees have recently greenlit a legislation that targets anonymous cryptocurrency transactions through hosted wallets, aligning with efforts to extend the European Union’s Anti-Money Laundering (AML) and Counter-Terrorist Financing directives to the digital currency sector. 



This development occurs in the wake of a provisional agreement between the European Council and Parliament to incorporate the cryptocurrency market within the scope of the EU’s stringent AML laws.




Patrick Breyer, representing the Piratenpartei Deutschland (Pirate Party of Germany) in the European Parliament, shared via an X post that this legislative update received approval from the majority of the Parliament’s primary committees on March 19. 



Breyer, alongside Gunnar Beck of the Alternative für Deutschland (Alternative for Germany), stood out by voting against the prohibition of unidentified crypto transactions. 



The legislation is particularly directed at custodial crypto wallets provided by third parties, including centralized exchange platforms.




The revised AML regulations will also enforce restrictions on anonymous cash and cryptocurrency transactions.

Transactions exceeding 3,000 euros in cash will be banned for commercial dealings, and all cash transactions over 10,000 euros will be prohibited in business contexts.



Predictions from Dillon Eustace, a law firm based in Ireland, suggest that the legislation could be implemented ahead of its expected three-year timeline from the date it becomes effective. 



Cryptocurrency networks, known for their permissionless and anonymous access, face significant changes under this new framework.



Following the committee’s endorsement of the bill, Breyer expressed his concerns in a press statement, highlighting the threats to economic autonomy and financial privacy the legislation poses. 



He emphasized the right to anonymous transactions as a core value.



The crypto sector’s reaction to these regulatory measures is divided. 



While some view the updated AML laws as a necessary step, others worry about potential privacy infringements and limitations on economic freedom.



Daniel “Loddi” Tröster, host of the Sound Money Bitcoin Podcast, pointed out the practical difficulties and broader consequences of the legislation. 



He noted its impact on donations and the general use of cryptocurrency within the EU, raising alarms about the possible restrictive effects on the digital currency landscape.

Bitfinex Reports an Unusual Glitch; Halts and Resumes Trading


							

Bitfinex discloses an issue related to the platform’s reduced performance.



Soon, the platform successfully completed maintenance and resumed trading.



Bitfinex returned to the view-only mode at 2.40 AM UTC before recommencing trading at 2.45 AM UTC.




Bitfinex, an iFinex-owed crypto exchange, has recently disclosed the platform’s “reduced performances” and announced a temporary suspension of trading. In a recent X post, Bitfinex updated that the platform would resume trading at 2:45 AM UTC after the successful completion of maintenance.







In the preceding post, Bitfinex invited the community’s attention to the ongoing investigation regarding the platform’s performance issues. The exchange appreciated the users’ patience and assured them they would provide updates on the subsequent developments.







According to the latest update, the platform has resumed trading in view-only mode at 2:40 AM UTC. Later, at 2:45 AM UTC, Bitfinex recommenced trading, confronting the identified issues. The post read,




Our maintenance is nearing a successful completion and the Bitfinex platform will be returning in view-only mode with the option to cancel orders at 2:40 AM UTC, before trading opens at 2:45 AM UTC. Thank you for your patience.




The community remained cautious of the matter, with many responding to Bitfinex’s alert with anxiety. However, the crypto research platform Cryptoiz Research assured the community of Bitfinex’s imminent recovery, stating, “Bitfinex maintenance almost done!”









As Bitfinex, one of the largest Bitcoin trading platforms, rarely encounters technical glitches, the performance issue in question could be seen as an unusual incident. However, unlike glitches, multiple hacks and exploits can be identified in Bitfinex’s history.



One of the biggest exploits reported in Bitfinex was the 2016 hack executed by Heather Morgan and her husband, Lichtenstein. The couple reportedly stole more than 120,000 BTC worth $3.6 billion at the time.

💎 Hidden Gems: These Altcoins Could Lead to 1000% Profits! | Cryptopolitan

After the Bitcoin halving event, a huge jump in crypto prices is expected, with Bitcoin potentially soaring up to $250,000. In the wake of such a major bull run, attention is now turning to lesser-known cryptocurrencies. These hidden gems in the altcoin market might not only catch the wave but could also deliver staggering returns, possibly exceeding 1000% in profits. Discover which altcoins have the potential to outshine in the rapidly evolving crypto landscape.BlastUP Goes Viral, Raising $3 Million in Just One MonthBlastUP, the premier launchpad on Blast, has recently made waves in the crypto world with its stunning debut, raising $3 million in just one month. Many smart investors are rushing to buy BlastUP tokens before their value skyrockets.Holders of BlastUP tokens may benefit from a number of privileges including  participation in an Airdrop, exclusive loyalty rewards for participating in IDOs, and the ability to earn interest through staking.BlastUP stands out from the crowd in the crypto world. Backed by Blast, the sixth largest blockchain by TVL, it offers genuine utility as a launchpad for DApp ventures. With its motto Grow faster, earn more, BlastUP is dedicated to propelling the success of blockchain startups. Those who join BlastUP now become part of a project poised to become the next big thing in this bull run.>> Buy BlastUP tokens before they skyrocket <<Jupiter Surpasses Resistances, Signaling GrowthJupiter’s current market position at $1.25 shows it bypassing the nearest resistance level of $0.68 and the second resistance at $0.81, suggesting a strong upward trend. Investors may see this as a sign of continued growth. However, with the 10-day Simple Moving Average at $1 and a “Sell” recommendation, short-term profit-taking could cause a reversion to nearer support at $0.42 or even to the second support level at $0.30. The price might fluctuate, but the current dynamics indicate room for cautious optimism.Long-term expectations for Jupiter might be bright considering its current performance above the usual resistance levels. The absence of the 100-day Simple Moving Average figures makes it challenging to confirm a long-term trend, but if the current price sustains above the $1 mark, confidence could lead to further investment and possible stabilization above the most recent support levels. The room for growth exists, but without overlooking that a shift in sentiment or market dynamics could bring prices closer to support levels. Investors should stay updated on Jupiter’s progress to make informed decisions.NEAR Protocol’s Price Movement and Market OutlookNEAR Protocol shows a current price of $7.02, which is slightly above the 10-day moving average of $7.00, signaling a potential consolidation in the near term. However, the fact that the current price is significantly higher than the 100-day moving average of $4.25 suggests strong recent momentum. Looking at the resistance levels, $4.49 and $5.11 might act as stepping stones for further upward movements if the positive trend continues. Yet, it’s crucial to keep in mind that prices can fluctuate, and hitting these resistance levels could also lead to a price correction.Considering the current support levels at $2.97 and $2.07, there’s room for downside if the market faces negative pressure. Investors should be aware that a dip below the nearest support level could trigger further declines, testing the second support level. Nonetheless, NEAR Protocol’s ability to maintain itself above these support levels in the long run could attract more investment, potentially leading to a steady increase in value. The contrast between short-term corrections and long-term gains defines the volatile nature of cryptocurrency markets, and NEAR is no exception.Ondo’s Price Above SMA, Targets $0.66 MarkOndo’s current price stands strong at $0.89, which is above both the 10-day simple moving average of $0.82 and the nearest resistance level of $0.55. If the momentum carries on, the next target for bulls could be the $0.66 mark. This upward potential is bolstered by the current trend, which could see an influx of buyers aiming to capitalize on sustained growth. Short-term gains might attract traders, possibly driving the price up further.However, we must keep an eye on the support levels at $0.26 and $0.08, which are significant in case the market shifts. Should the price face downward pressure, it might test these support zones. Long-term prospects may turn cautious if the price were to break below the 10-day SMA, leading to an adjustment phase where the price seeks new support. The current price positioning suggests a delicate balance that could tip in either direction with market sentiment changes.ConclusionWhile Jupiter, NEAR Protocol, and Ondo exhibit encouraging signs of advancement and potential for investors, BlastUp stands out in this constellation of altcoins. Detailing its trajectory in the broader “Blast” ecosystem, BlastUp demonstrates not only remarkable growth but an innovative concept that resonates with crypto enthusiasts. What sets BlastUp apart is the robustness of the ecosystem it’s a part of, which adds to its endurance and appeal. As each project possesses its unique strengths, BlastUp is positioned with the highest potential for explosive returns—highlighting a compelling opportunity for investors in the search for the next big breakout in the cryptocurrency market.Site: https://blastup.io/Twitter: https://twitter.com/Blastup_ioDiscord: https://discord.gg/5Kc3nDhqVWTelegram: https://t.me/blastup_io

Smart Money Crypto Investments For April | Cryptopolitan

Bitcoin’s value could jump really high after the halving event where miners get fewer bitcoins for their work. Some people think Bitocin could go up to $250,000! This shows how crypto can really change in value. With such big moves, it’s smart to know where to put money in crypto. Our article talks about smart crypto investments for April, helping to understand this exciting time.BlastUP Goes Viral, Raising $3 Million in Just One MonthBlastUP, the premier launchpad on Blast, has recently made waves in the crypto world with its stunning debut, raising $3 million in just one month. Many smart investors are rushing to buy BlastUP tokens before their value skyrockets.Holders of BlastUP tokens may benefit from a number of privileges including  participation in an Airdrop, exclusive loyalty rewards for participating in IDOs, and the ability to earn interest through staking.BlastUP stands out from the crowd in the crypto world.

With its motto Grow faster, earn more, BlastUP is dedicated to propelling the success of blockchain startups. Those who join BlastUP now become part of a project poised to become the next big thing in this bull run.>> Buy BlastUP tokens before they skyrocket <<Solana Price Analysis: Strengths and Potential RisksSolana’s current price shows strength at $184.65, which might encourage buying. Short-term, if it stays above the 10-day average of $184.32, it could test the nearest resistance level at $192.72. However, a drop below could see it touch support around $100.87, which could be a solid entry point. In the long term, if positive trends continue, we might see it break past $199.73, hinting at further growth.On the flip side, investors should tread carefully. If Solana fails to maintain current levels and falls below the 100-day average of $120.11, it could signify weakness. This could lead to a test of the second support level at $76.03. Long-term viability depends on market reception and technological adaptation, so if sentiment sours, Solana may struggle. However, at present levels, it seems to have a bullish outlook, balancing optimism with a cautious approach.Avalanche: Struggling at $53.35 Amid Mixed SignalsAvalanche is showing a tight grip around the $53.35 mark, testing waters above the $51.66 resistance level. The near-term landscape suggests a tug-of-war between gains and retracements. Support at $33.98 needs to hold to prevent dips toward the $26.97 area, which could be bargain zones for long-term investors. Market signals are mixed; the 100-day average hints at a growing momentum, while shorter-term indicators suggest caution as the asset navigates current levels.Despite a robust standing today, Avalanche’s path reflects both vigor and volatility, with an eye on surpassing the $54.91 average soon. Investor sentiments could push for a test of the $46.32 resistance, perhaps climbing further if the trend catches fire. However, reliance on clear signals is crucial—observing both the MACD’s sell suggestion and the long-term buy signal from the 100-day average provides a balanced strategy moving forward. For those playing the long game, stability and gradual uptrends offer potential, while short-term traders watch for pivots around key support and resistance levels.Polkadot Trading Analysis: Potential for GrowthPolkadot is currently at $9.41, sandwiched between the immediate resistance at $9.26 and the next hurdle at $10.25. Given that the simple moving averages for both 10 and 100 days suggest ‘Buy’ at $9.37 and $8.21 respectively, investors could anticipate upward momentum if these levels hold as support. With the nearest support at $6.91, and the following one at $5.55, there’s room for growth as long as these levels aren’t breached. However, mixed signals from RSI, MACD, and Stochastic RSI indicating ‘Neutral’ and ‘Sell’ hint at potential short-term volatility.Looking ahead, Polkadot may see some long-term opportunities: surpassing $10.25 could set the tone for a bullish trend. Notably, the 100-day SMA below the current price may act as a steady floor, suggesting a solid foundation has been built. Nonetheless, investors must remain wary as the current indicators provide reasons for caution. The recommendation of ‘Sell’ by MACD should not be taken lightly, and any drop below $6.91 could lead to a test of the second support at $5.55, complicating the recovery path.  XRP Eyes $0.70 Amid Balanced MomentumXRP’s current price of $0.62 could push towards the nearest resistance at $0.64, eyeing the second resistance at $0.70 as optimism grows. Given that the 10-day moving average aligns with the current price, it suggests a balanced momentum. Short-term trading could see profit around these levels, especially if buying pressure continues and pushes beyond the immediate resistance, leveraging the positive sentiment.However, we must be cautious of the nearest support at $0.51 and second support at $0.43. A turn in sentiment could have XRP testing these lower bounds. Over the long term, the 100-day moving average at $0.58 suggests that the current price has outpaced the average market trend, implying potential for a correction if the broader context turns bearish.  ConclusionIn conclusion, April’s crypto investment landscape offers an array of options, from the established prowess of Bitcoin to the promising paths charted by Solana, Avalanche, Polkadot, and XRP. These coins present opportunities with varying degrees of potential, yet each carries an element of risk amidst the anticipation for growth. Topping this month’s watchlist, however, is BlastUp, which not only embodies an enticing concept but also benefits from its synergies within the broader Blast ecosystem. Its vibrant potential shines as a standout, hinting at a future where smart money might indeed see explosive returns.Site: https://blastup.io/Twitter: https://twitter.com/Blastup_ioDiscord: https://discord.gg/5Kc3nDhqVWTelegram: https://t.me/blastup_io

5 Crypto Coins You Must Buy Before Bitcoin Explodes to $150k | Cryptopolitan

With the Bitcoin halving event on the horizon, forecasts are swirling around the possibility of Bitcoin reaching a staggering $150,000. The crypto community is perched on the edge of anticipation, watching for the start of a monumental bull run. In the midst of this excitement, several cryptocurrencies are emerging as likely beneficiaries of Bitcoin’s predicted rally. These standout coins, expected to thrive alongside Bitcoin’s surge, are drawing keen interest as the market anticipates heating up.BlastUP Goes Viral, Raising $3 Million in Just One MonthBlastUP, the premier launchpad on Blast, has recently made waves in the crypto world with its stunning debut, raising $3 million in just one month.

Those who join BlastUP now become part of a project poised to become the next big thing in this bull run.>> Buy BlastUP tokens before they skyrocket <<Render Stock Nears SMA, Poised for Growth or DropRender’s current price at $10.94 shows it’s edging above the 10-day simple moving average of $11.02. If this momentum continues, surpassing the nearest resistance at $9.12 should be no challenge, followed by aiming for the second resistance at $10.72. Given this trend, a steady climb in value is feasible, potentially reaching higher levels if the demand persists.However, considering the volatility, there’s a possibility for a downturn towards the nearest support level at $5.09, and in a less favorable scenario, even the second support level at $2.66. Long-term growth bets should take into account the 100-day simple moving average at $6.47, which may indicate where the price could stabilize after fluctuations. It’s crucial to prepare for shifts in both directions.Jupiter’s Market Outlook: Growth Amid VolatilityJupiter’s current market position indicates a potential upward trajectory with a price of $1.25, signaling investor confidence. Support levels at $0.42 and $0.30 provide a cushion against market volatility. If bullish momentum persists and Jupiter clears the resistance at $0.68, and then $0.81, a steady climb could be realized. This ascent could be supported by positive technical indicators like the 10-day Simple Moving Average at $1.28, suggesting that some investors view the current price as an entry point for growth.However, market indicators like MACD suggest selling, and a neutral stance from both RSI and Stochastic RSI Fast indicates uncertainty. Should Jupiter’s price fall below its current support, it risks bearish momentum. In the short term, this could lead to a downturn toward the second support level. Despite the potential short-term decline, the current trading price above both support levels may provide a favorable long-term outlook if broader market sentiment remains optimistic.NEAR Protocol Price Analysis: Stability and GrowthNEAR Protocol’s current price holds at $7.01, just above the 10-day average, suggesting a stable short-term trend. Prices at such a juncture indicate a movement above the near and second resistance levels of $4.49 and $5.11, respectively. The indicators like the MACD point to a selling signal, but this contrast with the 10-days and 100-days Simple Moving Average buying suggestions could signify a pullback before further upward trends. The key support levels to watch are $2.97 and $2.07, as they could serve as a potential bounce-back zones if the price were to decrease. The mixed signals from different indicators present a complex short-term scenario, but a continuous hold above the 100-day average could set the tone for an overall positive momentum.Looking at the longer view, NEAR’s solid position above the $4.25 Simple Moving Average for 100 days is a good sign of strength. As indicators give buy signals at this longer average, it reflects confidence in its lasting potential. However, investors should be cautious; the RSI’s neutral stance mixed with the MACD’s selling recommendation suggests that while growth is probable, there might be fluctuations along the way. If the current price can be maintained or grows beyond the recent high, it would boost confidence among holders and possibly attract new investment. The balance between seizing opportunities at moments of price drops and keeping watch for longer-term growth is essential. The interplay between short-term volatility and ongoing stability is a critical focal point for NEAR’s future prospects.Avalanche Price Analysis: Mixed Market SignalsAvalanche is currently at $53.56, pushing above the simple moving average of the last 10 days, which is at $54.92, but facing a headwind to reach the next resistance at $51.66. Long-term, the 100-day moving average sitting at $41.43 supports a healthier trend, but given mixed signals like ‘Neutral’ RSI and ‘Sell’ from both MACD and the 10-day SMA, cautious optimism is advised. Investors should watch for the asset to either secure its ground above $53.56 or retract and test support levels at $33.98 or further down at $26.97, which could provide buy opportunities.Despite the short-term sell signals, Avalanche holds above the crucial support level of $33.98, providing a cushion. If the current price of $53.56 stabilizes, it may set a base for upward movement towards the second resistance of $51.66, already surpassed. However, vigilance is key as moving averages are split between ‘Buy’ at the 100-day mark and ‘Sell’ at the shorter 10-day timeframe, signifying potential turbulence ahead. In the event of a pullback, the floor at $26.97 might serve as a defensive point, yet also a zone for entry, anticipating a recovery in the medium to long term.ConclusionIn conclusion, while the digital currency arena presents a variety of opportunities, BlastUp seems poised for the highest potential within the thriving “Blast” ecosystem. Though Render, Jupiter, NEAR Protocol, and Avalanche each have their merits and possibilities for gains—especially with Bitcoin’s expected rally—their outlooks carry a tone of cautious optimism due to mixed market signals. Investors may find promise in these altcoins but should keep a keen eye on BlastUp, whose compelling concept anchors it as a standout choice for those looking to capitalize on the forthcoming crypto wave.Site: https://blastup.io/Twitter: https://twitter.com/Blastup_ioDiscord: https://discord.gg/5Kc3nDhqVWTelegram: https://t.me/blastup_io

Is Shiba Inu (SHIB) Posed for a 16% Rally?


Shiba Inu (SHIB) witnessed a good start to the month of March as it charted new 2024 highs, but this did not last long.
Following corrections and recovery, the meme coin is now at a crucial price, which will likely rally for this reason.
Shiba Inu Whales Don’t Quit
Shiba Inu’s price corrected by over 30% at the beginning of the month, but this did not discourage the large wallet holders who kept on adding SHIB to their wallets. In the span of a month, over 11 trillion SHIB were accumulated by these whales, who increased their holdings by $337 million.

Since Shiba Inu is primarily a whale-focused token, these investors tend to have a lot of influence over price action.

Additionally, the meme coin also observes conviction at the hands of its retail investors. Active addresses by profitability highlight whether the investors that are participating on the network are in, at, or out of the money.

At the moment, more than 80% of the active addresses are dominated by investors who are awaiting profits or losses. Investors in profit make up only 18% of the participation, which suggests that selling is not on the cards of SHIB holders right now.

This would substantiate further increases in the meme coin’s price.
SHIB Price Prediction: Bullish Signals Take the Front Stage
After recovering by more than 28%, Shiba Inu’s price reclaimed the support of $0.00003000. Based on the aforementioned factors, it is expected to bounce off this support and rally.
The Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD), a trend-following momentum indicator used to identify bullish and bearish trends, is also at the cusp of signaling a bullish crossover.
This would signal that SHIB is poised to climb the charts and tag the year-to-date highs of $0.00003599. Breaching this would establish new 2024 highs for SHIB.

However, if the support of $0.00003000 is lost, the meme coin will potentially fall to $0.00002855. Losing this would invalidate the bullish thesis and send the price below $0.00002500.

50% of MATIC holders are facing losses - What now? - AMBCrypto



Less than 45% of holders were in profit.
MATIC’s price might climb to $1.30 as the Napoli upgrade approaches.

Polygon [MATIC] erasing a large part of its recent gains has caused holders nothing but pain, data from IntoTheBlock showed. According to the crypto analytics platform, 50% of MATIC holders were at a loss.
On the other hand, 44% were in profit while the remaining 6% had broken even. This data comes as a surprise considering how the token performed at one point.
Source: IntoTheBlock
Few weeks back AMBCrypto reported how Polygon’s token climbed and showed potential of hitting $2. However, the last few days have not been great for the cryptocurrency.
As of this writing, CoinMarketCap revealed that the price of MATIC had decreased by 4.44% in the last seven days. Specifically, MATIC’s value was $0.99, indicating that bulls found it difficult to revisit the $1 psychological resistance.
However, this decline does not mean that MATIC was out of the race for tokens that would perform well this season. But recovery might be important for short-term holders.
Polygon wants MATIC to cook
So, does Polygon have any significant upgrade that could fuel a “buy the rumor” hike? Well, AMBCrypto found that there might be one.
On the 27th of March, the project revealed that a new upgrade was in the works called the “Napoli upgrade.” According to the blog post, the upgrade would help Polygon achieve network consensus.
It added that this would be done via the integration of improvements to the parallel execution, and new operational codes for the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM).
As a result of the Napoli upgrade, Mumbai, which is a Testnet of the Proof-of-Stake (PoS) network, would be phased out in April. In turn, the Amoy Testnet would take its place.
Like previous upgrades, this upcoming development could be bullish for MATIC. Should buying pressure increase going forward, then MATIC’s price might rise toward $1.30.
Some difficulties arise
Despite the bullish potential MATIC has, Polygon still has some challenges. One of them was with its Total Value Locked (TVL).
In 2021, Polygon’s TVL had an incredible run that saw it get close to $10 billion. But press time data from DeFiLlama showed that the metric was a mere $1.07 billion.
Source: DeFiLlama
TVL measures the value of assets locked or staked in a protocol. If it increases, it means that market participants have added liquidity to the protocol while helping to improve its health.

Realistic or not, here’s MATIC’s market cap in ETH terms

The opposite happens when the metric decreases. In the last 30 days, deposits to protocol under Polygon have increased by 3.66%. However, the increase was small compared to other chains.
But it is not all the time that this metric influences price. As such the value of MATIC might jump irrespective of the condition of the network’s health.

Shiba Inu Whales Make Big Moves, Is It Time To Buy?


								Shiba Inu (SHIB) whales are at it again, with large transactions involving the meme coin recorded lately. These high-volume transactions have piqued the interest of other investors, who have deliberated on whether this could be the perfect opportunity to accumulate the meme coin. 
Shiba Inu Whale Transfers 2 Trillion SHIB Tokens 
On-chain analytics platform Whale Alert revealed in an X (formerly Twitter) post that 2 trillion SHIB were transferred from a Kucoin-linked wallet (Kucoin 6) to another Kucoin-linked wallet (Kucoin 20). Interestingly, this came amidst the charges leveled against the exchange and its founders. 

On-chain data further revealed that the receiving wallet began to transfer these SHIB tokens across different wallets. While the nature of the transactions remains unknown, the troubled crypto exchange may have made these transfers to meet customers’ demands. 
If so, that signifies a bullish sentiment among SHIB whales, who still want to purchase as much of the meme coin as possible. For instance, the Kucoin 20 wallet, which received the 2 trillion SHIB tokens, transferred over 35 million SHIB to an unknown wallet, and that wallet hasn’t moved the SHIB tokens since then, which suggests they could be long-term holders. 

Bitcoin is now trading at $70.012. Chart: TradingView
Another wallet that also received 4.7 million SHIB tokens from the Kucoin 20 wallet moved its holdings to a warm wallet, possibly due to Kucoin FUD, and in a bid to preserve its holdings. The moves made by these wallets underline the bullish outlook for the SHIB token, with large-scale investors having no intention of disposing of their tokens anytime soon. 
Meanwhile, it is worth mentioning that the Kucoin 20 wallet transferred 1.4 trillion SHIB tokens back to the Kucoin 6 wallet. Those tokens are still in the wallet and haven’t been moved since then. 
Time To Buy Shiba Inu?
Crypto trader and analyst Xanrox had previously advised investors to load their SHIB bags at the $0.0000212995 price level. However, with SHIB trading far above that level, there is the feeling that it may never return to that entry point, especially with crypto expert Rekt Capital recently stating that the meme coin has built support at the $0.000026041 price level.

Although Xanrox’s entry point may have been missed, investing in SHIB right now still looks like a good move based on the predictions of different analysts. This includes Xanrox, who hinted that SHIB could rise to a new all-time high (ATH) by July. Meanwhile, analysts like Oscar Ramos have predicted that SHIB could shed another zero on the road to $0.0001. 
At the time of writing, SHIB was trading at around $0.00003029, down over 2% in the last 24 hours, according to data from CoinMarketCap.

Multicoin Capital's Crypto Hedge Fund Posts Staggering 9,281% Growth Since 2017

                        Crypto-focused hedge fund Multicoin Capital has delivered extraordinary returns to its investors, exceeding 9,000% since its launch in 2017. In its annual investor letter, the fund revealed that after experiencing significant losses in 2022 that nearly wiped out its value, Multicoin Capital’s fortunes have dramatically turned around.According to the investor letter, dated February 16, the Multicoin Capital Master Fund has recorded a staggering return of 9,281% since its inception on October 1, 2017. Multicoin Capital’s Gains Surge Amid Market Rebound
The performance is primarily attributed to the resurgence of the cryptocurrency market, with the fund generating a remarkable 537% return in 2023 alone. The firm is anticipated to file a Form ADV, a regulatory requirement for advisers registering with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and exempt reporting advisors. According to the firm’s previous Form ADV, it reported over $1.36 billion in assets under regulatory management.Multicoin Capital’s executives, Tushar Jain, Kyle Samani, and Matt Shapiro, also mentioned the crypto market’s behavior in the investor letter. They highlighted that in 2023, cryptocurrencies defied expectations and rebounded in spectacular fashion, enabling the hedge fund to capitalize on the market’s overreaction and achieve significant outperformance.The impressive returns achieved by Multicoin Capital have more than compensated for the fund’s substantial 91.4% loss in 2022. The investor letter clarifies that the performance figures since the fund’s inception include various investments made through side pockets, which contributed to the overall outcome.Despite enduring a painful bear market cycle, Multicoin Capital’s executives view that period as ultimately inconsequential for the investment firm. They acknowledged the challenges posed by macro tightening, a directed political vendetta, and the fallout from a significant financial fraud, alluding to the collapse of embattled crypto exchange FTX, to which their firm was exposed.Crypto Funds See a Surge in Assets
Earlier this year, Balance, a digital asset custodian based in Canada, has revealed that it has once again achieved $2 billion in assets under custody (AUC) amid the recent recovery in crypto markets. Likewise, Korea Digital Asset (KODA), the largest institutional crypto custody service in South Korea, has seen a remarkable growth in crypto assets under its custody. Just recently, the company revealed that the value of these crypto assets under its custody expanded by nearly 248% in the second half of 2023.KODA, which was established through a collaboration between major Korean bank KB Bank, crypto venture capital firm Hashed, and blockchain tech firm Haechi Labs, said that the value of these assets reached approximately 8 trillion Korean won ($6 billion) by the end of last year. This was a substantial increase from the 2.3 trillion won recorded at the end of June 2023.According to analysts at Bernstein Research, crypto funds could reach a staggering $500 billion to $650 billion within the next five years, a significant leap from the current valuation of approximately $50 billion.

Billionaire Michael Novogratz Regrets Not Jumping on WIF


							

Billionaire Michael Novogratz regrets not holding meme coin Dogwifhat (WIF).



Novogratz disclosed that he feared regulatory scrutiny for involving in the Solana meme coin.



The commentary comes amid WIF soaring by 2,552% to a new ATH of $4.47.




American billionaire crypto investor Michael Novogratz has wittily expressed regrets for not holding the fastest-growing Solana meme coin, Dogwifhat (WIF). Novogratz made the remark at a recent conference in Manhattan as captured in a recent report by Bloomberg.



The conference was about Bitcoin’s surge into mainstream investing. However, during the summit, attendees were captivated not by the behemoth cryptocurrency but by the newcomer WIF, distinguished by its logo of a dog donning a cozy knit hat.









Amid discussions led by industry luminaries and top executives from financial giants like BlackRock, Novogratz, the CEO of Galaxy Digital, playfully expressed remorse over his lack of involvement with Dogwifhat.



“I don’t, as much as I want to,” Novogratz joked, drawing laughter from the audience. Interestingly, the billionaire Bitcoin investor disclosed that he feared scrutiny from the U.S. regulator should he disclose an involvement with the Solana meme coin. In his words:




I just fear if I tweet ‘God, I love Dogwifhat like Arthur Hayes does,’ I will literally be investigated two days later by the CFTC.




Notably, this commentary from Novogratz comes amid Dogwifhat’s shocking price performance within the last three months. WIF has soared by a staggering 2,552% gain from a low of $0.07846 in late last December to new all-time highs of $4.47 today.



Following this explosive surge, the Solana meme coin has become the third most prominent digital asset in the meme coin landscape. It knocked out PEPE on the rankings, with a gap of over $1 billion now between them. Emphatically, WIF’s trajectory puts it right behind Shiba Inu and Dogecoin. However, the asset is much further behind SHIB, with a formidable $14 billion gap.

What’s happening to Litecoin price today? - CoinJournal



                    

                    
Litecoin price reached $110 on Friday, its highest level in over nine months.
A popular crypto analyst says the macro downtrend for LTC may be over.

Litecoin (LTC) currently trades around $104. But earlier in the day, LTC price hovered just above $110, its highest level since last July.
LTC price reached an all-time high of $410 in May 2021. While current prices remain way off that peak, Litecoin’s latest bounce sees analysts predict what could be next.
Litecoin touches $110: Is LTC set for vertical gains?
Before LTC soared more than 15% on Friday, bulls had found it hard to break the psychological $100 level.
Now with price hovering above the mark, a popular crypto analyst says Litecoin price could extend gains if bulls achieve a monthly close at $122.  
“$LTC needs to Monthly Close above the orange resistance ($122) & turn it into support like in 2020/2021 (green circle) to build on its recent Macro Downtrend breakout. Monthly Closing above $122 has historically been a recipe for success for #Litecoin uptrends,” Rekt Capital shared via X.
Before the breakout on Friday, Rekt Capital had noted that LTC could consolidate above $94 amid a new macro uptrend.

Litecoin has pumped in recent weeks amid an overall bullish outlook for crypto. 
The news that Coinbase was looking to add Litecoin futures trading and CFTC’s reference for LTC as a commodity also added to the positive outlook.
LTC is likely one of the altcoins to watch. Notably, Bitcoin’s potential to explode in coming months amid the halving catalyst is adding to LTC sentiment.

Google Enhances Health and Wellness Services with Fitbit AI Integration

In a move that will help the company cement its position in the digital health space, Google has announced an effort to deploy the latest large language model (LLM), which is health- and wellness-tailored, onto its Fitbit app. This also shows the new step that Google is trying to push to develop its commitment further and, in turn, increase the experience of its users using the power of its AI even more. The upcoming AI model tries to provide Fitbit users with much more personalized insights regarding health routines but has been designed in such a way that it analyzes data without giving diagnoses related to health issues or treatments of the same.Personalized health insights at your fingertips With the personalization in health analytics, Google is moving dramatically towards personalized wellness experiences. The new AI model will interpret and give feedback on health data through the Fitbit app. The Fitbit app, in turn, will provide feedback tailored to users on how best they can improve their sleep patterns and exercise routines.The model will contain capabilities to process natural language questions on the number of minutes a user was in their active zone (AZM) during exercises or the kind of sleep they had, to which the model will return intuitive visualizations such as histograms and heatmaps. Part of broader efforts at Google to imbue AI into health and wellness, it offers users insights specifically customized to their unique health profiles. Technology is based on the solid ground of health signals derived from extensive research and validation by certified coaches and wellness professionals from the team.Despite the hype around its potential, Google has yet to announce whether the AI model will run on-device or require the internet further to leave questions at bay on blanks over user privacy and data interoperability. Beyond Fitbit in Google’s broader health initiative That comes on top of AI enhancements expected to go for Fitbit as part of the series of updates by Google about improvements to its health offerings. It also brings in some major changes, such as the addition of Google Lens for health-related searches so that one could explore symptoms or health conditions through the app with visual searches for the same. This will ease the process of understanding the health conditions that need support from quality visual results of credible sources.Aloud has also been instrumental in making health information available to people across the world. Having first focused on First Aid, she is now eagerly waiting for the First Aid, Cancer, and Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) videos to be translated into multiple languages. All these initiatives are an indication of Google’s commitment to the use of AI to make health information more easily understandable and available to people around the world.The intersection of AI and blockchain in healthcare As AI further shifts the goalposts of the healthcare technology landscape, it becomes more important to ensure quality data through ownership, which emerges as an important factor for enterprise blockchain systems. The use of blockchain ensures the health data is securely maintained within a cryptographical immutable framework. Hence, it possibly assures the privacy and data security of health-driven applications based on AI. This consolidation of AI into blockchain technology is on the verge of a much more transparent, secure, and efficient ecosystem of digital health that may very well be laying down the very foundation of future innovations. From the integration of the health-centered AI model into Fitbit to the company’s efforts to improve health and wellness services, Google has all the best new updates. They use this kind of stuff to offer the type of personal health insights required and, hence, provide better access to quality health information, thus taking control of the journey to healthy living. But suppose the tech giant continues to navigate the intricacies of incorporating AI into healthcare. In that case, opportunities are great for this technology to finally bring about radically changed ways of understanding and managing our health far beyond those of any Fitbit-wearing consumer.

What to Expect for Bitcoin (BTC) in the Coming Period? Prominent Analyst Commented - Bitcoin Sistemi


Famous cryptocurrency analyst Michaël van de Poppe talked about the latest situation of Bitcoin in his statement.
According to the analyst, the BTC price experienced a great increase as expected before the halving and even performed better than previous halvings.


Van de Poppe said that within this cycle, the Bitcoin price may rally from $ 300,000 to $ 600,000 and this may be the peak point. Currently, the cryptocurrency world is excitedly waiting for the halving event, which will take place in approximately 21 days.
The analyst is not in a rush for the $100,000 target, which has been talked about in recent weeks. The analyst says that this target will not be realized suddenly, and the 4-year BTC price cycle is still valid. According to the analyst, areas around $60,000 will continue to be support, and areas near the current all-time high will continue to be resistance.






In addition, speaking about the overall cryptocurrency market market value, the analyst argued that we may remain in the consolidation phase for a while before the rally continues.
On the altcoin side, Van de Poppe announced that cryptocurrencies in the Ethereum ecosystem are expected to perform well, including ATOM and DOT.

MetaMask's parent ConsenSys urges SEC to approve Ethereum spot ETF - Crypto Briefing




ConsenSys, the company behind MetaMask, has submitted a public comment letter to the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), advocating for the approval of a spot Ethereum exchange-traded fund (ETF). The letter highlights the robust security features of Ethereum’s Proof of Stake (PoS) mechanism, specifically addressing concerns about potential fraud and manipulation within the network.The SEC’s request for public comments, issued on March 8, seeks insights into whether Ethereum’s PoS could present unique security challenges. ConsenSys responded with a comprehensive argument, asserting that Ethereum’s PoS surpasses the security benchmarks established by Bitcoin’s Proof of Work (PoW), which has already been the basis for approved Bitcoin-based ETFs.According to the firm, launching a successful attack on Ethereum is more expensive than attacking Bitcoin. Plus, an attack on Ethereum would also be much slower. Researchers estimate it could take nearly six months to gain control of the network, while an attack on Bitcoin potentially happens faster.“The total cost to attack on Ethereum would be nearly $34.39 billion (at December 2023 ether prices), and it would take nearly six months.20 The total cost to attack on Bitcoin, consisting mostly of the cost of computer hardware and electricity, would range from just under $5 billion to a little over $20 billion and could be waged more or less immediately. This makes Ethereum significantly more costly to attack than Bitcoin for the particular scenario addressed by the researchers,” wrote ConsenSys.ConsenSys additionally outlined several key advantages of Ethereum’s PoS, including faster block finality, a distributed and randomized validation process, higher network attack costs, and slashing penalties for validators who breach protocol rules. These features, combined with Ethereum’s environmental efficiency and transparent, decentralized community, provide a strong case for the network’s resilience against fraud and manipulation.The letter concludes with a call to the SEC to acknowledge the advanced safeguards inherent in Ethereum’s design, which not only meet but exceed those of Bitcoin-based ETPs.“There is no justifiable reason to deny the listing and trading of the iShares Ethereum Trust based on concerns over ether’s susceptibility to fraud and manipulation. We urge the Commission to recognize the advanced safeguards inherent in Ethereum’s design, which not only meet but exceed the exemplary security and resilience safeguards underlying Bitcoin-based ETPs previously approved by the Commission,” stated ConsenSys.Last month, Coinbase sent a comment letter to the SEC in support of spot Ethereum ETFs. Coinbase’s main claim in the letter is that Ethereum (ETH) is not a security and that Ethereum’s PoS system effectively manages the network and mitigates risks. The firm also cited the recent approval of several spot Bitcoin ETFs as a strong precedent for approving a similar product for Ethereum.

Bitcoin (BTC) Price Still Shaky at $70K, Solana (SOL) Nears $200 (Weekend Watch)


																Bitcoin has returned to $70,000 once again after falling below that level yesterday and failing to overcome it decisively during its recovery phase.
Several altcoins, like ETH, BNB, DOGE, and SHIB, have turned red on a daily scale, but SOL has performed better and stands close to $200.
BTC Returns to $70K
After a relatively quiet weekend, Bitcoin’s business week started on a positive note as the asset soared from around $64,000 to $66,000 before it shot all the way up to $70,000 on Tuesday.
The bulls kept the pressure piling and pushed BTC to a new 15-day peak of just under $72,000 on Wednesday. However, the asset was violently rejected here and driven back down to $68,400 hours later.
Bitcoin began its recovery shortly after and neared $72,000 once more, but to no avail. Another decline followed, and BTC slipped to $69,200 yesterday. Nevertheless, it has managed to recover most losses as of now and sits at just over $70,000.

SOL Heads Toward $200
Soana and Toncoin have popped up as today’s top performers. SOL has gained almost 6% overnight and stands close to $200 once again. TON’s increase is similar, and the asset has jumped to well above $5.
Ripple, Cardano, Avalanche, Polkadot, Chainlink, and Tron are also in the green, albeit in a more modest fashion. BCH has continued its run ahead of its second halving, which is just a few days away, and now trades above $600.
In contrast, ETH and BNB have declined slightly, and so have the two largest meme coins – SHIB and DOGE.
The total crypto market cap has remained relatively stagnant on a daily basis and is below $2.8 trillion now.

The L2 blockchain’s transaction volume on DEX reaches $730 million.



The assets locked on the network increased by over 200%, reaching $3 billion from the $2 billion mark in just 5 days.




In a surprising development, the Base Network witnessed a historic high in transaction volume on March March 29. Reportedly, the Base Network’s transactions recorded an astounding 2.275 million, with transaction volume on DEX reaching $730 million.









Chinese reporter Colin Wu shared insights on the remarkable development of the Base Network via his Wu Blockchain page on X. The journalist also shed light on the increasing market value of network stablecoins, which surged by 55% to more than $1.1 billion, marking record highs.

ChatGPT Analyzes if Dogecoin (DOGE) Can Hit $1 in 2024


																TL;DR

Dogecoin’s jump above $0.20 has sparked speculation about its potential to reach $1 in 2024, with multiple factors being crucial for its future value movement.
Shiba Inu (SHIB) has seen a 200% increase in price over a month, raising questions about its ability to surpass Dogecoin.


What Are the Odds?
The largest meme coin – Dogecoin (DOGE) – has been on a roll lately, with its price jumping by 30% in the past week and exceeding $0.20. We asked ChatGPT whether the resurgence could continue throughout 2024 and if the $1 milestone is reachable.
The popular AI-powered chatbot did not rule out that possibility, estimating that it depends on a variety of factors, with the main one being market adoption.
“If Dogecoin continues to expand its use cases and gains wider adoption as a payment method or for other services, this could positively impact its price.”
Earlier this month, Tesla’s CEO Elon Musk revealed that the EV giant might accept DOGE as a payment method “at some point.”
Musk has endorsed the meme coin countless times in the last few years, triggering substantial price rallies on most occasions. 




“Continued support by Musk or prominent company could drive the price up,” ChatGPT stated.
Favorable crypto market trends were named by ChatGPT next. According to the chatbot, a bullish cycle prevailing in the entire sector might lift the prices of numerous meme coins, including DOGE. Some analysts believe the industry is yet to witness a real bull run due to the upcoming Bitcoin halving (scheduled for next month).
Other factors that might also positively impact Dogecoin’s value in the future include technological developments, regulatory environment, investor sentiment, and economic conditions.
Can SHIB Step on DOGE’s Throne?
Another meme coin that has made waves recently is Shiba Inu (SHIB). The asset’s price has exploded by over 200% on a monthly scale, with its market cap briefly increasing above a whopping $25 billion. 
Not long ago, we asked ChatGPT whether the token could flip DOGE this year. The chatbot estimated that such a scenario depends on the further development of the Shiba Inu community. As CryptoPotato reported, SHIB has the strongest base among all meme coins, followed by Dogecoin and Pepe Coin.
Technological advancements related to the layer-2 scaling solution Shibarium could play a role, too. The network, launched in August last year, has completed several strategic milestones in the past several months. Most recently, total transactions surpassed the 400 million mark.
Those willing to learn more about Shibarium’s purposes, please take a look at our dedicated video below:

Union Street Revival: AI Imagery Aims to Rejuvenate Aberdeen's Granite Mile

In an innovative move to revitalize Union Street, Aberdeen, the campaign group Our Union Street is leveraging artificial intelligence (AI) to entice traders by showcasing the potential transformation of vacant shops. This strategy is part of a broader effort to invigorate business in Aberdeen’s Granite Mile, addressing the challenge of attracting new businesses to the area.A strategic use of AI TechnologyThe use of AI-generated images to reimagine empty retail spaces marks a significant shift in tactics for urban redevelopment. Spearheaded by Our Union Street leaders Bob Keiller and Derrick Thomson, the initiative seeks to fill approximately 10 more units by the end of next year. The group believes that by demonstrating how derelict properties can be transformed into vibrant businesses, they can more effectively persuade potential tenants to commit to Union Street.AI technology allows for rapid visualization of future businesses in the current vacant spaces. Whether a prospective tenant is considering opening a bike shop, bakery, or restaurant, AI-generated images can provide a compelling glimpse into what each space could become in just a few hours. This approach not only saves time but also significantly reduces the costs associated with traditional methods of property visualization, which can be both time-consuming and expensive.The impact on union street’s revival effortsThe introduction of AI imagery has already made a notable difference in the campaign to rejuvenate Union Street. Over the past year, Our Union Street has successfully reduced the number of unused properties from 53 to 25. This progress is attributed to the group’s persistent efforts to attract new businesses and the innovative use of technology to showcase the potential of vacant units.The collaboration with architecture graduates from Robert Gordon University has been instrumental in generating these AI images. Their expertise and access to cutting-edge technology have enabled the creation of dozens of visualizations, which are shared on the Our Union Street website to spark interest among potential tenants.This strategy has reportedly saved the campaign approximately £60,000, funds that can be redirected towards further revitalization efforts. With the ground-level units gaining traction, Our Union Street plans to extend its focus to the upper stories of Union Street buildings, aiming for a comprehensive enhancement of the area.Challenges and solutionsOne of the major hurdles in the campaign to populate Union Street with thriving businesses is the initial state of the vacant units. Many of these spaces are in poor condition, making it difficult for potential tenants to envision their business operating there. Traditional methods of property visualization, including sketching, modeling, and Photoshop, although effective, are not only costly but also time-consuming, often taking days to produce a single image.The adoption of AI technology offers a solution to these challenges. By providing quick and cost-effective visualizations, Our Union Street can overcome the reluctance of potential tenants to invest in these spaces. This approach allows for a diverse range of business concepts to be explored and presented in a visually appealing manner, making it easier for entrepreneurs to see the potential in Union Street’s vacant units.The initiative by Our Union Street to use AI-generated images for the revival of Union Street is a testament to the innovative approaches being adopted in urban redevelopment. This strategy not only demonstrates the potential of technology in transforming real estate marketing but also highlights the importance of community-led efforts in revitalizing urban areas. As Aberdeen’s Granite Mile begins to attract more businesses, the hope is that this will spur further investment and renewal, breathing new life into the historic heart of the city.Through the strategic use of AI imagery, Our Union Street is setting a precedent for urban regeneration efforts worldwide, showcasing how technology and community collaboration can work hand in hand to achieve significant improvements in urban landscapes.

Grayscale's Bitcoin Bull Market Report: Key Insights and Predictions | Cryptoglobe


                                
In a recent research report, Grayscale Investments, a well-known digital asset management firm, has offered its perspective on the current state of the Bitcoin market and the factors driving its bullish momentum. The report suggests that we are currently in the middle of a bull run, drawing comparisons to the fifth inning of a baseball game, with ample room for further growth.



According to Grayscale, the current Bitcoin bull cycle is being propelled by a combination of technical and fundamental drivers. On the technical side, the report highlights the significant impact of spot Bitcoin ETF inflows, which have consistently surpassed Bitcoin issuance, creating upward pressure on prices. Grayscale also points to the positive influence of stablecoin inflows and the substantial increase in Total Value Locked (TVL) in DeFi applications as key fundamental factors supporting the current bull market.







            
            

            
            

            
            

        

The report by Grayscale also delves into the cyclical indicators that suggest Bitcoin is in the middle of its bull run. The analysis of the Market Value Realized Value (MVRV) and Net Unrealized Profit/Loss (NUPL) ratios indicates that while progress has been made, there is still potential for further growth. However, Grayscale also acknowledges the need for investors to remain vigilant, closely monitoring spot Bitcoin ETF flows and macroeconomic indicators for signs of potential market shifts.



Despite the impressive price appreciation witnessed in early 2024, Grayscale maintains a cautiously optimistic outlook for Bitcoin’s future performance. The report highlights the potential for increased retail and institutional participation to act as additional catalysts, further propelling the bull run. Grayscale also notes that while certain institutional players remain on the sidelines, a growing number of firms are beginning to approve the inclusion of spot Bitcoin ETFs in advisor-managed portfolios, signaling untapped investment potential.



Looking ahead, Grayscale emphasizes the importance of keeping a close eye on spot Bitcoin ETF flows and macroeconomic indicators, as these factors are likely to play a crucial role in shaping the near-term direction of Bitcoin’s bull cycle. The report also acknowledges the inherent volatility of cryptocurrencies and the possibility of periodic drawdowns within bull markets. However, Grayscale maintains its long-term conviction in Bitcoin’s performance as an asset class, citing its unique characteristics as a store of value and hard money.

April Will Be a ‘Very Interesting Month’ for Bitcoin and Crypto, Says Benjamin Cowen - Here’s What He Means - The Daily Hodl


								Analyst Benjamin Cowen is putting out his forecast for Bitcoin (BTC) and the crypto market over the coming month.
Cowen tells his 796,000 YouTube subscribers in a new video that he thinks “April is going to be a very interesting month” for the crypto industry.










“I expect a ton of volatility in April especially as alt/Bitcoin pairs are starting to roll over, especially as Bitcoin dominance is potentially starting to break out.”
Bitcoin is trading at $70,083 at time of writing.
According to Cowen, the sentiment in the market will turn bearish if Bitcoin dominance (BTC.D), which measures Bitcoin’s share of the crypto markets, rises by a little over five percentage points from the current level.
In a bearish environment, a rising BTC.D suggests that altcoins are losing value faster than Bitcoin.
“We are getting pretty close. The range here that we’re looking at is 55.3%. So above 55.3%, that could be the warning sign. That could be the risk-off signal for the summer. And that’s what I would be looking at going into the summer months.”
The Bitcoin dominance level is at 49.6% at time of writing.
The widely followed analyst says that whether Bitcoin peaks early during this cycle (left-translated peak) or peaks more than a year after the halving (normal cycle peak), will likely be determined by US monetary policy.
“Whether it is a normal cycle peak or a left-translated peak will probably depend on what happens in the fourth quarter (Q4) this year. That’s my view. If Bitcoin in Q4 is crashing in a recession-like environment as the unemployment rate is just sort of going higher…if that happens and we get some type of like mild recession and then the Federal Reserve just starts printing again, then why not have another rally in 2025?”

April Altcoins: These 3 Coins Could Surpass Bitcoin (BTC) Growth


April altcoins are setting the stage for a potential market upheaval, predicted to outshine Bitcoin (BTC) significantly. Among these, ALGO stands out with its recent “Golden Cross” formation on the 4-hour price chart, an indicator that could herald the beginning of a new bull run. 
Additionally, GT has captured attention by growing an impressive 98.10% over the past month. Its price trajectory suggests that this uptrend might intensify in April. Meanwhile, CAKE is poised to hit its highest price since May 2022, presenting a compelling case for investors looking for lucrative opportunities outside the Bitcoin domain.
ALGO Just Formed A “Golden Cross”
Coin: Algorand (ALGO)Price: $0.27Market Cap: $2.26B
Algorand is a decentralized, secure, and scalable platform for digital currency and smart contracts. Leveraging a variant of Proof-of-Stake (PoS) known as Pure PoS (PPoS), its protocol ensures network security and achieves consensus for block production.
ALGO price grew almost 17% this year. Although its growth is still behind other coins, ALGO could be getting ready for a huge bull run, as its 4H price chart shows its EMA lines just formed a “Golden Cross”. 
ALGO 4H Price Chart and EMA Lines. Source: TradingView.
Exponential Moving Averages (EMAs) are a moving average that places a greater weight and significance on the most recent data points, making them particularly responsive to new market information. 

The Golden Cross is a bullish signal observed on price charts, occurring when a shorter-term EMA crosses above a longer-term EMA. This event is seen as a positive sign, suggesting that a market could be moving from a downtrend to an uptrend, indicating potential long-term growth ahead.
Read More: Algorand (ALGO) Price Prediction 2024/2025/2030
If the uptrend continues, ALGO will probably test its previous resistance at $0.32. If that one is broken, Algorand could continue rising to test the next resistance at $0.41 in April. 
April Altcoins to Buy: GT Is Getting Momentum
Coin: Gatetoken (GT)Price: $10.10Market Cap: $1.33B
GateToken (GT) serves as the foundational utility token of the Gate.io exchange platform, crafted to enable a multitude of functions and services within its ecosystem. Users holding GT can leverage the token to cover trading fees, engage in token sales, gain access to unique features and promotions, and benefit from discounts and rewards.
GT is only 22.19% below its all-time high (ATH), reached on May 12, 2021. The coin grew 98.10% during the past month, reaching the $10 price level for the first time since May 10, 2021. 
GT 4H Price Chart and EMA Lines. Source: TradingView.

The GT 4H chart shows a rising trend. The EMAs for 20, 50, 100, and 200 periods line up in a bullish pattern. The 20-period EMA leads this lineup, hinting at strong momentum. Prices are beating these averages.
Price candles remain over the 20-EMA. This confirms the trend, suggesting buyers are in charge. The pattern of rising lows and highs also signals an uptrend.
If this holds, GT may retest its old high of $12.83 from April. The technical signs and market activity suggest a bright outlook for GT in the near to medium term. They point to potential continued gains.
CAKE Is on Track to Hit Its Highest Price Level Since May 2022
Coin: PancakeSwap (CAKE)Price: $4.64Market Cap: $1.15B
PancakeSwap is a decentralized finance (DeFi) platform where users can engage in cryptocurrency trading, earn rewards via staking and farming, take part in lotteries, and have a say in governance choices. It runs on the Binance Smart Chain, emphasizing reduced transaction costs and speedy processing. CAKE is its native coin.

CAKE grew 48.54% in the last month, but it’s still 89.42% below its ATH reached in April 2021. This suggests CAKE has a lot of room for growth. 
CAKE 4H Price Chart and EMA Lines. Source: TradingView.
The CAKE 4-hour chart shows a bullish trend. Short-term EMAs (20 and 50) are above the long-term ones (100 and 200). This signals ongoing momentum. CAKE’s price is near the $5.03 resistance. A break above it may extend the uptrend. This is due to the bullish EMA setup. The EMAs could provide support if the price dips.
Read More: 3 Hidden Gem Altcoins to Watch Out for in April
CAKE aims for the May 2022 high of $7.71. It needs to keep up the bullishness and buy support to get there. If it passes $5.03, that level could become a new support. Still, investors should watch out. The path to $7.71 has several resistances to clear. Each could test the uptrend’s strength.

Bitcoin Price Prediction
As we approach the end of March, Bitcoin (BTC/USD) has managed a slight uptick, trading at $70,050, a modest increase of around 0.25%.The cryptocurrency seems to be treading cautiously around a pivot point of $68,770, suggesting an ongoing tussle between bullish sentiment and market hesitation.Immediate resistance is observed at $71,600, with further challenges lying at $73,545 and $75,575. These levels will be critical to breach for Bitcoin to sustain a bullish momentum.Conversely, Bitcoin finds intermediate support at $66,820, with additional safety nets at $64,985 and $62,980.Bitcoin Price Chart – Source: TradingviewThe 50-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA) at $68,750 is currently acting as a support for the buying trend, and the Relative Strength Index (RSI) hovering above 50 bolsters this perspective.However, the appearance of a triple top pattern around $71,600 could signal resistance, potentially capping upward movements.In sum, Bitcoin’s trajectory maintains a bullish tone as long as it trades above the pivot point, yet a dip below could signal a sharp bearish adjustment.Catch the Slothana Wave: Invest in $SLOTH Before It Hits the Market

Shiba Inu is on the verge of losing the $0.00003 price threshold. This price point has been crucial for SHIB as it has struggled to maintain its position above this threshold. The breakdown will most likely lead to a crucial price reversal.When we look at SHIB's price chart, we see that the price went up sharply not too long ago. But now that excitement is less, and the price is going down toward that important $0.00003 level. If SHIB's price goes under this, it might keep going down even more.SHIB/USDT Chart by TradingViewThere are two prices to keep an eye on now: $0.000027 and $0.000021. These are major support levels for SHIB's price. If SHIB's price goes below $0.00003, these levels could be where the price stops falling and starts to stabilize.But there is also a chance that SHIB's price could go back up. If people start to get interested in SHIB again and buy more of it, the price could rise above $0.00003 once more. The most likely reasoning behind this would be a general market reversal. Additionally, we might see a scenario like this play out after Shiba Inu's correction ends and buying power returns to the market.What happens next with SHIB will depend a lot on whether more people want to buy or sell. If buyers think the price is low and a good deal, we might see the price go up again.The overall mood about meme coins like SHIB can also make a big difference. In general, the meme coin industry is getting more strength, however, Ethereum-based meme coins are not yet gaining enough traction. Leading chains for memes are Base and Solana.

Bitcoin Dogs is a project that is looking to leverage the growth of the Bitcoin blockchain in recent years. It will provide utility to users and is the first BRC-20 token ICO on the Bitcoin network.
According to their whitepaper, Bitcoin Dogs is set to offer investors an exciting value proposition by combining the basic features of cryptocurrency, non-fungible tokens (NFTs), decentralised finance (DeFi), and Web3 culture.
Bitcoin Dogs has concluded its ICO and raised nearly $13.5 million. The team is now focused on rolling out its products and listing its token on cryptocurrency exchanges. 
The team announced earlier this week that it is preparing to launch the biggest NFT mint on the Bitcoin network. 
The project could also benefit from the upcoming Bitcoin halving event. The halving event could see BTC rally higher and could benefit projects on the Bitcoin network. With the right level of adoption, Bitcoin Dogs could set the trend that would allow the Bitcoin blockchain to compete with Ethereum and BNBChain in terms of ICOs.
Bitcoin Dogs prepares to list on crypto exchanges
The Bitcoin Dogs presale was concluded a few days ago and the project raised nearly $13.5 million. 
The team will only mint 900 million $0DOG tokens. Furthermore, investors would be granted access to an exclusive NFT collection and an immersive gaming ecosystem.


🚀 Brace yourselves, dawgs and degens! 🐾 
Something BIG is brewing in the BitcoinDogs universe… 🌟 
Get ready to witness history in the making with our upcoming NFT mint! 💎🔥 https://t.co/KsAXLUycsk pic.twitter.com/UPYfL41Ynt

In this spirit, Bitcoin Dogs is currently preparing for the biggest NFT mint on the Bitcoin network. The next step will also see its $0DOG token get listed on cryptocurrency exchanges. 
Click here to learn more about the recently concluded Bitcoin Dogs presale.
Should you buy the Bitcoin Dogs token once it is listed on exchanges?
The Bitcoin Dogs presale is now over, which means it is impossible to buy the $0DOG token from the official website. The team is preparing to list $0DOG on several crypto exchanges, allowing thousands of investors to have access to the project. 
The crypto market has been bullish since the start of the year and projects with utility like Bitcoin Dogs could record excellent gains in the medium to long term. With the right level of adoption, Bitcoin Dogs could be one of the tokens to soar higher.

With the current token price of just $0.06 and over 96.50% of the presale stage 2 already completed, the opportunity to secure ALGT tokens at these bargain basement prices is quickly disappearing.Chainlink’s Meteoric Rise To $49Chainlink started trading for just $0.11 when it launched its ICO in September 2017. Those who got in at that ground-floor price have seen extraordinary gains, as LINK reached an all-time high of $49 in 2021. The pioneering Oracle network solved the key issue of connecting real-world data to blockchain smart contracts in a secure and decentralized manner.As more projects integrated Chainlink’s Oracle services, the value and usage of the LINK token exploded. From under $1 at the start of 2021, LINK rose parabolic before a broader crypto market pullback. Even after the correction, LINK still trades well around $20 today on robust, lasting demand, according to the data from CoinMarketcap.Algotech Steals Attention With Record $3.4M Presale Markets move at lightning speed, whipsawing on every new tweet or rumor.

This Week in Coins: Bitcoin Hovers Around $70,000-But Meme Coins Steal the Show - Decrypt

Illustration by Mitchell Preffer for Decrypt.Bitcoin is up over the week, having risen over 10% the past seven days. Its price now stands at $69,966, per CoinGecko—still below the nearly $74,000 all-time high it touched earlier this month.But most of this week's action has been focused elsewhere: in the world of meme coins and tokens.Out of the top cryptocurrencies by market cap, one of the biggest winners of the week is Dogecoin. The ninth biggest digital asset is up nearly 45% in seven days and is now priced at $0.208.It has only been beaten by Bitcoin Cash, the 15th biggest coin, which has shot up in value over the week by over 30% and by over 50% in 30 days.In the fast-moving meme coin world, other tokens have surged. Most notably, Dogwifhat, which is this week's best-performing cryptocurrency. The Solana-based token is up nearly 100% over the week and is priced at $4.52 as of writing.It has been on a tear this week following the rise of major coins and tokens. Usually, when the likes of Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Solana rise, memes can ride on the back of them.Another major meme, Shiba Inu, has also had a lot of luck this week: the Dogecoin-competitor has jumped over 1o% in value the past seven days, sitting at $0.00003 early Saturday.Other memes comandeering the spotlight include Solana-based Bonk and Pepe, which are up 23% and 6%, respectively.Major coins like Ethereum and Solana have also risen in price over the past week—albeit slightly.

CFTC’s Approach In KuCoin Case May Undermine SEC’s Authority, Commissioner Warns


								Following a recent lawsuit against prominent crypto exchange KuCoin, Caroline D. Pharm, a Commissioner at the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) has warned that the agency may be infringing on the Securities and Exchange Commission’s authority in regards to securities trading. This development comes as both financial regulators continue the tussle over the control of the crypto space amidst the lack of a clear regulatory framework for the US crypto industry.

CFTC May Be Tampering With Investor Protection Law, Pharm Says
On March 26, the CFTC, alongside the US Department of Justice, filed a lawsuit against KuCoin and two of its founders for conspiracy to violate the Bank Secrecy Act and conduct an unregistered money transmitter operation. The petition, which was submitted in the Southern District of New York, also charges all parties for not conducting the required know-your-customer practices and breaching the US anti-money laundering laws.
Commenting on this development in a public statement released on March 29, the CFTC commissioner Caroline Pharm states the agency has taken an “aggressive” stance in performing its duties in regards to halting the operations of an unlicensed crypto derivatives trading firm. While Pharm commended the CFTC’s commitment and alertness in safeguarding the US financial markets, the commissioner says this recent lawsuit may undermine the SEC’s jurisdiction over securities trading.
This is because the CTFC complaints against KuCoin claim that according to Section2(c)2(D) of the Commodity Exchange Act, securities can be used in leverage trading, which regulation falls under the agency’s authority; Commissioner Pharm warns that the interpretation of this law does not provide enough differentiation of security and the trading activities of one. 
Thus, Pharm states that the CFTC’s argument in this latest lawsuit could infringe on the SEC’s jurisdiction as well as threaten the validity of existing investor protection laws. The Commissioner said:
The CFTC’s approach may infringe upon the SEC’s authority and undermine decades of robust investor protection laws by conflating a financial instrument with a financial activity, disrupting the foundations of securities markets. Owning shares is not the same thing as trading derivatives.”

The Crypto Turf War Continues
Over the last few years, the CFTC and the SEC have battled for regulatory supremacy over the robust US crypto industry. While the CFTC continues to regulate the crypto futures and derivatives trading and the SEC focuses on processes involved in initial coin offerings (ICO), both regulators have attempted to gain greater control of the crypto space. 
Back in March 2022, the CFTC chairman Rostin Behman in a testimony before the Senate Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry, openly called for an expansion of the agency’s jurisdiction to other aspects of digital asset trading, 
This is a similar call to repetitive petitions by the SEC’s boss Gary Gensler who is also seeking greater authority from the US Congress to exert an increased influence on crypto regulations. Obviously, the existing battle between both regulators for higher regulations is unbeneficial to crypto investors and only signals the need for the hastening of the legislative process involved in the creation of clear crypto regulations.

Is HODLing XRP a good choice for this market cycle? Data says… - AMBCrypto



The market cap to revenue ratio revealed that the token might attract only a few buyers.
XRP’s price could increase but $1 might be a struggle.

Anyone who has held Ripple [XRP] since it hit its peak in 2018 would agree that being faithful to the project has been an extreme sport. While there are high hopes that the token might recover this cycle, tokenomics seems to disagree.
AMBCrypto discovered this after analyzing Ripple’s revenue from XRP transactions and its market cap.  According to data from Messari, XRP’s revenue exceeded $560 million over the last 365 days.
While the token had fallen to 6th in terms of market cap, the value was $34.56 billion. When divided by each other, the ratio of market cap to revenue gives a reading of 61.18.
Too many stumbling blocks
This ratio is considered high and might be detrimental to XRP as investors might consider the cryptocurrency not worthy of buying.
But the cryptocurrency’s problem is not limited to that. Another factor that has hindered XRP’s growth is its supply.
The token fundamentally has a total supply of 100 billion. Out of this, 54.88 billion were in circulation. If there is a high supply, and demand for the cryptocurrency remains low, the price would find it difficult to appreciate. This was XRP’s story.
With this condition, and no headway in sight per Ripple’s lawsuit with the SEC, XRP might find it difficult to exhibit top performance this time.
AMBCrypto’s analysis of the project’s on-chain status also reinforced this sentiment. For example, in December 2023, Ripple’s network growth was 8189, indicating an influx of new addresses interacting with the project.
Source: Santiment
However, that number had fallen below 800, meaning that the adoption of XRP was 10 times less. However, stablecoin supply by whales on the network has been increasing.
Respite for the road
But this does not guarantee that whales are arming themselves with buying power to accumulate XRP. If this is the case, then good for the token. However, there is no guarantee that the price would climb toward $3.40 as it did in 2018.
Moreover, we dissected the token’s price potential. On the daily timeframe, the 50 EMA (blue) had crossed over the 200 EMA (yellow), suggesting that XRP had a long-term bullish potential.
However, both EMAs were too close to the price which stood at $0.62. This position signaled that while the price might extend, making an out-of-this-world rally seems unlikely.

Read Ripple’s [XRP] Price Prediction 2024-2025

We also looked at the Money Flow Index (MFI). Though the MFI reading was lower, it had started to recover, suggesting that capital was flowing into the cryptocurrency.
For the short term, the price of XRP might climb toward $0.68. However, the long-term prediction might be a bit conservative. In a highly bullish case, the token might trade less than $1.

Bitcoin wallet dormant for 12 years suddenly moves 500 BTC - CoinJournal



                    

                    
According to on-chain data, a Satoshi era wallet has suddenly moved 500 BTC.
The Bitcoin wallet last transacted when the BTC price hovered near $8.

On-chain data shows a Bitcoin wallet that last transacted nearly 12 years ago has suddenly moved all 500 BTC it held.
According to data Lookonchain shared on March 30, the said wallet had been inactive since July 2012. 
The last transaction that sent the 500 BTC to the wallet was at a time when Bitcoin price was a mere $8, Lookonchain noted.

A wallet that had been dormant for 11.7 years transferred all 500 $BTC($34.78M) to multiple new wallets.
This wallet received 500 $BTC($3,786 at the time) on Jul 14, 2012, when the price of $BTC was only $7.57.

— Lookonchain (@lookonchain) March 30, 2024

While the wallet owner’s identity is unknown, the transfer to new addresses comes as Bitcoin price hovers around $70k. The benchmark cryptocurrency reached a new all-time high this month when it raced above $73k.
At current prices, the transferred coins are worth about $35 million.
In April last year, another Satoshi-ear wallet woke up after a decade of dormancy. The wallet, held 1,128 BTC and had last been active in 2012, transferred 279 BTC. The last transaction from this wallet had been when Bitcoin price was around $12.

Microsoft and OpenAI to Collaborate on $100 Billion AI Data Center Project

In a ground-breaking partnership led by top tech companies of Microsoft and OpenAI, they are attempting to transform the face of AI technology through a gigantic mission that could revolutionize how artificial intelligence is perceived. As reported in the news, the program is setting up a suitable data center with the working name “Stargate.” AI supercomputer is assigned to the project. By 2028, the venture is expected to be introduced, making it a notable stride towards the latest AI infrastructure to help in the growing need for advanced AI systems.Ambitious plans unveiledThe scheme, estimated to be an eye-watering $100 billion, exhibits that Microsoft and OpenAI’s position in AI field development is not accidental. At the core of the system is the supercomputer named “Stargate,” which will take the place of the leader in the AI research field and other related endeavors of the future. Placing this project under the concept of speedy generative AI tech adoption, a key mission is to respond to the increased complexity of tasks by enhancing the performance of sophisticated AI data centers.The project’s leader, Microsoft, is in a position of being a venture of data center investments that far surpasses what is past. Concerning the supercomputer of U.S.-based data, it is believed that it will be the largest in a series of forthcoming installations, eventually overtaking the size of some of the greatest data centers on the planet by 100 times their space. It reveals the spirit of naturopathy of both enterprises behind the utilization of AI to advance innovations in different fields.In an exclusive about the confidential discussions, the final cipher of $100 billion was allocated into five phases, where “Stargate” is the anticipated summit of this elaborate plan. Nvidia and TSM, along with Google and the University of Michigan, are now in the third phase, with abundant investments for obtaining AI chips, a capability needed in driving sophisticated AI computations. A prominent feature is the price coverage anticipated to include expenses related to sourcing chips from different suppliers.Pioneering the future of AI infrastructureMoreover, according to the questions Microsoft asked about the same project, Microsoft’s approach was cryptic, emphasizing the company’s continuous dedication to developing and providing an AI infrastructure. Concerning the “Stargate” large-scale machine, a Microsoft spokesperson has declined to make any direct comments. Yet, he has repeated the corporation’s efforts to expand the limits of AI and use cutting-edge infrastructure solutions to solve the problem.The suggested project undoubtedly happens to be the novel beginning of the joint efforts of the top industry titans as they continue to ensure AI superiority. AI-driven technologies are closing in with the constant surge in demand. Microsoft and OpenAI’s undertaking shows the determination of both organizations to rise to the occasion in the frontier of AI infrastructure. Exiting “the Gate” will establish the project as the benchmark of AI’s capability and provide avenues for restructuring the current AI research and development paradigm.Original story from: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2311.18828.pdf

Legendary investor and Bitcoin fan Tim Draper has shocked crypto X with revelations of his historic bet on the premier digital currency.Tim Draper’s 10x yield on dollarIn his revelation, Tim Draper said he invested 300 Bitcoin in a crypto startup, bagging a 4% stake in the unnamed company. He said the investment earned him 15 BTC in 10 years. While this figure appeared small as many on crypto X believed, Tim Draper highlighted how the earned returns marked a 15x return on his money when measured in dollar terms.Many investors have different theories about investing their Bitcoin for equity. While Bitcoin has increased in value considerably over the 10 years, the actual spending power of the U.S. dollar has declined, making the investment worth it overall. The revelation from Tim Draper has solidified another expert’s thesis on why Bitcoin is a better hedge against inflation. In Draper’s position, eventually, there is bound to be total Bitcoinization of the world. Draper’s optimism for Bitcoin’s luster is best showcased in his price projections overall.He believes Bitcoin has the potential to soar to $250,000 by 2025, a prediction that is looking more likely by the day.Bitcoin and multiple growth catalystsIn the Bitcoin ecosystem, there is a deep confidence that the digital currency will jump to unprecedented highs shortly. The spot Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) product in the United States and the forthcoming BTC halving event are fueling investor optimism to go long on the digital currency.While the spot Bitcoin ETF products create the demand, the halving event will trigger a supply crunch, carving out a complimentary synergy that can help the valuation explode ultimately.In line with the bullish fundamentals, other known Bitcoin bulls have even projected up to a $1 million target for the coin. Samson Mow is a major advocate of this price target.

Microsoft Unveils New Azure AI Safety Features to Shield Against AI Hallucinations

Microsoft has pushed an advanced toolkit of features to enhance the security of the Azure AI platform. Sarah Bind, Microsoft Sentient AI Initiative’s principal product officer, will launch a range of tools thoughtfully designed to address the risks of using AI-enabled applications. At the preview stage, the new security precautions will shield Azure AI from threats, provide guarded answers, and protect against promoting and hidden malicious prompt injection without necessitating specific red teams.Microsoft Azure’s advanced AI safety toolsAddressing these concerns is paramount in effectively integrating AI technology into the public sector, as it is crucial to mitigate unforeseen risks and concerns that may hinder its implementation and long-term success.The tip of the iceberg tools such as Prompt Shields, Groundedness Detection, and elaborate vulnerability assessment to help screen the model vulnerabilities have also been unveiled. The Prompt Shields provide a gateway that blocks malicious prompt injection and protects users against the risk of employing AI against the digital world through AI models by prohibiting the use of banned language/covert prompts as they might lead to the exploitation of user inputs and third-party data. This becomes particularly important especially when avoiding the production of material that is fake or inaccurate about the historical events, which was a challenge experienced in AI-driven modelsAI security and hallucination mitigation in Azure’s ecosystemText-based Hallucination Mitigation, another essential part of Microsoft’s safety toolkit, is directed at a series of hallucinations and neutralization. Accomplishing this creates an environment where not just any idea is acceptable; only those supported by evidence and can be verifiable are the most suitable inputs into AI systems. Moreover, safety evaluations will enable in-depth monitoring of models’ vulnerabilities so that these weaknesses can be immediately identified and the security measures can subsequently be adjusted as needed. Considering this, Microsoft is ready to cater to individual customer needs and adequate AI security measures. Azure customers can customize their settings by including or excluding gender-biased content, hate speech, and other demeaning content that resonates with their specific needs. Similarly, such a future upgrade will also be helpful to administrators in determining whether a user is a true tester or a malicious user by providing a reporting feature.Microsoft’s pioneering approach to secure and ethical AI developmentThe significance of these safety measures covers not only the immediate benefits of security but also the fact that the information technology industry imbibes a holistic approach to AI development, which is socially responsible. Integration of these tools, such as Llama, into leading versions like GPT-4 and Llama 2 would mean that a long list of AI applications on Azure AI would depend on higher fraud and error control measures. However, the fact that open-source models that are not so popular may require the user to manually integrate the safety tools into the main system is a side note. These enforcing features are recognized as part of Microsoft’s comprehensive strategy of creating a security and ethical AI environment. Azure AI clients (e.g., KPMG, AT&T, Reddit) constitute major powers that aim to implement advancements across various fields. Thus, their impact is expected to be broad. Furthermore, Microsoft, through the partnership with OpenAI and the launch of the Azure OpenAI Service, serves as evidence that it is the main power in the AI domain, offering the tools developers and organizations need to achieve competence in AI applications.The last auto-safety feature of Microsoft is indicated as a response to the great risks produced by the speech of artificial intelligence technologies. By delving into ways that AI can be shielded from security threats therein and making the live outputs of AI tools accurate, Microsoft, in such a way, is defining a new code of AI security. They improve AI solutions’ safety, integrity, and dependability and help the AI responsible use discourse to evolve.The more artificial intelligence develops, the more the necessity of safe supervision undoubtedly increases. With these novel security technologies, Microsoft moves the goalpost significantly higher toward a truly secure and ethical AI paradigm. With these safeguards, Azure customers of AI can be confident that they can implement auto machines into their operations with a full understanding of all the possible risks artificial intelligence entails.Original story fromhttps://thehorizon.ai/microsofts-new-safety-system-can-catch-hallucinations-in-its-customers-ai-apps

Revolutionizing Social Media: Elon Musk's xAI to Launch Grok-1.5 on Platform X

None other than the maverick entrepreneur behind companies like Tesla and SpaceX, who had, once again, hit the limelight across the globe because of a groundbreaking announcement from his xAI artificial intelligence startup, is none other than Elon Musk. Next week, the company is set to launch an improved AI chatbot version, Grok-1.5, on the social media platform X. This could prove transformative for how users engage with social media and represent a new paradigm in the generative AI competitive landscape.A leap in AI technologyGrok-1.5 represents a leap ahead in the capabilities of AI chatbots and is designed to outperform even the best modern technology in every criterion. Musk announced that Grok-1.5 is already being trained and will bring improved long-context understanding, better than human capability, and advanced reasoning skills. The AI model will be shared with X’s early testers and its first batches of existing users, offering a very rare peek into the kinds of software tools social media companies are developing for the near future.Revolutionizing social media with AI The integration of Grok-1.5 into the X platform implies an overhaul of how social media platforms are perceived and used. More than mere communication tools, platforms powered by AI chatbots like Grok-1.5 are the closest thing to a complete solution to serve their users’ needs for information and entertainment.The ability to seek answers right there on the platform saved users from having to go elsewhere for the same, making their using the platform an all-encompassing experience by far.Grok-1.5 comes in two distinct modes: Regular and Fun. The best, clear, and articulated answers to questions from the user are called Regular mode. The best answers with a touch of sarcasm and wisecracks are called Fun mode. The double implementation would increase the attractiveness of the platform to the larger spectrum of preferences from users with opposing views, thus netting more engagement and activity to the platform. Currently, access to Grok is only available to X’s premium subscribers, therefore making their subscription model more appealing.A new era of competitive AI With this launch, Grok-1.5 thus firmly cements xAI as a formidable competitor in the generative AI space that was largely dominated by the likes of established players such as OpenAI’s ChatGPT, Google’s Bard, or GitHub’s Copilot.It comes weeks after Musk berated OpenAI for moving toward a for-profit model, underlining his determination to meet the original vision laid out to democratize AI as a universally beneficial tool. Xs is the embodiment of future AI not only in the most ambitious sense but also at the very core of innovation and dedication to user-centric design.Implications for the future of social mediaWith such highly energetic users assisted by AI chatbots, platforms like X ensure an experience that is highly efficient and personalized. This not only raises the satisfaction of the user but also sets a new standard for what role AI can play in our digital lives. While the social media platform continues to expand, the growing implementation of modern AI technologies, like Grok-1.5, is one of the essential key discriminators for user preference and orientation toward loyalty on that platform. That is the type of development that one would see as heralding the future of AI, not only in an improved light on our online interactions but fundamentally different in approach to both discovery and consumption of information. In other words, this is really the “game-changer” in social media to come out with the release of Grok-1.5 by xAI on the X platform. Grok-1.5 looks toward setting new user engagement benchmarks and cementing the standing of xAI in the generative AI chatbot market. This comes with more advanced capabilities and innovative features. As this unfolds, the world watches in great anticipation, and certainly, it almost seems like we have seen nothing yet. This means the future of social media will evidently continue to be modified through the transforming power of artificial intelligence.

Spot Ethereum ETF: Consensys Makes Compelling Case for Approval

Consensys, a prominent player in the blockchain and Web3 software space, has submitted a compelling argument to the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), urging it to recognize the advanced safeguards inherent in Ethereum’s design and grant approval of a spot Ethereum exchange-traded fund (ETF).Consensys' argument for Ethereum ETF approvalIn their comment letter to the SEC, Consensys addresses concerns raised by the Commission regarding Ethereum's proof-of-stake (PoS) consensus mechanism and the potential for fraud and manipulation.In Consensys’ response to the regulatory body, it maintains that the SEC's scrutiny and concerns are “wholly without merit” given that Bitcoin-based ETFs have already been approved for trading by the SEC. They maintain that the anti-fraud and anti-manipulation mechanisms present in Ethereum's PoS are more robust and surpass the resilience of Bitcoin's PoW consensus model against tampering.The comment letter highlighted key reasons the SEC should go ahead and grant approval. Consensys insisted that Ethereum's transition to PoS enables provable transaction finality, ensuring that blocks are irreversibly confirmed in a shorter time frame compared to PoW systems.Its PoS model involves segregated roles for block validators, which prevents concentrated control. This, it claims, mitigates the risk of manipulation and adds an extra layer of security. The other consideration about its classification was also addressed by BlackRock CEO Larry Fink, who believes that an Ether-based spot ETF could still be launched even if Ethereum ends up being labeled a security.Contrasting Ethereum's Byzantine fault tolerance with Bitcoin'sThe Web3 software company says Ethereum's Byzantine fault tolerance (BFT) is higher than Bitcoin's. It asserts that Ethereum’s mechanism of penalizing validators who violate protocol rules by slashing their stakes serves as a deterrent against malicious behavior. Additionally, Ethereum's PoS model is more energy-efficient and environmentally friendly than Bitcoin's PoW.Consensys makes a passionate appeal to the regulatory body ahead of the possible approval by stating, “We urge the SEC to recognize the advanced safeguards inherent in Ethereum’s design, which not only meet but exceed the exemplary security and resilience safeguards underlying Bitcoin-based ETPs that have previously been approved by the SEC.”Although the Ethereum ETF is being constantly delayed by the SEC, stakeholders anticipate a decision in the coming months. Regardless, Ethereum continues to gain traction as the second-largest cryptocurrency with a price of $3,502.43.

Hollywood Faces Uncertainty with the Emergence of AI Technology

Minimal encryption is the basis of the exchange, and unlike traditional encryption, it can never be traced back to any particular user. OpenAI, the inventor of ChatGPT, is going one step further by introducing another product called Sora that not only talks but also creates short and simple videos that can be based on a text description. The disruption that comes with efficiency and cost-effectiveness is a plus, but it also forces out business procedures and reduces jobs within the industry.Mixed reactions from industry playersIndustry heavyweights from talent agencies and film studios are beginning to talk to Sora to find out about her skills. The benefits of AI computation are increasingly acknowledged as promising cheaper production and improving the efficiency of ideas. On the other hand, there are concerns that AI affects regular job functions, particularly among the actors, writers, and directors behind the scenes.Artificial intelligence has been growing since there has been a discussion, and some decisions about its effects have been raised in the Hollywood industry. Job loss worries provoked several large strikes by the industrial unions and caused their agreements, which protected workers due to the emergence of new technologies. Nevertheless, the closed-offing of Sora has created questions about the river running of AI in entertainment creation.OpenAI contacts industry specialists for feedback on whether Sora aligns with the industry standards. Given the nature of the technology, it already seems like it will become a popular tool. However, the research is still in the development stage, with several questions falling in place of copyright protection and monetization. To sum up, the film figures, such as director Paul Trillo, believe this is a big opportunity for noticeably different creative logic, and on the other hand, actors like Tyler Perry worry about people losing their jobs.Embracing innovationWhile some people still express skepticism, some in Hollywood recognize that the time to accept AI as part and parcel of filmmaking evolution has arrived. For instance, through CAA and technologies like Vault, digital copies of talents are produced and applied for various marketing purposes. Furthermore, these technologies are starting to surface in domains like auto-encoders in films, voiceovers, and subtitling podcasts, proving an emerging popularity in machine learning technologies.The entertainment industry cannot afford it, leaving AI to evade its use in delivering a quality and less complicated creative process. Filmmakers like Bernie Su use AI tools to effectively bring fresh ideas, showing the technology’s potential to help pad our briefs and switch our brains. AI has proved to be a useful means for overcoming limits while representing a realm of artistic progress in the arena.With growing AI tech advances, the movie industry faces an important moment to ponder how to solve two issues: the promising outcomes of innovation but the potential loss of jobs and creative freedom. OpenAI’s Sora is a major development in this field, setting off many debates on how TV dramas and films should be produced. Although the haziness is in the air, the industry people play a vital role in working actively with AI-influenced solutions, hence acknowledging the difficulties or the opportunities in rebranding the storytelling.Original story from: https://www.maginative.com/article/openai-ceo-sam-altman-discusses-gpt-5-sora-and-the-road-to-agi/#:~:text=Altman%20expressed%20excitement%20about%20Sora’s,operate%20in%20the%20physical%20world

CFTC picks yet another fight with the SEC over KuCoin | Cryptopolitan

Here we go again, folks.It seems like the drama between the United States Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) and the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) just got a new episode, and it’s all about KuCoin this time. Caroline Pham from the CFTC threw the first punch by hinting that their latest move on the crypto exchange KuCoin might just be stepping on the SEC’s toes. Now, if you thought regulatory agencies got along like peas in a pod, this story will set you straight.Let’s dive into the meat of the matter without beating around the bush. The CFTC, known for keeping an eye on commodity derivatives markets, decided to slap KuCoin with a bunch of charges. They’re talking about violations galore under the Commodity Exchange Act (CEA) and CFTC regulations, tagging alongside criminal charges from the U.S. Justice Department. And yes, all of this happened on the same day, March 26, making it a very bad day at the office for KuCoin.A Collision Course with the SEC?Now, Pham from the CFTC isn’t one to mince her words. She pointed out that the CFTC’s recent action might just blur the lines between what’s considered a security and what’s not. According to her, just because you trade derivatives doesn’t mean you own the underlying shares. This distinction is crucial because it’s essentially what separates the CFTC’s playground from the SEC’s.This isn’t just a spat over who gets to regulate what. It’s a fundamental question about how we understand financial instruments and activities. For decades, the U.S. has had a pretty clear divide between securities and commodities. But now, with the rise of cryptocurrencies, things are getting muddy. Ethereum, for example, has become a bone of contention. Is it a commodity, or is it a security? The CFTC seems to think it’s the former, but if the SEC decides it’s the latter, we could see a significant impact on the crypto market, especially regarding spot Ether exchange-traded fund applications.KuCoin Stands Its GroundIn the midst of all this regulatory kerfuffle, KuCoin made it clear that it’s business as usual on their end. Despite the allegations, they assured their users that their assets were safe and sound. They even had the nerve to tweet about finding “100x CryptoGems” on their platform, amidst all the legal drama. Talk about being unfazed.But let’s not forget the serious charges at play here. The co-founders of KuCoin, Chun Gan and Ke Tang, find themselves in hot water with the U.S. SDNY, accused of running an unlicensed money-transmitting business and skirting anti-money laundering laws. The cherry on top? KuCoin’s alleged no-KYC policy, which, according to prosecutors, was key to its growth, enabling over $9 billion of suspicious transactions. It’s like they were saying, “Regulations? Never heard of her.”From around mid-2019 to mid-2023, KuCoin supposedly offered and executed transactions that should have had them checking in with the CFTC. But, according to the charges, they didn’t bother with IP verification to block U.S. users. This oversight (or deliberate ignorance, depending on how you look at it) has now put them squarely in the sights of U.S. regulators.

Nigeria sets $359 million minimum capital mandate for banks | Cryptopolitan

Nigeria just cranked up the heat on its banking sector, big time. The Central Bank of Nigeria has decided it’s time to beef up the financial muscle of its banks. In a country riddled with so many challenges—think rampant inflation, a currency that’s seen better days, and an economy that could use a serious shot in the arm—the CBN’s latest move is like telling banks to hit the financial gym, and not just any gym, but one that requires a huge membership fee. Gone are the days when a bank could operate on the international stage with a mere 50 billion naira. Now, we’re talking a whopping 500 billion naira ($359 million). And for those focusing their operations within Nigeria? A jump from 25 billion to 200 billion naira in capital is no walk in the park. The message is clear: bulk up or risk being left behind. With a 24-month window from April 1 to meet these new thresholds, banks have their work cut out for them.A Move Toward ResilienceThis isn’t about making life hard for banks. Well, not just for the sake of it. It’s about resilience, about making sure these financial institutions can stand tall in the face of economic headwinds. High inflation and a weak economy are no jokes. Add to that a naira that’s taken quite the beating, losing about 70% of its value against the dollar, and you’ve got a situation that calls for some serious fortification. The CBN’s directive for banks to submit an implementation plan by the end of April is the regulatory equivalent of a pep talk, pushing banks to strategize and strengthen their financial standing.For Olayemi Cardoso, the CBN Governor, this move is his opening act. Since taking the reins in September, he’s been vocal about banks beefing up their balance sheets. And let’s not forget, Nigeria is on a mission to revitalize its economy, with reforms aimed at sparking growth. But, as with any major overhaul, there’s been pain. The naira’s plummet and an inflation rate hitting a 28-year peak are testament to the turbulent waters Nigeria is navigating.Banks have felt the squeeze, particularly with the added burden of higher interest rates on dollar loans. This has led to an uptick in impairment charges, a fancy term for banks having to set aside more money to cover bad loans. To cushion against this, the CBN had previously advised banks to stash any foreign-currency gains, a move akin to saving for a rainy day.Stepping Up in a Shifting LandscapeThe banking scene in Nigeria is no stranger to transformation. The last major overhaul in 2004 saw the landscape change dramatically, with mergers and acquisitions reducing the number of commercial banks significantly. This latest mandate could very well spark another wave of consolidation, as banks scramble to meet the new capital requirements.But it’s not just about surviving; it’s about thriving. The CBN’s recent actions, including clearing verified foreign exchange backlogs and tweaking the benchmark interest rate, are aimed at stabilizing the currency and ensuring liquidity in the foreign exchange market. The Nigerian Treasury Bills (NTBs) auction is another piece of this puzzle, with the bank moving significant amounts at varying interest rates to manage liquidity and control inflation.What’s interesting is the naira’s recent performance. Gaining ground in the Autonomous Foreign Exchange market is a sign, according to the CBN’s Corporate Communications Department, that things are moving in the right direction. This uptick is a beacon of hope in a sea of economic challenges, a sign that the CBN’s efforts might just be paying off.Nigeria’s journey is a complex one, with its economic reforms and banking sector fortification acting as critical components. The CBN’s recent mandate is more than just a directive; it’s a statement of intent. Nigeria is pushing its banks to be stronger, more resilient entities capable of supporting growth and weathering economic storms. It’s a tall order, but one that speaks to the broader ambition of steering the country towards a more stable and prosperous future.

AI Revolutionizes April Fools' Day Marketing with a Twist on Tradition

As the principal day rapidly approaches, the marketing arena oozes expectancy and hope alongside the action taken by AI to push technological pranking to the modern level. This is the contemporary take on the April Fools’ Day pranks that have become popular. Impact of AI on April Fools’ marketing evolutionThe pranks go as far as rebranding products. The deliberate and elaborate pranks have created confusion. They could not only put the product or company in a negative light but also give it some unwanted publicity. However, these pranks have historically been light-hearted, sometimes arriving at the fringes of controversy. This has changed with the introduction of AI technologies such as text-to-video generators and chatbots, which has brought confusion and made it hard to differentiate between fun and truth. The Evolution of April Fools’ Marketing: From Tulipomania in the 17th century to the present-day hotbed of large tech firms such as Amazon, Google, and Facebook, Seattle is the focal point for urban technology advances.In the past, small businesses have tried to reach the public with a wide range of April Fools Day pranks, depending on the result. The other way it can be highlighted is through the “Tulipish” translation service by Google Inc. and the Volkswagen stunt of Volkswagen, which have given shape to both the creative possibilities and the pitfalls of such attempts. On the other hand, the picture of phony April Fools’ marketers that used to exist until the introduction of AI most clearly can be noticed by using recent developments in generative AI technology. These tools are equipped with the functionality to generate massive blocks of advertising material fast and cheaply, providing advertisement teams with the power to devise and run many prank ideas before one is finally selected.Balancing creativity with transparency in April Fools’ campaignsAI-powered Aprils Fools nowadays are not only a new way to achieve creativity but also introduce certain problems like the issue of realness and ethical standards. The ease of giving AI the capability to produce even perfectly convincing content has presented issues like deceiving the public. Hence the need for accountability and transparency should be practiced in AI for marketing possession.Questions regarding the ethical dimensions of such a publicity campaign in AI technologies increasingly worry both marketing specialists and ethicists. As we approach AI as a tool that turns the line beyond fact and fiction, we must be careful to avoid pranks that are out of step with professional ethics, and that may cause harm to the public. Experts recommend unambiguous disclosure of AI participation in the media of prank videos to consumers, introducing measures like digital watermarks so that people can identify the sorts of AI-generated images or videos themselves.The future of April Fools’ marketingAs inventors of pranks replace their gags with information about the consequences of their actions, transparency becomes a meaningful concept that includes revelations and the accounting of widespread effect. With the technology and its tricks of imitation thoroughly documented, from voice phone scams to photo and video double, marketing based on advanced technology must be balanced with integrity and honesty. Amongst this, we will carry on our high level of care to not generate unneeded alarms or mix-ups, specifically in the digital environment, where false information can go viral as quickly as a lightning strike.AI is expected to evolve. Therefore, whatever we have known before about AI as a marketing tool has drastically changed up to this moment. The prospect of AI-generating content is a marvel of tomorrow that holds great opportunities for brands that would like to stimulate and captivate viewers and readers using fresh and different methods. The future of AI marketing on April Fools’ Day will be stronger devouring, with the balance of this phenomenon being on the mark of originality and digeness as companies tread the narrow path of absurdity and ethics. The brand can maintain a culture of surprise and delight by preserving all touches of transparency and identifying those supported by artificial intelligence content.Original story from https://cfjctoday.com/2024/03/30/is-this-real-ai-ramps-up-risk-of-april-fools-day-foul-ups-for-corporate-brands/

You Can Earn Real Bitcoin for Playing This Crypto Mining Game-Here's How Much - Decrypt

We’ve covered a lot of mobile games that pay players Bitcoin rewards, but Bitcoin Miner is the most literal interpretation we’ve seen to date: You’re mining fake cryptocurrency in this iOS and Android game, but can cash out real Bitcoin.As Decrypt’s GG recently reported, Bitcoin Miner first launched several years ago without real BTC earnings baked in, and it went nowhere. But once Fumb Games tried implementing the ability to earn and cash out satoshis (the smallest unit of Bitcoin, or 1/100,000,000 BTC), downloads shot through the roof and players kept coming back.And after playing Bitcoin Miner daily for more than a week now, I totally get it. Like all of these games, the amount of Bitcoin you’ll actually earn is incredibly small—and the full-screen video ads that you’ll need to endure along the way can be annoying, particularly when they promote the same couple of scammy looking games over and over again.But unlike a lot of these games, Bitcoin Miner packs personality thanks to its pixel artwork and references to various coins, and it’s an entertaining treat for those of us who live in this oft-ridiculous industry.Screenshots from Bitcoin Miner. Image: Decrypt's GGYou’re not going to make any serious money from this game, but it’s fun to hop into for a few minutes at a time—and you do get some Bitcoin for playing it.Bitcoin Miner is a simple idle “clicker” game that rewards you for repeatedly tapping a button. You’ll begin with a single crypto miner—a little pixel guy sitting at a computer, occasionally generating little pixel coins that scroll over to your piggy bank. As you bank more coins, you can invest in additional levels for your mine and upgrade the speed at which they produce rewards.Before long, you’ll have a multi-tier mine yielding (fake!) bags of Ethereum, Dogecoin, Solana, Shiba Inu, and eventually Bitcoin. Reinvesting your coins into mine upgrades only boosts your earning capabilities, plus you can unlock and equip “managers” for more bonuses, open up additional mines in other regions, and more.There’s not a lot of depth to the gameplay, admittedly, but there’s always another upgrade, boost, or expansion to pour your coins into—and plenty of opportunities to watch those grating video ads to supercharge your earnings or unlock other benefits.Along the way, you’ll also earn real bits of Bitcoin in the form of satoshis that can be cashed out to a ZBD wallet via the Lightning Network. Sometimes satoshis will appear on the screen to tap and claim, while other times they’re hidden around the in-game store or awarded as a daily login reward. Mostly, you’ll earn them through simple gameplay missions that pop up on the screen.It just doesn't add up to a whole lot of Bitcoin to cash out, really. After five hours of play, I amassed 236 satoshis—that’s about $0.16 worth of Bitcoin as of this writing. That’s on par with most of these mobile Bitcoin games, which tend to average out to a few pennies per hour worth of earnings, including Fumb’s own asteroid-mining game, SpaceY.Don’t play Bitcoin Miner because you think you’ll make bank. Play because it’s an amusing riff on the crypto market, and because the numbers always go up in this fake video game economy—unlike in the real crypto market. I’m still playing because I want to see just how wild the faux returns get, even if the real Bitcoin I’m earning is ultimately trivial.Edited by Ryan OzawaStay on top of crypto news, get daily updates in your inbox.

Let's have an honest conversation about adding Bitcoin to your portfolio | Cryptopolitan

So, you’re eyeing Bitcoin, the crypto giant that’s been the talk of the town, shaking up the investment scene like a polaroid picture. Gone are the days when Bitcoin was the shady corner of the financial world; it’s now a guest at the high table, with asset managers giving it the nod as a portfolio diversifier. Why? Because, in this world of investment sameness, Bitcoin stands out like a sore thumb—in a good way.Asset managers aren’t just flirting with the idea; they’re going all in, beefing up their Bitcoin stakes and dabbling in the exotic world of structured products like Accumulators and FCNs. It’s like everyone suddenly found the secret menu at their favorite diner, and now they can’t get enough. The buzz isn’t just limited to crypto nerds; traditional finance bigwigs are getting wide-eyed at the surging demand for Bitcoin ETFs and the likes.Bitcoin’s Roller Coaster Ride to $100,000Let’s talk about the elephant in the room—Bitcoin’s price. Recently, it blew past $70,000, fueled by whispers of the London Stock Exchange getting cozy with Bitcoin and Ethereum through Exchange-Traded Notes. The word on the street is that Bitcoin’s not stopping anytime soon. It’s eyeing that sweet $100,000 mark like a hawk. But let’s be real; Bitcoin’s journey is more unpredictable than trying to guess the next plot twist in your favorite soap opera.However, if the market decides to keep its cool and not throw a tantrum, Bitcoin’s path to glory looks all but assured. The smart cookies at QCP are pitching two hot tips: taking advantage of the juicy yields in the BTC Spot-Forward Basis and hopping on Accumulators to grab Bitcoin at bargain prices. It’s like finding a designer dress at a thrift shop; you just don’t pass up on that.Right now, Bitcoin is flexing with a 5.12% increase in the last 24 hours alone, nearly breaking its own record. It’s not just about the numbers; it’s about the statement it’s making—Bitcoin is here, and it’s not just a fleeting trend.The Debut of Bitcoin ETNs: A Game Changer?Now, let’s shift gears and talk shop about Bitcoin ETNs hitting the London Stock Exchange. This is big news, folks. It’s like Bitcoin just got invited to prom; it’s a legit contender in the finance world now. But these ETNs aren’t your grandma’s investment; they’re like a sleek, new sports car. They don’t give you a piece of the pie like ETFs; they’re more like a promise from the bank to pay up based on how Bitcoin performs. Fancy, right?However, there’s a catch—these shiny new ETNs are playing hard to get, reserved for the “professional investors” only. So, if you’re a regular person, you’ll have to admire from afar. It’s a bold move, gatekeeping the Bitcoin bonanza, but it also adds a layer of seriousness to the whole affair.Across the pond, the Americans are living the Bitcoin dream with regulated products making it easier than ever to jump on the Bitcoin bandwagon, leaving the Brits green with envy. Despite Bitcoin’s impressive somersaults in the market, UK regulators are playing it cool, keeping Bitcoin ETFs at arm’s length and tagging crypto derivatives as too hot to handle for the average investor.But here’s the deal — Bitcoin is shaking off its reputation as a high-risk pariah and stepping up as digital gold. It’s a chameleon, changing its stripes to match the economic backdrop. Sure, it had its moments of doubt, tumbling alongside stocks, but just like a phoenix, it’s back with a vengeance, rallying strong.The big brains at BlackRock are scratching their heads, trying to pin down Bitcoin’s mojo. It’s a puzzle, with Bitcoin dancing to its own beat, sometimes syncing with gold, sometimes doing a solo. What’s clear is that Bitcoin refuses to be pigeonholed, offering a sprinkle of spice to the bland portfolio.

Coinbase, Which Previously Announced Good News For Dogecoin, Bitcoin Cash And Litecoin, Makes Another Surprising Decision For DOGE - Bitcoin Sistemi


The derivatives arm of Coinbase, America's largest cryptocurrency exchange, announced a delay in the launch of futures contracts for Dogecoin (DOGE).
The launch, originally planned for April 1, 2024, was postponed to April 29, 2024. However, futures trading for Litecoin (LTC) and Bitcoin Cash (BCH) will launch as planned on April 1.


Although Dogecoin began as an internet joke, it has reached a significant market cap and has become one of the top cryptocurrencies by market cap at various points over time. “Dogecoin's enduring popularity and active community support show that it has transcended its origins as a joke to become a staple of the cryptocurrency world,” Coinbase said in a recent letter.

The nature of DOGE, LTC, and BCH, which are all based on Bitcoin, may be why Coinbase chose them for futures trading. The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has classified Bitcoin as a commodity, making it difficult to claim these new contracts as securities, especially after the agency's spot BTC exchange-traded funds approvals.





James Seyffart, a cryptocurrency industry expert, expressed his views on the subject. “Honestly, if the SEC had engaged with the industry to set some rules on this, we wouldn't have seen moves like this. But at the same time, my job would have been a lot less interesting,” he said.

Apple to Unveil AI Strategy at WWDC24 in June

Apple, the tech titan, will present its AI strategy this June at the WWDC24 conference- a globally prominent event held annually.Apple’s future demonstration at the WWDC meetings in 2024 is expected to entail its AI strategy, the key point of which is the launch of the next iOS 18 version. It is foreseen that such an exhibition will show how keen and relevant the online retailer is in artificial intelligence, which is regarded as one of the very significant strategic directions of the company.Insights from industry sourcesAs a reliable source reported, AI is one of the keynote issues in the informational perspective of Apple for the WWDC24. Currently, details about the company’s strategy are not available. Still, rumors from insiders show a strong fundamental of the use of AI technologies, which translates into greater integration of AI into the company’s ecosystem.In contrast with glasses, Apple is said not to work exclusively on its own Apple ChatGPT-based business. Instead, the firm refocuses its efforts on establishing partnerships with prominent figures in the industry, such as Google and OpenAI, who are masters in this area of science. This collaborative approach unveils that Apple always finds a route to promote innovation through forming partnerships with partners.Apple’s WWDC24 announcementIn the latest statement recently confirmed, Apple revealed the WWDC24 will take place from June 10th to June 14th. The company was vague about the details of its AI innovations with a subsequent statement regarding its endeavor to present the most recent civilizations, for instance, iOS, iPadOS, macOS, watchOS, tvOS, and visionOS.Apple’s Vice President for Global Developer Relations, Susan Prescott, described her expectation of virtually meeting with developers worldwide throughout the WWDC24. According to her, the event’s objective was to develop ways of forging partnerships, exchanging new ideas, and creating atmospheres, allowing developers to market their innovation in the Apple community.Tim Cook, CEO of Apple, announced the company’s approach towards using AI, which is called generative AI techniques. The Apple Company demonstrated that it is aware of generative AI technologies and has taken steps to use them efficiently. Cook demonstrated that Apple is one of the major players in the AI research and development field, as it is through such investments that the said company endeavors to remain at the top of the AI innovation.Speculations surrounding iPhone AI integrationAn accusation that surfaced recently has created a lot of excitement related to possible cooperation between Apple and Google for integrating the AI engine offered by Google in the iPhone. Similarly, the information OpenAI has given me led me to believe that Apple may be hiring or using its AI model. Hence, Apple’s AI plans are definitely within the scope of people’s discussion.Apple’s V.P. marketing, Greg Joswiak, used digital platform X (formerly Twitter) to incite massive online buzz about using the phrase “Absolute Incredible” to show the initial letters “A” and “I,” which only added to the growing curiosity anticipating Apple’s AI strategy. At the WWDC24, it was finally proven.As the Apple AI strategy release is around the corner at WWDC24, industry players watch and wait for what Apple strategizes about the potential integration of advanced AI features and how they will fit the phalanx of the company’s products. The industry will have center stage later in the show as AI technologies break new ground concerning software and technology developments. This is a fruitful opportunity for Apple to promote its AI initiatives.

‘It’s Going To Do Something Insane This Cycle’ - Analyst Says This Memecoin Primed To Skyrocket by at Least 200% - The Daily Hodl


								A widely followed crypto analyst thinks that a leading meme token is primed to witness big bursts to the upside in the coming months.
The analyst pseudonymously known as Altcoin Sherpa tells his 212,900 followers on the social media platform X that Dogecoin (DOGE) could rally by over 200% from current levels.










“DOGE: this is still a great long-term investment to be honest. And by long term, I mean like six months-plus. It’s going to do something insane this cycle and still should be at least a 3x-plus from here (possibly more). It accumulated for 700 days, still is the banner meme for all of crypto, and is very ‘safe’ given the market cap/liquidity/etc.”
Source: Altcoin Sherpa/X
DOGE is trading at $0.212 at time of writing.
Turning to Bitcoin (BTC), Altcoin Sherpa says that the flagship crypto asset is in a consolidation phase prior to seeing a fresh leg up.
“BTC: price has consolidated here for about one month. Overall, this is bullish and I don’t think we go lower than that range low at $60,000 (in the short term). Expecting a bit more chop and then we do the next leg up. No reason to be bearish at all in my opinion.”
Source: Altcoin Sherpa/X
BTC is trading at $70,068 at time of writing.
Next up is the artificial intelligence-focused crypto project Fetch.ai (FET). Altcoin Sherpa says he is bullish on FET and that pullbacks present potential opportunities for active traders.
“FET: Resume the pump. This is one to buy any dip on if actively trading. I think that it still looks extremely strong.”
Source: Altcoin Sherpa/X
FET is trading at $3.07 at time of writing.

Jerome Powell says interest rate cuts will do nothing for U.S. economy | Cryptopolitan

Jerome Powell, the man in charge of the Federal Reserve, pretty much just told us that cutting interest rates right now is as useful as a screen door on a submarine. Man’s hanging tight, insisting that unless the economic scene shifts big time, rates are staying put. Now, if you were hoping for some wizardry to boost the U.S. economy, Powell’s little speech might feel like a cold shower. I know it does to me.Economic Rollercoaster: The U.S. EditionLet’s get into this a bit further, shall we?U.S. inflation, that sneaky thief, nudged up to 2.5% in February. The number met the forecasts but still managed to inch up from January’s 2.4%. Powell, keeping his cool, admitted that reaching their 2% inflation goal is turning out to be more like herding cats.Despite their best efforts, controlling America’s economy is unbelievably hard. Who’d have thought, huh?Now Powell, at a conference in San Francisco, expressed his frustration towards the bumpy ride his job has been over the past two years. When pressed about the future of inflation, he basically told us we’re all in a wait-and-see game. The Fed’s economists have predicted a rate cut down the road, but let’s not pop the champagne just yet.The current rate is chilling at a 23-year peak, thanks to their aggressive moves last year.And despite the global economy acting like a moody teenager, the U.S. is somehow pulling off some level of exceptionalism. Homegirl’s like that one person at all the frat parties who somehow never ends up with a hangover. This unique position means Powell and his crew can afford to chill for now, taking their sweet time before making any rate cuts. At least that’s what he says.However, this doesn’t mean they’re immune to surprises. Rising petrol costs and shipping kerfuffles, from the Panama to the Suez canals, keep dunking on them harddd.The Complex Web of Inflation and GrowthNot everyone’s convinced we’ll see rate cuts this year, though.Some economists are waving red flags, warning that with inflation potentially sticking around the 2.5% to 3% range, and growth outpacing trends, the Fed’s “mission accomplished” banner is premature. The recent data, a mix of hopeful and daunting, shows that while the core inflation cooled a tad to 2.8%, the overall situation remains heated.Since the U.S. dollar is heavily intertwined with interest rate forecasts, and the stock market takes a breather for Good Friday, we’re left to ponder the Fed’s next move. Do they actually know what they’re doing for real?Stocks have been on a roll, marking the best start since 2019, with the S&P 500 jumping 10.2%. It’s like the market’s got its groove back, but whether this rhythm can last is anyone’s guess to be honest.Meanwhile, latest data from the Commerce Department played out as expected. Core inflation, stripping away the volatile food and energy costs, matched predictions. Consumer spending, outpaced estimates, hinting at potential inflation pressures lurking beneath the surface. But personal income growth was a tad softer.In any case, all eyes are now on whether Jay Pow’s cautious optimism will hold up against the unpredictable currents of global economics and domestic pressures.

Dogecoin (DOGE) Up Against Bigger and More Fierce Competitor Than Shiba Inu (SHIB) in 2024 | Cryptopolitan

Dogecoin (DOGE) finds itself facing formidable competition as it navigates the tumultuous waters of 2024. While it has long been known as the “fun and friendly” coin, DOGE now finds itself up against a more fierce rival than ever before: Shiba Inu (SHIB). But beyond SHIB, there’s another rising project that’s gaining traction and posing a significant challenge to DOGE’s dominance – Retik Finance (RETIK).The Rise of Shiba Inu (SHIB)Shiba Inu (SHIB) burst onto the scene with its meme-inspired branding, quickly gaining popularity among cryptocurrency enthusiasts. With its vibrant community and catchy marketing, SHIB has managed to carve out a niche for itself in the ever-expanding crypto market. However, its rise has not gone unnoticed by other players in the space, including Dogecoin.Dogecoin’s ChallengeDogecoin, once hailed as the “people’s cryptocurrency,” now finds itself facing stiff competition from SHIB. While both coins share similar origins rooted in meme culture, SHIB’s meteoric rise in popularity has posed a significant challenge to DOGE’s market dominance. Investors are now questioning whether Dogecoin can maintain its relevance in the face of such fierce competition.The Emergence of Retik Finance (RETIK)Amidst the battle between DOGE and SHIB, a new project has emerged in the form of Retik Finance (RETIK). Unlike its meme-inspired counterparts, RETIK offers a more sophisticated approach to decentralized finance (DeFi). With innovative features such as virtual DeFi debit cards, AI-powered peer-to-peer lending, and multi-chain non-custodial wallets, RETIK is positioning itself as a serious player in the crypto landscape. Moreover, Retik Finance has secured over $32 million in total funds, showcasing its strong development momentum and active investor engagement.

As Dogecoin, Shiba Inu, and Retik Finance vie for dominance in the crypto market, investors are left wondering which coin will emerge victorious. While Dogecoin has the advantage of being one of the first meme coins and enjoys widespread recognition, Shiba Inu’s rapid ascent and dedicated community pose a formidable challenge. On the other hand, Retik Finance’s focus on innovation and utility sets it apart as a promising contender in the race for dominance. All-in-all, Dogecoin finds itself facing fierce competition from both established players like Shiba Inu and emerging contenders like Retik Finance. While Dogecoin’s status as a meme coin has helped it gain widespread popularity, its future remains uncertain in the face of growing competition. As investors continue to assess the strengths and weaknesses of each coin, only time will tell which cryptocurrency will ultimately emerge as the victor in the battle for dominance.About Retik FinanceRetik Finance (RETIK) is a cutting-edge decentralized finance (DeFi) project revolutionizing global transactions with its innovative suite of financial solutions.

16% Correction Imminent as Bitcoin Stumbles at $70K: Details


							

Michaël van de Poppe projects a $60K target for BTC’s potential correction.



Bitcoin has a resistance wall with $28 billion around the $70,180 price range.



Michaël voiced skepticism about Bitcoin’s potential to soar to $100K soon.




Renowned crypto analyst Michaël van de Poppe has argued that Bitcoin could experience another severe price correction in the coming days. The view comes amid BTC’s momentum stagnation following its re-entry into the $70K region. 



In a recent post on X, Michaël voiced skepticism about Bitcoin’s potential to rocket-launch to $100K soon. He considers the $100K outlook improbable at the moment amid Bitcoin’s resistance barrier.







Specifically, in the chart accompanying the update, Michaël suggested that bearish forces still abound significantly for Bitcoin, especially around the $72K price point. He noted that the asset resists the $72K price level due to the bearish forces.



Analyst Ali Martinez has expressed a similar sentiment about the bearish forces Bitcoin is battling. Citing data from the market intelligence platform IntoTheBlock, Martinez disclosed that BTC’s most significant hurdle is maintaining a close above the $70,180 and $70,600 range. 









IntoTheBlock data indicates that this price point is Bitcoin’s most substantial resistance zone because 292,000 addresses hold 397K Bitcoin within the price range. Put differently, the held token means over $28 billion worth of selling pressure surrounds the $70,180 and $70,600 range. 



Meanwhile, Bitcoin has minimal resistance beyond this range as fewer addresses accumulated BTC between $71,000 and $72,500. As a result, Martinez has suggested that Bitcoin’s triumph over its current resistance wall will send the asset into new unprecedented price levels.



Meanwhile, analyst Michaël van de Poppe believes another correction could be imminent, considering the formidable size of Bitcoin’s resistance wall. Should Bitcoin fail to break above $70,300, he targets a low of around $60,000. This target represents a potential 16% correction should the forecast materialize.



In an earlier analysis of Bitcoin’s current consolidation around $70K, Michaël suggested the asset could be headed for the range of $75K and $80K should it overcome the resistance wall. At press time, Bitcoin hovers around $70,146.

Andrew Tate reveals his Bitcoin DCA strategy


Andrew Tate is one of the most controversial personalities worldwide and a die-hard Bitcoin (BTC) enthusiast. In a recent post on March 29, Tate revealed his Bitcoin dollar-cost averaging (DCA) strategy.
The former kickboxer and current social media influencer commented on X about his recurrent Bitcoin purchases since 2018. Notably, the post had already surpassed 2.5 million views by press time, giving a strong message to cryptocurrency investors.

“I bought my first bitcoin in 2018. Since then, I’ve been buying some bitcoin every single week without fail. And I’ve never, ever, not once – sold ANY. Do you understand?”
– Andrew Tate

How many Bitcoin purchases did Andrew Tate make?
Interestingly, Andrew Tate has allegedly made at least 274 Bitcoin purchases in his life, if he bought BTC “every single week without fail” since 2018.
Finbold got to this number with Claude 3 Opus AI assistance. For that, we calculated the number of weeks from January 1, 2019, to March 30, 2024, resulting in nearly 274 weeks. It is impossible to know how many weeks in 2018 were part of Tate’s DCA strategy with the revealed information.

Andrew Tate and cryptocurrencies
However, this is not the first time the crypto market has hints about the influencer’s investments in cryptocurrencies.
In January 2023, the Romanian police seized millions worth of goods and assets as part of Tate’s criminal investigation. Among these assets, multiple sources report the seizure of 21 BTC, which, Reuters recently reported, are still under police custody.
Previously, The Guardian reported how Andrew Tate told his listeners “that he flipped a $600,000 bitcoin investment from March 2020, turning it into a $12 million profit.” This podcast episode was removed from the content platforms. On that note, it contradicts Tate’s recent sayings that he has never sold any of the purchased Bitcoin.
Additionally, the former kickboxer said, on March 18, this year, that he made $85 million on Pancake’s DeFi ecosystem in 2021’s bull run. This was a few weeks after Andrew Tate slammed crypto traders as the “biggest degenerate losers on the planet.”
What is a DCA strategy?
The Bitcoin dollar-cost averaging strategy lies in the idea that an investor must make recurrent BTC purchases, following a plan. Essentially, these purchases must happen according to the plan, independent of the price Bitcoin is trading at that time.
In particular, Andrew Tate’s self-reported Bitcoin DCA strategy set recurrent weekly purchases, supposedly going on for over five years.
By following this strategy, investors diminish the risk exposure to Bitcoin’s volatility. If the price goes down, they will lower their average cost in dollars, embracing further buying opportunities that surge. On the other hand, if the price goes up Bitcoin DCA investors have guaranteed earlier purchases at lower prices, increasing the ending reward.
Some experts consider the dollar-cost averaging strategy one of the most conservative and secure ways of getting exposure to Bitcoin. Nevertheless, it still has significant risks and results will vary according to the leading cryptocurrency price action.

AI-Generated Influencers Redefine Engagement, Sparking New Trends in Social Media

AI-generated influencers are catching up and taking over, transforming social media by challenging humanized interaction and online content consumption. These virtual personalities (sometimes known as avatars), created and run by innovative tech firms, take on human form. Still, they are no longer just imaginary digital characters but become effective key market role players. AI-powered influencers take center stageThe most significant aspect is recognizing new characters like Agnes, F Inns, and Jade, an ostracized group from the “real” world who have large circles on the Internet through their entertaining virtual characters. Companies like 1337 have been some of the early leaders in digital influencer creation, and often, such startups involve some teenagers hired for that purpose. These specialists handle various tasks, from content production to overall management of virtual entities. This collaborative, ongoing process of AI operations, in conjunction with human creativity exhibits a one of a kind combination of technology and personal touch, thus resulting in AI-created content remaining interesting and acceptable to their human followers.The 1337s’ strategy is all about detailed planning: it starts with creating the characters’ back-stories, hobbies, and lifestyles corresponding to (or being their) own. This level of precision also extends to content moderation by humanized creators who refine and approve contributions made by artificial intelligence image and post generators so that they can be made most faithful to the virtual influencer’s authentic identity. AI influencers balancing innovation with ethical concerns in the digital eracollaboration highlights that AI is positioned to be extended to all levels of the virtual influencer genre, boosting the credibility and charm that comes with it. Additionally, the appearance of AI influencers allows for the starring of new means of creativity and marketing strategies. On the other hand, it also puts forward controversial issues about what stands behind the lie and how it can be tolerated. While some discordant voices place their trust in AI and illustrate things it can do just as well as real people, others are concerned regarding the lack of transparency in telling whether certain content is created by artificial intelligence or by real people. These influencers have the potential to steer their audience towards doing something malicious, like spreading fake news or exploiting citizens through their ‘AI’ content, which has led to calls for stricter regulation and clear labeling of ‘AI’ content.Embracing the Future of AI InfluencersConsequently, social networks like TikTok and Meta have introduced the labeling of AI-derived content as a procedure. They are trying to increase transparency and conscious consumption among the platform’s users with the help of these labels. Through this identification of particular producers of artificial content, there is an important shift in addressing ethical problems. However, how it will impact user participation and AI influencer’s general acceptance rate remains undetermined.With the digital human market growth predicted to exceed $125 billion by 2035, it is reasonable to assume that the involvement of artificial intelligence (AI)–driven influencers will experience a big expanse. This development shows a tendency for our reality to be enveloped in data of virtual social media and thus dividing the lines between our real and online social possessors, where we all have opportunities and challenges in this tech era for content creators, marketers, and consumers.The increasing presence of AI as social media influencers engenders a novel, radical phase in media’s evolution. This phase vividly illustrates innovative methods of communal interaction and the necessity for revising the code of ethics in the digital sphere. Amidst tough waters of unknowns, balancing the use of AI and retaining the reality of social interaction online is incredibly important for the future of social media to be productive for all.Original story from  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VFd9dsgYt9w

Newly Launched Memecoin Reaches $300 Million Market Cap in One Day, Brings Record on Base - Bitcoin Sistemi


cc0 NFT mfers NFT collection founder Sartoshi launched a memecoin called mfercoin on the Base network early this morning. The new coin was distributed as an airdrop to mfer NFT owners.
Mfercoin's market capitalization has already exceeded $300 million and transaction volume exceeded $76 million. The base price of the mfer NFT has increased significantly by over 60% in the last 24 hours, reaching over 0.6 ETH.


However, the memecoin in question lacks any use case or intrinsic value, and its price rises and falls based entirely on speculation. In addition, since it is released by an anonymous developer, there is also the possibility of rugpull fraud. Therefore, as with all other memecoins, it is better to be careful.

As we approach the end of March, activity on Base, the layer two blockchain developed by cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase, remains strong, with daily transactions and trading volumes rising to record levels. Base reached an all-time high on March 29, recording 2.27 million transactions, driven by the new memecoin.





This increase in daily activity comes after weekly transactions on Base reached an all-time high, with approximately 9.59 million transactions recorded on March 18.
Base's weekly network revenue also set a new record on March 18.

According to on-chain data, a substantial amount of 16 million XRP has been transferred from Upbit, one of South Korea's largest cryptocurrency exchanges, to an unknown wallet. The movement of a large amount of XRP from Upbit to an unknown wallet has led to speculation within the cryptocurrency community about the possibility of a whale buying XRP.The transfer was detected and reported by Whale Alert, a service that tracks large cryptocurrency transactions: "16,000,000 XRP worth $10,027,185 was transferred from Upbit to unknown wallet." In a similar move, another massive transaction of 18 million XRP was moved from Upbit to an unknown wallet. Whale Alert reports that: "18,000,000 XRP worth $11,265,675 transferred from Upbit to unknown wallet."Such large-scale transfers often lead to speculation about the intentions behind them. In both cases, the unknown destination of the XRP moves might suggest that whales, or large holders of cryptocurrency, could be accumulating a position.This is further supported by the recent movements of XRP to unknown destinations: As reported, 210 million XRP coins were shifted between unknown wallets.The recent moves might indicate that large players or whales are accumulating XRP in anticipation of positive developments, potential price movements, or as part of a longer-term investment strategy.The timing of these transactions also coincides with rumors of a potential settlement between Ripple and the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).There is ongoing settlement chatter as the entire XRP community speculates on a potential "settlement conference." Fox Business correspondent Eleanor Terrett hints at a "settlement conference" scheduled for March 29, citing Court Listener documents.If the speculations are true, such a settlement could have significant repercussions for the value of XRP and the broader cryptocurrency market.

‘We Won't Need Sara’: Actress Learns She’s Been Replaced by AI - Decrypt

Stage and voice actress Sara Poyzer was unceremoniously informed that she had been replaced by artificial intelligence, the Mamma Mia star said Tuesday.Poyzer posted the text of an email message she received from an unnamed production company that said her voice services were no longer needed by the BBC as the broadcaster had given permission to use an AI-generated voice instead.“Sorry for the delay,” the message said. “We have had the approval from [the] BBC to use the AI-generated voice so we won’t need Sara anymore.”“Sobering,” she commented with a sad face emoji. She tagged the Twitter accounts for the BBC Arts channel and Equity, the UK trade union representing professional performers and other creative workers.Fans and fellow actors responded to Poyzer’s plight with a mix of sympathy and anger.“It’s happened with myself and art projects many times now,” artist and media personality Nathan Wyburn responded on Twitter. “Sorry this has happened to you!”“This is absolutely awful,” composer Rob Lord added. “Something needs to be done about this ASAP starting with them hiring you for this job!”Representatives for Poyzer did not immediately respond to Decrypt’s request for comment. For its part, the BBC confirmed to Deadline that it would be using AI to narrate a ”highly sensitive documentary” for which a contributor “is nearing the end of life and is now unable to speak.”It doesn't appear that Poyzer is the contributor in question, and it's unclear why her voice talents were initially sought.“We have been working closely with their family to explore how we might best represent the contributor’s voice at the end of the film when words they have written are read out,” the BBC statement continued. “In these very particular circumstances and with the family’s wishes in mind, we have agreed to use AI for a brief section to recreate a voice which can no longer be heard.”The broadcaster said the use of AI would be prominently disclosed when it appears in the film.This controversy is not new for the BBC, which acknowleeged on Tuesday that it had used generative AI to create marketing images for the new season of Doctor Who."We followed all BBC editorial compliance processes, and the final text was verified and signed off by a member of the marketing team before it was sent," a statement from the BBC read, adding, "We have no plans to do this again to promote Doctor Who."Despite the BBC’s contrition over the use of AI in Doctor Who, the network has not changed its overal stance on the use of generative AI—inaction decried by voice talent agency Voice Squad, which represents Poyzer.“We were very disappointed to receive the production company’s response, particularly as it’s a BBC project,” Voice Squad told the Daily Mail. “The BBC have always stood for quality in their factual and drama broadcasting.“As a voiceover agency, we feel that AI is a danger to the whole industry, removing work from artists who have trained for three years at drama school and spent many years honing their craft,” the company added.The use of artificial intelligence to replace human talent was one of the key sticking points of the months-long WGA and SAG-AFTRA strikes last year after the technology advanced and spread rapidly following the release of the public version of ChatGPT by OpenAI in late 2022.Fast forward to 2024, and AI has been widely tapped to create AI-generated images, music, video, and audio. AI tools like Runway, Murf, and OpenAI’s Sora have revolutionized content creation. It has become easier to use technology to create hours works that used to take humans days or weeks to create, whether scripts, books, songs, images, or videos.Yesterday, Open AI published examples of voice cloning enabled by its new Voice Engine, which needs only 15 seconds of recorded speech to generate a convincing copy.Edited by Ryan Ozawa.Stay on top of crypto news, get daily updates in your inbox.

How the UK is quite literally ruining Scotland's economy | Cryptopolitan

Right now, Scotland is standing at a crossroads, facing a future tethered to the UK’s economic misadventures or charting its own path towards prosperity akin to that of similarly sized independent European countries. A look around reveals a startling reality. Nations of Scotland’s size are thriving, making a mockery of the economic turmoil gripping larger entities like the UK. A Glimpse at What Could BeRecent revelations have shed light on the economic superiority of smaller, advanced European nations over the UK, casting a shadow over Scotland’s ties to its larger neighbor. Countries such as the Scandinavian nations, Ireland, and Austria boast not only a higher GDP per capita but also exhibit a resilience that the UK seems to have lost somewhere along the way. It’s not just about the numbers; it’s about the quality of life, with these nations outperforming the UK in productivity, business investment, and poverty reduction.Scotland, with its devolved government, has shown that it’s not afraid to go against the grain of Westminster’s conventional wisdom. By introducing progressive tax reforms and educational policies, and by leveraging its limited social security powers to support children and families more effectively than the broader UK welfare system, Scotland has charted a course towards a more inclusive and prosperous society.Yet, the stark contrast in living standards across the UK, exacerbated by Brexit and other economic missteps, paints a grim picture for Scotland’s future within this union. The economic stagnation of the UK, referred to as “Rishi’s recession,” further underscores the urgency for Scotland to reconsider its economic alliances. With the UK economy barely limping forward, comparisons with the dynamic economies of independent nations similar in size to Scotland reveal a chasm that is widening with each passing year.Independence: A Road to Redemption or Ruin?As Scotland reflects on a quarter-century of devolution and a decade since the independence referendum, the question looms larger than ever: to stay or to go? The evidence suggests that the UK’s economic strategies, particularly post-Brexit, are not just failing Scotland but dragging it down. With Westminster locked in a policy paralysis, seemingly incapable of addressing the economic challenges head-on, Scotland’s aspirations for a better future seem increasingly at odds with the trajectory of the UK.The choice facing Scotland is stark. On one hand, there’s the familiarity of the status quo, with its diminishing returns and growing inequalities. On the other, the allure of independence offers a beacon of hope, promising a future where Scotland can embrace the economic models that have served its European peers so well.Brexit has only widened the policy chasm between Scotland and the UK, with Scotland’s overwhelming opposition to leaving the EU juxtaposed against the UK’s contentious divorce from the bloc. The migration debate further highlights the divergent paths, as Scotland seeks to welcome more people to counteract its population challenges, in stark contrast to the UK’s tightening immigration policies.As Scotland ponders its future, the economic narrative unfolding in the UK serves as a cautionary tale. With Britain’s economy stumbling into a shallow recession and showing signs of a sluggish recovery, the prognosis for the UK’s economic health under Prime Minister Rishi Sunak’s stewardship is far from reassuring. Despite optimistic projections for a rebound, the reality remains bleak, with the UK lagging behind its G7 peers in post-pandemic recovery.

Here’s why you should watch this 3 crypto this week


In the past seven days, the cryptocurrency market, predominantly led by Bitcoin (BTC), has primarily maintained a consolidated stance as investors await any significant breakout. Overall, the market remains on the edge, anticipating a sustained bullish run, particularly with the impending Bitcoin halving event awaited for April. 
Notably, a few cryptocurrencies have captured attention, largely owing to their distinct underlying fundamentals. Against this backdrop, the following three cryptocurrencies warrant close observation from investors this week.
Dogecoin (DOGE)
Dogecoin (DOGE) investors anticipate another week of possible bullish sentiments to propel its price surge. It is worth noting that recent on-chain metrics and community discussions point to potential advancements in the token’s valuation, particularly with significant interest in its integration with X (formerly Twitter) for crypto payments.


Fueling speculations, prominent Dogecoin developer “Mishaboar” sparked conversations about integrating DOGE into X’s payment system. Since Elon Musk acquired the social media platform, discussions regarding DOGE’s incorporation have flourished. While the timeline remains uncertain, Mishaboar, in an X post on March 28, hinted at potential collaborations with exchanges or brokerage platforms to facilitate seamless integration.
At the same time, on-chain analysis indicates a surge in the DOGE transaction count, signaling heightened investor activity and a growing demand for the meme coin. Data from crypto analysis platform Santiment indicates transactions skyrocketing from 1.22 billion to 9.20 billion DOGE within a mere 48 hours as of March 27.

However, amid the excitement, attention remains on whether DOGE can sustain its recent price gains, with the token having reached one of its highest levels since December 2021, and investors are closely monitoring its ability to maintain this momentum.
As of press time, DOGE was trading at $0.21, with daily losses of about 2.5%. Nonetheless, over the past seven days, the token has surged by almost 30%.

XRP 
XRP braces for a pivotal week driven by both on-chain metrics and regulatory dynamics that could significantly impact its valuation. Despite the broader market trends, XRP has notably failed to keep pace, remaining in a consolidated phase below the $0.70 mark.
Investor attention zeroes in on XRP this week as its parent company, Ripple, gears up to unlock 1 billion tokens on April 1. This routine sell-off, part of Ripple’s monthly schedule since 2017, raises concerns about potential downward pressure on XRP’s price in the near term.
Adding to the uncertainty is the shift in token release methodology, with Ripple employing different accounts for this month’s unlocking. This move amplifies existing questions about XRP’s price trajectory and its impact on the ongoing consolidation phase.
Furthermore, notable activity has been observed on the network, particularly in terms of whale transactions. A recent transfer of 210 million XRP between unknown whale wallets, valued at $128.9 million, has fueled speculation, further heightening anticipation regarding XRP’s movement.
In tandem with these developments, Ripple continues its legal battle with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), which seeks hefty penalties against the company. 
Allegations of conducting unregistered XRP offerings have led to a proposed penalty of $1.95 billion. Ripple’s CEO, Brad Garlinghouse, and Chief Legal Officer, Stuart Alderoty, have strongly criticized the SEC’s actions, signaling that any developments in the case could sway XRP’s price.
As of press time, XRP was trading at $0.62, marking slight weekly gains of just above 1%.

Cardano (ADA)
Cardano (ADA) has asserted its prominence in the cryptocurrency market with sustained network development aimed at establishing itself as a formidable competitor to entities like Ethereum (ETH). Spearheaded by IOHK, recent updates underscore significant progress across various aspects of the platform.
Notably, data released for the week ending March 29 revealed substantial efforts towards integrating the latest node release, v.8.10.0-pre, into SanchoNet for governance testing. Additionally, the ledger team has advanced in enhancing test frameworks and data quality, reinforcing Cardano’s pursuit of stability and reliability.
The platform’s expanding ecosystem is evident through notable project metrics, including 163 projects launched, 6,449 smart contracts deployed, and a remarkable 88.1 million transactions recorded by the week ending March 29.

This week, all eyes are on ADA’s potential to approach the $1 mark. The network’s activity serves as a critical factor in propelling the token towards this milestone, with its ability to sustain prices above the $0.6 support level being closely monitored.
As of press time, ADA was trading at $0.65, boasting weekly gains of over 4%, signaling growing investor confidence in Cardano’s trajectory.

Binance executives sue Nigeria - What's the plan here? | Cryptopolitan

It seems like the drama between Binance and the Nigerian government just took a turn into the courtroom. When two top dogs from the world’s biggest crypto playground landed in Nigeria this February, they weren’t expecting a VIP tour of the local legal system. Yet, here we are, Tigran Gambaryan and Nadeem Anjarwalla, two high-fliers at Binance, find themselves caught in a legal tangle, suing some pretty heavy hitters in Nigeria for what they claim is a blatant disrespect of their basic human rights. The Heart of the MatterAfter touching down in Nigeria, Gambaryan and Anjarwalla were looking forward to talks with officials about Binance’s operations. Instead, they got a firsthand experience of Nigerian hospitality, legal style. Charged with tax evasion among other accusations, these execs weren’t just invited for tea; they were detained, sparking an international eyebrow raise. The situation escalated quickly with Anjarwalla’s movie-style escape following a prayer session, while Gambaryan stayed put to fight the legal battle. Their demands? Simple: let us out, give us back our passports, and say you’re sorry. Not too much to ask, right?Central to the drama is Nigeria’s claim that Binance was playing fast and loose with billions in naira, stirring up currency exchange rates like a bartender on a Friday night. Not a good look for stability, according to Olayemi Cardoso, the country’s central bank governor. Meanwhile, the Nigerian authorities’ chairs at the court hearing were as empty as a scammer’s conscience, leading to an adjournment till early April.The Bigger PictureBut let’s zoom out for a sec. The sudden exit of Binance from Nigeria wasn’t just about legal scuffles; it’s a snapshot of a larger battlefield – the Global South’s fight for financial autonomy and the struggle to play in the global sandbox without getting sand kicked in their face. The departure of a crypto giant like Binance from one of the most vibrant bitcoin markets on the globe sends ripples far beyond the shores of Nigeria. It’s a blow to entrepreneurs dreaming of scaling their ventures beyond borders, highlighting the chokehold of regulatory and financial barriers.For folks in the Global South, it’s not just about trading bitcoin. It’s about breaking free from economic shackles, tapping into global markets, and proving that their money’s as good as anyone else’s. Binance’s exit is a wakeup call, underscoring the need for a financial system that doesn’t just cater to the big fish but throws a lifeline to the small fry too.The clash between Binance and Nigerian authorities is more than a legal drama; it’s a stark reminder of the ongoing currency war, where the right to decide which money holds value is fiercely contested. It’s about creating a level playing field where entrepreneurs from the Global South can thrive without being bogged down by bureaucratic quicksand.Despite Binance waving goodbye to Nigeria, the crypto landscape is still teeming with opportunities. The battlefield might be riddled with obstacles, but the potential for growth and innovation on the world’s fastest-growing continent is as vast as the Sahara.So, what’s the plan here? For Binance, it’s about clearing their name and getting back to business. But on a grander scale, it’s about pushing forward in the face of adversity, championing the cause of financial freedom and innovation in the face of stiff opposition.

Why is Russia so obsessed with the Chinese yuan? - Does it even make sense? | Cryptopolitan

Ever wondered why Russia seems to be head over heels for the Chinese yuan? Well, pull up a chair, because we’re diving deep into this fixation. Let’s be clear from the start: Russia’s enthusiasm for the yuan isn’t a fleeting crush; it’s a strategic move born out of necessity and a touch of desperation. The Financial TightropeRussia’s been walking a financial tightrope lately, thanks to its ongoing conflict in Ukraine. This situation has left the country in a bit of a pickle, with its international assets getting the cold shoulder from the global community. Imagine having a wallet full of cash that no one will accept – that’s pretty much the bind Russia finds itself in.In its annual financial heart-to-heart, Russia’s central bank spilled the beans. The gist? The Chinese yuan is basically the only friend Russia has left in its currency clique. The bank lamented the lack of viable alternatives, pointing out that currencies from other “friendly” countries are about as stable as a house of cards in a wind tunnel. Low liquidity, high volatility, and capital movement restrictions make them about as appealing as a lead balloon.Meanwhile, China’s standing in Russia’s economic circle has been getting rosier by the day. As sanctions from the West rain down, Russia’s been tilting its economic compass towards Asia, with China being the belle of the ball. This shift isn’t just about keeping the lights on; it’s a fundamental reorientation of Russia’s trade and financial strategy.Interestingly, the yuan has swaggered its way to the top, dethroning the US dollar as Russia’s currency MVP. Before the tanks started rolling, the yuan was barely a blip on Russia’s financial radar. Fast forward to today, and it’s the star of the show.A Golden Lining in a Cloudy SkyRussia’s financial woes aren’t just about currency politics; there’s a bigger picture involving the country’s piggy bank, officially known as the National Wellbeing Fund (NWF). This fund, which took years to fatten up, has been on a diet since the conflict began, shrinking faster than a snowman in a sauna.As sanctions bite and the economic screws tighten, Russia’s been dipping into this fund to keep the economy from hitting rock bottom. But here’s the kicker: a big chunk of this fund is tied up in assets that are as liquid as a block of concrete. That means they can’t be easily converted to cash when the going gets tough. Economists are ringing alarm bells, warning that the fund’s once-impressive size is now more of an illusion, with only a fraction available for rainy days.The situation is precarious. With oil prices playing hide and seek, the NWF’s cushion is thinning out. Russia’s finance minister has hinted at other budget-balancing acts if the fund’s reserves start to resemble a drought-stricken riverbed. But let’s not sugarcoat it: if oil prices take a nosedive, Russia could be staring down the barrel of a very empty financial shotgun.So, back to our original question: Why the fixation with the Chinese yuan? For Russia, it’s a matter of survival. With traditional financial avenues blocked and the West turning its back, the yuan offers a lifeline, a way to keep the economy afloat amid a sea of sanctions and geopolitical isolation.Does it make sense? Absolutely. In the chess game of international finance, Russia is making calculated moves to safeguard its economy.And so there you have it.

BlackRock CEO Shocked by Explosive Growth of Bitcoin ETFs Amid Overseeing $10T - Coin Edition


							

Larry Fink has expressed surprise at the remarkable surge in Bitcoin spot ETFs.



BlackRock ETF attracted $10 billion within its initial weeks and now boasts $17 billion in assets.



The figure places IBIT in close competition with Grayscale’s GBTC, which currently holds $23 billion in assets.




In a recent interview on FOX Business, BlackRock CEO Larry Fink expressed astonishment at the remarkable surge in Bitcoin spot exchange-traded funds (ETFs), particularly those managed by his firm. With BlackRock overseeing $10 trillion, Fink’s admission of surprise underscores the unprecedented feat of Bitcoin’s ascent in the U.S. crypto ETF market.



“I am very bullish on the long-term viability of Bitcoin,” Fink declared, acknowledging the cryptocurrency’s recent milestone of hitting a record-breaking high of $72,850. Reflecting on the market’s rapid growth, he remarked:




That surprised me how much that’s gone up… I’m pleasantly surprised. And I would never have predicted it before we filed it.




BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust ETF, trading as IBIT, attracted a staggering $10 billion in its initial weeks and now boasts $17 billion in assets. This figure puts IBIT in close competition with Grayscale’s Bitcoin Trust, which currently holds $23 billion in assets. Fink proclaimed IBIT as “the fastest-growing ETF in the history of ETFs.” 



Notably, the surge in Bitcoin-based investment funds comes after the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission approved the first-ever crypto spot ETFs in January. The move has democratized Bitcoin investment access for institutional and retail investors.









The allure of Bitcoin ETFs has propelled significant gains for the cryptocurrency, outperforming traditional assets. For instance, BTC outperformed the S&P 500 with a remarkable 54% surge this year alone. 



Moreover, a report from FOX suggested that the influx of capital into Bitcoin ETFs is rivaling the demand for gold, historically considered one of the safest assets. Wells Fargo Institute’s John LaForge and Mason Mendez observed that the U.S. Bitcoin spot ETFs attracted $30.6 billion within a few weeks compared to the five years it took spot-based gold ETFs.

Binance Clamps Down: A New Strategy To Exclude US Traders Unveiled


								A recent report from Bloomberg has shed light on Binance’s latest efforts to refine its client base. It enhanced the screening process for prime brokerage clients to exclude US-based investors from its platform.
This move comes amidst increasing regulatory demands and the exchange’s endeavors to fortify its compliance framework.

Binance Intensifies Screening To Exclude US Investors
According to the report, Binance’s initiative to engage prime brokers such as FalconX and Hidden Road in this enhanced screening process underscores the exchange’s commitment to adhering to regulatory standards.
The directive to these prime brokers, who predominantly serve institutional investors, includes rigorous checks on the geographical locations of their client’s offices, founders, and employees.
This approach to client screening is part of Binance’s broader strategy to ensure that US investors are not served in line with regulatory expectations.
Meanwhile, as Binance navigates the complex regulatory environment, it has implemented stricter measures beyond client screening. Notably, the exchange has recently introduced more stringent requirements for listing new digital tokens.
As reported, this initiative aims to improve investor protection against fraudulent activities, such as “rug pulls,” and enhance oversight of token listings.
These measures include extending the “cliff period” during which tokens cannot be sold, mandating increased allocation of coins to market makers, and instituting security deposits.
Navigating Global Regulatory Challenges
While Binance’s efforts to strengthen its compliance framework in the US are notable, the exchange also faces regulatory headwinds in other jurisdictions.
In Nigeria, for example, the government has raised serious concerns, accusing the exchange of facilitating transactions that they allege have negatively impacted the national currency, the naira. This has placed Binance under the spotlight, leading to heightened scrutiny from Nigerian regulators.
The situation escalated, and the Nigerian authorities took decisive action against Binance’s operations within their borders. Two executives from Binance, Tigran Gambaryan and Nadeem Anjarwalla, were detained in a government facility starting February 26, closely monitored by the Nigerian National Security Agency.
This move by the Nigerian government underscores the growing tension between Binance and regulatory bodies in its operating countries, spotlighting the broader challenges crypto exchanges face in maintaining compliance across diverse regulatory environments.
In addition to the detention of its executives, the Nigerian government has pressed the exchange to provide extensive transactional data on its top 100 users within the country.
Despite regulatory turbulence, the exchange native token, BNB, has sustained its trading value above the $500 mark. Despite a 6.1% dip in its price over the last 24 hours, BNB currently maintains its position, trading at $516 at the time of writing.

Crypto is totally a Lego financial system - and that's a good thing - Blockworks


There’s been a lot of bad in crypto over the last few years. 
FTX in particular — but also Three Arrows Capital, Terra, Celsius and many, many others. However, there’s also been promising developments for the cryptocurrency pragmatists. And pragmatism is a word, in general, not attached to crypto when it comes to mainstream thinking. 
Take, for example, a recent Financial Times article, written ahead of former FTX CEO and crypto shyster Sam Bankman-Fried’s sentencing. This hot take sums it up best: 
“But what is our verdict on crypto? Have we learnt the lessons from the disastrous 2022 crash in digital assets? To judge from recent action in the crypto market, the answer appears to be no.”
While there are good points to the article, I disagree with this. There is very real antifragility in the cryptocurrency ecosystem — even in the face of an undaunting amount of bad actors. This is why, in part, the market has returned in 2024. 
Crypto’s antifragility is due to its interconnected, but never locked in, building blocks. This concept can be easily conveyed with toy bricks — Legos — in this new world of financial “composability.” This concept means the future of finance will be increasingly “composed” of many building blocks rather than being centralized. 
Think of this similar to Lego bricks — built on a foundation of consensus, blockchain, cryptocurrency and smart contracts. 
Breaking down the blocks
Various building blocks comprise the crypto world. Each piece is of its own and used to build bigger things. These can be taken apart as well, but it doesn’t mean a few blocks can’t fail or disappear. 
This is exactly why Bitcoin was proposed by Satoshi Nakamoto well over a decade ago. It was in response to the very centralized financial system that blew up catastrophically back in 2008, the impetus for the Great Recession.
It’s important to keep in mind that the FT piece focuses on centralized, non-transparent actors like FTX. No focus is on any of the novel technological aspects of the crypto ecosystem — decentralized components that work together to create a system that, since the advent of Bitcoin, has worked well. 
I’m not surprised, however, that many do not realize that crypto’s perceived centralization in light of FTX doesn’t reflect reality. A good way to think about this concept can be from a foundational building block approach:
Consensus is the way that each crypto network can secure its network in a decentralized manner. As examples, Bitcoin uses proof-of-work mining, Ethereum uses proof-of-stake and Iota uses a Direct Acyclic Graph (DAG) based consensus. The FT article mentions “consensus” only once, and in the context of identifying it as an “esoteric subject.” It’s hardly that, and one of the most important foundational concepts to grasp, especially when thinking about crypto’s decentralization. 
Blockchain enables a transparent record that requires no third party to verify. This can be public, like Litecoin’s blockchain. Or, it can be private, like HyperLedger’s Fabric. Hybrid models also exist, combining the best of a private and public blockchain. But the fact that blockchains can be separated from crypto is something important that the FT article dismisses entirely.
Cryptocurrencies are digital assets that are secured by cryptography. These digital assets are almost always built and created on top of a blockchain for transparency, but some of them are privatized like Monero. I won’t deny that there’s been a lot of stigmatism of privacy coins, but regulators have made measured moves to find ways to clamp down on this without affecting transparent cryptocurrencies. 
Smart contracts are programmable agreements for the automation of money and assets. Take, for example, the vending machine concept of the ICO token fundraising model. An investor sends a digital asset, like ether (ETH) on Ethereum, to a smart contract in return for another asset. The FT article is right, the majority of crypto transactions are stablecoins, but that disregards the importance of smart contracts and how they’re creating a new financial system that’s genuinely different from the old.
How the pieces fit
After the foundational technologies — consensus, blockchain, cryptocurrency and smart contracts — the bricks can fit in many ways within crypto infrastructure. It just depends on how developers want to build with these foundational Lego blocks. 
Take NFTs. On Ethereum, non-fungible tokens are a special type of cryptocurrency that require the use of a foundational blockchain and a smart contract. On Bitcoin, Ordinal NFTs use the smallest unit of BTC, a satoshi, a foundational blockchain and the order of satoshis from consensus proof-of-work mining. 
Another example: Ethereum’s switch from proof-of-work to proof-of-stake consensus — while certainly not an easy task — is a case of swapping out the foundational blocks. 
Any way that crypto infrastructure is built uses those foundational, sovereign building blocks to holistically create something that is resistant to failure — the very reason why centralized bad actors like SBF can’t take the whole system down with their complete and total narcissistic tendencies. This is because each building block is independent and of its own volition. The bricks are interconnected, but are also independent technologies.
In the end
Many people only see scams, hacks and fraud in the crypto world. And there’s no denying there are fraudulent and untruthful actors swimming around in this space. But crypto’s building blocks — the Legos — keep the system running unflappably. 
The industry did experience a crypto winter in 2022 and 2023. And a thaw is occurring now for a very good reason. Did any of the major foundational technologies — consensus, blockchain, cryptocurrency or smart contracts — stop working for technical reasons during this time? 
No. 
When Terra fell, did other stablecoins survive? When Three Arrows Capital collapsed, did the market cease to exist? When FTX imploded, were crypto transactions still flowing in and out of other exchanges? 
The answer for each is a resounding YES.
Terrible actors are indeed a problem. But those people didn’t stop the core tech of the crypto ecosystem to stop working. 
Charlatans will come and go, but the building blocks of this industry — the Legos — will remain.

Dogecoin's (DOGE) price is undergoing a major cool-off after printing a bearish close on March 29 on the daily chart. This drawdown comes after the meme coin recorded a massive upsurge of 28% in the trailing seven-day period. At the time of writing, Dogecoin is down by 1.33% in the past 24 hours to $0.211.Though the parabolic 28% surge of the past week has hit a brick wall at this time, the price and network growth trend of DOGE for the better part of the month showcases what to expect in both the short and long term. Dogecoin started the month on a bullish note with a price of $0.1164. From March 1 through March 4, the coin recorded successive green daily candles but suffered a steep correction on March 5.This correction extended until March 19, from which a bullish reversal was recorded. At this point, the price jumped from $0.12368 to a monthly high of $0.22847 as of March 27. This erratic movement shows that the price of Dogecoin is dynamic and might wriggle out of the current drawdown.The daily charts show an ongoing bull-bear war, one that might be decided by the broader trend in the industry.Dogecoin stiff resistance to watchBesides the general market outlook and whale actions, data from the crypto analytics platform IntoTheBlock (ITB) has showcased the major resistance point for the DOGE price.With the 88.98% jump in the addresses in profit coming in at 5.52 million addresses, the data posits that a total of 6.47 billion DOGE serves as a barrier to watch.Dogecoin I/O Money Chart.

Bitcoin Cash’s Easter comeback amid impressive price surge


Bitcoin Cash (BCH) remarkably resurges on Easter Eve and is back to the top 15 most valuable cryptocurrencies by capitalization. BCH has added nearly $3 billion to its market cap in a week and doubled its price in a month.
The old-guard cryptocurrency has made an impressive comeback and reconquered the 14th rank in the CoinMarketCap index this Eater’s week. Now, Bitcoin Cash sits between Polkadot (DOT), in the 13th, and Chainlink (LINK) in the 15th position.
Notably, BCH has seen gains of nearly 30% and 95% in the last 7- and 30-day period, respectively. As of writing, Bitcoin Cash trades at $602.76 and has a $11.86 billion market cap.


Over $33.43 billion of BCH changed hands in a month, adding nearly $3 billion in capitalization in the meantime.

BCH price analysis: Why is Bitcoin Cash pumping?
As usual, multiple factors are in play for BCH’s weekly and monthly pumps. From community developments, news, technical analysis, and economic fundamentals, here is the context of March’s surge.
Bitcoin Cash resurgence amid new book launch
Interestingly, Bitcoin Cash’s Easter resurgence happened following the “Hijacking Bitcoin: The Hidden History of BTC” book launch. Steve Patterson wrote this documentary piece in collaboration with the Bitcoin legend, Roger Ver, also known as the “Bitcoin Jesus.”
In particular, Roger Ver recently appeared in an interview with Vlad Costa on the Bitcoin Takeover podcast. As reported by Finbold, the legendary Bitcoin early adopter and investor doubled down on his support of BCH.

VIDEO

Moreover, Ver talked about “disgusting tactics” used by Bitcoin (BTC) supporters during the block-size wars in 2017. A history that he tells in the new book and believes is of huge importance for cryptocurrency investors who did not live in these controversial times.
Bitcoin SV (BSV) supporters migrating to BCH
From another perspective, a British judge has ruled that Craig Wright is not the creator of Bitcoin, Satoshi Nakamoto. Wright is one of the creators of Bitcoin SV (BSV), or Bitcoin Satoshi Vision. For years, the developer gathered support from community members who believed in his, now-proven, lie.
As developed, some old BSV supporters turned their attention, and capital, to Bitcoin Cash following the judgment. This could have helped boost the BCH price surge, increasing the capital flow to Bitcoin’s historical nemesis.
Bitcoin Cash halving in early April
Like Bitcoin, Bitcoin Cash’s block subsidy also halves every 210,000 blocks or approximately every four years. Also, BCH’s next halving will happen in the block height of 840,000, expected to happen on April 4.

This event has relevant economic effects, considering the supply emission will diminish by half, lowering miners’ potential sell-offs. In this context, the halving event historically had a positive impact on cryptocurrency prices.
In summary, Bitcoin Cash is again in the spotlight following positive expectations on its halving, a BSV migration after Craig Wrights’s judgment, and the launch of a new book telling block-size war stories, by Roger Ver.
More factors could have been in play to fuel the BCH price surge, and the market now wonders what is next for the, now, top 14 most valuable cryptocurrency.

The AI-based trailing stops also ensure that traders manage their risk better and protect their trading capital. 
Algotech leverages AI to enable traders to identify arbitrage opportunities in different asset pairs and take automated entries. In addition to that, Algoecth offers users access to several trading tools including trading strategies, community resources, and trading education. 
Why is Algotech attracting investors?
The Algotech presale is now in its third stage, with 2.5% of the tokens earmarked for this stage already sold. Overall, 89,483,947 ALGT tokens have been sold, amounting to $3,579,357.880.
The impressive numbers recorded by Algotech can be attributed to the project’s strong potential. The team revealed that there would be a total supply of 350 million ALGT tokens. 10% of the tokens have been allocated to R&D and funding for testing, durability and performance on the current and new algorithms. 
10% of the total token supply has been allocated for support in promotion and bounty to partners. The founders will hold on to only 7% of the total supply while the team gets a 3% allocation. Finally, 70% of the total token supply is available for public sale (including marketing).

Should you buy the ALGT token now?
The Algotech third presale round has begun, which means that the token now goes for $0.08. So far, the project has raised more than $3.5 million in less than a month. 
Historically, presale is the best time to invest in a project as it gives investors access to the tokens at a discount price. With the right level of adoption, ALGT could become an excellent token in the medium to long term.
The Algotech platform presents traders with multiple arbitrage strategies that enable the platform to earn profits by exploiting price discrepancies across several exchanges.

Dogecoin whales bag 1.4 billion tokens: Will it flip DOGE price predictions? - AMBCrypto



DOGE’s price surged by 33% in the last seven days. 
A few indicators hinted at a possible price correction.

Dogecoin [DOGE], the world’s largest meme coin, created a lot of buzz over the last few weeks as its price rallied substantially. Though there might be several factors that helped DOGE showcase this performance, one of the main reasons could be whale activity. 
Dogecoin whales are hungry
The entire crypto market remained more or less bullish last week as Bitcoin [BTC] went above the $70k mark. But Dogecoin was the star of the show, as according to CoinMarketCap, the meme’s value surged by more than 33% in just the last seven days. 
Meanwhile, Ali, a popular crypto analyst, posted a tweet highlighting an interesting development regarding DOGE whales. As per the tweet, whales purchased 1.40 billion DOGE over the past two weeks. 
The worth of the bought coins was more than $280 million. This clearly indicated that the big players were confident in DOGE and expected the meme coin’s price to rise further in the coming days. 
AMBCrypto’s analysis of Santiment’s data revealed that whale activity around DOGE continued to remain high during the last few days as well. This was evident from the massive rise in its whale transaction counts.
 As the price increased, DOGE’s popularity rose as its social volume surged. The memecoin’s weighted sentiment also shot up on the 28th of March, suggesting that bullish sentiment around the meme coin was dominant in the market.

Is a trend reversal waiting? 
Though the past week was bullish, Dogecoin’s daily chart turned red as its value went down slightly. According to CoinMarketCap, at the time of writing, DOGE was trading at $0.2138 with a market capitalization of over $30 billion, making it the 8th largest crypto. 
To check if there could be a reversal, AMBCrypto took a closer look at DOGE’s metrics. We found that despite a short downtick, DOGE’s MVRV ratio continued to remain high. 
Additionally, its funding rate was also green, meaning that derivatives investors were actively buying DOGE.

We then analyzed Dogecoin’s daily chart. Our analysis revealed that the technical indicator MACD displayed a clear bullish upperhand in the market. 
However, the chances of a price correction can’t be ruled out as the Money Flow Index (MFI) had entered the overbought zone. This might increase selling pressure on the meme coin and in turn drop its price.

Israeli Startups Lead the Charge in Exporting Advanced AI Military Technology

Israel’s innovation startups are increasingly shifting toward exporting cutting-edge military technology—all empowered with artificial intelligence. That includes technologies honed by the Israelis through their deployment in conflicts, like the ongoing Israel-Hamas war, to new military capabilities aimed at better precision, decision-making, and effectiveness on the battlefield.Israeli startups at the forefront of military tech innovationIsraeli firms at the forefront of leading this transformation include Axon Vision and Asio Technologies, which are developing and applying AI-driven military technologies. The Edge 360 system from Axon Vision is an AI-driven all-terrain camper mounted in armored vehicles; a new vision of the war. Helps improve situational awareness and, in turn, speeds up the process of decision-making by having the ability to identify threats from all directions, hence putting the man inside at a very great advantage.The Orion mission support platform is designed by Asjson Technologies and goes through its first trials amid the ongoing Israel-Hamas conflict. Orion has the capability of calculating ideal approach routes to a target such that the target is allowed the least exposure to enemy fire. Offline mode functions ensure reliability is not compromised during cases of communication link failures.A global demand for advanced military technologyThat puts more evidence in great interest in these technologies in the world market when the countries aim at renovating their possibilities in military activity with the help of the most advanced solutions based on AI. Axon Vision also saw the opportunity for the export of its technology and conducted marketing research to quantify the demand for modernizing armored vehicles across the globe. Similarly, Asio Technologies has plans to export the Orion platform and has received expressions of interest from different countries, including Asian states.Not only that but the phenomenon has also been fueled by the startup culture. The technology for the Iron Dome air defense system, of course, comes from Rafael Advanced Defense Systems and the Trophy system to protect its armored vehicles from incoming anti-tank missiles, all companies that come from already established Israeli defense contractors such as Israel Aerospace Industries.Ethical and legal considerationsHowever, this tendency toward further automation and AI in military technologies is not uncriticized. Not just the General Assembly but also other United Nations organs have expressed deep concern that the level of civilian harm would rise, as would the risk of such autonomous lethal weapon systems running out of control if they were made available to non-state parties. Moreover, such technologies raise ethical and legal questions with the development and implementation of these technologies in light of reports from health authorities in Gaza that point to a rapid increase in civilian casualties in the current conflict.But dual-use technology, for both civilian and military purposes, is very much in demand even then. Countries have been susceptible to the balance of the application of state-of-the-art technologies in the protection of forces and ethical use or deployment pertaining to the crisis zones.A catalyst for innovation It is no wonder that in such a special environment, for instance, that of Israel, where most of the young people are forced to have military service, good knowledge of advanced technologies and many contacts are developed. In the area, a great number of startups have been founded that develop up-to-the-minute military technology. Ongoing conflicts in the area have been prompted by a developing trend that has a concern for the life protection of soldiers while ensuring effective operations.The world will have onlookers with a debating point with the evolution of this military technology in Israel: how to maintain a balance between this innovation and ethical consideration within the ambit of the international legal framework. The exports in Israeli military technology indicate a global trend towards more automation with AI-driven warfare and set new international security and defense strategy benchmarks.

Daniel Cheung, co-founder of Syncracy Capital, says a bullish run is just around the corner for Filecoin (FIL). Cheung describes FIL as a "sleeping giant" poised to awaken during this cycle.Significance of Banyan & Basin launchThe Syncracy Capital co-founder took to X to express his bullish sentiment on Filecoin. He gave three key reasons for his optimism and shared the same with members of the crypto community. These include the potential launch of Banyan & Basin, other key primitive launches and being versatile beyond being a storage protocol.Cheung maintains that the imminent launch of Banyan & Basin is a significant milestone that could signal a turning point for Filecoin, paving the way for a broader enterprise adoption. His prediction is similar to the one made by crypto expert Ali Martinez, who spotted a bullish trend in the Filecoin price chart back in late February.Martinez had advised investors to keep an eye on a key resistance point at $8.50 then, with the price of Filecoin already surpassing $9 at the moment. Besides that, Cheung also anticipates that many other key primitives will be launched and this will serve as a catalyst for the growth of Filecoin beyond its storage-focused origin. Cheung predicts that this will expand into areas such as retrieval and compute functionalities.Filecoin's versatility is beyond storageAccording to Cheung, Filecoin's potential extends far beyond being a mere storage protocol. He asserts that it represents a thriving ecosystem with the capacity to become one of the cornerstone blockchains in Web3.0. Interestingly, Filecoin’s market price dynamics have remained in a solid position with predictions showing a potential 29.98% increase.Cheung anticipates that the upcoming developments within the Filecoin ecosystem will solidify its position as a critical player in the decentralized internet infrastructure. Beginning from the end of February, the value of Filecoin has gained over 107%, indicating an upsurge in market sentiment.As Filecoin continues to expand its capabilities, investors and enthusiasts alike eagerly watch to see how it will fare among competitors and if Daniel Cheung’s bullish sentiments of an incoming summer for Filecoin will play out.

Bitcoin's Bullish Momentum Falters as Price Corrects to $68,430 Amid Waning Investor Optimism



                    
Bitcoin‘s price underwent a minor correction, dropping to $68,430 on March 27, after it struggled to surpass the $71,000 mark. 



This movement comes amidst signs of waning bullish sentiment among professional traders, highlighted by derivatives data. 




The failure to breach this level raises concerns about the stability of the $69,000 price point.



Despite the price rallying from $63,800 to $70,000 in the five days leading to this dip, the Bitcoin futures markets saw a mere $151 million in leveraged short positions liquidated. 



This cautious stance by bears is noteworthy, especially considering the significant $888 million withdrawal from U.S. Bitcoin spot ETFs the previous week.




Bitcoin, however, showcased its resilience by bouncing back from a substantial 17.6% fall mid-March, without instigating panic among spot ETF investors. 



This resilience was thought to be driven by unexpected inflows into spot ETFs, marking an important trend for bulls ahead of the anticipated April Bitcoin halving.



March 26 reversed the outflow trend, with spot ETFs experiencing $418 million in net inflows, signifying genuine institutional interest despite Bitcoin’s price lingering close to its peak. 



Yet, the community remains uncertain if the $69,000 mark will hold as a strong support level.



The sentiment among professional traders has shown a decrease in optimism. 



For instance, Binance’s long-to-short ratio among professional traders slightly fell from 1.50 to 1.42, indicating a decrease in bullish sentiment.

Similarly, on OKX, a significant drop in the long-to-short ratio was observed, pointing to a broader sentiment shift among top traders.



This declining optimism could be attributed to broader economic concerns, including the performance of the S&P 500 index and uncertainty over the U.S. Federal Reserve’s interest rate decisions for 2024. 



The prospect of rate cuts, typically beneficial for risk-on assets like Bitcoin, seems unlikely in the near term, with the fixed-income markets betting against a rate reduction at the Fed’s upcoming May 1 meeting.



Analysts, including Paul Hickey from Bespoke Investment Group, express concerns over various factors impacting the market, such as the potential risks associated with a lack of earnings growth and the overemphasis on artificial intelligence within the stock market.



Furthermore, the shift in trading preferences among Bitcoin’s top traders, moving away from leveraged long positions, reflects a broader caution influenced by global economic downturns, regulatory actions, and discussions on limiting cryptocurrency transactions. 



This cautious sentiment, however, does not necessarily predict a drop below the $69,000 threshold, instead reflecting wider economic and regulatory concerns.

Opportunity? Bitcoin's next 'immediate target' is a fresh all-time high


Bitcoin (BTC) is currently hovering and consolidating above the $70,000 mark, partly buoyed by a slowdown in outflows from spot exchange-traded funds (ETFs). With the cryptocurrency having recently shattered two record highs within days, all eyes are on its potential for yet another historic milestone.
In this regard, TradingShot, a crypto trading expert, shared insights in a TradingView post on March 30. According to the analysis, Bitcoin’s technical indicators strongly point to a bullish immediate price target that could pave the way for a new record high of $78,000.
Bitcoin price analysis chart. Source: TradingView
The analyst pointed out that Bitcoin is mirroring a fractal pattern observed in the S&P 500 index, albeit in different time frames. While Bitcoin operates on a four-hour time frame, the S&P 500 analysis is on a weekly time frame. 


The analysis notes that Bitcoin is retracing toward its four-hour moving average of 50 (MA50) and is on the verge of forming a bullish cross. The analyst draws parallels with the S&P 500 fractal and suggests that investors should perceive this cross as a significant buy signal. This signal, much like it was for the S&P 500, initiated an aggressive rally that continues to dominate the market.
Additionally, the comparison notes that the asset classes commenced with a bearish megaphone pattern following their respective peaks. Subsequently, they reached and maintained their moving average of 200 (MA200).
Bitcoin overbought territory
From a Relative Strength Index (RSI) perspective, both Bitcoin and the S&P 500 experienced a similar journey, with a channel-up pattern leading them to the overbought territory subsequent to an oversold double bottom formation, which acted as an additional buy signal.
He noted that based on this analysis, Bitcoin is currently in the 0.786 rejection phase. Upon completion of this pullback, the S&P 500 fractal suggests that Bitcoin’s immediate target should hover around the 1.382 Fibonacci extension, culminating in a value of approximately $78,000. 
It’s worth noting that Bitcoin is currently maintaining its position above $70,000 after successfully avoiding a dip below the $60,000 threshold. This sustained stability is partly due to reduced outflows from most spot ETFs, coupled with anticipation surrounding the upcoming halving event.
Bitcoin price analysis
As of the time of writing, Bitcoin was trading at $70,180, marking gains of nearly 9% over the past seven days.

In addition to the factors surrounding the upcoming halving and ETF flows, the current price of Bitcoin remains susceptible to decisions made by the Federal Reserve regarding interest rates.

Hacker Reveals New Demands from Altcoin Developers in the Most Discussed Hacking Event of Recent Days - Bitcoin Sistemi


A self-proclaimed white hat hacker attacked Prisma Finance, causing a significant decrease in the total value locked in the protocol. In the latest development, the hacker in question asked the Prisma Finance team to hold an online press conference where all team members would show their KYC credentials and apologize.
However, data shows that the hacker used Tornado Cash to obfuscate more than 3,000 ETH, casting doubt on his white hat claims and suggesting malicious intent. As a result of the attack, the total value locked in the protocol dropped from approximately $220 million to $115 million.



In response to the attack, Prisma Protocol was placed on emergency multisig pause as a precaution to ensure the safety of remaining funds. Despite the attack, Prisma Finance shared with users that stablecoins such as mkUSD and ULTRA remained over-collateralized and safe.
The person behind the attack claimed that the hack in question was a “white hat recovery” operation and expressed his intention to return the funds.

Trader Nets Over 27,600% in Profit on a Memecoin Built on the Base Layer-2 Blockchain: Lookonchain - The Daily Hodl


								A trader is seeing over 27,600% in profits after investing in a memecoin launched on the Ethereum (ETH) layer-2 scaling solution Base.
According to blockchain tracking firm Lookonchain, one smart trader turned $18,000 into $5 million – a gain of 27,677% – after purchasing Degen (DEGEN) in January.










“Only invested 7.35 ETH ($18,000) on DEGEN, this trader made ~$5 million, a gain of 272x! He spent 7.35 ETH ($18,000) to buy 260 million DEGEN on January 15th and January 21st. Then sold 102.5 million DEGEN for 1.26 million USDC, with 157.5 million DEGEN (3.75 million) left.”
DEGEN, which has a market cap of $328.57 million, is trading for $0.0258 at time of writing, up 2.69% in the last 24 hours.
Lookonchain also noticed that a deep-pocketed early Ethereum investor suddenly sold a massive amount of the top altcoin for huge profits.
“An early holder of ETH sold 17,770 ETH for 62.24 million DAI at $3,503 [on March 27th]. He accumulated 14,280 ETH (cost $2.6 million) at an average price of only ~$182 from Gemini and Bittrex from March 2017 and April 2021.
The profit is $59 million, a gain of 23x!” 
Ethereum is trading for $3,511 at time of writing, down 1.50% in the last 24 hours.
Lastly, Lookonchain spotted one investor quickly turning 50 Solana (SOL) into 2,828 SOL by trading Solana-based memecoin cat in a dogs world (MEW).
“Starting with only 50 SOL, this trader turned it into 2,828 SOL ($531,000) in just two days! 
Let’s see how he did it. 
The trader spotted MEW 20 minutes after opening trading and withdrew 50 SOL from MEXC to buy it. He spent 30 SOL to buy 368.3 million MEW and sold 200.2 million MEW for 2,828 SOL ($530,000). He still has 168.02 million MEW ($353,000) left, and the total profit is ~$877,000.”

At time of writing, MEW is worth $0.00548, up over 113% in the past day.

Ripple May Dump 3,121,229,382 XRP as SEC Demands $1.95B Fine - Coin Edition


							

U.S. SEC submitted its initial remedies brief and proposed judgment in the Ripple case.



The SEC wants Ripple to remit over $1.95 billion in fines for violating securities laws.



Ripple may liquidate over 3.12 billion XRP to raise the penalty of $1.95 billion.




The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) recently submitted its initial remedies brief, proposed judgment, and accompanying exhibits in the Ripple case. Meanwhile, the SEC’s recent filing proposing judgment has sparked interest among crypto market participants.



In particular, the regulator explicitly requested that the court mandate Ripple to remit $1,950,768,364 in fines and penalties for its breach of federal securities laws. As per the SEC’s stipulation, Ripple must settle the $1.95 billion sum within 30 days following the court’s adoption and issuance of the proposed judgment as the final ruling.









If the court rules in favor of the SEC without Ripple appealing the decision, the payment company will be compelled to raise the $1.95 billion within 30 days of the final judgment. One potential avenue for Ripple to raise funds to meet this demand could be selling its XRP tokens, particularly those held in escrow. 



As of March 24, Ripple API data shows the firm held 40,100,000,005 XRP in escrow wallets. Given the asset’s prevailing market price of $0.6250, Ripple may liquidate 3,121,229,382 XRP tokens to raise $1,950,768,364. 



Such a massive sell-off could have significant implications for the price of XRP, potentially causing its price to tank significantly. Besides, Ripple’s monthly sale of XRP has been known to impact XRP’s price albeit slightly. 



It is important to note that this scenario is speculative, pending the court’s decision and any potential appeals by Ripple. Moreover, the company is set to file its opposition to the SEC’s reply brief next month, aiming to challenge the proposed judgment.

3 best Cardano tokens to invest in 2024


The Cardano (ADA) ecosystem has shown multiple growth signals in the past few years. Investors now look for promising tokens being built on Cardano to invest in 2024, to capitalize on this growth.
Notably, decentralized finance (DeFi) data from DefiLlama evidence how the Cardano ecosystem has improved lately. The total value locked (TVL) in Cardano tokens reached $422.63 million, a nearly 10 times increase from the $50 million on January 1, 2023.
Together, the daily volume registered by decentralized exchanges grew from $854,240 to $5.69 million in the same period. This is a direct result of increased crypto trading and investing activity among the best Cardano ecosystem coins and protocols.

Best Cardano ecosystem coins and tokens to consider investing in
In the meantime, ADA, the network’s native token, is trading at $0.65 by press time. With a market cap of $23.025 billion, it signals an overbought DeFi asset – 54 times higher than its TVL.
However, more than just investing in Cardano’s native token, investors can gain exposure to dozens of the ecosystem’s innovative protocols. Finbold selected three of the best projects and their respective tokens being built on the Cardano blockchain.
Indigo (INDY)
First, Indigo (INDY) navigates the real-world asset (RWA) narrative, attracting capital and valuable demand to its protocol. The Indigo Protocol allows users to create Cardano tokens that are synthetic versions of RWAs, called iAssets. 
Indigo has seen an impressive surge in its total value locked, to $106.63 million. Interestingly, INDY’s price action and market cap did not follow the growth, currently at $2.5 and $27.17 million, respectively.
Cardano tokens: Indigo (INDY). Source: DefiLlama
Minswap (MIN) to swap Cardano tokens
Second, the most popular decentralized exchange in the Cardano DeFi ecosystem is Minswap (MIN), allowing traders to swap their coins and tokens.
The protocol has $88.93 million in total value locked, twice the value of MIN’s $44.78 million market cap. Meanwhile, the token trades at $0.039, and its platform makes over $5 million in swap volume, consolidating its market share.
Cardano tokens: Minswap (MIN). Source: DefiLlama
Liqwid (LQ)
In closure, Liquid (LQ) features as the third-most promising Cardano token to watch and possibly invest in 2024. The protocol allows for decentralized borrowing and lending, with yield generation for ADA and other of the best ecosystem coins.
In total, $54.35 million is locked, providing liquidity to the protocol, while LQ trades at $2.67.

As observed, Cardano is becoming a rich ecosystem with promising tokens and projects for this year. Nevertheless, investors must learn how to identify the best Cardano ecosystem coins and their respective entry points to improve results.

Bitcoin Steals the Show as the US Economy Sends Mixed Signals - DailyCoin


        
Bitcoin’s price has surged, tied to inflation hedge searches and possible US dollar devaluation.



Strong economic indicators have surfaced, countering worries about potential Fed policy changes.



Stock markets have hit new highs and the PMI is recovering, signifying growth, although interest rate hikes remain a threat.
Financial markets are experiencing a period of mixed signals, with a recent surge in Bitcoin’s price amidst concerns about future economic stability. While Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell expressed optimism, citing data-driven policy and controlled inflation, some analysts remain wary.Strong Economy, Rising Bitcoin: Will Inflation Sway the Fed?Powell’s confidence contrasted with anxieties voiced by investors like Jason Trennert, CEO of Strategas Research Partners. Trennert points to the potential for economic turbulence due to a lack of coordination between fiscal and monetary policies.  The ever-growing national debt adds fuel to these concerns, particularly regarding potential devaluation of the US dollar.This uncertain climate appears to be driving a renewed interest in Bitcoin. Regulatory advancements like the approval of a Bitcoin ETF, coupled with the rise in gold prices, suggest a broader trend of investors seeking alternative assets perceived as inflation hedges.
Financial expert Richard Bernstein weighed in on the situation, highlighting a potential shift in Federal Reserve policy. While strong economic indicators like a recovering PMI, record stock market highs, and substantial Bitcoin liquidity paint a seemingly positive picture, Bernstein warns that significant inflation spikes could force the Fed’s hand.Fed Confidence vs. Investor AnxietiesThe PMI, a key indicator of business activity, has bounced back after a period of weakness. This signals expansion in manufacturing and service sectors, potentially suggesting healthy economic growth. Additionally, the stock market’s continued climb to record highs could be interpreted as investor confidence in the overall health of the economy.
However, Bernstein cautions that the Fed may be forced to raise interest rates to combat inflation, which could trigger a correction in the stock market and impact Bitcoin’s price. This complex interplay between economic factors and investor sentiment is what lies at the heart of the recent surge in Bitcoin. On the Flipside
A recovering PMI and record stock highs paint a positive picture, but external factors or unforeseen events could still trigger an economic downturn.



While Powell expressed confidence in controlling inflation, the path forward for interest rates remains unclear.



The national debt and potential devaluation of the US dollar remain issues, even with increased interest in Bitcoin.
Why This MattersThis confluence of economic unease, Federal Reserve policy shifts, and Bitcoin’s price surge illuminates a potential turning point for the cryptocurrency market. As investors seek havens from potential inflation and a weakening dollar, Bitcoin’s performance as an alternative asset could influence broader market trends and adoption within the traditional financial landscape.Curious about Bitcoin’s price action in the lead up to a halving event?

JPMorgan Chase Executive Steals $2,400,000 From Customers, Admits To Taking Cash from 74-Year Old Wheelchair-Bound Client - The Daily Hodl


								An ex-JPMorgan Chase executive has admitted to stealing $2.4 million from the banks’ clients, new court documents show.
In a judgment filed on March 15th at the US District Court in the Southern District of New York, Judge Denise L. Cote sentences Kevin Chiu to 48 months in prison after he pleaded guilty to bank fraud.










According to government prosecutors, Chiu stole from at least six accounts held by five different customers by using his position to transfer funds out of their accounts without their authorization or knowledge.
After taking control of the customers’ funds, Chiu then used them to trade securities, pay personal expenses, and cover up his thefts from some accounts by replacing the missing funds with more funds he stole from other accounts.
Prosecutors say one of the victims, who lost $900,000 to Chiu’s misconduct, was a 74-year-old wheelchair-bound woman who trusted him to manage most of her finances.
“She requested instead that the defendant hand her a copy of her account statement when she would visit the branch. She trusted the defendant to manage her finances. 
The defendant took advantage of this arrangement to steal almost a million dollars from her account, nearly draining it, and then created false account statements—that he handed to her personally when she would visit him at the branch in a wheelchair—to hide that any money was missing.
 He also took advantage of her trust and reliance on him by asking her to sign blank transaction forms when she was in the branch, which he used to steal her money.”
On top of the prison time, Chiu is also ordered to pay $1.6 million in restitution, and will be on probation for three years following his release.

Solana (SOL) Continues To Soar - How High Can It Go?


                            The Solana network’s native cryptocurrency, SOL, has been on an upward surge in the past three days, climbing from around $180 to over $210.
Having failed to break its previous low of $162.74, the coin, which is currently ranked 5th in the crypto market with a total supply of 441 million and a market capitalization of over $88 billion, SOL is showing no signs of stopping.
Will Solana Continue To Surge Upward?
At the time of writing, Solana has been up by 6.25% trading around $198 in the past 24 hours, and has broken above the previous resistance level of $195. The price is also trading above the 100-day moving average on the 4-hour chart of the SOL/USD pair. If the price continues to move upward, it might break above its major resistance level of $210 and move even higher to create a new high for the year. 
All these can be seen in the image below:

Looking at the chart with the help of the RSI (Relative Strength Index) indicator in the image above, we can see that the RSI line is trending above the 50 level. This is an indication that the price of SOL is still in a bullish zone and could even surge further upward. 
A further look at the 4-hour timeframe chart with the help of the MACD indicator, we can see that the MACD is on the bullish side as the MACD line, the signal line, and the MACD histogram are all trending above the zero line.
Finally, using the bull vs bear power histogram indicator, it appears buyers have taken over the market with powerful momentum and are ready to push the price even higher. 
We can confirm this in the image below:

With the momentum that Solana is moving with, there is a possibility that it could break above its previous resistance level of $210.27. If this manages to happen we could see prices soaring higher especially with the level of demand momentum in the market
Could SOL Dip?
If the price of Solana fails to break above the resistance level of $210, it could start a downside correction to its initial support level of 162. If the price closes below this support level, it could decline even further and probably start a downward trend.

Funding Wrap: Crypto startup accelerators are growing in number - Blockworks


Amidst a revival of interest in crypto ventures, some Web3 startups are hoping to gain a leg up via accelerator programs.
Startup accelerators provide founders with mentorship and guidance in exchange for early equity in their company. Perhaps the most famous example is San Francisco-based Y Combinator, which counts numerous crypto firms — including Coinbase and OpenSea — as alumni. 
Read more: Funding Wrap: Y Combinator wants more stablecoin startups
The blue-chip tech VC fund a16z announced the cohort chosen for its spring 2024 crypto startup accelerator this week. The group of 25 startups will spend ten weeks in London being mentored by the a16z crypto team. Among the list posted by a16z operating partner Jason Rosenthal were projects for Farcaster infrastructure, decentralized food delivery and zero-knowledge passport authentication. 
Startups in a16z crypto’s accelerator each get a $500,000 investment from a16z in exchange for 7% equity. Alumni of the program include research and development organization Flashbots and wallet platform Phantom.

Also this week, the foundation behind the layer-1 blockchain Avalanche announced the inaugural cohort in its own accelerator, called Codebase. The accelerator is only for startups building on Avalanche, and an AVAX-focused decentralized VC named Colony Lab will be investing between $500,000 and $1 million per startup. 
Web3 gaming infrastructure firm Helika announced it would be teaming up with Pantera, Spartan Capital, Sfermion and other VC firms to funnel up to $50 million to startups in its newly-launched gaming accelerator. 
All this comes as venture capital shows a renewed vigor in the crypto space. Crypto-native firm 1kx announced it had raised an oversubscribed $75 million fund on Thursday. Hack VC closed a $150 million round late last month.
Symbolic Capital principal Sam Lehman said strong crypto accelerators can build community for founders in the very network-centric Web3 space. 
Lehman added that the proliferation of new crypto accelerators could be partly from funds wanting to grow their brand or to quickly deploy capital into startups. And some accelerators can be predatory.
“Some accelerators are using the early stage at which they invest plus their proposed ‘value-add’ to come in and take extremely big positions in companies right off the bat. Founders should definitely think twice about whether the terms they’d accept from an accelerator are worth what they’d receive in return,” Lehman said in a text.
Web3 gaming stays hot
Investment rounds in Web3 gaming have quietly grown in size and number in recent months. The latest example is Parallel Studios, which just announced a $35 million round that drew investment from VanEck, Solana Ventures and The Spartan Group, among others.

Parallel Studios developed the buzzy NFT-enabled card game Parallel, which just recently opened to the public in beta. It’s also building an AI-enabled strategy game called Colony. 
Gunzilla Games, MyPrize, Elixir Games, and Illuvium are all gaming projects that raised funds in excess of $10 million this week.
Other notable fundraises

AI agent creation platform MyShell raised $11 million in pre-Series A funding led by Dragonfly.
DePIN-focused blockchain project peaq drew $15 million in a round led by Borderless Capital and Generative Ventures.
Data availability startup 0G Labs raised $35 million.
Polychain led a $15.3 million investment in intent-centric execution network dappOS in a round valuing the startup at $300 million.

Warzone Season 3 Introduces Warzone Bootcamp Training Mode

With the latest one, Warzone season 3, the gamer’s planet is now buzzing as it brings in a lot of new updates, including the return of the most loved and famous map, Rebirth Island. Among the array of new features and improvements, players can now sharpen their skills in the latest addition: Warzone Forces.Warzone training for battleIn Warzone Class: This new training level facility created by Sledgehammer Games will help the players (new and experienced players) train and improve their battlefield skills. They get their kick from the Combat Training mode in the other Call of Duty games. It puts players in a part of the Urzikstan map, which is new every time but helps players familiarize themselves with the game mechanisms, different weapon designs, and strategies.The main battlefield where the players face the challenge is considered Warzone Boot Camp because, in this place, the players go against 20 real players and 24 bots specially programmed to emulate human players’ feelings. This is not only full-fledged but also dependent on the type of players. The players will be adequately but sufficiently governed. Regrettably, Without consideration for their expertise or experience level, they may be forced to engage in the game. It might be lining up shots, playing around with movement skills, or the approach to fighting situations you wish to learn; the Warzone Bootcamp program offers a chance to boost your skills in all these areas.Accessible yet limitationsKnowing that Warzone Bootcamp covers the entire playing audience with varying experience levels. However, the weaknesses of it should also be considered. Unlike some regular modes, Warzone Bootcamp has no progression features. This means there is no way by which players could earn experience points or, as a result, level up their weapons. Not only this issue, but the PS5 also lacks a similar range of engagement as special events and contracts in repairing regular Warzone matches. However, despite drawbacks, such as limited game time and contact with snipers, Warzone Bootcamp’s availability and focused training make it a worthwhile killer.Warzone Season 3 brings Warzone Bootcamp in her wake. This is an instructive mode focused on improving a killer’s skillset in the arena and assists him/her in achieving such a level of confidence that he/she can conquer every opponent on the battlefield ahead of him/her. In the mixed domain of human players and AI players, the Warzone Bootcamp provides players with exciting ways to practice troubleshooting and combat tactics.Although the game lacks a clear progression path and some of the standard mechanics used in games, the ease of access and dedicated training at Warzone Bootcamp are some thoughtful features that make the game a worthy component of Warzone players’ gaming experience. Players can immerse themselves in the established gameplay scenario of the launch of Season 3 while preparing themselves for more intensified challenges of Warzone Bootcamp. This boot camp is always willing to provide a far better level of training to the players to polish their skills and improve their play style.

The Future of Healthcare: Navigating the Role of AI in Global Health

In a world where technology and healthcare combine on a higher level, the role of artificial intelligence (AI) in bringing the future of global health is epic. The rise of digital health technologies and AI with exponential growth forces must be considered strong advances within healthcare systems, according to the presence of a collaborative, internationally harmonized approach to regulating AI health solutions.Rapid advances occurring within computing power and keen interests in harnessing AI and machine learning to improve healthcare delivery are encouraged in such a trend.Strategic integration of AI in healthcareAI in healthcare is truly revolutionary: this hints at a transition to more effective, efficient, and personalized medical care. In the digital health scope, if translated, some advent is software, apps, and AI themselves referring to a reformation in patient support, support of health professionals, management of the health system, and data service. Furthermore, the use of these technologies applies to public health interventions and some specific diagnostic and therapeutic applications used in combination with related medical devices and diagnostic tests.The march toward generalization in the use of digital health technologies has not been rosy. It is specifically most important due to a lack of harmonization in strategies and specific guidelines for market access, safety, and quality, which can roll out technologies at full scale. But the scenario is fast changing. There seems to be an emerging consensus that, to break free from the traditional silos of privacy, safety, and quality considerations, an inclusive approach covering AI within the broader framework of health policy needs to be adopted.Paving the way for responsible AI in healthcareThe debate about the application of AI in health is maturing, focusing on responsible development and use. Policymakers will increasingly take note of the need to understand risks and functionality of AI solutions, from low-risk applications in monitoring to higher-risk AI-based diagnostic and clinical decision-support tools. A third goal, of course, is the setting of evidence standards for AI solutions.Indeed, such standards are well-designed not only to guide the health professional in the evaluation of AI technologies but also to assure the alignment of evaluated technologies with the goals and values of the healthcare system.Furthermore, the importance of conducting robust studies on AI cannot be overstated. Benchmarking AI applications and enhancing their effectiveness and safety demand very high-quality research. The two main characteristics of AI in healthcare remain continuous learning and adaptation, thus calling for continued evaluation and public engagement with the principles of Responsible AI.Efforts in this regard are being facilitated at the international level of collaboration through best practice sharing, harmonization of policies, and joint efforts regarding the challenges presented by the technologies of artificial intelligence.International collaboration: A keystone for AI in healthcareBoth the global character of health problems and the universal potential of AI solutions underline the importance of the international character of research. Agencies such as the World Health Organization and the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development need to foster forums for the exchange of insights into the rapidly changing paradigms AI is taking in healthcare. These partnerships should work to establish the policy environment in such a way that it balances the promotion of innovation with the mitigation of risks to make sure the technology of AIs serves the public’s interest.Such an attempt to build up a model of continuous learning would be regarded through changing paradigms of AI in health. The much-favored approach of learning health systems, emphasizes constant adaptation and improvement in healthcare delivery. That adoption model could help the healthcare sector in such a way that the maximization of AI potential towards gains in making headway for better outcomes, improved patient experience, and operational optimization is realized.The role of AI in global health is multifaceted and dynamic. When the healthcare industry is going through unchartered territory, it is very important to lay down a very solid framework for responsible innovation, ensuring patient safety and privacy, and most importantly, ensuring international cooperation. Such principles form the guiding structure to integrate AI into healthcare and promise none but a new era of medical excellence and promise for embracing equity in health.

As Ethereum's price experiences a temporary dip, a notable trend has emerged, indicating potential long-term implications for the cryptocurrency's value.Rising whale transactions, particularly among large Ethereum holders, have sparked interest among analysts and investors as a potential indicator of Ethereum's future price trajectory.In recent weeks, Ethereum's blockchain has witnessed a surge in whale transactions, which are large transfers of ETH carried out by entities holding significant amounts of the cryptocurrency and are often greater than $100,000.The rising number of whale transactions on Ethereum's blockchain is being viewed by some analysts as an indicator of the cryptocurrency's long-term price trends.According to crypto analyst Ali, despite the Ethereum price correction seen over the past few weeks, ETH whale transactions are on the rise, which is a bullish indicator for future ETH price movements. Historically, whale activity has been associated with significant price movements, with large transactions often signaling institutional interest or accumulation. As such, the current uptick in whale transactions could be interpreted as a bullish signal for Ethereum, suggesting underlying confidence in its prospects despite short-term price volatility.At the time of writing, ETH was slightly down 0.25% in the last 24 hours to $3,545.Update on Ethereum missing block incidentEthereum developers discussed the missing block incident which happened in the week during the most recent ACDE call, a bi-weekly meeting series where developers discuss and coordinate changes to the execution layer (EL) of Ethereum.On March 27, there was an uptick in the number of missing blocks. Every 30 minutes, 2% to 4% of blocks are typically missed on Ethereum. However, during a period when the network was experiencing a high volume of blob transactions, this percentage increased to more than 14% in just a few hours. Blob prices climbed by more than tenfold during this period.Terrence Tsao, an Ethereum developer, stated that the issue of missing blocks was quickly resolved as the Bloxroute team turned down their MEV relay. The specifics of what was causing the Bloxroute relay troubles remain unknown, but the Bloxroute team is working on a fix that they will disclose, along with a thorough post-mortem of the issues, in the coming days.In separate news, ETH developers have approved the inclusion of two retroactive Ethereum improvement proposals (EIPs) in the upcoming Prague/Electra upgrade: EIP 7610 and 7523.

Fox Journalists Says XRP Won’t Make You Rich, Here’s Why | Bitcoinist.com


								Charles Gasparino, an American journalist and a senior correspondent for Fox Business, has delivered a sobering message to XRP investors, warning them of the financial risks associated with XRP as Ripple navigates its regulatory battle with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC)
Gary Gensler Could Challenge XRP Ruling
In a recent X (formerly Twitter) post, Gasparino discussed the current regulatory situation between Ripple and the US SEC. The Fox Business journalist disclosed that the SEC government could potentially overturn the previous ruling made by Judge Analisa Torres regarding XRP.

According to Gasparino, if the current chair of the US SEC, Gary Gensler, were to classify Ethereum, the second largest cryptocurrency, as a security, then the government would spare no effort to reverse the ruling on XRP from July 2023. Back then, Judge Torres had ruled that programmatic sales of XRP should not be considered a security, granting the Ripple team a partial victory over the SEC. 
The Fox Business journalist asserted that if this scenario were to unfold, then XRP investors would “probably not get rich on XRP.” He revealed that investors could get even poorer depending on how things unfold. This is because if the SEC manages to overturn the Ripple ruling, XRP may see its price plummeting once again, with almost no chance of a comeback for years.  
While Gasparino has expressed a strong belief that the US SEC has a great chance of reversing the Ripple ruling, Gensler has yet to offer clear guidance on how Ethereum should be classified. 
The SEC chair has refrained from categorically declaring whether Ethereum is deemed a security or not. This lack of clarity has heightened uncertainty surrounding Ethereum’s classification, potentially exacerbating regulatory uncertainty within the digital asset ecosystem. 
Fox Journalist Echoes BlackRock’s XRP ETF Rejection
In another X post, Gasparino reiterated BlackRock’s stance on an XRP Exchange Traded Fund (ETF), highlighting that the asset management company is unlikely to approve an XRP ETF.

The Fox Business journalist conveyed the statement to XRP investors and supporters, emphasizing that BlackRock’s rejection of an XRP ETF was “sad”. Gasparino also criticized several XRP enthusiasts, stressing that the cryptocurrency had limited value. 
Currently, BlackRock’s position regarding the potential issuance of an XRP ETF remains uncertain. Despite denying rumors of planning to launch an XRP ETF in 2023, the asset management company has not definitively ruled out the possibility, instead, it is maintaining its primary focus on its Spot Bitcoin ETF.

Bitcoin Faces Sell-Side Liquidity Crisis as Demand Reaches Unprecedented Levels: CryptoQuant


																The chances of Bitcoin facing a sell-side liquidity crisis in the next few months are very high due to demand for the digital asset soaring to unprecedented levels.
According to a weekly report from CryptoQuant, analysts expect the present Bitcoin sell-side liquidity inventory to cover demand for six to twelve months. Conversely, a plunge in liquid inventory could pull Bitcoin’s (BTC) price northward.
Unprecedented Demand Levels
Monthly demand for Bitcoin has risen from 40,000 BTC at the start of 2024 to 213,000 BTC at writing time. CryptoQuant measures the demand by the 30-day growth in the total balance of accumulation addresses – those that only receive and hold BTC. For context, these addresses hold over 10 BTC, have no outflows, do not belong to any centralized exchanges (CEXs) or mining pools, and have been active in the last seven years.
The dramatic rise of BTC demand is driven by Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) in the United States and other large holders, like whales. Analysts found that the year-on-year growth in the total balance of whales sits at its highest level ever. Whales now hold roughly 1.57 million BTC, a significant increase from 874,000 BTC recorded at the beginning of 2024.
While demand soars, sell-side liquidity continues to decline. The amount of BTC at sell-side liquidity entities hovers around 2.7 million BTC, down from an all-time high of 3.5 million BTC recorded in March 2020. These entities have viable and liquid assets from which investors can purchase BTC. Some of them include CEX’ Bitcoin reserves, Bitcoin over-the-counter desks, Bitcoin miners, and seized BTC in the possession of the U.S. government.




Analysts also consider Grayscale’s GBTC Bitcoin holdings as sell-side liquidity because the ETF has added to the BTC supply for sale through massive investor redemptions. Without this fund, sell-side liquidity would have fallen to its lowest level, last seen in February 2018.
Impending Sell-Side Liquidity Crisis
With Bitcoin demand skyrocketing and sell-side liquidity falling, the liquid inventory of Bitcoin has plummeted to its lowest ever in terms of monthly demand.
“We estimate that the present Bitcoin sell-side liquidity inventory is only enough to cover demand growing at the current rate for twelve months. This is only considering demand from accumulating addresses, which may be considered as the lower-end of Bitcoin demand,” CryptoQuant stated.
Removing the BTC on CEXs outside the U.S. would further reduce the Bitcoin liquid inventory to six months, as U.S. spot ETFs would only source BTC from local entities.

Navigating the Risks of AI-Generated Resumes

Meanwhile, during this period, the OpenAI ChatGPT is increasingly used for the resume creation service. However, such an approach is driven by potential risks that job seekers can befall.As consumer-facing tools come under the dominion of AI and enterprise adoption takes shape across an array of functions, knowledge of the bounds and risks for AI-generated résumés is a sine qua non for staying ahead in a competitive job market.The explosive growth of ChatGPT and AI adoption From its first introduction in November 2022, OpenAI’s ChatGPT has grown at a lightning-fast pace to become the fastest-growing consumer internet application in history.The app had already attracted one million users in a mere five days, and within one month, the number of active users had shot to 100 million—an overwhelming achievement by all standards and measures taken against growth rates recorded by social media giants such as Twitter, Facebook, and Instagram. So far, ChatGPT commands 180 million monthly active users and is visited approximately 1.6 billion times in a month. This follows in the increased clout of AI applications across the board, from social media to professional AI tools like LinkedIn and Microsoft’s Copilot.However, in the integration of AI into enterprise solutions, the pace is relatively slow in terms of development speeds and long procurement cycles. Thejson-enabled tools in workplaces will, however, change a lot by the giant investments from the likes of Microsoft, injecting $13 billion into OpenAI.The pitfalls of AI-generated resumesIt can be quite tempting to use ChatGPT to create a resume; after all, it works so well and gets all the content it needs fast. But the risks involved in trusting AI with something as important as this are huge. The main one is related to personalization. Most of the help one could receive on writing a resume had been artificial intelligence-generated and, therefore, one would miss inserting personal input into the whole process that finally makes them unique among many. This often results in a resume that fails to capture the individuality and specific achievements of a job seeker well enough—therefore, one that, rather than appealing to an authentic, story-minded employer, fails to fully do so.AI tools also do not have complete updates on the recent trends in the industry, which might not be pinpointed at specific keywords employers are looking for. Because job markets are changing at a very rapid pace, the resume one uses should probably be highly customized for the specific job position and most important for the current standards and terminologies within the industry.That is to say, although advanced, AI-generated content at times does not fully match such nuances, hence disadvantages the candidate.Strategies for effective resume creationThat’s where job seekers should see such AI tools as a point for starting to write their resumes, rather than an ultimate solution. Adding personal stories, detailed achievements, and customizing skills mentioned in such drafts completely changed the perspective. Make sure you constantly update even trends in your business and include every new keyword and statement reflecting today’s requirements and standards. Mentored or guided by the industry professionals themselves, they could provide insights on how a résumé could be better improved to reflect his strengths and suitability for a post. With AI efficiency and human insight combined in our processes, the resume could easily be more persuasive and personalized in the hope that this might make a difference in a tough, overcrowded job market.Exciting as the possibilities of AI tools like ChatGPT in helping a job seeker create his or her resume may be, one should not rely on them too fully. All these risks, coupled with the lack of personalization that may bring up old, expired standards, just indicate that all this should be approached with a balanced mind. With AI at the core and linking personal experiences and insights, the candidate can develop resumes that reflect true capability and aspirations, positioning them in the best perspective for the eye of the potential employer.

Crypto PR Agency - Imperium Comms



                    
Crypto PR agency Imperium Comms offers media coverage on a results-driven, guaranteed basis. 



Public Relations (PR) in the crypto space is an intricate dance of strategy, credibility, and innovation. As the blockchain and cryptocurrency sectors burgeon, standing out amidst a sea of competitors while fostering trust and understanding among a diverse audience becomes paramount. This unique landscape demands a PR approach that not only navigates the complexities of these technologies but also taps into the pulse of an ever-evolving digital community.




The essence of PR in the crypto space revolves around building and maintaining a positive reputation, managing communication during crises, and effectively promoting innovations and developments to the right audience. Given the nascent and volatile nature of cryptocurrencies, coupled with the skepticism of the general public and regulatory bodies, the role of PR is both critical and challenging.



One of the foremost challenges in crypto PR is the need to demystify blockchain technology and cryptocurrencies for a broad audience. The concepts underlying these innovations can be complex and intimidating to the uninitiated. Effective PR strategies must therefore not only highlight the technological advancements and potential of a project but also make this information accessible and compelling to both seasoned crypto enthusiasts and newcomers alike.



Transparency and trustworthiness are the bedrock of successful PR in the crypto domain. Given the history of scams, hacks, and failed projects that have plagued the industry, establishing credibility is non-negotiable. This involves clear, consistent, and honest communication about a project’s goals, progress, and challenges. PR professionals must craft narratives that resonate with their audience’s values and aspirations, showcasing not just the potential for financial gain but also the project’s contribution to technological innovation and societal progress.




Engagement with the community is another cornerstone of crypto PR. The decentralized ethos of the blockchain community values participation, open dialogue, and collaboration. PR strategies must leverage social media, forums, and other platforms to foster a sense of community and belonging. Engaging content, regular updates, and active participation in discussions can build a loyal following and turn community members into brand advocates.



Crisis management takes on a heightened importance in the crypto space, where the impact of negative news can be amplified by the speed and reach of digital communication. Effective PR teams must be adept at anticipating potential issues, responding swiftly to crises, and regaining public trust. This could involve addressing security breaches, regulatory setbacks, or market volatility. The ability to navigate these crises transparently and confidently can set a project apart and demonstrate resilience and reliability.



Media relations also play a pivotal role in crypto PR. The industry’s dynamic nature, with its rapid developments and frequent regulatory changes, makes it a subject of media interest. Securing positive media coverage in leading crypto publications, as well as mainstream media, can significantly enhance a project’s visibility and credibility. PR professionals must cultivate relationships with journalists and influencers, pitch compelling stories, and position their projects as leaders in the space.



Moreover, the global nature of the cryptocurrency market demands an international PR strategy. Understanding and respecting cultural differences, regulatory environments, and market preferences across different regions is essential. Tailored messaging and campaigns that resonate with local audiences can drive global adoption and support.



Finally, education and thought leadership are invaluable in establishing authority and trust in the crypto space. By sharing insights, analysis, and predictions, projects can position themselves as thought leaders and go-to sources for reliable information. This not only enriches the community but also fosters a more informed and rational discourse around cryptocurrencies and blockchain technology.

Sphere 3D’s legal issues escalate as Gryphon seeks to block $10M

The legal battle between Bitcoin miners Sphere 3D and Gryphon Digital Mining has gotten another chapter on March 25, as a new legal action seeks to block $10 million from a recent settlement. In a pre-motion letter filed by Gryphon with the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York, the miner requests permission to file a motion for prejudgment attachment, seeking to secure $10 million in equity proceeds that Sphere recently received from a settlement related to Core Scientific’s bankruptcy exit.Gryphon wants to ensure that the funds are available to satisfy any judgment it may receive due to Sphere’s alleged breach of contract, which has damages amounting to at least $30 million. Sphere is accused of entering into at least four hosting agreements with other providers, violating the exclusivity clause of their agreement with Gryphon. Gryphon's letter requesting permission to file a motion. Source: Hogan Lovells/Gryphon.Behind the pre-motion letter lies Sphere’s financial health. According to Gryphon’s letter based on Sphere’s annual report to the Securities and Exchange Commission, the company has publicly acknowledged its potential for bankruptcy, suggesting it may not be able to satisfy future judgments.“Over the last four months, Sphere has revealed its growing financial troubles. On November 28, 2023, in a filing in the Core Bankruptcy Action, Sphere’s counsel acknowledged that the company was operating with a $200 million net loss and that recent losses had overtaken revenue by a two-to-one margin,” reads the letter. According to Sphere’s latest earnings report from March 13, the company’s net loss for 2023 was $23.4 million, compared to $192.8 million the previous year, as the crypto winter hit miners. The companies have been partners since August 2021 and even considered merging under the Gryphon brand. However, in April 2023, Sphere first sued Gryphon after an alleged spoofing attack led to the irregular transfer of Bitcoin.In January 2023, Gryphon CEO Rob Chang was allegedly scammed into sending 18 Bitcoin (BTC) to a spoofing attacker posing as Sphere 3D’s chief financial officer. A few days later, eight more BTC were sent to the same address. At the time, Gryphon claimed to be a victim of Sphere’s “gross negligence” that allowed activities from malicious actors.In addition to dismissing allegations related to the transfer of assets, Gryphon has filed claims against Sphere 3D for breach of contract, negligence, and defamation. The partnership was terminated in October 2023. Cointelegraph reached out to Sphere 3D, but did not receive an immediate response.Magazine: MakerDAO’s plan to bring back ‘DeFi summer’ — Rune Christensen

Digital Asset Management Giant Grayscale Rolls Out New Actively Managed Investment Product Focused on Staking - The Daily Hodl


								Crypto asset manager Grayscale is launching a new product focused on income from staking rewards.
In a new announcement, Grayscale says that it is launching the Grayscale Dynamic Income Fund (GDIF), a new actively managed investment product that aims to earn profits from the staking rewards of proof-of-stake (PoS) crypto assets.










 “GDIF is our first actively managed investment product. It seeks to optimize income in the form of staking rewards associated with proof-of-stake digital assets.” 
According to Grayscale’s website, the GDIF works by investing customer funds into tokens of PoS blockchains that earn rewards. They would then be cashed out and distributed accordingly. Grayscale also says it would rebalance the fund’s holdings as needed to optimize income.
Staked tokens are coins that are used to validate a blockchain’s network transactions and are vital to the infrastructure of a PoS blockchain. Staking requires validators to devote tokens to the network, and in return, they earn rewards.
Grayscale says the GDIF, which was announced earlier this month, will take those rewards, which are paid out in the blockchain’s native asset, and convert them to US dollars.
 “In return for securing the network through the validation of transactions, investors earn staking rewards. Staking rewards are paid in each blockchain’s native token. For GDIF, staking rewards aim to be converted to USD weekly and aim to be paid quarterly to investors.”
The GDIF marks another offering in Grayscale’s expanding suite of institutional-scale crypto products.
In January, the firm added a Bitcoin (BTC) exchange-traded fund (ETF) after a years-long battle with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and is now looking to include a mini BTC Trust and an ETF centered around smart contract platform Ethereum (ETH).

Bitwise CIO Predicts $1 Trillion Inflow into Bitcoin via ETFs, Urges Long-term Perspective Amid Volatility



                    
Matthew Hougan, the Chief Investment Officer at Bitwise, has projected a transformative inflow of funds into Bitcoin from institutional investors through exchange-traded funds (ETFs), forecasting as much as $1 trillion could be funneled into the cryptocurrency. 



In a detailed memo to investment professionals, Hougan tackled the issue of Bitcoin’s volatility, which has seen its value fluctuate between $60,000 and $70,000. 




Despite these short-term swings, he advised a calm and long-term perspective, citing “keep calm and take the long view.”



Hougan pinpointed several pivotal moments on the horizon for Bitcoin, including the anticipated halving event and the approval of spot Bitcoin ETFs on major national platforms such as Morgan Stanley and Wells Fargo. 



He also mentioned the ongoing due diligence processes by investment committees and consultants as an essential preparatory step before they can commit to investing in Bitcoin.




The Bitwise executive suggested that in the interim, Bitcoin’s price might experience sideways movement due to minor shifts in sentiment.

However, he remains optimistic about Bitcoin’s future, asserting that it is part of a “raging bull market,” supported by a 300% increase over the past 15 months and solid reasons to believe in continued growth.



Highlighting the significance of the recent spot Bitcoin ETF approvals in January, Hougan emphasized their role in opening the cryptocurrency market to investment professionals. 



He outlined the gradual but inevitable shift of investment professionals, who manage trillions of dollars, towards cryptocurrencies, stressing that this transition is expected to unfold over years rather than months.



Hougan celebrated the remarkable success of ETFs, which have seen an inflow of $12 billion since their inception, marking them as the “most successful ETF launch of all time.” 



Yet, he views this as just the beginning, with the potential for a massive $1 trillion influx once global wealth managers allocate a mere 1% of their portfolios to Bitcoin. 



He concluded, “A 1% allocation across the board would mean ~$1 trillion of inflows into the space. Against this, $12 billion is barely a down payment.”

Google Expands AI Capabilities to Pixel 8 Despite RAM Constraints

In big news from Google, the company revealed that it’s bringing its Gemini Nano AI model to Pixel 8 devices, putting them at the crossroads of mobile AI technology. Some of the roadblocks that lay on the road before integration started were the hardware specs of the device—in this case, the availability of RAM. This article unpacks the road toward this decision, the implications for users, and developers of the platform, and the wider effects on smartphone capabilities.Overcoming hardware limitations This marked the entry of the Gemini AI model earlier in the year on some mobile devices and presented a leap toward embedding advanced AI capabilities directly into smartphones. The initial exclusion, however, of Pixel 8 from the rollout, in the first few updates, brought with it some suspicion related to the hardware limitations of the device.The Vice President of Devices and Services Software at Google, Seang Chau, had a candid discussion about the limitations that came to light during the Made by Google podcast. He singled out the difference in the RAM between the Pixel 8 Pro, which had 12 GB, and the 12 GB of the standard Pixel 8 model, which was to come with 8 GB as one of the factors that would have decided against Google’s position on the same.The company has recently announced that it will be opening up Gemini Nano to developers in an upcoming software update on the Pixel 8. The move signals Google’s commitment to expanding the reach of AI capabilities across its device ecosystem, with the caveats that may limit its appeal to the average user. It purports to be the trade-offs on-device AI makes. Notably, adding Gemini Nano to Pixel 8 devices as a developer feature is clear evidence of the complex trade-offs going on in making use of cutting-edge AI models on smartphones.As Chau’s insight revealed, Google envisions AI features as “RAM resident,” meaning the features have to be instantly available for use. On the other end, this needs constant availability in memory on the device for such an application to be running full-time, something that might hinder others from running to their optimum on the device. The fact that Google is willing to ship with this integration anyway, despite the latter case explicitly degrading performance, really speaks volumes to Google’s commitment to further pushing the boundaries of what it is possible to do with mobile AI. They will have to do so because the more capable AI would justify a device that, on average, does not be as smooth.Implications for developers and usersFor developers, Google’s announcement opens new avenues for innovation. The developer option makes available a new generation of AI-powered mobile experiences accessible. The access to the power of Gemini Nano through the developer option allows building apps that will leverage the capabilities of this model and have the potential. However, the impact on the average Pixel 8 user remains to be seen.However, the option to enable Gemini Nano starts to show just what the future of mobile technology might be; its practical benefits are liable to whatever user might not want to fiddle around with developer settings. While Google told Ars Technica it now has neither the Pixel 8 nor the Pixel 8 Pro keeping Gemini in memory by default and that the developer flag needs to be turned on, it is a cautious approach for this roll-out.This is what makes sure that the introduction of on-device AI does not compromise the Google user experience by empowering them to be in control of the balance between innovation and usability. The future of mobile AIGoogle has recently tested combining its Gemini Nano with the Pixel 8, part of a wave in the technology industry to make AI more mobile device-friendly. It will boost not only smartphones but will set a hallmark for the integration of modern AI models into consumer electronics. As technology evolves, so do the expectations for smartphones to be able to perform many and many more sophisticated tasks without trading off their performance. The initiative by Google with Gemini Nano on Pixel 8 devices moves toward such expectations, obviously considering the due considerations for the hardware and the user experience. In this light, the extension of Gemini Nano to users of Pixel 8 is an outstanding leap and demonstrates greater possibilities with the development of mobile AI. Still, some bottlenecks exist and make it nearly impossible for advanced AI models to operate effectively within the hardware constraints. Such developments indeed promise to continue beaming toward the future of smartphone technology.

Solana price prediction as mysterious whale moves $332 million worth of SOL


Backed by the general crypto market gains and increasing investor interest in meme coins launched on the Solana (SOL) blockchain, the network’s native token has registered stellar performance in the current rally.
Indeed, SOL investors are anticipating the next price movement that could pave the way for a potential record high above the $200 mark, as the community remains super bullish.
Notably, the growth in SOL prices has coincided with a significant on-chain movement of the token. Particularly, data provided by Whale Alert on March 29 indicates that 1,757,028 SOL tokens worth approximately $332 million were moved between unknown wallets.



It’s worth noting that the significant transfer of SOL tokens has the potential to impact the valuation of the token in either direction. For instance, in cases where there are large movements of selling, it increases the supply, potentially lowering prices, while holding reduces the supply, potentially raising prices. 
What next for Solana?
When looking at the next Solana price, besides the whale activity, the token is influenced by several elements. Currently, SOL is consolidating below the $200 mark, with a section of analysts pointing out that the token can potentially move in either direction.
Particularly, crypto trading analyst Trading Shot pointed out that SOL can potentially retrace to $155 or hit a new record high of $310. His projection is based on technical analysis, where he observed that SOL was trading within a triangle pattern in the one-day time frame.
In the March 29 analysis, he pointed out that the one-day moving average (MA) of 50 has provided consistent support since late September 2023, with only a brief break occurring for four days in late January 2024 during the previous similar channel-up phase.

“That Channel Up also formed a Triangle half-way through and when the price broke to the upside, it peaked on its 1.5 Fibonacci extension. As a result, we will buy in case a similar bullish break-out takes place and target $310. If the Triangle breaks to the downside first though, we will short and target the 1D MA50 at $155,” he said.

In the meantime, Solana is likely to be swayed by activities related to the collapsed FTX crypto exchange. Notably, the management of the bankrupt trading platform will sell its balance of 41 million in Solana to institutional investors at around a $60 discount. Indeed, SOL is likely to be swayed once the tokens hit the market.
Solana outshines Ethereum
Furthermore, on-chain metrics point to a bullish Solana price outlook. Specifically, data from the blockchain analytics platform Artemis indicates that as of March 30, Solana’s weekly transfer volume for stablecoins surged to $364.7 billion, surpassing Ethereum’s (ETH) reported volume of $152.99 billion.
 Crypto weekly transfer volume for stablecoins. Source: Artemis
This metric bodes well with Solana’s aspiration to emerge as a possible competitor to Ethereum as a decentralized finance (DeFi) platform.
Elsewhere, it will also be interesting to monitor how the upcoming Solana Saga smartphone will play out. The token’s rally was partly attributed to the demand for the first version of the device, which has been touted as crypto-friendly.
SOL’s bearish fundamentals 
Additionally, Solana faces several headwinds regarding its potential march to a new all-time high. For instance, the network has faced perennial concerns about outages that might deter developers.
At the same time, with the meme coins launched on the platform acting as key catalysts, there is a call for caution, considering that such tokens typically have no underlying fundamentals and are likely to see corrections.
Meanwhile, by press time, Solana was trading at $196 with daily gains of almost 7%. On the weekly chart, SOL is up 12%.

Whale investments mark a turning point for Bitcoin's future

Bitcoin‘s shark group has dominated the market with over 268,000b BTC in only a few weeks since their major participation in 2012. Among this group, which would be named entities with threshold values of $6.93 million to $69.3 million (0.010-1.000 BTC) in their account, a much bigger impact can be seen; nonetheless, they still show a weaker influence than the larger whales who hold more than 1000 BTC. Bitcoin sharks’ recent moves manifesting a bullish outlook on the cryptocurrency might just ring the bells for the cryptocurrency market entrepreneurs and investors, predicting a new era of growth in the cryptocurrency market.Bitcoin sharks set record accumulation amid market volatilityThe behavior of on-chain sharks used in Bitcoin by a watchdog firm, Glassnode, is quantified through the net position change indicator, as shown by the data. All those Bitcoin that either comes into or goes out of the wallets of those entities belonging to this net group are the basis of this indicator for a given time. A scrutiny of the data shows that the increase in the accumulated bitcoins by the sharks, which stands at about 268,441 BTC, resulted in almost $18.6 billion in investment at the current market values. Through this fact, the crucial epoch of allocation for this category of people during the last decade was notably substantial and outstripped the records in both volume and net capital.Notably, this attrition episode disturbs ripple effects in every aspect. It is an appreciation of a strong belief that the Bitcoin value will be high in the distant moment. This means that the investors now consider lower prices attractive in their positions. Besides, it may also be considered a signal of a broader sentiment shift among major market participants, providing the ground for possible upcoming price growth. The analysts follow closely on such trends as the actions of the large institutional buyers, which often give a clue on what may happen ahead in the market. The shark’s recent activity undoubtedly gets the attention of the analysts.Investment implications as well as prospects.It is not only their collective size but also the intentionality of the sharks that pose a danger to the salmon population. At this time, the medium-term bullish indicator shows a simultaneous increase in trading activity and an influx of positive price action for Bitcoin, which has turned the charts in favor of the bulls. More so, an uptick in activity in cryptocurrency exchange platforms such as Coinbase, with the daily withdrawal of $1.1 billion of Bitcoin, is another positive sign for the market. They usually mean that investors tend to take long-term positions, standing the chance of the future price rising, neglecting exchanges, and opting for self-custody that is not risky.But at the same time, the similar frame also has two sides of the coin: the miners are facing the predicaments of Bitcoin halving upcoming and its consequences in the mining world. However, what can be said about the attitude of most big investors, as shown by sharks’ cooperation, is positive, and they believe in the bright future of cryptocurrency.Whale buys signal upcoming growth waveBitcoin price remains valiant as it has stayed close to $69,400 in recent days’ trade. The caution that short-term movements come part and parcel of the cryptocurrency market is shadowed by the confidence the sharks have in Bitcoin’s value proposition, which is the prevailing sentiment. Following a buying blitz of this type, it is almost a given that attention will be drawn to where the other investors decide to settle and to see what this is if it is urged by a new growth wave for the number one cryptocurrency.The recent whale wallet buying spree, signaling an optimistic period for Bitcoin, is a whale-sized appetizer for future events. Such developments that include a tremendous surge in the inflow of capital and a major strategy change of investors to invest in long-term funds would be able to provide vital information on the cautiousness of the market and the probable future directions. The Bitcoin story remains fascinating to watch unfold as it attracts more and more market developments and the behavior of the key players who, traditionally, the investors and the analysts follow closely going forward.

Renewable Energy and Thermal Management Companies Poised to Benefit from AI Boom

The AI paradox (which is to say AI is driving the world of technology at an unprecedented pace) has relegated investors to the quest of finding big winners on either side of the AI transformation. Although NVIDIA and Google have been well-known for researching AI, there are more undiscovered companies that do power management and renewable energy solutions. Such companies will increasingly serve as must-see jewels in the booming market.Renewable energy plan for data centers With the combination of the quantitative growth of AI applications, data centers are experiencing energy consumption that we cannot remember ever before. With AI algorithms’ increased power, companies may need to run programs, and access to reliable and sustainable sources will ultimately be the primary concern. AES Corp (NYSE: Generally, AES is an ideal company with a cutting-edge technology positioning to exploit the advantages of new technologies.In 2023, AES reached a record high with over 5.6 gigawatts of new power purchase agreements (PPAs) signed, the majority being served by technology giants interested in getting renewable energy solutions as the only viable solution for the green environment.AES’s investment in renewable energy, including hourly match renewable energy, has displayed the company’s dedication to clean resources, and its products have attracted the world’s largest tech companies, such as Google, Amazon, and Meta. These organizations have committed themselves to carbon-free or renewable energy objectives by 2030, providing A.E.S.’s products with a significantly attractive market.AES’s development pipeline has been expanded by more than 50 Gigawatts, and the company has secured advanced interconnection queue positions in the most important energy markets in the US. Hence, the company can fully satisfy the growing energy demands of the technology sector and will be able to assert its position in the market. Since the world’s data centers are trying to achieve their sustainability targets, AES becomes the ideal partner because it is ready to benefit from the infrastructure of the AI-driven applications that the need is growing.Leading the charge in thermal management solutionsIn line with the ever-increasing energy needs of AI data centers, the value of prompt thermal management systems has never been higher. Vertiv, a pioneer in the thermal management of data centers, has an edge through proven advanced technology and excellent operational resilience.A positive consequence of stock movement direction can be observed through Vertiv’s stock price, which increased by 252% in 2023, highlighting investors’ trust in the company and its value creation. To its credit, the company aims to maintain good customer relations, develop technologies ahead of the game, and achieve flawless operational performance, which are invariably a must in the AI-driven growth of the market. Recently, Vertiv has achieved another strategic move, the acquisition of CoolTera, which has widely expanded its specialization into high-density and liquid cooling technologies, which are imperative to the AI data centers facing massive data computations and heat generation challenges.When The company has some capacity expansions underway and a strong order basis, entering 2024, Vertiv will fulfill the surging needs for advanced cooling solutions in AI infrastructure environments. The company is found to be blazing forward in the field owing to its coupled high-density liquid cooling solutions, which are unmatched in the industry as a step towards GPU-accelerated computing.Navigating the volatility of AI-driven marketEven though AI increases offer huge highs to investors, they also carry the volatility level. Public companies in this space tend to be swinging between high concern about share prices and increasing business results in a new market situation. Hence, diversification and prudent investment strategies will remain at the core of riding the storms in this volatile landscape.Investors seeking investments in the AI excitement should diversify their holdings across companies resembling AES and Vertiv, which are supposed to win in the AI-fully utilized data centers’ growing energy and heat management needs. The opportunities are exciting but come along with risks. Therefore, one must be cautious and seek guidance from financial experts to maximize profitable ventures in this dynamic industry.AI is the major force that alters the pattern of industries and introduces innovations in existing technologies; most of the time, companies that become famous in renewable energy and thermal management solutions assist the infrastructure used in this AI revolution. AES and Vertiv exist in contrast to many companies whose business ways are hindered by the AI revolution. These are examples of companies that are well-placed to capitalize on the AI boom and, as such, are beautiful opportunities for investors to grow at a time when the markets are volatile.

Whale Who Fell Asleep 12 Years Ago Buying Bitcoin at $8 Wakes Up - Here's What It Did - Bitcoin Sistemi


A Bitcoin wallet that has been dormant for nearly 12 years has suddenly become operational. The wallet transferred its entire balance of 500 Bitcoins, worth just under $35 million at current prices, to 284 new wallets.
According to data from Lookonchain, the wallet first received 500 BTC on July 14, 2012, when the Bitcoin price was below $8. At that time, the total value of BTCs was less than $4000.


The identity of the person or organization behind the Bitcoin transfer and the reason for the transfer are unknown.
This mysterious Bitcoin movement follows an even more interesting event earlier this week. In 2010, an individual or organization that received 2,000 Bitcoins as mining rewards combined them into a single wallet.






When these blocks were mined, the rewards were worth approximately $600 in total. Now this amount is worth approximately 140 million dollars.
BTC price is trading at $70,050 at the time of writing and has increased by more than 8% in the last week. Adam Back, one of the two people Satoshi Nakamoto e-mailed, claimed in his statement that an all-time high price level could be seen in BTC this weekend.

MetaMask's Parent Company Pushes SEC for Spot Ethereum ETF - DailyCoin


        
ConsenSys has advocated for the approval of a spot Ethereum ETF with the SEC.



ConsenSys has argued that Ethereum’s PoS system offers stronger security than Bitcoin’s PoW.



ConsenSys has maintained that Ethereum’s security measures are superior to those of already approved Bitcoin ETFs.
The ongoing saga of cryptocurrency exchange-traded funds (ETFs) in the United States has a new chapter. ConsenSys, the company behind the popular crypto wallet MetaMask, has submitted a public comment letter to the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) advocating for the approval of a spot Ethereum ETF.Ethereum Security System Debated for ETFsThis move comes in response to the SEC’s request for public comments issued earlier in March. The SEC is particularly interested in understanding whether Ethereum’s unique security mechanism, Proof-of-Stake (PoS), poses any challenges that could impact the viability of an ETF.ConsenSys argues that Ethereum’s PoS system actually offers superior security compared to Bitcoin’s Proof-of-Work (PoW) system, which is the foundation for already approved Bitcoin ETFs. The letter details how launching a successful attack on the Ethereum network is significantly more expensive and time-consuming compared to Bitcoin.
According to ConsenSys, estimates suggest an attack on Ethereum would cost nearly $34.39 billion (based on December 2023 Ether prices) and take almost six months to execute. In contrast, attacking the Bitcoin network, which primarily relies on computing power and electricity, could cost anywhere between $5 billion to $20 billion and potentially happen much faster.Unveiling Advantages of Ethereum’s PoS SystemBeyond cost, ConsenSys emphasizes several other advantages of Ethereum’s PoS system. These include faster block finality (confirmation of transactions), a decentralized and randomized validation process, and a built-in penalty system for validators who break the network’s rules. 
These features, combined with Ethereum’s energy efficiency and transparent community structure, according to ConsenSys, create a robust network less susceptible to manipulation and fraud.The letter concludes with a strong urge for the SEC to recognize the advanced security measures built into Ethereum’s design. ConsenSys argues that these safeguards not only meet but surpass those found in Bitcoin-based ETFs already approved by the commission.On the Flipside
PoS systems have the possibility of becoming more centralized over time, as a limited number of validators with large stakes could hold significant power.



Regulations around PoS and cryptocurrency in general are still evolving. The SEC’s view on PoS and its suitability for ETFs could change in the future.



There are currently no successful, long-term examples of established ETFs based on PoS cryptocurrencies.
Why This MattersThis push by ConsenSys is the latest development in the ongoing debate surrounding cryptocurrency ETFs in the US. With several Bitcoin ETFs already receiving the green light, the focus now shifts to Ethereum and whether its distinct PoS system will be deemed secure enough for a similar ETF product.Curious about the impact of Ethereum reaching 1 million validators?

Prepping For $100,000: Bitcoin Shark And Whales Spend Over $18 Billion To Buy BTC


                            Almost every Bitcoin investor is anticipating a continued price surge as the crypto continues to trade around the $70,000 price mark. On-chain data has shown a large part of this surge can be attributed to the accumulation by large whales. 
Bitcoin is undoubtedly home to a lot of these whale addresses holding hundreds of millions of dollars and with transactions that can move the market. However, on-chain data has further revealed that the accumulation trend has also flowed into the next cohort of traders. These traders, also known as “Sharks,” are addresses that hold between 100 BTC and 1,000 BTC. According to Glassnode data, shark wallet addresses have accumulated 268,441 BTC in the past 30 days, which is the biggest net position change since 2012. 
Increased Accumulation Of BTC
According to a Glassnode chart shared on social media by crypto analyst James Van Straten, Bitcoin accumulation by shark investors shot up in 2024 to reverse a multi-year consolidation since 2020. As a result, these addresses increased their holdings by 268,441 in 30 days, roughly converting to $18 billion. 

While these sharks do not have as much individual power over price movement as very large whales, their collective behavior is still worth monitoring as they also relate to the sentiment among investors. Consequently, this large accumulation trend could lead to more buying which would signal a continued price surge for Bitcoin.

Source: Glassnode
The surge in accumulation is not really surprising, as the launch of Spot Bitcoin ETFs in the US has ushered in a bigger wave of accumulation sentiment from all cohorts of Bitcoin investors. As another analyst pointed out on social media, this shark accumulation could’ve been due to ETFs purchasing massive amounts of Bitcoins from Coinbase OTC desks.
Bitcoin whales (addresses holding more than 1,000 BTC) have also upped their activity in the past few days, signaling strategic positioning in the market. Various transaction alerts from Whale Alerts have shown strategic movement from whale addresses. 
Notably, the crypto whale transaction tracker has revealed $1.3 billion worth of BTC exchanged between whale addresses in the past 24 hours. Among these large BTC movements was a notable transfer of 3,599 BTC worth $252 million between two unknown wallets. Another notable transaction was the transfer of 3,118 BTC from an unknown wallet to Coinbase Institutional.
Bitcoin To $100,000?
Data from IntoTheBlock has also reiterated this accumulation trend with its net transfer trend from exchanges. Data from ITB’s platform shows a $16.18 billion outflow from exchanges as against a $15.76 billion inflow in the past seven days. Bitcoin is now trading at $67,931 and has failed to stabilize above the $70,000 mark again.

However, the accumulation by whales and sharks, increasing mainstream interest from institutional investors through Spot Bitcoin ETFs, and the approaching halving all point to the possibility of substantial price appreciation to $100,000.

Hong Kong's SFC Issues Warning on Fraudulent Crypto Platform HKCEXP, Encourages Investor Vigilance



                    
The Securities and Futures Commission of Hong Kong (SFC) has issued a warning about a dubious trading platform known as HKCEXP. 



This platform has been misleading investors by claiming affiliation with the regulatory body, despite not being registered with the SFC. 




The alert comes in the wake of the SFC’s announcement that cryptocurrency exchanges operating in Hong Kong had until February 29 to file for a mandatory operational license or cease operations by May 31.



In response to this directive, the SFC received applications from 22 crypto trading platforms, which included four that had previously applied under a voluntary regime. 



However, the challenge of counterfeit entities posing as credible exchanges persists in Hong Kong, with HKCEXP being the latest to deceive investors by falsely proclaiming itself as an “SFC-registered business.”




Further accusations against HKCEXP include providing a fraudulent address in Hong Kong and imposing hefty withdrawal fees, as reported by one of the victims to the SFC.



To combat these fraudulent activities and enhance investor safety, the SFC plans to keep and publicly share a list of crypto platforms awarded operational licenses.

Exchanges that missed the application deadline are now restricted in their operational capabilities and are prohibited from conducting marketing activities within the region.



The issue of impersonation extends beyond HKCEXP. 



The SFC recently uncovered several fake websites mimicking prominent local cryptocurrency exchanges.



These counterfeit sites aimed to deceive investors by emulating the domains of OSL Digital Securities and Hash Blockchain Limited (also known as HashKey), two of the licensed exchanges in Hong Kong.



To protect investors and uphold the integrity of the crypto trading environment, the SFC encourages the public to consult its official register. 



This includes a list of licensed persons and registered institutions, along with a specific directory for licensed virtual asset trading platforms. 



By doing so, investors can access accurate information on licensed entities and their official websites, ensuring they engage with legitimate platforms.

Here Are The Top Crypto Predictions Following The Bitcoin Halving In April 2024


								The Bitcoin Halving event, which will cut miners’ rewards in half, is set to take place in mid-April. Once that happens, the crypto community will have its eyes on specific predictions that have been projected to be actualized after the Halving event. 

Where Is Bitcoin Headed After The Halving?
Crypto analysts have given varying opinions on the future trajectory of the flagship crypto after the Halving takes place. Samson Mow’s prediction stands out from the rest, considering that he believes Bitcoin could rise to $1 million this year. If that is to happen, Bitcoin’s price would have to begin showing tremendous upside post-halving. 
Besides Mow, some other crypto analysts have given bullish price predictions for Bitcoin, although not as ambitious as Mow’s. One of them is Tom Dunleavy, Partner and Chief Investment Officer (CIO), who predicted that Bitcoin would rise to $100,000 after the Halving takes place. 
Tom Lee, Managing Partner and Head of Research at Fundstrat Global Advisors is another person who has high hopes for Bitcoin’s price post-halving. In February, he predicted that Bitcoin could rise to $150,000, thanks partly to the Bitcoin Halving. The common belief among these analysts is that Bitcoin’s supply will shrink, causing its value to appreciate.
On the other hand, some have projected a bearish outlook for Bitcoin after the Halving event. This includes JPMorgan, which has predicted that Bitcoin could drop to as low as $42,000 once the event occurs. They believe this price drop could happen due to increased production costs and mining difficulties. 
In one of his analyses, Crypto expert Rekt Capital also suggested that Bitcoin isn’t exactly going to have a smooth ride up once the Halving takes place. Specifically, he mentioned that Bitcoin would enter a “multi-month re-accumulation” after the Bitcoin Halving, which could last up to five months.

Bitcoin is now trading at $70.134. Chart: TradingView
Altcoins To Keep An Eye On
Solana (SOL) is generating much attention, especially with the meme coin frenzy on the Solana network. This has caused SOL’s price to skyrocket in recent weeks and has increased optimism that it won’t be long before it surpasses its all-time high (ATH) of $260. Moreover, crypto analysts like Jake Gagain have predicted that the crypto token will still rise to as high as $750. 
The crypto community will also be monitoring ADA closely. Before now, Dan Gambardello, the founder of Crypto Capital Venture, had explained that ADA historically lags for a while before it eventually takes off in the bull run. Gambardello had also predicted that ADA would begin its run to $11 once the Halving takes place.  

XRP, like ADA, has had an unimpressive price action despite the broader crypto market enjoying significant gains year-to-date (YTD). However, with crypto analyst Egrag Crypto predicting that XRP could rise to $27, the token will be another altcoin to keep an eye on post-Halving.

AI-Powered Application in Development to Detect Tuberculosis in Kenya

In a radical move, scientists at the Kenya Medical Research Institution (KEMRI) are leading the proactive invention of a computerized application where AI can diagnose tuberculosis (TB) and other respiratory disorders. The project will be headed by Dr. Videlis Nduba and his fellow healthcare professionals who are pushing for a revolution in healthcare technology. This can considerably positively impact TB cases’ diagnostic and treatment outcomes.Innovative approach to TB diagnosisAt KEMRI, the researchers take up the task of patiently collecting cough samples from both the people who have and have not got diseases of the respiratory system, including cases of tuberculosis. Subsequently, they analyze the sound of coughing taken by science devices like smartphone microphones. The software is designed to differentiate coughs resolving without TB from those comorbid with TB infections via a machine-learning approach powered by ResNet 18, a technology pioneered at the University of Washington.Dr. Nduba advocates for intense confirmation of TB diagnosis and its profound effect on TB treatment. The problem is that at present, the time from the appearance of symptoms to diagnosis varies from several months to 1 year, and customers with such disease can still infect others while the illness goes undetected. The AI app detects TB cases swiftly; thus, the patients receive immediate treatment, thereby helping to bring transmission rate inoculation to a significant extent.Striving for accuracy and regulatory approvalNevertheless, even in its premature stage, the system has proven effective and has yet to be approved by the World Health Organization (WHO). According to the WHO, at least 90% of TB infections must be detected, and at least 80% of the likelihood of having TB could be ruled out. The pilot implementation resulted in the detection of 80% of tuberculosis cases and the rate of 70% for excluding the disease from the list of possible causes, so the improvement of the technology in the trade-off line with WHO recommendations is required.Johnson Munori, a former TB patient, was part of immunotherapy. In contrast, the latter is based on molecular medicine, in which the anticancer drugs are designed based on mutations. Thus, the effectiveness of these two treatments varies depending on factors such as tumor type, stage, and mode of delivery. His expertise emphasizes the role of the creativity approach as a key to providing realistic solutions for overcoming infectious diseases.AI is a rapidly rising and hearable factor in medical health. According to Jarim Omogi, a public health specialist at Amref International University, can fasten the nursing of patients. Omogi’s call for treatment affordability and cost-effectiveness, while AI is paramount, is an eye-opener, and data provision is time-sensitive, showcasing AI integration in healthcare practice.The project, funded by the National Institutes of Health (NIH), is projected to effect a paradigm shift in diagnosing TB, thus managing the disease. Yet, this communication tool has not received regulatory approval, revealing the importance of prudential evaluation and implementation of the existing rules before its use.

This is Why SEC and Ripple Might End in a Legal Showdown


On March 29, Ripple senior executives held a settlement conference with the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) officials, fueling rumors about a potential case resolution between the entities.
Trending photographs on social media platform X (formerly Twitter) showed Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse and Chief Legal Officer Stuart Alderoty outside the federal courthouse in New York.
Is Ripple Settling With the SEC?
The trending images, alongside the court filing, fuelled speculations that the long-standing legal battle might finally be resolved. However, legal experts have cautioned against reading too much meaning into these developments.
Retired securities lawyer Marc Fagel dispelled any notion of an imminent settlement. He clarified that such conferences are standard procedural measures and do not necessarily signal resolved disputes. Typically, these involve discussions devoid of commitments from either party.

“It’s a mandatory pre-hearing settlement conference, part of the original scheduling order. Odds of settlement: about 0%,” Fagel commented.

Meanwhile, a Ripple spokesperson told Fox Business reporter Eleanor Terrett that there was “nothing to share.” This prompted Terrett to suggest that the meeting between the SEC and Ripple could merely be a mandatory meeting preceding the upcoming pretrial conference.
Interestingly, Ripple’s chief legal officer, Stuart Alderoty, criticized the SEC on the same day over its handling of the emerging industry.

“Seven years after the DAO report—which the SEC claims provided clarity to crypto—the SEC is still litigating eight major crypto cases in federal courts with no end in sight. Something’s broken,” he remarked.

Earlier in the week, the SEC disclosed its pursuit of a $2 billion fine against Ripple. The regulator alleged that the firm distributed a substantial amount of XRP in violation of federal securities laws. Moreover, the financial watchdog asserted that it designed the fine to deter similar actions from the crypto industry.

However, Ripple and its executives have vowed to contest these demands. Alderoty said the huge fines were designed to “punish and intimidate” Ripple and that it was not a faithful application of the law.

Wells Fargo Accused of Overcharging Thousands of Customers, Concealing Predatory Practice for More Than 10 Years: New Lawsuit - The Daily Hodl


								A new lawsuit accuses banking giant Wells Fargo of overcharging thousands of customers on credit card interest rates and fees for more than a decade.
The class action lawsuit, filed by plaintiffs Carmin Nowlin, Tamika Haley and Jesus Rodriguez, alleges the bank charged active US military service members interest rates and fees that were above levels set by the Servicemembers Civil Relief Act (SCRA).










The SCRA ensures that any debts a service member incurred before being called to active duty will have their interest rates reduced to 6%. This reduction applies from the date of deployment and lasts throughout the entire period of active duty. Additionally, banks are required to permanently forgive interest over 6%, under the act.
According to the plaintiffs, Wells Fargo specifically marketed itself to service members – particularly those who were being deployed overseas – and quietly overcharged for more than a decade.
“Defendant breached its statutory and contractual duties to America’s fighting forces by charging interest rates and fees that were too high, allowing unlawful charges to improperly inflate servicemembers’ principal balances, and charging compound interest on these inflated balances. Defendant then concealed overcharges from the thousands of military families victimized by Defendant’s practices...
Due to Defendant’s misrepresentations to Plaintiffs and class members and concealment of SCRA violations and overcharges, Plaintiffs and class members did not discover, and had no reasonable opportunity to discover, the SCRA violations until 2022. 
Defendant’s violations at issue were self-concealing, which is evidenced, in part, by the fact that they continued the nationwide practice of overcharging active military servicemembers for more than a decade.”
Wells Fargo has not released a statement on the allegations.
The bank has faced several lawsuits and complaints in recent months, including a customer who says the banking giant left her hanging for seven months after thousands of dollars was stolen from her account.

Solana: How high will SOL prices go in April? - AMBCrypto



Solana flipped MakerDAO in revenue, which consistently held the third spot in recent months.
SOL jumped by more than 50% in the month.

Solana [SOL] ecosystem’s coffers were filled to the brink in March, following increased traffic on its blockchain.
Solana smiles all the way to the bank
The smart contracts network raked in a whopping $31.58 million as of the 30th of March, as per AMBCrypto’s analysis of Token Terminal data, becoming the third-highest revenue generator in the broader Web3 industry.
Source: Token Terminal
Solana flipped lending protocol MakerDAO [MKR], which consistently held the third spot in recent months. Ethereum [ETH] and Tron [TRX] remained the top two revenue generators.
As obvious, the revenue uptick followed an explosion in memecoin trading on the platform. A barrage of coins were minted on the chain one after the other, drawing crypto degens who do not require a second invitation in such instances.
The speculation led to higher number of transactions, in turn generating significant fee revenue for the network.
SOL was one of the top performers in March
The ecosystem’s native token SOL reaped benefits from the blockchain’s increased utilization. The fifth-largest coin jumped by more than 50% in the month, becoming one of the biggest market gainers, according to CoinMarketCap.
Note that Solana burns 50% of its fee revenue, meaning that more the fees collected, more will be the deflationary pressure on SOL.
The price surge also got derivatives traders interested. According to AMBCrypto’s analysis of Coinglass’ data, the Open Interest (OI) in SOL futures increased to $2.74 billion at press time. This marked a 43% increase over the month.
A rising OI accompanied by a rising market value is indicative of a bullish market.

Realistic or not, here’s SOL’s market cap in BTC’s terms

As of this writing, SOL was just 21% shy of its all-time high (ATH) of $249, set in November 2021. Popular crypto commentator Captain Faibik had recently predicted that the new ATH would be hit sometime in April.
If the forecast comes true, it would be some feat for the asset which plunged to $18 during the peak crypto winter of November 2022.

A brief history of TONIn 2018, Telegram CEO Pavel Durov published a white paper for the first layer blockchain of the Telegram Open Network (TON). The idea of the project was to transfer the popular Telegram messenger to TON, to subsequently create the most anonymous and secure application, protected by its own proxy.TON was described as a platform for decentralized applications and services that could be used as an alternative to Visa and MasterCard payment processing services due to its scalability and ability to support millions of transactions per second. The TON blockchain network was designed with specific objectives in mind: flexibility, speed, and cost-effectiveness. These qualities are crucial for attracting millions of users and ensuring integration with messaging applications, which prioritize lightweight functionality. To achieve these goals, TON developers implemented a lightweight consensus algorithm, scalability enhancements such as sharding, and a virtual machine (TVM).Telegram Open Network had unique features including shard chains, a self-healing mechanism, decentralized data storage, domain name service, a TON virtual machine, and built-in privacy tools. The project’s cryptocurrency was called Gram (GRM) and was used for settlements and payment of commissions.To finance the development of the blockchain, Telegram held a private initial coin offering. The ICO, which took place in February-March 2018, was a huge success. In two rounds, the company raised $1.7 billion from investors, selling 44% of the total token issue.In 2020, Telegram, the messaging app giant, terminated its plans for the TON blockchain following a legal battle with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). SEC had filed a lawsuit against Telegram in 2019, alleging that the company violated securities laws by not registering its token, initially named "gram," with the regulatory agency.Crypto wallet and new ads featureIn September 2023, Telegram introduced its long-awaited crypto wallet, built on The Open Network (TON) blockchain, to its 800 million global users. The integration of the TON wallet into Telegram led to a nearly 7% surge in the price of Toncoin upon the announcement.IntoTheBlockThe TON Foundation announced that projects operating on the TON blockchain would receive priority access to Telegram's advertising platform, Telegram Ads. While the wallet feature is currently available in settings for existing users, a global rollout is scheduled to commence in November, excluding the United States and select other countries.Last month, Telegram CEO Pavel Durov revealed plans to launch the company's ad platform, enabling channel owners to earn financial rewards. Rewards will be distributed using Toncoin on the TON blockchain, with channel owners set to receive 50% of all revenue generated from displaying ads in their channels.Despite Telegram channels amassing one trillion monthly views, only 10% of these views are currently monetized with Telegram Ads. The Telegram Ad Platform is slated to open to channel owners in nearly one hundred countries, signaling a significant shift toward content monetization.Toncoin price history and predictionSince its launch, TON hasn’t exactly followed the uptrend, with the price mostly below the initial level in 2022 and 2023.Source: CoinMarketCapIn February, Toncoin embarked on a series of initiatives, demonstrating continued positive momentum. The most recent initiative involved distributing 30 million TON for user participation in ecosystem projects.In late March 2024, Toncoin (TON) surged by 31.83% to $3.68, hitting a two-year high, driven by anticipation of Telegram's upcoming Initial Public Offering (IPO). Trading volumes for TON spiked by 301.96%, reaching $269 million, indicating increased trader interest. IntoTheBlockThese gains were fueled by Telegram Messenger's decision to compensate channel owners with cryptocurrency for ads and Binance's launch of perpetual futures trading for the TON token.In the past month, TON has displayed remarkable resilience, swiftly rebounding from external disruptions like the temporary injunction on Telegram services in Spain. Source: CoinMarketCapDespite the setback, the coin quickly recovered to around $4.90, hinting at the potential for TON to reach the $10 mark. While this milestone remains speculative, optimism is fueled by recent activities within The Open Network and the coin's overall market performance.However, the price is currently in a bearish zone, struggling to break through an important price level. Recent developments, as well as Telegram’s IPO plans, could mean a potential for above $10 level, given the overall bullish market sentiment ahead of Bitcoin halving.

Litecoin Surges by Nearly 20% After US Regulator Refers to LTC as a Commodity in KuCoin Complaint - The Daily Hodl


								Litecoin (LTC) surged by nearly 20% over the past three days after the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) referred to the asset as a commodity in a legal complaint.
On Tuesday, the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) and the CFTC unsealed an indictment against the crypto exchange KuCoin and two of its founders, Chun Gan and Ke Tang.










The DOJ alleges the exchange operated an unlicensed money-transmitting business, failed to maintain an adequate anti-money laundering (AML) program and received over $5 billion worth of suspicious and criminal proceeds.
The CFTC also charged KuCoin with illegally dealing in off-exchange commodity futures transactions, among other alleged violations.
In its complaint, the regulator asserts that certain digital assets are commodities.
“Billing itself as the ‘People’s Exchange,’ KuCoin is a centralized digital asset exchange headquartered in the Republic of Seychelles, the Cayman Islands, and Singapore, with 27 million customers across 200 countries, including the United States, and a cumulative trading volume of $3.6 trillion in 2022. 
During the Relevant Period, KuCoin solicited and accepted orders, accepted property to margin, and operated a facility for the trading of futures, swaps, and leveraged, margined, or financed retail transactions involving digital assets that are commodities including Bitcoin (BTC), Ether (ETH), and Litecoin (LTC).”
The CFTC also referred to those same three crypto assets as commodities in a complaint against Binance last year.
This assertion directly cuts against comments made by U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) Chair Gary Gensler, who in 2023 claimed that every coin besides Bitcoin is a security. Earlier this year, Gensler declined to answer when asked whether ETH counted as a security or a commodity.
LTC is trading at $105.75 at time of writing, up about 20% from $88.40 on Tuesday.

Claude Opus AI predicts DOGE price for the end of 2024


Top meme cryptocurrency, Dogecoin (DOGE), is undergoing a short-term correction following several days of rallying, during which the coin maintained its price above the $0.20 support zone.
From a broader perspective, DOGE’s sustained gains can be considered impressive amidst the ongoing crypto bull run, supported by sustained network development and trading patterns mirroring Bitcoin’s trajectory.
Given the current price movement, a section of the Dogecoin community is eyeing the elusive $1 mark in 2024, particularly anticipating bullish catalysts such as Bitcoin halving. In this context, Finbold consulted Anthropic’s Claude 3 Opus AI platform, a competitor to OpenAI’s ChatGPT in the realm of generative artificial intelligence (AI).


DOGE AI price prediction
According to Claude Opus AI’s analysis, the most likely price range for the end of the year falls between $0.35 and $0.50. The analysis suggests that DOGE could sustain its upward trajectory more moderately.
In the most bullish scenario, the tool projected that Dogecoin could surge to $0.75 to $1.00 by the end of 2024, should the broader cryptocurrency market witness a significant bull run. At the same time, the AI tool pointed out that with possible increased mainstream adoption, DOGE could see its value near the $1 mark.
It is worth noting that Dogecoin has found utility in various sectors, including payments, and its association with Tesla (NASDAQ: TSLA) CEO Elon Musk suggests potential additional use cases. In this regard, there are expectations that Dogecoin might be integrated into the X Payments system by the social media giant X (formerly Twitter) following Musk’s acquisition.
However, in the event of a market correction or a shift in investor sentiment, the tool pointed out that Dogecoin might experience a retracement. Nonetheless, Claude Opus AI’s analysis indicates that DOGE will likely trade at a minimum range of $0.15 to $0.20 for the remainder of 2024.

DOGE’s increasing activity 
Meanwhile, Dogecoin’s recent rally has coincided with increased network activity. For instance, the number of Dogecoin holders now stands at approximately 7 million. This surge in numbers is partly due to the token’s valuation and the Dogecoin Foundation’s rollout of GigaWallet v1.0. The wallet seeks to enable businesses to integrate Dogecoin payments seamlessly through API integration.
Dogecoin’s bullish momentum will likely continue, especially with the news that Coinbase (NASDAQ: COIN)  plans to list DOGE futures products starting April 1. This development coincides with a period when Dogecoin witnessed increased whale transactions. 
Data shared by crypto analyst Ali Martinez on March 29 indicated a significant whale accumulation of the meme coin over the past two weeks, with total purchased tokens amounting to approximately 280 million. These indicators suggest potential price growth for DOGE in the near future.

By press time, DOGE was trading at $0.199, which had been corrected by over 7% in the last 24 hours. However, in the past seven days, DOGE is up almost 15%.

Influencer declares war on AI crypto; Community fights back


The well-known crypto influencer, Eric Wall, has raised thoughtful criticisms over the new hyped artificial intelligence (AI) cryptocurrency, Bittensor (TAO). Its community, however, surged in disapproval.
On March 29, Eric Wall made a long post on X (formerly Twitter) explaining how Bittensor’s AI system works. The influencer mentioned TAO’s “spectacular uselessness” through the different subnets and their mining mechanisms that reward miners with the token.
Using the ‘Subnet 1’ for text prompts as an example, Wall highlights a “redundant” work. In his explanation, all miners will run the “exact same task,” and will validate each other outputs according to their similarities.


Therefore, the network excludes all outliers from the reward, while paying everyone with a similar answer. This, in Eric’s opinion, creates incentives to miners simply copying the first broadcasted output, to increase the mining profitability.

Common users still can’t interact with Bittensor’s crypto AI
Additionally, the post brings to light the issue that common users still can not interact with Bittensor’s Subnet 1. In particular, only people running a node can prompt and use the crypto AI system.
On that note, Eric Wall slams that this system is simply a way for miners to feed each other with random prompts, that they give the same responses while farming the issued TAO tokens as rewards.
However, for this to be a profitable endeavor, the cryptocurrency market must be willing to pay a high price for TAO. In this context, Wall continues his criticism mentioning what looks like an overbought $10 billion market cap “useless” asset.
According to the post, this looks like a non-sustainable long-term economic model, which Eric wants to see priced at $0.00.

Such harsh criticisms have fueled a determined community to unite and defend the AI crypto project they are invested in. Among the supporters, Dr. Martin Hiesboeck slammed Eric’s post as “one of the most misinformed, ignorant post about TAO ever written,” calling it “hilariously dumb.”

In the original post, another community member linked a front end for common users to interact with Bittensor. Nevertheless, Eric explained that the app does not integrate Subnet 1.

“You fundamentally do not understand what you’re looking at. This is just a centralized LLM.”

As the polemic develops, investors of this trending crypto AI can access a different perspective and make their conclusions.
All in all, learning how to filter the information available is fundamental to thriving in the cryptocurrency landscape. Investors must be able to meet different perspectives and challenge their biases while researching trending projects like TAO.

Blockchain PR Agency - Imperium Comms Review



                    
Imperium Comms is a leading blockchain PR agency that offers media coverage and press release distribution. 



Blockchain technology, the backbone of cryptocurrencies and a plethora of decentralized applications, has evolved from a niche interest to a mainstream topic of discussion. As the blockchain ecosystem expands, the need for effective public relations (PR), search engine optimization (SEO), and marketing strategies specifically tailored to this innovative technology has become increasingly vital. These strategies not only help projects gain visibility in a crowded market but also build trust and credibility in an industry that is still regarded with skepticism by many.




Blockchain PR Agencies



Public relations in the blockchain space is about more than just generating buzz; it’s about educating and engaging with a diverse audience, from tech enthusiasts to skeptical observers. The complexity of blockchain technology and its implications mean that effective PR must simplify the complex, making the technology accessible and appealing to a broad audience. Crafting clear, transparent, and informative messages that demystify the technology while highlighting its benefits is key. Furthermore, due to the fast-paced nature of the blockchain industry, staying ahead of trends and being able to rapidly respond to market changes is crucial for maintaining relevance and authority.



SEO for Blockchain



Search engine optimization for blockchain projects requires a nuanced approach. Given the highly technical subject matter and the rapidly evolving landscape, SEO strategies must be built on thorough keyword research that not only captures the current trends but also anticipates future developments. Content is king in the blockchain space, where education and information are highly sought after. Creating high-quality, informative content that addresses the needs and questions of the target audience can dramatically improve a project’s visibility and search rankings. Additionally, since the blockchain community is highly active on specific forums and social media platforms, such as Reddit and Twitter, incorporating social signals into SEO strategies can also enhance visibility and engagement.



Marketing Strategies



Marketing within the blockchain industry demands creativity and innovation. The target audience for blockchain projects is diverse, encompassing tech-savvy individuals, investors, businesses, and casual observers. Tailoring messages to each segment, using the right mix of digital and traditional marketing channels, is essential. Influencer marketing, in particular, has shown significant effectiveness in this space, given the community-driven nature of blockchain projects. Collaborations with respected figures in the blockchain community can lend credibility and attract a loyal following. Additionally, leveraging the power of community through social media platforms and forums can create a sense of belonging and loyalty among users.



Imperium Comms – Blockchain PR Agency Review



Imperium Comms is a highly ranked blockchain PR agency that was founded in 2019 by Suliman Mulhem.



This PR agency offers a broad range of services, such as crypto press release writing and distribution, SEO, and earned media coverage in sites like Bloomberg, CoinDesk, and TechCrunch.

"Bitcoin Price Could Easily Increase 10-Fold in 10 Years," Says Mark Yusko, Reveals Peak Price Prediction for BTC This Year - Bitcoin Sistemi


Morgan Creek Capital Management CEO and Chief Investment Officer Mark Yusko predicts Bitcoin will more than double this year to $150,000. In an interview on CNBC's “Fast Money,” Yusko urged investors to “get off the ground” and allocate at least 1% to 3% of their portfolios to Bitcoin.
“Bitcoin is the king. It is the most dominant token. It is a better form of gold,” said Yusko, emphasizing the potential of BTC.


Yusko believes the “law of large numbers” will come into play and predicts that Bitcoin could easily increase tenfold over the next decade. He cites the launch of Bitcoin ETFs in January as a key bullish factor for BTC.

Yusko also expects the upcoming Bitcoin halving to cause a supply shock, resulting in another major upside for the largest cryptocurrency. The halving, which cuts the Bitcoin mining reward in half to limit supply, is expected to occur at the end of April.





“The big move will happen after the halving,” Yusko explained and added:
“It starts to become more parabolic towards the end of the year. “And historically about nine months after the halving, around Thanksgiving and Christmas, we see the peak in prices before the next bear market.”

Letter from Metamask Developer Company to SEC: "Recognize Ethereum's Superior Attributes to Bitcoin" - Bitcoin Sistemi


Consensys, the blockchain and web3 software development company behind the famous MetaMask wallet, has called on the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to consider Ethereum's superior qualities over Bitcoin when evaluating applications for spot Ethereum ETFs.
The SEC had requested information on whether Ethereum's proof-of-stake (PoS) consensus mechanism raises “unique concerns” about fraud and manipulation. In response, Consensys sent a comment letter to the regulator, stating that such concerns were “completely unfounded”.


In a blog post, Consensys explained that Ethereum's PoS system not only meets but exceeds the security of Bitcoin's Proof of Work (PoW) system, which forms the basis for Bitcoin-based ETFs approved for trading by the SEC.
The company claimed that Ethereum has several advantages over Bitcoin. According to the statement, Ethereum features faster block finalization than the Bitcoin network and separation of duties between bidders and participants, which helps prevent large-scale investor control. It also has a higher attack cost than Bitcoin, penalizes validators who violate protocol rules, and is more environmentally friendly than Bitcoin.






Consensys also argued that Ethereum's active developer community is larger than Bitcoin's and that its blockchain is fully public and transparent.
“We urge the SEC to recognize the advanced security measures built into Ethereum's design,” Consensys wrote, adding:


“These measures not only meet but exceed exemplary security and resilience measures underlying Bitcoin-based ETPs previously approved by the SEC.”

Ripple vs SEC Settlement Talks Held, But Long Road Likely Ahead - DailyCoin


        
A settlement conference has been held between Ripple and the SEC, but details have remained undisclosed.



The potential for a lengthy trial has arisen as Ripple refutes the SEC’s hefty penalty demands.



The SEC’s disagreement over XRP’s security ruling could complicate matters further.
A glimmer of hope flickered for XRP holders today as Ripple Labs convened with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) in a court-mandatory settlement conference. However, recent developments suggest a swift resolution to the long-running legal battle may still be a ways off.Ripple and SEC Explore Settlement OptionsPublic records confirmed the occurrence of a scheduled settlement conference, raising speculation of a potential breakthrough. While Ripple declined to comment on the specifics of the meeting, some experts believe it could be a procedural formality leading up to the trial.This mandated conference stems from a previous order by Judge Analisa Torres, requiring both parties to dedicate at least an hour to exploring settlement possibilities. However, the high stakes involved cast a shadow over any immediate optimism. 
The SEC reportedly seeks over $2 billion in penalties from Ripple, a figure the company deems excessive and intended to cripple innovation within the cryptocurrency space.Ripple is expected to file a formal response next month, signifying the legal road ahead is likely to be lengthy. Appeal Looming After Judge’s XRP Ruling?Further muddying the waters, journalist Charles Gasparino of Fox Business suggests the SEC might appeal Judge Torres’s prior decision regarding the security classification of XRP, a ruling that favored Ripple.
With both parties seemingly gearing up for a protracted legal fight, the future trajectory of the Ripple vs. SEC case remains shrouded in uncertainty. The outcome of this landmark case has the potential to significantly impact the broader cryptocurrency industry, particularly concerning regulatory clarity surrounding digital assets.On the Flipside
The SEC’s pursuit of a high penalty could be seen as a negotiating tactic, not a definitive stance against settlement.



An appeal by the SEC regarding XRP’s security classification, if true, could prolong the case significantly.
Why This MattersDespite the settlement conference, the combative stances from both Ripple and the SEC, coupled with the potential SEC appeal, indicate a prolonged legal battle. This extended litigation period keeps the regulatory status of XRP and potentially other cryptocurrencies in limbo, hindering future innovation and investment within the crypto space.The SEC may struggle to prove individual investor losses, potentially reducing the penalty for Ripple Labs.

Litecoin Soars Past $105 - Is LTC Set For Epic Rally This April?


                            Litecoin (LTC), the “silver” to Bitcoin’s “gold,” has surged in recent weeks, buoyed by a combination of technical factors, strong investor interest, and strategic accumulation by miners.
The LTC price jumped 12% in the past 24 hours, reaching $106.40. This uptick follows a 40% year-to-date gain, with most of the growth concentrated in the last week. Daily trading volume has also skyrocketed by 175%, indicating a significant influx of investors into the Litecoin market.
Will April Be A Good Month For Litecoin?
Analysts are particularly excited by a potential breakout from a multi-year downtrend. If LTC can maintain its position above $94, some believe it could usher in a new era of sustained growth.
A decisive break and hold above the $122 resistance level could trigger further gains, with some analysts predicting a surge towards $150 or even higher. This price pattern mirrors a successful breakout observed in 2020/2021, adding fuel to the bullish fire.

Popular crypto analyst Rekt Capital has also chimed in, noting the historical significance of similar price breakouts for LTC. He believes a successful retest of the downtrend and subsequent establishment of support could be indicative of a promising uptrend for the cryptocurrency.

Miners Fueling The Rally
One of the key drivers behind the recent surge is the behavior of Litecoin miners. Data from IntoTheBlock reveals that miners have been accumulating LTC at a healthy pace throughout March. They’ve added a whopping 150,000 LTC to their reserves, bringing their total holdings to 2.2 million.
This accumulation strategy reduces the selling pressure of newly minted coins and signals the miners’ confidence in the future price trajectory of LTC.

Total crypto market cap is currently at $2.573 trillion. Chart: TradingView
Open Interest On The Rise



The Road Ahead
Litecoin could be headed to a strong April performance, with strong technical indicators and bullish sentiment driving the current rally. However, responsible investors should always conduct their own research and exercise caution when navigating the ever-turbulent world of cryptocurrency.

Online Pirated Streaming Content Witnesses Surge in Crypto Payments Between 2019 and 2023: Chainalysis - The Daily Hodl


								Crypto assets are increasingly being used to pay for pirated online streaming content, according to the blockchain analysis firm Chainalysis.
Nordic Content Protection (NCP), a television anti-piracy non-profit, partnered with Chainalysis to track crypto addresses connected to illicit streaming.










Total inflows to these addresses totaled approximately $24 million between 2019 and 2023, with a dramatic uptick beginning in early 2022 and continuing through 2023.
Michael Lund, NCP’s security manager, tells Chainalysis that the tracked addresses don’t represent the full scope of the problem.
“Television piracy is a global challenge and a significant threat in Europe, the Middle East, Asia, and the Americas. We estimate that the number of users of illicit streaming services is in the hundreds of millions, leading to billions in lost revenue for legitimate services. This, in effect, leads to less tax revenue, fewer jobs, and poorer quality of content.”
Chainalysis noted earlier this year that overall illicit crypto transaction volume fell in 2023 for the first time since 2020. Last year, illicit addresses received $24.2 billion worth of crypto, compared to $39.6 billion in 2022.
In 2020, illicit wallets received only $9.4 billion worth of crypto. That number rose to $23.2 billion in 2021.
The blockchain analysis firm does caution that the actual volume in 2023 may be higher since only known illicit addresses were accounted for.

Indonesian Graduate Turns Memecoin Craze into $1.8 Million Venture with Hybrid NFT Project



                    
In an astonishing venture into the digital asset world, Sultan Gustaf Al Ghozali, an Indonesian college student, has once again captured the attention of the cryptocurrency community by securing $1.8 million from a memecoin presale. 



This achievement follows his initial success in 2022 when he earned a million dollars by selling non-fungible tokens (NFTs) of his daily selfies over five years, a project dubbed “Ghozali Everyday.” 




Ghozali, who had recently graduated, humorously remarked on X that his fortune came from the “stupidest idea” he ever had, signaling his exit from the selfie NFT scene.



However, with the resurgence of interest in memecoins, Ghozali reentered the spotlight by announcing a novel project on March 24 that combines memecoins with NFTs, hosted on the Base blockchain. 



This venture quickly exceeded its funding goal, amassing 527 ETH (approximately $1.8 million), though Ghozali promised refunds to contributors who exceeded the presale’s 400 ETH cap.




The broader crypto market has shown a renewed fascination with memecoins, particularly among Solana traders, leading to a staggering $100 million raised in just three days for various presale projects from March 15 to 18.

The Solana memecoin boom has been met with both excitement and skepticism, the latter due to the lack of assurances for investors in these high-risk ventures.



Meanwhile, the Base blockchain, backed by crypto exchange Coinbase, has seen its total value locked double, suggesting a growing interest in it as a potential hub for memecoin activity following Solana’s lead. 



On March 23, Base reported a TVL of $2.13 billion, hinting at the possible shift of memecoin enthusiasm to its platform.



Despite the speculative nature of memecoins, highlighted by asset manager Franklin Templeton’s cautionary note on their lack of “inherent value or utility,” the trend continues. 



The asset manager conceded that these meme-based tokens could nonetheless yield swift returns for investors, encapsulating the volatile but potentially lucrative allure of cryptocurrency investments.

Will Bitcoin Burst? Demand Outpaces Supply, Liquidity Crisis A Threat


								The Bitcoin market is brewing with anticipation as a confluence of surging demand and dwindling supply threatens to trigger a liquidity crisis. This potential shortage of available Bitcoin comes on the heels of the upcoming halving event, historically a bullish period for the world’s most popular cryptocurrency.

Bitcoin Demand Up?
CryptoQuant, a prominent on-chain data analytics firm, recently revealed a staggering increase in Bitcoin demand. Over the past month, monthly demand skyrocketed from 40,000 BTC to a whopping 213,000 BTC. This meteoric rise is attributed to a perfect storm of factors, including the launch of new Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) and aggressive accumulation by high net worth investors, often referred to as “whales.”


On the other side of the equation, the total circulating supply of Bitcoin has plunged to just 2.7 million coins, the lowest level since the market crash of March 2020. This widening gap between surging demand and contracting supply paints a picture of a potential market squeeze. According to basic economic principles, such a scenario could send Bitcoin’s price significantly higher in the near future.

Total crypto market cap is currently at $2.5 trillion. Chart: TradingView
However, analysts warn that a market starved of liquidity can be a double-edged sword. While it might fuel a price surge, it can also lead to wild price swings in either direction. In an illiquid market, large trades can have an outsized impact on the price, making Bitcoin vulnerable to extreme volatility. This underscores the importance for investors to closely monitor liquidity levels in the coming days.

The Much-Anticipated Halving: How It Will Impact BTC Price
With the halving event less than 20 days away, all eyes are on how this historical price catalyst will play out this time around. The halving refers to a pre-programmed event in Bitcoin’s code that cuts the block reward for miners in half, effectively slowing down the rate at which new Bitcoins are created. This event has historically coincided with bullish periods for Bitcoin, and many investors are eagerly waiting to see if this cycle will hold true.


Popular crypto analysts are offering their insights into Bitcoin’s price trajectory in the face of these converging factors. Analyst Mags predicts that Bitcoin might enter a period of sideways trading near its current all-time high of $70,000. Mags draws a parallel to the 2016 halving cycle, where the price consolidated for roughly 150 days before launching into a historic bull run. Mags views any short-term dips as opportunities for investors to accumulate Bitcoin before a potential parabolic surge.

The coming weeks will be crucial for Bitcoin as it navigates the interplay of surging demand, limited supply, and the impending halving event. While the potential for a liquidity crisis exists, the historical bullish sentiment surrounding the halving suggests a possible breakout for Bitcoin. Investors are advised to tread cautiously and closely monitor market conditions, keeping an eye on both price movements and liquidity levels.

Best Crypto to Buy in 2024: BlockDAG Presale Leads Uniswap Price Prediction and Toncoin Surge with $10.8M Presale Fundraising BlockDAG Presale | Uniswap Price | Toncoin Surge


The digital currency landscape fluctuates due to the tragic event in Russia, Uniswap price prediction, a significant Toncoin surge, and discussions around the best crypto for 2024. These developments mark an uncertain phase in the cryptocurrency market, affecting Uniswap’s robust growth potential, Toncoin’s response to external events, and BlockDAG’s relentlessness as the top buy of 2024. Each of these cryptocurrencies brings unique value propositions and opportunities for investors, from promising price forecasts to pivotal market movements. 






Uniswap Price Forecast: A Bullish Outlook
The Uniswap price prediction is stirring considerable interest in the crypto community, with many analysts offering a bullish outlook. According to the latest Uniswap price prediction, the digital asset will surge by 30.37% to reach $16.22 in just five days, a testament to its growing strength and potential in the market. 
This Uniswap price prediction is bolstered by a significant uptrend in the past month, where it gained 13.09% and a remarkable 117.90% increase over the past year. The current Uniswap price prediction is supported by solid technical indicators and market sentiment, suggesting a promising future. Investors and traders are closely watching the support and resistance levels, as the next few days could be critical for this Uniswap price prediction to materialise amidst the unpredictable nature of the cryptocurrency markets.
The Impact of External Factors on Toncoin’s Surge
Technological advancements and unforeseen geopolitical events have caused the recent Toncoin surge. Following Telegram’s announcement of a potential IPO in the United States, analysts observed a significant Toncoin surge, marking a more than 60% increase in its price within just 48 hours. 





This remarkable upswing demonstrates the cryptocurrency’s growing entwinement with the platform’s ecosystem, particularly as a means for influencers to monetise their content. Furthermore, the terror attack in Moscow, unfortunately, intensified this trend. People flocked to Telegram for real-time updates, inadvertently increasing Toncoin’s visibility and demand. These incidents highlight the volatile nature of cryptocurrency valuations, where both strategic corporate decisions and external socio-political events can dramatically influence market dynamics.
BlockDAG Presale: Turning $1K to $1M
The viral keynote video of BlockDAG is rapidly positioning the project as a leading figure in the cryptocurrency landscape, with projections suggesting a monumental leap in value. Analysts are buzzing about its potential for a staggering 10,000x increase post-launch, setting it up as a dominant force in the digital currency world by 2024. With $10.8 million raised at the price of $0.003 during the Batch 5 presale highlights a golden window for investors seeking to capitalise on what is being touted as the best crypto to buy in 2024. 
This early investment could transform a $1,000 investment into an impressive $15,000 windfall, reflecting the significant advancements expected with each subsequent presale batch. 






BlockDAG distinguishes itself with its ambitious valuation projections and through a structured 45-batch presale strategy designed to democratise investment opportunities. This approach draws a broad spectrum of investors eagerly anticipating the next big breakthrough in the cryptocurrency arena. As BlockDAG gears up for a bull run in 2024, it’s crafting a community-centric platform that primes it for liquidity and vibrant trading scenarios, establishing it as an indispensable asset for enthusiasts looking for substantial returns. 
The anticipation of reaching a $600 million milestone by 2024 underscores the enthusiasm and confidence surrounding BlockDAG as it carves out its niche as an indispensable option for investors.
A Beneficial Comparison
Looking at the latest forecasts for Uniswap and the rise of Toncoin, BlockDAG emerges as the top pick for investors, especially for anyone looking for the best cryptocurrency to invest in for 2024. Expected to grow by 10,000 times after its launch, BlockDAG’s potential growth far outshines Uniswap and the unpredictable gains of Toncoin. 
Thanks to its unique presale approach and focus on community, BlockDAG offers the chance for higher returns and a stable and forward-looking investment option. This positions BlockDAG as an investment for those wanting to enhance their cryptocurrency portfolio.

Investment Advisory Firm Manager Suggests Fed May Raise Interest Rates - Bitcoin Sistemi


In the latest session of CNBC's 'Fast Money', Richard Bernstein's Michael Contopoulos joined investors to analyze the Fed's decision to keep interest rates steady.
Contopoulos highlighted several factors contributing to the current economic landscape, including the recent bottoming of the Purchasing Managers Index (PMI), record-high stock market performance, significant Bitcoin liquidity, and continued increases in home prices.


Despite the Fed's current position, he suggested that if certain economic data indicate that inflation is accelerating, the agency could change its strategy and consider raising interest rates over the next 12 months.

The debate highlighted the prevailing bullish trend in financial markets, characterized by strong stock market gains and ample liquidity, despite concerns about inflationary pressures. Participants stated that while the FED's official stance has not changed, market dynamics may lead to changes in monetary policy if inflationary pressures intensify.





The conversation also touched on market expectations regarding the Fed's future actions, and participants expressed differing views on the possibility of a rate hike in the coming months. While some have suggested that inflationary trends could prompt a change in the Fed's stance, others have cited the agency's cautious approach and focus on data dependency.

Fox Business Reporter Reveals: "Judge Torres' Favorable Ripple (XRP) Ruling Could Be Reversed, Lawyers Warn" - Bitcoin Sistemi


Fox Business reporter Charles Gasparino reports that securities lawyers are warning Ripple (XRP) holders that Judge Torres' analysis of Ripple could be overturned by federal courts.
The warning follows a ruling by a federal judge against Coinbase, a popular cryptocurrency exchange platform. The judge rejected Coinbase's argument that Torres' Ripple decision supported the dismissal of the lawsuit between it and the SEC. Instead, the judge credited Rakoff's analysis of Terraform, which also rejected Torres' analysis.


Coinbase had a partial gain and a partial loss with the decision made by Judge Katherine Polk Failla in the case filed by the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) against the exchange on Wednesday.

The loss was not unexpected, as even Coinbase's chief legal officer, Paul Grewal, stated that the team was “prepared” for such a decision.





The SEC's legal battle with Coinbase officially began last June, when the securities regulator first filed suit. Gary Gensler's SEC alleges that Coinbase operates as an unregistered exchange, broker and clearing house.
On Wednesday, Judge Katherine Polk Failla largely denied Coinbase's motion for summary judgment, meaning the legal battle between the two will continue.

Short Sellers Bet $11 Billion Against Crypto Stocks Despite Rally | Cryptoglobe


                                
Amidst the dramatic surge in Bitcoin, short sellers are not backing down from their pessimistic bets on cryptocurrency-related stocks, wagering billions in anticipation of a market downturn. According to a Bloomberg report by Carmen Reinicke published on March 26, data from S3 Partners LLC reveals that total short interest in the crypto sector has escalated to nearly $11 billion this year. This surge in short selling is predominantly aimed at MicroStrategy Inc. (NASDAQ: MSTR) and Coinbase Global Inc. (NASDAQ: COIN), which together constitute over 80% of the sector’s total short interest.







Despite facing paper losses nearing $6 billion, owing to Bitcoin’s significant year-to-date increase of over 65%, which in turn boosted related stocks, these traders remain steadfast. Bloomberg cites Ihor Dusaniwsky, managing director of predictive analytics at S3, who explains that these contrarian investors might be seeking a downturn in Bitcoin’s rally or utilizing these short positions as a strategic hedge against actual Bitcoin holdings.



Bloomberg highlights a noticeable trend where short sellers have been intensifying their positions against crypto-linked stocks, particularly MicroStrategy. This focus persists despite the company’s share price climbing, with traders injecting $974 million into bets predicting a decline in the software company’s value. This activity contrasts with some short covering in other crypto-related companies like Coinbase, Marathon Digital Holdings Inc., and Hive Digital Technologies Ltd., as reported by S3.



This increasing skepticism has elevated MicroStrategy’s short interest to over 20% of its total float, positioning it among the most shorted stocks in the U.S. market, alongside industry giants such as Nvidia Corp., Microsoft Corp., and Apple Inc.







However, Bloomberg notes that short sellers might face further challenges. Many stocks in the crypto sector are ripe for short squeezes—situations that compel short sellers to purchase stocks to close their losing bets, inadvertently driving prices up and exacerbating pressures on other traders. S3’s report identifies MicroStrategy, Coinbase, and Cleanspark Inc. as prime candidates for such squeezes, given their significant price rallies and the dwindling number of shares available for shorting. Year-to-date, MicroStrategy’s shares have soared by 148%, while Coinbase and Cleanspark have witnessed increases of approximately 69% and 95%, respectively.



As CryptoGlobe reported on March 29, Kerrisdale Capital Management recently published a report titled “Long Bitcoin / Short MicroStrategy Inc (MSTR): Know When to HODL, Know When to FODL,” proposing a daring approach to investing by recommending buying Bitcoin directly and simultaneously shorting MicroStrategy shares. Known for its bold short-selling strategies, Kerrisdale Capital typically targets overvalued companies or those with dubious operations, backing their bets with comprehensive research. Despite facing criticism for its confrontational style and the inherent conflicts of interest in short selling, Kerrisdale has a notable record in spotting companies’ vulnerabilities.







            
            

            
            

            
            

        

The report critiques MicroStrategy’s inflated stock value, which suggests a Bitcoin worth over $177,000—significantly higher than the actual market price—arguing that such a premium is not sustainable. Kerrisdale forecasts a decline in MicroStrategy’s allure with the emergence of more accessible Bitcoin investment alternatives like ETFs and ETPs.



Challenging MicroStrategy’s claim as a “Bitcoin development company,” Kerrisdale observes that the firm’s valuation heavily relies on its Bitcoin investments, acquired through considerable debt and equity offerings, rather than its primary software analytics business. The firm argues that the strategy of leveraging and diluting shares to acquire Bitcoin does not inherently generate more value for shareholders than directly investing in Bitcoin would.



Kerrisdale also dismisses the rationale behind MicroStrategy’s market premium, including the negligible impact of reinvesting software business cash flows into Bitcoin and the comparison of management fees between MicroStrategy and spot Bitcoin ETFs.



The core of Kerrisdale’s argument is that MicroStrategy’s stock premium over Bitcoin is due for a correction to align more closely with historical averages. With MicroStrategy’s premium rarely surpassing 2.0x and averaging around 1.3x, Kerrisdale anticipates a significant price adjustment for MicroStrategy shares.



The investment strategy Kerrisdale proposes is predicated not on a negative outlook on Bitcoin or MicroStrategy but on an anticipated alignment between the valuation of MicroStrategy’s shares and Bitcoin’s actual market price. Kerrisdale, holding positions both short in MicroStrategy and long in spot Bitcoin ETFs, stands to benefit if their predictive analysis holds true.

SBF gets 25 years in prison, Fidelity eyes ETH staking, and Coinbase’s court loss: Hodler’s Digest, March 24-30 - Cointelegraph Magazine


            
Top Stories This Week



Sam Bankman-Fried sentenced to 25 years in prison



Former FTX CEO Sam “SBF” Bankman-Fried will serve 25 years in prison following a sentencing hearing in federal court. On March 28, Judge Lewis Kaplan of the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York sentenced Bankman-Fried to 240 months and 60 months for his conviction on seven felony charges. Judge Kaplan found that SBF also committed witness tampering based on the events that led him to revoke bail in August 2023 and perjury based on his testimony at trial over FTX user funds. SBF was the first person tied to FTX and Alameda Research to face prison time.



Fidelity files S-1 application with US SEC for spot ETH ETF with staking



Fidelity filed an S-1 application with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) on March 27 to create a spot Ether exchange-traded fund (ETF). As expected from an earlier filing, the ETF will give Fidelity the option to stake part of the ETH it holds. Fidelity Digital Asset Services, which is affiliated with sponsor FD Funds Management, would serve as custodian of the trust’s ETH. The SEC has pushed back the approval deadline for other ETH ETFs to May 23. There are eight applicants for spot ETH EFTs awaiting an SEC decision.



SEC can proceed with Coinbase lawsuit: Court ruling



A United States court has denied Coinbase’s motion to dismiss the SEC’s case against the exchange. The decision, made by U.S. District Judge Katherine Failla, allows the commission to pursue its lawsuit against Coinbase. The SEC sued Coinbase in June 2023, saying the crypto exchange violated federal securities laws by listing 13 tokens it alleged were securities. The firm was seeking an order to drop the case, questioning the SEC’s authority over crypto exchanges.







SEC will ask for $2B in fines and penalties — Ripple chief legal officer



Ripple Labs chief legal officer Stuart Alderoty said the U.S. SEC asked a federal judge for a $2-billion penalty against the blockchain firm. Alderoty said the firm planned to file a response to the SEC request in April but claimed the regulator “trades in statements that are false, mischaracterized and designed to mislead.” Filed by the SEC in December 2020, the lawsuit against Ripple, its CEO Brad Garlinghouse and co-founder Chris Larsen alleged the firm raised $1.3 billion in unregistered securities through sales of XRP tokens.



Canadian authorities move to seize assets tied to QuadrigaCX CEO



The director of civil forfeiture in the Canadian province of British Columbia has made an unexplained wealth order to confiscate cash, 45 gold bars and luxury items found in a safe deposit box linked to a co-founder of the QuadrigaCX cryptocurrency exchange. An unexplained wealth order is a type of court order that compels a person to explain how they acquired their assets. According to documents submitted to the British Columbia Supreme Court, the assets are allegedly the proceeds of criminal activities. QuadrigaCX became insolvent in February 2019, shortly after its co-founder, Gerald Cotten, died in India, taking the private keys to QuadrigaCX’s offline storage systems to the grave.







Winners and Losers







At the end of the week, Bitcoin (BTC) is at $69,437, Ether (ETH) at $3,482 and XRP at $0.62. The total market cap is at $2.62 trillion, according to CoinMarketCap.



Among the biggest 100 cryptocurrencies, the top three altcoin gainers of the week are Core (CORE) at 105.58%, Dogwifhat (WIF) at 80.50% and Bitcoin Cash (BCH) at 48.69%.

Prediction of the week



Bitcoin gears up for a ‘massive’ short squeeze, price could go ‘vertical’



As Bitcoin toes around the $70,000 price mark, there’s speculation that short-sellers are feeling the pressure due to diminishing downtrends and quicker-moving uptrends, potentially driving Bitcoin’s price to $80,000, according to an analyst.



“This is a textbook sign that shorts are being squeezed as we hit fresh all-time high territory,” trading resource The Kobeissi Letter stated in a March 26 X post.



The Kobeissi Letter explained the main factor for the BTC short squeeze is the margin between institutional long positions and hedge fund short positions is “at a record high.”



If Bitcoin price reaches $71,000, $156.18 million in short positions will be liquidated, per CoinGlass data. A climb to $75,000 will liquidate $3.85 billion in short positions.







FUD of the Week



US Justice Department charges KuCoin and two founders with violating AML laws



U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) officials unsealed an indictment against crypto exchange KuCoin and two of its founders for “conspiring to operate an unlicensed money transmitting business” and violations of the Bank Secrecy Act. The DOJ criminal charges were announced in parallel to a civil enforcement case from the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC), which charged KuCoin “with multiple violations of the Commodity Exchange Act (CEA) and CFTC regulations” on March 26. According to the DOJ, KuCoin received more than $5 billion and sent more than $4 billion of “suspicious and criminal funds.”



Munchables hacker returns $62.8M Ether without ransom

US lawmakers demand SEC clarify position on Prometheum’s plans for Ether



U.S. lawmakers, including House Financial Services Committee Chair Patrick McHenry and Vice Chair French Hill, are urging SEC Chair Gary Gensler to address crypto firm Prometheum’s intention to offer institutional custody services for Ether. According to lawmakers, the announcement is at odds with the Commodity Futures Trading Commission’s (CFTC) stance on recognizing ETH as a “non-security digital asset” under its purview.

China's Yuan Emerges as Russia's Lifeline for Reserves | Cryptoglobe


                                
In a revealing update from Russia’s central bank, it’s become clear that amidst ongoing international tensions, the Chinese yuan is emerging as a crucial asset for Russia’s reserve holdings. According to a Bloomberg News article published on March 29, the Russian financial authority has expressed a lack of viable alternatives to the yuan following the economic repercussions of the Kremlin’s actions in Ukraine and subsequent international sanctions.



Bloomberg highlights that, per the central bank’s annual report, options for reserve currencies are notably thin on the ground for Russia, given the precarious nature of financial instruments from nations maintaining a friendly stance towards it. Issues cited include the high volatility of these alternative currencies, their markets’ low liquidity, and capital movement restrictions within these countries, all contributing to the yuan’s prominence in Russia’s reserve strategy.



This development underscores the shifting dynamics in Russia’s economic relations, as noted by Bloomberg. With the West turning its back through sanctions in response to the Ukraine conflict, Russia has increasingly leaned towards Asia—most notably China—to sustain its economy. The burgeoning trade relationship with China has played a pivotal role in enabling Russia to navigate the economic challenges posed by Western sanctions, alongside bolstered government expenditure.







            
            

            
            

            
            

        

An interesting tidbit from Bloomberg’s coverage reveals the yuan’s ascension in Russia’s financial ecosystem; it has overtaken the US dollar as the most frequently traded currency. This marks a significant shift from the period prior to the start of the Russia-Ukraine conflict when the yuan’s presence in Russian markets was virtually unnoticed.



Furthermore, Bloomberg reports that as of March 22, Russia’s international reserves were valued at $590.1 billion, reflecting a $40 billion decrease over two years of conflict. This figure includes $300 billion in assets frozen by Western nations—a situation the Russian central bank is actively seeking to navigate, asserting ownership rights over these blocked reserves.



Despite the sanctions and asset freezes, Russia’s reserve values experienced a marginal increase in 2023, primarily attributed to the rising price of gold, as detailed by Bloomberg. In a move towards opacity, the Russian central bank has ceased disclosing the specific makeup of its international reserves since the war began, opting instead to report only on the proportions of gold and foreign currency held.

Anthropic Shuns Saudi Investments Amid FTX Bankruptcy Sale, Citing National Security Concerns



                    
AI startup Anthropic has decided not to accept investments from Saudi Arabia for the sale of an 8% stake in the company, originally purchased by Sam Bankman-Fried three years ago for $500 million. 



This decision is made amidst the bankruptcy proceedings of FTX, and the stake, spurred by the booming interest in AI technologies, is now valued at over $1 billion. 




The rejection of Saudi investments is attributed to national security concerns, particularly regarding the potential dual-use of technology for civilian and military applications, which could complicate matters with regulatory bodies like the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS).



The sale, expected to finalize in the coming weeks, aims to use the proceeds to repay FTX customers. 



The shares, classified as class B and lacking voting rights, are valued based on Anthropic’s latest $18.4 billion valuation. 




Despite the company’s significant funding rounds totaling about $7 billion from tech behemoths such as Amazon, Alphabet, and Salesforce, the current transaction excludes these entities from the pool of potential buyers. 



Instead, the sale is targeted towards a new investor syndicate through special purpose vehicles (SPVs), with venture firms being approached to participate.



Anthropic, known for its advanced language model competing with OpenAI’s ChatGPT, is led by founders Dario and Daniela Amodei.

Although they have the right to vet investors, they are not directly involved in the ongoing sale discussions. 



Their acquaintance with Bankman-Fried was facilitated by a mutual interest in “effective altruism,” aimed at leveraging wealth for charitable causes.



While rejecting Saudi Arabian funds, Anthropic is open to investments from other sovereign wealth entities, including the UAE’s Mubadala, which is reportedly considering an investment. 



The marketing of FTX’s stake is managed by Perella Weinberg.



Saudi Arabia’s sovereign wealth fund, the PIF, with assets over $900 billion, continues its aggressive technology sector investments, including talks with Andreessen Horowitz for creating a $40 billion AI-focused fund. 



These moves align with Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman’s “Vision 2030 Initiative” to diversify the nation’s economy beyond oil, including investments in global tech companies, sports leagues, and enhancing international financial relationships. 



This backdrop adds complexity to Anthropic’s decision, especially as Saudi Arabia seeks to strengthen its tech capabilities amid growing ties with China.

TRON Dominates Nearly 50% of Illicit Crypto Activity: TRM Labs Report


																The TRON network accounted for 45% of all illicit volume in 2023, according to data released by analysts at blockchain forensics firm TRM Labs.
TRM Labs released a report titled “The Illicit Crypto Economy” on Wednesday shedding light on the key trends in 2023 related to illicit activities and funds in the crypto space.
TRON Blockchain Dominates Illicit Activity
TRON blockchain network, founded by Chinese entrepreneur Justin Sun, accounted for the highest illicit activity last year, 45%, a surge from 41% in 2022. Ethereum and Bitcoin networks followed at 24% and 18%, respectively.
TRON also emerged as a favored network for hackers associated with North Korea, who frequently exchange stolen funds, predominantly for USDT, on its network. Subsequently, these laundered crypto funds are converted to fiat currency through high-volume over-the-counter (OTC) brokers.
According to TRM Labs, USDT stablecoin issued by Tether Inc. has become the preferred currency for terrorist financing entities, accounting for over $19 billion worth of illicit funds. In contrast, another stablecoin, USD Coin (USDC), recorded only $428.9 million in illicit volume.




Meanwhile, while other categories of illicit financing in crypto decreased, drug sales on darknet marketplaces saw an increase, reaching $1.6 billion in 2023, up from $1.3 billion in 2022. TRM Labs reported that the volume of drug sales using TRON more than quadrupled during this period.
Cybercriminals appear to prefer the TRON blockchain due to its relatively low gas fees, minimal price fluctuations, and a perception, although outdated, that it is more challenging to trace transactions conducted on this network.
Crypto Illicit Activity Decreased by 9%
The crypto space saw a decrease in illicit activity, with total illicit funds shrinking by 9% in 2023 compared to the previous year, according to TRM Labs. Despite this reduction, criminals still managed nearly $35 billion worth of cryptocurrencies.
Scams and frauds accounted for nearly a third of all crypto crimes in 2023. However, the share of illicit funds in the crypto space decreased over the year, though it still remains significantly higher than existing industry estimates.
TRM Labs observed declining volumes of hacked and sanctions-exposed funds, attributed to increased pressure from governments and law enforcement agencies globally. The report highlighted that the U.S. alone tripled the number of crypto crime-linked entities and individuals subject to sanctions.
Notably, hackers associated with North Korea obtained 30% less than in 2022, while hack proceeds decreased by over 50% to $1.8 billion from $3.7 billion in the previous year. This decline shows the impact of heightened enforcement efforts on illicit activities within the crypto space.

Worldcoin Earns Approval From Ethereum Founder For Privacy Initiatives


								A battle between technological advancement and data privacy is brewing around Worldcoin, a project offering digital identity and cryptocurrency in exchange for iris scans.
While Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin applauds Worldcoin’s efforts to strengthen privacy measures, Portugal’s data regulator has thrown a wrench into the program by halting biometric data collection for 90 days.

Worldcoin’s system hinges on a unique approach. Instead of traditional signup methods like name and address, users submit iris scans to create a digital ID.
This anonymity is incentivized by offering free WLD cryptocurrency tokens. The program has garnered over 4.6 million users globally, but concerns about data privacy have dogged it from the start.
Buterin Praises Worldcoin In Addressing Privacy Issues
Buterin, a crypto heavyweight, seems to stand by Worldcoin. He recently commended the team’s “data-minimal” approach and their commitment to addressing privacy critiques. He believes they outperform traditional, centralized authentication solutions in terms of privacy protection.


However, regulators aren’t convinced. Portugal joins Kenya in raising red flags. The Portuguese National Commission for Data Protection (CNPD) expressed fear of “serious harm” to citizens’ data rights.
This move comes after over 300,000 Portuguese individuals entrusted their iris data to Worldcoin. The CNPD cited the high risk associated with storing biometric information as justification for the suspension.

The situation raises several questions. Firstly, how secure is iris scan data in the long run? Breaches of such sensitive information could have severe consequences.
Secondly, are Worldcoin’s anonymization techniques robust enough? Even anonymized data can potentially be linked back to individuals, especially with advancements in facial recognition technology.
Finally, could alternative verification methods achieve similar goals without compromising user privacy?
Worldcoin: The Road Ahead

Worldcoin’s approach presents undeniable benefits. By eliminating traditional identification methods, they potentially create a more inclusive financial system, particularly for the unbanked population.
But these benefits come at a cost. The program hinges on trust, and the onus lies on Worldcoin to demonstrate their commitment to user privacy.
Moving forward, Worldcoin must navigate a tightrope. They need to convince regulators and users that their data is safe and anonymization techniques are foolproof.
Transparency about data storage practices and potential risks is crucial. Additionally, exploring alternative verification methods that minimize privacy risks could be a strategic move.

Goldman Sachs Sees Surge in Crypto Interest Following Spot Bitcoin ETF Approvals



                    
Goldman Sachs has seen a significant resurgence in client interest in cryptocurrencies this year, largely fueled by the U.S. approval of spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs). 



According to Max Minton, the head of digital assets for Goldman Asia Pacific, a notable shift has occurred among the firm’s clientele, ranging from renewed activity to explorations into the crypto space. 




This shift was detailed in a Bloomberg report dated March 24, highlighting the influence of the recent approval of ten Bitcoin ETFs in January on the traditional market’s embrace of cryptocurrencies.



Minton attributes this revived enthusiasm directly to the ETF approvals, stating, “The recent ETF approval has triggered a resurgence of interest and activities from our clients.” 



He observed that the primary interest comes from existing Goldman clients, particularly through options and futures in the crypto domain, with hedge funds being the most engaged segment.

Despite not offering spot crypto products and focusing on crypto derivatives like Bitcoin and Ether options and futures since launching its first crypto trading desk in 2021, Goldman Sachs reported a record $2.8 trillion in assets under management by the end of 2023. 



Minton noted a quiet previous year but mentioned an uptick in client interest and activities, including onboarding and transactions, from the beginning of the year.



Clients of Goldman Sachs are leveraging derivatives to tap into the volatility of the cryptocurrency market and to speculate on future price movements. 



Bitcoin-related derivatives have emerged as particularly popular among the firm’s active investors. 



Furthermore, Minton speculated on the potential impact that the approval of a spot Ether ETF in the U.S. could have, potentially drawing institutional clients towards Ether, although Bloomberg ETF analysts currently estimate only a 35% chance of such an approval by May.



Despite regulatory challenges, Minton emphasized Goldman’s intention to broaden its client base to include asset management funds, banks, and specialized crypto asset firms, signaling a strategic expansion into the crypto market irrespective of immediate ETF developments.

New Developments in the Terra-SEC Case: Shocking Details of LUNA Collapse Revealed - Here's What Happened Behind the Scenes - Bitcoin Sistemi

James Hunsaker, a former employee of Jump Trading, made a shocking statement in the Terraform Labs case today. Hunsaker revealed that he had filed a notice against Jump Trading with the SEC, alleging Do Kwon's role in backing the UST algorithmic stablecoin before its $40 billion collapse in 2022.
Jump Trading Spent Hundreds of Millions of Dollars to Save LUNA 1 Year Before the Real Collapse
According to the statement, Jump Trading, a mysterious frequent trading firm that also owns cryptocurrency, had entered into a “significant agreement” with Terraform Labs (TFL) to increase adoption of UST.


Hunsaker, who worked at Jump Crypto before founding the blockchain startup Monad Labs, stated that when UST left the $1 peg in May 2021, Jump Crypto president Kanav Kariya said, “I talked to Do, he will give us tokens to be unlocked later.” .
Following this, Jump Trading co-founder Bill DiSomma directed investors to take “aggressive trades” and accumulate UST. Hunsaker described DiSomma as the real boss of Jump Crypto, rather than Kariya. “Since Terra was a large and important project for Jump, he was willing to risk several hundred million dollars to do it,” Hunsaker testified.





Both Kariya and DiSomma exercised their right of non-response in their statements to the SEC for the Terraform Labs case. The SEC stated that Jump made approximately $1 billion in profits through its deals with Terraform Labs.

A key part of the SEC's fraud case against TFL and Do Kwon was their claim that they concealed Jump's role in saving UST during the May 2021 depeg before the actual 2022 collapse. Kwon claimed that UST was “automatically self-healing,” and investors believed it.


Hunsaker left Jump in February 2022. After the debacle in May, she attempted to share her experiences on Reddit and anonymously. In August 2022, he filed a whistleblower complaint with the SEC. “When I saw the impact of May 2022 on all of its victims, I sought to ensure that some form of justice and compensation was provided,” Hunsaker told the court.
Interestingly, Hunsaker had invested $200,000 of his own money into UST to get a ~20% return on Anchor Protocol. Despite his doubts about the stability of the UST, he believed that he could exit quickly if necessary. He sold his UST on May 7 or 8, 2022, when the depeg started.

These Are the Conditions Outlined by Prisma Finance's Hacker


The hacker behind the $11.6 million breach on Prisma Finance has outlined conditions for returning the stolen funds.
In an on-chain message, the self-proclaimed white hat hacker lamented the team’s slow response.
Hacker Details Conditions to Return Prisma Finance Funds
On March 28, DeFi protocol Prisma Finance reported a security breach that led to the loss of 3,257.57 wstETH, worth $11.6 million. Since then, the project has urged its users to revoke delegate approvals and released a comprehensive post-mortem audit about the incident. 
According to Prisma Finance, the hacker exploited a vulnerability in both versions of the project’s MigrateTroveZap (mkUSD and ULTRA) contracts, and around 20 addresses remain affected.
The Prisma Finance hacker now demands that the project conduct an online press conference where all team members would reveal their identities. He also wants the team to address past mistakes, disclose the smart contract’s auditor, and present plans for enhancing security measures. 
Besides that, Prisma Finance must also inform the community about contract deployment strategies and emergency response protocols.

The hacker also expressed dissatisfaction with terms like “exploit” and “attack” in the post-mortem audit. He emphasized that the illicit transactions were in line with smart contract terms agreed upon by all parties. 

“You cannot agree something with others, and then judge it is wrong or it is true. No human rights. You should have been more careful before deploying your contract. I hope this would help people be more careful participating in defi, the teams would be more responsible, and everyone would change their minds about things like this,” the hacker wrote.

Consequently, the hacker refuted claims of malicious intent. He further urged Prisma Finance to retract the accusatory language within 12 hours.

Despite these demands to return the stolen funds, the crypto community questions the attacker’s status as a white hat hacker. 

He has utilized the OFAC-sanctioned crypto mixing tool Tornado Cash to obfuscate his transactions. Blockchain security firm Peckshield reported that addresses belonging to the hacker moved more than 1,000 ETH through the mixer. Regardless, the hacker continues to ensure that stolen funds will be returned.

“After [the online conference] happens, the amount I would keep, and the amount that I can send to you would be discussed (stay assured, most of it would be returned) and the notes would be sent to your email,” the hacker added.

Bitcoin Braces for Supply Crunch as Demand Skyrockets, Warns CryptoQuant



                    
Bitcoin is on the verge of a supply crunch, according to recent insights from CryptoQuant’s “Weekly Crypto Report” dated March 26. 



The analysis highlights a looming “sell-side liquidity crisis” as demand for Bitcoin surges, particularly influenced by the introduction of spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) in the United States. 




This increased demand, coupled with a dwindling supply, signals a pivotal shift in Bitcoin’s market dynamics, potentially altering its supply landscape irreversibly by the early months of 2025.



CryptoQuant’s report illuminates the stark reality of Bitcoin’s dwindling sell-side liquidity. 



“Record Bitcoin demand paired with declining sell-side liquidity has resulted in the liquid inventory of Bitcoin plunging to the lowest ever in terms of months of demand,” the platform notes, estimating the current sell-side liquidity inventory can only satisfy the burgeoning demand for about twelve months. 




The analysis focuses solely on “accumulating addresses,” which are wallets that have not made any outbound transactions, suggesting the actual demand could be even greater. 



“This is only considering demand from accumulating addresses, which may be considered as the lower-end of Bitcoin demand,” CryptoQuant elaborates.



When examining Bitcoin’s availability strictly on United States exchanges, the timeframe during which supply can meet demand halves.

“The Bitcoin liquid inventory drops to six months of demand if we exclude the Bitcoin on exchanges outside the US. 



“We exclude these exchanges considering that US spot Bitcoin ETFs will only source Bitcoin from US entities,” the report details.



Ki Young Ju, CEO of CryptoQuant, took to X (formerly Twitter) to discuss the emerging sell-side liquidity crisis. 



He commented on the surprising activity of Bitcoins mined in 2010 and dormant since then, now moving to new wallet addresses. 



Ju has been a vocal proponent of the ETF supply squeeze theory, previously forecasting a six-month window in mid-March as ETF inflows surged to record highs.



Although there was a brief period of net outflows from these products, recent trends suggest a reversal, with the latest figures from Farside, a UK investment firm, indicating significant net inflows of $400 million on March 25—the largest in two weeks. 



This data underscores the growing investor interest in Bitcoin, even as the supply tightens, heralding a potentially transformative period for its market dynamics.

Grayscale Launches New Institutional Crypto Fund With Staking Rewards


																On March 29, the firm announced its Grayscale Dynamic Income Fund (GDIF) stating that it is its first actively managed investment product.
Grayscale added that the new fund aims to optimize income in the form of staking rewards associated with proof-of-stake crypto assets.
It is the latest effort from the world’s largest crypto asset manager to retain clients and capital following a huge exodus from its flagship product (GBTC) and its conversion to a spot Bitcoin ETF.


Grayscale Goes Into Staking
“Using qualitative and quantitative factors, we invest capital across a portfolio of proof-of-stake tokens,” it stated.
The fund will monetize token rewards into cash on a weekly basis, distribute the earnings to investors quarterly, and rebalance tokens to optimize income.




The disclosed holdings of the fund were very vague. It will be comprised of 24% of the decentralized Cosmos exchange Osmosis token, OSMO. An additional 20% will be held in Solana (SOL), and 14% will be in Polkadot (DOT).
The remaining 43% was mysteriously labeled as “other,” and there was no mention of the world’s largest proof-of-stake token, Ethereum. The Portfolio Manager for GDIF is Matt Maximo, who has been with Grayscale Investments since 2021.
Additionally, the new fund is only available to high-net-worth individuals with assets under management of more than $1.1 million or a net worth of more than $2.2 million, and it has a 10% performance fee.
Grayscale’s industry-leading Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) has been hemorrhaging capital since it converted to a spot ETF in January. The fund, which once held a whopping 620,000 BTC, has shrunk by 46%, having lost 284,846 BTC worth $20 billion over the past eleven weeks.
This week alone, GBTC has shed $967 million worth of BTC. However, competing products from BlackRock and Fidelity have scooped up more, reversing a trend of outflows for Bitcoin ETFs.


Staking Outlook
The global staking market capitalization is around $355 billion, according to Staking Rewards.
It lists ETH as the leading staking asset, with $110 billion worth staked. Solana is the second-largest with $72 billion staked, followed by SUI, Aptos, and Cardano, which have around $15 billion worth staked each.
The average reward rate is 6%, it reported, though many of the higher-cap coins, such as ETH, SUI, ADA, and BNB, are lower than that.

Solana's 2-year high: How WIF, PEPE and BOME played a part - AMBCrypto



Demand for Solana has risen to its highest level since 2022.
Its DeFi and NFT have witnessed growth since the beginning of March.

User activity on Layer 1 (L1) blockchain network Solana [SOL] has climbed to a two-year high in March, according to The Block data dashboard. 
The surge in Solana’s network activity since the beginning of March is attributable to the uptick in memecoin trading activity on the network. 
In the last month, the values of Solana-based meme coins such as Book of Meme [BOME], dogwifhat [WIF], and Pepe [PEPE] have risen by 1561%, 464%, and 157%, respectively.
Solana reaches new milestone
AMBCrypto found that in the past 29 days, the number of unique addresses that have signed transactions across the Solana network has totaled 34.21 million. 
This marks a 70% spike from the 20 million active user count recorded in February and the network’s highest monthly count since May 2022.
Source: The Block
As the memecoin hype intensified, Solana onboarded a significant number of new users who desired to profit from the meme market rally. 
Data from The Block showed that since the beginning of March, the number of unique first signers to transact on the Solana Network has totaled 25.43 million. This represents a 108% growth in new demand for the L1 within a 30-day period. 
According to the on-chain data provider, March’s figure marks an all-time high in the monthly count of new users.
Source: The Block
Due to the high user activity on the network, Solana’s transaction volume so far this month is above $143 trillion, up from $104 trillion in February. 
Solana’s DeFi and NFT verticals
According to DefiLlama’s data, out of the top five networks ranked by DeFi TVL, the network has recorded the most growth in the last 30 days. 
At $4.8 billion as of this writing, its TVL has spiked by 91% in the last month. Solana’s TVL sits at its highest level since February 2022.
Regarding the network’s NFT ecosystem, it has seen a month-over-month growth in sales volume, data from CryptoSlam showed. 

Read Solana’s [SOL] Price Prediction 2024-2025

In the past 29 days, Solana’s NFT sales volume has amounted to $234 million, marking an 8% increase from February’s $216 million.
This has occurred despite more NFT transactions being executed in February. According to CryptoSlam, 4 million NFT transactions were completed in February, but only 2 million transactions have been completed so far this month.
