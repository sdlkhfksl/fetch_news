Did Regulations Push LocalMonero Out? Privacy Coin Platform Bites The Dust


								The winds of regulatory change are howling through the cryptocurrency space, and a prominent victim has emerged. LocalMonero, a veteran P2P (peer-to-peer) trading platform for the privacy-focused Monero (XMR) coin, announced its closure on May 7th, citing a combination of “internal and external factors.” This move has sent shockwaves through the Monero community and reignited the debate between financial privacy and regulatory oversight.

LocalMonero: P2P Platforms In The Crosshairs
LocalMonero’s demise comes amidst a period of heightened scrutiny by US authorities towards the crypto industry. From the arrest of the developers behind the privacy-focused Samourai Wallet to the SEC’s crackdown on centralized exchanges like Robinhood, regulators are wielding a heavy hand in an effort to enforce anti-money laundering (AML) and securities laws. P2P platforms, with their decentralized nature and potential for anonymous transactions, have become a particular point of concern.


While the exact reasons behind LocalMonero’s closure remain shrouded in some mystery, the timing paints a bleak picture. The platform’s decision to shut down follows a warning from the Financial Action Task Force (FATF), an intergovernmental watchdog, highlighting the potential misuse of P2P platforms for illicit financing. This, coupled with the ongoing delisting of privacy coins by major centralized exchanges, creates a chilling effect on the entire privacy-focused crypto ecosystem.

Privacy Vs. Regulation: A Collision Course
The closure of LocalMonero has sparked outrage and fear within the Monero community. Many see it as a blatant attack on their right to financial privacy. Freedom advocates have labeled the current regulatory landscape a “war on crypto,” urging users to band together and learn about digital privacy tools. They also compare the government’s approach to “terrorism,” arguing that it stifles innovation and creates an atmosphere of fear.

However, the concerns of regulators shouldn’t be entirely dismissed. Privacy coins, with their ability to obfuscate transaction details, can indeed be attractive for those seeking to launder money or finance illegal activities. Striking a balance between user privacy and effective AML/KYC (Know Your Customer) regulations is a complex challenge.
The Future of Privacy-Focused Crypto
The future of privacy-focused crypto projects like Monero hangs in the balance. While LocalMonero remains optimistic, pointing to upcoming developments within the Monero ecosystem like Haveno DEX and Full Chain Member Proofs (FCMP), the regulatory pressure is undeniable.

Airbnb Shares Slide Over 6% on Weaker-Than-Expected Q2 Outlook - Tokenist


					
Neither the author, Tim Fries, nor this website, The Tokenist, provide financial advice. Please consult our website policy prior to making financial decisions.



Airbnb Inc. (NASDAQ: ABNB) shares tumbled more than 6% on Wednesday after the vacation rental company issued a weaker-than-expected outlook for the current quarter.



The stock had gained about 9.34% over the past 12 months. For the quarter ending March 2024, Airbnb had reported an EPS of $0.41, beating expectations by approximately 75%.



Airbnb Stock Price Update



Airbnb shares fell over 6% since the market opened at the time of writing, trading at $147. The stock finds a zone of support between $141 and $148 from the 200-day moving average and price action dating back to September last year.



However, failure to hold above this support zone opens the door for Airbnb’s stock price to potentially decline to lower support around $126.





Why Airbnb Stock Dipped Today



Airbnb reported first-quarter revenue of $2.14 billion, up 18% year-over-year, and adjusted earnings per share of $0.41, beating analyst estimates of $2.06 billion in revenue and $0.24 EPS. Despite the strong results, Airbnb’s second-quarter revenue forecast of $2.68-$2.74 billion, representing 8-10% growth, had its midpoint below the $2.74 billion Wall Street consensus, disappointing investors.



The company cited headwinds to second-quarter results from the timing of Easter, an extra leap-year day in the first quarter, and foreign exchange fluctuations. Jefferies maintained a Hold rating and $150 price target on Airbnb stock, stating that the results failed to ease growing fears of slowing growth. Morgan Stanley kept an Underweight rating and $120 target as room night growth continues to underwhelm.



Bank of America acknowledged Airbnb’s strong first-quarter performance but noted that the company’s outlook reflects slowing travel growth. As a result, BofA cut its price target on Airbnb stock to $160 from $168.

Ripple and XRPL Labs Join Digital Asset Recovery Protocol DeRec Alliance | Coinspeaker



The DeRec Alliance now has Ripple and XRPL Labs as founding members, as they develop a protocol for easy asset recovery.

Ripple and XRP Labs are now members of the Decentralized Recovery (DeRec) Alliance, an association formed to create an open-source and industry-standard methodology to simplify digital asset recovery. Along with Hedera blockchain network developer Swirld Labs, and the Algorand Foundation, Ripple and XRPL Labs are the founding members of the DeRec Alliance.
DeRec Alliance Simplifies for Crypto Asset Recovery
An official press release notes that today’s Web3 applications require a “highly sophisticated user” that understands and can handle the task of securing sensitive information, including digital assets, keys, accounts, and passwords. With decentralized recovery, self-custody, cold storage, and other forms of account recovery are unnecessary.




The Alliance was founded by Dr. Leemon Baird, also the co-founder of Hedera. Baird stated:
“The DeRec Alliance is a group of individuals and organizations committed to making the process of securing and recovering digital assets, accounts, passwords, and other secrets as simple as existing Web2 experiences. We encourage every blockchain and every industry to work together to create the standards and the open source code needed to bring safety to the promise of Web3, without the complexity.”
Members of the DeRec Alliance also include The Hashgraph Association, Casper Association, Acoer, and Constellation Network. Others are The HBAR Foundation, Revive Labs, The Building Blocks, Blade Labs, and BankSocial. All Alliance members are tasked with providing input and feedback on policies that will help create an interoperable recovery standard. The plan is to ease the recovery and adoption of crypto and other assets.
According to Markus Infanger, Senior Vice President of RippleX, the developer and community platform created by Ripple, The DeRec Alliance solves one of the biggest problems facing crypto adoption. Infanger said by developing clear standards for key recovery, the Alliance gives users more control and boosts their confidence. XRPL Labs founder and CEO Wietse Wind echoed Infanger’s sentiments, adding that user-friendly solutions for key recovery are essential to mass retail adoption.
The DeRec Alliance features a Technical Oversight Committee (TOC) with two-year seats filled by founding members. The TOC’s function is to offer input on the Alliance’s governance structure and core policies.
DeRec Protocol Shares Secrets among “Helpers”
The Alliance’s method is the Decentralized Recovery (DeRec) open-source protocol that takes a secret-sharing approach to recovery data management. The protocol helps a user share secrets among a list of helpers (businesses or friends)that can help the user recover their secret whenever necessary. Each helper’s share does not indicate any information about the original secret, which can only be properly compiled by the original user. Also, the user can reconstruct their original secret even if only half the helpers reveal their shares. This works even if the user has lost their primary two-factor recovery device, such as their phone.
To maintain availability, the DeRec protocol periodically uses regular confirmations to ensure that helpers still hold their shares of the secret. In addition, the protocol initiates automatic re-sharing whenever the secret changes, or a helper leaves or joins. Throughout the process, the user never has to reveal any helper’s identity or the number of helpers they have. In the same way, helpers also do not have information about other helpers.

Binance Rejects Secret Crypto Settlement as Nigerian Authorities Detain Compliance Chief



                    

Recent revelations have surfaced regarding the interactions between Nigerian officials and Binance representatives, implicating that Nigerian authorities attempted to pressure Binance into an undisclosed settlement paid in cryptocurrency. 



These events reportedly transpired during meetings early in 2024.




Binance’s CEO, Richard Teng, has spoken out about the situation, specifically addressing the ongoing detention of Tigran Gambaryan, a former agent of the United States Internal Revenue Service and the current head of Binance’s financial crime compliance team. Gambaryan was detained in Nigeria while on a business trip. 



According to Teng, this incident marks a concerning precedent as it reflects the potential risks global companies may face when operating internationally.



Teng’s statement condemned the Nigerian government’s approach, claiming it set a “dangerous new precedent for all companies worldwide” following the detainment of Gambaryan and another employee. 




He narrated how Binance made efforts to engage positively with Nigerian officials, participating in regulatory discussions and collaborating with law enforcement to address any concerns transparently.



The matter escalated after Binance was invited to a public investigative hearing by the chairman of the House of Representatives Committee on Financial Crimes (HCFC). 



Despite being prepared to address any allegations in a public forum, Teng noted that the details of the accusations were not provided to them, leading to their request to respond in writing, a proposal still pending response from the committee.



Amidst these discussions, Binance personnel were approached by unidentified individuals offering to settle the allegations secretly using cryptocurrency, demanding a substantial payment within 48 hours.

Teng disclosed that their local legal counsel was presented with these terms by an agent of the HCFC, emphasizing the secretive and urgent nature of the deal. Binance declined the offer and continued to seek a diplomatic resolution to the matter.



Following the refusal, further meetings were arranged involving representatives from various Nigerian governmental bodies, including the National Security Adviser’s office and the Central Bank of Nigeria, among others. 



Despite the complexity of the situation, Teng stated that Gambaryan and Nadeem Anjarwalla, head of Binance Africa, were assured of their safety for these meetings.



However, the situation worsened when Nigerian officials detained Gambaryan and Anjarwalla, confiscated their passports and phones, and demanded that Binance comply with specific requests, including delisting the Nigerian naira from their platform. 



In response to the escalating demands and the continued detention of its employees, Binance has temporarily shut down certain services in Nigeria, hoping to secure their release and resolve the situation amicably.

Robinhood (HOOD) Wells Notice Shouldn’t Deter Eventual SEC Approval of an Ether (ETH) Spot ETF: JPMorgan

The popular trading platform received the notice – a preliminary warning from the regulator about potential enforcement action – on May 4, the company said in a filing on Monday. The notice should be viewed as a “continued attempt by the SEC to reinforce its position that all crypto tokens outside bitcoin and ether should be classified as securities,” analysts led by Nikolaos Panigirtzoglou wrote.

Binance banned Tron Foundation for market manipulation, report


A report from the Wall Street Journal has alleged that on multiple occasions, Binance ignored its own internal investigations about market manipulation in favor of preserving relationships with important clients. 
In one case in 2023, a trading firm called DWF Labs, led by Russian Andrei Grachev, was making over $4 billion in trades on Binance per month. DWF allegedly offered a service to clients where it would create “artificial volume” and drive up the price of tokens. 
One example described in the report is about Yield Guild Games, a token that DWF invested in. Grachev tweeted about it, DWF sold a huge number of tokens, and very shortly afterwards, the price of the token collapsed. 

Following some of these events, the internal surveillance team at Binance recommended removing DWF and included wash trades it identified as part of this analysis.
However, a second internal Binance team investigated the surveillance team, allegedly determining that the wash trades conducted by the firm, which advertised its ability to create “artificial volume,” may have been accidental, after which Binance chose not to offload DWF Labs.
The report claims that two traders accounted for two-thirds of all Binance volume in 2023, which may have motivated the reticence.
This internal surveillance team also raised concerns about Binance’s own internal accounts trading cryptocurrencies on Binance, an allegation which was echoed in the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) complaint that Binance recently settled.

Following the surveillance team’s report about DWF, the Wall Street Journal noted that the head of the team was fired, several other investigators were ‘laid-off’ as a ‘cost-saving measure’, and others resigned. 
Tron and Justin Sun
Grachev previously worked for Huobi, now HTX, leading it’s Russian arm. HTX is advised by Justin Sun, who also leads the Tron Foundation, which also ran afoul of Binance’s internal investigators.
In the months following Sun and the Tron Foundation being charged by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) with market manipulation and wash trading last year, Binance decided to off-board the Tron Foundation. 
However, despite the alleged market manipulation of the Tron Foundation, Binance did still decide to make TrueUSD a ‘zero-fee’ base asset for a variety of trading pairs around the same time they were offboarding Tron Foundation. Sun has been accused of owning TrueUSD but denies the accusations. Sun has admitted he is a ‘partner market maker’ for this asset, and the previous issues with Sun projects manipulating markets did not prevent Binance from embracing this project. 

More recently, the market cap of TrueUSD has collapsed as Binance has moved to other stablecoins like First Digital USD.
The Wall Street Journal report alleges a culture of allowing illicit activity to continue as long as it benefits Binance.

Cardano (ADA), the 10th-largest cryptocurrency by market cap, has recently experienced a remarkable surge in trading volume, coinciding with a surprising reversal in its price trajectory. This sudden uptick in activity has caught the attention of traders and investors, sparking speculation. According to CoinMarketCap data, Cardano's (ADA) trading volume has risen over 90% in the last 24 hours, with nearly half a billion dollars ($500 million) exchanged. This surge in volume suggests a significant influx of buying and selling activity, indicative of higher market activity and increased liquidity for the cryptocurrency.With the spike in trading volume, ADA's price has unexpectedly reversed. After three consecutive days of declines, ADA's price rebounded to reach highs of $0.469 on May 8. ADA was still sustaining its prior day gains at the time of writing, unlike the majority in the top 10, including Bitcoin and Ethereum, which traded in the red.ADA/USD Daily Chart, Courtesy: TradingViewADA was up 1.56% in the last 24 hours at the time of writing to $0.452, having erased some of its gains. This seeming reversal has sparked renewed enthusiasm among the Cardano community and potential investors, who are now keenly observing ADA price performance.Also, several cryptocurrencies are seeing a decline in trading volume, indicating that traders have been indecisive. This context makes Cardano's volume increase all the more significant, as it bucks the general market trend.Given the recent increase in both volume and price for ADA, the crypto community is keeping a careful eye on whether this trend will continue. On the upside, ADA meets its next resistance level at $0.476; if prices fall, support will be seen near the $0.418 level.

Donald Trump Says 'You Better Vote' For Him If You're Pro-Crypto: But Has He Always Been 'Fine With It'? - Benzinga

Former U.S. President Donald Trump on Wednesday publicly endorsed cryptocurrency, declaring it a significant election issue—a move that contrasts with President Joe Biden‘s perceived unfamiliarity with the crypto world.What Happened: In a series of video clips uploaded by Frank Degods, a notable NFT creator and influencer, Trump expressed his support for the crypto industry.Addressing a group of buyers of his NFTs, Trump contrasted his approach with that of President Joe Biden: “I’m fine with it,” Trump stated, adding, “If you like crypto in any form… if you’re in favor of crypto you’d better vote for Trump.” His comments were met with enthusiasm from the crypto community.The remarks were reportedly made during a gathering organized by Trump to meet with purchasers of his “Mugshot Edition” NFTs. Attendees, who individually acquired over 47 NFTs priced at $99 each, were treated to dinner with the former president. Trump emphasized his role in revitalizing interest in NFTs, declaring, "We made NFTs hot again."Trump also addressed the issue of crypto firms leaving the US due to what he termed as “hostility” from Democrats and Securities and Exchange Commission Chair Gary Gensler. He emphasized the need to embrace these firms.Also Read: JPMorgan Analysts Optimistic About Future Approval Of Spot Ether ETFs Despite Regulatory HurdlesWhy It Matters: This marks a significant shift in Trump’s stance on crypto, having previously dismissed Bitcoin as a scam against the dollar in 2021. He also called crypto a “disaster waiting to happen” in 2021. The former President warmed up to digital assets over time, noting in March this year that he is “having fun with crazy new currencies.” Avichal Garg, Co-founder of Electric Capital, lauded Trump’s evolving stance on crypto, suggesting it could have implications for the political landscape. However, Trump's campaign declined to provide further comment on the matter.The comments come on the same day as President Biden’s announcement that he would veto a resolution seeking to repeal a Securities and Exchange Commission accounting policy, which makes it more expensive for financial institutions to custody digital assets.What’s Next: These topics are poised to be hotly debated at Benzinga’s Future of Digital Assets event on Nov. 19, where industry leaders will discuss the evolving relationship between cryptocurrency and mainstream politics.Read Next: Is Ethereum ‘This Cycle’s Basket Case’? 10x Research Points Out ETH’s ‘Only Bull Story’Image: Shutterstock

Ether Reverts to Inflationary Asset Following Fee-Reducing Dencun Upgrade

Ether was a deflationary asset following the Merge, with the total supply of the token dropping from 120.491 million to 120.097 million since September 2022. However, the total amount of fees burned decoupled from network activity following Dencun, meaning that the natural increase in supply is outpacing the amount burned in fees. Ether's supply has thus increased by 400,000 tokens since April.

Elon Musk Enables Dogecoin (DOGE) Payment for Tesla, Is DOGE Integration Imminent for X too? - Benzinga

Elon Musk has strongly supported DOGE for several years, dating back to his first tweet about the token in 2019. Since then, Musk has made multiple moves to incorporate DOGE into his various business ventures. Most recently, he has enabled DOGE as a form of payment for Tesla merchandise and is securing payment licenses for his social media platform, X. These moves signal that Musk is intent on providing DOGE payments on X, which could have a huge impact on the cryptocurrency industry. Don't Miss:In early May 2024, Musk and Tesla quietly enabled DOGE payments on the Tesla website. The new feature came after Musk visited the Berlin gigafactory, where he was asked about enabling DOGE payments. "We should enable that," Musk responded. Tesla customers can now send DOGE to the Tesla wallet in exchange for merchandise. Though Tesla did not formally announce the change, DOGE enthusiasts were quick to spot it and the price of DOGE rallied more than 20% in the following days. Additionally, Musk and X have been acquiring payment licenses in U.S. states. At the time of this report, they hold 25 licenses, and the count is growing monthly. These licenses are necessary for enabling peer-to-peer (P2P) payments, similar to how Venmo and Cash App operate. Also, an interesting anecdote from Musk's biography notes that he had dreamed of offering DOGE as a form of payment on a social media platform long before he even acquired X. So, the money transmitter licenses could indicate that the X team is moving closer toward DOGE payments on the platform.This idea was furthered by a retweet from Musk that had a picture of the old X.com logo next to the current X.com logo with the caption "The Everything App." The post was originally tweeted by a DogeDesigner on X. The account says that they work for DOGE, doing UX/UI design. Musk commented on the retweet saying, "The circle will be complete." The post currently has over 65 million views and 126,000 likes. The old X.com was a banking and payment website in the early 2000s that Musk founded. The company merged with Confinity to form PayPal, where Musk served a short stint as CEO. Flash forward to 2024, and Musk is hoping to complete the circle by bringing back the payment aspect of the original X.com. So, the signs point toward Musk wanting to offer DOGE as a form of peer-to-peer payment on the X platform. However, different regulatory hurdles could make this somewhat challenging. Acquiring the payment licenses is a very tedious and slow process. However, Musk seems determined to bring payments to the app and move closer to the "everything app" that he has envisioned for years. Read Next:

SEC Delivers Deadly Blow To Ripple’s Latest Stablecoin Project | Bitcoinist.com


								Ripple has run into problems once again with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) following the announcement of its highly anticipated stablecoin. The stablecoin, which is to be pegged to the US dollar, is expected to give established stablecoins such as Tether’s USDT and Circle’s USDC a run for their money. However, the SEC is less than pleased with this launch, going after Ripple before it even launches.
SEC Says New Stablecoin Qualifies As Securities Offering
In April 2024, Ripple announced that it is launching its very own stablecoin that will be pegged to the US dollar. This stablecoin launch came as part of the company’s continuous expansion worldwide, as it continues to spread its wings in the payments sector.
CEO Brad Garlinghouse had revealed that the company’s reasoning behind the launch was to help combat the de-pegging events in stablecoins through the years that have cost crypto investors billions. While this sounds like a noble endeavor, the US SEC is less than pleased.
According to the regulator, the stablecoin which Ripple plans to launch qualifies as an unregistered crypto asset. This was made known in a redacted brief filed by the SEC in the ongoing legal battle with the crypto firm.
The regulator’s most recent allegations tie back into its claims that XRP, which was launched in 2012, qualifies as an unregistered security offering. The SEC argues that Ripple has built its business on offering unregistered securities to investors, and its latest stablecoin project falls under that umbrella as well.
“Ripple’s primary business continues to be, as it has been since 2013, unregistered sales of XRP. It also plans to issue a new unregistered crypto asset,” the filing read. Given this, it seems the regulator is trying to stop Ripple ahead of launch, which is scheduled to happen toward the end of 2024.
The State Of Ripple’s Lawsuit
Even though Ripple has been able to secure a number of partial victories against the SEC in the last year, such as Judge Analisa Torres ruling that secondary programmatic sales did not qualify as a securities offering, its battle with the regulator is far from over.
A settlement is expected between both parties, but even that is proving to be a challenge. The SEC is demanding a $2 billion fine to be levied against the crypto firm as an appropriate amount for the ‘violations.’ However, Ripple has fired back against this, offering only $10 million, which the regulator has called a “slap on the wrist”.
Both parties are currently in the remedies stage, filing their briefs along with their supporting exhibits. Given this, Ripple CLO Stuart Alderoty believes that the almost 4-year long battle is coming to an end. “The good news is that we are closer than ever to putting this lawsuit behind us,” Alderoty stated in an X (formerly Twitter) post.

                        The tokenization of real-world assets (RWAs) may be the next “killer use case” for the crypto industry.Investment bank Citi released a report in March 2023 showing that the market for RWAs is projected to reach $4 trillion to $5 trillion by the year 2030. The report notes that the potential for tokenization via blockchain is transformative, yet the technology is still not at the point of mass adoption. While this may be the case, industry experts believe that artificial intelligence (AI) solutions could push tokenized RWA use cases forward.
Understanding Tokenized RWAs
RWA tokenization has been a long-time concept and dates back to 2018 when security token offerings (STOs) were all the rage. Fortunately, today’s tokenized RWAs differ from previously seen STOs, which were largely unregulated.Dave Hendricks, CEO and Co-founder of Vertalo, told Cryptonews that RWAs now have a degree of tangibility.“If a custodian can’t hold on to the asset legally, and if it’s not considered a high-quality liquid asset by banks for international settlements, then some might not even consider that an RWA asset in the traditional sense,” explained Hendricks.Hendricks added that Vertalo – a digital transfer agent and enterprise software platform – has been tokenizing RWAs since 2018. According to Hendricks, tokenization use cases are an important part of the decentralized finance (DeFi) ecosystem.He noted that use cases like stablecoins differ from tokenizing valuable and scarce assets like art, diamonds, or real estate.“Assets like art, diamonds or even real estate can now be fractionalized via tokenization,” said Hendricks. “Investors can now own part of that asset and receive income from the lease or use of the asset. When you tokenize an asset, each token represents a percentage of the asset.”
Benefits of Tokenized RWAs
While Hendricks pointed out that tokenizing RWAs makes assets more easily tradable, he noted that a tangible benefit of tokenized RWAs lies in their transparency and mid/back-office applications within the traditional asset management function.“This is why we are now seeing large financial institutions looking at improving asset management functions using distributed ledger technology,” he said.This appears to be the case, as the world’s largest asset manager, Blackrock, recently led a $47 million funding round for Securitize. The company focuses on bringing physical and traditional financial assets onto the blockchain.Payments giant Mastercard also announced on Wednesday that it will test new distributed ledger technology to enable tokenized asset settlement between its entities. In a May 8 statement, Mastercard said the project is focused on increasing the efficiency of cross-border settlements and reducing the chance of error and fraud.
How AI Can Help Tokenized RWA Use Cases
While it’s notable that the tokenization of RWAs is gaining traction, industry experts believe that AI will help advance use cases.Meysam Alizadeh, Senior Researcher at the Digital Democracy Lab at University of Zurich and CEO of Coinfident, told Cryptonews that AI can help with RWA token trades.For example, Alizadeh mentioned that AI can enable asset value prediction.“Imagine a venture capitalist (VC) that manages multiple startups and RWAs and uses them to back a token,” said Alizadeh. “In this case, given the availability of a VC’s portfolio, AI can be used to predict the future values of its assets and RWAs of its startups, or to predict demand for their services.”Alizadeh added that this can help traders have a better understanding of the future valuation of a VC’s portfolio.“This could result in a better valuation of its RWA token,” he said.
Using AI for Predictive Pricing of RWAs
To put this in perspective, Jacques Voorhees – CEO and Founder of tokenization platform RealCap – told Cryptonews that RealCap would soon be using AI to help determine the price of RWAs.Voorhees explained that RealCap initially began tokenizing diamonds but noted that the platform now helps tokenize rare artwork and other unique assets.“When we started with diamonds, we didn’t need to use AI for price predictions,” said Voorhees. “But once RealCap began tokenizing RWAs with less available pricing information, we realized we needed an AI solution to help determine prices.”Voorhees elaborated that RealCap recently created a technology called “virtual fungibility,” allowing tokenized RWAs to be more tradable with reduced price discrepancies.Yet he noted that virtual fungibility requires AI to determine the price of certain RWAs.“Let’s say an investor wants to buy art,” he said. “They can go online to different galleries, but an investor still may not know what the best price is for a piece of art. You need an objective measure. AI can help with predicative prices of each piece of art in this instance.”RealCap is currently building and developing its AI solution to ensure predictive pricing.
Using AI To Streamline RWA Workflows 
Alizadeh further noted that AI could be applied to automate RWA workflow analysis.“One of the risks of RWA tokenization is smart contract bugs and vulnerabilities,” he said. “AI can help in two ways here – the technology can help to create reliable smart contracts, to streamline contract reviews and to detect potential bugs and compliance issues.”Natalia Karayaneva, CEO and Founder of Propy, told Cryptonews that Propy is using AI for this particular case.Propy has been tokenizing real estate since 2018 and has conducted over $4 billion in transactions across the United States. According to Karayaneva, Propy recently began using AI to streamline transaction timelines automatically.“Propy AI can read purchase agreements, create transaction trackers, and settle intelligent deadlines for deposits, loan approvals, and more,” said Karayaneva. “This level of automation ensures a smoother, secure, and more transparent property investment process, which is crucial as we integrate more into tokenized markets.”Alizadeh elaborated that AI is being applied for customer risk analysis for platforms like Propy and other tokenized RWA lending outlets.“AI can be used to evaluate the credibility of the borrower, taking into consideration the borrower’s past on-chain transactions and activities,” he said. “This is similar to the credit scoring system in the US, which banks use to evaluate the risk of the customers.”
Challenges Associated with Tokenized RWAs and AI
While AI will likely advance tokenized RWA use cases, Alizadeh warned that challenges may hamper adoption.For instance, he pointed out that data around the AI applications mentioned may not be easily accessible.“AI needs data to work, and limited data access decreases AI usability,” he said.Alizadeh further remarked that decentralized exchange users may not be required to undergo Know Your Customer (KYC) procedures. This may result in a lack of information about a user’s demographic and location, impacting a customer risk assessment AI model.“Another data access challenge is getting all on-chain transactions of a user,” added Alizadeh. “Since everyone can hold multiple wallets and the identity of wallet holders is not easily verifiable, it’s not easy to get all on-chain transaction history of a crypto user. Most of the solutions to these challenges may be in conflict with users’ privacy and need more research to overcome.”
Tokenization Challenges Beyond AI
AI aside, Alizadeh believes that the primary challenges associated with tokenized RWAs are regulatory issues and asset verification.“Tokenizing an asset, such as a building, could turn them into securities, potentially attracting strict regulatory scrutiny,” Alizadeh mentioned. “This would likely decrease the incentives of RWA tokens.”He added that the verifiable authenticity of the assets underpinning RWA tokens remains problematic.“Crypto traders often express skepticism about the validity of claims concerning a token’s real-world backing asset,” he remarked.With these challenges in mind, Hendricks explained that tokenized RWAs must be carefully structured to be successful.For example, he noted that most tokenized RWAs in DeFi are debt or loan instruments.“Many if not most RWA offerings are just loans where investors put in collateral and get paid back an interest rate,” Hendricks said. “This is very lightly regulated and anyone can participate in this model. However, there may be recourse if collateral is lost and value declines.”Hendricks added that a security can be created from a tokenized RWA if the underlying asset has a secured interest.“For example, if a startup is raising money to buy an asset and fractionalize it under Reg D requirements, it can generally be sold to accredited investors,” he said. “You would then have to go through KYC and AML procedures, which would create a significant speed bump. RWA by itself doesn’t solve this, unfortunately.”

Espresso and Polygon Labs partner to address rollup interoperability - Crypto Briefing




Espresso Systems, a shared sequencer developer, has partnered with Polygon Labs, an Ethereum layer-2 scaling solution. The collaboration is meant to build out and produce an aggregation layer (AggLayer) that could solve the problem of fragmented liquidity across interoperable rollups.AggLayer, first introduced in January, is designed to enable transaction verification across multiple chains using a process called “proof aggregation.” This ensures that transactions across its ecosystems are valid without relying on third-party bridging solutions. Documentation from Polygon Labs state that all transactions will be guaranteed on AggLayer, providing a seamless experience for users.“Blockchains today don’t look or feel like the Internet. Instead of a unified, highly scalable network, users face scaling limitations and bad UX due to fragmented liquidity and state,” Polygon Labs said.The Espresso Shared Sequencer is a decentralized system that serves as a sequencer and data availability point to connect a variety of L2s. With such an infrastructure, the credibility, interoperability, and alignment with Ethereum, are enhanced to better achieve autonomy, neutrality, and collaboration among EVM chains.“Our respective teams have been thinking deeply about layer-2 interoperability over the last year — it’s amazing to see our solutions converge in such a synergistic way,” Espresso Labs CEO Ben Fisch said in an interview.Other projects such as Nil Foundation are also building out either modular or integrated approaches to solving scalability in Ethereum. For comparison, projects such as zkSync are pursuing “vertical” scaling, while Nil Foundation is building on “horizontal” scaling with the idea of embedding the sequencer to a protocol to enable transactions across different shards.Espresso has received significant funding in the past, including $28 million in a Series B round led by a16z crypto. Notably, Espresso serves as a marketplace for shared sequencing, allowing rollups to auction the rights to build their blocks. This market enables rollups to offer sequencing timeslots to shared sequencers through an auction. Espresso, on this end, will act as the coordinator that unifies the interdependent rollups prior to settlement on Ethereum.

FTX Bankruptcy: Fallen Exchange To Amass up to $5,100,000,000 More Than What Users Lost at Time of Collapse - The Daily Hodl


								The bankrupt crypto exchange FTX now has holdings worth billions of dollars more than the legally approved claims made by its creditors.
A recently filed disclosure statement indicates that FTX’s bankruptcy estate estimates it will hold net distributable proceeds between $14.5 billion and $16.3 billion on September 30th, the projected start date for the exchange’s reorganization plan.










FTX only owes creditors approximately $11.2 billion, putting the bankrupt exchange’s creditors in a position to recover between 118% and 142% of their claim values, according to the disclosure statement.
However, FTX’s creditors’ digital asset claims are denominated in dollars and based on the near-bottom crypto prices at the time of the disgraced exchange’s collapse in November 2022. Crypto prices had cratered at the time due to the FTX turmoil and the related contagion spreading throughout the sector.
Bitcoin (BTC), for example, was trading at around $16,600 on November 14th, 2022, compared to $61,435 at time of writing. Ethereum (ETH) was trading at around $1,250, compared to $2,969, currently.
The increased dollar payouts for FTX creditors are thanks to the soaring crypto prices this year and the exchange’s sale of a stake in the AI (artificial intelligence) safety and research company Anthropic.
Disgraced FTX founder Sam Bankman-Fried was found guilty late last year of defrauding investors and mishandling billions of dollars worth of customer funds related to the multi-billion-dollar downfall of the exchange in 2022.
On March 28th, Judge Lewis A. Kaplan sentenced Bankman-Fried to 25 years in prison and three years of supervised release. He also ordered the 32-year-old to pay $11 billion in forfeiture. Bankman-Fried is appealing his conviction and sentence.

Binance Financial Penalty In Canada Is $4.3 Million For Unregistered Operations - Coincu



	

Key Points:




Canadian regulators fined Binance $4.3 million for failure to register as a foreign money services business and report large cryptocurrency transactions.



The Binance financial penalty comes amidst a series of legal challenges for Binance, including a $4.3 billion fine in the U.S. and former CEO Changpeng Zhao’s prison sentence.



Binance faces regulatory scrutiny globally and has ceased operations in Canada, with ongoing legal battles in Nigeria over money laundering allegations.




Canadian regulators imposed a C$6 million ($4.3 million) fine on Binance, the world’s largest cryptocurrency exchange, alleging two separate violations of financial regulations.





Binance Financial Penalty In Canada Comes With Other Challenges



According to the Financial Transactions and Reports Analysis Centre of Canada (FINTRAC), Binance failed to register as a foreign money services business despite multiple opportunities and neglected to report virtual currency transactions exceeding C$10,000. Between June 2021 and July 2023, Binance allegedly failed to report 5,902 crypto transactions over $10,000, along with their associated know-your-customer (KYC) information.



These violations were discovered using blockchain explorer tools. This Binance financial penalty closely follows its agreement to pay U.S. regulators a $4.3 billion fine for violating anti-money laundering laws and former CEO Changpeng “CZ” Zhao‘s four-month U.S. prison sentence for inadequate KYC/AML measures.



Binance Battles Regulatory Challenges Worldwide



Last year, Binance ceased operations in Canada, citing regulatory challenges. The exchange faces scrutiny from various regulators worldwide, including the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Binance previously pleaded guilty to violating U.S. anti-money laundering laws and agreed to pay a hefty fine. Additionally, Binance is embroiled in legal battles in Nigeria, where it faces accusations of money laundering and tax evasion.




The Binance financial penalty by FINTRAC is part of Canada‘s efforts to enforce financial regulations. Notably, Toronto-Dominion Bank recently faced a C$9.19 million penalty for compliance failings related to monitoring and reporting suspected money laundering and terrorist financing.



Under Canada’s Proceeds of Crime and Terrorist Financing Act, administrative penalties aim to encourage businesses to improve compliance rather than punitive measures.

                        In the latest Solana meme coin skyrocket, a new Apple-themed token has exploded 76,928% overnight following Apple’s new product launches.This article will provide an analysis of APPLE’s current price trends and look to see whether an innovative new meme coin, Dogeverse, represents a more promising investment opportunity at this time.The APPLE meme coin’s price has exploded amid the sensational launch of the latest iPad model, which has gone viral after its launch advert ‘CRUSH’ was met with a poor reception amongst consumers.It is worth mentioning that the meme coin, indeed, has no official affiliation with Apple the company in any capacity.Thus is the nature of the decentralized meme coin markets.
APPLE Price Analysis: As New Solana Meme Coin APPLE Surges – Is Skyrocket Heading for the Moon?
As price action continues to hammer to the upside, APPLE is currently trading at a market price of $0.00123 (representing a 24-hour change of +76,926%).This is a jaw-dropping move, as price action has sustained a major upside rallying structure for 16 hours after leaping out of rock-bottom support around 1 AM UTC on May 9.Constant pressure from $116k in retail investor volume has propelled APPLE to fire up in a skyrocket that has so far topped out around $0.00125.Now standing at a market cap of $1.22M, it seems likely that APPLE will continue to sustain upside moves.Although, it is worth noting that there is no way of telling whether the market is being manipulated or whether even the token is a honeypot scam being pushed higher by bots and insiders.For that reason, some concern emerges that such a rally could result in a thunderous dump which is why smart money investors are chasing more reliable Solana meme coin returns in an emerging project that has secured a whopping $13M in presale funding.Indeed, there is growing concern that such a dramatic rally might lead to a significant market correction.This has prompted savvy investors to seek more reliable returns in the meme coin space, particularly in an emerging project that has already secured an impressive $13 million in presale funding.
Next To Pump: Dogeverse – Over $13M Raised in Viral Meme Coin PresaleWhile Dogecoin price basks in the afterglow of fleeting Tesla support, the Dogeverse presale continues to gain traction. The latest presale statistics show that the project has raised over $13 million. Going by recent trends, this could just be the beginning of this upswing.Dogeverse offers better features than Dogecoin.Most importantly, it is the first multichain meme coin and will deploy on Ethereum, BNB Chain, Polygon, Solana, Avalanche, and Base, among other platforms.Moreover, Dogeverse, unlike Dogecoin, supports staking, meaning presale investors can diversify income streams from passive gains and decent DOGEVERSE yields.Buy DOGEVERSE Here

What Is Fantasy Top? The Ethereum Game on Blast Turning Crypto Twitter Into a Fantasy Sport - Decrypt

We’ve seen mash-ups of fantasy sports and NFT trading cards, but what about something with more crypto-native subject matter? Enter Fantasy Top.Built on Ethereum layer-2 network Blast, Fantasy Top takes the premise of fantasy football and other fantasy sports games, but swaps out pro athletes for crypto influencers. It’s like Crypto Twitter: The Game, and it’s more than just a surface-level riff on the social media sphere.Fantasy Top has gotten off to an electric start, dominating industry chatter while driving surging trading volume—and becoming one of the most profitable protocols or apps across all of crypto. Curious how to get started? Here’s what you need to know.What is Fantasy Top?Crypto Twitter often feels like a spectator sport, so it makes sense that someone turned it into a fantasy game. Fantasy Top takes the core premise of fantasy football, soccer, or baseball, and swaps in 120 (and counting) crypto influencers, traders, content creators, and personalities.Each “hero” in the game is based on a denizen of Crypto Twitter, and they get their own NFT cards minted on Ethereum layer-2 network Blast. You can buy and trade the NFTs, which come in multiple rarity levels and can be upgraded by acquiring multiple copies of a lower-level edition and trading them up. Higher-level cards come with a larger score multiplier.In Fantasy Top competitions, you’ll select a lineup of five owned NFT cards and lock it in. Scoring is based on the actual Twitter engagement of your industry “heroes,” amplified by your cards’ particular score multipliers, so there’s strategy involved in both buying up cards for your lineup and picking the best cross-section of crypto tweeters to place highly in a competition.Cards in Fantasy Top. Image: Fantasy TopRewards thus far include Ethereum (ETH), Blast Gold points that will go towards the network’s upcoming BLAST token drop, and FAN points, which may ultimately lead to future benefits on Fantasy Top—or perhaps an allotment of airdrop tokens.Do I need NFTs to play Fantasy Top?Yes, Fantasy Top requires NFT cards to play. You’ll need at least five to lock in a lineup for a competition, and at this point, there’s no option to play the game without the NFTs.Fantasy Top sells packs of cards with dynamic pricing based on demand (currently around 0.4 ETH, or nearly $1,200), or you can purchase individual cards from the app’s NFT marketplace.Fantasy Top is played via the website, and like with other fantasy sports, you simply set your lineup and then watch the points roll in. Your leaderboard placement at the end of each competition period determines your rewards.What can I win in Fantasy Top?With such significant demand right out the gate, the early rewards are substantial indeed. In the first “main competition,” Fantasy Top served up a total prize pool that included over $150,000 worth of ETH, potentially more than $2 million worth of Blast Gold (based on analyst projections), and other perks to players.And the crypto influencers who've become in-game heroes are seeing sizable benefits, too. A share of the overall pack sales, along with a cut of the marketplace fees, are paid out to the influencers.Less than a week after Fantasy Top’s mainnet launch on May 1, 2024, the game paid out $1.25 million worth of ETH (in total) to heroes, along with what’s estimated to be at least $25,000 worth of Blast Gold points.The futureFantasy Top is early and buzzy, but the team has already teased plans ahead for the future—and it also clearly has some kinks to work out along the way.One week after launch, the game has already added leagues, which split players up into Silver and Bronze categories based on their performance thus far. Rewards will apparently vary by league designation, with “rewards increasingly skewed towards the top performers,” according to a tweet.What’s ahead? More in-game heroes, apparently, along with an improved scoring model, a “whole array of sub-competitions,” and other “surprises” to come.But as Fantasy Top attempts to grow, it will also need to deal with the immediate problem of users (or external observers) “botting” tweets from the heroes, manipulating the scoring and leading to some early pivots as the team figures out how to handle it all.Some heroes have complained of being targeted by botters, and Fantasy Top already decided to end its first main competition early due to manipulation concerns. The game is built around social media engagement, so that’s something they’ll have to sort out if Fantasy Top is going to try and parlay this early buzz into a sustainable game model.Stay on top of crypto news, get daily updates in your inbox.

Stocks Rebound As Rising Jobless Claims Sustain Rate-Cut Hopes, Dollar Falls, Gold Rallies: What's Driving Markets Thursday? - Airbnb (NASDAQ:ABNB) - Benzinga

Wall Street is seeing a day of gains as all major indices traded in the green around noon in New York, driven by a surprising uptick in unemployment claims prompting speculation over Federal Reserve interest rate cuts.Jobless benefits rose from 209,000 to 231,000 in the week ending May 4, surpassing market expectations of 210,000 and reaching the highest level in eight months. Consequently, the U.S. dollar Index (DXY), tracked by the Invesco DB USD Index Bullish Fund ETF UUP, declined by 0.2% in reaction to the data, as market participants slightly increased bets on a September Fed cut. The S&P 500 index inched up by 0.1%, following Wednesday’s flat close, while blue chips of the Dow Jones Industrial Average climbed 0.4%, aiming for their seventh consecutive day of gains, the longest streak since December 2023. Small caps, tracked by the iShares Russell 2000 ETF IWM, increased by 0.5%. Gold surged by 1% and silver by 2.8% due to the lower dollar. Bitcoin BTC/USD saw a 1.4% increase.Elsewhere, the Bank of England kept interest rates unchanged, while flagging rising chances of imminent rate cuts as new inflation projections reveal that price pressures will fall below target in two years.

Bitcoin Surges Past $64,000 as Market Liquidity Swings; U.S. and Hong Kong ETFs See Bullish Inflows



                    

Bitcoin (BTC) saw a resurgence above the $64,000 mark on May 7 as it experienced significant liquidity on both sides of the order book.



This upward movement was identified from data provided by Cointelegraph Markets Pro and TradingView, which showed BTC escalating from a low of $62,864 at Bitstamp earlier in the day. 




The currency remained within a trading range that had been established since May 3. Despite this, the price fluctuations were rapid, creating a volatile environment that led to the liquidation of positions in both directions.



The late trading hours saw a focus on bid liquidity near $63,500 before Bitcoin reversed direction, targeting a more substantial liquidity pool roughly $1,000 higher, as per the data from CoinGlass.



Daan Crypto Trades, a recognized trader, commented on the behavior seen over the weekend, specifically the closure of the CME futures gap. 




“Took some hours after the futures re-open but got there on Monday which is something we tend to see quite often,” he mentioned, discussing the patterns observed.



Another trader, Skew, pointed out several crucial levels that should be monitored going forward. 



He noted, “Price currently still chopping around $64K,” in his latest market analysis, adding the importance of trading the monthly open and $61K as significant demand markers in the market, with a high timeframe pivot at $67K.



The recovery from recent two-month lows around $58,000 also marked a notable divergence from the 2021 bull market trend, when Bitcoin first reached similar levels.

This difference was attributed to strong spot buyer demand, as emphasized by Skew.



Regarding the ETF market, the narrative around U.S. and Hong Kong Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) turned bullish. 



On May 6, the day before the price surge, U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs, including the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC), witnessed substantial inflows. 



Data from Farside, a UK-based investment firm, revealed positive inflows totaling $217 million across all 10 spot ETFs. 



This influx marked GBTC’s first day of positive inflows since its conversion to an ETF.



The stability of inflows into the newly launched Hong Kong spot ETFs was also highlighted, with “very stable volume-wise with consistent $8-9 million,” as noted by popular commentator WhalePanda. 



He further added, “As long as inflows stays positive here the supply is getting scooped up so overall quite bullish.”

Bitcoin Price Struggles to Stay Above $62,000 despite Positive European Equity Rally



This ongoing Bitcoin volatility has forced Bitwise, an asset manage­ment firm, to advise caution, suggesting the­ halving event might have be­en a “sell the ne­ws” scenario. 

The cryptocurre­ncy market continues to defy e­xpectations. While European stocks surge­ to record highs, Bitcoin remains stubbornly stuck below the­ $62,000 mark. This comes despite the­ Bank of England (BoE) hinting at a potential summer rate cut, a move­ traditionally seen as positive for riskie­r assets like Bitcoin.
The major Europe­an and UK stock markets experie­nced a positive day on Thursday. London’s FTSE 100 reache­d a new all-time high, closing at 8,393 after a 22-point gain. The­ broader European Stoxx 600 index also had a positive­ day, rising 0.15% to 516.




This optimistic sentiment in traditional markets stands in stark contrast to the­ ongoing struggles of Bitcoin. The world’s most popular cryptocurrency has be­en unable to capitalize on the­ positive sentiments, hovering above the $62,000 mark.
BoE Interest Rate Impact on Bitcoin
The Bank of England opted to maintain interest rates at their current level of 5.25% for the sixth consecutive meeting. This “wait-and-see” approach reflects the central bank’s cautious stance on inflation. However, Governor Andrew Bailey offered a glimmer of hope, suggesting a rate cut as soon as next month if inflation falls in line with their forecasts.
“We’ve had encouraging news on inflation and we think it will fall close to our 2% target in the next couple of months,” Bailey said. “While we need more evidence of sustained low inflation before a rate cut, I’m optimistic things are moving in the right direction.”
Despite the prospect of a summer rate cut, analyst Myron Jobson of Interactive Investor tempers expectations. He emphasizes that a broader environment of higher-for-longer interest rates is unlikely to disappear anytime soon.
“Interest rates could remain higher for the next decade than they were in the decade after the 2008 financial crisis,” said Jobson. This could dampen the appeal of Bitcoin, which has historically thrived in low-interest-rate environments.
Bitcoin’s Post-Halving Volatility Persists
The Bitcoin halving e­vent, which ended on April 20th, cut the­ block mining reward by half. These halving e­vents have often le­d to significant price rises. For example­, the 2012 halving saw a 9,500% price increase­, and the 2016 event re­sulted in a 3,000% jump the following year. Howe­ver, the 2020 post-halving rally was more mode­st, with Bitcoin appreciating by 650%.
Before the­ recent halving, Bitcoin expe­rienced a volatile 110% price­ increase. The we­ek leading up to the e­vent saw a sharp 17% dip from $72,000 to $60,000. Contrary to expectations, the­ post-halving rally has not materialized. Bitcoin briefly re­ached $67,000 on April 24th but quickly fell back to $62,500 within three­ days.
This ongoing volatility has forced Bitwise, an asset manage­ment firm, to advise caution, suggesting the­ halving event might have be­en a “sell the ne­ws” scenario. Analysts from JPMorgan and Deutsche Bank share­ this view, projecting that Bitcoin could drop as low as $42,000 in the coming we­eks.

AI Coins represent one of crypto's fastest growing sectors
                        Many crypto tokens attached to top AI/blockchain projects are rallying hard ahead of Nvidia’s earnings report on May 22.Nvidia is the premier AI play in the stock market.The stock has an eye-watering market capitalization of $2.2 trillion and some of the highest returns of any asset.For comparison, Bitcoin pulls up most of the $2.37 trillion crypto market with a capitalization of $1.2 trillion.Nvidia’s stock is down 2% today, roughly in line with both Bitcoin and Ethereum’s ($ETH) depreciation over the last 24 hours. However, while Nvidia has only moved about 4% in the last month, several AI coins have exploded in the last seven days.Most of the top ten AI-related cryptocurrencies rallied by double-digit percentages over the past week.The $4.1 billion market cap Render ($RNDR) leaped nearly 40% to trade at $10.68.The only token in the sector that matched its performance was AIOZ Network ($AIOZ), which rose 35% to $0.8402.Multiple leading AI coins rallied between 20-30% this week. They include Arkham ($ARKM), Golem ($GLM), and Akash Network ($AKT).Other top ten AI cryptocurrencies posted intraweek gains of 10%: the $5.5 billion market cap sector leader Fetch.AI ($FET), alongside Ocean Protocol ($OCEAN), SingularityNET ($AGIX), and The Graph ($GTR). Worldcoin ($WLD) also had a good week. Although not an AI coin as such, the token—which hopes to bank the planet’s legions of unbanked by scanning their eyeballs, confirming and storing the data and giving crypto in return—is by Sam Altman.He’s also the CEO of OpenAI, the progenitor of the massively popular ChatGPT, so $WLD can be thought of as a proxy for OpenAI too.WLD rose 18% this week.

Binance Co-Founder Yi He Responded to WSJ Claims! - Bitcoin Sistemi

In today's news, WSJ claimed that Binance detected that popular market maker DWF Labs was engaged in market manipulation.
Based on the statements of a former Binance employee, WSJ claimed that Binance researchers manipulated the prices of DWF Labs' Yield Guild Game (YGG) token and at least six altcoins in 2023.



While DWF Labs X denied WSJ's claims, a Binance spokesperson also denied the news and told Cointelegraph:

“Binance categorically denies any allegation that its market surveillance program allows market manipulation on our platform. We have a robust market surveillance framework that detects and takes action against market abuse. Any users who violate our terms of use will be excluded; we do not tolerate market abuse .”

Sarcastic Thanks to WSJ from Binance Co-Founder Yi He!
A reaction to WSJ's manipulation allegations came from Binance co-founder Yi He. Yi He, who denied the allegations from the X account and stated that they had no privileged actions against any fund, said the following:






“We monitor market makers closely. We do not target any fund or market maker. However, there is great competition among market makers and there is a lot of fraudulent behavior.
Anyone who wants can pay money to advertise, but don't bother with me.
“We will ensure our own fairness and will not participate in such games, and will continue to report honestly to auditors and other regulatory authorities.”

Yi He made another statement after this post.
Stating that WSJ has consistently targeted Binance, Yi He said, “I would like to thank WSJ for its long-term investment in Binance. Because WSJ has been consistently reporting about us for a long time. “I am grateful to them for saving us their budget. However, while reporting this kind of news, WSJ did not report that Binance was assisting law enforcement and assisting in the arrest of Zkasino's main culprit. This shows that WSJ acted with bias.” said.

Bitcoin About To ‘Blow Higher’ Despite This Week’s Pullback, According to Glassnode Co-Founders - Here’s Why - The Daily Hodl


								The founders of crypto analytics platform Glassnode are predicting that Bitcoin (BTC) will soon soar even higher after being up 7% in the last week.
In a new thread, the co-founders of Glassnode, who go by the handle Negentropic on the social media platform X, tell their 62,900 followers that key indicators suggest Bitcoin is gearing up from a massive breakout.










The analysts say Bitcoin appears to be forming a bullish pennant pattern. They also suggest that Bitcoin is correcting to a Fibonacci retracement level, in the low $60,000 range, which often predicts a continuation of an upward trend.
“BTC still looks like it is about to blow higher! Last week’s candle was a reversal candle – a hammer with a long wick. Price moved back into the pennant structure. This candle still dominates the structure. This week’s pullback, hence, seems like a healthy correction before higher. Corrections often pull back either 50% or 61.8% of the previous impulse move.”
Source: Negentropic/X
Looking at their chart, the analysts suggest that Bitcoin has or is about to complete a three-wave ABC correction. The Elliott Wave theory states that a bullish asset often witnesses a fresh leg up after an ABC correction of three wave impulses.
The analysts believe Bitcoin could break through the $85,000 level before the start of summer, which officially begins on June 20th.
“BTC is currently in the process of breaking the trendline of pennant and the 50-day SMA (simple moving average). When the level of $65,000-$66,000 is broken, BTC will move on to first $73,500, then $76,500, and chances are that we see $85,200 before the summer.” 
Bitcoin is trading for $62,016 at time of writing, down slightly in the last 24 hours.

New Shibarium Node Validator K9 Unfolds 420M KNINE Giveaway - DailyCoin


        
Freshly-appointed Shibarium validator K9 launches 420M KNINE contest.



The sweepstakes will run for two weeks, ending at 3 PM EST on May 22, 2024.



SHIB consolidated at $0.000022 as most altcoins pulled back on Thursday.
Shiba Inu’s (SHIB) upcoming Liquid Staking Derivatives (LSD) platform on Shibarium Layer-2 has awakened the curiosity of Shiba Inu custodians. K9 Finance DAO, the decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) behind the dynamic staking platform, launched a contest with 420M KNINE tokens up for grabs in the prize pool.The sweepstakes is being held in celebration of K9 Finance DAO becoming a node validator on Shibarium L2. This adds an extra layer of security to SHIB’s own blockchain after the hard fork in early May 2024. Moreover, the close partnership with SHIB Token lets K9 Finance DAO work on bolstering Shibarium’s liquidity by bringing unprecedented functionality to the chain.How to Get Your Hands on 420M KNINE Prize PoolCryptocurrency aficionados should head to TaskOn, where they can find a task list of mandatory and optional activities. In order to participate, SHIB Army members can log in to TaskOn in multiple ways, including Web3 and social media gateways. 
Shibarians can choose from X, Telegram, Discord, or email as an authentication method, while MetaMask, Bitget Wallet, Wallet Connect, and TronLink are the options for authentication via Web3. Once logged on, crypto enthusiasts are presented with two mandatory tasks.The first task revolves around swapping at least $100 of ETH to KNINE on UniSwap v3; the buying action follows the social task to quote a tweet, including the hashtags #K9Finance and #buycontest on Twitter. As the sweepstakes are run on raffle-based entries, the chances can be improved by doing optional tasks on the contest page.
These include following the campaign’s host, K9 Finance DAO, on Telegram and Twitter. Users can complete the smaller tasks worth five entries by following the SHARBI token, ChewySwap, Bad Idea AI, WoofSwap, CoinMerge, and other Shibarium-related products to gather all possible points.What K9 DAO’s Staking App Brings to ShibariumK9 Finance DAO serves the same purpose as Lido Protocol on Ether (ETH). When Lido entered the largest Proof of Stake (PoS) network, blockchain aficionados could diversify their digital asset staking portfolios across different smart contracts, magnifying the potential returns. K9 Finance DAO’s core product, BONE Crusher, is set to employ Shibarium’s Bone ShibaSwap (BONE) in a dual token system. Once Shibarium L2 users delegate their BONE to the BONE Crusher decentralized application (dApp), they get an equivalent of knBONE, the in-app version of Shibarium’s gas fee token.While the liquid yield project aims to bolster Shibarium’s on-chain liquidity, the participants can collect their staking rewards in both KNINE and BONE. Set for a Q3 of 2024 launch, the BONE Crusher dApp will run on Shibarium L2 and employ a bi-folded LSD system that rewards both the SHIB Army and K9 Army for participation in staking activities.On the Flipside
Two months into launch, K9 Finance DAO’s KNINE token backtracked 89% from its all-time high of $0.0003468, which was reached on March 10, 2024.



With a global market capitalization of $4,111,158, KNINE can be traded on MEXC, BitMart, and decentralized crypto waters.
Why This MattersSHIB Token’s leading team members have joined K9 Finance DAO’s advisory board, acclaiming the forthcoming liquid staking project as an official component of the Shibarium Ecosystem.Check Out DailyCoin’s popular crypto stories:“Crypto Is a Garden of Snakes:” Rep Sherman Backs SEC ActionFTX Pens Plan Promising 118% Cash Back to Creditors

ETH Founder Buterin Charts New Territory with Ethereum Gas Pricing Overhaul - Coin Edition


							

Multidimensional gas pricing enhances Ethereum’s scalability by decoupling resources for tailored pricing.
The introduction of “blobs” in Ethereum’s Dencun hard fork showcases the potential of multidimensional gas pricing.
Balancing scalability and security remains a challenge, especially in accommodating stateless clients’ storage proofs.




In Ethereum’s ongoing quest for scalability and efficiency, Vitalik Buterin has recently explored the concept of multidimensional gas pricing in a blog post. Gas, traditionally a singular measure encompassing various computational efforts within the Ethereum network, has been subject to scrutiny due to its limitations in accurately representing different resource constraints.







Buterin highlights the inefficiency stemming from the one-dimensional nature of gas pricing, which fails to account for the distinct safety limits of various network resources. This oversight can lead to either the exclusion of safe blocks or the acceptance of unsafe ones, hindering overall throughput by a substantial margin.



A novel approach introduced in Ethereum Improvement Proposal (EIP)-4844, termed multidimensional gas, has sparked significant interest. This approach decouples resources such as computation, data bandwidth, and storage, allowing for separate pricing mechanisms tailored to each resource’s unique constraints.









The introduction of “blobs” in the Dencun hard fork exemplifies the potential of multidimensional gas pricing. By allocating separate space for rollup-friendly data within blocks, transaction costs on rollups have plummeted, transaction volumes surged, and theoretical block sizes expanded marginally, all while maintaining network safety.



Looking ahead, the impending challenge of accommodating stateless clients necessitates a similar reevaluation of gas pricing. With storage proofs becoming a focal point, the Ethereum community faces the dilemma of balancing scalability with security.



Buterin proposes a paradigm shift towards floating prices for state size-increasing operations, offering a nuanced approach to managing network resources. By setting floating prices to target specific average usage levels, Ethereum could mitigate long-term scalability concerns without imposing rigid per-block limits.



However, implementing multidimensional gas pricing poses technical challenges, particularly concerning gas limits in sub-calls within the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM). While solutions like EIP-7623 offer incremental improvements, achieving a comprehensive multidimensional pricing scheme requires careful consideration of backward compatibility and protocol economics.

Robinhood CEO Speaks After SEC's Wells Reporting! Supported Cryptocurrencies! - Bitcoin Sistemi

As it is known, the SEC recently sent a Wells Notice to the US-based cryptocurrency platform Robinhood.
While the possible effects of the Wells Statement on the crypto market continue to be discussed, a statement came from Robinhood Co-Founder and CEO Vlad Tenev.



Speaking to CNBC, Robinhood CEO made statements about the SEC's latest actions.
Stating that cryptocurrencies are becoming increasingly popular and important, Tenev argued that Americans should have access to cryptocurrencies.





The famous CEO, who thinks that it is unacceptable for Americans not to have access to cryptocurrencies, stated that they met with the SEC 16 times before receiving the Wells Notice.
Vlad Telev said that as a result of these meetings, they learned that Robinhood would face SEC sanctions in the future.



“We tried to create what is called a special purpose broker-dealer for the purpose of trading cryptocurrencies.
And we actually came to meet with the SEC in good faith. I think we met with the SEC 16 times.
However, these talks did not yield any response and we learned that we would face SEC sanctions.
The SEC has the ability to change the rules to allow brokers to trade cryptocurrencies, but it does not appear to have any intention of doing so. Rather, the SEC continues to regulate through enforcement. And that's disappointing.
“I didn't want to be in this situation with the SEC, but we have to defend ourselves and our customers.”

CryptoQuant CEO Predicts Where Bitcoin Price Is Headed, Is $265,000 Too Ambitious?


																Ki Young Ju, CEO of cryptocurrency analysis firm CryptoQuant, has given an ultra-bullish prediction for Bitcoin. The crypto founder alluded to certain factors that could spark the flagship crypto’s rise to such heights. 
Bitcoin Could Rise To As High As $265,000
Young Ju mentioned in an X (formerly Twitter) post that “Bitcoin’s network fundamentals could support a market cap three times its current size compared to the last cyclical top.” He added that this development could help BTC rise to $265,000. The fundamental that the crypto founder was alluding to was the Hashrate/Market Cap ratio.

 

Source: CryptoQuant
The accompanying chart that Young Ju shared showed that Bitcoin’s hash rate is currently more than three times what it was at the last market cycle top. Meanwhile, BTC is still at the price level it was during that period. As such, the CryptoQuant CEO believes that Bitcoin could also see a 3x increase in its price, just like the Hash rate. 
Young Ju’s prediction provides a much-needed bullish outlook for Bitcoin, especially given the flagship crypto’s recent decline and talk that Bitcoin may have already attained the market top for this cycle. Tom Lee, co-founder of research firm Fundstrat, also recently shared his bullish sentiment towards BTC, stating that the crypto token will still reach $150,000 this year. 
Meanwhile, similarly to Young Ju’s prediction, crypto analyst MacronautBTC had previously stated that Bitcoin could rise to $237,000. The crypto analyst made this “conservative” calculation based on BTC’s demand outpacing its supply in the long run, especially with the halving further reducing Miners’ supply. 
A Rise To $265,000 Not Ambitious
Young Ju’s prediction of $265,000 for Bitcoin is far from ambitious when considering that Samson Mow, the CEO of JAN3, predicted that Bitcoin could rise to as high as $1 million this year. He explained that this unprecedented rise was possible due to the impressive demand that Bitcoin was currently enjoying. 

Pseudonymous crypto analyst PlanB also echoed a similar sentiment, stating that BTC hitting $1 million is possible, although he suggested that could happen in 2025 rather than this year. He made this prediction based on the Bitcoin stock-to-flow (STF) indicator, which hints at $500,000 being the average price level for Bitcoin in this market cycle. 
As such, the analyst believes that $1 million could be the market top for this bull run. Meanwhile, PlanB mentioned that Bitcoin hitting $100,000 this year was “inevitable.”
At the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading at around $61,700, down over 1% in the last 24 hours, according to data from CoinMarketCap.

Binance co-founder and DWF Labs speak out against market manipulation allegations

Amid new allegations of market manipulation brought by The Wall Street Journal, both Binance co-founder Yi He and market make DWF Labs have denied any involvement. In an X post on May 9, He described the media report as an occurrence that “greatly increased our exposure and saved us a lot of marketing budget.” However, the co-founder denied any of the allegations made against Binance, writing: “I have noticed an interesting phenomenon where some mainstream media articles are increasingly driven by emotions and biases rather than facts. For example, the complaints of former employees can become the basis of an article, while Binance’s proactive assistance to law enforcement agencies in investigating and apprehending the mastermind behind Zkasino (as a matter of fact) is not deemed worthy of reporting.”In a similar post the same day, DWF Labs said the allegations were “unfounded and distort the facts” and that the firm “operates with the highest standards of integrity, transparency, and ethics, and we remain committed to supporting you and our over 700 partners across the crypto ecosystem.” Earlier on May 9, a Wall Street Journal report claimed that DWF Labs, one of Binance’s largest trading clients, engaged in market manipulation, wash trading and inflated trading volumes amounting to $300 million through deals with crypto projects. After the exchange’s surveillance team recommended offboarding the client, Binance allegedly sided with DWF Labs and fired the investigator, arguing insufficient evidence for the claim.“We affirm our strict market surveillance program [and] do not tolerate market abuse,” He commented. “Over the last three years, we have offboarded nearly 355,000 users with a transaction volume of more than $2.5 trillion for violating our terms of use,” He added, continuing: “Market maker competition is fierce, and our investigation team’s job is to be neutral and look at the evidence without any bias, including bias that might come from market-making firms’ claims against their competitors.”DWF Labs is a prominent trading firm in the crypto industry. Founded by Andrei Grachev in 2021, the firm invests in promising projects and provides long-term financial support. Related: Binance denies reports of DWF Labs market manipulation

Biden backs Gensler as House advances resolution to power-check SEC - Blockworks


President Joe Biden has promised to back Securities and Exchange Commission Chairman Gary Gensler after a resolution to overturn an agency accounting practice advanced out of the House Wednesday evening. 
The House on Wednesday approved joint resolution 109 — which would invalidate the SEC’s Staff Accounting Bulletin (SAB) 121 — in a 228-182 vote. The measure now moves on to the Senate, but Biden’s administration warned it would veto the resolution if it makes it to the president’s desk.
“Limiting the SEC’s ability to maintain a comprehensive and effective financial regulatory framework for crypto assets would introduce substantial financial instability and market uncertainty,” the Biden administration wrote in a statement Wednesday. 
SAB 121, introduced in March 2022 and enacted the following month, states that digital asset custodians should report a liability and “corresponding assets” on their balance sheets for all custodied cryptocurrencies. The practice, SEC staff said, is intended to guard against the “significant risks and uncertainties associated with safeguarding crypto assets.” 
Reps. Mike Flood, R-Neb., Nick Wiley, D-N.C., Tom Emmer, R-Minn., Darren Soto, D-Flo., and French Hill, R-Ark., introduced the joint resolution in the House in February. 
“The SEC issued SAB 121 without conferring with prudential regulators despite the accounting standard’s effects on financial institutions’ treatment of custodial assets, and the SEC issued SAB 121 without going through the notice-and-comment process,” Rep. Flood said of the resolution in a statement earlier this year. “In the face of overreach by a regulator, it is the role of Congress to serve as a check.” 
Read more: SEC failed to follow the Congressional Review Act, may have broken the law
While SABs are not enforceable rules under securities law, they are used by staff for interpretations and practices, the SEC said. Unlike traditional rules issued by the agency, SABs do not require public notice or comment periods and do not reflect the official approval of Commissioners, a point Flood and his co-sponsors find troubling. 
All voting House Republicans were in favor of passing the joint resolution Wednesday. 21 Democrats also supported the measure.
Senator Cynthia Lummis, R-Wyo., a long-time crypto supporter, introduced a companion joint resolution in the Senate, although she lacked bipartisan support. Lummis’ effort has not advanced to Committee markup or a vote, and now that the House’s resolution is making its way to the Senate, the measure is all but dead. 
Gensler in December 2023 defended SAB 121, saying it was “just a staff accounting bulletin,” and it is consistent with precedent set in US bankruptcy court. 
Read more: Empire Newsletter: The SEC’s internal rift
“It basically addresses whether liabilities should be on balance sheet, and what we have found actually in bankruptcy court, time and again, many times now, that indeed bankruptcy courts have said that crypto assets are not bankruptcy remote,” Gensler said during a Dec. 2023 appearance hosted by the American Bar Association. 
Gensler, who has previously denied that he is working against the clock, could face significant headwinds in advancing his agenda after this year’s election. Should Republicans gain control of both chambers in November, additional efforts to overturn and undermine agency policy are likely to continue.

Scammer's Regret? $71 Million Bitcoin Thief Sends Ethereum to Victim - Decrypt

We do the research, you get the alpha!Get exclusive reports and access to key insights on airdrops, NFTs, and more! Subscribe now to Alpha Reports and up your game!Go to Alpha ReportsThe Ethereum user who accidentally sent $71 million worth of Wrapped Bitcoin to the wrong address last week—after being hit with an apparent “address poisoning” scam—may be about to get their money back. Or at least some of it.On May 3, address 0x1E227 sent 1,155 Wrapped Bitcoin (WBTC)—about $71 million worth—to a scammer’s crypto address, after being fooled into thinking the recipient's address was one of their own. The victim has been corresponding with the thief over the blockchain ever since, and was partially refunded with 52 ETH ($156,000) early Thursday.“Please leave your Telegram and I will contact you,” wrote the thief within the blockchain transaction on Thursday.The attacker initially stole the funds through a popular technique called “address poisoning” or “wallet contamination.” This involves a scammer sending a zero-value transaction to a target’s wallet from a crypto address purposefully picked to look like one that the victim regularly corresponds with.In this case, both the victim’s real target address and the scammer’s address began with characters 0xd9A1, and ended with 853a91, making them difficult to tell apart at first glance within most wallet apps.The scammer’s goal is to bait the victim into copying the fake address from their transaction history the next time they intend to send themselves money, and to intercept that transfer for themselves.After losing the funds last Friday, the victim initially messaged the thief to admit that they “won”, and asked that they return 90% of the money, keeping 10% as a clean reward.“We both know that $7 million will definitely make your life better, but $70 million won't let you sleep well,” the victim wrote.The scammer responded by demanding the victim send the $1.6 million in DAI stablecoin remaining at the wallet address, or else they wouldn’t consider the offer. “If you don't, you won't hear from me again & I won't respond,” the scammer wrote.The victim followed up with threats to track down the hacker based on their transaction history if they didn’t take the initial 90/10 offer.“We both know there's no way to clean [these] funds. You will be traced,” the victim wrote. “We also both understand the ‘sleep well’ phrase wasn't about your moral and ethical qualities.”Onlookers joined in on the conversation, with one offering services to provide data about the hacker, such as IP addresses, in return for $100,000. Others came to the scammer’s defense, congratulating the theft and assuring them that the victim’s threat was a bluff—and calling the victim a “dumb, greedy whale.”Edited by Andrew HaywardStay on top of crypto news, get daily updates in your inbox.

3 reasons why Bitcoin traders say a BTC price trend reversal is overdue

Bitcoin (BTC) price is down 1.85% over the last 24 hours and currently trades 17% below its all-time high of $73,835 reached on March 14.BTC/USD daily chart.

Bitcoin’s monthly chart shows the current price range is retesting an area that acted as a resistance when the BTC hit previous all-time highs, as observed by popular analyst Rekt Capital.According to Rekt Capital, this area is now acting as support for BTC since last month’s halving sell-off did not pull the price below this range.“On the monthly timeframe, Bitcoin is still retesting the old All Time High major resistance area (red) as new support (green).”BTC/USD monthly chart. Source: Rekt CapitalFellow analyst Moustache made the same observation, sharing a BTC/USD three-day chart showing that the price was trading at a level close to the previous all-time high.According to Moustache, this has happened only twice in the past—in 2017 and 2020. In both cases, previous all-time highs supported Bitcoin’s price, after which the coin went on a parabolic uptrend, hitting new record highs. Source: MoustacheIn another X post on April 25, Moustache commented on a similar set-up on the monthly chart, saying that BTC was going higher after retesting the line. “After reclaiming the line in 2012, 2016 and 2020, Bitcoin was just getting started. This will go much higher.”Whale accumulation backs Bitcoin’s potential upsideResponding to the market’s drawdown over the last few days, Bitcoin whales took advantage of the entry into the “prime buy zone” and bought more BTC in the dips, according to market intelligence firm Santiment.The analytics firm noted that addresses holding more than 1,000 BTC have “made some accumulation moves over the past 24 hours” as BTC ranged tightly between $61,000 and $64,000.In a May 9 post on the X social platform, Santiment said,“Wallets with 1K-10K $BTC have collectively accumulated ~$941M worth of coins, rebounding to their highest holding level in 2 weeks. ”Bitcoin 1,000-10,000 BTC chart holdings. Source: SantimentThis means large Bitcoin investors are “showing signs of confidence despite price drop to $62.000,” the on-chain data provider explained.

Robinhood CEO says SEC unwilling to facilitate crypto industry despite 'good faith'

Robinhood CEO Vlad Tenev voiced strong concerns about the limitations regarding the accessibility of crypto for Americans and criticized the SEC for its “regulation by enforcement” approach toward the industry.Tenev made the statement during a CNBC interview on May 9, where he also discussed the significant increase in crypto trading on the platform and the SEC’s recent Wells Notice against the firm’s crypto unit that claims it is selling unregistered securities.Regulatory hurdlesRobinhood’s crypto trading volumes surged 224% in the first quarter. Despite this growth, Tenev disclosed that the company’s discussions with the SEC had stalled after 16 meetings without any progress as the regulator did not engage in productive discourse.Tenev explained during the interview:“We tried to create what we call a special purpose broker-dealer for transacting in crypto assets… Unfortunately, a clear path forward with the SEC never emerged, and they did not reciprocate our efforts.”The failed discussions ultimately resulted in the SEC issuing a Wells Notice against the firm, indicating potential enforcement actions for alleged securities violations.Tenev expressed disappointment over the SEC’s decision to halt discussions and highlighted the regulator’s preference for “regulation by enforcement” rather than adapting its rules to facilitate the evolving crypto industry.He argued for regulatory adjustments to permit brokers to incorporate digital assets, a move he believes the SEC is currently reluctant to make.Tenev added that the SEC has the ability to change the regulatory framework for crypto but there seems to be no intent to do so from the regulator.Importance of accessThe Robinhood CEO framed the situation as a broader issue of consumer rights, stressing the importance of crypto and the necessity for Americans to have unfettered access to them.Tenev said the firm does not agree with keeping Americans out of the crypto industry, especially as it is becoming “more and more important.”The Wells Notice against Robinhood marks a significant moment in the broader discussion on how financial regulatory bodies should manage the growing crypto market.The conflict with the SEC places Robinhood at the center of a critical debate over the future of crypto regulation and the role of traditional financial oversight in an increasingly digital economy.Mentioned in this article

BitMEX Co-Founder Arthur Hayes Predicts Bullish Crypto Market Surge Ahead of U.S. Elections



                    

Arthur Hayes, co-founder of BitMEX, believes the next few months present a prime time for cryptocurrency investment, particularly for those with disposable fiat money. 



In an interview with Cointelegraph, Hayes emphasized, “Those people who have fiat and extra cash that want to allocate to crypto, this is the perfect opportunity to do so.” 




He sees the current stagnant market conditions as a golden chance to buy before the expected uptrend in the crypto market.



He attributes the anticipated rise in Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies later this year to inflationary monetary policies. 



Hayes suggests that these policies will play a central role in driving the market upwards.

He states, “Major economies around the world are going to print even more money between now and, say, the next 18 to 24 months,” signaling potential inflationary pressures that could increase the value of decentralized digital currencies like Bitcoin.



Furthermore, Hayes argues that the forthcoming United States presidential elections will act as a bullish catalyst for the cryptocurrency market. 



He believes that financial authorities in the U.S. will likely adopt looser monetary policies to aid President Joe Biden’s reelection campaign. 




Such actions, according to Hayes, will mirror past trends where monetary expansion was linked to rallies in the crypto market.



He explains the process by which governments can influence the economy and, by extension, the crypto market: “When you control the purse of the government, it’s very easy to do so by printing money, borrowing it, and handing it out to people in various forms.” 



This method of monetary manipulation historically correlates with increases in the cryptocurrency market, suggesting a similar outcome could occur in the upcoming election cycle.

DCG First Quarter Revenue Hits $229 Million Despite Grayscale's GBTC Slump - Coincu



	

Key Points:




Digital Currency Group (DCG) reports a strong Q1 2024 performance, with revenues reaching $229 million, marking a 50% year-over-year increase.



Subsidiaries Grayscale, Foundry, and Luno contribute to DCG first quarter revenue growth, despite challenges such as heavy redemptions and increased competition.



Grayscale’s revenue remains steady at $156 million, despite outflows of $17.4 billion post-conversion to an ETF.




According to Bloomberg, Digital Currency Group (DCG) showcased a stellar performance in the first quarter of 2024, posting revenues of $229 million.





DCG First Quarter Revenue Achieves Outstanding Performance



DCG first quarter revenue marks an impressive year-over-year surge of over 50% and an 11% increase from the previous quarter. The surge in revenues aligns with the broader resurgence witnessed in the crypto market during the same period.



Grayscale contributed significantly to the DCG first quarter revenue, accounting for $156 million. Despite facing heavy redemptions and a reduced management fee following the conversion of the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) to an ETF, Grayscale’s revenue remained steady from the previous quarter.



Foundry, another subsidiary of DCG, experienced a 35% increase in revenue quarter-over-quarter, attributed to higher revenue from staking and equipment sales. Similarly, Luno, DCG’s crypto exchange, saw a notable uptick in revenues, up by 46% to $16 million, driven by increased trading volumes amid heightened market activity.




Grayscale’s Steady Revenue Amidst Industry Shifts



The company highlighted key industry developments in Q1, including the approval of Grayscale’s GBTC and spot Bitcoin ETFs in the U.S., and Bitcoin prices hitting all-time highs in March. Despite facing outflows and increased competition, Grayscale’s revenue from GBTC exceeded expectations.



However, Grayscale witnessed outflows of about $17.4 billion since the conversion of GBTC into an ETF, as investors shifted assets to lower-cost funds offered by competitors. Despite this, Grayscale’s ETF still generated $156 million in revenues, reflecting the enduring demand for its products. The company attributed the flat revenue to the redemption and the drop in GBTC’s sponsor fee.



DCG’s robust performance in Q1 underscores the resilience and growth potential of the crypto industry, despite regulatory challenges and market fluctuations.

SEC Scuppers Exodus' Stock Debut in Sudden U-Turn - DailyCoin


        
The SEC has delayed listing the cryptocurrency wallet company Exodus’s stock exchange.



The SEC’s last-minute request for further review mirrors similar challenges other crypto companies face.



Exodus has remained hopeful for a swift resolution and may explore alternative listing options.
Exodus Movement Inc., a leading developer of self-custodial cryptocurrency wallets, hit a hurdle in its journey to a major stock exchange listing. The company announced that the NYSE American, originally slated for a May 9 Class A Common Stock debut, has postponed the listing.Exodus Follows Ripple’s PathThis development highlights the ongoing tension between innovation in the cryptocurrency space and regulatory oversight from government bodies like the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).
The SEC requested further review of Exodus’ registration statement at the last minute, causing the delay. Exodus remains hopeful for a swift resolution and indicated they might seek a listing on a national exchange after the SEC completes its review. In the meantime, trading will continue on the OTC Markets’ OTCQX exchange.“While we are surprised and confused by this last-minute decision, we remain hopeful that the SEC will follow through on its commitment to treat us as the law intends. Exodus has been fully transparent and responsive throughout this process and we expect a swift resolution in this matter,” Exodus CEO JP Richardson exclaimed.This incident isn’t isolated. Ripple, another prominent player in the cryptocurrency industry, faced similar challenges during their IPO plans. In January, Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse shelved the company’s public offering plans due to what he called a “hostile” regulatory environment in the US. Crypto Firms Struggle Against SECThis move followed a legal battle with the SEC, dating back to 2020, over allegations of unregistered securities sales. Referring to the difficulties faced by Coinbase, another major crypto company that encountered legal issues following its IPO despite initial SEC approval, Garlinghouse had this to say:“In the United States, trying to go public with a very hostile regulator that’s approved your S-1, that doesn’t sound like a lot of fun to me,” Garlinghouse stated. The SEC plays a critical role in safeguarding public offerings through regulations. The agency has historically taken a cautious approach towards the cryptocurrency sector. Their rigorous review processes have impacted other companies like Robinhood, which initially delayed its IPO due to SEC scrutiny of its crypto offerings. Robinhood eventually went public in July 2021.
The delay in Exodus’ listing underscores the challenges faced by cryptocurrency companies seeking mainstream recognition through traditional stock exchange listings. As the industry continues to evolve, navigating the complexities of regulations will remain a crucial hurdle for crypto businesses aiming for broader public participation.On the Flipside
A delay in stock exchange listing does not necessarily hinder a company’s growth. Exodus can continue trading on the OTCQX exchange and focus on other avenues for expansion.



Exodus can use this time to strengthen its product and user base, making it more attractive to future investors.
Why This MattersThis incident exemplifies the roadblocks cryptocurrency firms encounter when seeking legitimacy through traditional stock markets. The SEC’s scrutiny of Exodus and Ripple’s shelved IPO plans highlights the potential for regulatory hurdles to stifle innovation and hinder wider public adoption of cryptocurrency businesses.If you found the regulatory hurdles faced by Exodus concerning, then you won’t want to miss this:Grayscale Drops Ether Futures ETF Bid as SEC Stalls ApprovalAre you interested in the recent war on crypto?

                        Binance is fighting back against the DWF Labs allegation against the platform on May 9. This follows an explosive report from the Wall Street Journal (WSJ) that revealed that Binance dismissed an employee who uncovered evidence of market manipulation by DWF Labs, a major market on the trading platform.According to the WSJ report, the dismissed employee and his colleagues at Binance’s market surveillance team had identified instances of pump-and-dump schemes and wash trading conducted by “VIP” clients, including $300M by DWF Labs. These activities violated Binance’s terms and conditions.
Binance & DWF Labs Allegation Entails $300 Million of Wash Trading
The investigators recommended removing DWF Labs from the platform, which they accused of manipulating the price of several cryptos, including the YGG token.Instead, Binance launched an inquiry into the team’s work, claiming there was insufficient evidence of wash trading by DWF Labs. According to the WSJ, the head of surveillance was fired afterward.DWF Labs, an investor in crypto projects that gained prominence in 2023, was reportedly involved in trades of over $4 billion monthly on the Binance platform.In response to the allegations, Binance refuted the claims, asserting they do not tolerate market manipulation.The exchange also revealed its successful record of removing high-profile traders who broke the rules. Binance claimed to have removed over 355,000 users who violated its terms of service in the past. The exchange said the ousted market makers had a combined transaction volume of $2.5 trillion.
Binance & DWF Allegation Slammed as “Unfounded and Not Accurate”
DWF Labs released a Telegram announcement shortly after the WSJ report, which entails the rebuttal of the report that it engaged in price drive, artificial volume, and $300 million of wash trading on Binance in 2023.“It has come to our attention that a recent article contains many allegations that we believe to be unfounded and that do not accurately represent our ethical business practices,” the market-making firm stated. “We have always prioritized our relationship with our partners and the broader community, successfully supporting more than 700 portfolio companies in the crypto ecosystem. We take pride in being compliant, transparent, and diligent in our work.”Last year, Binance settled charges brought forward by multiple US regulators, agreeing to pay $4.3 billion in settlement over alleged violations of operating an unregistered exchange, insufficient controls over market manipulation, and commingling of funds.The US SEC’s litigation against Binance exchange resulted in a plea deal and a settlement of $4.3 billion for violating US anti-money laundering standards. Binance co-founder Changpeng Zhao (CZ) also stepped down as the CEO as part of the settlement. He has been sentenced to four months in prison with an additional fine of $50 million.

Tokenization to unlock interoperability across payments, investments

The lines between payment and investment assets are becoming increasingly blurred. In the near future, it may be possible to split a dinner and pay using shares of tokenized funds, a blend made possible by tokenizing assets.Rob Durscki, senior director of tokenization at the Stellar Development Foundation, shared the prediction during the TokenizeThis 2024 event in Miami on May 9. According to him, the bridge between payments and investments will unlock new utilities across financial products. Durscki noted: “What we’re seeing now with partners like Franklin Templeton, WisdomTree, and others issuing this new round of assets on-chain is that they want to unlock yield, [...] but they also want to make it almost seamless to use as a payment tool as well.”Tokenization is the process of converting rights or ownership of an asset, like real estate or stocks, into a digital token on a blockchain. This enables a digital representation of the asset, allowing for fractional ownership, increasing liquidity and making some financial products more accessible to small investors.“Nothing prevents us here from splitting the check on the dinner, and I’ll pay with Franklin Temple funds because I can send you $20 in 3.6 seconds on Stellar. [...] If you forget about that, you’re still getting 5%, 6% a year on that dinner. [...] This positive blur between investment and payment because it’s ultimately value, right? And we’re unlocking the movement of value.” TokenizeThis 2024. Source: Sam Bourgi/CointelegraphRipple’s vice president of engineering, Bradley Chase, also participated in the panel and spoke about customization trends emerging from enterprise customers. According to Chase, more and more enterprises are seeking to receive stablecoin payments and hold tokens on-chain as a way of generating additional revenue.“Those customers now have their own customers that want to pay in stablecoins and they want to hold those stablecoins. So that’s kind of the simplest on and off-ramp gateway for them into the space.”More than $1 billion worth of U.S. Treasurys has already been tokenized across Ethereum, Stellar, and other blockchains. A recent estimate from Ripple forecasts tokenized markets to reach $16 trillion in the coming years, a figure eight times larger than the total market capitalization of the entire cryptocurrency sector.

Crucial ETH and SEC Statement from Ethereum Co-Founder - Bitcoin Sistemi


Ethereum co-founder and cryptocurrency billionaire Joseph Lubin has expressed concerns about the US Securities and Exchange Commission's (SEC) approach to regulating the cryptocurrency industry. Lubin argues that the SEC's current stance could potentially “cripple” the industry's growth.
Lubin explained that the SEC appears to have reclassified Ethereum as a security without informing the public. The move has raised concerns specifically about ETH spot ETFs, which the SEC fears could flood the cryptocurrency ecosystem with excessive interest and capital.


The SEC also alleged that popular cryptocurrency wallets Coinbase and MetaMask acted as brokers. Lubin warns that this sets a dangerous precedent. “The SEC is now scouring the GitHubs of software developers who don’t even develop financial applications to find out which products can be classified as brokerage firms,” Lubin said.

Lubin believes the SEC's current regulatory approach is an “attempt to paralyze” the crypto industry. He argues that the SEC does not want Ethereum and other cryptocurrencies to shape the banking landscape.





Additionally, Lubin warns that the SEC's anti-crypto stance could cripple Ethereum's growth in the US, hindering acquisition and development. He argues that irrational regulations must be resisted for the sector to grow.

Bitcoin Traders Closing More Positions As Prices Range Above $60,000


																Bitcoin has been trending lower after failing to break above $66,000 in early May, deflating hopes of immediate price gains post-Halving. Taking to X, one analyst shared on-chain data that paints a more nuanced picture than a simple loss of confidence in recent weeks. 
Bitcoin Open Interest Remains Low: Bullish?
The analyst, pointing to CryptoQuant data, observes that leveraged traders on perpetual trading platforms like Binance appear to be closing their positions more than opening new ones. The analyst notes that the reading is at -20% at the monthly change in Open Interest.

At this level, it shows that more traders are closing more positions than opening new ones. This development suggests that most traders adopt a strategic wait-and-see, watching prices evolve.

Despite the decrease in positions opening, it’s important to note that this is not a sign of BTC’s downfall or the invalidation of a potential surge. The analyst interpreted this contraction as a strategic move by traders, who are cautiously optimistic and not exiting the market due to bearish expectations. 
In a separate post, the analyst added that the Bitcoin market needs the current wave of liquidation and “negativity” for accumulating short positions. All short positions opened at spot levels bet that BTC will continue trickling lower, even breaking below $56,500.

However, the more short positions there are, the higher the possibility of a “short squeeze” forming. When this happens, there will be a sudden price spike, liquidating shorts and forcing sellers to buy back into the market to prevent further damage. 
BTC Inside A Trade Range: Will $60,000 Fail?
Despite the potential upside hinted by on-chain data, prices remain confined within a narrow range. Last week, bulls failed to close above $66,000, confirming the impressive march from May 3.

Bitcoin found resistance and is moving lower toward the psychological $60,000 level. From price action, losses below this line might fast-track the collapse toward $56,500 registered in early May. 
Going forward, traders will closely monitor how prices evolve after the all-important Halving on April 20. Considering the approval of spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) and the involvement of institutions, some analysts expected prices to shoot higher immediately.

Nonetheless, this has not been the case. Prices continue to hang amid fluctuating inflows to spot ETFs, and the United States Federal Reserve is still not slashing interest rates.

Dencun Destroyed The Ethereum "Ultra-Sound Money" Narrative: CryptoQuant


								Researchers at CryptoQuant, a crypto analytics platform, are now disproving the idea that Ethereum is “ultra-sound money,” especially after activating the highly anticipated Dencun Upgrade in mid-March. 
Analysts observe that the hard fork has slowed the number of coins going to the “furnace.” Accordingly, ETH is now more deflationary, considering the rising daily supply over the past weeks. 
The Impact Of Dencun On Gas Fees
Analysts say the Dencun Upgrade was one of the major updates after The Merge. With Dencun, Ethereum developers introduced proto-danksharding for more efficient and cheap transaction processing, especially by layer-2 platforms like Arbitrum. 
Besides helping reduce gas fees for layer-2 solutions, the update enhanced the mainnet scalability. Accordingly, the primary layer could handle more transactions without congestion or gas fees spiking.

Though layer-2 gas fees have drastically fallen, activity on Arbitrum, Optimism, and Base have registered more activity. However, the problem with lower gas fees from layer-2 transactions, which are bundled and confirmed mainnet, means Ethereum is now increasing fewer coins. 
Ethereum price trending sideways on the daily chart | Source: ETHUSDT on Binance, TradingView
As such, ETH gradually becomes inflation after months of supply reduction, reflecting the adoption of the mainnet and off-chain solutions.
The rate at which ETH became deflationary pre-Dencun meant the “ultra-sound money” narrative was valid. Due to the rapidly falling supply, ETH, like BTC or gold, could become a store of value.
Ethereum Is Becoming Inflationary: Study
However, CryptoQuant data now paints a concerning picture. A report found that shrinking gas fees from layer-2 platforms translates to lower ETH being taken from supply. 
ETH supply rising after Dencun | Source: CryptoQuant
This “structural shift” researchers discovered, means that ETH supply is no longer decreasing as rapidly as before. In their assessment, they noted that in recent days, the ETH supply has been growing at the fastest daily rate since the Merge.
ETH burning post-Dencun is falling | Source: CryptoQuant
At this pace, if the rate of ETH burning continues to drop, Ethereum may no longer be on track to become deflationary. It will be especially so if activity shifts, as has been the case, to competition low-fee and scalable networks like Solana and Avalanche. 

Falling Ethereum and Bitcoin prices will further exacerbate the burn rate. Whenever prices crumble, on-chain activity tends to contract sharply over time.

Susquehanna’s portfolio also includes 256,354 shares of VanEck Bitcoin Trust (HODL) bought for $20.6 million, 255,814 shares of WisdomTree Bitcoin Fund (BTCW) valued at $19.3 million at time of purchase, 166,200 shares of Invesco Galaxy Bitcoin ETF (BTCO) acquired for $11.8 million and 192,391 shares of Valkyrie Bitcoin Fund (BRRR) worth $3.9 million.
In all, the trading giant with $481 billion in total assets under management (AUM) invested $1.31 billion in nine spot Bitcoin ETFs.
The SEC greenlit 11 applications to offer the BTC investment product in January, though it did warn that Bitcoin is still considered a volatile and speculative asset.

Canadian regulator fines Binance $4.4M for AML and CFT violations

The Financial Transactions and Reports Analysis Centre of Canada (FINTRAC) announced it was imposing a $4.4 million administrative monetary penalty on Binance for failing to register and report large transactions in digital assets.In a May 9 notice, FINTRAC said it had imposed penalties on Binance Holdings Limited for noncompliance with Anti-Money Laundering (AML) and Countering the Financing of Terrorism (CFT) regulations. According to the regulator, Binance failed to register as a foreign money services business and report digital currency transactions that exceeded $10,000. FINTRAC said it had fined Binance 6,002,000 CAD, or roughly $4.4 million at the time of publication. The regulator reported that Binance’s activities for incurring the fine happened in 2023 when it was winding down its operations in Canada. Cointelegraph reached out to Binance for comment but did not receive a response at the time of publication.Source: FINTRACBinance announced in May 2023 that it planned to leave the Canadian market, citing regulatory concerns. FINTRAC reported 5,902 separate transactions of $10,000 or more in crypto on the exchange from June 2021 to July 2023.“Binance Holdings Limited was provided with several opportunities to register with FINTRAC as an FMSB, however, they had not completed their registration by the deadlines provided,” said FINTRAC. “It should be noted that Binance Holdings Limited was deemed to be an FMSB and was required to be registered with FINTRAC up until September 25th, 2023, when it officially ceased all operations in Canada. Up until that day, Binance Holdings Limited was in violation of its registration requirements.”Related: Canada to begin implementing international crypto tax reporting standardThe $4.4 million penalty was separate from legal entanglements Binance has faced or is currently facing in other jurisdictions.

Changpeng Zhao stepped down as CEO as part of the deal and pleaded guilty to one felony charge. He was subsequently sentenced to four months in prison.In Nigeria, two Binance executives were arrested in February and face tax evasion and money laundering charges.

Major US City Handing $32,000,000 To Residents As Guaranteed Income Program Reboots - The Daily Hodl


								A major US city is preparing to relaunch a multimillion-dollar basic income program that will hand cash directly to residents.
Mayor Brandon Johnson says he is allocating $32 million to reboot the Chicago Resilient Communities pilot, reports CBS News.










The revived program seeks to hand out $500 per month for a period of one year to families experiencing financial struggles.
The mayor says funding will come from the $1.9 billion that the city received from President Biden’s American Rescue Plan Act (ARPA) in 2021.
The city of Chicago is giving the guaranteed income program new life in an effort to distribute the remaining ARPA funds or risk giving it back to the federal government next year.
Chicago Resilient Communities was initially launched by former Mayor Lori Lightfoot in 2022 to help 5,000 low-income households get back on their feet after the pandemic.
The Johnson administration has not yet divulged the qualification details for the rebooted program. Participants of the original pilot were Chicago residents at least 18 years old at time of enrollment, had a family income at or below 250% of the Federal Poverty Line and faced financial difficulties due to the Covid-19 pandemic.
The exact number of families that will receive the $500 monthly payment under the restarted program also remains unknown.

                        With cryptocurrency markets choppy on Thursday as Bitcoin (BTC) rebounds from session lows in the $61,000s back to the mid-$62,000s, traders are parsing through their options in the altcoin market as they hunt for the best crypto to buy now on May the 9th.Some attributed the bounce in Bitcoin from session lows to weaker-than-expected US jobless claims data.This data comes following last week’s softer-than-expected official US jobs report.But, in the grand scheme of things, Thursday’s Bitcoin bounce means very little for the near-term outlook.Bitcoin remains locked within recent ranges as traders monitor long-term market themes.These include spot Bitcoin ETF demand, the outlook for Fed rate cuts, the evolution of post-halving sell pressure (it is expected to eventually ease, potentially precipitating a major rally) and the upcoming US elections.Former President Donald Trump remains the favorite to resecure election. And that could be bullish for crypto.Just last night, Trump commented that “if you’re in favor of crypto – you better vote for Trump”.https://twitter.com/marionawfal/status/1788392597993496935Elsewhere, as Ether (ETH) pivots either side of $3,000, traders are focusing on its shifting supply dynamics.
Ether Turns Inflationary as Ethereum Fees Drop 
The recent Dencun upgrade has reduced Ethereum fees by as much as 4x, according to CryptoQuant data.That has substantially reduced the cryptocurrency’s burn rate, with the Ether supply recently turning inflationary as a result.This has concerned some ETH traders. Many see continued ETH deflation as a key value proposition for holding the cryptocurrency.However, these traders must remember the chilling impact that high fees has on Ethereum’s adoption.If Ethereum is going to retain its spot as the dominant smart-contract-enabled blockchain in web3, lowering fees is key.After all, why would everyday users choose to transact on Ethereum if fees are 100x higher than on other chains.
Will Token Unlocks Hit the Altcoins Markets?
Lower fees on Ethereum could also help breathe life into meme coins and altcoins.That being said, 10x Research fed the FUD on Thursday with a note postulating that the cryptocurrency bull market cycle might be shorter than previous ones, and unlikely to culminate in a broad altcoin rally.They cite nearly $2 billion in token unlocks which could lower the market in the coming ten weeks.Affected tokens include Aptos, Starkware, Arbitrum, Optimism and Ethena, which see between $50-100 million in unlocks, and Avalanche and Sui, which see $330 million and nearly $1 billion in unlocks respectively.Traders hunting for the best crypto to buy now will thus need to be selective.Here are some strong performers on Thursday that traders will be watching.
Best Crypto to Buy NowArweave (AR)
Arweave (AR) is a market leader on Thursday, up around 13% in the past 24 hours as per CoinMarketCap.Last at $41.70, the cryptocurrency is eyeing a break above recent highs in the $42,50 area.That could open the to a retest of March highs between $46.50 and $47.50.AR has found strong support at its 100DMA in recent weeks, suggesting the bulls remain in control.Arweave stands a good chance of testing its 2021 highs above $90 this bull market. Thus, it could potentially be the best crypto to buy now.AR bulls are in control and the crypto could be the best to buy now. Source: TradingViewRender (RNDR)
Render (RNDR) is another token with strong momentum, hitting new multi-week highs on Thursday above $11.Last up 12% in the past 24 hours as per CoinMarketCap, Render was last trading around $10.94.Render broke to the north of a pennant structure earlier this month and the bulls have since been in control.The prospect of a quick 23% pump makes Render potentially the best crypto to buy now. Source: TradingViewIt could soon retest its March highs in the mid-$13s.  The prospect of a quick 23% pump makes Render potentially the best crypto to buy now.
Toncoin (TON)
Toncoin (TON) is another very strong performer on Thursday, up 7.5% in the past 24 hours, as per CoinMarketCap.TON hit its highest level since mid-April on Thursday above $6.30, having founds support at its 50DMA earlier this week.The latest rally opens the door to a rebound back to TON’s all-time highs above $7.50.

                        Ethereum Co-Founder Joseph Lubin launched scathing criticisms against the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) on May 9, accusing the regulatory body of deliberately impeding innovation and obstructing Ethereum’s transformative potential in the banking landscape.Speaking at FT Live’s Crypto and Digital Assets summit in London, Lubin criticized the SEC’s approach, alleging that instead of fostering open discourse and providing clear regulatory guidelines, the SEC has opted for strategic enforcement actions, causing uncertainty within the cryptocurrency industry.“The SEC probably doesn’t want to see a wave of innovation that will really transform the landscape,” he said.
Joseph Lubin On Why SEC is “hindering Innovation.”
Lubin’s remarks were made in light of Consensys’s decision to sue the SEC after receiving a Wells notice from the regulator. Lubin asserted that the SEC’s actions, such as reclassifying Ether as a security without transparent communication, were designed to instill fear and doubt, potentially driving cryptocurrency companies offshore.“The SEC appears to have reclassified Ether as a security without telling anybody that that’s the case,” Lubin said. “They are going about a strategic series of enforcement actions rather than open discourse and clear rulemaking.”Central to Lubin’s critique is the suspicion surrounding the SEC’s motives, particularly regarding its recent enforcement actions against Ethereum. Lubin suggested that the impending decision to approve Ether spot exchange-traded funds (ETFs) has spurred the SEC’s intensified scrutiny, fearing the potential influx of capital into the Ethereum ecosystem.“We believe that there’s a flurry of activity designed to enable them to say that their action wasn’t capricious in the very likely event that they deny the Ether spot ETFs,” The Ethereum co-founder explained.In Lubin’s view, the SEC’s reluctance to embrace Ethereum’s advancements in scalability and usability stems from a desire to maintain the status quo, fearing the transformative impact decentralized finance (DeFi) could have on the banking industry.“I think they’re concerned that so much attention and capital will flow to our ecosystem, considering it is improving enormously in terms of scalability and usability,” he added.Lubin further argued that the SEC’s apprehension towards innovation reflects a broader reluctance to adapt to emerging technologies, potentially hindering the growth of the cryptocurrency sector.Additionally, Lubin cautioned against the SEC’s attempts to classify platforms like Coinbase and MetaMask’s wallets as broker-dealers, warning that such actions could set a dangerous precedent and stifle innovation across the technology sector.“We’re at odds over whether we should register MetaMask as a broker-dealer,” he said. “Should ever MetaMask user have to register their wallet as a broker-dealer, it’s chilling.”
SEC Will Most Likely Reject Spot ETH EFTs
The SEC recently decided to delay its ruling on the proposed Invesco Galaxy spot Ethereum exchange-traded fund (ETF). The new deadline for the decision is July 5, 2024. The SEC stated additional time is required to review the proposed rule change and the associated issues thoroughly.Similarly, Franklin Templeton’s application for a spot Ethereum ETF also faces an extended delay, with the SEC pushing the decision deadline to June 11, 2024.Several other issuers, including BlackRock, 21Shares with Ark, Fidelity, Grayscale, VanEck, Hashdex, and Franklin Templeton, have filed applications for Ethereum ETFs, adding to the market’s anticipation.Market analysts had initially speculated that the SEC would reach a final decision on spot Ethereum ETF applications during May, coinciding with deadlines for various asset managers’ submissions.The recent delays announced by the SEC have dampened these expectations, however. Bloomberg Intelligence analyst James Seyffart expressed skepticism, suggesting that the current round of Ether ETF applications might face rejection, altering the landscape for Ethereum investment options in the US.

‘Just a Bunch of Noise and Garbage’: Cardano Creator Blasts Biden's Stance on Planned Repeal of SEC Custody Law - The Daily Hodl


								The creator of smart contract platform Cardano (ADA) is calling out President Joe Biden’s stance on a planned resolution that would enfeeble the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).
In a new video update, Charles Hoskinson tells his 315,000 YouTube subscribers that Biden saying he would veto H.J. Resolution 109 if passed is “just a bunch of noise and garbage.”










“Blah blah blah just a bunch of noise and garbage. It’s one thing to have regulation by enforcement, it’s another thing to say that when the legislative branch comes together, talks to everybody, and comes up with proposals for how we as a nation can innovate and move forward, that you’ll just veto it.”
Earlier this week, the Biden Administration sent out a memo saying that the passage of HJ Resolution 109 would disrupt the SEC from being able to protect investors within the crypto markets as it would invalidate SAB 121, which provides regulations for entities holding digital assets on behalf of others.
In the statement, the Biden Administration said he would veto H.J. Resolution 109 if passed.
“H.J. Resolution 109 would invalidate SEC Staff Accounting Bulletin 121 (SAB 121), which reflects considered SEC staff views regarding the accounting obligations of certain firms that safeguard crypto assets… 
Limiting the SEC’s ability to maintain a comprehensive and effective financial regulatory framework for crypto-assets would introduce substantial financial instability and market uncertainty. If the President were presented with H.J. Res. 109, he would veto it.” 
H.J. Resolution 109 is a bipartisan resolution proposed in February and sponsored by Nebraska Representative Mike Flood.

Bitcoin Short-Term Jitters: Are Whales Losing Interest? - DailyCoin


        
Bitcoin’s price has been stuck for weeks, but is this a buying opportunity or a sign of an impending crash?



Analysts have been puzzled by recent whale activity, a major factor in Bitcoin’s price movements.



While some data suggests whales have lost interest, a recent buying spree hints at a possible reversal.
Bitcoin’s price has been hovering between $60,000 and $64,000 for weeks, presenting a buying opportunity for investors eyeing a peak in the current bull cycle. However, recent on-chain data paints a conflicting picture of whale activity, a major factor influencing Bitcoin’s price movements.Whales’ Enthusiasm WanesLarge investors, or “whales,” holding over 1,000 BTC significantly bolstered Bitcoin’s price through consistent buying, particularly during market dips, throughout the beginning of 2024. This activity fueled bullish sentiment and prevented major price corrections. 
However, data from IntoTheBlock, an on-chain analytics firm, reveals a concerning trend: the volume of Bitcoin accumulated by whales has shrunk with each buying cycle over the past month.The most significant buying spree occurred between March 5 and 7, with whales acquiring over 120,000 BTC. Every subsequent price dip witnessed a decrease in whale accumulation, with the recent drop to $56,000 failing to attract a notable buying response. This decline suggests that whales might have lost some short-term interest in accumulating more Bitcoin.Recent Uptick Suggests Re-Accumulation PhaseHowever, a recent post from blockchain analytics platform Santiment indicates a potential shift. According to Santiment, large investors holding between 1,000 and 10,000 BTC collectively purchased over $941 million worth of Bitcoin in the past 24 hours. This resurgence in buying activity signifies a potential re-accumulation phase for whales following a period of profit-taking.
This conflicting on-chain data has divided crypto experts. Some analysts, like Willy Woo, believe investors are accumulating Bitcoin again, but a confirmation of the trend reversal might take a week. Others, like Ki Young Ju, CEO of CryptoQuant, view the recent whale activity as the beginning of a new bullish era.On the other hand, some analysts at Bitfinex crypto exchange believe selling pressure might be waning, potentially leading to a price recovery. This aligns with the increased positive inflows observed in the United States spot Bitcoin exchange-traded fund market in the past week.Concerns Linger About Waning Whale ConvictionDespite the recent uptick, the initial decline in whale buying activity raises concerns about a potential reversal into a bearish trend. Some analysts even speculate that Bitcoin might have peaked in this cycle. While lower whale buying activity could stall price increases in the short term, it doesn’t necessarily guarantee a major crash. However, continuing this trend for several months could signal weakening market demand. While a drop below the current support level of $59,000-$61,000 could cause losses for many holders, most crypto analysts remain optimistic about Bitcoin’s long-term prospects. The coming weeks will be crucial in determining the short-term trajectory of Bitcoin’s price. Whether the recent whale buying signals a renewed accumulation phase or a short-term blip remains to be seen.On the Flipside
Short-term profit-taking by whales could be a buying opportunity for smaller investors seeking to accumulate at lower prices.



The declining whale buying activity could be due to investors waiting for a deeper price correction before accumulating more Bitcoin.



The positive inflows into the US spot Bitcoin ETF market could indicate renewed institutional interest in Bitcoin, which could help offset any potential selling pressure from whales.
Why This MattersWhales have been a key driver of Bitcoin’s price surge in 2024. Recent data showing a decline in their buying activity, followed by a small uptick, creates uncertainty. This conflicting picture raises concerns about waning whale confidence, potentially impacting Bitcoin’s price trajectory in the coming weeks and influencing broader market sentiment.If you’re interested in learning more about the technical indicators used to forecast Bitcoin’s price, this is the article for you:Bitcoin Sees Choppy Waters Ahead: Are Bulls Out of the Race?Are you curious about what analysts think caused the recent upswing and where Bitcoin is headed next?

Bitcoin Wallet Maker Exodus 'Deeply Disappointed' as SEC Blocks NYSE Listing - Decrypt

Bitcoin wallet software company Exodus Movement has said it was “surprised, confused, and deeply disappointed” after the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) move to delay the company’s planned listing on a U.S. stock exchange. Yesterday, the SEC postponed the crypto company’s listing on the NYSE American, the New York Stock Exchange’s sibling market, according to Exodus. “Today, the SEC made a surprise last-minute decision that delays Exodus from listing on the NYSE American,” Exodus said on Twitter (aka X) late Wednesday. “While we are deeply disappointed, Exodus will continue to empower customers all over the world to control their own wealth using our best-in-class self-custody crypto wallet,” the firm’s statement reads.In an official statement, Exodus CEO JP Richardson said: “While we are surprised and confused by this last-minute decision, we remain hopeful that the SEC will follow through on its commitment to treat us as the law intends.”Exodus, which offers a self-custodial software wallet for a number of cryptocurrencies, declined to comment further and respond to Decrypt’s questions. The company, which went public in 2021, was due to list its common stock on NYSE American under the ticker EXOD. Exodus’ common stock was set to be tokenized on Algorand, the crypto network behind ALGO, the 64th biggest digital asset. That would make it the only company in the U.S. to have its common stock tokenized on a blockchain. Wall Street’s top regulator, the SEC, has come down hard on the digital asset industry over the past few years. It has sued a number of top American crypto exchanges—including Coinbase and Kraken—for allegedly offering unregistered securities, and has further warned other crypto startups that enforcement actions are coming.Edited by Andrew HaywardStay on top of crypto news, get daily updates in your inbox.

JUST IN: Popular Altcoin Network Stops Again - Users Cannot See Their Funds - Are Funds Safe? Developers Released a Statement - Bitcoin Sistemi


Zilliqa (ZIL), which had a serious problem in block production yesterday afternoon, stopped again minutes ago after it was announced that the problem was solved today.
Currently, Zilliqa mainnet is still unable to produce blocks.


In their announcement, the developers said that they had information that block production had stopped. In addition, they explained that it was not fully understood what the problem was that was solved yesterday, but after today's outage, they started to understand exactly what caused the problem.
Developers said they are currently trying to get to the root of the problem and get the network ready to operate at full capacity again.






In addition, addressing the issue that many users cannot see ZIL tokens in their wallets, the developers stated that the funds are safe. They shared that users who cannot see their funds in the wallet application can use the Zilliqa block explorer, write their addresses and check their assets.
The price of the altcoin, which is also listed on Binance and Upbit, does not seem to be affected much by the outage. According to data, ZIL increased by 0.71% in the last 24 hours. At the time of writing this article, the market value of the altcoin is around 416 million dollars.

Address poisoning attacker sends $153K ETH to victim and agrees to negotiate

The address-poisoning attacker who allegedly tricked a user into sending them $68 million worth of Wrapped Bitcoin (WBTC) has sent $153,000 worth of Ether (ETH) back to the victim in an apparent show of good faith. In the same transaction, the attacker sent a message agreeing to negotiate and asking the victim for a Telegram username where they can be contacted. The amount sent back represents just 0.225% of the total funds allegedly stolen.Blockchain data shows that on May 5, the attack victim, whose account ends in 8fD5, sent three messages to an account ending in dA6D. The recipient of the message had received funds from the attacking account, labeled “FakePhishing327990” on Etherscan, through several intermediate accounts. This implies that dA6D was likely to have been controlled by the attacker. The messages implied that the victim was willing to give the attacker 10% of the funds as a bounty and refrain from prosecuting if they returned the other 90%. The victim stated:“We both know there's no way to clean this funds. You will be traced. We also both understand the ‘sleep well’ phrase wasn't about your moral and ethical qualities. Nevertheless, we officially admin your right to the 10%. Send 90% back. There are 24 hours for you before 10am UTC, 6th May 2024 to make a decision that will change your life, in any case.”At 11:37 am UTC on May 9, another account ending in 72F1 responded by sending 51 Ether (ETH) (worth $153,000 at today’s price) to the victim. 72F1 had also received funds from FakePhishing327990 through several intermediate accounts, indicating it was also under the attacker's control. In the transaction that sent the 51 ETH, the attacker also posted a message stating “PleaseleaveyourtelegramandIwillcontactyou.” They then attempted to correct their bad punctuation at 11:43 am, posting an additional message that stated: “Please leave your telegram and I will contact you[.]”In response, the victim posted a Telegram username where they can be contacted.Address poisoning victim negotiates with attacker. Source: Etherscan.The negotiation occurred after the attacker allegedly tricked the victim into sending 1,155 Wrapped Bitcoin (WBTC) (worth $68 million at the time) into their account by mistake, which they did through an “address poisoning” transaction.Blockchain data shows that at 09:17 am on May 3, the attacker used a smart contract to transfer 0.05 of a token from the victim’s account to the attacker's account. The token transferred had no name listed on Etherscan and was simply referred to as “ERC-20.” Under normal circumstances, an attacker cannot transfer a token from another user without their consent. But in this case, the token had a custom design that allowed it to be transferred from an account without the user’s consent.At 10:31 am on the same day, the victim sent 1,155 WBTC to this address, apparently by mistake. The address may have appeared similar to an address used by the victim to deposit funds into a centralized exchange or for some other reason.In addition, the victim may have seen that they sent 0.05 of a token to this address in the past and therefore assumed it was safe. However, the 0.05 tokens were sent by the attacker and only appeared to have come from the victim. When an attacker attempts to confuse victims by spamming them with transactions that appear to be coming from them but are actually coming from the attacker, security experts call it an “address poisoning attack.” Experts recommend that users carefully inspect the sending address in a transaction before confirming it, so as to avoid costly errors from these kinds of attacks.Related: How to avoid zero-value transfer address poisoning attacks

Will Dogecoin (DOGE) Price Be Able to Reinitiate Recovery?


Dogecoin (DOGE) is sitting in a crucial position, and losing it could cause considerable losses to investors. 
The broader market is becoming increasingly bearish, so DOGE may find it hard to prevent a drawdown.
Dogecoin Investors May Witness Losses
At the time of writing, Dogecoin’s price is trading above a crucial support loss, which could result in a potential death cross. The crypto market is cooling down from the recent rally, and this impact can be seen across digital assets.
The Moving Average Convergence Divergence hints at the same. (MACD) is a trend-following momentum indicator that identifies trend changes by comparing two moving averages of an asset’s price. 

The indicator observes the formation of a potential bearish crossover with the green bars on the histogram declining. This suggests that bullishness is receding even though the past week was the first instance of optimism in the past month.
Dogecoin MACD. Source: TradingView
Generally, when the market does not support a recovery, investors tend to be the saviors of an asset. However, this is not the case with DOGE since investors will likely opt to step back.
This is because, as noted on the Global In/Out of the Money (GIOM) indicator, about 12.48 billion DOGE bought between $0.13 and $0.15 will lose profitability if Dogecoin’s price falls. This $1.8 billion worth of supply becoming turn loss-bearing will potentially incentivize investors to HODL until gains are visible.

Thus, this would affect their participation, which in turn will slow down any chances of recovery Dogecoin may have.
DOGE Price Prediction: The Last Ray of Support
Trading at $0.14, Dogecoin’s price is sitting above a key support level, which has been tested multiple times in the past. Falling through this crucial support in the past has resulted in a drawdown to the $0.12 support level.

The Exponential Moving Averages (EMA) are forming a potential death cross. A death cross is a bearish technical pattern where a short-term 50-day EMA crosses below a long-term 200-day EMA. This indicates a potential downtrend continuation.

Consequently, DOGE could fall to $0.12 support and, in the process, result in $1.8 billion worth of losses as well.
However, if Dogecoin’s price returns from the $0.14 support, it could note a recovery beyond $0.15. This would invalidate the bearish thesis and make the 12.48 billion DOGE profitable again.

How Ethereum EIP-7702 Boosts Wallet UX with Minimal Downsides - DailyCoin


        
Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin has launched a proposal to improve the wallet experience of crypto users.



The new proposal, dubbed EIP-7702, rivals EIP-3074, which has come into focus recently.



The recent proposal has sparked a debate over which should be included in Ethereum’s next upgrade.
Ethereum is hunting for a halfway solution to improve the user experience of traditional wallets.Until recently, EIP-3074 was the major contender to fill the gap, and it had already been earmarked for the network’s next upgrade, known as Pectra. But just as users were digesting the implications of EIP-3074, a competing proposal from Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin arrived on the scene: EIP-7702.
How do the rival EIPs compare?A Less Disruptive and More Future-Proof Change?First proposed in 2020, EIP-3074 intends to allow users of traditional wallets to enjoy the same benefits as smart wallets created in 2023 by EIP-4337. These benefits include the ability to batch transactions, sponsor transactions of one wallet, and recover wallet addresses with social recovery tools. The proposal makes code changes to the EVM, allowing users to delegate wallet control to smart contracts called invokers.Despite the potential benefits, EIP-3074 raises security and forward compatibility concerns. The security concerns come from market participants fearing that many users could lose their assets by delegating to malicious invokers. To address this, however, wallets will likely create a trusted list of invokers from which to choose. On the other hand, addressing forward compatibility concerns has yet to be as straightforward. With the network eventually intending to fully transition to smart wallets under EIP-4337, building with EIP-3074 could lead to interoperability issues in the future. Enter EIP-7702.
Proposed on Tuesday, May 7, by Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin and co-authors Sam Wilson, Ansgar Dietrichs, and Matt Garnett, EIP-7702 intends to realize all the benefits of EIP-3074 without the forward compatibility concerns. Instead of making code changes to the EVM, EIP-7702 defines a new transaction type that allows users to temporarily populate the existing “contract_code” field in traditional wallets with smart contract code for a given transaction, effectively converting the wallet to a smart contract wallet for the duration of the transaction. Explaining how EIP-7702 addresses the issue of compatibility with EIP-4337 in a HackMD post on Tuesday, Buterin wrote:"The contract code that users would need to sign could literally be existing ERC-4337 wallet code."With EIP-7702 offering a less disruptive and more forward-proof change, it has already begun to garner significant support within the Ethereum community.EIP-7702 To Make It to Pectra?Highlighting the level of support being seen by EIP-7702, Safe co-founder Lukas Schor asserted that it was even receiving support from proponents of EIP-3074.At the same time, some community members have begun advocating for the inclusion of EIP-7702 over EIP-3074 in Pectra. Whether the EIP will be included in the proposal could be determined in the All Core Developers Execution (ACDE) meeting scheduled for Thursday, May 9.On the Flipside 
EIP-7702 is still in the draft stage, meaning its authors can freely edit it.
Why This Matters As the crypto space matures and looks to go mainstream, a key hurdle has been how to abstract away the complexities of the technology. For users of the Ethereum network, this discussion has often settled around how users store their crypto assets and perform transactions, leading to the rise of a concept called account abstraction. EIP-7702 promises to give users of traditional Ethereum wallets the benefits of smart contract wallets while not compromising the network’s account abstraction roadmap.Read these for more on Ethereum:Ethereum’s Next Upgrade Will Boost Wallet UX, but at What Cost?Ethereum Network Growth Spikes Again in Bullish Sign for Price

Majority of Swing State Voters Feel Financial System ‘Favors Elites Over Regular People’: DCG Survey - The Daily Hodl


								Most voters in US swing states think that the financial system is not fair, according to a new survey commissioned by venture capital firm Digital Currency Group (DCG).
The Harris Poll surveyed 1,201 registered voters in Michigan, Ohio, Montana, Pennsylvania, Nevada and Arizona to explore the attitude of the electorate towards crypto and the current financial system.










The survey found that voters in key battleground states are skeptical of the current financial system. Only 38% percent of the respondents think that the current financial system is meant for people like them while 25% see the system as fair for all.
Reads the report,
“The current financial system is broadly unpopular, with widespread voter agreement that that system is inequitable and that younger generations in particular, are disadvantaged.”
Four in every five registered voters also think that the current financial system favors the elites over regular people.
“The current financial system garners negative reactions from voters, with the majority agreeing that the system favors elites over regular people (80%), lacks transparency (79%), is difficult to understand (67%), and that younger generations are set up to fail (63%).”
Only 14% of the voters own digital assets and 69% do not feel knowledgeable about crypto, but nearly a third have positive feelings towards crypto, of which around 90% are planning to vote in the upcoming 2024 elections.
“Nearly half of voters do not trust political candidates that would interfere with crypto. One-quarter say that enthusiasm towards crypto would make them trust a political candidate more. 30% would be more likely to support a political candidate that is friendly to crypto.”

$1.35B in Bitcoin options expire this week - Do BTC bulls or bears have the upper hand?

Whenever Bitcoin's (BTC) price action exhibits significant corrections, analysts and traders are quick to search for a reason, often pointing fingers at derivatives markets where bears allegedly exploit futures contract liquidation levels or anticipate increased profits from weekly BTC options expiries. Such talk has been on the decline recently, thanks to Bitcoin’s range-bound price action, but now that murmurs of a trend reversal have come back, let’s take a look at how whales are positioned using Bitcoin derivatives markets.Will the May 10$1.35 billion BTC options expiry bring volatility?The recent failure to maintain prices above $65,000 on May 6 is an example of how some market participants blame the weekly options expiry for the recent downtrend. If this were the case, which can be inferred by BTC derivatives metrics, further downward pressure could be expected ahead of the 8:00 am UTC expiry on May 10.From a top-down perspective, the $1.35 billion options open interest seems substantial enough to justify the effort from Bitcoin bears. However, a more detailed analysis reveals a different scenario. Deribit holds an 84% market share for the May 10 options expiry, so data will primarily be extracted from that exchange. Since the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME) only offers monthly contracts, it was excluded from the analysis.It's worth noting that call (buy) and put (sell) options are not always matched when stacked against each other, a common feature for such instruments regardless of the underlying asset. Thus, the first relationship to consider is the volume discrepancy between these instruments. Generally, increased demand for puts indicates bearish markets.Deribit BTC options put-to-call volume. Source: Laevitas.chNote that the average BTC options put-to-call volume at Deribit stood at 0.60 for the past 10 days, meaning put (sell) instruments had 40% lower volumes compared to call (buy) options, which has been the norm for the past month. In essence, it's difficult to justify that bears have set some kind of trap or anticipated Bitcoin's failure to sustain $65,000 on May 6.Bitcoin bulls cast overly optimistic betsHowever, one should not take every call option buyer at face value, especially given that there are less than 13 hours ahead of the actual expiry on May 10. For instance, there is hardly a way to justify a right to buy Bitcoin at $74,000 or even $90,000 in such a short time. Therefore, one should not account for those overly optimistic bets when measuring the open interest.Open interest for May 10 Bitcoin expiry at Deribit, in BTC terms. Source: DeribitEven though the put-to-call ratio shows a 35% lower demand for put options, bears are at less risk, as most of the call instruments were placed at $63,000 and higher. In fact, the open interest for call options below this level is $91 million, which means 87% of them will be worthless on May 10. However, if Bitcoin bulls manage to reestablish the $64,000 support, the open interest for call options will surpass the put instruments by $115 million.Related: Despite Bitcoin price volatility, factors point to BTC’s long-term successWhile bears may have avoided significant losses had Bitcoin stayed above $65,000, this doesn't necessarily mean they will come out ahead in the end. Put options at $61,500 or higher have a total open interest of $104 million, which is just enough to balance the equation. The best-case scenario for bears requires a Bitcoin price below $61,000 to secure a $100 million advantage.There is no indication that Bitcoin bears placed additional bets using BTC options to profit from a price crash ahead of the May 10 expiry. There was no unusual demand between put and call instruments, and there is no specific price level that greatly benefits bears. Whatever strategies were employed, the result is an apparent balanced impact at $62,000, suggesting no price surprises are expected.This article does not contain investment advice or recommendations.

How the latest TradFi blockchain trial could mark the ‘five-yard-line’ for mass adoption - Blockworks


The TradFi world has been exploring more ways to use blockchain tech for years now.
But the sheer number of financial players involved in the latest proof-of-concept makes it different from most. Not to mention the size of the entities, and their approach.
Payment giants Visa and Mastercard are coming together with banks JPMorgan, Citigroup and others to test a so-called Regulated Settlement Network. 
The proof-of-concept sets out to experiment with shared ledger technology to settle tokenized commercial bank money, wholesale central bank money, US Treasury securities and other tokenized assets, a Wednesday news release notes.
Read more: Digital Asset Summit Day 2: Financial giants say they’re here to stay
This project represents a new phase of the Regulated Liability Network. Launched in November 2022, the initiative set out to demonstrate the use of shared ledger technology for regulated money movement on one platform.
The Securities Industry and Financial Markets Association (SIFMA) is set to manage the new proof of concept. Others involved include Swift, TD Bank, US Bank, USDF, Wells Fargo and Zions Bancorp.
Lamine Brahimi, co-founder of crypto platform Taurus, said he welcomes any initiative that puts cash on-chain at scale. 
“The real benefits of tokenization will come when both the securities and the cash legs of a transaction are both on-chain,” he told Blockworks.
An evolution of projects
Financial players have long explored how it could unlock greater automation and more standardized data rails via blockchain tech while cutting costs and offering greater transparency.
Blockchain-focused proof-of-concepts and other tokenization efforts have seemed to ramp up in recent months. 
JPMorgan’s blockchain arm Onyx last year carried out tests under the Monetary Authority of Singapore’s Project Guardian to explore how fund managers could tokenize portfolios on various blockchains in a permissioned manner.
BlackRock used JPMorgan’s Tokenized Collateral Network to tokenize shares in one of its money market funds around the same time. It then sent those tokenized interests to Barclays as collateral for an over-the-counter derivatives trade.
Also under Project Guardian, Switzerland-based UBS brought a tokenized investment fund on Ethereum in November.
Even more recently, Citi tokenized a private equity fund issued by Wellington Management on Avalanche’s Spruce subnet in February.

But the latest efforts revealed on Wednesday appear “incrementally more important” than prior trials, said Colin Butler, global head of institutional capital at Polygon.
“I say that because the parties mentioned are looking to align on a standard, to which they’re getting closer,” he told Blockworks. “This represents to me the five-yard-line for mass institutional adoption.”
The financial industry’s approach to more recent blockchain projects is “qualitatively different” than in the past several years, said Ralf Kubli, board member of The Casper Association.
“It is clear that large institutions have decided that shared ledger technology offers a compelling value proposition in many critical areas of the value chain, and that they must be part of this development,” he explained. 
Institutional involvement in this space has come through experimentation, or by investing in or acquiring startups with mature technology stacks, Kubli noted.
The Depository Trust and Clearing Corporation (DTCC) closed its deal in December to acquire Securrency — a blockchain-based financial and regulatory technology developer. 
The world’s largest asset manager last week led a $47 million funding round for Securitize, a firm focused on bringing physical and traditional financial assets on-chain.

“This strong commitment by established financial institutions will drive the emergence of enterprise grade infrastructure by startups and spinouts, as well as provide a glimpse on the future interaction between public chains and permissioned environments,” Kubli told Blockworks.  
Proof-of-concept expectations
The proof-of-concept will publish an analysis of whether the network could operate under existing laws or guidance in the United States. Findings intend to inform “next generation settlement models,” SIFMA said in a news release.
Brahimi said he hopes to see “the confirmation of major efficiency gains” by having both securities and cash on-chain. The experiment could also demonstrate reduced counterparty risk and improved collateral transfers between institutions.
“A legal assessment of what needs to be modified to scale these activities will also be useful,” he added. “Based on the projects Taurus is involved in, it will be faster than what people think.”

Morgan Krupetsky, who leads business development for institutions and capital markets at Ava Labs, said she is encouraged by the array of entities involved. 
Still, more buy-side participation from asset managers, corporates, hedge funds and pension funds, for example, in such blockchain trials would be beneficial. Having that segment’s buy-in and support will be critical, she added.
“They often experience comparable pain points, [and] they’re increasingly viewing this space as a strategic imperative,” she told Blockworks. “[It] would provide valuable input and insight to the banks who ultimately service these, and other, clients.”
Those anxiously awaiting an overhaul of legacy financial services infrastructure and systems will have to stay patient. 
The lengthy experimentation ultimately helps financial institutions, infrastructure providers and regulators assess the benefits of dedicating resources to ultimately building products that use shared ledger tech, Krupetsky explained.  
Kubli added: “I believe we will see serious and productive environments in the coming six to 12 months as part of the various peer-to-peer engagement…and more importantly, through the various sandbox approaches and central bank-led initiatives, including the [Bank for International Settlements].”

With Bitcoin at a ‘Range Low’, Crypto Analyst Picks Out Two ‘Promising’ Altcoins for Traders To Watch - The Daily Hodl


								One widely followed crypto analyst says Bitcoin (BTC) needs to hold current price levels or face a precipitous drop.
Crypto trader Michaël van de Poppe tells his 717,100 followers on the social media platform X that BTC could potentially fall by $10,000 in value if current levels aren’t maintained.










“Bitcoin is at the range low. This is technically the area where you’d prefer to see it hold, so the upward momentum continues, and the range holds.
If this doesn’t hold, then we might expect $52,000-$55,000 as a potential low on this correction.”
Source: Michaël van de Poppe/X
BTC is trading for $61,966 at time of writing, up 5% on the week.
The analyst next breaks down AIOZ Network (AIOZ), a blockchain project seeking to embed itself at the intersection of Web3, AI, storage and streaming.
“This one looks very promising and is one of the strongest trending assets.
In-trend level to hold: $0.65-0.68.
If that’s lost, then the long-term investment region comes into play.
If we hold, I expect $1.35-1.45 might seem next. 
Very strong one.”
Source: Michaël van de Poppe/X
AIOZ is trading for $0.853 at time of writing, up 10% on the day.
Van de Poppe also looks at the decentralized finance (DeFi) protocol Injective (INJ). Even though INJ has been down big since December, Van de Poppe says the altcoin has a lot of room to run.
“The hype has faded away, and it’s down 70% against Bitcoin.
A prime example of rotation.
Peaked in December ’23. 
Bitcoin did a +70% since then, INJ a -40%. 
Never marry your bag; rotate to Bitcoin to make more Bitcoin. 
An attractive area for a long.”
Source: Michaël van de Poppe/X
INJ is worth $23.69 at time of writing.

Giant Whale May Have Sold a Large Amount of the Most Talked About Altcoin of Recent Weeks - Bitcoin Sistemi


According to Onchain data, a large cryptocurrency whale may have recently sold heavily in an altcoin listed on Binance.
Data shows that an account with short wallet address 0x58FD transferred 14.53 million Ethena (ENA) to Bybit minutes ago. The amount in question corresponds to 12.54 million dollars at the time of writing this article.


Balina wallet purchased this amount of ENA tokens from the developer company Ethena Labs on April 1.
Although the whale wallet's transfer of tokens to a central cryptocurrency exchange most likely means sale, it is not possible to determine exactly whether the whale actually sold these tokens.






ENA, one of Binance's Launchpool projects, was recently launched and made a big splash. Ethena has a stablecoin called USDe and is compared to Terra, the $40 billion cryptocurrency ecosystem that went bankrupt due to the high interest income it promised. However, the developers claim that they have no connection with Terra's system.
At the time of writing this article, ENA price has lost 3.78% of its value in the last 24 hours and is traded at $0.87.

SEC has taken ‘too expansive’ a view of crypto, says former commissioner

Troy Paredes, who served as a commissioner at the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) from 2008 to 2013, suggested that the regulator might be overreaching on what digital assets it considered securities.Speaking at the TokenizeThis 2024 conference in Miami on May 9, Paredes said SEC Chair Gary Gensler seemed to suggest that the commission had clarity on his views of what constituted a security under the Howey test. However, he said there was still a “jurisdictional question” the SEC needed to address on digital assets.“I mean, if it’s not a security, then it’s outside the scope of the federal securities laws in the SEC’s jurisdiction,” said Paredes. “The commission, I believe, has taken a very expansive view as to what constitutes a security under the Howey test.”Troy Paredes speaking at TokenizeThis 2024. Source: Sam BourgiThe former commissioner added that many in and outside of the SEC seemed to be focusing on labeling certain tokens as securities, but they weren’t addressing how to “adapt the regulatory regime” for digital assets. He added there was “a lot of uncertainty” among firms attempting to comply with regulatory requirements.Related: SEC doesn’t want Ethereum to transform banking landscape, says Joseph LubinMany have criticized the SEC for taking a “regulation by enforcement” approach to crypto firms offering tokens or crypto services to U.S. residents. The commission filed lawsuits against Binance, Kraken and Ripple and may be preparing for an enforcement action against Robinhood after it issued a Wells notice.The SEC’s actions have prompted a response from many lawmakers looking to restrict the commission’s authority over digital assets. On May 8, a majority in the U.S. House of Representatives voted for a resolution overturning an SEC Staff Accounting Bulletin on banks custodying customers’ digital assets. President Joe Biden said he plans to veto the bill.Magazine: Crypto regulation: Does SEC Chair Gary Gensler have the final say?

                        An NFT trader lost over $145,000 worth of tokens in a BAYC phishing scam, according to May 9 data from on-chain security platform PeckShield.PeckShield revealed that a trader known as “tatis.eth” fell victim to a phishing scam perpetrated by an attacker identified as “PinkDrainer.” The malicious entity stole three valuable BAYC NFTs – BAYC 7531, BAYC 6736, and BAYC 2100 – from the trader’s wallet.
The BAYC Phishing Scam That Led to the Loss of $145,000 Worth of NFTs
BAYC, also known as Bored Ape Yacht Club (BAYC), is a collection of 100,000 Ethereum-based collectibles. These NFTs are among the most influential and expensive ones around. They feature profile pictures of bored cartoon apes in various facial expressions and clothing.A similar report from ZachXBT revealed that the stolen NFTs were transferred to a phishing address labeled “Fake_Phishing328357” on May 8 at 5:47 PM UTC. Thereafter, the attacker sold the three NFTs for a total of 48.5 ETH, equivalent to approximately $145,000.Source: Blockchain Data/ZachXBTThis is not the first time the “PinkDrainer” scammer has been involved in such atrocious activities. Cyvers Alerts, a real-time security alert platform, recently reported a similar phishing scheme where a victim’s wallet was drained of $92,800 worth of Ethereum to the same “PinkDrainer” address.In December 2023, the same hacker group reportedly stole Chainlink (LINK) tokens worth $4.4 million by tricking users into authorizing transactions linked to the “IncreaseAllowance” function.In Q4 of 2023, recurrent incidents of scammers impersonating reputable platforms and protocols to obtain transaction approvals and steal digital assets from unsuspecting users were widely reported.A notable instance was the JPEG’d NFT protocol, where the community had to come out in October 2023 about multiple fraudulent platforms imitating its offerings in an attempt to obtain transaction approvals so they could scam users of their NFTs and digital assets.
Over $104 million Has Been Lost to Crypto Phishing And NFT Scams in 2024
The crypto industry has been on the receiving end of enormous losses due to phishing attacks in the first two months of 2024.According to Scam Sniffer data, an estimated 97,000 users have fallen victim to these sophisticated scams, resulting in a total loss of $104 million worth of cryptocurrencies. This was followed by its report that showed $46.86 million worth of crypto was stolen in February 2024.The Ethereum ecosystem has been specifically targeted, with $78 million of the total losses coming from users’ Ether and ERC20 tokens being drained from their wallets.Most of these funds were lost due to unsuspecting users signing malicious signatures, such as “ERC20 Permit” and “increaseAllowance,” which grant attackers unauthorized access to their assets.Crypto News also reported in April 2024 that phishing campaigns were targeting users of Etherscan, with several advertisements being used for malicious operations.
Scam Sniffer’s analysis revealed that cybercriminals have been leveraging social media platforms, particularly X (formerly Twitter), to lure unsuspecting victims to phishing sites.These hackers post deceptive comments under the X posts of targeted accounts in a way that impersonates their customer representatives and directs users to malicious websites where their assets are compromised.While the losses in the first two months of 2024 are concerning, they represent only a fraction of the $300 million in total funds lost by users to crypto phishing attacks throughout 2023.

Trump's Crypto Embrace | Bankless


Trump Pump. Crypto had a mainstream moment last night at 2024 US Presidential candidate Donald Trump’s NFT trading card gala. Could a Trump re-election be bullish for the crypto industry, and what tokens managed to pop off?Collectors of Trump’s NFT trading cards got access to an exclusive Q&A with the former President at his Mar-a-Lago Palm Beach golf estate, and many of his responses at the event quickly found their way into virality on Crypto Twitter.In one clip, Trump states he does not want to see crypto companies forced to leave America because of hostile regulation.In another, he berates Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) Chair Gary Gensler and the broader Democratic party for their anti-crypto attitudes, juxtaposing himself as the candidate who is “fine with it” and the only choice for pro-crypto voters come the general election this November.Trump's message resonated strongly with an overwhelming majority of CT, leading many thought leaders to throw their weight behind the controversial Presidential hopeful in an election that has increasingly become a single-issue contest for many industry participants.
While there is certainly a possibility that Trump was simply pandering to his pro-crypto audience given the nature of the event, President Biden's administration has clearly demonstrated that it will do everything possible to stall and hinder the growth of crypto.From executive branch agencies that have done little besides suing leading crypto companies for breach of unclear regulations while failing to provide clarity to President Biden’s commitment to veto a recent House bill seeking to eliminate onerous capital requirements imposed by the SEC on banks that custody crypto assets, the evidence overwhelmingly indicates that the current administration is committed to maintaining a hostile stance toward crypto.
A Trump re-election would be monumental for the industry, considering that his statements – alongside his NFT collection – suggest his administration would adopt a much more pro-crypto approach to regulation than its predecessor, potentially providing the needed regulatory clarity to fuel widespread adoption.Additionally, while the proposed Biden Budget for 2025 would send the highest capital gains tax bracket to its highest level since 1922 and includes a novel 25% on unrealized gains, Trump has vowed to make expiring provisions from his 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act permanent upon re-election.Extension of these tax cuts would not only increase the amount of capital retained by investors, it is also anticipated to increase the US fiscal deficit by $3.8T over the next decade. The former factor would fuel investment by crypto insiders and the latter would bolster the attractiveness of decentralized monetary systems to the masses.PolitiFi tokens have yet again emerged as one of the preeminent avenues to gamble on the outcome of the upcoming election and express support for the candidates.Given the Donald’s strong alignment with the crypto industry, the majority of degens were aping Trump-associated memecoins, sending the derpy TREMP memecoin on Solana skyrocketing over 200% and the more vulnerable Ethereum-native TRUMP surging 80% at their peaks.While the impact was substantially more muted for the premier Joe Biden memecoin, BODEN, the token also experienced a minor pump, gaining as much as 40% after Trump responded to a fan’s question about the coin at his gala.Unfortunately for BODEN apes, and potentially PolitiFi token holders at large, Trump indicated in his response that the token was overvalued.

Binance Whistleblower Alleges Profit Before User Protection - DailyCoin


        
New allegations emerge over Binance prioritizing profit over users.



A high-rolling VIP client is at the center of the storm.



The whistleblower claimed Binance management turned a blind eye to fraud.   
Following last year’s bombshell charges and fines from US authorities over money laundering and sanctions violations, Binance was keen to move on and put the past behind them. While many observers thought Binance was the victim of an overzealous regulators’ crackdown, emerging allegations from a former senior employee at the company are punching holes in that narrative.Binance Under FireEmerging allegations published by the Wall Street Journal (WSJ) alleged that systemic fraud took place at Binance, based on the testimony of a former senior employee in the exchange’s market surveillance unit. The whistleblower, who was subsequently fired, claimed management turned a blind eye to manipulation and fraud by VIP clients.
DWF Labs, a crypto market maker and investment firm headed by Russian national Andrei Grachev, is the client at the center of the allegations. At Binance, traders with over $4 billion in monthly volume qualify for VIP status, unlocking discounted fees and access to dedicated account managers.According to the fired investigator, DWF Labs allegedly used the Binance platform to artificially inflate trading volumes, manipulate token prices, and generate hundreds of millions in illegitimate profits through wash trading.Market ManipulationThe alleged manipulative practices occurred with at least seven crypto tokens traded on Binance, including Yield Guild Games (YGG). In February 2023, DWF Labs invested $13.8 million in YGG to acquire around 35% of its token treasury. 
Summer 2023 saw a 510% jump in YGG’s price over the week of August 7, 2023. The token subsequently crashed over 80% by August 17, 2023, fueling rumors of manipulation.YGGUSDT daily chart per Trading ViewBinance’s internal investigators uncovered evidence that DWF Labs had engaged in fraudulent trading related to YGG and other tokens, violating the exchange’s terms of service. The investigative team submitted a report recommending that DWF Labs be de-platformed due to their findings.However, the report allegedly faced fierce pushback from Binance’s department, which handled VIP accounts. This led to a separate internal probe into the investigators who raised red flags about the trading firm’s conduct in the first place.Management Turns Blind EyeThe second internal probe stated that there was insufficient evidence that DWF Labs had intentionally engaged in market manipulation and that identified instances of washing trading could be coincidental, which alone did not constitute fraudulent actions.The inquiry also raised concerns that the head investigator had collaborated too closely with a competing trading firm that originally flagged DWF to Binance. Ultimately, Binance’s leadership team rejected the recommendation to remove DWF Labs from the platform. Instead, the exchange fired the lead investigator who oversaw the DWF case. Several other investigators were subsequently let go, while others quit voluntarily.Binance denied participating in manipulative trading and said it continuously improves its compliance operations.Is Binance Dodgy?Although the allegations relate to events before the Department of Justice’s charges became public late last year, the whistleblower’s claims still lighten the narrative that Binance was a victim of regulatory hostility. Throughout Binance’s legal battle with US authorities, former CEO Changpeng Zhao (CZ) had insisted the exchange operated above board. In his resignation tweet, CZ defiantly declared that his plea deal meant US authorities “do not allege that Binance misappropriated any user funds, and do not allege that Binance engaged in any market manipulation.”On the Flipside
Binance agreed to a $4.3 billion settlement and to leave the US market following DoJ charges.



Current CEO Richard Teng stated that Binance‘s core values of protecting users and being a platform people love to use remain unchanged upon taking over from CZ.
Why This MattersThis case exposed crypto exchanges’ inherent conflicts between enforcing fair trading rules and maintaining lucrative relationships with high-volume traders. Crypto cryptics, such as SEC chair Gensler, will no doubt relish the whistleblower’s claims.Richard Teng calls for Nigerian authorities to release imprisoned Binance exec.Binance CEO Urges Nigeria to Release Tigran GambaryanPresidential hopeful Donald Trump sides with the US crypto industry.Trump Backs US Crypto Industry, Says “I’m Good With It”

Lucky Whale Spent $6,500 to Buy This Altcoin and Turned It Into $5.6 Million with 870x Profit - Bitcoin Sistemi


According to the incident noticed by the analysts of the cryptocurrency analysis company Lookonchain, a crypto wallet managed to turn an extremely low capital into a fortune with great luck.
Wallet address waxl.eth purchased $6,500 worth of TRUMP tokens and sold them for $5.6 million for an 870x profit.


According to Onchain data, the waxl.eth wallet purchased the 2.08 million TRUMP tokens by paying $6,500 with two different wallets. Then he sold TRUMP, worth $1.24 million, for $902,000. However, the lucky whale still has 832 thousand TRUMP in his wallet, and their value is around 4.7 million dollars at the time of writing.

To make the incident even more interesting, the same wallet in question managed to reach high amounts in the altcoin named BasedAI (BASEDAI) almost simultaneously, using a very small principal amount. According to the data, the wallet purchased 249 thousand BasedAI by spending 4 thousand dollars. Then he sold 19,500 of them for 137 thousand dollars. Currently, the whale has 238 thousand BASEDAIs and their value is around 1.1 million dollars.





However, it should not be forgotten that memecoins, especially those used by the whale, are extremely risky assets and many more users lose money in these coins than winning users.

Meme Coin Devs Are Doing Wild Things on Livestreams to Pump Tokens - Decrypt

Livestreaming your supposed mom shaking her breasts on camera to pump your meme coin is peak crypto degeneracy. But this sexually suggestive token, called LIVEMOM, is only the beginning of an increasingly weird—and rapidly expanding—wormhole of meme coin livestreams.Kidnapping, even more half-naked women, and fraudulent amputees are all part of this emerging livestream meta that has taken underground Solana degen traders by storm.At the same time that LiveMom was shaking her 36DDs next to her purported son, another livestream was underway. Aspiring political candidate Leland King Fawcette was attempting to create a meme coin called IMLIVEKICK, but the token fell from a $110,000 market cap to $10,000 in an hour—while the streamer raged in hilarious fashion, viewers say.It’s now effectively worthless. Since then, Fawcette has streamed five more times with countless more meme coins going to zero. The streamer claims that sniper bots are “rugging” his tokens, and so he’s now devised a plan to “rug” the sniper bots in return. But some people in his Discord believe that it’s been the streamer rugging this whole time.And so it goes amid this increasingly gonzo trend that's seeing some developers get creative as they attempt to stand out in a crowded meme coin market.Where did this come from?Every livestream meme coin that Decrypt has seen was launched using Pump.fun. This protocol allows anyone to create a Solana meme coin in minutes for only 0.02 SOL ($3). As a result of the barrier for entry being lower than ever, Solana has seen an explosion of new tokens.Notable meme coins like Michi, Shark Cat, and Mewing Coin were all launched using Pump.fun, along with countless thousands of others. In fact, the daily record for new Solana-based tokens minted was just broken on Tuesday, with 16,534 new tokens flooding the network in a single day. And Pump.fun is now one of the most profitable protocols across all of crypto.Pump.fun is even how the “first” live stream token was created, according to its devs. Richard Podgurski, co-founder of LiveTwitch, said he had an “extremely unhealthy obsession” with Pump.fun, as he watched random memes surge to million-dollar market caps. “Pump.fun, combined with freedom of speech and internet memes, has birthed 4Chan 2.0 on degenerate steroids,” Podgurski told Decrypt via email. “And I love every damn inch of it… the bad, the funny, the ugly. It's nothing short of the greatest corner of the internet at the moment.”Soon, he wanted in on the action and created LiveTwitch on March 26 with his partner Savanna—before setting off on a 52-hour livestream. The goal was to reinvent the social media revenue model, using the token as a subscriber model.While LiveMom promised to twerk if her coin hit a $750,000 market cap, the LiveTwitch couple have promised they’d get married if they hit $20 million. LiveTwitch’s more wholesome approach to a livestream token, however, didn’t appear to garner the same level of attention that LiveMom did.Degeneracy prevailsIn the days that followed LiveMom mania, the livestreaming meta spread—and the level of degeneracy only grew from there.A copycat project, LIVESIS, spawned with the goal of hitting a market cap of $100,000 for the streamer’s sister to take her bra off. Once the goal was reached, the purported sister revealed her chest—though many viewers believe it was a man—before the token plummeted to pretty much zero, allegedly due to a rug pull.We also saw a man called Roman get “kidnapped” by devs promising to release him at a $100,000 market cap. Amid a livestream showing Roman being poked with a stick while wearing a backpack over his head, the token quickly imploded.Only a couple days later, a man claimed that he had no hands and thus couldn’t possibly conduct a rug pull and drain all of the liquidity from the coin. Well, he lied. After only three minutes of livestreaming with a sign tucked under his chin, the man revealed his hidden arms, sprinted to his computer, and immediately sold his $1,000 worth of HANDS.This livestreaming meta shines a light on the troubling truth that, as humans, we’re attracted to the weird, insane, and downright wrong. Just like watching the latest serial killer documentary on Netflix or slowing down as you drive past a car crash, it’s hard to look away from the shock value of the ever-evolving nonsense that’s steadily popping up on Pump.fun and elsewhere in crypto.Normally, being rug-pulled is a thing of nightmares for investors. But the livestreaming meta is reinventing why investors are looking for low market cap gems.Did investors in LIVESIS believe it was going to be the next blue chip meme coin? Or did they just want to see the streamer strip and hope to avoid the dump in the process? Did Roman investors care about their own bag, or the bag over Roman’s head?With the crypto markets broadly cooling off in recent weeks, some crypto devs apparently can’t help but try shocking new tactics to gin up interest in their meme coins. And some investors, it seems, can’t help but look—and buy in, too.Edited by Andrew HaywardStay on top of crypto news, get daily updates in your inbox.

Bitcoin Exchange Inflows Hit Decade Low Amid Growing Institutional Interest



                    

Bitcoin exchange inflows have plummeted to levels last seen nearly a decade ago, according to recent data from the on-chain analytics platform CryptoQuant.



Daily BTC inflows have been decreasing significantly since the cryptocurrency’s peak price of $73,800.




As of April and May 2024, major cryptocurrency exchanges are recording some of the lowest daily inflows in ten years. 



On April 20, only 8,400 BTC entered exchanges, a number reminiscent of times when Bitcoin was priced under $1,000 per coin.



CryptoQuant monitors a substantial number of spot and derivative exchanges to gather these insights. 




This trend signifies a major shift in investor behavior, indicating a newfound reluctance to position Bitcoin for quick sales on exchanges.



Institutional interest in Bitcoin has been growing, suggesting the dawn of a new era in cryptocurrency investment. 



Despite the price’s recent volatility, including a drop to $56,500 last week, the desire to increase Bitcoin holdings remains strong, according to reports from Cointelegraph.

Market analysts continue to keep a close eye on Bitcoin whales—investors who hold large amounts of BTC. 



CryptoQuant contributor Mignolet noted that whales, particularly those holding between 1,000 to 10,000 BTC, have been largely inactive in terms of selling during the current market uptrend. 



“Whales may not be willing to sell yet as the cycle has not ended,” Mignolet explained, highlighting a potential increase in over-the-counter (OTC) market activities that could absorb significant sell volumes without requiring deposits into exchanges.



Checkmate, a pseudonymous lead on-chain analyst at Glassnode, expressed skepticism about the practice of “whale watching.” 



He suggested that many of the large wallets being tracked might be linked to entities like ETFs rather than individual high-stake investors. 



“There will be some actual whales yes…but as both buyers and sellers. Not once have I seen true alpha extracted from whale watching,” he stated on social media platform X.

Pump.Fun Surpasses Uniswap in Weekly Revenue - The Defiant

The memecoin launchpad raked in $3.3 million over the past seven days, putting it in second place behind Ethereum.Pump.Fun, a memecoin launchpad platform, has become the second-largest revenue-generating platform in DeFi over the last week, surpassed only by the Ethereum network.Top Projects By Weekly RevenueThe platform allows users to launch a token on Solana or Blast in minutes with no coding experience. During a Pump.Fun token’s initial launch phase, the token will trade along a bonding curve within the platform. Upon reaching a particular market capitalization, the bonding curve liquidity is transferred to Raydium, where the token commences trading on the open market.Pump.Fun Daily FeesDespite major memecoins such as $WIF and $PEPE trading lower over the past month, Pump.Fun activity has continued to trend higher. Over 450,000 unique tokens have been launched on the platform since March 1, with some tokens, such as $MICHI and $SC, eclipsing the $100m market cap level after launching at a market cap of $5,000.Pump.Fun’s ascent to one of the top earners in DeFi is indicative of the memecoin mania that has defined 2024.Its bonding curve mechanism acts as “un-ruggable liquidity” and allows users to speculate on microcap tokens without the worry of a malicious developer removing the liquidity on a traditional token launch. This significantly improves the user experience of high-risk, high-reward microcap trading.

Digital Currency Group revenue jumps 51% in 1Q24 despite GBTC outflows

Digital Currency Group (DCG) saw a surge in revenue in the first quarter of 2024, driven by the recovery of crypto markets. The crypto conglomerate’s revenue jumped 51% year-over-year to $229 million, the company reportedly wrote in a letter to shareholders.Grayscale’s revenue held steady during the quarter despite $17.4 billion in outflows from its Bitcoin fund since it was converted to an exchange-traded fund (ETF) in January. The asset manager generated $156 million in revenue thanks to rising asset prices, offsetting losses in assets under management.Grayscale’s outflows have arisen from the growing competition between Bitcoin ETF issuers offering lower management fees. The Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) charges 1.5% in management fees, while other funds, such as the Bitwise Bitcoin ETF (BITB), charge 0.2%. “While Grayscale expected outflows alongside increased competition under the ETF wrapper, Q1 revenue attributable to GBTC nevertheless exceeded our expectations,” Digital Currency Group said in the letter. Data from YCharts shows GBTC managed assets totaling over $18.1 billion as of May 9.GBTC Bitcoin holdings.

Crypto mining pool Foundry’s revenue jumped 35% to $51 million, boosted by staking services and equipment sales. Investing platform Luno saw its revenue soar by 46% to $16 million thanks to higher trading volumes. The conglomerate has been facing regulatory challenges in the United States. The New York Attorney General’s Office (NYAG) has recently expanded a fraud lawsuit against DCG, its CEO Barry Silbert, and Genesis Global Capital’s former CEO Soichiro Moro, to seek $3 billion in restitution. The NYAG accuses the companies of defrauding over 230,000 investors out of $1 billion through the Gemini Earn program. According to the initial complaint, the lawsuit seeks to ban Gemini, Genesis, and DCG from operating in New York, along with restitution for investment losses.Magazine: 1 in 6 new Base meme coins are scams, 91% have vulnerabilities

Ripple, XRPL Labs join Algorand Foundation as founding members of Decentralized Recovery Alliance - Crypto Briefing




Ripple and XRPL Labs have become founding members of the Decentralized Recovery (DeRec) Alliance, joining forces with Algorand Foundation and Swirlds Labs. As founding members, they will hold two-year seats on the Technical Oversight Committee, contributing to governance and policy development, said DeRec in today’s blog announcement.The HBAR Foundation, the Hashgraph Association, Acoer, BankSocial, Blade Labs, The Building Blocks, Casper Association, Constellation Network, and Revive Labs, have become DeRec’s Alliance Members. They will help create a new interoperability recovery standard to facilitate the recovery and adoption of digital assets, DeRec stated.Initially launched by Hedera and Algorand members, the DeRec Alliance’s mission is to simplify digital asset recovery, making it as user-friendly as Web2 experiences.Currently recovering crypto can be complicated. The Alliance wants to make it as simple as recovering an online account. This will be especially helpful for new users who might be discouraged by the complexity of Web3.The DeRec Alliance is developing an open-source protocol designed to help users recover lost digital assets such as secret keys, passwords, and seed phrases. By facilitating the recovery of secret keys, passwords, and seed phrases in a completely decentralized manner, the protocol ensures that personal data remains confidential and secure.The Alliance hopes that all blockchain companies will adopt this standard, making recovery easier across the entire crypto ecosystem.“The DeRec Alliance is a group of individuals and organizations committed to making the process of securing and recovering digital assets, accounts, passwords, and other secrets as simple as existing Web2 experiences,” said Dr. Leemon Baird, Hedera co-founder.Markus Infanger of RippleX expressed Ripple’s commitment to the Alliance’s goals. He also emphasized the importance of user-friendly private key management.“The DeRec Alliance addresses one of the biggest challenges facing mainstream crypto adoption—secure and user-friendly management of private keys,” Infanger stated. “Together, we can revolutionize how users manage their private keys, representing a major step forward for user security and adoption – not just for XRP Ledger users, but for everyone in crypto.”As noted, Alliance Members, including Acoer and BankSocial, are adopting DeRec standards and practices to make decentralized recovery accessible. They contribute to policy and oversee the development of DeRec-based solutions, with some already integrating the protocol into their systems.The DeRec Alliance represents a collective effort to overcome the challenges of digital asset self-custody and recovery, aiming to bring peace of mind to users and promote mainstream adoption of digital assets.“Improving the user experience and interoperability is required for mass adoption of digital assets and Web3 technologies more broadly. The innovative and democratized approach of DeRec is a huge step forward and we are excited to be a part of this evolution,” said Shayne Higdon, Co-Founder and CEO, The HBAR Foundation.“We are excited to join this alliance, recognizing the opportunity for greater levels of interoperability across chains and significantly improved user experience that will enable mainstream adoption of token holding,” said Ralf Kubli, Senior Director, Casper Association.

Andrew Tate Coin (ANDTATE) Will Explode 14,000% Ahead of MEXC Listing, While Shiba Inu, Bonk and Dogecoin Struggle



                    

Early investors in memecoins like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Bonk (BONK), and Dogecoin (DOGE) made astronomical returns, and Andrew Tate Coin (ANDTATE) presents a similar opportunity for a limited time.



Andrew Tate Coin (ANDTATE), a newly launched Solana memecoin, is poised to explode over 14,000% in a matter of days, as former Shiba Inu (SHIB), Bonk (BONK) and Dogecoin (DOGE) investors pour funds into this new token. 




ANDTATE will be listed on MEXC, one of the largest centralized exchanges in the world, within a few days – and this is a massively bullish development for the token, as millions of new investors will easily be able to buy Andrew Tate Coin.



Currently, Andrew Tate Coin can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jupiter and Raydium, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. 



To buy ANDTATE on these platforms, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Andrew Tate Coin by entering its contract address – Cp7qyqdzXAqF7fqKXzS8LwTE7JQvh2V3vYGnDdx6j4ii – in the receiving field.




ANDTATE currently has a market cap of just under $20,000, meaning it has huge upside potential.



Early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and Bonk (BONK) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. 



If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner.

Solana Drops on FTX Liquidation, Open Interest Drops - DailyCoin


        
Solana’s price experiences a downturn following FTX announcement.



Open interest drops on heightened uncertainty. 



Technical indicators still show bullish signals. 
Solana, known for high speed and low fees, has recently shown resilience amid the ongoing FTX bankruptcy. Despite large sales of FTX’s Solana holdings to major institutions, the token has so far been shielded by significant lockups. However, Solana’s price recently dipped due to renewed concerns over FTX liquidation. This was followed by a significant drop in open interest, as traders reassess their positions. Solana Drops on Renewed Concerns Over FTXOn Thursday, May 9, Solana (SOL) dropped 3.43% to $143.08, triggered by FTX’s plan to sell its assets to repay creditors. FTX’s announcement read that, with the sale of all its assets, it would have enough funds to repay its creditors. 
Consequently, the concerns over liquidation have caused a decrease in derivatives trading. Solana’s derivatives trading volume decreased by 6.52% to $5.53 billion, suggesting that traders are holding back from speculative bets. This hesitation is further highlighted by a 5.53% drop in open interest, down to $1.80 billion, with traders reducing their exposure. In the last 24 hours, Solana witnessed $7.61 million in total liquidations, with long positions accounting for $4.7 million and short positions for $2.91 million. However, this could change if Solana experiences a rebound; data suggests this may be likely. Long-short ratios reveal traders’ optimism about Solana’s potential rebound. For instance, the long-short ratio on Binance is 2.3557, meaning that more accounts are betting on a SOL rebound. On OKX, the ratio is 1.75, showing a similar optimistic sentiment. Technical analysis also shows bullish signals.Solana Technicals Lean BullishSolana’s technical indicators reveal a predominantly bullish sentiment. For one, both the 10-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA) at 144.29 and the Simple Moving Average (SMA) at 142.20 signal buy. However, longer-term moving averages, including the 30-day EMA and SMA, indicate potential resistance at higher levels. 
Oscillators are generally neutral, with the Relative Strength Index (RSI) at 47.89, which indicates neither overbought nor oversold conditions. Moreover, the Stochastic %K at 64.59 and the MACD Level at -3.00 both suggest neutral to slight bullish momentum. The indicators show a generally positive sentiment towards SOL/USD in the short term while indicating a more neutral outlook in the medium term. On The Flipside
Technical indicators reflect current market sentiment rather than a prediction of future movements. 



Solana has been battling with ongoing congestion issues, largely caused by an increase in DEX volumes. 
Why This MattersUnderstanding Solana’s technicals provides insight into the market’s reactions to SOL’s FTX sales.

Ether Prices Drop Amid SEC Uncertainty and Technical Corrections, Despite Bullish Patterns



                    

Today’s market sees a downturn in the value of Ethereum‘s Ether token, largely influenced by negative developments within the cryptocurrency sphere. 



As of May 7, the price of Ether fell to $3,022, marking a decline of around 6.20% from its previous day’s peak. 




This downward trend is not isolated to Ether; Bitcoin also experienced a similar fall of approximately 4% during the same period.



A significant factor contributing to this decline is the uncertainty surrounding the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission’s (SEC) handling of a proposed Ether exchange-traded fund (ETF). 



The SEC has postponed its decision regarding the ETF application by Invesco and Galaxy Digital to July 2024. 




The delay is due to the SEC’s need for more public comments and to consider further regulatory aspects before allowing trading on the Cboe BZX Exchange.



This comes at a time when the SEC is scrutinizing Ethereum more closely, especially after its shift from a proof-of-work (PoW) to a proof-of-stake (PoS) consensus mechanism.



SEC Chairman Gary Gensler hinted that staking mechanisms in cryptocurrencies could meet the criteria set by the Howey test to classify as securities.



The postponement dampens potential price boosts that might have resulted from increased institutional investment through the ETF. 




Another blow to the cryptocurrency market came with the SEC issuing a Wells notice to Robinhood on May 6, regarding potential securities violations in its cryptocurrency operations.

This notice could signal upcoming enforcement actions, fostering a climate of regulatory uncertainty that may affect Ether and other digital currencies adversely.



Ether’s current price movement also aligns with a technical correction phase, entering what is known as the “sell-off zone.” 



This area includes both a descending trendline resistance and Ether’s 50-day exponential moving average, which have historically capped its price rises.



Despite these challenges, technical analysis suggests that Ether’s market outlook could still be bullish. 



It’s recognized within a falling wedge pattern—a setup that often precedes upward price movements once the upper trendline is breached. 



If Ether breaks above this boundary, it might ascend to between $3,640 and $4,115 during May.



However, if the price breaks below the pattern’s lower trendline, it could invalidate the bullish scenario, potentially dropping to around $2,780, aligning with its 200-day exponential moving average and the 0.5% Fibonacci retracement line.

Record-breaking user engagement on Polkadot despite price slump

Polkadot blockchain activity has surged to record levels, with active addresses hitting all-time highs for two consecutive months.Data from DotLake indicates the network boasted around 650,000 active addresses on-chain as of the end of April. The growth continues the uptrend that saw the number of active blockchain addresses surpass its previous high of 605,000 in March.Polkadot Active Addresses. (Source: DotLake)Polkadot said this milestone represents a significant uptick in activity, marking a new all-time high for monthly active accounts since the launch of parachains in 2022.The rising active addresses can be primarily attributed to Moonbeam. During the reporting period, the parachain accounted for over 60% of these addresses, totaling 397,515, while Polkadot had only 136,612 addresses.Moonbeam is an Ethereum-compatible smart contract parachain on Polkadot that is attracting considerable attention from the community. According to data from Polkadot Insider, the network had the highest user acquisition among Polkadot’s parachains in April.Meanwhile, Polkadot’s number of unique addresses with non-zero balances decreased slightly, dropping from 6.96 million in March to 6.8 million at the end of April. Furthermore, the total number of transactions on the network also saw a modest decline to 11.07 million in April, slightly down from 11.5 million in March.DOT’s price subduedPolkadot’s rising metrics have yet to translate into an improved price performance for the network’s native DOT token.Polkadot’s DOT 30-days Price Performance. (Source: Tradingview)According to CryptoSlate’s data, DOT’s price has fallen more than 20% within the last 30 days to $6.9 as of press time. The performance mirrors the general trend observed in the crypto market during the reporting period, with Bitcoin and other digital assets struggling to reach the highs set earlier in the year.Nonetheless, crypto analyst Michaël van de Poppe argued that Polkadot was “heavily undervalued” and believes its “valuation is super low compared to Ethereum” because of its impending JAM Upgrade, which will improve the network’s operations.Disclaimer: CryptoSlate has received a grant from the Polkadot Foundation to produce content about the Polkadot ecosystem.

Will May Make Or Break Bitcoin? Crucial Events To Watch This Month


								May brings a series of pivotal events that could significantly influence the trajectory of Bitcoin and the broader crypto market.
These events, ranging from regulatory decisions to economic indicators, appear capable of profoundly swaying market dynamics.

Regulatory And Economic Indicators On The Horizon
This month is marked by crucial dates, starting with a significant meeting involving Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell. His upcoming press conference today is particularly noteworthy, following recent economic data showing a dip in consumer confidence amidst persistent wage pressures.
In his previous addresses, Powell has highlighted ongoing challenges in curbing inflation and the “robustness” of the job market, which continue to influence monetary policy expectations.
Moreover, on May 15, the release of the US Consumer Price Index (CPI) for April is eagerly anticipated. This event is closely followed by the announcement of the United States Securities and Exchange Commission’s (SEC) decision on approving Spot Ethereum ETFs.

The outcomes of these events could either dampen or ignite investor enthusiasm, with significant repercussions for market liquidity and volatility.
Particularly, the SEC’s response to VanEck’s Ethereum spot ETF application on May 23 and a Bitcoin spot option ETF application on May 29 are seen as potential catalysts for market movement.
Market Impact And Analyst Insights On Bitcoin
The anticipation of higher interest rates continuing longer than previously expected is already impacting the cryptocurrency markets.
Bitcoin, for example, has witnessed a sharp decline, plunging by over 6% in just 24 hours, marking one of its lowest points in recent months at $56,757. This downturn has led to considerable market liquidation, with Coinglass reporting over $394.82 million in liquidations, affecting 106,104 traders within the same period.

With his deep understanding of market patterns, renowned financial analyst Peter Brandt suggests that Bitcoin might face further declines before any potential recovery.
According to Brandt, Bitcoin could dip into the $40,000 region as part of its market correction phase before possibly embarking on a new bullish run.

Brandt also pointed out that despite various market stimulants such as halving events and spot ETF launches in past years, Bitcoin has struggled to surpass its peak prices from three years ago.

Crypto Analyst Says Ethereum Price Will Drop To $2,500, Here’s Why


																The Ethereum price has been closing mirroring the performance of Bitcoin recently and since the Bitcoin price has been on a downtrend, the ETH price has followed. However, Ethereum on its own seems to possess more bearish fundamentals compared to Bitcoin, leading crypto analysts to believe that the second-largest cryptocurrency by market cap will fall further from here.
Ethereum Poised To Crash Further
A crypto analyst known as Shin Forex took to the TradingView website to share an interesting analysis of the Ethereum price. The analysis, which focused on the ETH/BTC chart, unveiled some concerning developments in the ETH price.

The analyst explained that during this time, the liquidity in Ethereum has been dwindling. Instead of flowing toward altcoins like ETH, it is instead flowing toward Bitcoin. This suggests growing disinterest in Ethereum from investors and as liquidity flows to Bitcoin, Ethereum has nothing propping it up at this time.
Furthermore, the crypto analyst explains that the ETH/BTC pair has now broken below its support of 0.05. Now, this drop below its support level is important given what has happened each time that it broke. Shin Forex points back to the last two market cycles, one in 2016 and one in 2019, of the ETH/BTC breaking below its support.
Both times that this has happened, a crash in the price has followed, before it can rally again. The crypto analyst does not expect this time to be any different and believes that ETH/BTC will fall below 0.04. If this happens, it will send Ethereum spiraling and the analyst has set a price target of around $2,500 for this.
Can ETH Price Survive The Crash?
In the short term, the Ethereum price doesn’t look to good, especially as the altcoin is currently trending downward inside its current channel, according to the crypto analyst. However, zooming out to the larger timeframe can help give an inkling of how the ETH price could perform after the crash.
Looking at Shin Forex’s chart of the last two times that a formation like this occurred, it has also set a precedent for money to flow back into Ethereum. In November 2016, the price had crashed but in a few months, there was a massive recovery as ETH/BTC rose to a new all-time high.

Source: TradingView.com
A similar thing happened the next time in 2019, with the crash coming ahead of a market rally, albeit a bit slower at this time. So, if this trend holds, then the ETH crash is inevitable. However, a recovery is expected that will likely kickstart the beginning of another massive rally.

For now, bears continue to dominate the Ethereum market and have successfully dragged the price down below $3,000. It is trading at. $2,975 at the time of this writing, with a small 0.36% decline in the last day, according to Coinmarketcap.

Toncoin Spikes on Notcoin Rollout as Bitcoin, Ethereum Trade Flat - Decrypt

We do the research, you get the alpha!Get exclusive reports and access to key insights on airdrops, NFTs, and more! Subscribe now to Alpha Reports and up your game!Go to Alpha ReportsToncoin, the native cryptocurrency of The Open Network (TON), is one of the biggest gainers atop the crypto markets Thursday amid launch news about one of the network’s most anticipated tokens. And it comes as the two largest overall coins, Bitcoin and Ethereum, have barely moved over the last day.Over the past 24 hours, TON is up nearly 13% to a current price of $6.46, per data from CoinGecko. That makes it the second-largest coin in the top 100 cryptocurrencies by market cap behind Akash Network (AKT), an AI-centric cloud computing project that’s seen a 16% jump on the day.Much of the gains came after The Open Network project Notcoin, a viral Telegram-based game, announced that its anticipated token NOT will be launched on May 16. The project attracted 35 million players ahead of April 1, when the “mining phase” ended, and the launch has been on the horizon for weeks amid a couple of previously missed listing targets.One of the biggest TON price increases so far on Thursday came shortly after crypto exchange Binance announced that it would offer billions of NOT tokens as rewards to its customers via pre-listing staking rewards.Along with a similar campaign from rival exchange OKX, more than 4 billion NOT tokens will be distributed via such rewards initiatives. OKX users, in particular, will need to stake TON tokens to earn rewards, which could drive an increase in Toncoin purchases in the days ahead.In the last day, perpetual-centric decentralized exchange (DEX) dYdX also announced support for Toncoin, while Hong Kong’s HashKey exchange listed TON on Thursday. With today’s price action added in, Toncoin is now up 24% over the last week.There have been few big gainers among the top 100 cryptocurrencies over the past day, however, and as noted, Bitcoin and Ethereum are doing little.Bitcoin’s price is up 1% on the day to $62,420 as of this writing, marking a 5% total gain over the past seven days, while Ethereum has nudged up by about 2% today to $3,020—but over the past week, it hasn’t even gained by 1%.DisclaimerThe views and opinions expressed by the author are for informational purposes only and do not constitute financial, investment, or other advice.Edited by Ryan Ozawa.Stay on top of crypto news, get daily updates in your inbox.

Zombie Coin (ZOMCOIN) to Surge 8,000% After Solana Launch, Looks to Challenge Shiba Inu and DogeCoin



                    

Zombie Coin (ZOMCOIN) could become a viral memecoin, like Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE).



Zombie Coin (ZOMCOIN), a Solana memecoin that was launched today, is aiming to challenge other memecoin giants, such as Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE).




Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Zombie Coin presents a similar opportunity.



Zombie Coin has market cap below $15,000 at the moment, meaning that when it just reaches a modest market cap of $200,000-$500,000, early investors would generate returns of 2,000%-5,000% in a matter of days or hours.



The exciting memecoin is poised to rally 8,000% in the coming two days, and Zombie Coin could potentially reach a multi-million dollar market cap within a few weeks.




Currently, Zombie Coin can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jupiter and Raydium, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days.



To buy Zombie Coin on these platforms, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Zombie Coin by entering its contract address – FbkoYsCAPbcyJkSoqXTxDKKoGQrYoqgtdLf9GBEqy2vr – in the receiving field.

If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner.




The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum.



This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like ZOMCOIN.

Decentralizing Ethereum with Heroglyphs | Bankless


Whether we want to admit it or not, centralization remains a significant concern and issue for our industry, facing most major blockchains, even Ethereum.To combat this, protocols like Rocket Pool and Etherfi have worked to lower the bar for people to join the network as validators. A new protocol, Heroglyphs, approaches this problem differently, turning to speculation to make the solo staker’s role more enticing. Developed by OGs like 0xMaki, the anon co-founder of Sushiswap, this new system seeks to harness the often overlooked potential of Ethereum’s Graffiti—a small segment of arbitrary data in block headers—to empower a more distributed and robust network of complete validators by providing them the ability to earn, deploy, and lease (yes, lease) tokens. via HeroglyphsEthereum’s Centralization IssueWhile Ethereum's shift to Proof of Stake (PoS) brought many improvements, like energy efficiency, it also ushered in a new era of concerns around centralization. Namely, the consolidation of validation power in the hands of a few large operators poses significant risks, including greater vulnerability to regulatory pressures (as we’ve seen with block builders and relays) and potential network failures. via Ethereum Censorship DashboardThis centralization dilutes the foundational decentralized ethos of blockchains, and needs to be guarded against. Here, then, cue in Heroglyphs.How Heroglyphs Attempts to Solve ThisHeroglyphs aims to tackle validator centralization through a feature called Graffiti, which uses a small piece of arbitrary data that validators can include in the blocks they propose. via Heroglyphs WhitepaperThrough Graffiti, Heroglyphs introduces three key operations: encoding, translating, and leasing, each designed to maximize the potential of this small piece of data within its transactions. Let’s break these pillars down:Encoding involves embedding critical operational data into the Ethereum block's Graffiti like, encoding commands for the creation, emission, transfer, and transformation of assets such as NFTs, memecoins, and beyond. By inserting this data into the Graffiti, the block space becomes a secure and immutable medium for developing tokens and storing detailed transactional instructions.Translating follows the encoding, acting as the operational executor within Ethereum. Whether minting new NFTs or processing transactions for memecoins, the translator system ensures that these operations adhere to that token’s outlined parameters encoded in the Graffiti.Leasing introduces a strategic and economic layer to the use of Graffiti. In this model, validators or miners assign and pay a regular tax on a value to each Heroglyphs "ticker," i.e. token. This value determines their operational lease and sets the stage for competition. For example, other validators can outbid each other for leases if they see a ticker as undervalued and want it for themselves. Most revenue from leasing and actions such as minting or transferring tickers in the Heroglyphs network is shared among all complete validators. via HeroglyphsAll in all, this new platform is a novel and degen-centric approach to decentralizing Ethereum’s network. The grand vision? Use Graffiti to foster a new meta-system where solo stakers are actively incentivized to participate thanks to making the validator experience more lucrative, engaging, and fun. Now validators have the tools to create and manage tokens all their own, granting the role a new privilege. If the Heroglyphs mission pans out, then Ethereum will become more robust, and we’ll have a fresh case study in how speculation can be beneficial and provide real value in crypto. In the meantime, this is a protocol to watch around the memecoin and NFT frontier!

Crypto Mixers Facing the Blender as U.S. Amps up Enforcement - DailyCoin


        
United States policy makers are pushing for stronger regulations in the crypto mixer sector.



The DOJ has recently commenced enforcement actions against the sector.



The lawmakers have raised concerns over the Tether stablecoin.
Recent months have seen regulatory actions focused on the crypto mixing sector by United States authorities, marked by sanctions against service providers and increased alarm on their activities. The increasing enforcement has seen the Justice Department clamp down on two notable mixers, Tornado Cash and Samourai Wallet, alleging the facilitation of illegal financial transactions.Taking the enforcement actions a step further, four lawmakers have proposed a bill to clamp down on the section.Crypto Mixers Face SanctionsDuring a House hearing on May 7, US Representative Sean Casten introduced the Blockchain Integrity Act, an upcoming regulatory framework targeting the crypto mixing sector.
Co-signed by three additional democrats, Brad Sherman, Bill Foster, and Emanuel Cleaver, the Blockchain Integrity Act will address concerns associated with mixers to mitigate their roles in facilitating illicit transactions for sanctioned individuals.By imposing a two-year ban that prohibits financial institutions, including crypto exchanges, from transacting with funds that have gone through digital asset mixers, the act will allow regulatory watchdogs such as the SEC and DoJ to investigate the illicit activities associated with the sector.According to Casten, mixers are key to allowing illicit actors to instantaneously move massive amounts of money around the globe for criminal purposes without detection”
The presumption should be that these are money laundering channels,” stated Casten, adding "Let's go through and get that cleaned up and fixed," he stated during the hearing.Congressman Sherman added that the legislation is a vital first step in banning crypto mixers in the United States, aiding the litigation of the sector’s dangers.Crypto mixers are not the only flagged sources of concern among the Democrats.According to Rep Casten, the Tether (USDT), stablecoin has been at the core of terror financing over the past years and has evolved into a killer app for criminals.Casten emphasized that USDT’s place in funding was machines for countries such as Russia, adding that it was the favored choice for the majority of the crypto assets adopted by the terrorist troop Hamas.In response to the Democrat, former SEC official John Reed Stark asserted the lack of transparency regarding Tether’s auditing, stating that it fails to declare whether its offerings are backed by real securities openly.“Tether claims to have some sort of audit, but it’s essentially a satellite snapshot of days of its events,” stated Clark.The representatives stressed the need for stringent anti-money laundering measures in stablecoin regulations and emphasized the SEC’s role in protecting investors through enforcement actions.On the FlipsideWhy This MattersThe ongoing enforcement actions against crypto mixers reflect the tightening regulatory standards against the crypto industry, which could significantly impact service providers and investors. Read more about this crypto mixer’s response to the mounting regulatory pressure:Wasabi Wallet Exits Mixing Sector as DOJ Pressure Piles onHere’s how policymakers are opposing the crypto industry, read more:“Crypto Is A Garden of Snakes:” Rep Sherman Backs SEC Action

Bugs in Gains Network fork let traders profit 900% on every trade: Report

Two different bugs in a fork of the Gains Network leveraged trading protocol could have allowed traders to profit 900% on every trade, regardless of the price of the token traded, according to an April 19 report from blockchain security firm Zellic. One of the bugs existed in a previous version of Gains but was later patched. The other was only found in a fork of the protocol. According to Zellic, its staff informed the developers of Gains forks Gambit Trade, Holdstation Exchange, and Krav Trade of the vulnerability, and these development teams have ensured their protocols do not contain such two flaws. However, other Gains forks may still be vulnerable, Zellic warned.According to its official website, Gains Network is an ecosystem of decentralized finance (DeFi) products on Polygon and Arbitrum. The official name for its leveraged trading app is “gTrade.” It has facilitated over $25 billion in derivatives volume since its inception in May 2023, according to blockchain analytics platform DefiLlama.User interface for gTrade, the Gains Network leveraged trading app. Source: Gains NetworkZellic claimed that several popular DeFi trading apps are derived from Gains Network’s base code, including the aforementioned Gambit Trade and Holdstation, as well as many other protocols. They discovered the exploit while studying a particular fork but declined to name which one they discovered it in.According to the report, Gains Network contracts allow users to open either a market, reversal or momentum trade order. A market order buys or sells an asset immediately, regardless of price. When a user asks to open a momentum or reversal trade, the smart contract records an “order” that contains data about what price the user is willing to trade at. Once this price is reached, any user can call the executeLimitOrder function to fill the order. The user who calls the execution does not have to be the same one who placed the order. Users who call the execution get paid a small “execution fee” for performing this role. This allows users to place limit (momentum) and stop-limit (reversal) orders similar to the way they can in a centralized exchange, but without needing a centralized entity to perform the order fills.When a user places an order, they can set a take-profit price, stop-loss price or both. The intention of this design is to allow traders to automatically exit a profitable trade at the take-profit point or a losing trade at the stop-loss point. Bug in Gains fork allowed 900% profit on buy ordersIn the Gains fork it studied, Zellic discovered that when an order was opened, the stop-loss price became stored in the “currentPrice” variable used to calculate profit and loss. This meant that if a user was able to set the stop-loss above the open price, they could automatically profit from any trade. For example, consider a scenario where the price of Bitcoin (BTC) was $63,000 and the user entered $62,000 as the open price and $64,000 as the stop-loss. In this case, if the price fell to $62,000, the order would become filled. But the price would be immediately below its stop-loss, triggering an automatic exit.In addition, the stop-loss set by the user would be recorded as the current price. This meant that the user would profit $2,000, even though the correct profit should have been approximately $0. This could have allowed an attacker to profit from every trade and eventually drain the protocol of all of its funds.To prevent this exploit, the protocol contained a check that threw a “wrong_sl” error if the user attempted to set their stop-loss above their open price on a buy order.Gains Network fork check to prevent wrong take-profit or stop-loss. Source: ZellicHowever, the investigators discovered that this check could be bypassed in certain circumstances. When a user first opened an order, they set the price at which they wanted to open the trade, which was then recorded in the variable “openPrice.” It was at this point that the check was performed. However, the function used to execute an order changed this variable to the value of “a.Price,” which was the current price plus the price impact from the order being opened. This meant that if the user entered an extremely high open price, an executor could bypass the check by simply executing the order. This also allowed the executor to fill the order at an open price below what it was originally set to. As an example, Zellic considered the idea of an attacker who places an order to buy a token at $100000e10 ($1 quadrillion) and sets a stop-loss at $1 less than this or $999.999999999999 trillion. Once the order is placed, the attacker then executes their own order, causing openPrice to change from $100000e10 to whatever the current price is after the trade’s price impact is taken into account. The trade then executes and becomes open. As long as the resulting opening price is below the stop-loss that was originally set, it can now be closed by executing the stop-loss. When the attacker executes their own stop-loss, they profits from the difference between the closing price and the price of the stop-loss.The trade would have resulted in a 900% profit for the attacker, Zellic claimed.Gains fork exploit example. Source: ZellicThis flaw was not present in Gains Network at the time the Zellic team discovered it. It only existed in the forked version it was investigating. However, in the process of studying this issue, it ran across a second flaw that was present in an earlier version of Gains itself.Second bug allowed 900% profit on sell ordersThe second bug allowed traders to profit 900% on sell orders regardless of price action.When a trade was closed in the Gains fork, it converted the user’s stop-loss or take-profit point into a variable called “int,” which it then used to calculate profit in percentage terms. But if a user entered a stop-loss or take-profit value that was exactly 2^256-1, the resulting calculations would have caused “int” to become negative. This was because 2^256-1 is the max value for positive numbers in Ethereum, causing any value above it to “overflow” or start over at zero and because the calculation added the open price to its total. In the Solidity programming language, 2^256-1 is also known as “type(uint256).max.” According to Zellic, as long as an attacker used leverage of greater than 9x, they could profit 900% from this exploit:“Let’s consider a sell order, with currentPrice as type(uint256).max. The resultant value of diff would be openPrice + 1 (int(type(uint256).max) = -1 ), and hence the profit percent would be nearly equal to 100 * leverage. Therefore, if the leverage is greater than 9, the function will return the profit as 900%.”There was a check in the contract that attempted to prevent 2^256-1 from being entered as a take-profit. However, this check was only performed at the moment the order was first opened. If the user changed their take-profit point after the order was opened, they could bypass the check and enter 2^256-1 as the take-profit, allowing them to gain an automatic 900% profit each time they traded.This second flaw did exist in a previous version of Gains but was subsequently patched. The current version does not contain this flaw, as it performs the check when the take-profit and stop-loss are updated as well as when they are first set.Zellic reportedly informed all of the above forks about these two security flaws and contacted the Crypto Security Alliance in an attempt to find other protocols that may be affected by them. However, it warned that some Gains forks may still contain these bugs, putting users’ funds at risk of being drained.Cointelegraph contacted Gains Network, Gambit Trade, Holdstation Exchange, and Krav Trade for comment but did not receive a response by the time of publication.Gains Network claims that it provides the “real spot price” of listed assets, as opposed to what it sees as less accurate prices based on perpetual contracts. It also claims to offer superior forex trading compared to competitors.Related: Libra-related Sui blockchain fixes critical bug that put ‘billions’ at risk

Playing Fantasy on Blast | Bankless


What do you get when you cross Crypto Twitter (CT) with NFTs, fantasy sports, and Blast farming season?Fantasy.top.Fantasy is a social trading card game (TCG) on the Blast L2 centered around collecting, trading, and competing with digital cards representing the most popular CT influencers. It’s become a sensation fast, too, as the game has already racked up nearly 30k users and +9,000 ETH worth of trading volume since its May 1st, 2024 launch. via hildobbyThe big idea? Join tournaments with 5-card decks, with Twitter engagement metrics determining the final winner. Banger posts from “Hero” accounts on Twitter translate to more points for holders of that influencer on Fantasy. via BREADCards can be purchased in VRGDA auctions, which rise and fall with demand, or on Fantasy’s native secondary marketplace, where players can list and buy Heroes to manage and improve their decks. via FantasyHeroes cards come in four different rarities—Common, Rare, Epic, and Legendary—with each tier granting 1x, 1.5x, 2x, and 2.5x score multipliers respectively. Additionally, every Hero has a unique score and rank based on their engagement over the past week, and you can burn 5 of a kind if you want to increase a card’s tier for better scores. via BREADWith at least 5 cards in hand, you’ll be ready to enter tournaments, with the first two already having distributed over $4M worth of prize money to Heroes and players. Tournaments are conducted across 5 possible leagues, and the first batch of players just progressed to the Silver League, paving the way for them to earn higher rewards. This brings us ‘round to the question of why the game has taken off so fast, to which I think there are a handful of reasons:Farming for Blast Points and Blast GOLD is in full swing, so people are hungry for trying new Blast appsCT degens love gaming and gambling, and this is a gamified avenue to gamble on each other, which has created a layer of social intrigueHeroes receive game revenue payouts in ETH, Blast GOLD, and FAN points, offering a novel monetization avenue for something they would already be doing anyways, i.e. posting on TwitterMore than a few early players have already made considerable gains, both via flipping cards and tournament rewards, and players can also use their Heroes NFTs to enter win Blast Jackpot prizesTaken altogether, these factors suggest Fantasy has plenty of room to run for the foreseeable future as more people flock to the buzz and possibilities here. That said, going forward it’ll be key for the platform to lock down its anti-botting strategy to keep tournaments fair and to continue rolling out new advances to polish up the player experience. If it can achieve these pillars, Fantasy’s near-term prospects will continue looking good. If you’re keen to try the game, sign up with your Twitter account on fantasy.top to receive an embedded Privy wallet that you can deposit into (or export into MetaMask, etc., for entering your cards for Blast Jackpots). To move ETH in, I recommend Relay by Reservoir for quick transfers to Blast.All in all, Fantasy certainly won’t be for everyone, but if you’re looking to dive into the Blast NFT scene and potentially reap rewards, it's a top contender to check out right now. My suggestion? Analyze available Heroes, buy cheap floor cards, and try steadily grinding up to better scores!

EU securities watchdog to review crypto eligibility for UCITS investments

The European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA) has initiated a review of the rules governing crypto asset investments by UCITS (Undertakings for Collective Investment in Transferable Securities) as part of a broader examination of the EU’s financial regulatory framework.The review comes in response to a request from the European Commission (EC) to ensure that UCITS rules keep pace with rapid market developments, including the burgeoning crypto sector.Reevaluating asset inclusionSince the implementation of the UCITS Eligible Assets Directive in 2007, the landscape of financial instruments has expanded significantly, necessitating a reevaluation of what assets should be accessible for UCITS funds.These funds are known for their high level of investor protection and are a popular choice among retail and institutional investors across Europe and globally.The current regulatory framework defines the criteria for assets that UCITS can invest in, with the aim of ensuring liquidity and risk diversification.However, the rise of digital assets like cryptocurrencies has presented new challenges and opportunities that the existing directives do not specifically address. Digital assets, known for their high volatility and emerging market trends, pose unique risks and potential rewards for investors that need to be regulated appropriately.Notably, UCITS funds typically revolve around securities, and including crypto could imply that digital assets would be regulated as such in the EU. The watchdog has yet to clarify its stance on the matter.Consultation processESMA’s call for evidence seeks input from stakeholders on how to adapt the UCITS framework to include digital assets, focusing on direct and indirect exposures. The agency is particularly interested in understanding the implications of allowing UCITS to invest in crypto — both in terms of investor protection and market stability.The consultation process, open until Aug. 7, will gather feedback from investment firms, consumer advocacy groups, and other financial entities.ESMA will consider these responses in preparing its technical advice to the Commission, which is expected to address whether and how the scope of eligible assets should be expanded to include crypto and other contemporary investment vehicles.As the financial markets continue to evolve, the outcome of this review could significantly impact the accessibility of crypto investments for European funds, potentially paving the way for greater integration of digital assets into mainstream financial portfolios.The findings will also influence how these assets are regulated, balancing innovation with investor protection in the rapidly changing landscape of global finance.

Consensys Lawsuit Over Ethereum Won’t Deter SEC, Former Regulator Says - Decrypt

A preemptive lawsuit filed in Texas federal court aims to definitively determine Ethereum’s regulatory status. But the move by blockchain software company Consensys in its home state may be far from the final legal showdown over crypto’s second-top coin, as the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has national reach.“The SEC can bring a case anywhere in the country,” Christopher Gerold, a partner at Lowenstein Sandler LLP told Decrypt. “They can just as easily file a lawsuit today and allege sale of unregistered securities in a jurisdiction that they find favorable: California, New York, [or Washington] D.C.”In its complaint, the MetaMask maker claimed the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has internally viewed Ethereum as a security for over a year. (Disclosure: Consensys is one of 22 investors in Decrypt.) Among other rulings related to MetaMask’s features, Consensys seeks a judicial declaration that Ethereum is not a security.Ethereum co-founder and Consensys CEO Joe Lubin said Thursday that the firms’ lawsuit is aimed at “getting clarity from U.S. courts.” But the legal tussle, despite being in Texas, probably won’t bring clarity about on its own, according to Gerold, who previously served as the chief of the New Jersey Bureau of Securities. “You have a lot of judges [in Texas] that are concerned about the expansion of federal agencies and the role they play,” Gerold said. “If you're anti-regulation [...], that's where you bring your case.”Consensys may have made a strategic choice in filing its lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Texas, where “judge shopping” has proved contentious. But that doesn’t preclude the SEC from picking its own favorable legal turf if it decides to move forward with a separate lawsuit, Gerold explained.If the SEC wanted to find that Ethereum was a security publicly, they don’t have to do it through the Consensys lawsuit, he continued. And depending on how higher courts rule as those cases are appealed, Ethereum could be considered a security in one part of the U.S. but not the other.“Something could be legal in New Jersey and illegal in Texas,” Gerold said, noting that federal circuit courts are not bound by the decisions of other federal circuit courts.A patchwork of case law could become cemented if the Supreme Court then decides not to take up the question of whether Ethereum is a security. Of course, Congress could step in at any moment with new laws that ultimately determine how digital assets are treated, Gerold said.The SEC has not filed any charges related to the Ethereum-centered investigation that Consensys alleges is occurring. And Gerold expects the agency will first seek to dismiss the case without telegraphing its internal thoughts on Ethereum’s legal status.A lawsuit from the SEC could then follow, which would build upon a Wells Notice issued to Consensys, as is usually the case, Gerold said. A Wells Notice from the SEC typically precedes formal charges. It could still be years until the regulatory matter over Ethereum is fully settled, coming to a head in several different courtrooms along the way.“There's different paths [that this] could go.” Gerold said. “But this idea that Consensys’ lawsuit is going to answer the question [of] whether Ethereum is a security or not—and that's the only forum that has that ability right now—is a fallacy.”Edited by Ryan Ozawa.Stay on top of crypto news, get daily updates in your inbox.

Joe Biden Is Trying to ‘Kill Crypto’, Says Cardano Creator - Decrypt

A fight over a non-binding resolution passed in the U.S. House has erupted into a broader battle, pitting the crypto industry against the Biden administration.“The Biden administration has engaged in a coordinated effort to kill crypto,” wrote Charles Hoskinson, creator of Cardano, on Twitter.Yesterday, the White House said U.S. Pres. Joe Biden would veto resolution H.J. Res. 109, which demanded that the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) retract a staff bulletin on digital asset custody accounting. The resolution won a bipartisan vote of 229-193, declaring that the SEC’s views were holding back American innovation in the digital asset space.Hoskinson declared the move only the latest in what he called "Operation Chokepoint 2.0."“This November, if you vote for Joe Biden as a cryptocurrency holder, please understand that the intent of this administration is to destroy the American cryptocurrency industry,” he said on a Twitter livestream late Wednesday. “Understand that. It’s unambiguously clear.”The White House argued that the resolution would hurt the SEC's efforts to protect investors in crypto markets and safeguard the broader financial system. But crypto enthusiasts don’t see it that way—and many believe that former president Donald Trump will be the better option in November's election."The [Trump] administration had its issues but mostly ignored our industry,” Hoskinson tweeted.“The enforcement is tone-deaf and continues to carry on the same policy, which has cost tens of thousands if not hundreds of thousands of American jobs as well as the loss of a trillion-dollar industry," Hoskinson said.“They have confiscated, lied, and repeatedly throughout the years hurt our industry in every way possible, whether it be restricting access to bank accounts, regulation through enforcement, anti clarity, in some cases reversing decisions that had already been made, and now obstructing the legislative process,” he continued. “Understand that a vote for Biden is a vote against cryptocurrencies.”Ryan Selkis, founder of Messari, also expressed concern about Biden’s position on crypto.“If Biden is reelected, they’ll hit stablecoins by requiring bank licenses for issuers, all tokens for being unregistered securities, all DeFi for unlicensed money transmission, Bitcoin mining, layers on top of BTC, and self-hosted wallets to collect crypto unrealized gains.”The CEO of Irreverent Labs, Rahul Sood, also expressed his disappointment, suggesting that voting for Biden is now even harder for those who care about crypto in the U.S."Wow—well, that settles it,” Sood tweeted. ”Thanks for making it easy, Joe."The Founder of Helium, Amir Haleem, echoed the sentiment. "Sad state of affairs,” he wrote on Twitter. “If you care about crypto in the US, voting for Biden is now even more impossible.”The document at the root of the dispute is a so-called Staff Accounting Bulletin (SAB), which SEC Chair Gary Gensler has said is uncontroversial."It basically addresses whether liabilities should be on the balance sheet, and what we have found actually in bankruptcy court, time and again, many times now, is that indeed, bankruptcy courts have said that crypto assets are not bankruptcy remote,” he said in December. “So, the staff, as they have done over 50 years, did really good work."But Gensler has many vocal critics on Capitol Hill.Republican Patrick McHenry accused him of wanting to “choke off” the crypto industry. Even the courts have criticized the SEC over its “arbitrary and capricious” decisions.Crypto holders may be growing in importance as a constituency worth courting by politicians. A recent study by the Blockchain Association found that 90% of all crypto holders plan to vote in the next election, with the majority worried that politicians may be stifling innovation via overregulation. 45% liked or self identified as Democrats, 43% as Republicans, and 11% identified as independent.Biden’s rival, Donal Trump is taking the opportunity to earn the adoration of concerned crypto holders.“Crypto is moving out of the U.S. because of hostility towards crypto,” Trump said during a special event in Florida yesterday. “Gensler is very much against it, the Democrats are very much against it, but I’m good with it.”This pro-crypto stance sharply contrasts with his previous statements back from when he was president of the United States. “I am not a fan of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, which are not money, and whose value is highly volatile and based on thin air,” Trump wrote on Twitter in 2019.Stay on top of crypto news, get daily updates in your inbox.

Meme coin traders can benefit from fundamental analysis, says HashKey Capital's Jupiter Zhang - Crypto Briefing




Meme coins registered 1,300% returns on average during the first quarter, according to a report by CoinGecko. This made meme coins the most profitable narrative in that period and made the number of tokens issued on Solana, the hottest blockchain for meme coin trading, reach an all-time high of 14,648 tokens launched.In this landscape, new investors might be tempted to spray their funds over different meme coins and hope for stellar growth. Jupiter Zhang, head of liquid funds at investment firm HashKey Capital, highlights that “for every success story there are dozens more failures.”“Market fundamentals have never been more important. […] FOMO is not a long-term strategy,” shared Zhang with Crypto Briefing. “Fundamental analysis provides a structured, analytical approach to investment, especially crucial in a volatile market like crypto. While the high returns from meme coins might seem attractive, they are often driven by hype and speculation rather than underlying economic value.”Recently, HashKey Capital published a 217-page book titled “Digital Asset Valuation Framework”, a guide to fundamental analysis in crypto. Zhang is the lead author, and he says that by understanding fundamental analysis, investors can identify assets with real potential and longevity, reducing risk and fostering a more sustainable investment strategy.“This is crucial because, as the meme coin narrative shows, not all that glitters in the crypto world is gold.”Why bother with fundamentals?Meme coins, as the name suggests, rise by backpacking on a famous meme. Because of this, most of them usually have short lifespans. Investors might not be inclined to learn how to do proper research since spreading money might be more profitable.“Even in the seemingly whimsical area of meme coins, fundamental analysis can provide insights. For instance, evaluating the community engagement, development activity, and use cases of the token can offer a glimpse into its potential sustainability and growth,” explains Zhang.Moreover, fundamental analysis can be useful for identifying what meme coins have a strong enough narrative to sustain longer-term interest from those that are likely to fizzle out with the fading of initial hype.“Fundamental analysis doesn’t necessarily lie in opposition to narrative-driven investing, which focuses primarily on the stories and trends that capture market interest and investor sentiment. They can be used in tandem to provide a more well-rounded evaluation of a digital asset’s potential.”Zhang adds that while fundamental analysis aims for long-term growth against the market’s often emotional and speculative waves, narrative-driven investments are useful to ride the waves of market enthusiasm and investor psychology, potentially reaping quick rewards.However, narrative-driven investing often leads to the fear of missing out (FOMO), and that usually ends in bad investments. In other words, narrative-driven demands an effort to time the market and move swiftly before the narrative shifts, while fundamental analysis delves into the intrinsic value of an investment, looking to identify assets with strong fundamentals that suggest a higher intrinsic value than the market price.“This is a more methodical path to potentially sustainable gains, as it requires rigorous assessment of data. Some things we look at when evaluating the fundamentals of digital assets: a thorough evaluation of a token’s utility, governance structure, supply mechanics, technical stack, and potential innovations there.”More VCs into meme coinsThe meme coin market was always a way for investors to bet without generating returns for VCs. That is because when a token from a protocol is made available to the public, VCs already have their hands on it for a significantly smaller price. Consequently, if this token gets popular and its price jumps, VCs are the true winners.Meanwhile, since meme coins are issued by the community, this is one sector VCs can’t profit from. Or couldn’t until recently. Shiba Inu closed a $12 million funding round with the participation of Mechanism Capital, Big Brain Holdings, Cypher Capital, and Shima Capital, among others, and this may turn the tide in the meme coin market.“Across sectors, industries, and opportunities, investors will seek returns in all corners of the market. So large-scale investments in meme coins are not really surprising,” says Zhang about the recent movement of VCs into these tokens. “The fundraising success of Shiba Inu suggests that even meme coins can capture serious investor attention when they align with a compelling narrative and show potential for broader ecosystem development based on community engagement.”Therefore, that’s where fundamental analysis shows its weight. Zhang believes that as more people get equipped with fundamental analysis tools, the number of serious investments directed at selected meme coins will show sustained growth over time.“These will likely be the ones that demonstrate real utility, ongoing social value, or strategic significance within the crypto market, beyond just the initial hype.”

SUI Token Shatters Recovery Hopes as It Falls Below $1 Peg - DailyCoin


        
The SUI token is struggling to recover from its price lows.



SUI has fallen below its one dollar peg.



The Sui network recently celebrated its first year anniversary.
SUI, the native token of the SUI system, had an impressive start to the year, doubling its year-start value to reach new highs. However, the situation took a different turn when the token suffered a sharp decline on May 12, 2024, reaching a bottom low before seeing slight recovery gains.However, optimism for SUI’s rebound has been cut short as prospects further dwindle, with the token now recording a new low.Sui Token Plummets to $0.9 MarkAccording to CoinMarketCap data on Thursday, May 9, SUI, currently wavering at $0.995, has suffered an approximate 6% decline in the past 24 hours, The token’s current training price marks its week low value, dropping it approximately 14% from its highest point this week, $1.141.
The underperformance marks SUI’s third consecutive week of losses, which has seen the token drop a staggering 40% in the last 30 days. The downward trend, which commenced following the geopolitical tension between Israel and Iran, has dashed the initially heightened hopes for SUI to reclaim its $2 peg and surpass its all time high record of $2.18.Sui’s downward trend is not isolated, fueled by its vulnerability to negative market trends and inability to swiftly recover.

SEC Cripples Ripple’s Latest Stablecoin Project - Says It Qualifies As Securities Offering | Cryptopolitan

No other crypto firm has gone to war with the SEC as Ripple has. Unfortunately, the legal face-offs are not over yet. The SEC vs Ripple cases still continue in the courts today, and just recently, the SEC has hinted at a new possible avenue to sue the XRP issuer. The XRP issuer has been battling the SEC for about four years now in court. The legal battles have somewhat crippled the firm, limiting innovations and eventually hurting the growth of XRP. In response, Ripple announced its plans to launch a stablecoin, pegged to the US dollar, to compete against the larger stablecoin issuers like Tether and CENTRE – a joint venture between Coinbase and Circle. Ripple Labs’ attempt to launch the stablecoin has hit yet another roadblock, as the SEC says the stablecoin qualifies as an unregistered securities offering just like XRP. The company announced the Stablecoin plans last month, and since then, the regulator has not been resting. The SEC’s issue with Ripple Labs’ StablecoinThe Securities and Exchange Commission continues to attack Ripple after it announced its plans for a new stablecoin project. The Stablecoin, according to Brad Garlinghouse, is meant to fight against the de-pegging events that have caused stablecoin users to lose billions. Despite this noble reason, the SEC remains adamant and thinks the XRP issuer is in the business of issuing out unregistered securities, just like it’s been doing over the years. “Ripple’s primary business continues to be, as it has been since 2013, unregistered sales of XRP. It also plans to issue a new unregistered crypto asset,” the filing read.The XRP issuer has had minor wins against the SEC over the four-year court battle. As the legal warfare nears its end, despite the existing challenges. The SEC reportedly demanded a $2 billion fine from Ripple Labs; however, the defendant only offered $10 million. The SEC thinks that a significantly low amount for the XRP issuers’ alleged violations of the law.“That certainly could be part of the solution. I think there is a certain strangeness that the SEC has kind of picked winners here: it said that Bitcoin is not a security, it said that Ether is not a security, but really everything else, I think, is kind of at risk. Particularly given what they have done in the lawsuit against Ripple. But, you know, we could do that.”Brad Garlinghouse, Ripple CEOBrad said this in an interview with CNN, hinting a stablecoin solution might be the proper alternative to XRP amid SEC scrutiny. Unfortunately, the SEC has a similar view on the yet-to-launch stablecoin as well.

Dogecoin (DOGE) Valued at $25,000,000 Leaves Robinhood Crypto in the Wake of the SEC’s Wells Notice - The Daily Hodl


								Tens of millions of dollars worth of the meme asset Dogecoin (DOGE) has left Robinhood Crypto after the firm received a Wells Notice from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).
New data from blockchain-tracking platform Bitcoinsensus reveals that 164 million DOGE worth $25 million was transferred out of Robinhood after the firm’s crypto branch received notice that the regulatory agency would be taking enforcement actions against it.










A Well Notice is a warning given by the SEC informing an entity that legal action is going to be taken against them, though it is not an indication of any wrongdoing. Robinhood received its notice on May 6th.
Earlier this week, crypto attorney Jake Chervinsky said that the SEC was abusing its power and issuing Wells Notices as a scare tactic.
“If the SEC brings as many enforcement actions as it has sent Wells Notices, it will be in flagrant violation of both the law and its Congressional mandate. If not, it’s clearly abusing the Wells process to get free discovery and terrorize upstanding US companies. Which is it?”
However, Robinhood CEO Vlad Tenev took to social media after the firm received the notice, saying that he would challenge the SEC in court if it came down to it.
“While we strive to maintain positive and productive relationships with our regulators, if necessary we will use our resources to contest this matter in the courts, with the intent of both defending our crypto business and establishing regulatory clarity in the United States for the benefit of our customers.”
News of the transfer had minimal impact on DOGE as the digital asset is trading for $0.149 at time of writing, a fractional increase during the last 24 hours.

Bitcoin network challenges: Are miners behind BTC's decline? - AMBCrypto



Bitcoin’s difficulty is expected to decline in the coming days.
Price of BTC fell along with the velocity of the coin.

Bitcoin [BTC] has been struggling to push past the $65,000 level for quite some time. One of the main determinants of BTC’s price would be the state of miners on the Bitcoin network.
Difficulty declines
A drop of over 6% in Bitcoin mining difficulty is expected for BTC in the next 24 hours. This would be the largest difficulty decrease since FTX collapsed in December 2022, which saw a drop of over 7%.
At press time, blocks were coming in at an average time of 10.7 minutes. The recent difficulty drop is likely due to a decrease in the network’s hash rate, which is the total computing power dedicated to mining Bitcoin.
Source: X
The revenue generated by miners declined significantly as well over the past month, from $72,000 to $59,000.
This decline in revenue can have a severe impact on not only the Bitcoin network, but also BTC’s price.
As miner revenues decline, it gets harder for miners to remain profitable, so miners have to resort to selling their BTC so that they can stay afloat. As a result, selling pressure on BTC increases.
Source: Blockchain.com
State of the Bitcoin network
Another thing that can impact miner revenue and BTC’s price would be the activity on the Bitcoin network. At the time of writing, Daily Active Addresses on the Bitcoin network had declined significantly.
This slowdown in activity could signal a potential decline in interest in Bitcoin’s ecosystem, which may impact sentiment around the network in the long run.
Source: Santiment
At press time, BTC was trading at $61,655.60. Also, the velocity at which BTC was trading at had plummeted significantly in the last few days. 
A falling velocity implied that the frequency with which BTC was being traded at had declined.

Coinbase sees infinite interoperability potential with Ethereum and USDC

Coinbase is preparing for a future of a billion customers using decentralized applications on millions of blockchains safely and securely in a system integrating the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) and Circle’s USD Coin (USDC). Coinbase head of tokenization Anthony Bassili, speaking at TokenizeThis 2024 in Miami, said Coinbase’s Ethereum layer-2 Base blockchain will save time on Know Your Customer (KYC) and Anti-Money Laundering (AML) with identity attestation through the Ethereum Attestation service and Coinbase verification, which creates a tag on the user’s so-called smart wallet. Coinbase verification is available after the customer has completed its KYC procedure. While that may not be sufficient in all cases, Bassili said:“We expect that eventually to evolve into something like a KYC reliance model. […] And it will start to form market structure that makes it a lot easier for a simpler KYC process.” Already more than 300,000 wallets have been attested. Related: Coinbase's Base could make it the NVIDIA of DeFiTo give those customers with wallets and verified identities Web3 access, Base will leverage the interoperability of EVM networks. The ecosystem will be supported by USDC. Coinbase took an equity stake in Circle in August. “Right now, we're somewhere above $28 billion of total assets” in Circle, Bassili said. Coinbase also has the ability to mint USDC.Coinbase head of tokenization Anthony Bassili (right) at TokenizeThis 2024. Source: Sam Bourgi/CointelegraphWhen robust tokenized assets in different asset classes arise, it could become possible to trade assets for assets, without going through the intermediate step of trading them for dollars. Bassili said:“I think […] we're a while away from [that goal], because we need regulatory structures to show up, we need products themselves to be designed with identity checks instantly, and there is a lot of market structure that is still has to come.”“Crypto is the perfect embodiment of a liquid free open market structure where you can design any amount of complexity into it and have assets, trade with each other, don't have to be dollar pairs trade,” Bassili said. In the meantime, USDC provides a first step to developing that market structure.Magazine: 6 Questions for Kim Hamilton Duffy of Centre

On the other hand, Shiba Inu, the second-largest meme coin, has also experienced challenges despite a notable 104% surge year-to-date. SHIB’s price soared by over 4% in the last 24 hours.

Similarly, the newly emerging meme coin PEPE saw a remarkable surge of over 560% in the last 90 days. However, the recent market slump has led to a 22% drop over the past week, followed by an 11.26% increase in the last 24 hours. Despite this, PEPE is still the third-largest meme crypto, trading at an average price of $0.000008514. Its 24-hour trading volume has risen by 18% to $900 million, maintaining a market cap of $3.58 billion.

The process is simple: after purchasing a meal pack, customers can download the Bithumb app and enter a coupon code inside the box to potentially win 10,000 won worth of Bitcoin.An additional 20,000 won worth of Bitcoin will be awarded to those who choose to create a Bitcoin account with NH Nonghyup Bank.

Despite delays in IPO plans, the exchange recently announced its plans to become the first crypto exchange listed on the South Korean stock market.
Crypto Regulations in South Korea
Over the past few years, South Korea has implemented stricter crypto regulations surrounding the market. Legislators have also implemented stricter penalties for crypto-related crimes and established new regulatory guidelines. As of the fourth quarter of 2023, South Korean financial authorities mandate that cryptocurrency users report any unlicensed exchanges operating within the country.Despite these regulations, the collaboration between Emart24 and Bithumb demonstrates the continued growth and integration of cryptocurrency within South Korea’s economy.

Chiliz Joins Forces with SBI Holdings in Japan


SBI Digital Asset Holdings, a branch of SBI Holdings that focuses on cryptocurrencies, has joined forces with Chiliz, a top sports blockchain provider. 
Together, the two companies are launching a joint venture in Japan. It aimed to enhance the Japanese sports landscape by introducing fan tokens from globally celebrated football clubs like Manchester City and AC Milan.
SBI Holdings Teams Up with Chiliz 
This partnership extends beyond access to fan tokens. It offers a variety of interactive experiences and rewards, such as game-day activations. It also provides opportunities to influence club-related decisions. 
With 82 fan tokens and over 150 sports entity partnerships, Chiliz leverages its platform, Socios.com, to boost fan engagement significantly.

Fernando Luis Vázquez Cao, CEO of SBI Digital Asset, emphasized the venture’s capability to deliver new experiences tailored to Japan’s robust fan culture. 

“This partnership allows us to harness the passion of Japanese sports fans, bringing them closer to the teams they love through innovative Web3 features,” he noted.


Integrating fan tokens in Japan aligns with local cultural norms. Japanese investors often seek engagement and perks, not just financial gains. Therefore, fan tokens offer these without needing ownership in sports teams.
This venture has grown to include Azuro, a major player in on-chain predictions. Chiliz uses Azuro’s advanced liquidity pools, tools, and Oracle solutions to enter the on-chain prediction market. This move lets Azuro platform applications launch with low initial costs, focusing on user engagement and revenue.

Mastercard, Visa, Citi, JPMorgan and Other Giants Start Experiments for Cryptocurrency Technology - Here are the Details - Bitcoin Sistemi


Mastercard is collaborating with some of the largest U.S. banks to test a shared ledger technology that could revolutionize the settlement of tokenized assets such as commercial bank money, Treasuries, and investment-grade debt securities.
The Regulated Payment Network's proof-of-concept system in testing will simulate transactions in dollars, aiming to enable transactions across borders and systems, reduce errors and fraud, and make the process faster and easier.


Currently, securities such as commercial bank money, wholesale central bank money, and investment grade debt are all managed in separate systems. The introduction of this ledger technology can significantly change the financial landscape. Once these assets are tokenized and run on the distributed ledger, they can be traded on the same system.

This trial builds on a previous 12-week test that started in late 2022 and focused on domestic interbank payments in the US and cross-border payments in dollars.





Participants in the new trial include Citigroup Inc., JPMorgan Chase & Co., US Bancorp, Wells Fargo & Co., Visa Inc., Swift, TD Bank NA and Zions Bancorp.

Pantera Capital Predicts Bitcoin Price at $117,000 by 2025


Pantera Capital projects an astonishing ascent for Bitcoin, estimating its value at $117,000 by August 2025. 
This price prediction hinges on historical data surrounding Bitcoin halvings — a phenomenon that halves the reward for mining a block on the network.
Pantera Capital’s Bitcoin Price Prediction
In a recent report, Pantera Capital suggests that post-halving periods herald significant bull rallies. However, after the 2024 halving, Bitcoin suffered a price correction to $57,000. This pattern is typical of previous market cycles and predicts a potent bull run leading up to 2025.

In 2023, Bitcoin dipped to $28,168, yet it experienced a 1.8x increase by 2024. Pantera Capital extrapolates from this trend a robust 4.2x climb by late August 2025, just 480 days post-halving, culminating near a striking $117,482. Another optimistic prediction suggests Bitcoin might climb as high as $155,000 by the same year.
However, achieving these numbers requires overcoming substantial market resistance, particularly around $63,000. Pantera Capital points to Bitcoin’s current trajectory, which includes a “triple top pattern.” The analysts also foresee continued volatility as an indicator of the challenges ahead.


“A pattern has formed that we often call the triple top pattern. BTC/USD is currently experiencing a corrective recovery. However, breaking through the $63,000 resistance level remains a challenge and goal. The greatest volatility occurs after a breakout,” the report noted.

Nevertheless, the firm’s analysis remains steadfast, supported by successful past predictions, like when Bitcoin hit a market bottom of $17,000.

Bitcoin Whales Acquire Nearly $1 Billion BTC Amidst Price Stagnation ⋆ ZyCrypto

&nbsp

&nbsp
Bitcoin has shown remarkable resilience amidst a history of price fluctuations in recent weeks. Notably, on 14th March, Bitcoin surged as high as $71,827 ahead of the halving event. However, since the beginning of May, the leading crypto asset has faced a notable downturn, dropping to as low as $57,000 towards the end of last month.



Nevertheless, despite this volatility, Bitcoin appears to have entered a phase of relative stability. Its price hovers between $61,000 and $64,000, showing minimal volatility compared to its past erratic movements. This period of price stagnation hints at a temporary balance in the market, with neither bullish nor bearish sentiments dominating.



That said, while some investors interpret this as a precursor to a potential price swing, others see it as an opportunity for strategic accumulation. On Wednesday, popular crypto analytics platform Santiment highlighted how Bitcoin whales have made significant accumulation moves following the recent price dip.



“As Bitcoin ranges tightly between $61,000 and $64,000, large whales have made some accumulation moves over the past 24 hours. Wallets with 1,000-10,000 BTC have collectively accumulated $941 million worth of coins, rebounding to their highest holding level in 2 weeks,” tweeted Santiment.







Notably, Santiment’s late finding aligns with previous reports indicating a similar trend. On May 3, Santiment reported how Bitcoin whales accumulated over 47,000 BTC (over the past 24 hours), demonstrating resilience amidst market fluctuations. The consistent accumulation by large holders amidst market uncertainty underscores their confidence in Bitcoin’s long-term viability and resilience.

That said, indicators like the MVRV 90-Day Ratio technically suggest that Bitcoin remains in an attractive buy zone, further bolstering investor sentiment. Ki Young Ju, CEO of Cryptoquant, also chimed in on Bitcoin’s current state, highlighting Bitcoin’s robust network fundamentals and suggesting a potential market cap three times its current size.



“Bitcoin network fundamentals could support a market cap three times its current size compared to the last cyclical top, potentially sustaining a price of $265K,” wrote Ju.



Elsewhere, Glassnode analysts “Negentropic” also echoed optimism, suggesting that Bitcoin is primed for further upward movement. According to the experts, last week’s “reversal candle,” coupled with its movement back into the Pennant Structure, indicates a potential breakout.



“BTC still looks like it is about to BLOW higher! Last week’s candle was a Reversal Candle – a Hammer with a long Wick. Price moved back into the Pennant Structure. This candle still dominates the structure. This week’s pullback hence seems like healthy Correction before higher. Correction often pulls back either 50% or 61.8% of the previous Impulse move.” They wrote on Thursday. 







Bitcoin was trading at $62,623 at press time, reflecting a 1.85% surge over the past 24 hours.

Crypto Presidential Rally: TRUMP Soars 36.2% And Flips BODEN


																In a year full of global elections, the crypto industry remains expectant and critical of every candidate’s stance on cryptocurrencies. The US presidential elections could pose a turning point for regulations and adoption that could affect the industry worldwide. 
On Wednesday, Donald Trump, former US president and Republican candidate, stated his support for the industry and criticized Biden’s administration for its stance on digital assets. MAGA (TRUMP), the Trump-inspired memecoin, saw its price skyrocket  63% in the following hours.

Trump’s Stance On Crypto 
The Republican candidate held a gathering on Wednesday at his Mar-a-Lago resort in Palm Beach, Florida. Holders of NFTs bearing Trump’s name and likeness attended the Trump Cards NFT Gala. 
During this event, the former US president strongly criticized Biden’s administration and its hostility towards the sector. He revealed he is “fine” with crypto and wants to make it a “solid” industry.
Trump claimed he’s the best option for those who are in favor of cryptocurrencies:

(…) I’m fine with it. I want to make sure it’s good and solid and everything else. But I’m good with it. And if you want, if you like crypto in any form, and it comes in a lot of different forms, if you’re in favor of crypto, you better vote for me.

Moreover, the Republican candidate asserted that “crypto is moving out of the US because of the hostility towards it,” something he alleges he doesn’t want to continue and promises to stop.


When asked what he would do to stop the exodus of digital asset businesses, he stated that to embrace them, they would have to let them be in the country. To achieve this, the candidate promised a more welcoming regulatory framework for crypto. 
As part of his jab at the current administration, Trump mimicked US President Joe Biden, claiming he would be clueless if asked about cryptocurrencies. He further added, “The Democrats are very much against it.”
TRUMP Flips BODEN As Price Soars 
After Trump’s declarations, two memecoins inspired by the politicians saw a price reaction. Jeo Boden (BODEN) soared 23.5% in the following hour, going from $0.34 to $0.42. 
Since then, the price has retraced to hover between the $0.35-$0.36 range. BODEN is trading at $0.3492, representing a 15.1% increase in the last 24 hours. 
The token’s daily trading volume also saw a significant 35.7% surge, with over $20 million traded in the past day. Despite benefiting from the Republican candidate’s jab at its inspiration, BODEN Still displays red numbers in the longer timeframes, with a 29.9% and 59.8%  weekly and monthly decrease.


As a result, TRUMP’s $252 million market capitalization flipped BODEN’s $239 million. The Trump-inspired token became the 14th largest memecoin by market capitalization, per CoinGecko data.

TRUMP trades at $5.43 at the time of writing, representing a 36.2% increase in the last 24 hours.

Diving into Bitcoin whale activity: 15K BTC snapped up in 2 days - AMBCrypto



A cohort of BTC whales have continued to fill their bags.
This has happened despite the coin’s recent price action.

Bitcoin [BTC] whales have intensified accumulation despite the coin’s recent decline below $62,000. 
According to on-chain data provider Santiment, BTC whales holding between 1000 and 10,000 coins accumulated 15,121 BTC valued at $930 million between the 7th and the 8th of May.
 This pushed the cohort’s total BTC holding to its highest level in 14 days.


At press time, this group of BTC investors held 38% of the coin’s circulating supply of 20 million BTC. 
BTC has the bears to contend with
At press time, BTC exchanged hands at $61,621. The coin recently crossed below its 20-day simple moving average (SMA), putting it at risk of a further decline in the short term. 
When an asset’s price falls below its 20-day SMA, it suggests that the short-term trend for the asset is downward. 
Market participants often view this as a sign that sellers are in control and that the asset’s price will likely continue declining.
Readings from BTC’s price movement on a 1-day chart showed that its price fell below its 20-day SMA on the 7th of May and has since witnessed a 3% decline in its value.
Further, the coin has seen a decline in demand among general market participants. An assessment of its key momentum indicators showed them below their respective center lines at press time.
For example, the coin’s Relative Strength Index (RSI) was 44.12, while its Money Flow Index (MFI) was 23.21. At these values, the indicators showed significant bearish pressure in the market.
Likewise, as of this writing, the coin’s Chaikin Money Flow (CMF) was poised to cross below the zero line. This indicator measures the money flow into and out of the coin’s market. 
A CMF value below zero indicates market weakness, suggesting increased liquidity exit.

If the bears strengthen their position, they may pull the coin’s price down to the support line of BTC’s descending channel pattern.

 If this happens, the leading cryptocurrency asset will exchange hands at the $57,000 price region. 
However, if this bearish projection is invalidated as bullish activity gains momentum, BTC’s price may rally toward the pattern’s resistance line and attempt a crossover.

CZ hits back at WSJ, Hong Kong crypto ETF’s take ‘$50B equivalent’: Asia Express


            
Our weekly roundup of news from East Asia curates the industry’s most important developments.



Binance is under scrutiny yet again 



Cryptocurrency exchange Binance has been accused of firing its own investigators after discovering that its VIP client, props trading firm DWF Labs, engaged in alleged acts of market manipulation. 



A May 9 Wall Street Journal report claimed that DWF Labs engaged in market manipulation, wash trading, and inflated trading volumes amounting to $300 million through deals with crypto projects. After the exchange’s surveillance team recommended offboarding the client, Binance allegedly sided with DWF Labs and fired the investigator, arguing insufficient evidence for the claim.

Binance has denied involvement. “We affirm our strict market surveillance program. We do not tolerate market abuse,” said the exchange in a tweet. “Market maker competition is fierce and our investigation team’s job is to be neutral and look at the evidence without any bias, including bias that might come from market-making firms’ claims against their competitors.”  



According to the exchange, its staff has offboarded 355,000 users with a transaction volume of $2.5 trillion for violating its terms of use in the past three years. 



DWF Labs, too, has denied the allegations. “We want to clarify that many recent allegations reported in the press are unfounded and distort the facts,” they said. “DWF Labs operates with the highest standards of integrity, transparency, and ethics, and we remain committed to supporting you and our over 700 partners across the crypto ecosystem.”



Binance’s co-founder and spouse of its co-founder and former CEO Changpeng Zhao, penned a response dripping in irony, writing: 




“I am very grateful to the WSJ for their consistent and long-term devotion to Binance, which has greatly increased our exposure and saved us a lot of marketing budget. However, I have noticed an interesting phenomenon where some mainstream media articles are increasingly driven by emotions and biases rather than facts. For example, the complaints of former employees can become the basis of an article, while Binance’s proactive assistance to law enforcement agencies in investigating and apprehending the mastermind behind Zkasino (as a matter of fact) is not deemed worthy of reporting.” 




DWF Labs is a prominent trading firm in the crypto industry. Founded by Andrei Grachev in 2021, the firm invests in promising projects and provides long-term financial support to them, as stated on its website. 






Thailand Web3 Music Festival concludes 



Music idol protocol Fansland’s music festival in Bangkok, Thailand attracted over 30,000 festival go-ers from May 4 to 5. 



The Web3 aspect was perhaps of less appeal than a performance by South Korean pop star PSY, the creator of “Gangnam Style.” More than 20 other artists graced the stage, including renowned Cantonese Hip-Hop artist Edison Chen, powerhouse vocalists Henry Lau, Gen1es, BKPP, Chanyeol, BUS, Dreamnote, Pretzelle, Sistar19, Taemin, and 24kGoldn. “Their electrifying performances set the stage ablaze, creating an atmosphere of pure excitement and energy that left the audience in awe,” organizers breathlessly reported. 







In addition to human performances, the festival featured tokenized music products and AI-generated music idols. 



The festival featured a unique NFT ticketing system where tickets were minted as NFTs on Fansland and became tradable on secondary markets. The tickets can also be used as an access point to interact with Fansland DeFi. 



The first batch of NFT ticket holders for this music festival automatically became early participants in Fansland.AI, unlocking perks such as token airdrops and future whitelist qualifications. 



Fansland aims to create a decentralized fan economy infrastructure so that global music lovers can interact with their singers and idols. It focuses on Web3 music festivals, NFT ticketing, and real-world asset DeFi. Last month, Fansland secured a $10 million funding round led by IME, Linear Capital, and Falablock.

Hong Kong ETFs attract $317M, but can it last?



The total assets under management of six Hong Kong spot Bitcoin and Ether ETFs have surpassed $317.4 million since their inception on April 30. 



Data from local crypto exchange OSL, which also serves as the trading platform and sub-custodian for a few of the aforementioned ETFs, show that a combined 2,079.42 Bitcoin (BTC) and 396.79 Ether (ETH) have flowed in. 



“Together, we have addressed some of the most intricate challenges of our industry —regulated digital asset custody, ensuring stable liquidity, and bridging traditional financial markets with the speed of on/off-chain operations,” commented Patrick Pan, CEO of OSL. 



The Hong Kong spot crypto ETFs are denominated in three fiat currencies and allow investors to subscribe and redeem ETF units in both crypto and fiat. However, it appears that the vast majority of assets managed by the ETFs — well over $200 million, were subscribed prior to their listing. 



As per data compiled by Farside Investors, total asset flow into the six ETFs has amounted to just $24.7 million since April 30, a mere fraction of the tens of billions of dollars that went into U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs in their first week of launch. 



Nevertheless, many industry veterans remain optimistic



“The HK ETFs at $310m is equiv to $50b in US market,” said senior Bloomberg ETF analyst Eric Balchunas on April 6, in reference to the Hong Kong market’s relative size and liquidity compared to the United States. “So in that regard these ETFs already as big to their local mkt as US ones are to its.”



ApolloSats co-founder Thomas Fahrer claimed “rumors are swirling of a pending approval into Hong Kong Stock Connect which would allow Mainland Chinese to invest and could ignite this market.” However these are merely rumors and mainland Chinese investors are currently prohibited from accessing the Hong Kong crypto ETFs, barring a population of over 1 billion from entering the space. 



Despite high hopes, the Hong Kong crypto ETFs did not attract as many assets as expected. 



$128 million pledged for Hong Kong crypto ETF liquidity fund 



Market makers remain bullish on the prospects of the Hong Kong ETFs. 



On May 8, digital asset managers LD Capital, Antalpha Ventures, and Highblock pledged a total of $128 million “to provide market-making services to Hong Kong ETFs, aimed at enhancing liquidity, improving the efficiency of capital flows, and reducing the risks associated with liquidity fluctuations and transactional volatility.”



LD Capital is a digital asset fund with a focus on primary and secondary blockchain investments, with over 300 blockchain enterprises in its portfolio. Antalpha Ventures is a financial services platform affiliated with Bitmain, a major manufacturer of Bitcoin mining ASICs. 



Highblock Limited, which was established by former executives from major international digital asset trading platforms, has more than ten years of experience in blockchain quantitative trading. The company is licensed for digital asset quantitative trading in Hong Kong and provides quantitative trading and investment portfolio management services in the digital asset sector.



The liquidity addition may be significant as due to liquidity restraints in the Hong Kong market and ongoing market downturn in China, the six spot crypto ETFs only saw trading volume of around $100 million on day one.

                        To commemorate the 25th anniversary of His Majesty Otumfuo Osei Tutu II’s reign, Ghana Post launched a collection of “Crypto stamps” linked to non-fungible tokens (NFTs) on May 9. The initiative blends Ghanaian cultural heritage with cutting-edge blockchain technology, offering a unique way to celebrate the King’s Silver Jubilee.
Ghana NFT Stamps: Bridging Tradition and Technology
These limited-edition Ghana Crypto Stamps, priced at $18 (250 Ghanaian cedi) each, are linked to unique NFTs, verifiable on the blockchain, providing collectors with proof of ownership and authenticity. Only 7,200 Crypto Stamps are available, making them potentially valuable collectible for collectors and technology enthusiasts.The integration of NFTs ensures the security and transparency of the Ghana crypto stamp collection. By using blockchain technology, collectors can verify the authenticity of their stamps through a simple smartphone scan, generating a unique authentication message for each scan. This process effectively combats counterfeiting and safeguards the integrity of each collectible.With the release of these NFTs, Ghana has become the first African country to release a commemorative stamp collection on the blockchain.
African Adoption of Cryptocurrency
Ghana’s foray into NFT stamps reflects a growing adoption of cryptocurrency and blockchain technology across Africa.The South African Reserve Bank recently announced plans to regulate and integrate cryptocurrency and central bank digital currency (CBDC) into its financial system. This initiative seeks to modernize payment infrastructure, enhance access to financial technology, and ultimately benefit the local economy. While the South African plan focuses on the domestic market, it underscores the continent’s increasing openness to embracing digital currencies.

                        Grayscale, the company behind the world’s largest Bitcoin (BTC) ETF, saw flat revenues in Q1 despite non-stop outflows from its world-famous fund throughout the quarter.
Grayscale’s Bitcoin: Outflows VS Revenue
Per a shareholder letter from Grayscale’s parent company Digital Currency Group (DCG), the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) netted $156 million between January and March – nearly identical to its Q4 2023 figure.As usual, this comprised most of DCG’s total $229 million revenue, up 11% from the prior quarter. The conglomerate’s gains were primarily driven by its mining pool giant Foundry and investment platform Luno, up 35% and 46% respectively.
“While Grayscale expected outflows alongside increased competition under the ETF wrapper, Q1 revenue attributable to GBTC nevertheless exceeded our expectations,” read the shareholder letter.
Upon converting into a Bitcoin spot ETF on January 11, GBTC lowered its long-standing management fee from 2% to 1.5%, following through on a promise to cut charges for critical investors who often labeled the fund as “exploitative.”However, most of Grayscale’s competitors who launched alongside them that day sported ultra-low fees of 0.3% or lower, including funds launched by recognizable names like BlackRock and Fidelity.As such, new and prospective Bitcoin ETF buyers had no incentive to invest through Grayscale, leaving little to no demand/inflows to counterbalance regular outflows from the fund.Such outflows have been seismic, to be sure: the fund now only controls 291,790 BTC, less than the 619,000 BTC it held as of January 10.As explained by market analysts at Glassnode, Grayscale’s investor base mostly represents long-term holders who have chosen to sell their Bitcoin at a profit as the asset’s price climbed.Last week, the fund experienced its first net inflow day since January 11.Losing Bitcoin ETF Market Share
That said, thanks to the value of its existing BTC rising over the past quarter, the company’s assets under management (AUM) has suffered less, falling from $30 billion to $18 billion.BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) has nearly caught up to GBTC in size, controlling 273,25 BTC as of May 8, according to on-chain data.On a yearly basis, DCG’s revenue rose 51% compared to Q1 2023. Meanwhile, Bitcoin’s price has risen 125% since this time last year.Regulators are currently reviewing an application for Grayscale to launch an Ether (ETH) spot ETF, though analysts don’t like their odds of approval. The company recently rescinded its application to launch an Ether futures ETF.

Binance Fined $4.3M in Canada as Global Regulators Circle - DailyCoin


        
Binance has been slapped with a multi-million dollar fine in Canada.



The fine comes about a year after the firm left the jurisdiction.



The firm is also under scrutiny in several other jurisdictions.
Binance, the world’s largest crypto exchange by market capitalization, can not seem to catch a break.The crypto exchange’s years of operating in the gray area and eschewing traditional corporate practices appear to be catching up with it. In November 2023, the exchange was slapped with $4.3 billion in fines from the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ)  for money laundering violations.
Now, the firm has been slapped with another fine, this time in Canada for similar violations.Binance Slapped With $4.3M FineIn a press statement on Thursday, May 7, the Financial Transactions and Reports Analysis Centre of Canada (FINTRAC) disclosed that it had imposed an “administrative monetary penalty” of $6 million CAD or about $4.3 million USD on Binance for failing to comply with anti-money laundering and counter-terrorism financing rules.According to the regulator, the crypto exchange failed to report transactions over $10,000 on the exchange. The fine comes nearly a year after the exchange disclosed that it was closing shop in the country, citing restrictive regulations related to “stablecoins and investor limits.”A Global Noose Tightening?Beyond the U.S. and Canada, Binance faces significant regulatory scrutiny in several other jurisdictions, including the Philippines and Nigeria. Regulators have moved to block the exchange’s online presence in the Philippines.
In Nigeria, the firm faces charges of money laundering and tax evasion. The situation in Nigeria is further complicated by the arrest of the exchange’s Chief Financial Crime Compliance Officer, Tigran Gambaryan. The American has been held in the country for over two months and named in the charges against the exchange.On the Flipside 
Despite its several regulatory challenges, Binance is still the largest crypto exchange in the world.



Binance CEO Richard Teng has committed to steering the firm down the regulatory-compliant path.
Why This Matters The recent fine Binance faces adds to the exchange’s growing regulatory troubles. At the same time, it is another signal of shifting industry dynamics compelling crypto exchanges to comply with regulations in their jurisdictions.Read this for more on Binance’s history with Canada:Binance Canada Exit Leaves Crypto Community SplitFollow Ethereum’s latest effort to improve wallet UX:How Ethereum EIP-7702 Boosts Wallet UX with Minimal Downsides

Shiba Inu Team Issues Critical Warning To SHIB Community Following Major Listing | Bitcoinist.com


								The Shiba Inu team has issued a crucial warning to its community, alerting them to the presence of fraudulent groups seeking to exploit the trust of SHIB community members for personal gain. This cautionary message from the team arrives as the cryptocurrency scored another significant listing milestone.
SHIB Team Cautions Against Scams
The Shiba Inu team has advocated for heightened vigilance against scams targeting community members. In a recent X (formerly Twitter) post, Shibarmy Scam Alerts, a social media handle dedicated to exposing scams, issued a stern warning regarding multiple scam attempts observed on Telegram social media platform.
The scam tracker has urged community members to watch out for fake or fraudulent groups impersonating legitimate Shiba Inu channels on Telegram. They disclosed tactics employed by these deceptive channels, including “promising giveaways, exclusive content, investment opportunities, and offering assistance for transaction issues to deceive unsuspecting community members.  
Excluding Telegram, the Shiba Inu community has also seen a rise in scam activities via X, with numerous scammers targeting community members using similar impersonation tactics or phishing attacks. 
While informing Shiba Inu members of these latest scam attacks on the community, Shibarmy Scam Alerts also outlined various ways SHIB community members can protect their privacy and security. The SHIB tracker emphasized the importance of verifying the authenticity of Telegram groups by checking for verification badges and announcements from reputable sources. 
Furthermore, the team stressed the significance of avoiding suspicious links and refraining from sharing wallet addresses in public chat rooms to reduce the likelihood of becoming a primary target for malicious attackers. Finally, Shibarmy Scam Alerts has urged users to stay updated on security alerts and adhere to optimal security practices, such as reporting any suspicious scam activities to the relevant authorities.  
Shiba Inu Gets Listed By Crypto Exchange Nexo
Amidst efforts to combat scam attempts within the Shiba Inu community, the cryptocurrency is celebrating a new milestone, securing listings from major exchanges. Nexo, a Switzerland-based all-in-one crypto platform, announced in a post on X on May 7, that it has officially integrated Shiba Inu into its crypto offerings. 
In its post, the crypto exchange lauded SHIB’s impressive growth over the years, highlighting the important role the Shiba Inu community, including its developer and dedicated supporters, has taken in boosting the development of the SHIB ecosystem. 
This listing also comes as Shiba Inu’s demand in the broader crypto market is growing at a rapid pace. Including Nexo, over 50 other crypto platforms or exchanges have listed SHIB, such as Binance, Robinhood, Bitget, and recently, Bitcoin.com.au.

Crypto influencers become 'PokÃ©mon cards' on Blast game - Crypto Briefing




Influencers from the crypto community on X were turned into a trading card game by the Blast-based game Fantasy.top. In the past four days, the cards related to these influencers reached 9,518 Ether (ETH) in trading volume, according to a Flipside dashboard created by user Hildobby.The cards’ power level is defined by how regularly the influencers publish with their X account, their follower count, and the reach of their tweets. Moreover, the more an influencer card is used by players, the more they receive from Fantasy.top. The power levels are based on the last seven days.Image: Fantasy.topFantasy.top leverages the current narrative of social finance, or SocialFi, which is hot after Friend.tech launched its native token FRIEND. FRIEND launched at an initial price of $3.03 but fell sharply in just three hours to $0.89. However, the token made a significant recovery to $2.19 at the time of writing.A crypto researcher known as DeFi Edge explained in his newsletter that Fantasy.top is better than Friend.tech at aligning the interests of users, influencers, and the protocol itself.“Influencers will get a share of revenue from: users/card traders want to buy cards from their favorite influencers; influencers are intrinsically motivated to improve their X engagement; this boosts their points, so users and influencers are perfectly aligned; the platform is giving money to influencers whose cards are used in competitions, so influencers are happy; the protocol wants more traders and influencers on their platform, so they’ll keep shipping features to make Fantasy.top more attractive.”Influencers receive 1.5% of all the fees collected from the trading volume of their respective cards, and also a 10% cut on pack sales which is split between the cards discovered. Packs are like boosters found in traditional trading card games, where a user gets random cards by opening them. At the time of writing, the platform’s marketplace generated 285.5 ETH in fees, equivalent to $863,000.The Fantasy.top platform is only accessible with referral codes, and it doesn’t have a native token yet.

Ethereum Whale Makes Massive Bet on ETH After 20% Price Drop | Cryptoglobe


                                
An Ethereum whale has made a massive bet on the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization after withdrawing funds from leading cryptocurrency exchange Binance and staking them, to then borrow with those holdings and buy more.



According to data first shared by on-chain analysis service Lookonchain the Ethereum whale withdrew 6,030 ETH tokens worth over $18 million from leading cryptocurrency exchange Binance as it kept on accumulating funds since the beginning of the month, to the point they managed to have 10,758 ETH worth over $32.14 million in their wallet.



The whale then swapped their ETH for Lido Staked ETH (stETH), a liquid derivative token representing Ether that’s staked on Lido, a decentralized liquid staking protocol. The tokens represent ETH that’s earning from validating transactions on the network, while being liquid to use on other decentralized finance protocols.



The whale then deposited the stETH into decentralized lending protocol Aave to borrow $28.5 million in stablecoins, which it then used to buy more ETH, effectively leveraging their position on the second-largest cryptocurrency.











            
            

            
            

            
            

        

The whale’s bet on ETH comes after the cryptocurrency lost nearly 20% of its value over the last 30-day period to now trade below the $3,000 mark, while still being up around 30% year-to-date.



As CryptoGlobe reported a major ETH whale has recently cashed in on a successful year, as after purchasing a significant amount of ETH at around $1,890 per token, the whale started taking profit.



The whale first withdrew 12,906 ETH, valued at roughly $24.39 million at the time, from the leading cryptocurrency exchange Binance. The tokens were then deposited into Lido, before the whale withdrew 7,000 ETH from it and redeposited the funds on Binance to sell them.

                        The Ethereum (ETH) price is swinging either side of the $3,000 level as traders monitor a spike in whale purchases and ask whether the cryptocurrency could soon be set for a rebound.On-chain-focused analytics X account @lookonchain reported on Wednesday that a whale recently accumulated $32.14 million in ETH.These tokens were withdrawn from Binance, before being sent to Aave to borrow $28.5 million in stablecoins.These stablecoins were then promptly used to buy more Ethereum.Increased buying activity from whales is almost always taken as a good sign for a cryptocurrency.Whales are often looked at as smart money that might have some market insight the rest of us don’t.Ether bulls will be hoping that accumulation from this whale marks the bottom of ETH’s recent dip.The Ethereum price, last at $3,020, is down 26% versus its early March highs.The Ethereum price has pulled 26% lower versus its March highs. Source: TradingViewEthereum Underperforming Bitcoin – Here’s Why
The downturn in the Ethereum price since March is mostly a result of broader market conditions turning less bullish.After hitting record highs above $73,000 in March on ETF demand optimism, easing ETF flows and macro headwinds have forced Bitcoin lower to the $62,000s.However, where Bitcoin is currently down around 15% versus its March peak, Ethereum’s pullback has been harsher.That can partially be explained by the fact that Ether is generally a higher beta asset versus Bitcoin. That’s to say, its likely to perform relatively better in times of risk-on and relatively worse in times of risk-off.But its also likely due to the pricing out of optimism that spot Ethereum ETFs will soon gain approval.The SEC is widely expected to reject these ETF applications this month as it probes crypto firms for evidence that Ethereum might be a security.However, given these rejections are now widely expected, this is unlikely to have much market impact.
Ethereum Price Prediction – Where Next for ETH?
While whale activity has some hoping the Ethereum price could soon rebound, technical analysis suggests the outlook remains fragile.The Ethereum price remains locked within a downward trend channel that has been in play since March.It has also broken to its 50 and 100DMAs. A recovery to the $3,200 area is plausible, but this is a very strong area of resistance.With the next leg of the crypto market rally unlikely to take hold anytime soon, Ether could continue to struggle.While whale activity has some hoping the Ethereum price could soon rebound, technical analysis suggests the outlook remains fragile. Source: TradingViewA test of support at $2,700 in the coming weeks is very plausible, especially if Bitcoin dips back under $60,000.This is roughly in line with where the 200DMA resides and so should be a strong zone of support.
Ether Turns Inflationary as Ethereum Fees Drop 
The recent Dencun upgrade has reduced Ethereum fees by as much as 4x, according to CryptoQuant data.That has substantially reduced the cryptocurrency’s burn rate, with the Ether supply recently turning inflationary as a result.This has concerned some ETH traders. Many see continued ETH deflation as a key value proposition for holding the cryptocurrency.However, these traders must remember the chilling impact that high fees has on Ethereum’s adoption.If Ethereum is going to retain its spot as the dominant smart-contract-enabled blockchain in web3, lowering fees is key.After all, why would everyday users choose to transact on Ethereum if fees are 100x higher than on other chains.
ETH Alternative to Consider – Mega Dice (DICE)
Crypto investors looking for investments with greater upside potential than ETH should check out presale investing.Web3 projects and protocols often sell their native tokens at a discount to early investors to raise funds for development.If presale investors can find a good project that gains traction in the market, they can book exponential gains.One project that analysts at Cryptonews are a big fan of is Mega Dice Casino.This already well-established crypto casino has launched a presale of its utility token, DICE.DICE holders get big cashback benefits on their wagers and can generate passive income via DICE staking.The crypto casino is also running a $750,000 airdrop to reward early presale investors.The project has already raised $870,000. Potential investors may want to move quickly, as the DICE price will rise when the $1 million milestone is hit.Check Out Mega Dice Casino’s Presale

Bitcoin Mining Difficulty Is Plummeting-Here’s Why - Decrypt

We do the research, you get the alpha!Get exclusive reports and access to key insights on airdrops, NFTs, and more! Subscribe now to Alpha Reports and up your game!Go to Alpha ReportsBitcoin just got much easier to mine—should we be worried? Data from BTC.com shows that Bitcoin mining difficulty plunged nearly 6% to 83.1 trillion hashes yesterday. The higher the mining difficulty—measured through the energy and resources that miners use to keep the network secure—the more difficult Bitcoin is to attack.A drop in difficulty, therefore, isn’t a good sign. But it’s expected, at least in the short term, experts told Decrypt.“If there isn’t enough margin for miners to make a profit, they turn off, which causes the hash rate to go down,” Luxor mining pool CEO Nick Hansen told Decrypt.“Hash rate” refers to the speed at which a miner produces hashes—the process of encrypting data. This model is known as proof-of-work, a key differentiator for Bitcoin. Bitcoin last month underwent a quadrennial event called the halving. The update cut miner rewards in half from 6.25 BTC for each block they process to 3.125 BTC. Miners—who produce new coins and keep the network ticking along by processing new transactions—now have to work harder to stay in the game. And with smaller rewards but harder work, a lot of miners are closing up shop altogether. Nishant Sharma, founder at BlocksBridge Consulting—a research and communications strategy firm dedicated to the Bitcoin mining industry—said that this is what usually happens after a halving. “After a Bitcoin halving, the drop in mining rewards leads less efficient miners to unplug their machines,” he said. “This self-adjusting feature favors leaner operations, as remaining miners receive increased rewards due to the reduced difficulty,” said Sharma.Scott Norris, CEO of mining firm Optiminer, concurred: “This is a normal occurrence after a halving event and healthy for the network and the well positioned miners,” he said.“The miners who planned properly will grow or the ones who turned off will get newer tech and find cheaper energy while everyone waits for the price to reflect the halving,” Norris added. “Either way, the network will continue to grow.”The price of Bitcoin is also playing a part in the drop in mining difficulty: the asset touched a new all-time high of $73,737 last month but today stands at $62,506, a drop of 15%, according to CoinGecko. If the asset were priced higher, mining the asset would be more profitable, rewards for miners would be higher and more would be able to stay in business. But a declining BTC price makes this more difficult, compounding the effects of the halving.Still, Norris says this isn't a surprise—and neither is the lull in the market.“It always happens this way,” said Norris. “Historically, it’ll be late in the year before we see much price rise [for Bitcoin].”Stay on top of crypto news, get daily updates in your inbox.

Bitcoin (BTC) on Verge of Losing $60,000, Is Shiba Inu (SHIB) Ready for It? Solana (SOL) Forms Reversal Pattern

Bitcoin is currently on the brink of dropping below the $60,000 level, a significant psychological and technical level for the cryptocurrency. As observed on the chart, a descending trendline is clearly applying downward pressure, guiding Bitcoin into forming lower lows. This pattern suggests that the downward momentum might continue in the near term.The current market dynamics show Bitcoin's price being squeezed by this descending trendline. Every attempt to push upwards meets resistance, leading to lower highs — a classic indicator of a continuing downtrend. Notably, the volume of trades has been decreasing, which typically indicates a weakening of the current trend and potentially sets the stage for a trend reversal. However, the current signals suggest that the market is not yet ready to reverse to being bullish.BTC/USD Chart by TradingViewAdding to the complexity of the movements is the potential formation of a higher low, which could be the first sign of an impending shift in trend. This is a critical observation as it could signify that although the overarching trend is bearish, there is some buying interest at lower levels that prevents further drops, providing a temporary floor for Bitcoin's price.The immediate future of Bitcoin's price largely depends on its interaction with the trendline and key moving averages. Currently, the 50-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA) sits around $65,000, acting as potential upper resistance in case of any bullish reversal.Shiba Inu hits thresholdShiba Inu is currently navigating a critical phase as it hovers around a strong support level at approximately 0.00002260.The current chart formation presents a descending triangle pattern, a typical bearish signal in technical analysis, suggesting that SHIB could be under significant selling pressure. This pattern is forming just as SHIB tests its support, making the 0.00002260 level crucial for determining its short-term trajectory. A break below this could lead to a test of the next major support at the 0.00002100 level, aligning closely with the 100-day EMA. It often acts as a dynamic support in downtrends, providing a potential rebound zone for the price.Conversely, the immediate resistance is located around 0.00002400. Overcoming this level could invalidate the bearish pattern and possibly trigger a short-term bullish reversal. However, the convergence of the EMAs above this price point may complicate any upward movements, potentially capping gains and adding to the volatility.Given these dynamics, the situation with Shiba Inu remains highly uncertain. The descending triangle, combined with the convergence of moving averages and key support and resistance levels, suggests that SHIB could experience increased volatility in the near future. This unpredictability makes it a risky asset for traders and investors at this time.Is Solana aiming at reversal?Solana is currently showing signs of a potential reversal pattern. As it approaches the 100-day EMA we might see a reversal. However, it is important to note that this EMA has not been tested before, which brings a degree of uncertainty about its reliability as a support.The current price movement has brought SOL closer to what might be seen as a critical juncture. The nearest solid support level is established around $128, but this level has already been breached once, adding to the unpredictability of its strength in holding future dips. Such breaches can undermine confidence in the support level, suggesting that it may not be as robust as hoped.Despite these concerns, there are positive signs in the market dynamics. The descending volume indicates that selling pressure is diminishing, which could mean that sellers are getting exhausted. This scenario typically sets the stage for buyers to regain control and potentially drive the price upwards. However, the volume profile does not support the formation of an inverse Head and Shoulders pattern, a common bullish reversal indicator, casting some doubts on the immediacy of a bullish turnaround.In the midterm, if buyers can capitalize on the reduced selling pressure, there is a chance for Solana to make significant gains.

$300M Scandal Rocks Binance: Fired Investigators Accuse DWF Labs Of Manipulative Trading | Bitcoinist.com


								Binance, one of the world’s largest cryptocurrency exchanges, has come under scrutiny after a Wall Street Journal report revealed that the platform fired its top investigators following their allegations of wash trading involving a top VIP client, DWF Labs. 
Binance Refutes Wash Trading Allegations
The report alleges that DWF Labs conducted over $300 million in wash trades across seven tokens in 2023, manipulating the price of Yield Guild Games’ native token, YGG and other cryptocurrencies. 
However, Binance has refuted the allegations, stating that the transactions were proprietary and did not constitute manipulation. The exchange also accused the head of the monitoring team of collaboration with DWF’s competitors, leading to his termination.

In response to the Wall Street Journal report, Binance affirmed its strict market surveillance program and commitment to combating market abuse. The exchange stated that it does not tolerate such practices and has offboarded nearly 355,000 users with a transaction volume of over $2.5 trillion for violating its terms of use in the past three years. 
Binance emphasized the importance of maintaining “neutrality and unbiased investigation”, even in the face of claims made by market-making firms against their competitors. The exchange aims to ensure healthy competition in the industry and protect users from market manipulation.
DWF Labs Strongly Denies Accusations
Binance heavily relies on VIP customers, who contribute two-thirds of the platform’s total trading volume. The report highlights a similar incident involving the Tron Foundation last summer, which Binance investigated. In response to the WSJ report on DWF, Binance co-founder He Yi said:  
We have been monitoring the MM market and we are very strict. We do not target any fund; There is competition among MMs, and the means are very shady. You can buy PR as you like, but don’t get close to me. We will ensure our own fairness and not participate, but we will also report truthfully to the monitor and other regulatory authorities.
DWF Labs, the VIP client accused of wash trading, has responded to the allegations, asserting that they operate with the highest integrity, transparency, and ethics standards. 
The company stated that the recent allegations reported in the press are “unfounded and distort the facts.” DWF Labs remains committed to supporting its partners across the crypto ecosystem and vows to report all relevant situations to regulatory authorities truthfully.

In sum, the firing of Binance’s top investigators after they alleged wash trading by VIP client DWF Labs has raised concerns about market manipulation and the exchange’s handling of such incidents. 
Binance maintains that the transactions in question were proprietary and not manipulative while accusing the head of the monitoring team of collaboration with DWF’s competitors. 
As the investigation unfolds, the cryptocurrency industry will closely watch how Binance addresses these allegations and upholds its commitment to market surveillance and user protection.

Base set for ‘material share’ of SocialFi activity: Franklin Templeton

Trillion-dollar asset manager Franklin Templeton suggests “Base Season” has arrived with the rise of Social Finance (SocialFi) apps, with Base leading other Ethereum layer 2s in the vertical. “[It is] positioning itself well to capture a material share of SocialFi activity and remain a leader in the Ethereum L2 sector going forward,” Franklin Templeton said in a May report.About 46% of transactions related to SocialFi are on Base, which has increasingly stripped market share away from the BNB Chain and Polygon in recent months, according to one of the charts provided by Franklin Templeton.Franklin Templeton said support from Coinbase has played a key role in Base capturing nearly half of the SocialFi market share to date.Friend.tech is perhaps the most notable SocialFi application built on Base, which allows creators to connect and monetize their content through “key” shares or “tokenized attention.”“Base has hit a homerun in the world of SocialFi,” which will remain a “key vertical to watch” for Base’s adoption and growth over the long haul, Franklin Templeton said.Source: Franklin TempletonTheta Network, Decentralized Social, Fantasy.top and Steem are among the other popular SocialFi blockchains and protocols. Franklin Templeton highlighted the recent memecoin mania as another key contributor to Base’s rise in network activity. Related: Coinbase sees infinite interoperability potential with Ethereum and USDCBase is the third largest Ethereum layer 2 network by total value locked now with $5.4 billion, only trailing Arbitrum One and OP Mainnet at $15.9 billion and $6.90 billion respectively, according to L2BEAT.However, Base has risen from $1 billion to $5.4 billion in less than three months after it taking six months to break the $1 billion milestone, Meanwhile, Arbitrum One and OP Mainnet have seen their TVLs tallies fall over the last two months.Coinbase officially launched Base last August.

Biden Is "Destroying Crypto": Cardano Founder Lambasts Admin - DailyCoin


        
President Joe Biden has vowed to shut down Congress’s efforts to open banks to crypto customers.



Charles Hoskinson launched a tirade against the Biden administration.



The Cardano founder claimed that a vote for Biden was a vote against crypto.
The US crypto industry has been in a multi-year intense battle with the Biden administration, trying to navigate the nation’s murky and tangled web of legislation and its alleged campaign against digital assets.Hope glimmered for the industry after the US House of Representatives passed a groundbreaking resolution on Wednesday to overturn the SEC’s crypto accounting guidance, which had barred banks from handling crypto customers. However, before Congress could celebrate, US President Joe Biden vowed to stay the course with his anti-crypto stance, pledging to veto any pro-crypto legislation.
Appalled and angered by President Biden’s statement, many influential figures in the industry voiced their concerns, including Cardano founder Charles Hoskinson, who accused the current administration of hurting the US’ standing in the global crypto arena.A Vote For Biden is a Vote Against Crypto, Charles Hoskinson“Please understand the intent of this administration is to destroy the American cryptocurrency industry,” Charles Hoskinson warned in his latest social media post, expressing his deep-seated concerns about President Biden’s pledge to derail a major development for the crypto industry. The Cardano founder was visibly upset by President Biden’s statement, promising to veto the US House of Representatives’s decision to potentially allow banks to deal with crypto customers by rejecting the SAB 121 legislation that the SEC issued prohibiting banks from dealing with crypto.In his tirade, Hoskinson accused the current US administration of perpetuating lies throughout the years and hurting the crypto industry in “every way possible.” The crypto pundit highlighted a series of enforcement actions by the White House, including restricting access to bank accounts and deliberately avoiding clarity to impede legislative processes.
“A vote for Biden is a vote against cryptocurrencies,” Charles Hoksinson claimed. The contentious founder lamented that it caused him a great degree of heartburn to witness an industry with the potential to create hundreds of thousands of jobs being pushed beyond borders, despite many of the underlying technologies originating on US soil.Hoskinson Worries Biden is Driving Crypto Out of US SoilIn his video, the Cardano Founder highlighted the US’s pivotal role in inventing cryptography and algorithms, emphasizing the abundance of talent and infrastructure within the country. However, despite these advantages, President Biden’s staunch anti-crypto stance threatens to harm the industry and the 53 million Americans holding cryptocurrencies severely.The rowdy pundit cautioned President Biden’s hostile policies could trigger a brain drain from the country and potentially allow rivals like China and the Middle East to leverage or weaponize crypto against the US. However, while President Biden’s administration doubles down on the crypto industry, his major rival, former President Donald Trump, is embracing the asset class with open arms. Trump Rubber Stamps Crypto During a recent gala dinner Q&A with collectors of his “Mugshot Edition” NFT collection, Trump expressed his support for the besieged US crypto industry. When asked what he would do about firms leaving the US over regulatory hostility, Trump responded, “We’ll stop it because I don’t want that.” "If we're going to embrace [the crypto industry] then we have to let them be here," Trump added. During the session, the former president also took the opportunity to mock President Biden’s understanding of digital assets while drawing a line between both parties by distinguishing Democrats as the anti-crypto party. In contrast, Trump endorsed cryptocurrencies by saying, “I’m good with it.”Basking in the spotlight, President Trump delivered a parting shot: "If you're in favor of crypto, you better vote for Trump."On the Flipside
Crypto policy is not a concern for most voting Americans, as just 17% have invested in digital assets.



Under the U.S. Constitution, the House could override President Biden’s veto with a two-thirds majority vote.



Donald Trump’s campaign has announced that it will also accept cryptocurrency in donations.
Why This MattersThe crypto industry has been subjected to several punitive enforcement actions and regulatory crackdowns in recent years. President Biden’s pledge to veto pro-crypto legislation reveals Democrats’ public disdain for digital assets. Charles Hoskinson’s warning is important and should be considered, given that elections are only months away.FTX promises to offer pay more than what it owes to customers:FTX Pens Plan Promising 118% Cash Back to CreditorsCharles Hoskinson mulls Bitcoin Cash integration:Cardano’s Hoskinson Gauges Bitcoin Cash Integration With Poll

                        Georgia’s security service has claimed overseas actors are using crypto to fund a spate of protests that have divided the country.Thousands have taken to the streets in the capital Tbilisi in recent days, with smaller protests also taking place in the cities of Zugdidi, Kutaisi, and Gori.But the State Security Service of Georgia (SSSG) says the masterminds behind the protests are using “funds from abroad.”And, the SSSG claimed, protest organizers are making use of crypto in a bid to “cover their tracks.”
Georgia Protests Are ‘Crypto Funded,’ Says Intelligence Agency
The SSSG is Georgia’s state intelligence agency. Per the Georgian media outlet Ambebi, the SSSG said that “a group of people” based overseas is “planning and organizing rallies in the Georgian capital.”The agency claimed that these individuals want to engineer “destructive and violent incidents.” And the SSSG said:
“Citizens of Georgia who are based abroad – in particular a certain group of Georgians participating in the hostilities in Ukraine – in taking part in criminal plans.”
The agency accused these overseas “agents” of plotting to sabotage Tbilisi’s traffic networks.The agency said agents also plan to barricade access to the roads around government institutions and strategic facilities.It claimed these same individuals plan to block railway networks and “set up encampments” outside law enforcement agencies. The SSSG explained:
“[The masterminds] funds are receiving funds from abroad. And they are using cryptocurrency, in many cases, to cover their tracks.”
The SSSG thinks that “foreign instructors” visited Georgia “at the end of April of this year” to conduct “cryptocurrency transaction-related training sessions.”It said that “the organizers” of the protests “received instructions on how to secretly receive funding” for their “radical actions.”Bill Sparks Fury in Georgia
Protests have raged in Tbilisi in recent days, with many taking to the streets to vent their anger about a so-called “foreign agents” bill.Many have taken to the streets waving EU flags, apparently concerned that their nation’s bid to join the European Union could result in failure.The Georgian parliament is poised to vote on a bill that proposes labeling all political and civil society NGOs that receive over 20% of their funding from overseas “foreign agents.”Critics say the bill is a copy of a Russian law that seeks to identify “foreign agents.” Moscow parliamentarians have accused Western-backed “foreign agents” of using crypto from abroad to fund their activities in Russia.EU Membership Plans in Jeopardy?
An article in the British magazine The Spectator claimed:
“Such a law would [..] dash any hope of Georgia joining the EU. This week, in reaction to the government’s heavy-handed attempts to disperse the protestors, more than 30 members of the European Parliament called on Brussels to withdraw Georgia’s EU membership candidate status.”
The bill has become a political hot potato in Georgia, where President Salome Zourabichvili says she intends to veto the bill.The nation’s parliament, however, has the power to overrule a Zourabichvili veto.Western media commentators have claimed that the result of the vote could “mean revolution” for Georgia.Government officials have claimed the protestors are agitated by Western-backed groups seeking a “revolution.”The SSSG said that the protesters’ goal is to spark violence and “provoke law enforcement agencies.”The agency warned of the danger of “panic, stampedes, serious injuries, and casualties” should the demonstrations continue.Crypto remains popular in Georgia, as does crypto mining. In 2018, the nation began exploring plans to adopt blockchain technology in government operations.

Shiba Doge Hybrid (SHIDOGE) to Skyrocket 8,000% as MEXC Listing Announced, While Shiba Inu and Dogecoin Struggle



                    

Shiba Doge Hybrid (SHIDOGE) could turn early investors into multi-millionaires if it becomes a mainstream coin, like Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE).



Shiba Doge Hybrid (SHIDOGE), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is poised to explode over 8,000% in price in the coming days.




This is because SHIDOGE has announced its first centralized exchange listing, which will be on MEXC.



This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up.



Currently, Shiba Doge Hybrid (SHIDOGE) can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jupiter and Raydium, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days.



Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Shiba Doge Hybrid (SHIDOGE) could become the next viral memecoin.



To buy Shiba Doge Hybrid on Raydium or Jupiter ahead of the MEXC listing, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for SHIDOGE by entering its contract address – 797CmcxqkLZaSjMd7MdyNZ9swuSzaGdYWkJ65jehiXWa – in the receiving field.



In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price.



If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner.




The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum.



This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like SHIDOGE.

If You Invested $1,000 In Bitcoin When Donald Trump Said The Crypto's Value Was 'Based On Thin Air,' Here's How Much You'd Have Now - Benzinga

Former President Donald Trump spoke positively about cryptocurrency during a speech Wednesday, May 8, 2024. The comments from Trump are creating optimism for the crypto market under a potential re-election of Trump in the 2024 presidential election.Trump Flips On Crypto Opinion: While Trump praised the cryptocurrency market during his speech, also saying his campaign would accept crypto for donations and pro-crypto voters should support him, he hasn't always been supportive of cryptocurrency."If you like crypto in any form … if you're in favor of crypto you'd better vote for Trump," the former president said to the crowd on May 8.Trump has been known for being vocal about a number of topics and people over the years, often sharing those opinions on social media platforms. One of the many sectors Trump has been outspoken about is the cryptocurrency sector.In 2019, Trump spoke out about Bitcoin BTC/USD and cryptocurrency."I am not a fan of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, which are not money, and whose value is highly volatile and based on thin air," Trump tweeted on July 11, 2019.Trump also went on to call out Libra, a virtual currency that Meta Platforms Inc META was working on at the time."If Facebook and other companies want to become a bank, they must seek a new Banking Charter and become subject to all Banking Regulations, just like other Banks."Trump said the real currency is the U.S. dollar, which he added would remain the "most dominant currency anywhere in the world."Investing $1,000 in Bitcoin: On the day Trump blasted Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies, the leading cryptocurrency traded between $11,158.92 and $12,144.62.Based on the high of the day, an investor could have purchased 0.0823 BTC at the time of Trump's tweet.That $1,000 investment would be worth $5,138.70 today based on a price of $62,438.61 for Bitcoin at the time of writing. This represents a return of 413.9%.At its peak of $73,750.07 set in March 2024, the investment would have been worth $6,069.63, up 506.9% from the time of Trump's tweet.Related Link: EXCLUSIVE: Cathie Wood Says Bitcoin Is Key 2024 Election Issue For Young VotersWhy It's Important: While he criticized Bitcoin in 2019, Trump would later use the power of cryptocurrency to launch his own non-fungible token collection. Trump has now launched three NFT collections since December 2022. Many on social media were quick to point out the previous comments against cryptocurrency by the former president at the time his NFTs launched.The price of Bitcoin soared in 2023 and 2024, rebounding from a 2022 year that saw a drop in the price due to volatility from the bankruptcies of several cryptocurrency trading platforms.The approval of Bitcoin ETFs in 2024 increased optimism for the crypto sector and helped kick off new all-time highs for Bitcoin months later.Skeptics of Bitcoin such as Trump have been proven wrong over the years with the price of Bitcoin soaring to new highs and gains outpacing other assets.This article was previously published by Benzinga and has been updated.Read Next: If You Invested $1,000 In Meta Platforms Stock When Donald Trump Said Facebook Was Always Anti-Trump, Here’s How Much You’d Have NowPhotos: Shutterstock

How Wall Street scored big in the FTX bankruptcy mess | Cryptopolitan

Wall Street never misses a beat, even in the throes of cryptocurrency chaos. When FTX, once a titan in the crypto exchange world, stumbled into bankruptcy in November 2022, savvy investors from the traditional finance realm were already positioning themselves to profit.Opportunistic Moves Amid CrisisIn the immediate aftermath of FTX’s collapse, the price of claims against the company plummeted, trading for mere pennies on the dollar. Veteran investment firms like Attestor, Farallon, Oaktree, and Silver Point capitalized on the turmoil. These players, accustomed to the high-stakes game of distressed assets, began scooping up claims for as low as 20 cents on the dollar. They wagered on the eventual recovery of FTX’s assets, a bet that would require patience and a keen eye for timing.As the bankruptcy proceedings unfolded, the task at hand was clear: liquidate every asset FTX had touched—from digital tokens to venture capital stakes—and convert them into cash. This massive sell-off coincided with a surge in cryptocurrency values, inflating the returns on these distressed assets. Before long, claims that once seemed nearly worthless were trading close to their full value.Despite the complexity of the situation, including competing claims from government entities like the Department of Justice and the IRS, the restructuring plan moved swiftly. Under the guidance of John Ray III, the newly appointed CEO tasked with navigating the bankruptcy, FTX managed to outline a path to significant recovery for its creditors. The stark contrast to prolonged liquidations of the past, such as those following the Enron and Lehman Brothers scandals, highlighted the efficiency of the process this time around.The Windfall in WaitingPatience paid off handsomely for those who had the foresight to invest in FTX’s beleaguered claims. The total face value of these claims was around $12 billion, but with the assets liquidated and the market rebound, total recoveries are projected to surpass $15 billion. This represents a staggering gain, largely benefiting the few who dared to bet against the tide.Meanwhile, the typical FTX account holders faced mixed emotions. Although the plan proposed a return of 118 cents on the dollar based on the cryptocurrency prices at their lowest in 2022, these individuals missed out on the dramatic price rallies that followed. Their recovery, substantial as it may seem, did not fully capitalize on the market’s upturn.The narrative of FTX’s fall and partial redemption is a testament to Wall Street’s acumen in navigating financial disasters. While the crypto community had heralded platforms like FTX as pioneers of financial democratization, the old guards of finance—armed with experience and capital—were the ones who emerged in a position to dictate terms.Despite the resolution appearing favorable, with almost all small creditors set to recover fully, the larger story is the reminder of traditional finance’s resilience and strategic depth. The swift and strategic actions by investment firms amidst FTX’s collapse illustrate a broader theme: in the world of high finance, timing, and experience often triumph over turmoil.As the final details of the bankruptcy plan await court approval, stakeholders from across the financial spectrum are watching closely. FTX’s saga is far from a solitary event. Rather, it’s a clear indicator of how the financial establishment adapts and thrives, even as the ground changes beneath it.

EigenLayer's EIGEN Airdrop Might Signal Demise of Once-Popular 'Points'

But when it comes to protecting investors and offering transparency, Robert Leshner, the founder of Compound and Robot Ventures, an investor in EigenLayer developer Eigen Labs, thinks points are the worst of all worlds. "The entire root of investor protection is making sure that there's not an information asymmetry between the investors and the sponsors. And points create the largest information asymmetry that exists in crypto," he said. "Everything is at the team's discretion, and users and investors are just praying that they get treated right by the team."

Bitcoin could soon ‘BLOW higher’ on bullish candle hammer: Glassnode execs

Bitcoin (BTC) traders are pointing to a “bullish candle hammer” that has emerged on Bitcoin’s weekly price chart — which they say could signal a possible reversal of the past month’s downtrend.“Bitcoin still looks like it is about to BLOW higher,” market intelligence firm Glassnode founders Jan Happel and Yana Allemann wrote on their shared X account “Negentropic” in a post on May 9. They noted that the Bitcoin price chart closed on May 5 with a bullish hammer — the name given when there is a small body above a thin long line, referred to as a “wick.”“Bitcoin weekly bullish hammer candle…reversal is imminent,” added pseudonymous crypto trader Mister Crypto.Source: Mister CryptoIt could signal a reversal as traders pushed prices down significantly during the 7 days, but buyers managed to aggressively close it near the candle open, suggesting a shift in sentiment.“This week’s pullback hence seems like a healthy correction before higher. Corrections often pull back either 50% or 61.8% of the previous impulse move,” Negentropic said.Pseudonymous crypto trader Rekt Capital explained that long downside wicks have often been key to ending more than 20% corrections for Bitcoin “for the past year and a half,” in a May 9 X post.Bitcoin closed the week ending May 5 at $64,109, as per CoinMarketCap data. A 20% increase from this level would take it beyond its current all-time high, reaching $76,822.At the time of publication, Bitcoin’s price is $62,830.Bitcoin's price is down 8.93% over the last 30 days. Source: CoinMarketCapHowever, crypto trader Mags anticipates that it may come up slightly short of that estimate, though not by much.“If price holds the current levels, the next stop would be a range high of $72,000,” they stated to their 73,300 X followers on May 9.Related: Bitcoin distribution ‘danger zone’ over, analysts sayAlthough this single candle pattern is seen as a bullish signal to traders, most wait for confirmation of the change of direction in the following candle.

Andrew Tate Coin (ANDTATE) Will Explode 16,000% Ahead of MEXC Listing, While Shiba Inu, Bonk and Dogecoin Struggle



                    

Early investors in memecoins like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Bonk (BONK), and Dogecoin (DOGE) made astronomical returns, and Andrew Tate Coin (ANDTATE) presents a similar opportunity for a limited time.



Andrew Tate Coin (ANDTATE), a newly launched Solana memecoin, is poised to explode over 16,000% in a matter of days, as former Shiba Inu (SHIB), Bonk (BONK) and Dogecoin (DOGE) investors pour funds into this new token.




ANDTATE will be listed on MEXC, one of the largest centralized exchanges in the world, within a few days – and this is a massively bullish development for the token, as millions of new investors will easily be able to buy Andrew Tate Coin.



Currently, Andrew Tate Coin can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jupiter and Raydium, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. 



To buy ANDTATE on these platforms, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Andrew Tate Coin by entering its contract address – Cp7qyqdzXAqF7fqKXzS8LwTE7JQvh2V3vYGnDdx6j4ii – in the receiving field.




ANDTATE currently has a market cap of just under $20,000, meaning it has huge upside potential.



Early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and Bonk (BONK) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. 



If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner.

Marathon Digital misses Q1 estimates on bad weather, utility failures

Bitcoin (BTC) miner Marathon Digital missed Wall Street analysts’ revenue estimates in its first quarter 2024 results, blaming bad weather and equipment failures.Marathon’s Q1 revenues increased 223% year-on-year to $165.2 million in results shared on May 9 — but it still missed the $193.9 million estimate from investment analyst firm Zacks by 14.80%.The firm mined 2,811 BTC over the quarter, currently worth $176.7 million, a 28% bump from a year ago but down 34% from the 4,242 BTC mined in Q4 2023.On a May 9 earnings call, Marathon CEO Fred Thiel said its production was marred by “unexpected equipment failures, predominantly transformers that our third-party hosted sites, utility company transmission line maintenance and a higher than anticipated weather-related curtailments across multiple sites.”In its earnings report, Marathon said the bad weather hit its Garden City site in central Texas and “other sites.” It acquired the Texas site on April 2.He added it “mitigated a number of these issues” and was operating at “a record high” of 27 exahashes per second (EH/s)Thiel clung to its expectation that it would ramp up to 50 EH/s by the end of the year which it bumped up in late April from its prior target of 35 to 37 EH/s. The BTC miner’s first-quarter net income was up 184% year-on-year to $337.2 million, a $1.26 earnings per share that topped the $0.02 Zacks estimate.However, its income was boosted by new Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) rules that Marathon adopted allowing it to record the $488.8 million quarterly paper gain it had on the 17,320 BTC it held as of March 31.Related: Digital Currency Group first-quarter revenue jumps 51% despite GBTC outflowsMarathon Digital (MARA) shares closed 2.19% down on May 9 at $19.65 and fell an additional 1% in after-hours trading, according to Google Finance.MARA hit an after-hours session low of $18.60 before recovering to $19.45.

Bitcoin & Ethereum Decouple From Trad Markets, What It Means


								Data shows that Bitcoin and Ethereum correlate little to traditional markets, implying that cryptocurrency is forging its destiny.
Bitcoin & Ethereum Have Been The Master Of Their Fates Recently
According to data from the market intelligence platform IntoTheBlock, the correlation between BTC and ETH with traditional markets and commodities has been close to zero recently.
The “correlation” here refers to the correlation coefficient (r) from statistics, a metric that tracks how connected two quantities have been over a given period.

When the value of this metric is greater than zero for any two assets, it means that there exists some positive correlation between their prices, implying that the assets are moving in tandem. The closer this value is to 1, the tighter the relationship.
On the other hand, the indicator’s negative value suggests that while there is some correlation between the two, it’s a negative one, as the price of one asset reacts to movements in the other by moving oppositely to it. In this case, the extreme where the correlation is the strongest is -1.
The correlation coefficient standing at or near zero suggests no relationship between the assets. In statistics, the variables are said to be independent in this case.
Now, here is a table that shows how the 30-day correlation between the two largest cryptocurrencies by market cap, Bitcoin and Ethereum, looks like against some of the traditional assets:

The data for the correlation matrix of BTC and ETH | Source: IntoTheBlock on X
As is visible above, Bitcoin and Ethereum have appeared to have a low correlation to these assets over the past month. Out of these, the coins are the most correlated to the S&P 500, with the coefficient standing at 0.4 for BTC and 0.49 for ETH.
Thus, this would mean that ETH is slightly more correlated to the S&P 500 than BTC. Like this, ETH also has a more prominent relationship with the others on the list compared to BTC, although it’s still not strongly correlated to any of them.
The low correlation coefficient with the traditional markets suggests that cryptocurrencies have been running more or less independently in the past month.

Generally, correlation can be something to watch when an investor is looking to add an asset to their portfolio. Assets that have a high correlation make up for poor diversifying options, as they would either mimic a similar performance (positive coefficient) or counteract each other (negative coefficient).
Since Bitcoin and Ethereum lack any solid correlation to traditional markets and commodities, the two coins may be viable options for traditional investors to add to their portfolios.

BlockFi to shut down web platform, turn to Coinbase as distribution partner

Bankrupt crypto lender BlockFi said on May 9 that it would shut down its web platform by the end of May and rely primarily on Coinbase as a distribution partner.The change ensures that BlockFi Interest Account (BIA), Retail Loan, and Private Clients can continue to access withdrawals as part of the bankruptcy claims process.Crypto-eligible customers will be able to access funds in kind if they have an open or approved Coinbase account. The condition applies to crypto-eligible customers who did not withdraw crypto from BlockFi’s web platform by April 28 or did not verify their identity by May 10.Crypto-eligible customers who do not create a Coinbase account or cannot create one will instead receive funds in cash.BlockFi emphasized that it has not partnered with any other crypto companies for distributions and warned users of scams from bad actors claiming otherwise.BlockFi and Coinbase will contact users who are on file with instructions.BlockFi’s FTX fundsThe plan administrator in BlockFi’s bankruptcy case may perform future distributions through Coinbase, including those related to funds recovered from FTX.BlockFi was expected to receive nearly $875 million from FTX as of March. Only the first $250 million is prioritized, while the remainder depends on FTX’s ability to pay customers in its own case.BlockFi said that, without Coinbase’s involvement, the plan administrator would only be able to make cash distributions rather than crypto distributions going forward.BlockFi originally filed for halted withdrawals on Nov. 10, 2022, citing a “lack of clarity” around FTX’s separate bankruptcy as the reason for its own shutdown. Weeks later, BlockFi entered bankruptcy proceedings that revealed FTX as its second-largest creditor.BlockFi emerged from bankruptcy in October 2023 and began to pay users this year. FTX remains in bankruptcy proceedings.Mentioned in this articlePosted In: US, Bankruptcy

Grayscale Battling Outflows And Lower-Cost ETFs, Q1 Revenue Stays Flat At $156M


																Grayscale Investments, the issuer of one of the recently approved spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) in the US, saw flat revenues in the first quarter of the year due to its decision to maintain fees on its flagship Grayscale Bitcoin Trust ETF (GBTC). 
Grayscale Exceeds Expectations Despite Outflows
According to a shareholder letter from its parent company, Digital Currency Group (DCG), the operator of the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust recorded $156 million in revenue, showing little change from the previous quarter.

	Related Reading



Since the GBTC trust’s conversion to an ETF in January, Grayscale has seen outflows of about $17.4 billion as investors appear to have shifted their assets to new, lower-cost funds offered by BlackRock and Fidelity, the leaders in the US ETF race in terms of inflows recorded since January. 
While GBTC charges a 1.5% management fee, many of its competitors charge less than 0.3%, leading to outflows. In response, Grayscale announced plans in March to seek approval from the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to spin off some of Grayscale’s assets into a new, lower-fee “Bitcoin Mini Trust.” 
Despite the outflows, the Q1 revenue attributable to GBTC exceeded Grayscale’s expectations. The firm had previously anticipated outflows due to increased competition under the ETF wrapper. Grayscale previously charged a 2% sponsorship fee before the trust was converted. 
The flat revenue was also attributed to higher average Bitcoin and Ethereum prices and a decrease in assets under management (AUM).
In contrast to Grayscale’s performance, all US spot Bitcoin ETFs have witnessed a total net inflow of over $11 billion thus far. However, demand for these ETFs has recently declined amidst tightening financial conditions in the US, where the Federal Reserve (Fed) faces the challenge of addressing persistent inflation.
DCG Reports 11% Q1 Revenue Increase
Digital Currency Group, founded by Barry Silbert and the parent company of Grayscale, reported an 11% quarter-over-quarter increase in Q1 revenue to $229 million, primarily due to higher asset prices. 
However, revenue growth lagged behind Bitcoin’s price appreciation, which rose more than 60% during the same period. In its letter, DCG attributed this disparity to lower GBTC sponsor fees, redemptions, and steady mining revenues at its Foundry subsidiary.

Foundry, DCG’s mining subsidiary, experienced a sequential revenue increase of 35%, propelled by staking and equipment sales revenue. Meanwhile, Luno, the company’s crypto exchange subsidiary, witnessed a 46% quarter-over-quarter sales boost, driven by a significant surge in trading volume.

Australia’s Tax Office Targets 1.2 Million Crypto Users in Compliance Crackdown



                    

Australia’s tax authorities are stepping up their efforts to address tax compliance among cryptocurrency users, reflecting a global trend towards stricter regulation of digital assets.



The Australian Taxation Office (ATO) is seeking detailed personal and transaction data from up to 1.2 million users of cryptocurrency exchanges. 




This initiative is part of a broader attempt to identify those who may have skirted tax obligations on their crypto trades, as detailed in a notice issued last month, which was obtained by Reuters.



The ATO’s data request includes not only basic identity information like users’ birth dates, but also extends to their social media accounts, phone numbers, and financial particulars such as wallet addresses, the types of coins traded, and associated bank account details. 



The notice explains that cryptocurrencies, unlike traditional foreign currencies, are considered taxable assets in Australia. 




This classification means that profits from cryptocurrency sales are subject to capital gains tax.



This move by the ATO coincides with significant profits in the cryptocurrency markets, highlighted by substantial increases in the values of major cryptocurrencies. 



Bitcoin, for instance, has seen a 44% increase since the start of the year, while Ether’s value has risen by 32%. 



Additionally, the market capitalization of other significant altcoins (excluding Bitcoin and Ether) has climbed over 27%, according to TradingView.




READ MORE: Bullish Momentum Looms: Bitcoin’s Price Eyeing Upsurge on Inverse Head-and-Shoulders Confirmation



The ATO notice points to the potential for using cryptocurrencies for tax evasion due to the possibility of purchasing crypto assets under false identities. 



This concern is not isolated to Australia, as similar regulatory actions are taking place globally. 



For example, the Canada Revenue Agency’s compliance branch director general, Sahil Behal, disclosed that the agency is conducting over 400 crypto-related audits and investigating numerous crypto investors to recover unpaid taxes. 



This action builds on the discovery of an estimated $39.5 million in unpaid taxes from the 2023-2024 fiscal year.



In Turkey, upcoming legislation expected later this year aims to establish a legal framework for taxing cryptocurrencies, recognizing the country’s position as a significant player in the crypto economy. 



Meanwhile, in the United States, there are proposals to increase the long-term capital gains tax rate to 44.6% for high earners, alongside a potential 25% tax on unrealized gains for extremely wealthy individuals. 



According to Matthew Walrath, founder of Crypto Tax Made Easy, despite these stringent proposals, they are unlikely to affect the vast majority of people, describing them as “a big, fat nothing burger” since they are still merely proposals.

Bitcoin’s Ordinals, Runes key to solving the mining subsidy problem: ViaBTC

Bitcoin transaction fees from applications such as Ordinals, Runes and BRC-20s will be key to making sure miners stick around even as more halving events occur, according to a cryptocurrency mining pool.“[The Bitcoin network’s] evolution has led to an expanding array of use cases and a growing user base [which] has significantly impacted miners’ fee income from on-chain transactions,” ViaBTC told Cointelegraph in a recent interview.Prior to the Ordinals protocol’s launch in January 2023, miners relied on peer-to-peer transaction fees to accompany the block subsidy — which halves every 210,000 blocks and thus has an “indisputable” impact on miners’ revenue over the long haul, ViaBTC said.Mining revenue can also increase with a rise in Bitcoin’s (BTC) price, but further development at the application layer will increase network activity, broaden its utility and thereby compensate miners handsomely, ViaBTC explained.ViaBTC experienced this first hand on April 20 when it mined the highly sought-after halving block, at block 840,000, which came with a record-setting 37.6 BTC transaction fee — worth $2.4 million at the time.The reward, which totaled 40.7 BTC when factoring in the new 3.125 BTC block subsidy, came from memecoin and nonfungible token enthusiasts competing to inscribe “rare satoshis” and fungible tokens via the new Runes token standard, which launched at the halving block. Source: 10x ResearchViaBTC told Cointelegraph it had a “premonition” that transaction fees would eventually break the 30, 40, 50 BTC barrier but didn’t expect they would be the beneficiaries of such a massive reward — let alone at the halving block. While Bitcoin miners cashed in an eye-popping $78.3 million on halving day, they’ve also made more from fees than Ethereum stakers and Uniswap liquidity providers in nine of the last 20 days since the halving, according to Crypto Fees.Fees by blockchains and protocols on April 20. Source: Crypto FeesBitcoin’s pseudonymous creator, Satoshi Nakamoto, predicted that transaction fees would eventually become miners’ main compensation source as the block subsidy halves, ViaBTC noted.Related: Bitcoin post-halving price consolidation could last 2 months — Bitfinex“If these transactions find broader utility in the future and make significant technological advancements, they may garner increased attention and recognition,” ViaBTC added.However, Ordinals inscriptions, Runes and BRC-20s have seen several rises and falls in popularity since each protocol launched, which has brought about some instability in miner revenue.ViaBTC has endured three halving events since it started operating in 2016, with block 840,000 being the 37,534th block that it had mined in its 2,900-day existence.The mining pool’s hash rate is sourced from miners in 118 countries.Magazine: 68% of Runes are in the red — Are they really an upgrade for Bitcoin?

								One of the issuers of spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) in the US, WisdomTree, has announced the expansion of its WisdomTree Prime app to users in New York. 

Expanded Custody And Stablecoin Services
This development closely follows WisdomTree’s recent achievement of a New York State Department of Financial Services (DFS) charter, granting the company the status of a limited-purpose trust company under the New York Banking Law. 
This charter enables the asset manager to custody digital assets, including offering digital wallet services, issuing and exchanging DFS-approved stablecoins, and managing stablecoin reserves through its newly established entity, WisdomTree Digital Trust Company.
According to the asset manager’s announcement, the trust charter and added authorities enable WisdomTree Digital Trust Company to provide increased customer protection, particularly regarding asset safekeeping. 
WisdomTree Prime App And Visa Debit Card Make Joint Debut In NY
The launch of the WisdomTree Prime app in New York coincides with the recent introduction of the WisdomTree Prime Visa Debit Card issued by Stride Bank. 
According to the Bitcoin ETF issuer, this card will allow users to purchase with their available wallet balance wherever Visa is accepted, effectively bridging personal finance and digital asset investing. 

Will Peck, Head of Digital Assets at WisdomTree, expressed his excitement about the company’s accomplishments:
Since our initial entry into select states’ app stores last summer, we have gained significant momentum across various fronts, including the launch of new digital funds, payment capabilities, and collaborations with regulators like the New York State Department of Financial Services. Our aim is to empower consumers in utilizing digital assets in their everyday financial lives. We are excited to provide retail investors in New York with access to the app, as we recognize the rapid growth of the digital asset market in this region, which we expect to be highly influential for WisdomTree Prime.
In addition to New York, WisdomTree Prime has gone live in several other states, including Connecticut, Delaware, Idaho, Louisiana, Maine, Nevada, and Ohio, bringing the total number of states in which it is available to 41.

Tether slams Deutsche Bank over suggestion its stablecoin could fail

Stablecoin giant Tether has slammed Deutsche Bank over a newly released report suggesting that stablecoins — including its dollar-pegged token Tether (USDT) — could witness a “peso moment,” that would wreak havoc on the crypto industry. In a May 7 research report on stablecoins, Deutsche analysts cited the 2022 collapse of the Terraform Lab’s algorithmic stablecoin TerraUSD (TUSD) which saw at least $40 billion wiped from the market in a few days, as cause for wider criticism of dollar-pegged stablecoin products.From a study of 334 currency pegs from the last 223 years, analysts found that 49% of fixed currencies failed over the course of their median life span of approximately eight to ten years. 42% of European consumers believed stablecoins would fail eventually. Source: Deutsche BankThe analysts concluded that most of the pegged assets in the crypto space will experience significant “turbulence” stemming from speculative sentiment and eventually suffer some kind of de-pegging event. “While some may survive, most will likely fail, particularly due to the lack of transparency in stablecoin operations and vulnerability to speculative sentiment.”Deutsche analysts also noted Tether’s lack of transparency concerning its reserves and described the firm’s solvency status as “questionable.”However, Tether lashed out at Deutsche’s report, saying it “lacks clarity and substantial evidence” and relies on “vague assertions rather than rigorous analysis.”In comments shared with Cointelegraph, a Tether spokesperson said that while the report attempts to forecast the decline of stablecoins, it failed to “provide concrete data to support its claims.”“Moreover, its comparison to Terra, an algorithmic stablecoin, is misleading and irrelevant to the discussion on reserve-backed coins,” said Tether in response. “Questioning the credibility of any financial institution, especially one with Deutsche Bank's track record, seems ironic. Deutsche Bank's history of fines and penalties raises doubts about its own standing to critique others in the industry.”Related: Tokenizing money is the ‘greatest innovation’ after fiat — Tether co-founderTether has been the subject of criticism over the transparency of its reserves.However, the firm has released several financial attestations, which suggest the firm holds over $110 billion in fiat-denominated reserves — though some critics argue it’s not the same as a financial audit. Audits are conducted to look at data, risks, or compliance issues that may not have been known before the audit took place while an attestation is a more simple tool used to take a snapshot of certain data. In 2021, the New York Attorney General settled with Tether to pay an $18.5 million fine and barred it from practicing in the state for allegedly misrepresenting the degree to which its reserves were backed fiat collateral. Despite never releasing an official audit since the firm’s inception in 2014, Cantor Fitzgerald CEO Howard Lutnick says he believes Tether “has the money,” on hand.

Coinbase's Hidden Gem: Analysts See ‘Amazon-like’ Potential in Layer-2 Network Base | Cryptoglobe


                                
Cryptocurrency asset manager Bitwise has recently shared analysis on the Nasdaq-listed cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase (NASDAQ: COIN), suggesting it could be in a similar position to Amazon before it exploded and became a near $2 trillion company.



According to Bitwise’s analysis there’s a “game-changer hidden in Coinbase’s recent earnings report,” namely its Ethereum layer-2 network Base that allows users to move funds on Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) compatible decentralized applications for next to no cost.



Coinbase reported net revenue of $1.6 billion in the first quarter of the year, seeing a rise of 72% quarter-on-quarter and 116% year-over-year, beating analyst estimates of $1.36 billion. Its trading revenue, on a quarter-on-quarter basis, rose 93%, while institutional trading revenue rose 105% and stablecoin revenue 15%.



Its blockchain rewards revenue rose 59% over the same period, with the firm’s total profits hitting $1.2 billion while total cash on hand rose to $7.1 billion. To Bitwise’s analysts, a “little-noticed crypto-native business line” they believe could be a game changer is Base itself, which account for 1% of the firm’s revenues in the first quarter.







They noted that when “something is much cheaper, faster, and easier to use, people are going to use more of it,” and added Base is the “fastest-growing Layer 2, with transactions rising 74% quarter-over-quarter in Q1.” Base, they added, processed 40% more transactions in April alone than in the whole first quarter, while Coinbase’s CEO Brian Armstrong said the number of developers on it is surging.



As a result, Bitwise added, Base could be a “massive revenue generator for Coinbase, with extremely high gross margins.” Coinbase is a “sequencer” verifying transactions on the Layer-2 network, which batches them before posting them to the Ethereum mainnet.







            
            

            
            

            
            

        

Coinbase is the only sequencer on Base for now and as a result pocketed $15.5 million in fees in the first quarter of the year, out of $27.4 million Base users paid in transaction fees to use the network. In April, those fees accounted for $11 million of Coinbase’s revenue.



The analysts added:



If Base continues to grow, it could reliably deliver $10 million, $20 million, or more in profit to Coinbase each month. In the longer term, if Base becomes the primary network on which developers build applications, Coinbase could end up owning a core piece of crypto infrastructure. 



Bitwise further noted that some noted “this could put Coinbase in a similar position to Amazon,” as Amazon started off with selling books online before expanding, and now over half of its profits come from its cloud computing service Amazon Web Services.



Similarly, Coinbase could become a core infrastructure provider within the cryptocurrency ecosystem.

Latest Bitcoin Top Is Different From 2021 Peak, Analyst Explains Why


																An analyst has explained why the recent high in Bitcoin has experienced different market conditions than those observed during the 2021 bull run peak.
Bitcoin Liquidations Have Been Short-Dominated In Recent Market High
In a new post on X, on-chain analyst Checkmate pointed out how the latest 2024 high achieved following the spot exchange-traded fund (ETF) inflows has a major difference when compared to the 2021 peak.

	Related Reading



The difference lies in the trend registered on derivatives markets. Below is the chart shared by the analyst that shows the trend in the dominance of long liquidations in the sector over the last few years.

The distribution of liquidations on derivatives market over the last few years | Source: @_Checkmatey_ on X
“Liquidation” here naturally refers to the act of forceful closure that any derivatives market contract undergoes on an exchange when it accumulates losses of a certain degree.
The risk of a contract getting liquidated becomes higher, and the more volatile the asset price gets. During sharp rallies and crashes, huge amounts of liquidation can pile up in the market.
From the chart, it’s visible that as the rally in the cryptocurrency had occurred this year, the short holders had been taking a beating. This was only natural as surges pile up losses for these investors betting on a decline, so price growth as rapid as the one witnessed would have pushed many of these contracts toward liquidation.
Interestingly, the scale of the short dominance maintained throughout the run, implying that the investors didn’t quite believe the run would continue any further at every point of the rally, so they bet against it.
This has also remained true in the recent stagnation following the top, as short liquidations have outweighed the long ones even though the price has decreased.
As is apparent in the graph, the 2021 peaks saw a different trend. Longs were getting liquidated as Bitcoin topped out during both the first half of the 2021 peak and the second half.
In those periods, the investors had become too greedy and were only betting on the rise to continue even when the asset had slowed down. This greed appears to haven’t overtaken the market in the bull run.
While the current Bitcoin rally differs from the last one in this metric, analyst Maartunn has pointed out in an X post another indicator where the trend appears to be similar to that observed in previous peaks.

Looks like the value of the metric has been plunging in recent days | Source: @JA_Maartun on X
This indicator is the Coin Days Destroyed (CDD), which basically tells us about the scale of dormant coin movement that’s happening in the market right now. It would appear that this metric had attained very high levels recently.

“Coin Days Destroyed has probably peaked,” says Maartunn. “Bitcoin’s price typically reaches its peak around the same time.” It should be noted that although this has been true for some of the tops, the 2021 peak took months to form after the metric peaked.

At the time of writing, Bitcoin is floating around $62,200, up more than 5% over the past week.

US House Opposes SEC’s Crypto Policy With New Resolution


								The US House of Representatives has voted for a resolution to overturn the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC)’s 2022 bulletin on crypto custodian accounting.
US President Joe Biden released a statement opposing the resolution and revealing a possible veto if the bill passes the Senate.

Democrats And Republicans Join Forces Against The SEC
On May 8, 21 Democrat House Representatives joined 207 Republican Representatives to vote in favor of H.J.Res.109 to nullify the Staff Accounting Bulletin (SAB) 121. The bulletin requires all custodians of cryptocurrencies and other digital assets to recognize these assets as a liability in their accounting books.
As reported by Bitcoinist, the rule has prevented US banks from holding Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies as it made their crypto business “non-viable.” Republican Congressman Mike Flood argued that “the SEC’s accounting standards for firms that custody crypto are unfair and hinder banks looking to provide such services.”


Wednesday’s vote was passed with 228 representatives in favor and 182 opposing it. The bill now awaits the Senate’s vote to be passed to the President’s desk. If approved, the resolution would allow financial institutions to hold Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies under viable requirements.
Fox Business Journalist Elizabeth Terret asserted that the bipartisan decision saw a “larger number of supporting House Democrats than expected.” However, the journalist considers that the bill “likely won’t pass the Senate or the President’s desk.”
SAB 121 has been greatly criticized by important figures like Patrick McHenry, the Chairman of the Financial Services Committee.
On Wednesday, the Committee’s Chair called the bulletin “one of the most glaring examples of the regulatory overreach that has defined Gary Gensler’s tenure at the SEC.” During his speech on the House floor, Chair McHenry remarked his support for the resolution, stating:

This bipartisan resolution is an essential effort to protect consumers and foster innovation in digital asset markets. It’s also critical to stop the SEC’s regulatory power grabs and efforts to circumvent the Administrative Procedure Act.

Senator Cynthia Lummis has also expressed disagreement with the “unnecessary” SAB 121 rule on different occasions. On May 1, the pro-crypto senator criticized the US government’s “overreach” on the industry, revealing her concerns over the Department of Justice (DOJ) “hyper-aggressive” arguments against the sector.
President Biden In Favor Of SEC’s Crypto Crackdown
After the news of the favorable vote by the US House Representatives, the White House addressed the matter. According to the statement, Biden’s administration “strongly opposes” the resolution’s passage.

The president considers the bill “disruptive” against the SEC’s “work to protect investors in crypto-asset markets and to safeguard the broader financial system.”
Moreover, the statement claims that the SEC’s ability to ensure appropriate regulations in the future could be “constrained” by invoking the Congressional Review Act.
The White House considers that “limiting” the SEC’s ability to regulate digital assets “would introduce substantial financial instability and market uncertainty.” Ultimately, the statement affirms that President Biden would veto the resolution if passed by the Senate.

                        Bitcoin mining firm Marathon Digital reportedly battled against “operational challenges” to produce record financial results in the first quarter of 2024.In its first-quarter earnings report, the firm reported producing 2,811 Bitcoins during the first quarter of 2024, compared to 4,242 in the last quarter of 2023, a decline of 33.73%.Marathon Digital reported revenues increased 223% to $165.2 million in the first quarter of 2024 from $51.1 million in the first quarter of 2023. The firms’ energized hash rate which measures the computational power of a blockchain network, increased 142% to 27.8 EH/s in the first quarter of 2024 from 11.5 EH/s in the first quarter of 2023.Marathon Digital shared trading under the ticker “MARA” were down 2.19% at $19.56 at market close on Thursday.“During the first quarter of 2024, we doubled the size of our portfolio of digital asset compute, launched our first products and services to support the Bitcoin ecosystem, and we battled against operational challenges to produce record financial results,” said Fred Thiel, Marathon’s chairman and chief executive officer, a press release.Thiel explained in less than four months the mining firm initiated, closed, and integrated the acquisitions of its first three sites. Due to this, the firm doubled the size of its portfolio to 1.1 gigawatts of capacity, 54% of which is directly owned and operated by Marathon Digital.The firm said it had secured its first paying customers for MARA firmware and began building a sales pipeline for its two-phase immersion system.
HODL Strategy Helps Firm Gain Momentum
“Despite the operational challenges we faced in the first quarter, we were able to leverage our agility to redistribute equipment to newly acquired sites amidst ongoing repairs,” said Thiel. “When combined with our HODL strategy, these actions allowed us to capitalize on Bitcoin’s positive momentum and produce record financial results for the quarter,” added Thiel.The firm went on to grow its topline to $165.2 million, improved net income to a record $337.2 million, and generated adjusted EBITDA of $528.8 million.
Mining Companies Experience Production Decline
Earlier this year, several public mining companies reported decreases in Bitcoin production ranging from 6% to 12% for April following the halving event. Major Bitcoin miners, including Bitfarms, Cipher, CleanSpark, Core Scientific, Riot, and Terawulf, were all affected, according to a report from The Miner Mag.However, the report said that the robust Bitcoin fee market briefly mitigated the impact of the halving on these companies. Hut 8, one of the prominent Bitcoin mining companies in North America, has reported a significant decline in its proprietary production for April. In their monthly update released on Monday, Hut 8 disclosed that they mined 148 BTC with their proprietary mining fleet during April, marking a 36% decrease compared to March.

Solana NFTs: Traders surge 111%, but sales are down - Why? - AMBCrypto



The number of NFT traders on Solana recently rallied to a multi-month high.
The steady decline in SOL’s price has led to a fall in NFT sales volume.

The daily count of non-fungible token [NFT] traders on Solana [SOL] climbed to a multi-month high on the 8th of May, data from CryptoSlam showed.
According to the NFT data tracker, 123,426 traders executed the sale of at least one Solana-based NFT on that day. This marked a 111% rally from the 58,405 NFT traders on the network recorded the previous day.
Source: CryptoSlam
However, despite the surge in NFT traders count, NFT sales volume on Solana cratered by 16% on the 8th of May. That day, the USD value of all Solana-based NFTs sold was $3.01 million. 
On the 7th of May, it was above $3.5 million.
This decline in sales volume is due to the steady decline in SOL’s value in the past few days. According to CoinMarketCap’s data, the coin’s value fell by 7% between the 7th and the 8th of May. 
At press time, SOL traded at $143.04. 
While a decline in SOL’s price can make minting and buying NFTs on Solana more affordable, it might not translate to the same total spending as before.
Also, with SOL’s low price action, investors who bought SOL-based NFTs for potential appreciation in SOL’s value might become hesitant to sell.
 This could lead to fewer high-value NFT purchases, impacting the overall sales volume.
State of the NFT market
An assessment of the performance of the general NFT ecosystem revealed a decline in the past 30 days, mirroring the downtrend in the general cryptocurrency market. 
According to CoinGecko’s data, global cryptocurrency market capitalization has plunged by 15% in the last month. At press time, this was $2.4 trillion.
According to NFTGo’s data, NFT sales volume during that period totaled $488 million and declined by 29%.
Due to the decline in trading activity, NFT market capitalization plummeted. At $17.28 billion at press time, this dropped by 15 % in the past 30 days.

During that period, the NFT trader count fell by 9.5%.
Per NFTGo’s data, the total number of unique addresses that bought or sold at least one NFT from any of the NFT collections tracked over the last month was 107,000.

Sui's zkLogin Now Adds Multi-signature Recovery And Support For Apple Accounts - Coincu



	

Key Points:




Sui’s zkLogin introduces multi-signature recovery and Apple account support, enhancing user options and account recovery capabilities.



The integration of multi-signature recovery improves account recoverability.



These updates reflect Sui’s commitment to simplifying Web3 adoption and bridging the gap for non-crypto users.




Sui Foundation, in a recent announcement on its official blog, unveiled two significant enhancements to its social login basic tool, zkLogin. 





Sui’s zkLogin Introduces Multi-Signature Support



The updates include multi-signature recovery and support for Apple accounts, providing users with expanded options and improved account recovery mechanisms.



Initially introduced last year with support for Google, Twitch, and Facebook accounts, the integration with Apple of Sui’s zkLogin offers users the convenience of consolidating all their social logins under one platform, particularly beneficial for iOS users seeking seamless integration with Sui wallet creation within iPhone applications.



The introduction of multi-signature (multi-sig) recovery presents a novel approach to account recovery, prioritizing both security and user accessibility. With zkLogin’s reliance on the application client ID and issuer, such as Google, multi-sig significantly enhances account recoverability, ensuring users can regain access even if the original application or credential issuer becomes inactive.




Sui Foundation’s Commitment to Web3



Sui’s concerted efforts to onboard new users to Web3 align with the platform’s mission to bridge the gap between traditional and decentralized technologies. Recognizing the challenge faced by both Sui and other Web3 companies in retaining non-crypto users during initial platform access, Sui’s zkLogin marks a pivotal step towards enhancing user confidence and usability within the Web3 ecosystem.



Through the creation of a multi-sig wallet with zkLogin and an additional private key backup, users can maintain access to their assets in the event of app or credential issuer discontinuation. Moreover, the integration of multi-sig with zkLogin facilitates more intricate use cases, enabling builders to incorporate up to 10 zkLogin accounts from various credential providers with customizable weights and thresholds, thereby expanding the tool’s versatility and utility.

BlockFi Shut Down Will Take Place In May, Users Need To Withdraw Asset Before April 28 - Coincu



	

Key Points:




BlockFi shut down will take place at the end of May, and Coinbase will be reliant on it for distribution.



Clients who missed withdrawal deadlines will have their crypto holdings transferred to Coinbase instead of being liquidated to cash.



The partnership ensures continued access to crypto assets, with BlockFi highlighting Coinbase’s involvement as crucial for facilitating future crypto distributions.




BlockFi, a crypto lender undergoing liquidation, has announced plans to close its web platform by the end of May 2024.





BlockFi Shut Down Will Take Place in Partnership with Coinbase for Distribution



In a bid to facilitate the withdrawal process for its clients, BlockFi will be teaming up with Coinbase, a leading cryptocurrency exchange, as its primary distribution partner.



BlockFi shut down comes as part of its bankruptcy proceedings, ensuring that clients with BlockFi Interest Accounts (BIAs), retail loans, and private accounts can still access their funds. Eligible customers who have not withdrawn their crypto holdings by April 28 or completed identity verification by May 10 will have their assets transferred to Coinbase instead of being liquidated to cash.



Continued Access to Crypto Assets Through The Partnership



Clients will have the option to access their funds in kind through their existing or newly created Coinbase accounts. Those unable to create a Coinbase account will receive their funds in cash. BlockFi has emphasized that it has not partnered with any other crypto companies for distributions and warns users of potential scams.




The partnership between BlockFi and Coinbase aims to enable seamless access to crypto holdings during BlockFi shut down. Instructions will be provided to users by both companies, with future distributions potentially facilitated through Coinbase by the plan administrator in BlockFi’s bankruptcy case.

Starknet Foundation Launches $5 Million Seed Grants Program to Boost Final-Stage Blockchain Projects



                    

The Starknet Foundation recently unveiled a significant $5 million Seed Grants Program, designated in USDC, to propel the development of nascent projects on its network. 



This initiative is set to provide vital financial backing to at least 200 emerging teams, each receiving $25,000. 




The focus is on aiding projects in their final stages, helping them overcome the “last mile” challenge to successfully launch on Starknet. 



Starknet operates as an Ethereum layer-2 scaling solution employing zero-knowledge rollup technology, which has been gaining traction among developers.



Diego Oliva, CEO of the Starknet Foundation, emphasized the rationale behind this substantial financial commitment. 




He explained, “We’ve been listening carefully to devs [developers] and hearing about the main challenges they face. 



“We are talking about people with amazing creativity and vision who need support with that ever-hard ‘last mile’ to get a project over the line and into production. 



“So we responded with this program, which is intended, very directly and with minimal bureaucracy, to address this.” 



This quote highlights the foundation’s strategic approach to foster a robust development environment and streamline project completion.

Tether Criticizes Deutsche Bank’s Research on Stablecoins


							

Deutsche Bank Research analysts recently released a paper on stablecoins launched since 1800.



The analysts conclude that most pegged coins failed, with only 14% surviving.



Tether criticizes the researchers, claiming they failed to produce concrete data to support their arguments.




In a recent study, Deutsche Bank Research analysts concluded that most stablecoins failed, with only 14% surviving. Raising concerns regarding the future of stablecoins, the researchers posited, “Some may survive, although most will likely fail.”



Stablecoins are digital currencies pegged to another asset like fiat currency, gold, etc. As these types of currencies are stable, most investors depend on them in the highly volatile crypto market.









The analysts surveyed nearly 334 pegged currencies launched since 1800. They asserted that only a very few currently exist among the total stablecoins. They added that the successful stablecoins boasted three features that the failed stablecoins lacked: credibility, reserve backing, and tightly controlled systems.



As per the research, 49% of the stablecoins failed, existing only for 8 to 10 years. The analysts argued that “macroeconomic factors are key to determining a peg sustainability.” Marion Laboure, Senior Strategist at Deutsche Bank Research, stated, “Issues around governance and speculative forces could also indicate when there’s a possibility of de-pegging.” He added,




 “We chose to compare stablecoins to peg currencies because historically their similarities make them a close proxy as both are pegged currencies. Both require ample reserves and credibility from issuers, are exposed to speculative forces, and the majority of both stablecoins and historical currency pegs track the USD.” 




However, Tether, the issuer of stablecoin giant USDT, raised its voice against the Deutsche Bank Research report, claiming that the analysts failed to produce “concrete data” supporting their arguments. While the researchers pinpointed Terraform Labs’ TerraUSD as an example of the fall of stablecoins, Tether commented, “Its comparison to Terra, an algorithmic stablecoin, is misleading and irrelevant to the discussion on reserve-backed coins.”

                        Embattled crypto lender BlockFi announced Thursday that it plans to close its web platform this month, and is partnering with Coinbase to distribute funds to clients.The New Jersey-based firm said its Coinbase partnership will allow eligible BlockFi Interest Account, Retail Loan, and Private Clients to withdraw their crypto holdings.BlockFi filed for bankruptcy in Nov. 2022 after FTX’s collapse. CEO Zac Prince, who testified as a government witness in Bankman-Fried’s criminal trial, claims the FTX founder’s actions directly caused BlockFi’s bankruptcy.
Missed BlockFi’s Withdrawal Deadline? You Can Still Recover Your Crypto
In 2023, BlockFi announced it was shutting down and planned to return customers’ crypto holdings. The deadline for most customers to request withdrawals was April 28, 2024.On Thursday, the lender told clients that since the deadline to withdraw their digital assets from the current estate distribution has passed, clients will receive instructions on how to set up a Coinbase account. Through this method, they can withdraw their digital assets if they have an existing or new approved Coinbase account.The company is also giving another chance to those who missed the withdrawal deadline. They will still have the option to withdraw from BlockFi’s platform. Those who do not establish an approved Coinbase account may have their assets liquidated into cash and distributed to them accordingly.
BlockFi Tells Customers To Download Important Documents Before Platform Closure
The plan administrator will have the power to use Coinbase for upcoming distribution rounds, which may involve distributions from recovered funds from FTX. Without this capability, the administrator would be limited to distributing cash for subsequent distributions.BlockFi said it does not plan to collaborate with any additional providers for cryptocurrency distributions. Consequently, it cautioned investors to remain vigilant against potential scam attempts from third-party entities. BlockFi has previously been the target of fraudulent activity, where claimants received deceptive emails resembling legitimate communications, falsely promising immediate withdrawals of their remaining balances.Customers were further encouraged to retrieve their transaction history, tax documents, and any other pertinent information from BlockFi before the shutdown occurs.

                        An attacker involved in a $68 million address poisoning scam has exhibited a gesture of goodwill by returning $153,000 worth of Ether to the victim.The address-poisoning attack initially saw the attacker tricking a user into transferring $68 million worth of Wrapped Bitcoin (WBTC), which has taken a new twist with the recent kind-hearted act of returning a fraction of the stolen funds.
Attacker Expressed Willingness To Negotiate
The attacker, operating under the alias “FakePhishing327990” on Etherscan, sent $153,000 Ether to the victim, accompanied by a message expressing willingness to negotiate and seeking communication via Telegram.The Victim contacting the address poisoning attacker Source: EtherscanBlockchain data reveals that the victim, identified by their account ending in 8fD5, initiated communication with the attacker. The victim proposed a resolution in which the attacker would return 90% of the stolen funds in exchange for a 10% bounty and a commitment to refrain from legal action. The victim emphasized the inevitability of tracing the funds and provided a deadline for the decision.Subsequently, another account controlled by the attacker, ending in 72F1, responded by sending 51 Ether to the victim. This symbolized a fraction of the stolen funds returned as a demonstration of goodwill. The accompanying message reiterated the attacker’s willingness to negotiate and requested the victim’s Telegram username for further communication.The negotiation unfolds against the address poisoning scam, in which the attacker utilizes a smart contract to deceive the victim into transferring 1,155 WBTC by exploiting the appearance of similarity between addresses.This sophisticated tactic, known as an “address poisoning attack,” involves spamming victims with transactions that mimic their own, ultimately leading to costly errors. Security experts caution users to scrutinize transaction details meticulously, particularly the sending address, to mitigate the risks associated with such attacks.
Phishing Attacks On Rise
An NFT trader recently fell victim to a phishing scam, losing over $145,000 worth of tokens. The trader, known as “tatis.eth,” was targeted by an attacker named “PinkDrainer,” who stole three valuable BAYC NFTs from the victim’s wallet.BAYC, short for Bored Ape Yacht Club, is a collection of highly valued Ethereum-based NFTs featuring unique cartoon ape designs. The stolen NFTs were transferred to a phishing address and sold for 48.5 ETH.This incident is part of a broader trend of phishing scams targeting cryptocurrency users, with notable losses reported in the first two months of 2024.According to Scam Sniffer data, over $104 million worth of cryptocurrencies has been lost to phishing attacks in this period, with a significant portion coming from the Ethereum ecosystem.

Zombie Coin (ZOMCOIN) to Rally 8,000% After Solana Launch, Looks to Challenge Shiba Inu and DogeCoin



                    

Zombie Coin (ZOMCOIN) could become a viral memecoin, like Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE).



Zombie Coin (ZOMCOIN), a Solana memecoin that was launched today, is aiming to challenge other memecoin giants, such as Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE).




Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Zombie Coin presents a similar opportunity.



Zombie Coin has market cap below $15,000 at the moment, meaning that when it just reaches a modest market cap of $200,000-$500,000, early investors would generate returns of 2,000%-5,000% in a matter of days or hours.



The exciting memecoin is poised to rally 8,000% in the coming two days, and Zombie Coin could potentially reach a multi-million dollar market cap within a few weeks.




Currently, Zombie Coin can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jupiter and Raydium, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days.



To buy Zombie Coin on these platforms, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Zombie Coin by entering its contract address – FbkoYsCAPbcyJkSoqXTxDKKoGQrYoqgtdLf9GBEqy2vr – in the receiving field.



In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price.



If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner.




The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum.



This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like ZOMCOIN.

TON Phishing Message Fools Users With Cheap 5000 USDT - Coincu



	

Key Points:




Slow Mist founder exposes TON phishing messages, which users tricked into believing they receive cheap USDT via TON message comments.



TON’s increased user base attracts scammers who are exploiting its asynchronous nature and smart contract functionality.




A recent revelation by Slow Mist founder sheds light on a new phishing scam leveraging the Telegram Open Network (TON) transfer mechanism to deceive users into receiving seemingly inexpensive USDT tokens.





Slow Mist Founder Exposes TON Phishing Message



The TON phishing messages scam operates through misleading message comments within the TON blockchain, with content suggesting the receipt of substantial amounts of USDT, such as “Received +5,000 USDT.” However, users fall victim to the illusion of receiving such funds, unaware of the deception.



The TON blockchain, renowned for its asynchronous nature and smart contract functionality, facilitates data transmission among its users. The surge in TON’s user base, driven by the growing interest in blockchain technology, has unfortunately led to the proliferation of fraudulent schemes like TON phishing messages.



TON, an integral component of the Web3 ecosystem, aims to redefine decentralized experiences beyond DeFi, dApps, and DAOs. With developers actively collaborating to support Telegram‘s vast user base exceeding 700 million, the TON Foundation plays a pivotal role in fostering this innovative landscape.




Crypto Community Grapples with Persistent Phishing Scams



Crypto phishing scams, a persistent menace in the digital asset realm, exploit unsuspecting individuals by masquerading as legitimate entities and offering false promises of free tokens or coins.



Amidst this backdrop, the crypto community grapples with the aftermath of various scams, including the recent ZKasino fraud case, resulting in investors losing an estimated $33 million in digital assets. Dutch authorities have taken action, apprehending a suspect linked to the ZKasino scam on April 29, signaling efforts to combat fraudulent activities within the industry.

Jack Dorsey says Bitcoin will be worth 'at least a million' by 2030

Twitter co-founder Jack Dorsey says the price of Bitcoin (BTC) could reach a price of at least $1 million by the year 2030, adding that its value could grow even further from that point onwards. Speaking in a May 9 interview with journalist Mike Solana on Pirate Wires, Dorsey offered a bullish outlook for the long-term price action of Bitcoin as well as providing further context behind his abrupt departure from the board of BlueSky — a decentralized Twitter alternative he helped launch in 2019. Dorsey told Solana he believes Bitcoin's price could reach “at least a million” by 2030 adding that that it most likely “hits that number and goes beyond.”Dorsey — now the head of the financial services firm Block — noted that Bitcoin’s price isn’t actually the most interesting aspect of Bitcoin, and instead pointed to the collaborative nature of the ecosystem and the way it incentivizes collective efforts to enhance the network.“The most amazing thing about Bitcoin, apart from the founding story, is anyone who works on it, or gets paid in it, or buys it for themselves — everyone who puts any effort in to make it better — is making the entire ecosystem better, which makes the price go up.”“It's a fascinating ecosystem and movement, more than anything else,” he said before adding, “It taught me a lot.”Source: Mike SolanaRelated: Bitcoin could soon ‘BLOW higher’ on bullish candle hammer: Glassnode execsDorsey raised eyebrows earlier this week when it was confirmed he would be departing the board of Bluesky, a decentralized social network he helped start as an alternative to Twitter.He said that Bluesky was “literally repeating all the mistakes [Twitter] made,” adding that it is not a protocol that could be deemed truly decentralized. “It’s another app,” he said.Dorsey originally envisioned Bluesky as an open-source protocol that Twitter and other social media platforms could build on top of, separating the protocol layer from the application layer to reduce censorship risks.However, he said the firm started behaving more like a traditional company that began pushing for moderation tools. “Everything we wanted around decentralization, everything we wanted in terms of an open source protocol, suddenly became a company with VCs and a board. That's not what I wanted, that's not what I intended to help create.”Dorsey, who has since deleted his Bluesky account, said the platform with Nostr, an anonymous, open protocol with no company or centralized control, aligned more with his goals of censorship resistance.In a note to shareholders on May 2, Dorsey said that his fintech firm Block will flip 10% of its gross profit from Bitcoin-related products back into buying more BTC every month.On May 1, it was reported that US federal prosecutors were probing Block after documents alleged compliance violations at the firm’s payment divisions, Square and Cash App.Magazine: US enforcement agencies are turning up the heat on crypto-related crime

Franklin Templeton: Friend.Tech and SocialFi Fuel Base Growth


Franklin Templeton, a prominent asset manager with a vast portfolio exceeding $1.4 trillion, recently turned its analytical gaze towards Base—a layer-2 (L2) blockchain solution crafted by the crypto exchange Coinbase.
Launched to the public on August 9, 2023, Base has swiftly climbed the ranks within the blockchain community. Particularly, it has caught the eye for its innovative approach in the Social Finance (SocialFi) domain.
Base’s Emergence as a SocialFi Contender
Franklin Templeton’s analysis reveals that roughly 46% of all transactions on Base are intertwined with SocialFi applications. This marks it as a pivotal sector for Base’s adoption and subsequent growth. Franklin Templeton highlights Friend.Tech as a prime example.
Friend.Tech is a mobile-only application that capitalizes on monetizing social interactions on its platform. It has recently made headlines due to the launch of its second version (Friend.Tech V2) and a native token airdrop—FRIEND.

The FRIEND token is claimed to be solely owned by its user base. It boasts a market cap of around $200 million, highlighting the robust community engagement and investor confidence in Base’s ecosystem.
Furthermore, Franklin Templeton outlined that integrating SocialFi applications directly with Coinbase’s expansive user base provides Base a unique advantage.


“With the support of the Coinbase platform, Base has a strong combination of SocialFi applications and direct integration with Coinbase users, positioning itself well to capture a material share of SocialFi activity and remain a leader in the Ethereum L2 sector going forward,” Franklin Templeton analysts wrote.

Base uses “optimistic rollups” to speed up transactions and cut costs. It batches transactions off the main Ethereum blockchain. Then, it consolidates these transactions and finalizes them on the Ethereum mainnet.
This process allows Base to reduce costs significantly while maintaining Ethereum’s high-security standards. Thus, Base stands out among other L2 solutions.
Compared to other L2 solutions like Arbitrum and Optimism, Base has shown unprecedented growth. L2BEAT data shows that Base’s total value locked (TVL) increased by over 630% from $742.63 million to $5.45 billion in the year-to-date (YTD) time frame. Meanwhile, Arbitrum, the top L2 solution with a $16.03 billion TVL, saw only a roughly 47% increase during the same time frame.

Trump-Inspired MAGA Coin Leaves Parody Biden Memecoin In The Dust With 23% Weekly Gain As Ex-President Warms Up More To Crypto - Benzinga

A cryptocurrency themed around former U.S. President Donald Trump surged this week as the firebrand leader stepped up his endorsement of digital currencies. A rival coin, however, saw its fortunes tank.What Happened: MAGA Coin TRUMP/USD saw a 5% increase in the last 24 hours and a 23% rise since the beginning of the week, as per data from Coinmarketcap.This uptick coincided with Trump’s amplified crypto-friendly rhetoric, particularly notable at a recent NFT event where he emphatically endorsed cryptocurrencies, even proclaiming, “If you’re in favor of crypto, you better vote for Trump.” Santiment data confirms a surge in Trump’s mentions across major crypto-centric social platforms, reflecting his growing advocacy for digital assets.See Also: Best 10 Altcoins In May 2024Conversely, mentions of President Joe Biden escalated amidst concerns over potential stringent crypto regulations. This negative sentiment impacted Jeo Boden BODEN/USD, a cryptocurrency parodying the incumbent president, which experienced an 18.88% drop in the last 24 hours and a 28% decrease over the week.Why It Matters: MAGA Coin, inspired by the “Make America Great Again” movement, has skyrocketed 25x year-to-date, signaling the potential rise of a new category of political finance cryptocurrencies, colloquially termed “Politi-Fi.” This trend underscores Trump’s strategic alignment with the growing crypto demographic in the U.S., as highlighted in a Visual Capitalist report revealing approximately 53 million Americans as crypto owners in 2023, the highest in absolute numbers and the third-highest by population share.Since its launch on Aug. 11, 2023, MAGA has surged by an astonishing 35,211%, while BODEN, launched on March 10, 2024, has seen a 768% increase.Read Next: Donald Trump Says ‘You Better Vote’ For Him If You’re Pro-Crypto: But Has He Always Been ‘Fine With It’?Photo via Shutterstock

Can Crypto Markets March Higher When $1.1B Bitcoin Options Expire Today?


																Aside from a minor mid-week dip, crypto markets have been relatively inactive in the past several days and continue to trade sideways.
However, around 18,280 Bitcoin options contracts are set to expire on May 10, which may inject some volatility.
The notional value for this week’s batch of expiring BTC contracts is around $1.15 billion, according to Deribit. The batch is slightly smaller than last week’s expiry event.
Bitcoin Options Expiry
The put/call ratio for this week’s BTC options is 0.64, which means that more calls, or long contracts, are expiring than puts or shorts.
The longs are also dominating in open interest (OI) with almost $700 million at the $70,000 and $100,000 strike prices. Open interest refers to the number or value of contracts that have yet to be settled.




OI for put contracts is also starting to creep up with around $360 million at the $50,000 strike price, according to Deribit.
Overall, the open interest for Bitcoin call options is more than double the OI for put options, indicating bullish trader sentiment.
Call options give the right to purchase the underlying asset at a predetermined price on or before a specific date.
Moreover, trading firms like QCP Capital and Paradigm have observed revived demand for upside call options, including buyers closing existing positions to roll into higher strike calls expiring in July and September.

In addition to today’s batch of Bitcoin options, 276,000 Ethereum contracts are also set to expire.
These have a notional value of around $840 million and a put/call ratio of 0.74. There is a lot of OI, around $636 million, at the $3,600 strike price, indicating that Ethereum derivatives traders are also bullish.
Crypto Market Outlook
Crypto markets have gained 2.1% on the day to reach $2.45 trillion in total capitalization. However, they have consolidated around this level since mid-April with very little movement in either direction.
Bitcoin dipped below $61,000 on May 9 but has recovered to tap $63,000 during the Friday morning Asian trading session. The asset has been down trending since its all-time high in mid-March and has lost 15% since then.
Ethereum prices hit an intraday low of $2,953 but have since recovered to reach $3,032 at the time of writing.
The altcoins are mostly in the green at the moment, with larger gains for Solana (SOL) and Toncoin (TON).

                        Tech leader Jack Dorsey is betting big on Bitcoin, forecasting a price explosion to over $1 million by 2030.As Pirates Wires’ Mike Solana asked for his take on Bitcoin’s future value, Dorsey said: “I don’t know. Over… at least a million. I do think it hits that number and goes beyond.”Still, the crypto asset’s price itself takes a backseat for Dorsey, who reiterated his core fascination with Bitcoin lies in other aspects.“The most amazing thing about Bitcoin, apart from the founding story, is anyone who works on it, or gets paid in it, or buys it for themselves — everyone who puts any effort in to make it better — is making the entire ecosystem better, which makes the price go up,” he said in the interview published Thursday. “It’s a fascinating ecosystem and movement, more than anything else. It taught me a lot.”Dorsey isn’t alone in foreseeing Bitcoin reaching remarkable levels. Ark Invest CEO Cathie Wood also sees a $1m valuation for Bitcoin by 2030. Additionally, Jurrien Timmer, director of global macro at Fidelity Investments, has projected a seven-figure range for Bitcoin estimating it to fall between $1m and $10m in 2030.
Dorsey Ditches Bluesky For Repeating Twitter’s ‘Mistakes’
This week, Dorsey, the one-time Twitter CEO, revealed he stepped down from Bluesky’s board. The platform, envisioned in 2019, aims to be a decentralized social media alternative.“Everything we wanted around decentralization, everything we wanted in terms of an open source protocol, suddenly became a company with VCs and a board,” he told Pirates Wire. “That’s not what I wanted, that’s not what I intended to help create.”He attributed his departure to Bluesky’s path, saying it was “literally repeating all the mistakes [Twitter] made as a company.”Dorsey further revealed his true focus lies with Nostr, another decentralized platform challenging Twitter. He said he wanted to support Nostr’s development as a genuine open-source protocol.
Jack Dorsey’s Block Announces Strategic Monthly Bitcoin Purchases
Dorsey is currently head of payments firm Block, which is doubling down on Bitcoin. Last week, the firm announced a new strategy to invest 10% of its Bitcoin product profits into buying more Bitcoin every month.Block was one of the first public companies to invest in Bitcoin, with a $220m investment in 2020. The company’s Bitcoin holdings have surged 160% to reach $573m by the end of Q1 2024.

Harvest Plans To Open Bitcoin ETF To Mainland China


								Harvest Global Investments, a Chinese fund house and one of the issuers of Hong Kong’s first spot Bitcoin and Ethereum exchange-traded funds (ETFs), has confirmed plans to potentially open these funds to mainland Chinese investors through the Hong Kong Stock Connect. This development could vastly expand the investor base and significantly impact the cryptocurrency market in Asia.
Harvest CEO Eyes Mainland Access For HK Bitcoin ETF
Currently, Harvest Global offers Bitcoin and Ether ETFs in Hong Kong, with these products enabling direct investment in the respective cryptocurrencies. The possibility of including these ETFs in the ETF Connect scheme, part of the broader Stock Connect initiative launched in 2014 to link Hong Kong with mainland Chinese exchanges, was discussed by Harvest CEO Han Tongli at the Bitcoin Asia conference.
Han stated, “We don’t rule out applying for our ETFs to be included in the connect programme, as long as everything goes smooth and well in the next two years.”

The move to integrate crypto investments into the Stock Connect could be a significant step, given the previously restricted access to such products for mainland investors. Hong Kong’s approach to cryptocurrency regulation has been more open compared to mainland China, where most commercial crypto activities are banned, but trading and ownership by individuals remain a gray area legally.
Despite the innovative nature of these spot crypto ETFs and their ability to offer direct exposure to cryptocurrencies rather than derivatives or stocks of companies related to digital currencies, the initial trading volumes have been underwhelming compared to the US market. According to Han, this is partly due to the market’s cautious view of Hong Kong’s virtual asset policies and its implications for the future of these ETFs.

Han remarked during a panel at the Bitcoin Asia conference that the local market could potentially double the size of the US products, emphasizing the strategic importance of Hong Kong as a more neutral ground with broader appeal in Asia. He attributed the slow start to various factors, including the market’s doubts about Hong Kong’s commitment to becoming a crypto hub, stating, “People are still skeptical about Hong Kong’s status as a special [administrative] region. It’s located in China, and many people don’t want to see Hong Kong become more successful for whatever reason.”
In his discussion, Han also highlighted the competitive advantages of Hong Kong’s crypto products, like the possibility for in-kind subscriptions — buying ETFs directly with bitcoin and ether — and temporary waiving of management fees to attract investors. These features, along with the potential inclusion in the Stock Connect, are seen as critical to gaining traction and establishing Hong Kong as a key player in the global cryptocurrency market.
At press time, BTC traded at $62,754.

Russian Opposition Leader Mark Feygin Launches Blockchain-Based Referendum on Vladimir Putin’s Election Win

The results of this effort would, of course, have no legal weight in Russia and would not end Putin's presidency per se, but the referendum could, in theory, give a public relations boost to efforts to oust him. And it gives Russians a way to voice criticism in a nation where the consequences of dissent can be high; opposition leader Alexei Navalny recently died while jailed in an Arctic penal colony.

President Joe Biden is trying hard to 'kill crypto', says Cardano founder

Cardano founder Charles Hoskinson has lashed out at United States President Joe Biden, claiming that he’s making a concerted effort to kill the crypto industry in the United States.In a May 9 video posted to X, Hoskinson said it was “unambiguously clear” the Biden administration is trying its best to “destroy the American cryptocurrency industry.”He said that over the past few years, the U.S. government had “hurt [the crypto] industry in every way possible,” citing the restricted access to bank accounts, the Securities and Exchange Commission's policy of regulation by enforcement — and most recently — the White House "obstructing" the legislative process. “A vote for Biden is a vote against the American cryptocurrency industry.” Hoksinson’s comments came following a statement from President Biden's office, which said he would veto legislation looking to overturn SEC guidelines that discourage banks from custodying crypto assets. On May 8, the White House said it “strongly opposes” members of the House of Representatives that later passed a joint resolution to overturn SAB 121.The White House claimed nullifying SAB 121 would hinder the SEC’s ability to “protect investors in crypto-asset markets and to safeguard the broader financial system.”Source: Charles HoskinsonAdditionally, Hoskinson lashed out at the SEC for leveraging antiquated legislation that he said shouldn’t apply to new and emerging asset classes. “The Securities Exchange Act passed in 1933, to say that it is sufficient to regulate assets that came 90 years later is an absurd statement.” He cited Switzerland, Singapore, and Dubai as jurisdictions that welcome crypto companies and have reaped the benefits of millions of dollars worth of investments, stemming from the 3,000 firms that “probably would have domiciled in the United States had our crypto policy been reasonable.” Related: President Biden says he would veto resolution countermanding SEC crypto ruleA user on Twitter pushed back on Hoskinson’s Biden-specific claims, saying that the previous Trump Administration hadn’t exactly been open to crypto either. Hoskinson didn’t mince words in response, saying this stance was “completely wrong.”“The [Trump] administration had its issues but mostly ignored our industry. The Biden administration has engaged in a coordinated effort to kill crypto.”In April, Cointelegraph reported that the Biden Administration asked Congress to target the American Bitcoin mining industry, citing China as an example for the U.S. to follow.Magazine: What do crypto market makers actually do?

Altcoins will bottom in early summer before bull run - Analyst

Bitcoin (BTC) aside, the cryptocurrency market could find its local bottom in June, marking the start of the next altcoin bull cycle, according to market analysts. Altcoin bottom could occur in June: analystBased on historical chart patterns, altcoins could be set to find their local price bottom around the beginning of June, according to popular crypto analyst Rekt Capital, who wrote in a May 8 X post:“Altcoins are following the plan perfectly. Altcoins bottomed in early February. Altcoins sold off around the BTC Halving. Altcoins to bottom early summer.”Altcoin hype cycles. Source: Rekt CapitalThe altcoin market took a beating during the past month. The market cap of altcoins, excluding the 10 largest cryptocurrencies, fell over 21% during the previous month to $265 billion.Altcoin market cap, Source: TradingViewDespite the monthly slump, the altcoin market cap is still up over 24% year-to-date (YTD), and over 167% during the past year.Altcoin sentiment is historically correlated with Bitcoin price. Altcoins could find their local bottom around June, as market sentiment and Bitcoin price remains subdued by decreasing inflows from U.S. spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs), according to Alex Onufriychuk, blockchain advisor and coach at QUBIC Labs Accelerator. He told Cointelegraph:“There is a possibility that could find their local bottom by June due to the lack of sufficient new liquidity from Bitcoin ETFs in the U.S. and Hong Kong. This indicates that the consolidation period may be prolonged.”Related: Did XRP price just bottom against Bitcoin?Bitcoin breakout will spark altcoin bull cycle: NansenDespite seeing a potential local bottom, an altcoin bull run would first require Bitcoin price to break out to the upside, according to Aurelie Barthere, principal research analyst at Nansen, who told Cointelegraph:"Altcoins are high beta crypto, they are successful when the sentiment is very bullish. Since mid-March, the sentiment among crypto investors is less exuberant. As BTC price consolidates around the 20-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA), there is more volatility in Alts. We need a break above and a clear resumption of BTC uptrend for alts to outperform."BTC price has been posting lower highs since mid March. But many analysts argue that this is a healthy period of consolidation after the halving. Moreover, the charts hint at a multi-month bull flag taking shape for new all-time highs later this year. BTC/USDT, 1-day chart. Source: TradingviewSince altcoin sentiment is strongly related to Bitcoin price, finding a local bottom wouldn’t necessarily translate into an altcoin rally, wrote QUBIC Labs’ Onufriychuk:“Even if altcoins find their local bottom around June, it does not necessarily mean that a bull run will start. For a significant turnaround, more fundamental changes are required, such as increased retail and institutional investment and favorable regulatory developments, given the scarcity of new liquidity and heavy reliance on institutional reinvestment into newer projects.”On the monthly chart, 10 out of 12 moving averages (MA) are flashing a buy signal for the top altcoins, such as Ether (ETH), which has struggled.

“While some may survive, most will likely fail, particularly due to the lack of transparency in stablecoin operations and vulnerability to speculative sentiment.”
The research analyzed the collapse of TerraUSD stablecoin, leaving a ripple effect on the entire crypto market. “These incidents highlight the volatility and risks associated with stablecoins, and the need for greater transparency and regulation in the cryptocurrency market,” the report read.Further, Deutsche Bank criticized Tether – a dominant stablecoin – questioning its solvency and its industry standard for crypto derivatives.
“A ‘Tether peso moment’ could cause significant losses, negatively impacting leveraged traders and causing severe repercussions for the entire crypto system.”
Additionally, the report stressed the challenges in constructing stable currency pegs, despite the novelty of cryptocurrencies. “It is likely that we will see much more instability in the years to come,” it added.The German banking giant surveyed over 3,350 consumers in March (550 in France, Germany, Spain, Italy, UK each and 600 in USA), questioning the stability of stablecoins.“Only 18% of consumers expecting them to thrive, while 42% expect them to fade,” the survey found.
Tether Slams Deutsche Bank’s Stablecoin Warning
Notably, the research team wrote that they are concerned about Tether, given its implications amid “monopoly in the stablecoin market.” According to a Bloomberg report, the analysts also pointed out reliance on Tether in the crypto derivatives market.“The 30% de-peg rate among some stablecoins is therefore hardly surprising, and many defunct stablecoins are hard to account for.”Retaliating back to Deutsche Bank’s stablecoin claims, Tether said that the research “lacks clarity and substantial evidence, relying on vague assertions rather than rigorous analysis.”“While it attempts to forecast the decline of stablecoins, it fails to provide concrete data to support its claims.”

Telegram-Linked Toncoin Price Soars, But So Do Scams As Hackers Steal $140K Worth Of Tokens From Unsuspecting Users - Benzinga

Telegram-linked cryptocurrency Toncoin's TON/USD impressive run on the price charts this year has thrilled market participants, but the rising popularity has inadvertently drawn the attention of bad actors as well.What Happened: According to Web3 anti-scam platform Scam Sniffer, an address with a criminal history swindled as many as 22,000 TON tokens from unsuspecting users over the past few days. At the current market price, the stolen amount was worth $140,000. Digging deep into the modus operandi, the on-chain sleuth showed how users are duped into clicking a popup that promises to transfer USDT USDT/USD to their wallets. However, these were nothing but phishing links that ended up emptying their wallets of TON tokens.Similar findings were reported by cybersecurity firm Kaspersky, which unearthed a sophisticated phishing operation active since November 2023 that targeted TON holders. Why It Matters: Toncoin has been one of the crypto market's success stories in 2024, soaring 185% on a year-to-date basis, according to data from Benzinga Pro.According to a report by Santiment last week, Toncoin witnessed the fastest network growth among leading cryptocurrencies over the last six months.  The growth was fueled by social messaging giant Telegram's public support for the project, and its growing utility within the Telegram ecosystem. However, as the network grows in strength, and valuation increases, it would attract the predatory gazes of scammers and phishers, who don't need any second invitation to jump on money-making opportunities. Scam Sniffer reported losses of nearly $300 million due to crypto phishing scams in 2023, and $173 million already as of March. Price Action: At the time of writing, TON was exchanging hands at $6.58, marking double-digit gains of 11% in the last 24 hours.Read Next: If You Invested $1,000 In Bitcoin When Donald Trump Said The Crypto’s Value Was ‘Based On Thin Air,’ Here’s How Much You’d Have NowImage via Shutterstock

Crypto Analyst Says Bullish Cycle Not Over, Predicts $100,000 Bitcoin in Fourth Quarter - But There’s a Catch - The Daily Hodl


								A widely followed crypto trader says that Bitcoin (BTC) could skyrocket to a six-figure price tag in the fourth quarter of 2024.
In a new thread, pseudonymous crypto analyst Altcoin Sherpa tells his 215,900 followers on the social media platform X that the top crypto asset by market cap’s bull cycle has yet to finish.










“I still don’t think that it would be ‘over’ though and that’s it for this cycle. I think that we still are going to see BTC to six figures and some sort of mania.” 
According to the pseudonymous analyst, the crypto king could “giga send” to a price of $100,000 in the fourth quarter of 2024.
However, Altcoin Sherpa says that there are a few compelling bear cases for BTC that could see it fall by up to 35% from its current price before it shoots up to six figures.
“Is it ‘over’? I don’t think so. But I think that this type of price action leads to larger downtrends/pullbacks. Even if BTC goes to $40,000-$50,000, it’s still high time frame bullish. 
But if we saw a move to $50,000, this would result in (probably) a violent move that would wreck the market (move from $60,000-$50,000 would be strong) and altcoins take a 50% haircut or more from current levels…
 We’re not there yet but might need a further washout. I could envision a scenario where BTC goes to $40,000-$50,000, everything gets wiped out, we chop for three to four months around there and then giga send to $100,000 in Q4 2024.”

SBI VC Set To Become a Validator On The XRP Ledger From May 10


							

SBI VC announces plans to become a validator on the XRP Ledger.



The crypto exchange plans to achieve XRP validator status by operating XRP nodes.



According to SBI VC, a validator status will allow it to contribute directly to XRP development.




SBI VC, a foremost cryptocurrency exchange operator in Japan, has announced that it will begin operating nodes as a validator on the XRP ledger from May 10, 2024. According to the exchange, they aim to run a stable operation and achieve recognition by the XRP Ledger community. 



Furthermore, SBI VC highlighted earning a validator status will enable its inclusion in the list of trusted validators (UNL, Unique Node List) recommended by the XRP Ledger Foundation in the future. The exchange also noted that registering with the UNL will enable it to contribute more directly to the development of the ecosystem, including voting on new features of the XRP Ledger. 



It is essential to note that blockchain operators registered with the UNL qualify to contribute directly to the XRP ecosystem development. Hence, SBI VC explained that part of their goal is to be the validator that reflects the voices of the XRP community in Japan.



According to SBI VC, its crypto exchange hosts many XRP holders. Therefore, its validator status achievement and registration with the UNL will enable the effective representation of its customers. The crypto exchange explained that the representation process will involve voting on the XRP development after considering customers’ opinions through surveys.









In addition to customer representation, SBI VC plans to disseminate information and provide education regarding amendments such as new features. The Japanese crypto exchange highlighted that its proposed awareness program will help XRP holders make appropriate and constructive decisions for the ecosystem. 



XRP Ledger is a decentralized blockchain solution that started running in 2012. As a blockchain solution, some of XRP Ledger’s goals include achieving fast settlement, low cost, scalability, and carbon neutrality. Many blockchain users consider XRP Ledger the best L1 public chain for business use cases.

Mastercard Collaborates with US Banking Titans | Coin Insider


Key Takeaways:Enhanced security and efficiency: Tokenisation, which involves replacing sensitive data with unique identification symbols, improves security by reducing the risk of fraud. Mastercard and the partnering banks aim to create a more secure and efficient payment ecosystem by leveraging this technology for settlement trials.Digital transformation acceleration: The collaboration underscores a collective effort towards embracing digital transformation within the financial sector. Potential for industry-wide adoption: Successful trials could pave the way for broader adoption of tokenised settlements. In a move to enhance the efficiency and security of financial transactions, Mastercard has teamed up with prominent United States banking giants to pioneer trials in tokenised settlement.This collaboration marks a significant step forward in digital payments, promising streamlined processes and fortified security measures. Mastercard’s move was to test the use of distributed ledger technology for banking settlements using tokenisation. This partnership between the banking giants and the payment processor suggested that it aims to test a shared-led technology called Regulated Settlement Network (RSN), which enables tokenised assets such as Treasury, investment-grade debt instruments, and money from commercial banks to be settled collectively.Exploring Tokenised SettlementThe tokenised settlement represents a paradigm shift in conducting financial transactions, leveraging blockchain technology to tokenise traditional assets. This process converts assets into digital tokens, each with a unique identifier securely recorded on a blockchain network. This methodology facilitates instant and secure transfers, eliminating the need for intermediaries and reducing transactional complexities. Securities such as investment-grade debt and money from commercial banks are said to function on different systems. RSN suggested that settlement procedures will occur on a single platform by converting various assets into tokens and settling them on a distributed ledger. The trial phase started in late 2022 and expanded to a 12-week pilot phase. Reports suggested that ongoing proof-of-concept (PoC) RSN trials are focused on stimulating settlements in the US dollar.Mastercard’s alliance with leading US banking titans underscores its commitment to spearheading innovation in the payments landscape. By joining forces with industry giants, Mastercard aims to harness the potential of tokenised settlement to revolutionise how transactions are settled, facilitating a more seamless and secure financial ecosystem. This partnership assembles the resources and expertise of key stakeholders to drive forward-thinking solutions that address the progressing needs of consumers and businesses alike. According to a Mastercard statement, the project is focused on increasing the efficiency of cross-border settlements and reducing the chance of error and fraud. Head of Blockchain and Digital Assets at Mastercard, Raj Dhamodharan: “The application of shared ledger technology to dollar settlements could unlock the next generation of market infrastructures — where programmable settlements are 24/7 and frictionless.”Key Objectives and BenefitsThe trials conducted by Mastercard and its banking partners are poised to achieve several key objectives, yielding a myriad of benefits for stakeholders across the financial spectrum. One primary goal is to streamline settlement processes, reducing the time and complexity associated with traditional methods. By leveraging tokenisation and blockchain technology, transactions can be executed faster and more efficiently, enhancing overall operational efficiency. According to the RSN PoC, two significant additions to the participating banking institution have been made. Interbank tokenised deposit networks — USDF Consortium will be a direct participant, and the Tassat Group will be a contributor. The report suggested that Deloitte, another banking giant, will provide advisory services to the Securities Industry and Financial Markets Association (SIFMA) as the program manager. Tokenised settlement offers enhanced security features, mitigating the risks associated with fraudulent activities and unauthorised access. The cryptographic nature of blockchain ensures tamper-proof record-keeping, safeguarding sensitive transactional data against malicious threats. This heightened level of security instils trust and confidence among participants, fostering a more resilient and transparent financial infrastructure. There are a total of 10 participating banking giants, including JPMorgan. Sift, Mastercard, TD Bank NA, US Bank, Citi, Visa, USDF, Zions Bancorp and Wells Fargo. Six more project participants will offer their subject-matter expertise, like the nonprofit MITRE Corporations, Broadridge, BNY Mellon, Tessat Group, ISDA, and the DTCC.Implications for the Future of PaymentsThe collaboration between Mastercard and US banking titans heralds a new era in digital payments, with far-reaching consequences for financial transactions. As tokenised settlement gains traction, traditional payment systems will likely undergo transformative changes, ushering in a more decentralised and inclusive financial ecosystem.The adoption of tokenisation and blockchain technology is poised to extend beyond settlements, permeating various facets of the financial industry. From asset tokenisation to decentralised finance (DeFi) solutions, the possibilities are vast and multifaceted. This shift towards digitisation and decentralisation has the potential to democratise access to financial services, empowering individuals and businesses worldwide.The collaboration between Mastercard and US banking titans for tokenised settlement trials represents a significant milestone in the evolution of digital payments. By harnessing the power of blockchain technology, these trials aim to revolutionise settlement processes, enhancing efficiency, security, and accessibility.

Solana beats Ethereum in key areas: Are investors turning away from ETH? - AMBCrypto



Solana outperformed Ethereum in terms of fees paid out to validators.
Usage on the Ethereum network declined, as the price of ETH fell.

The popularity of the Solana [SOL] network has helped it attract a large number of users, due to which an increase in activity on the network was observed.
Gas is paid
Due to the rising activity on the network, the fees paid out to validators on the Solana network had grown.
Ethereum [ETH] has long been the dominant player in the smart contract platform space. Solana’s rise in popularity, especially if its fees remain competitive with Ethereum’s, could chip away at Ethereum’s market share.
This weakens Ethereum’s position as the go-to blockchain for developers and users.

The state of the Ethereum network has also been dire. Over the last month, the number of daily active addresses on the Ethereum network had declined significantly.
According to Token Terminal, the number of daily active users on the network fell by 2.9% in the last 30 days.
Moreover, the average revenue generated by the network also declined significantly by 81.6% during this period.
Source: Token Terminal
The NFT trades on the Ethereum network also declined significantly over the last month.
The popularity of NFTs from alternative chains such as Bitcoin [BTC] and Solana [SOL] may be grabbing a good chunk of the Ethereum network.

ETH failed to fare well in terms of price as well. Since the 8th of April, its price fell considerably, exhibiting multiple lower lows and lower highs, indicative of a bearish trend.
Coupled with that, the CMF (Chaikin Money Flow) for Ethereum fell significantly to -0.21 during this period. This meant that the money flowing into ETH had declined significantly in the last few days.
The RSI (Relative Strength Index) for Ethereum also declined during this period, implying that momentum was with the bears at the time of writing.

SBF maintains his innocence as he trades rice in jail

FTX co-founder Sam Bankman-Fried still maintains his innocence despite getting 25 years in jail for fraud and while he plans his appeal, he’s taken to commodities trading — namely bags of rice.In his first in-person chat with the media since being locked up in Brooklyn’s Metropolitan Detention Center (MDC) in August 2023, Bankman-Fried spoke to Puck News’ William Cohan in an interview published May 9 which Bankman-Fried’s mother Barbara Fried was involved in organizing.The ex-FTX CEO’s diet sees him get vegan meals that fellow inmates think “literally [smell] like shit” so he lives on beans and rice — the latter has “become one of the currencies of the realm inside MDC.”The alum of trading house Jane Street Capital and co-founder of trading firm Alameda Research reportedly joked about how much better the arbitrage opportunities are in jail compared to his former life as a high-frequency trader.Bankman-Fried was “considerably thinner,” losing 25 pounds (11 kilograms) and was “less pudgy, less manic, less fidgety," with no bags under his eyes, Puck reported.He looked Cohan in the eyes “pretty much the whole time," during the interview — something he “rarely did” before — but the jailed founder admitted he’d “become good at faking” that he was doing well.Source: Tiffany FongBankman-Fried is cordoned off with 35 other male inmates — half reportedly murderers who are cooperating with the government — in a large open dorm-style room in a part of the MDC mostly for female inmates. He’s reportedly extremely bored with only four TVs and a non-internet-connected tablet for entertainment which he plays games on.He’s not worried about his safety but doesn’t sleep well as other inmates wake him to ask about his bags of rice as they want to use them for bartering.SBF thinks he’s “the fall guy”Last month, Bankman-Fried filed notice that he’s appealing his fraud and money laundering conviction, something his lawyers said he’d do when found guilty in November.He speaks to his new lawyer “nearly every weekday for an hour or so” and his approved prescription medication has him “thinking clearly," said Cohan. The former exchange head told Cohan he was “set up to be the fall guy” for the collapse of FTX — saying his only slip-up was negligence that put FTX in a place “vulnerable to a bank run and the devious actions of its competitors” adding a reasonable punishment would be civil, not criminal penalties.Related: Changpeng Zhao gets 4 months, Sam Bankman-Fried gets 25 years — Why? Cohan noted Bankman-Fried “still doesn’t believe he committed any crimes” and painted himself as an innocent participant who didn’t get a chance to negotiate sufficiently with prosecutors.He was also “not exactly apologetic” about the roughly $8 billion in customer funds he was convicted of helping to misappropriate.Bankman-Fried claims the army of lawyers that he passed FTX off to, pinned him for the collapse of the firm. The former CEO believed if he stayed at FTX’s helm, it would not have collapsed into bankruptcy but would instead be a thriving company worth $80 billion.He added he should’ve tried harder to find someone other than ex-girlfriend Caroline Ellison to lead Alameda after his lawyers convinced him it was a conflict of interest to run the trading firm and FTX simultaneously — or just ignored them and continued to run both.Bankman-Fried has asked to stay at the MDC until he files his appeal which should come in July. He can, however, be moved at any time and will likely be placed in a facility near his parents — on the other side of the country in California.If that happens, it’s reportedly likely to be in a prison bus which can take up to four months as it journeys across the United States, which picks up and drops off inmates as it goes.Magazine: Inner City Press says ‘less flashy’ Mashinsky set for less jail time than SBF: X Hall of Flame

                        Arch Labs has secured a $7 million investment to develop a Bitcoin-native application platform.The seed funding round was led by Multicoin Capital with other participants and contributors including Portal Ventures, OKX Ventures, Big Brain Holdings, CMS Holdings, Tangent, Cypher, and Newman Capital.Bridgeless Bitcoin-Native Network
The company planned to utilize this fund to advance Arch’s development of decentralized finance (DeFi) applications directly on the Bitcoin blockchain, bypassing the need for secondary layers or bridges.The reliance on secondary layers often complicates the user experience and compromise the inherent security benefits of operating directly on the Bitcoin network.“Ordinals marked a foundational shift in Bitcoin’s evolution. It signaled the beginning of a new era where Bitcoin could serve as more than just a payment ledger,” said Arch co-founder and CEO Matt Mudano.“This moment paved the way for Arch,” stated Mudano. “We’re building on Bitcoin’s unmatched security and liquidity to unlock an entirely new application ecosystem on the world’s more secure and liquid blockchain.”The funds were raised primarily for the expansion of the platform’s development team. By bringing on additional skilled developers, Arch Labs aims to accelerate the creation and refinement of decentralized applications.
Arch’s Features and Rollout Plan
Arch is a parallelized, proof-of-stake that features a Rust-based zkVM, known as the ArchVM, and a decentralized verifier network, forming a trustless execution environment within the blockchain.“We’ve evaluated several Bitcoin Layer 2’s and all of them make the same set of trade offs that sacrifice security in exchange for speed,” said Multicoin Capital Investment Principal Vishal Kankani.“Arch is explicitly not a Layer 2 in the sense that takers do not have to bridge assets to some untrusted chain to use it,” said Kankani.In addition to expanding its team, Arch Labs is set on launching a public development network (devnet) followed by a mainnet release scheduled for the latter half of the year.This progression will enable early testers and future users to explore the capabilities of the platform, improving stability and functionality before a full-scale public rollout.

Japanese Financial Giant Starts Running XRP Ledger Validator


SBI VC Trade, the cryptocurrency exchange of Japanese financial giant SBI Holdings, has announced the launch of their validator on the XRP Ledger.With its recent move, SBI aims to reflect the voices of its customers who hold the XRP cryptocurrency, according to the company’s announcement. Vet, operator of the XRP Ledger dUNL, has stressed that this is a “huge step” since a large enterprise is now running infrastructure for the XRP Ledger. Ripple initially partnered with SBI back in 2017. It has also offered year-end benefits for shareholders in the XRP cryptocurrency.In 2023, SBI Remit, a subsidiary of SBI Holdings, expanded its XRP-powered services to several countries, including Vietnam and the Philippines. Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse has repeatedly touted Japan as one of the most cryptocurrency-friendly jurisdictions. In 2020, he even suggested that Ripple’s headquarters could be relocated to Tokyo before the SEC took the company to court. In April, Ripple expanded its presence in Japan by announcing a tie-up with Tokyo-based HashKey DX. The aim of the collaboration is to use the XRP Ledger for developing enterprise solutions for customers in Japan.

Notcoin Listing Triggers Over 11% Spike in Toncoin


OKX and Binance, two leading global crypto exchanges, recently announced the Notcoin (NOT) listing on their respective platforms.
The crypto community expressed their enthusiasm following these announcements.
Will Notcoin Enhance the TON Blockchain Ecosystem?
OKX will use its platform for new crypto projects, Jumpstart, to let Toncoin (TON) holders stake their coins for NOT tokens. They have set a staking limit of 4,000 TON per participant. The staking process will start at 06:00 UTC on May 13, 2024.
Binance Launchpool has also introduced Notcoin as its 54th project. Users can farm NOT by staking BNB and First Digital USD (FDUSD). The farming will start on May 13, 2024, at 00.00 UTC.

Notcoin, a community token within the TON Blockchain, gained initial popularity from a viral tap-to-earn game on Telegram. This game has 35 million participants. It also has engaged users and introduced them to Web3 technologies.
Notcoin is now focusing on building an ecosystem. The current focus includes a gaming platform and Web3 project exploration tools.
However, the official launch date for Notcoin remains unannounced. Yet, its listings on CoinGecko and CoinMarketCap suggest the launch is imminent.
This development has positively impacted Toncoin, the TON Blockchain’s native token. Its price increased by about 11.32% in the last 24 hours, trading at $6.57 at the time of writing.

Besides the much-anticipated launch of Notcoin, TON Blockchain has been making headlines lately, notably due to its partnership spree. Among the significant developments is the substantial investment from Pantera Capital. Although the amount is undisclosed, Pantera Capital claimed that TON is their “largest investment ever.”
In a recent blog post, Pantera Capital’s CEO, Dan Morehead, articulated his views on blockchain’s transformative potential—influenced partly by his interactions with Telegram founder Pavel Durov. Morehead highlighted Durov’s commitment to principles of freedom and openness, which are foundational to the Telegram platform and, by extension, to the TON Blockchain.

“We are honored to partner with people of such strong conviction. Pantera recently made the largest investment in its history in TON,” Morehead stated.


Ryan Barney, a partner at Pantera Capital, also shared his thoughts. He further explained the rationale for their TON investment.

“Telegram is a community integrating blockchain technology. That’s just got to be easier. They’ve begun rolling out a blockchain wallet to their 930 million users,” Barney outlined.

The crypto and Web3 sectors have shown increased interest in gaming-themed tokens. For instance, Binance’s listing of SAGA, a native token of layer-1 (L1) gaming blockchain Saga, attracted significant attention. Saga claimed that over $13 billion worth of BNB and FDUSD got staked within 24 hours of its launch on Binance Launchpool.

Venture capital also continues to shape the Web3 gaming niche. Massive investments from firms like Andreessen Horowitz (a16z) in Web3 gaming projects highlight the industry’s renewed interest.

Russian opposition activist launches zero-knowledge voting app to challenge Putin's inauguration - Crypto Briefing




Russian opposition activist and former Pussy Riot lawyer Mark Feygin has launched a referendum on the zero-knowledge voting app Russia2024, challenging the legitimacy of the recent Russian elections and Vladimir Putin’s inauguration as president.The vote, which went live on May 10th, three days after Putin’s inauguration, is the first protest vote on the app following months of audits and stress tests.Russia2024 was built using Rarimo’s Freedom Tool, an open-source, surveillance-free voting solution that leverages blockchain and zero-knowledge cryptography to ensure citizens can poll, vote, and protest without being tracked. The app was first announced in a broadcast on March 9, 2024.Following the announcement, the Kremlin attempted to obstruct the app by filing against it, temporarily removing it from the Apple store, and sponsoring negative reviews, a strategy exposed by a whistleblower who expressed support for the app.“Dissent in Russia is growing more risky and public opinion harder to track. It is critical that we provide reliable, surveillance-proof avenues for protest and polling. Russia2024 and its underlying technology has enabled that,” Feygin said in a press release shared with Crypto Briefing.The app was developed by Kyiv-based Rarilabs, with key contributions from activist developers working anonymously inside regimes around the world. Rarilabs is a privacy-first social protocol backed by Pantera Capital. In 2022, the company raised $10 million at a $100 million valuation for its Series A funding round.According to the project’s whitepaper, the app uses Russia’s machine-readable passport information submitted by a user.The data is then decrypted and verified locally (on a device). Digital identity, once authenticated, is resolved using a generated keypair, which is then used to interact with the app’s smart contract. The image below illustrates how the app works.Zero-knowledge cryptography severs the link between the pass and passport data, and votes are published directly on Arbitrum, an Ethereum L2, where the data then becomes tamper-proof.“Freedom Tool was built to help give a voice to people living in regimes. Its implementation in Russia is an early example of how blockchain and zero-knowledge cryptography can meet the urgent need around the world for privacy technology,” said Lasha Antadze, co-founder of Rarilabs.Antadze previously worked on the Ukrainian government’s e-identity and digitalization reform, as well as the EU’s Stork 2.0 digital signature standardization.

Japanese company Metaplanet acquires an additional 19.87 BTC Worth 200 Million Yen | Cryptopolitan

The Japanese company Metaplanet made headlines after acquiring close to 20 BTC in what looked like Microstrategy’s approach to accumulating Bitcoin. Metaplanet Inc. has embarked on an aggressive approach to buying and holding Bitcoin. Considering this recent purchase, Metaplanet Inc. has a total of 117.7 Bitcoins, currently valued at approximately $7.3 million. Metaplanet’s Inc. is a large investment and consulting firm in the heart of Tokyo, and its decision to aggressively purchase Bitcoins is a clear indicator of a shift in investment strategy. Understanding the Magnitude of Metaplanet’s BTC investmentDepending on who’s reading this, a $6.5 million investment in Bitcoin could represent a significant investment or not. The company’s decision to invest this much in Bitcoin is better understood by looking at its total market cap. Reportedly, the Japanese company’s Bitcoin holdings now account for approximately 33% of its total market capitalization. This is a significant investment in Metaplanet’s books, indicating how valuable the Japanese company perceives Bitcoin. The Japanese Investment and Consulting company follows in the footsteps of pro-Bitcoin corporations like Microstrategy, which have also continued accumulating Bitcoin as part of their primary asset holdings. Metaplanet’s Grand Plan with BitcoinTokyo’s financial institution has completely embraced the corporate Bitcoin standard. Dylan LeClair, who recently joined the company as the Director of Bitcoin Strategy, shared how the company will strategically leverage public capital markets to acquire additional Bitcoin for shareholders over time. According to Dylan, the financial repression in Japan has left investors with limited investment options to choose from. As a result, the company is looking for alternative options like Bitcoin to insulate its balance sheets from realities such as the structural weakness of the yen. The institution’s grand plan is not only to strengthen its balance sheets but also to capitalize on it. Bitcoin is viewed as a safer alternative to hedge against inflation, triggering corporations to explore its benefits. Larger institutions like Microstagey are leading the way. Metaplanet Inc. is looking to be a pioneer of corporate Bitcoin in Japan. The bold steps by the Japanese company set the stage for financial institutions alike to accept Bitcoin as a digital asset, impacting its balance sheets. As a result, the revolution continues to grow, and more investors get exposed to Bitcoin, leading to mass adoption as intended.

Eclipse Founder Accused of Sexual Misconduct, Steps Down


							

Neel Somani, the founder of Eclipse, has been accused of sexual harassment.



Somani maintained his innocence, adding that he never sexually assaulted anyone.



Somani is stepping down as the public face of Eclipse. 




Neel Somani, the founder of Eclipse, Ethereum’s fastest L2 solution powered by the Solana Virtual Machine, focused on privacy, security, and decentralization, has faced allegations of misconduct, ranging from inappropriate social media conduct to serious accusations of sexual assault. 



Haseeb Qureshi, managing partner at crypto VC firm Dragonfly Capital, stated in an X post that his company passed on investing in Eclipse while conducting due diligence on the L2 solution. During the process, Dragonfly found a history of sexual harassment surrounding Somani. 









Qureshi concluded that the fact that Somani received funding and successfully sold millions in secondary for a pre-launch token despite his history is “embarrassing.”



On the other hand, Somani maintained his innocence, stating that he had never sexually assaulted a woman. He said that he’ll quit his role as the “public face” for Eclipse because it wouldn’t be fair to the team and the L2 solution “to have this situation weighing on their reputations,” adding:




“I’ll be temporarily reducing my role as a public face for Eclipse. The senior leaders at Eclipse are well equipped to take on these responsibilities and this will allow these conversations to unfold and the truth to emerge about these allegations.”




Further, in a statement, Eclipse stated that it “remains committed to maintaining the highest personal and professional standards, including gender equality and fair treatment.” The firm will closely monitor the situation and reveal details about the other senior members who are leading Eclipse.Eclipse co-founder Sam Thapaliya commented that his firm is “committed to upholding the highest standards of integrity and accountability” in all its operations.

Analysis of the crypto Qubic, Kaspa and Render

The crypto world is now extremely vast, and in this article we will analyze in particular the trends of Qubic, Kaspa and Render.

The recent performance of the crypto Qubic, Kaspa, and Render
Qubic is a new layer-1 project based on Proof-of-Work (PoW).
PoW is the consensus algorithm used by Bitcoin. Even Ethereum was initially based on PoW, but in September 2022 it switched to Proof-of-Stake (PoS).
Although initially most cryptocurrencies were based on PoW, now most of them are instead based on PoS, because it allows for greater scalability.
PoW, however, remains more secure, even though the level of security achieved by PoS is still high, and that’s why crypto projects based on PoW also survive. For example, Bitcoin is very unlikely to abandon it.
Qubic for example claims to be able to guarantee feeless transactions, even though it is based on PoW. It also claims to use artificial intelligence (AI).
The cryptocurrency QUBIC landed on the crypto markets at the end of 2023, with an initial price around 2.6 millionths of a dollar, although since the bull run had already started by then, the price rose to 5.4 thousandths already during the first week of presence on exchanges.
However, until early February it dropped, even significantly below the initial price, without benefiting from the December bull run. 
Nevertheless, starting from mid-February it began to benefit from the bullrun, rising up to 12.2 thousandths of a dollar. 
However, it was a speculative mini-bubble that burst starting from March. For example, when the price of Bitcoin reached its all-time high, Qbic had already dropped to 9 millionths of a dollar.
The price then continued to decrease, reaching the current 5.8 millionths. 
These seem to be predominantly speculative movements, and since Qbic only capitalizes half a billion dollars, it is possible that its price will remain volatile for a long time. 
At this moment it is difficult to imagine if the project has significant long-term development potential, and given the volatility at this moment its cryptocurrency should be considered a predominantly speculative asset. 
The trend of Kaspa 
Kaspa is also a crypto project based on PoW. 
However, this is a project that has been existing for almost two years, and so far it has grown almost constantly. 
His cryptocurrency KAS debuted on the crypto markets in May 2022, with an initial price of 0.2 thousandths of a dollar. 
Already in the course of the same 2022 it recorded a real first boom, with the price rising to over 9 thousandths of a dollar, and in 2023 the upward trend continued.
After the initial boom in 2022, it has recorded at least three more.
The second one was at the beginning of 2023, when taking advantage of the rebound in the crypto markets, the price of KAS even reached 37 cents. At that point, in less than a year, it had gained 18,000%. 
In light of this performance, it is possible to affirm that the initial price was widely underestimated, although surely the excellent start of 2023 for the crypto markets as a whole must have helped a lot. 
However, he then recorded two more booms, although with lower percentage gains. 
With the beginning of the bullrun, in October of last year, the price of KAS started to rise again, reaching 140 thousandths of a dollar ($0.14) in November. At that point, the initial +18,000% had added another +280%.
However, the crypto bullrun continued in 2024, and so in February the price of Kaspa rose to almost 180 cents of a dollar. 
Since then it has dropped a bit, even reaching below $0.14 in February. 
This trend suggests that the great bull run of Kaspa may have already run its course, and that it probably only served to bring KAS’s market capitalization to the level it deserved, above three billion dollars. 
This is a level comparable to Stellar’s XLM, and only slightly lower than that of CRO. In other words, although it is only in 38th place overall, Kaspa has now entered the ranks of the top 50 cryptocurrencies in the world. 
Prices and latest Render news
A different speech is instead the one concerning Render.
It is indeed a project born in 2020, before the last major bull run of the crypto markets.  
It does not have its own blockchain, but a token called RNDR on the Ethereum blockchain.
Although the price of this token has gone through the great bull run of 2021, its performance over time has remained extremely interesting.
The thing that stands out is that after reaching $7.8 in 2021, in the course of 2024 it managed to do better, setting a new all-time high in mid-March at $13.6. 
This is a remarkable performance, because while in mid-March Bitcoin set a new all-time high of about +6% compared to 2021, RNDR in 2024 performed even 74% better than 2021. 
Furthermore, having debuted on the crypto markets at 0.06$, the performance in 2021 was already remarkable: +13,000%.
It is also worth noting that during the bear market of 2022, the price only managed to return to $0.4, a figure much higher than the $0.1 it had before the start of the great bull run, and that before the start of the late 2023 bull run it had already returned to almost $2.5. 
So although it is a token with a decidedly volatile value, it seems to have an excellent long-term trend, at least up to now. 
It is no coincidence that it has a market capitalization of almost 4.4 billion dollars, which puts it ahead of Ethereum Classic and just slightly below UNI from Uniswap. 
It is difficult to say if this upward trend can last much longer, but for now its trend is definitely positive,

Prices and news of the crypto Solana, Dogecoin and Jupiter

Our column dedicated to the analysis of the crypto world is back: today we analyze three important assets, Solana (SOL), Dogecoin (DOGE) and Jupiter (JUP).

Prices and market statistics of the crypto Solana (SOL), Dogecoin (DOGE), Jupiter (JUP)
The current price of Solana (SOL) is 153.54 USD, marking an increase in the last hour of 0.76%, 5.87% in the last day, and 10.26% in the last week.
This performance shows a strong interest from investors towards Solana, placing it in fifth place in terms of popularity in the cryptocurrency market.
Its market capitalization is 68.9 billion USD, with a trading volume in the last 24 hours of 2.3 billion USD. The amount of SOL in circulation is 448.3 million units.
 Solana holders maintain their positions on average for 145 days, indicating a medium to long-term confidence in the project and its future prospects. The all-time high recorded for SOL was 260.00 USD, demonstrating that the currency has growth potential and can attract further investments. 
The current price of Dogecoin (DOGE) is 0.15 USD, showing an increase of 0.36% in the last hour, 2.63% in the last day, and 13.16% in the last week. 
This positive trend reflects a growing interest from investors in this cryptocurrency, ranked ninth in terms of popularity in the market. Dogecoin has a market capitalization of 21.8 billion USD and a trading volume in the last 24 hours of 1.1 billion USD.
 The circulating supply is 144.2 billion DOGE. Dogecoin holders maintain their positions on average for 85 days, indicating a moderate confidence in the currency. 
The all-time high for DOGE was 0.74 USD, suggesting that, despite its volatile nature, Dogecoin has the potential to reach higher valuations. 
The current price of Jupiter (JUP) is 1.11 USD, with a market capitalization of 1.5 billion USD. These data indicate a stable presence in the cryptocurrency market. 
The trading volume in the last 24 hours stands at 134.8 million USD, demonstrating active participation from investors. With a circulating supply of 1.4 billion JUP, this cryptocurrency shows a wide distribution among holders.
Jupiter has reached a historical high of 1.84 USD, suggesting that the value of JUP has the potential to grow beyond the current price, based on its historical performance. This historical peak provides an important reference point for investors interested in Jupiter’s future prospects in the competitive context of the cryptocurrency market.
NFT Solana: Explosive Growth in the Number of Traders, But Sales are Declining. What’s Happening?
Despite a surprising 111% increase in the number of traders in the NFT market on Solana, total sales are showing an opposite trend.
Recently, data has revealed that the volume of NFT sales on this blockchain has experienced a significant decline. This scenario raises questions about the dynamics behind the increasing interest of investors compared to the decrease in actual transactions.
The enthusiasm for NFTs on Solana is clearly visible from the increasing number of traders, attracted by the low transaction fees and fast processing that the network offers. 
However, the decrease in sales volume could be attributed to several factors. Among these, market saturation and changing investment trends play crucial roles.
Industry experts suggest that, as more individuals are exploring the NFT market as a potential source of income and collecting, caution has become predominant among buyers due to price fluctuations and general economic uncertainty. 
Furthermore, the exponential growth in the number of available NFTs may have made it more difficult for buyers to find unique works that offer long-term value, resulting in a lower frequency of high-profile sales.
This divergence between the entry of new traders and the decrease in sales highlights the complexity and volatility of the NFT market, and suggests that the future of this sector may depend not only on technological innovation, but also on a better understanding of market dynamics and investment strategies by participants.
Dogecoin (DOGE) Price on the Edge: the Threat of the Death Cross
Dogecoin, the popular meme coin, is in a critical phase, with the imminent threat of a death cross that could trigger a significant price correction. 
The death cross, a technical term used in trading to indicate the bearish crossover between the 50-day moving average and the 200-day moving average, is seen as a strong negative signal by market analysts.
In addition, the Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD), an indicator that helps identify changes in momentum and price direction, is showing signs of an imminent bearish crossover. This signal could further strengthen the already observed bearish trends, increasing pressure on traders.
The critical price area for Dogecoin is currently between $0.15 and $0.14, where approximately 12.46 billion DOGE are held. A drop below this level could trigger cumulative losses of around $1.8 billion, accentuating the climate of uncertainty and potential selling panic among investors.
This scenario highlights the intrinsic volatility of Dogecoin and other cryptocurrencies, emphasizing the importance for investors to carefully monitor market indicators and be prepared to adjust their strategies in response to rapid changes in the financial landscape.

Binance Fined by Canada’s FINTRAC Over Policy Breaches


							

Canada’s FINTRAC levied a $4.4 million penalty on Binance.



Binance failed to comply with AML laws, claims FINTRAC.



The regulator also found significant gaps in Binance’s compliance procedures.




Canada’s financial crime watchdog, the Financial Transactions and Reports Analysis Centre (FINTRAC), has fined Binance, the world’s largest cryptocurrency exchange by trading volume, a hefty penalty of 6 million Canadian dollars, equivalent to about $4.4 million USD. 



As per a report from Bloomberg, this fine comes as a consequence of Binance’s failure to comply with laws related to money laundering and terrorist financing.



Fintrac identified several administrative violations, including Binance’s failure to register as a foreign money-services business and its alleged failure to report large virtual currency transactions of C$10,000 or more, along with the required information. These violations point to significant gaps in Binance’s compliance procedures.



This latest penalty adds to Binance’s growing list of regulatory and legal issues. The exchange has been under scrutiny by various regulatory bodies, including the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). 









Last year, Binance faced accusations of prioritizing profits over user protection. In November, Binance pleaded guilty to violating U.S. anti-money-laundering regulations, resulting in a $4.3 billion fine. Additionally, the SEC has filed a civil lawsuit against Binance.



It is important to note that administrative penalties like the one imposed on Binance are aimed at encouraging businesses to change their behavior rather than being purely punitive. These penalties are intended to drive improvements in compliance practices across the industry. 



Under Canada’s Proceeds of Crime and Terrorist Financing Act, regulatory bodies like FINTRAC have the authority to issue such penalties in order to promote a more compliant and secure financial environment.

Shiba Doge Hybrid (SHIDOGE) to Surge 8,000% as MEXC Listing Announced, While Shiba Inu and Dogecoin Struggle



                    

Shiba Doge Hybrid (SHIDOGE) could turn early investors into multi-millionaires if it becomes a mainstream coin, like Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE).



Shiba Doge Hybrid (SHIDOGE), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is poised to explode over 8,000% in price in the coming days.




This is because SHIDOGE has announced its first centralized exchange listing, which will be on MEXC.



This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up.



Currently, Shiba Doge Hybrid (SHIDOGE) can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jupiter and Raydium, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days.




Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Shiba Doge Hybrid (SHIDOGE) could become the next viral memecoin.



To buy Shiba Doge Hybrid on Raydium or Jupiter ahead of the MEXC listing, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for SHIDOGE by entering its contract address – 797CmcxqkLZaSjMd7MdyNZ9swuSzaGdYWkJ65jehiXWa – in the receiving field.



In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price.



If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner.




The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum.



This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like SHIDOGE.

BlockFi partners with Coinbase for fund distribution, shuts down web platform

Bankrupt crypto lender BlockFi is completing its wind-down of operations, revealing its intention to shut down its web platform in May. BlockFi has partnered with Coinbase to allow clients to access and withdraw funds.In a blog post, the company stated that its collaboration with Coinbase will enable “eligible BlockFi Interest Accounts (BIA), Retail Loans, and Private Clients” to withdraw their funds.In November 2022, BlockFi declared bankruptcy following FTX’s collapse, and in 2023, BlockFi announced its closure and outlined plans to return customers’ crypto holdings, with a withdrawal request deadline set for April 28, 2024.The lender informed clients on Thursday, May 9, that as the deadline to withdraw digital assets from the current estate distribution has passed, they will receive instructions on setting up a Coinbase account to facilitate withdrawals, whether using an existing or new Coinbase account.Source: BlockFiThe company is providing an additional opportunity for verification via the BlockFi platform for those who missed the withdrawal deadline and the May 10 deadline. Clients who do not establish an approved Coinbase account may have their assets liquidated into cash and distributed accordingly.The plan administrator will continue to use Coinbase for upcoming distribution rounds, potentially involving recovered funds from FTX.BlockFi stated that it does not intend to partner with any other platforms for cryptocurrency distributions. Therefore, investors are advised to stay cautious to avoid potential scams from third-party entities.Related: FTX victims describe ‘irreparable harm’ ahead of Sam Bankman-Fried’s sentencingBlockFi has faced fraudulent activity in the past, with individuals receiving deceptive emails that mimicked legitimate communications, falsely claiming immediate withdrawals of their remaining balances.BlockFi reached an $875 million in-principle settlement with the estates of FTX and Alameda Research in March. The settlement resolved BlockFi’s claims against FTX, totaling approximately $1 billion, and also saw FTX waive “millions of dollars of avoidance claims and other counterclaims” against BlockFi.BlockFi’s CEO Zac Prince, who testified as a government witness in Sam Bankman-Fried’s criminal trial, said that the actions of the FTX founder directly led to BlockFi’s bankruptcy.In September 2023, the bankruptcy court approved BlockFi’s Chapter 11 plan to repay its 10,000 creditors. Estimates show BlockFi owes up to $10 billion to over 100,000 creditors, including $1 billion to its three largest creditors and $220 million to bankrupt crypto hedge fund Three Arrows Capital.Magazine: What do crypto exchanges really do with your money?

Luxor Q1 report predicts recovery in Bitcoin hashprice over next five months | CryptoSlate

Quick TakeThe Bitcoin mining sector has faced challenges with historically low hashprices in recent weeks following the halving event. However, hash prices surged to multi-year highs on the day of the halving, buoyed by increased fees attributed to Runes.According to Glassnode data, the hash price is $51,915 in USD terms and 0.84 BTC, nearing all-time lows. However, May 9 saw a recent uptick in hash price due to the biggest difficulty adjustment drop since November 2022.Miner Hashprice (Revenue Per Exahash): (Source: Glassnode)Glassnode defines the miner revenue per exahash metric as a tool for gauging daily miner earnings in relation to their proportional contribution to network hash power. It’s derived by dividing the total miner income (combining subsidies and fees) by the current hashrate (in EH/s). This data is provided on a daily basis, offering insights into the daily revenue earned per 1 EH/s of hash power contributed by miners to the network.Luxor, a mining pool and hashrate marketplace, released its Q1 2024 report on the state of Bitcoin mining. The report suggests that the hash price may have reached its bottom, at least in the short term, and anticipates a rise over the next five months. This projection is based on the expectation of either higher transaction fees or a decrease in mining difficulty.The report says:“This means that Luxor Hashrate Forward traders expect hashprice to increase over the next five months by way of either an increase in transaction fees or a decrease in Bitcoin mining difficulty”.Luxor Hashrate Forward Curve (06-May-24): (Source: Luxor)In addition, Luxor’s hashrate forwards are trading above the current spot price through October, also known as Contango.“Luxor’s Hashrate Forwards are trading in contango through October, which means that the contract prices for these forward contracts (which are essentially future contracts, although they trade OTC and not on an exchange) are trading above the current spot price”.The report suggests that hashrate traders are bullish on transaction fees in the short term.“Hashrate traders have been bullish on transaction fees, which they are baking into their expectations for hashprice in the coming months”.I see two potential scenarios for increased fees: First, if the Bitcoin bull run continues, we could see increased adoption and network congestion. Alternatively, another surge in Inscriptions and Runes could also drive up fees.

Memecoins & SocialFi Apps Drive Base Network’s Growth


							

The Ethereum Layer 2 network, Base, has seen a vast growth in adoption and activity.



Franklin Templeton hints at the emergence of a Base Season, reflecting on the platform’s growth.



The rise of SocialFi applications and the growth of Base memecoins have significantly contributed to the popularity of Base.




Base, a relatively new Ethereum Layer 2 network launched by Coinbase, has seen increasing adoption driven by the rise of SocialFi (Social Finance) applications and the growth of Base memecoins. Asset manager Franklin Templeton, in a recent X post, acknowledged the growing demand for Base as the emergence of a “Base Season.”







According to a recent report released by IntoTheBlock, the L2 networks of Ethereum stand out with unique user engagement and transaction management. Among the Ethereum L2s, Base has gained traction, boasting 1.48 million transactions per day.



The blockchain’s ability to maintain large-scale operations is one of the major reasons for the users’ preference for Base over other L2 networks. In addition, the supply of USDC on Base has also increased, currently exceeding $2.5 billion.









Franklin Templeton’s report spotted the surge of SocialFi applications like Friend.Tech is the key driver of the Base’s demand. While most of the crypto-related SocialFi apps are built on Base, more than 46% of transactions on Base are connected to these applications. The report stated, “[It is] positioning itself well to capture a material share of SocialFi activity and remain a leader in the Ethereum L2 sector going forward.’



Sharing insights on Base’s widening adoption and Franklin Templeton’s report, Chinese reporter Colin Wu posted a message on the X platform. Wu wrote, “Driven by memecoins and Friend tech, Base activity has increased significantly.”







Friend.Tech is one of the most popular SocialFi apps built on Base. Users can monetize their content through “key shares” or “tokenized attention.” The report asserted that the contribution of Friend.Tech in the growth of Base activity is much significant. The platform added that Coinbase has had a supporting hand in the growth as it helped the L2 network to capture about half of the SocialFi market share.

Marathon Digital's Mixed Q1: Growth Amid Setbacks


Marathon Digital Holdings, Inc., a US-based Bitcoin mining company, showcased a mixed financial performance in the first quarter 2024.
This period brought significant growth in hash rate and revenues. Yet, it also presented several operational challenges.
Marathon Digital Faced Financial and Operational Challenges Amidst Growth
Marathon’s Q1 2024 revenues soared by 223% compared with Q1 2023 to $165.2 million. Its net income rose 184% to $337.2 million from the same quarter in 2023.
Additionally, the company produced 2,811 BTC, a 28% increase from Q1 2023. However, compared to the Q4 2023, this figure marks a decrease of roughly 34%.

Read more: How Much Electricity Does Bitcoin Mining Use?
Fred Thiel, Marathon Digital’s CEO, explained the reason behind it. He cites unexpected equipment failures and maintenance issues adversely impacting the company’s Bitcoin production.

“Bitcoin production, and therefore revenues, generated during the quarter was negatively impacted by unexpected equipment failures, transmission line maintenance, and higher than anticipated weather-related curtailments at Garden City and other sites during the quarter,” Thiel stated.

Indeed, Marathon’s Bitcoin production trails behind Core Scientific, another US-based Bitcoin mining company. Core Scientific reported 2,825 Bitcoin (BTC) mined during Q1 2024.
Nonetheless, the start of 2024 has been a period of notable expansion for Marathon Digital. The company reported a 142% increase in its energized hash rate, reaching 27.8 exahash per second (EH/s). The figure is up from 11.5 EH/s in the same period last year.

Marathon also expanded its technological infrastructure and product offerings. This quarter saw the introduction of Anduro, a new multi-chain Bitcoin layer-two network. Anduro aims to foster Bitcoin’s development and adoption.
Moreover, Marathon launched several innovative products to enhance the efficiency and performance of Bitcoin mining operations. Among these were Slipstream, a service for speeding up Bitcoin transaction confirmations, and MARA UBC 2100, a control board developed internally to optimize mining operations.
Furthermore, the company has aggressively pursued expansion through acquisitions. It added more than 1.1 gigawatts to its mining capacity.

Notably, 54% of this capacity is now under Marathon’s direct control and operation. This strategic expansion is aligned with Marathon’s ambitious target. It aims to boost its hash rate to 50 EH/s by the end of 2024, doubling its current capacity.
However, Marathon’s overall performance in the quarter didn’t meet analysts at Zacks Equity Research’s estimation. Marathon’s reported revenues missed the Zacks consensus estimate by 14.80%. This led Zacks to adjust the current rank of Marathon Digital’s stock (MARA) status to “hold.”

Marathon Digital’s stock (MARA) price dropped after the earnings report. During after-hours trading, MARA’s price dipped to $18.60 on May 9. In a longer time frame, MARA’s price has been down 14.30% year-to-date.

Ethereum: for the SEC the crypto is a threat to banks

Joseph Lubin, co-founder of Ethereum and founder of Consensys, has released statements regarding the behavior of the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) of the USA against cryptocurrencies. 
According to Lubin, the SEC sees Ethereum as a threat to the banking landscape, and is acting to hinder innovation in the United States. 

Ethereum vs. SEC: according to Lubin, the crypto threatens banks and finance in the USA
At FT Live at the Crypto and Digital Asset summit in London, Joseph Lubin, co-founder of Ethereum and founder of Consensys, spoke about how the SEC is acting against cryptocurrencies.
Specifically, Lubin believes that the Securities and Exchange Commission of the United States is engaging in strategic enforcement actions, rather than having a meaningful dialogue with the cryptocurrency industry.
The lack of regulatory clarity and these actions against crypto, suggest that the SEC is intentionally hindering innovation, which threatens the current banking and financial landscape of the country.
And indeed, according to the co-founder of Ethereum, the actions of the SEC are intended to create fear, uncertainty, and doubt for the cryptocurrency industry “in an attempt to paralyze” and force the company to go offshore.
Regarding this, Lubin said:
“The SEC seems to have reclassified Ether as a security without telling anyone that it is doing so. It is proceeding with a strategic series of executive actions rather than an open discussion and a clear definition of the rules”
Ethereum vs. the SEC: the crypto ETF issue could further scare banks
Lubin then spoke about two other issues concerning the SEC against Ethereum. One is the decision by Consensys to sue the SEC, after receiving a Wells notice from the agency. 
Just with the goal of obtaining greater clarity, the company’s counteraction against the SEC will go to a US court. However, it is worth considering that the Commodity Futures Trading Commission had previously classified Ether ETH as a commodity.
On this subject, here is the tweet from Consensys that explains its position:

“It’s not just about protecting a digital asset, but safeguarding the future of innovation in the United States. It’s about safeguarding the future of innovation in the United States. An overly zealous financial regulator should not hold a revolutionary technology hostage.” – @ethereumjoseph in today’s edition of @FT”
The other issue regarding the SEC vs. Ethereum case, instead, concerns the upcoming deadline for Ethereum spot ETFs, which must be approved or rejected by the end of this month of May 2024. 
Here too, Lubin emphasizes that the SEC’s decision could depend on both the success of capital inflows for the Bitcoin spot ETF and the lack of readiness on the part of banks and the traditional financial system. 
In this sense, Lubin has also hypothesized that the perspective that customers in the banking sector will move assets into digital forms, using decentralized finance constructs, could scare many banks and other financial institutions.
Vitalik Buterin’s new revolutionary proposal: EIP-7702
And while on one hand there is concern about whether government and institutions are ready for the great Ethereum, on the other hand, the other co-founder of Ethereum, Vitalik Buterin, is dealing with his continuous technological progress. 
Recently, Buterin together with Sam Wilson, Ansgar Dietrichs and Matt Garnett, presented a new revolutionary proposal: EIP-7702.
Basically, the proposal aims to refine the concept of “account abstraction” on Ethereum. 
It proposes to introduce a new feature and capability to externally owned accounts (EOA), like normal wallets, allowing them to temporarily assume the functions of a smart contract during a transaction.

Solana Surpasses Ethereum in DEX Volume


Solana has managed to top Ethereum in 24-hour daily volume in decentralized exchanges, according to recent data. The two popular blockchains recorded $1.3 billion and $1.29 billion, respectively, in DEX trading volume. BSC comes in third place with $604 million worth of DEX trading volume. Arbitrum and Base are in fourth and fifth places after generating $510 million and $286 million in DEX trading volume, respectively. Another flippening? It is also worth noting that Solana’s total fees are now at 50% of Ethereum’s fees over the past few days. For comparison, the ratio was just 1% during the 2021 bull run. Some analysts expect Solana to flip Ethereum in fees this month, which would be a major development for the cryptocurrency ecosystem. However, it is worth noting that the capital moving to layer-2 solutions is one of the reasons for this changing dynamics. Solana surges 6% The price of the SOL cryptocurrency has surged more than 6% over the past 24 hours, which makes it one of the best-performing altcoins. The token is currently changing hands at $154 on major spot exchanges. Its market cap currently stands at $68 billion. For comparison, ETH is currently up a modest 1.23%. Yet, with its valuation of $365 billion, it still dwarfs Solana.

                        Rich Dad Poor Dad author and renowned investor Robert Kiyosaki believes that the US dollar is losing value and expressed his support over crypto investments.During a recent episode of the podcast “The Rich Dad Channel,” Kiyosaki discussed the importance of portfolio diversification including cryptocurrencies. Speaking to Andy Shechtman, CEO of Miles Franklin Precious Metals, Kiyosaki advocated investors to turn to gold, Bitcoin and Ethereum.He stressed that the dollar decline is imminent, which is why accumulating alternative investments is vital to be prepared for adverse financial conditions. “Our money is fake,” he noted.“It’s a reason to buy gold, silver, Bitcoin, and all this because our currency is screwed up now, it’s going to get worse because our debt keeps going up.”Kiyosaki revealed that he bought Ethereum “for the same reason.”Further, he criticized the lack of financial literacy education in schools, particularly when there is an already dire financial situation. Kiyosaki also pointed out the absence of counterparty risk issues when it comes to borrowing money.“If I borrow money, who’s the guy to pay me back? And gold and silver – you don’t need that – the same as Bitcoin, you have no counterparty risk.”
Kiyosaki’s Highly Bullish Bitcoin Stance
The bestselling author in March, described the world’s largest crypto – Bitcoin – as “the perfect asset at the right time.” However, he is also having a cautious approach to the asse-class, doubting its potential to be scam or Ponzi scheme.Kiyosaki has maintained a bullish stance on Bitcoin over the years. In November 2023, the financial educator said that Bitcoin is the “best protection” against hyperinflation because it is people’s money. He drew a historical comparison and urged his followers to consider Bitcoin as a means of protection against hyperinflation.However, he wasn’t keen on the spot Bitcoin ETFs, claiming that these financial products are apt for institutional investors. He rather favors direct ownership of physical assets due to his entrepreneurship pathway.Kiyosaki has invested in a mix of assets like gold, silver, Bitcoin, which according to him are bargains today.

Ethereum Spot ETF Dream Dashed? Expert Pessimistic On Approval Prospects | Bitcoinist.com


								Within the cryptocurrency investment space, there has been much debate and conjecture around the possibility of an Ethereum Spot Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs). However, in light of ongoing regulatory obstacles, senior Bloomberg Intelligence analyst Eric Balchunas has offered a gloomy view of the products, noting that the firm is now more pessimistic than ever about the likelihood of the funds being approved by the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).
Ethereum Spot ETF Pessimism Prevails
Eric Balchunas’ insights came in response to the Chief Executive Officer (CEO) of Fizen Leo Vu’s post regarding Grayscale’s CEO Michael Sonneshein’s optimism toward approval of Ethereum spot ETFs. According to Michael, he is very confident that the SEC will grant the company’s request to convert its Ethereum trust into a spot ETF.

Responding to the post, Balchunas expressed his displeasure with the CEO’s claims, highlighting his disagreement and Bloomberg’s constant pessimism toward the products. While Balchunas believes that the funds might be authorized in the foreseeable future, he thinks it will not happen within a year. However, the election in November and what Grayscale says about denial are significant factors that could trigger a shift in the forecast.
Balchunas further noted that Sonneshein mentioned that Grayscale decided to withdraw its ETH futures ETF filed under the Securities Act of 1933 because it wanted to concentrate more on its Spot ETF. Meanwhile, the major purpose of filing the ETH futures under the 1933 Act, as opposed to the 1940 Act, was to create a legal opening.
The expert thinks a potential reason why Grayscale made the move might be because they do not want to pay the whole cost once more to give Blackrock a massive ETF progress, as seen following the approval of the Bitcoin Spot ETFs while taking a lot of crap from people due to unlock outflows.
Shared View On Grayscale’s ETF Withdrawal
Balchunas’ insights have caused quite a stir in the crypto community. Scott Johnsson, a finance lawyer and author, has expressed his agreement with Bloomberg’s analyst overview.

Johnsson may be in line with Balchunas’s perspective on why Grayscale withdrew its Ethereum futures; however, he believes by taking such action, the firm displayed its true intentions. “Can I blame them? I don’t know, but don’t piss on my leg and tell me it’s raining,” he added.
He further stated that without pulling ETHE itself, Grayscale could not claim to be trying to convert ETHE while simultaneously engaging in the single most significant action to obstruct that objective.
Thus, Balchunas concurred with Johnsson saying that the part where he mentioned Grayscale taking a bunch of crap from people was due to high cost, which the company is to blame. “I’m not letting them off the hook for what they said re conversion but rather trying to get others to see it from their perspective/self-interest. When you do everything starts to make sense,” he added.
It is worth noting that the approval odds for Ethereum spot ETFs today now stand at merely 9%, indicating a nearly 90% drop since the first filings were made.

UAE's Crypto Scene Friendlier Than US Due to Political Stability


                        
                            UAE Offers Friendlier Crypto Scene Than US Due to Political Stability: Komodo CTO

                        Komodo CTO Kadan Stadlemann said the United Arab Emirates’ (UAE) political stability fosters a friendlier environment for crypto businesses to flourish, compared to the challenges they face in the US.In a jab at democracies, he said the UAE’s biggest advantage is its monarchy. The exec believes the UAE’s stable leadership, free from the back-and-forth policy changes of democracies, creates a more friendly environment for crypto businesses to grow.In an interview with CryptoNews, he credited the country’s “very stable political basis” as key to its startup friendliness. He also pointed to the UAE royal family’s “genius approach,” which he believes has laid the groundwork for the country’s booming economic growth.Stadlemann was attesting to the UAE making efforts to welcome crypto companies. All virtual asset service providers need to get licensed from the Virtual Asset Regulatory before they can operate there.The CTO also highlighted that UAE’s low crime rate creates a safe environment that supports business growth. He attributes this to strict laws that target crime effectively.On the other hand, he criticized the US for its overregulated crypto environment.
Crypto Exec Advocates For US Regulatory Reform for Crypto Growth
The Securities and Exchange Commission is typically called out for its “overreach” in handling crypto-related matters. In 2023, the regulator filed 46 enforcement actions within the industry and raked up fines worth $2.8b.“I believe the US (crypto economy) is being let down,” Stadelmann said. He added that he knows of several crypto projects that have chosen to relocate from the US to more welcoming regions like Latin America, Europe, Southeast Asia, and the UAE.“I believe they need industry experts involved, with all due respect. But I believe that’s what you get when you have a bunch of boomers and noobs try to regulate something they really literally don’t understand,” he said.“After years of struggle within the regulatory layer, you just get tired of it. And that’s kind of where we are.”The crypto exec called for a smarter approach to crypto regulation. He emphasized the industry’s wealth of expertise in core blockchain technology and its principles. This knowledge, he says, can be harnessed to develop regulations that protect investors and prevent illegal activity, without stifling innovation. Stadlemann believes regulators need to re-evaluate their current frameworks to find a more balanced approach.
Stadelmann’s Relocation Shows UAE Wins Crypto Talent as Netherlands Loses Grip
For over 7 years, Stadlemann part of the team at Komodo, an open-source, end-to-end blockchain and cryptocurrency platform. JL777, an anonymous leader, spearheaded Komodo’s creation in 2014. This decentralized platform allows developers across industries to conduct anonymous transactions.The exec now plans to relocate from Amsterdam to the UAE, leaving what he sees as growing hostility towards crypto in the Netherlands. This trend is also causing DEX and DeFi projects to depart the Netherlands.Facing regulatory hurdles in the Netherlands, Binance too pulled out of the Dutch market after failing to secure a virtual asset service provider license.Stadelmann cited Dubai’s “extremely startup friendly legal framework” as the reason behind his relocation.“I have a huge network of crypto entrepreneurs, and they’re following the same trend,” he said. “They are heading down to Dubai, to Abu Dhabi.”“I believe the UAE is going to take over the financial world and become the financial epicentre in regards to what Frankfurt London Zurich, New York, Chicago are today.”

                        Bitcoin Price PredictionBitcoin (BTC) dipped slightly by 0.20%, settling at $63,000, yet maintains a bullish stance in the latest bitcoin price prediction. The rise in jobless claims to 231,000, the highest since August 2023, suggests a cooling U.S. labour market, prompting anticipatory actions by the Federal Reserve.This could lead to rate reductions earlier than projected, influencing Bitcoin’s appeal as a non-traditional investment.
U.S. Jobs Data Sparks Rate Cut Speculation—What’s Next for BTCThe Labor Department reported a notable increase in initial jobless claims for the week ending May 4, reaching 231,000—22,000 more than the previous week and well above the Dow Jones estimate of 214,000. This marks the highest level since August 26, 2023, signalling possible economic strains and a cooling labour market that had previously shown resilience.Initial Jobless Claims – Source: Tradingeconomics Continuing claims also increased, rising by 17,000 to 1.78 million, while the four-week moving average of claims climbed to 215,000. These figures suggest a gradual economic slowdown, prompting discussions about the Federal Reserve’s potential early rate cuts to stimulate growth. Such a softening in the labour market has historically been a catalyst for Bitcoin price as investors turn to non-traditional assets.
Nonfarm Payroll Adds to ConcernApril’s nonfarm payroll data added to these concerns, showing a gain of only 175,000 jobs, far below the expected 240,000. This was the smallest increase since October 2023. However, the unemployment rate remains stable at 3.9%, under 4% since February 2022, indicating that the job market is not in crisis but may be normalizing.Analysts Christopher Rupkey and Robert Frick have noted the volatility and surprising rise in jobless claims, suggesting potential further fluctuations in the labour market. Officials of the Federal Reserve, whose goal is to maintain a 2% inflation rate, carefully examine these circumstances.
The recent spike in U.S. jobless claims suggests a potential economic slowdown.
April’s modest job gains and stable unemployment hint at market normalization.
The Fed may cut rates sooner, possibly boosting Bitcoin investment as lower rates reduce fixed-income asset yields.
As expectations mount for the Fed to ease monetary policy in response to a weakening job market, possibly starting rate cuts as early as September, Bitcoin could benefit. Lower interest rates make riskier assets like cryptocurrencies more appealing. Bitcoin Price PredictionBitcoin (BTC) observes a minor decline of 0.20%, with the current trading price at $63,000, however, bitcoin price prediction still remains bullish.The pivot point at $61,011 sets the stage for determining directional movements, with immediate resistance observed at $64,851. Should bullish momentum prevail, subsequent resistance levels at $67,084 and $69,356 could be tested.Bitcoin Price Prediction – Source: TradingviewConversely, immediate support forms at $58,852, with further downside protection seen at $56,677 and $54,327. The RSI at 54 indicates a relatively neutral market stance, while the 50-day EMA at $62,375 provides underlying support near the $62,000 mark, suggesting a balanced yet cautious market sentiment.A decisive move below $62,500 could trigger a significant selling trend, highlighting the importance of this threshold in BTC’s near-term price actions.

R. Kiyosaki's stark warning: Stop living in Disneyland and prepare for depression


Not long after stressing that a financial crash was already here and that it would be a ‘bad one,’ the popular investor and author of the best-selling personal finance book ‘Rich Dad Poor Dad,’ Robert Kiyosaki, has warned his followers to get ready for a depression instead of living in ‘Disneyland.’
As it happens, Kiyosaki said he didn’t want a depression to happen but that “it is better to be preparing for the worse rather than live in Disneyland, which most people are doing,” adding that “for years,” he could “see this crisis coming,” as he elaborated in an X post on May 9.
Specifically, as examples of things he was doing to prepare for the crisis he saw coming years ago, the finance educator listed writing his ‘Rich Dad Poor Dad’ book, starting his own business, using debt as money to buy cash-flowing assets such as rental properties, and saving gold, silver, and Bitcoin (BTC).


Additionally, he pointed out the opportunities that such a time can offer for those well-prepared for it, even arguing that “depression can be the perfect time to get rich, really rich,” telling his followers to “stop living in Disneyland and prepare to get rich… very rich.”

Getting rich during crash
As a reminder, when sharing his earlier warning of a particularly ugly crash and his rules to stand by during such a time, Kiyosaki also expressed his view that “crashes are the best time to get rich” because “bargains will float to the surface,” as Finbold reported on May 3.
Back in early April, he also highlighted that “most people have no idea” what the previous confession by United States Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell that inflation was higher than expected meant for them or their families or to the world,” and that, in simple language, it meant “we’re F’d.”
At the same time, the author continues to advise saving gold, silver, and Bitcoin instead of the “fake money” like the US dollar, arguing that the rich save the above assets, while the poor and middle-class work for fiat, which they then invest in stocks, bonds, mutual funds, and exchange-traded funds (ETFs).

Veteran Trader Peter Brandt Warns Of Impending Regulatory Crackdown On Crypto Staking: 'It's Going To Be A Bloodbath' - Benzinga

Veteran trader Peter Brandt has sparked a discussion within the cryptocurrency community with his recent remarks on X.What Happened: On Thursday, Brandt predicted a severe regulatory crackdown on crypto staking, describing the future landscape as a “bloodbath.” “If the crypto community is upset over the @SECGov treatment of $XRP, $ETH et al as securities, Prediction: Wait until the @USOCC @SECGov @USTreasury do a full assault attack over staking It’s going to be a bloodbath,” he wrote.Brandt’s comments reflect concerns over potential aggressive actions from not only the SEC but also the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) and the U.S. Treasury.See Also: Bitcoin, Ethereum, Dogecoin Trade Sideways, Trader Asks: ‘Does It Matter If You Buy Bitcoin At $62,000 OrWhy It Matters: There have been a series of legal challenges and regulatory actions that have heightened tensions within the crypto market. A recent court ruling against Coinbase Global Inc. COIN largely dismissed the company’s motion to fend off SEC allegations of unregistered securities activity, particularly concerning its staking program.Furthermore, the market has seen significant volatility with major cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin BTC/USD and Ethereum ETH/USD experiencing price dips following regulatory scrutiny. Notably, Robinhood Markets Inc. HOOD reported a substantial increase in crypto trading volume despite receiving a Wells notice from the SEC, indicating a complex and defiant landscape.Amid these developments, Ethereum co-founder Joseph Lubin has accused the SEC of hampering the growth of the crypto sector. His company, Consensys, is embroiled in a legal battle with the SEC over Ethereum’s classification. Additionally, the U.S. House of Representatives has taken a stand against the SEC’s crypto custody rules, a move that President Joe Biden has vowed to block, further highlighting the contentious regulatory environment.Read Next: Here’s How Much $1,000 Invested In Dogecoin Would be Worth If You Invested When Elon Musk First Tweeted About DOGEImage via Shutterstock

Ripple Teams up to Build a Secret Management Protocol


Ripple, the issuer of XRP tokens, has formed a strategic alliance with Algorand and Hedera, aiming to revolutionize secret management. 
This partnership inaugurates the DeRec Alliance, which also includes Swirlds Labs and XRPL Labs among its founding members.
What is DeRec Alliance?
The DeRec Alliance is dedicated to enhancing digital asset recovery through an open-source protocol. This system allows for the secure and confidential recovery of digital secrets, such as passwords and keys, using a method based on secret sharing.
Founding members, including Ripple, are pivotal in the Technical Oversight Committee (TOC). They influence governance and policies that shape the future of digital asset security. The TOC provides expert oversight and direction, which is critical in guiding the alliance’s strategic initiatives.
Read more: What is a Private Key in Crypto?

The demand for such a system has surged as digital asset adoption increases. Traditional recovery methods often leave assets at risk or completely irrecoverable if the owners lose their keys. 
For example, Rain Lõhmus of LHV Bank cannot access 250,000 Ethereum worth over $700 million. Also, former Ripple CTO Stefan Thomas is locked out of a Bitcoin (BTC) wallet due to a forgotten password. Thomas’ 7,000 BTC are worth over $441 million.

The DeRec protocol involves a network of ‘helpers’ – either friends or businesses – who each hold a part of a user’s digital secret. If the user loses access to their device or data, these helpers can collaboratively reconstruct the secret. This system ensures that no single helper accesses the complete secret, maintaining high security and redundancy without compromising privacy.
Additionally, the system is designed to automatically adapt to changes, such as when helpers join or leave. This feature maintains the integrity of the secret, ensuring continuous security despite changes in the user’s network of helpers.

“The DeRec Alliance addresses one of the biggest challenges facing mainstream crypto adoption—secure and user-friendly management of private keys. By establishing clear standards for key recovery, this collaboration across the crypto industry empowers individuals to take control of their digital assets with confidence,” Markus Infanger, Senior Vice President of RippleX, said.

Despite progress, Ripple faces ongoing legal challenges from the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). For instance, on May 7, the SEC objected to Ripple’s plan of issuing a “new unregistered crypto asset.”

However, the SEC has not mentioned more details about the new crypto asset.

'Age of Ethereum' Incoming for 5 Key Reasons

Despite some skepticism, Ethereum has five compelling reasons that it has a bright future, presented from a balanced perspective.Superior ecosystem compared to Bitcoin’s L2:While Bitcoin's layer-2 (L2) applications are developing, they currently lag behind Ethereum in terms of functionality and user experience. Ethereum has established itself as the preferred platform for developers, largely due to its more mature ecosystem and broader acceptance. Despite the noise around Bitcoin’s potential for application development, Ethereum remains the go-to for developers looking for robust, tested and versatile solutions.ETH/USD Chart by TradingViewRegulatory challenges may not be pivotal:There is a lot of talk about the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) possibly classifying Ethereum as a security. However, the outcome of this regulatory scrutiny is still uncertain. Even if Ethereum faces some regulatory hurdles, its integral role in the finance and tech sectors — backed by significant support from big tech and traditional finance (tradfi) asset managers — suggests it could withstand potential challenges.Scalability and competition from Solana:Solana has been marked as a more scalable blockchain platform with faster growth in applications. However, its scalability benefits are accompanied by technical risks and less diversity in the client base compared to Ethereum.Adoption by major financial players:Major financial institutions like Visa, MasterCard, JP Morgan and Citibank have explored blockchain solutions separate from Ethereum. Yet, the interoperability and established network of Ethereum could eventually attract these giants. The blockchain’s ability to operate on a trustless, global scale makes it an attractive backbone for future financial operations.Symbiotic relationship with layer-2 solutions:There is a misconception that value primarily accrues to layer-2 technologies rather than Ethereum itself. In reality, Ethereum and its layer-2 solutions enjoy a symbiotic relationship. The success of applications running on Ethereum's network enhances the core platform's value, akin to how railways benefit from the businesses they enable.

Dogecoin (DOGE) Appears Headed for a 'Golden Cross'

During DOGE's early 2021 run, interest rates were near or below zero worldwide, which catalyzed unprecedented risk-taking across all corners of the financial market. That's not the case any more, with rates in the U.S., the world's largest economy, at multiyear highs above 5%.

Livepeer (LPT) Coin is Trending: Announcement Coming Up for Web3 Social Media Platform | Cryptopolitan

Livepeer (LPT) undergoes another boom cycle with a vertical price climb. LPT reached $19.33, within one price move from its yearly peak above $25. Demand for the token led LPT to a monthly peak in trading volumes above $106M in 24 hours. In 2024, LPT achieved two other vertical climbs and moved to a higher tier as interest returned to Web3 projects. The hope for LPT is to return to its all-time peak, when the token traded above $68 during the 2021 bull market. LPT remains at risk for deep corrections. Its most active trading pair on Binance, LPT/USDT, has only $181K liquidity for 2% slippage.LPT Shifts Trading ProfileIn the past month, the LPT trading profile has also shifted as tokens moved to a different set of exchanges. Binance and Coinbase marked net withdrawals for LPT, while the tokens flowed into OKX, Gate.IO, and other small exchanges.The token may undergo rapid inflows and outflows due to limited arbitrage opportunities. There is a disparity in LPT pairings, which may explain the increased trading activity.Livepeer was also selected as one of the projects in Grayscale’s portfolio, and it became the top performer during the latest rally. LPT stands out as a blue chip when decentralized storage and computing tokens are also expanding. The LPT rally follows highly active days for Render (RNDR), Akash Network (AKN) and AIOZ Network (AIOZ).Livepeer Aims for Development Beyond Short-Term Price HypeLivepeer has a long-term goal of building the world’s decentralized video infrastructure. The project aligns with the trending DePIN projects that focus on distributed computation and infrastructure. In May, Livepeer is boosting its social media profile with a pre-announcement. Livepeer will present its network upgrade and new tools to combine AI and video streaming during the ETH Berlin meetup. Livepeer aims to grow its influence, targeting content creators and developers. The project claims to offer 80% lower costs than existing cloud and video streaming services. All video streaming is supported by the globally available Livepeer Network, which combines user resources for lag-free streaming. Livepeer also boosted its brand in 2023, by creating enterprise products for prominent social media companies. So far, Livepeer has onboarded partners like Fishtank LIVE, Minds, Switchboard, The Lot Radio, and MyPrize. Independent creators can also use open-source Livepeer API to stream on demand. Livepeer Stands Behind Video VerificationLivepeer is also focusing on emerging problems with streamed content. With the rise of AI, the veracity of every video may be questioned. Livepeer is researching tools to prevent fake content and AI-generated fakes. Reliable and verified video is key, as Livepeer strives to grow the adoption of its flagship product, Livepeer Studio. Livepeer aims to become a key player in the growth industry of video streaming. In 2023, global streaming reached $553B and is projected to grow to 671.8B by the end of 2024. Video streaming still depends on AWS usage and other centralized cloud services. Blockchain projects are trying to achieve better pricing and access to grab a piece of the expanding market.Recent studies show decentralized streaming may be taking off this year. In April, Livepeer marked 30% growth compared to Q4, 2023. Through a series of updates and development over the years, Livepeer achieved the current network potential. The Livepeer Network itself is scalable, but the LPT asset remains an Ethereum-based token. Livepeer distributed its tokens in 2018 before developing its streaming service to ensure widespread holding of the tokens. Around 30% of all LPT tokens are in an escrow treasury. LPT also has 12% of its supply stored in a Binance wallet, suggesting sellers may be waiting in the sidelines to take profits. But LPT also has long-term holders, and has been distributed to more than 2.2 million wallets over the past six years. LPT tokens also have key utility and are used by streamers to pay for online resources. As streamers grow, so does demand for LPT. Network “orchestrators” receive the tokens as payment from streamers, who require the CPU, GPU, and bandwidth resources for on-demand streaming.

Bitcoin Is Getting Less Difficult To Mine After Halving - But Is That A Good Or Bad Sign? - Benzinga

Bitcoin BTC/USD miners may heave a sigh of relief as the network experienced its largest negative difficulty adjustment since November 2022. What Happened: The Bitcoin blockchain underwent its fourth negative difficulty adjustment for the year, according to CryptoQuant's Head of Research Julio Moreno, making it easier for the halving-battered sector to produce blocks and generate new Bitcoins. The mining difficulty is adjusted every 2.016 blocks, or roughly two weeks, to ensure block production time remains at 10 minutes. It is positively correlated with hash rate, the computational power dedicated by miners.The latest 5.7% drop in difficulty comes as a likely response to the 10% decline in the 7-day moving average of the hash rate from 655 EH/s on the halving day to 586 EH/s as of May 10, according to Hash Rate Index. Why It Matters: The quadrennial halving that slashed block rewards, severely impacted miners' revenue streams. CryptoQuant's Moreno noted, "As revenue has declined sharply after the halving, Miners are currently underpaid by the most since March 2020, the COVID crash." The loss in earnings prompted many participants, particularly those operating on a small scale, to turn off their machines and abandon the market. This caused a hash rate decline and subsequently led to a negative difficulty adjustment.The sentiment was echoed by Luxor mining pool CEO Nick Hansen who reportedly told Decrypt, "If there isn't enough margin for miners to make a profit, they turn off, which causes the hash rate to go down.”That said, CEO of mining firm Optiminer Scott Noris pointed out that this bodes well for the sector’s future growth. "The miners who planned properly will grow or the ones who turned off will get newer tech and find cheaper energy while everyone waits for the price to reflect the halving," he told Decrypt.With difficulty lowered and competition lessened, mining costs could decrease, providing temporary relief for the sector.Miners earn the majority of their revenues through fixed subsidies from every block produced. Halvings attack this very component severely, as each occurrence reduced rewards by 50%. Price Action: At the time of writing, Bitcoin was trading up 2.81% at $62919.46, according to data from Benzinga Pro.Read Next: Joseph Lubin Accuses SEC Of Stifling Crypto Growth Amid Legal ShowdownPhoto by Gaston Cerliani on Shutterstock

Cardano Founder Charles Hoskinson Says Voting For Biden Is A 'Vote Against American Crypto Industry' - Benzinga

Charles Hoskinson, the founder of Cardano ADA/USD, has accused President Joe Biden of actively working to stifle the Bitcoin BTC/USD and cryptocurrency industry in the United States.What Happened: Hoskinson, in a video posted on social media platform X on Thursday, criticized the Biden administration for its alleged efforts to “destroy the American cryptocurrency industry,” reported Cointelegraph.The Cardano founder pointed out that the U.S. government has been detrimental to the crypto industry through various means, including restricted access to bank accounts and the Securities and Exchange Commission’s policy of regulation by enforcement. He also criticized the White House for obstructing the legislative process."A vote for Biden is a vote against the American cryptocurrency industry," Hoskinson said.Hoskinson’s comments were in response to a statement from the White House, indicating that President Biden would veto legislation aimed at overturning SEC guidelines that discourage banks from holding crypto assets."The [Trump] administration had its issues but mostly ignored our industry. The Biden administration has engaged in a coordinated effort to kill crypto," Hoskinson said.See Also: Bitcoin, Ethereum, Dogecoin Dip After Robinhood Gets Wells Notice From SEC — Analyst Says ETHs Weak Fundamentals A ‘Roadblock’ For King CryptoHe also criticized the SEC for using outdated legislation that he believes should not apply to new and emerging asset classes. Hoskinson cited other countries such as Switzerland, Singapore, and Dubai, which have welcomed crypto companies and reaped the benefits of substantial investments.Notably, Hoskinson’s comments were challenged by a Twitter user who pointed out that the Trump administration had also been unsupportive of crypto. Hoskinson, however, stood by his claims, asserting that the Biden administration’s stance was “completely wrong.”Why It Matters: The Biden administration’s approach to cryptocurrency has been a subject of debate and scrutiny. The House of Representatives recently voted in favor of a resolution seeking to overturn a controversial SEC cryptocurrency accounting directive, indicating a growing divide between legislative preferences and executive defense of regulatory measures.Earlier in March, a poll revealed that former President Donald Trump was the top choice for U.S. voters who own cryptocurrencies. This indicates a potential shift in voter sentiment towards the Biden administration’s handling of the crypto industry.On the other hand, Trump has recently publicly endorsed cryptocurrency, positioning it as a significant election issue, which contrasts with President Biden’s perceived unfamiliarity with the crypto world.Read Next: Trump Pledges To ‘Make Sure You Can’ Donate Using Crypto To His 2024 Campaign — Unwittingly Sends Memecoin Parodying Biden SurgingImage Via Shutterstock Engineered by Benzinga Neuro, Edited by Kaustubh BagalkoteThe GPT-4-based Benzinga Neuro content generation system exploits the extensive Benzinga Ecosystem, including native data, APIs, and more to create comprehensive and timely stories for you.

Ethereum ETF Applications: Is There Potential For New Breakthrough? - Coincu



	

Following the groundbreaking approval by the SEC of 11 spot Bitcoin ETFs on January 10, attention now turns to the potential approval of spot Ethereum ETFs in 2024. Notable contenders leading the charge in Ethereum ETF applications include VanEck, BlackRock, and ARK Invest, underscoring the Escalating interest from major financial institutions in cryptocurrency-based investment products. Let’s take a look at the companies participating in this race with Coincu.




				
			


Overview of spot Ethereum ETF



What is a spot Ethereum ETF?



Functioning akin to traditional ETFs, spot Ethereum ETFs are managed by institutions that commit to purchasing and holding Ethereum (ETH) in their reserves.



These ETFs are subsequently listed on conventional stock exchanges, where they issue shares representing ownership of the ETF. Traders can then gain exposure to the real-time price movements of Ethereum through trading these shares, as they reflect the value of the ETH held by the institution.





It’s essential to understand that while owning shares of a spot Ethereum ETF provides exposure to the ETF’s underlying ETH reserves, it does not equate to direct ownership of individual ETH tokens. Shareholders hold claims on the value of the ETH holdings rather than the cryptocurrency itself.



Moreover, institutions managing the ETF may employ various strategies with the underlying ETH, such as lending it out or engaging in staking activities, in a bid to potentially enhance returns for the ETF.

How Does a Spot Ethereum ETF Work?



A spot Ethereum ETF operates as a pool where traders contribute funds to purchase Ethereum directly. Unlike futures-based ETFs, which track Ethereum’s price using derivatives like ETH futures, spot Ethereum ETFs hold the actual Ether coins to mirror the cryptocurrency’s price movements. Here’s how it works:



Spot Ethereum ETF buying structure



When investors buy shares of a spot Ethereum ETF, their funds are pooled together to acquire Ethereum coins. The value of the ETF shares then correlates with the price of Ether. If the price of Ethereum increases, the value of the ETF shares rises proportionally, and conversely, if the price of Ethereum decreases, the value of the ETF shares declines.



Behind the scenes, the ETF manager plays a crucial role in ensuring that the ETF accurately reflects the real-time market value of Ethereum. To maintain alignment with Ethereum’s price fluctuations, the manager may engage in activities such as creating and redeeming units, which involve exchanging large blocks of ETF shares for the underlying Ether or vice versa.





Exposure to ETH price



Despite the manager’s efforts to keep the ETF’s value in line with Ethereum’s price, slight disparities may occur due to factors such as trading costs and the frequency of rebalancing. Nonetheless, the goal of a spot Ethereum ETF is to provide investors with a convenient and transparent means of gaining exposure to Ethereum’s price movements without the complexities associated with directly owning and managing the cryptocurrency.

Benefits of spot Ethereum ETF



Ethereum ETFs offer several compelling benefits for investors looking to participate in the Ethereum market without the intricacies of directly managing digital assets. Here are some key advantages:





Ethereum ETFs enable investors to tap into the Ethereum market without the need to directly own and manage the cryptocurrency through traditional exchanges. By including Ethereum ETFs in their investment strategy, individuals can spread their risk across multiple assets, potentially mitigating losses if one asset underperforms.






Ethereum ETFs are typically available on public exchanges, making it convenient for investors to buy and sell shares during regular trading hours. Unlike purchasing and managing Ethereum directly, which can involve navigating various cryptocurrency exchanges and wallets, investing in an Ethereum ETF streamlines the process, offering a familiar and straightforward investment avenue.





One of the notable advantages of investing in Ethereum ETFs is the assurance of professional management. With an ETF, investors entrust the oversight and security of their digital assets to seasoned experts who manage the fund on their behalf. 



Instead, they can rely on the expertise of ETF managers to navigate the dynamic cryptocurrency market and make informed investment decisions that align with the interests of shareholders.





Storing and securing Ethereum tokens can be a daunting task, requiring knowledge of cybersecurity best practices and constant vigilance against potential threats. 





By investing in Ethereum ETFs, individuals can sidestep the risks associated with hosting wallets and safeguarding private keys. Instead, the responsibility for safeguarding digital assets falls on the ETF custodians and managers, who employ robust security measures to protect investors’ holdings.

List of All Companies That Have Applied for Spot Ethereum ETFs



The SEC is in the midst of its second round of reviews for spot Ethereum ETFs. This process involves examining applications from various issuers, with at least eight major players currently awaiting approval.



Among those seeking approval for Ethereum Spot ETFs are industry giants like Fidelity, BlackRock, Invesco with Galaxy, Grayscale, Hashdex, 21 Shares with ARK, VanEck, and Franklin Templeton. Each of these issuers has submitted applications for ETFs tied to Ethereum, highlighting the growing interest in cryptocurrency-based investment products.



Top Ethereum ETF Applications



VanEck



Among the leading Ethereum ETF applications is VanEck, which made headlines as the first to file for an Ethereum ETF spot in September 2023.



BlackRock



Following closely behind is BlackRock, a major player in the financial industry, which submitted its Ethereum ETF application in November of the same year, signaling its interest in entering the Ethereum ETF market.



ARK Invest



Another significant contender is ARK Invest, known for its innovative approach to investment strategies. ARK Invest filed for its Ethereum ETF last September, joining the ranks of institutions seeking approval to offer investors exposure to the burgeoning cryptocurrency market through ETFs.



Other Ethereum ETF Applications



Fidelity



Fidelity, a renowned name in the investment management industry, filed for its Ethereum ETF in November 2023. With its extensive experience and reputation in the financial sector, Fidelity’s entry into the Ethereum ETF market underscores the broadening appeal of cryptocurrencies among traditional investors. The Fidelity Ethereum Fund would be made available to the public on the Cboe BZX Exchange upon approval.



Invesco Galaxy



Another notable Ethereum ETF application is Invesco Galaxy, which submitted its application for an Ethereum ETF in October 2023. Invesco Galaxy’s involvement in the Ethereum ETF space reflects the continued expansion of offerings within the cryptocurrency investment landscape as established players seek to provide investors with diverse opportunities to access digital assets.



Hashdex



In September, the Nasdaq stock exchange submitted a request to list the Hashdex Nasdaq Ethereum ETF with the SEC. Toroso Investments, a member of the National Futures Association and a certified commodity pool operator with the Commodities Futures Trading Commission, oversees and manages the fund.



Grayscale



Grayscale, a prominent cryptocurrency asset management firm, is also seeking approval for its Ethereum ETF after filing its Ethereum ETF application in October 2023. Grayscale’s entry into the Ethereum ETF market further validates the growing institutional interest in cryptocurrencies and demonstrates confidence in the potential of Ethereum as a leading blockchain platform.



Hashdex, a global asset management firm specializing in cryptocurrency investments, filed for its Ethereum ETF in September 2023.



Franklin Templeton



Franklin Templeton has officially entered the competition for Ethereum ETFs, as confirmed in a filing on February 12. With an approval deadline set for November 2024, the asset manager has outlined its strategy, which notably deviates from conventional approaches seen in the industry.



Unlike some competitors, Franklin Templeton’s proposal emphasizes cash creations and redemptions, eschewing the typical in-kind transactions involving direct crypto transfers.



In its filing, Franklin Templeton disclosed its choice of custodians, highlighting Coinbase Custody for cryptocurrency custody and the Bank of New York Mellon for cash custody, administration, and transfer agency services.



Background of Ethereum ETF Applications



VanEck



VanEck, a seasoned player in the financial industry with a focus on mutual funds and ETFs, has been striving to establish a foothold in the cryptocurrency market for several years. While its attempts to launch a bitcoin ETF in the United States have encountered setbacks, the firm has maintained its pursuit of opportunities in the digital asset space.



In 2021, VanEck Europe, an arm of the company responsible for approximately 50 ETFs traded on stock exchanges throughout Europe, introduced the VanEck Crypto and Blockchain Innovators UCITS ETF. This ETF, designed to tap into the potential of the crypto and blockchain sectors, offers exposure to a diversified portfolio that includes prominent companies such as Coinbase Global, Block, Marathon Digital, Bitfarms, and MicroStrategy, alongside other smaller allocations.





Despite its relative novelty in the market, the VanEck Crypto and Blockchain Innovators UCITS ETF has quickly gained traction among investors. It has emerged as one of the top-performing ETFs within VanEck Europe’s portfolio, ranking among the top 15 by assets under management. The fund’s performance has been marked by considerable volatility, distinguishing it from many other products offered by VanEck Europe.



BlackRock



BlackRock, the globe’s largest asset manager, submitted a proposal for a Bitcoin ETF to the SEC last June. The announcement has injected fresh enthusiasm into the crypto market, leading to a remarkable recovery.



The significance of BlackRock’s venture into the realm of Bitcoin ETFs extends beyond mere market dynamics. It serves as a validation of cryptocurrencies and underscores the broader trend within the global financial ecosystem towards embracing digital assets. The proposal not only reflects growing institutional interest in cryptocurrencies but also suggests a shifting paradigm in how traditional finance views digital currencies as a legitimate asset class.





Earlier this year, the financial behemoth made headlines by launching its inaugural tokenized fund on the Ethereum blockchain. Dubbed the BlackRock USD Institutional Digital Liquidity Fund, or BUIDL, this initiative is fully backed by cash, U.S. Treasury bills, and repurchase agreements. The fund offers investors an opportunity to earn U.S. dollar yields within the crypto space, marking a significant milestone in the convergence of traditional finance and digital assets.



With BlackRock looking forward to its spot Ethereum ETF, this isn’t the first time BlackRock has dipped its toes into the crypto waters.



ARK Invest



ARK Invest and 21Shares have jointly registered a spot Ether ETF. This innovative fund has commenced trading on the Cboe BZX Exchange, leveraging the CME CF Ether-Dollar Reference Rate – New York Variant.



ARK always expects a “power law distribution” within the cryptocurrency market. This theory posits that a select few cryptocurrencies will emerge to dominate the majority of value and market share—a concept that could reshape investment strategies in the digital asset realm.





The registration of the spot Ether ETF marks a significant step forward in providing investors with regulated exposure to Ethereum, the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization. The ETF is sponsored by 21Shares, with Delaware Trust Company serving as the trustee and Coinbase Custody Trust Company acting as the custodian.



Fidelity



As interest in cryptocurrency began to rise in the mid-2010s, Fidelity recognized the need to adapt to evolving investor preferences.



In response to the growing interest in cryptocurrency among investors, Fidelity, one of the largest asset managers and brokerages in the U.S., made a significant move into the digital currency space in mid-October 2018. The company launched Fidelity Digital Assets, a limited liability corporation aimed at serving institutional customers seeking exposure to the burgeoning cryptocurrency market.





Fidelity Digital Assets offers a range of services tailored to institutional clients, including offline cold storage custody solutions and trade execution. Leveraging its position as a major financial services firm, Fidelity aims to provide comprehensive digital asset investment solutions to financial institutions.



Recognizing the potential of blockchain technology in the financial sector, Fidelity further expanded its commitment to cryptocurrency by tasking the Blockchain Incubator section of its research and development team, known as the Fidelity Center for Applied Technology (FCAT), with exploring cryptocurrency investing solutions for institutional investors.



Invesco Galaxy



Galaxy Asset Management, a prominent player in the global digital assets investment landscape, boasts an impressive $5.3 billion in assets under management (AUM). The firm stands out for its commitment to providing investors with institutional-grade access to the dynamic digital assets ecosystem. Offering a diverse suite of over a dozen investment vehicles, Galaxy caters to a wide range of investment preferences, including passive, active, and venture strategies.





Invesco Ltd., on the other hand, is an established American independent investment management company headquartered in Atlanta, Georgia. With branch offices spanning across 20 countries, Invesco has cemented its position as a key player in the financial services sector. Notably, its common stock is a constituent of the S&P 500 index and is actively traded on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE).



Galaxy in partnership with Invesco to launch the Invesco Galaxy Bitcoin ETF (BTCO) in January. With their eyes on the crypto industry, they went ahead with the spot Ethereum ETF.



Hashdex



Hashdex has been carving pathways to prosperity since its establishment in 2018. With a mission to democratize access to the crypto ecosystem worldwide, Hashdex has garnered trust from investors, overseeing a substantial $849 million in client assets. These funds not only empower innovative investors but also facilitate their entry into the burgeoning crypto economy.



Among its notable ventures, Hashdex Group played a pivotal role in co-creating the Nasdaq Crypto Index (NCI), aimed at furnishing global investors with a dependable benchmark for the ever-evolving crypto asset class. In a landmark move in 2021, the group introduced the Hashdex Nasdaq Crypto Index ETF (HNCI), marking the inception of the world’s premier crypto index ETF.





Managing the fund assets for the Bitcoin Futures ETF is Tidal Investments LLC, an entity entrusted with the responsibility of navigating the intricate landscape of crypto investments. With a steadfast dedication to bridging the gap between traditional finance and the crypto space, Hashdex continues to spearhead initiatives that pave the way for the mainstream adoption of digital assets.



Grayscale



Founded in 2013, Grayscale made its mark by launching a Bitcoin trust in the same year, marking its entry into the digital currency investment realm. In 2015, the company became a subsidiary of Digital Currency Group, consolidating its position in the market. 



Notably, Grayscale Bitcoin Trust made history in 2015 by becoming the first publicly traded Bitcoin fund in the United States, trading over-the-counter on the OTCQX market. However, Grayscale’s fee structure, although higher than average compared to similar exchange-traded funds (ETFs), was justified by the company as necessary to cover the costs of trading Bitcoin.





Despite its pioneering efforts, Grayscale faced setbacks in its ambition to transition its Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) into an ETF. The company’s application in 2017 was met with negative feedback from the SEC, leading to a voluntary withdrawal. Nonetheless, perseverance paid off as Grayscale successfully completed the transformation after seven years.



Now, with its focus on Ethereum, Grayscale aims to capitalize on the growing interest in the cryptocurrency market. By pivoting towards spot ETFs for its Ethereum trust, Grayscale seeks to offer investors diversified opportunities to engage with digital assets in a regulated framework.



Franklin Templeton



Franklin Templeton, a stalwart in traditional finance circles, has taken a significant stride into the world of cryptocurrency, signaling a profound shift in the industry’s landscape. With a rich history spanning 77 years, the company boasts a staggering $1.5 trillion in assets under management, solidifying its position as a heavyweight in the asset management sector.



This embrace of crypto represents a departure from the traditional for Franklin Templeton, earning it the moniker of being “TradFi” incarnate. Earlier this year, the company made waves by launching the Franklin Bitcoin ETF (EZBC), joining the ranks of just ten spot Bitcoin ETFs presently listed in the United States.





In a bold display of its commitment to the crypto movement, Franklin Templeton adorned its iconic Ben Franklin logo with laser eyes, a symbol widely associated with fervent support for Bitcoin and the broader cryptocurrency ecosystem.



Franklin Templeton has also set its sights on expanding its ETF portfolio to include Ether. Alongside several other firms, Franklin Templeton has submitted spot Ethereum ETF proposals to the SEC, signaling its intent to capitalize on the growing demand for exposure to digital assets beyond Bitcoin.



Challenges of Ethereum ETF Applications



Industry experts express doubts regarding the likelihood of approvals arriving in May, as initially scheduled, for various reasons. Foremost among these concerns is the current state of Ether, the native cryptocurrency of the Ethereum blockchain, which is undergoing a process called staking. Staking involves cryptocurrency holders locking up their funds as collateral to support the network’s operations, in return for rewards in the form of additional cryptocurrency.



The potential classification of Ether as a security by the SEC) looms large, with significant implications not only for the token itself but also for the broader cryptocurrency markets. Should the SEC deem Ether security, it would necessitate compliance with securities laws, granting the SEC enhanced authority to regulate its trading and usage. Additionally, such a classification could pave the way for other cryptocurrencies to be labeled as securities, subjecting them to heightened regulatory scrutiny.



The prolonged delays in the SEC’s evaluation process have led industry experts to question the agency’s motives, drawing parallels with its historical approach in rejecting numerous Bitcoin (BTC) applications over the past decade. Consequently, the initial optimism surrounding Ethereum ETF applications has waned in recent weeks despite earlier forecasts predicting the approval of all filings by May 2024.



In light of the latest postponements by the SEC, analysts are now speculating that the regulatory body intends to reject all spot Ethereum ETF applications slated for review in May. This development marks a shift in sentiment within the industry, prompting stakeholders to reassess their expectations regarding the approval of Ethereum-based investment products.



Could There Be A Bright Future For Ethereum ETF Applications?



The SEC, notorious for its numerous delays in greenlighting spot Bitcoin ETFs, finds itself in a comparable predicament with spot Ethereum ETFs. Presently, the regulatory body is tasked with evaluating eight Ethereum ETF applications, each with distinct deadlines, awaiting their verdict.



The SEC’s current deadline to either approve or deny these spot Ethereum ETFs is set for the conclusion of May 2024. However, the SEC has extended its deadline for making a decision on the spot Ethereum ETF applications put forth by BlackRock and Fidelity. This extension stems partly from the SEC’s request for public input regarding the Fidelity and BlackRock ETF applications. Specifically, the SEC is soliciting public commentary on whether the proposed spot Ethereum ETFs might introduce vulnerabilities to market manipulation.



Ethereum ETF Applications: Is There Potential For New Breakthrough? 24



During the approval process for spot Bitcoin ETFs, certain applicants took the initiative to submit revised documents to the SEC, aiming to integrate insights gleaned from the public comment period. Eventually, the SEC granted approval to those applications. Should spot Ethereum ETF applicants follow suit and update their submissions to assimilate feedback, it could signal a positive indication that the SEC might incline towards approving their applications.



Conclusion



Recent developments have fueled speculation and skepticism alike. Many wonder whether the SEC will follow its precedent set with Bitcoin and approve Ethereum ETFs, or if a different stance will emerge. The approval of the Bitcoin ETF served as a significant milestone, marking the first time a cryptocurrency-based ETF gained regulatory approval in the United States. However, Ethereum’s case presents its own unique set of considerations.



The SEC’s decision regarding spot Ethereum ETFs carries profound implications for the broader market. Approval could signal growing acceptance and integration of cryptocurrencies within traditional financial systems. Conversely, a denial might dampen enthusiasm and prompt a reevaluation of the regulatory hurdles facing crypto-based financial products.

Why Is The Crypto Market Up Today?


The total market cap (TOTAL) along with Bitcoin (BTC) price observed recovery in the last 24 hours after the bearish few days. At the same time, Toncoin’s (TON) price also shot up by 16%, invalidating a crucial resistance. 
In the news today:-

Deutsche Bank Raised Concerns About Tether’s USDT, highlighting stability concerns. These concerns were in reference to Tether’s past regulatory issues.
Ripple, along with Hedera and Algorand, has become a founding member of the DerRec Alliance, which aims to simplify the process of securing and recovering digital assets and other secrets.

Total Market Cap Recovers
The total value of all cryptocurrencies was vulnerable to a decline below the support of $2.2 trillion. However, changing winds across the market resulted in a TOTAL recovery of 2.85%, adding more than $114 billion in a day.
At present, the total market capitalization is at $2.26 trillion, exhibiting the potential to flip $2.3 trillion and $2.4 trillion in resistance into support over the month.

However, since $2.3 trillion has acted as a strong resistance in the past, TOTAL could potentially witness a failed breach. This would keep the total market cap within the sub $2.2 trillion range.
Bitcoin Inches Close to $63,000
Bitcoin’s price witnessed considerable growth in a single day, which was rather necessary after the cryptocurrency nearly fell below $61,000. At the time of writing, BTC is trading at $62,880, nearing the resistance at $63,720.
Flipping it into support would also enable a breakout from the bullish flag pattern and result in a rise to $65,000 and beyond.

However, if the breach fails, Bitcoin would remain stuck in the flag, potentially falling back to $61,000 or below.
Toncoin Posts a Green Candle
Toncoin’s price action was on the rise with the broader market cues as the altcoin marked a 16.61% growth in the span of 24 hours. In doing so, TON also breached through the crucial resistance marked at $6.5 to trade at $6.7 at the moment.

If the rally continues, Toncoin would be able to flip the resistance at $7 into support, provided it cements $6.5 as a support floor.

But if these conditions fail and TON falls below $6.5 again, the altcoin could note a drawdown to $6. This would result in the invalidation of the bullish thesis.

FTX Creditors Reject Amended Compensation Plan Citing Controversial Exculpatory Clause and Undervalued Bitcoin Payments



                    

FTX’s recent amended proposal, which includes an exculpatory clause, has met with significant backlash from its creditors. 



Released on May 7, the proposal is aimed at compensating the creditors, including a noteworthy figure of “billions in compensation.” However, the inclusion of an exculpatory clause has become a major point of contention.




This specific clause would absolve Sullivan & Cromwell (S&C), the law firm managing FTX’s bankruptcy, from any liability for damages incurred during the bankruptcy process. 



S&C’s involvement in the company’s affairs, as it had previously served as outside counsel in various transactions, further complicates perceptions.



Sunil, a prominent FTX creditor and member of the FTX Customer Ad-Hoc Committee, which represents over 1,500 creditors, strongly criticized the clause. 




He highlighted that the clause would prevent S&C from being held accountable for potential misdeeds including “selling FTX assets at 70% to 90% discounts to their own clients and insiders.” 



On May 8, Sunil expressed his discontent on X, stating:



“S&C included an exculpation clause so they can not be held liable for misconduct — selling FTX assets at 70% to 90% discounts to their own clients and insiders (Ledger X, Galaxy), not restarting FTX 2.0, etc if we accept the plan.”



This controversy follows a lawsuit filed three months prior by top FTX creditors against S&C. 




The lawsuit accused the firm of actively participating in FTX’s “multibillion-dollar fraud” and profiting from these misdeeds. A February 16 court document illuminated the allegations:



“S&C knew of FTX US and FTX Trading Ltd.’s omissions, untruthful and fraudulent conduct, and misappropriation of Class Members’ funds. 



READ MORE: Coinbase Faces Class-Action Lawsuit Over Alleged Securities Deception



“Despite this knowledge, S&C stood to gain financially from the FTX Group’s misconduct and so agreed, at least impliedly, to assist that unlawful conduct for its own gain.”



The financial ties are further underlined by the fact that FTX owed S&C up to $1.45 billion in legal bankruptcy fees, a figure confirmed by compensation filings from December 2023.



The response from FTX’s creditors has been overwhelmingly negative, especially concerning the proposal’s payment plan. 



While FTX debtors have suggested a compensation formula based on a depreciated Bitcoin valuation of $16,800, critics argue this is grossly unfair given Bitcoin’s price increase since FTX’s collapse. 



BitGo CEO Mike Belshe commented on the matter in a May 8 X post:



“0% of FTX creditors agree that receiving $16800 for your bitcoin is fully compensated. I understand why the bankruptcy process needs to work this way but let’s not pretend victims are getting their money back or that FTX wasn’t as awful as it was.”



Given these circumstances, there’s a significant possibility that the amended plan will be rejected by the creditors, as further indicated by Rob, Paradex’s head of growth and a pseudonymous FTX creditor, who voiced his decision to reject the plan on May 8:



“Icing on the cake from the team that destroyed billions of potential value for FTX customers. This can’t be allowed. I’m voting NO on this plan.”

Bitcoin Miners Subsidy Surged With Ordinals And Runes


                                Applications To Solve Bitcoin Miners Subsidy Problems                                IntroductionSatoshi Nakamoto is a mysterious creator of Bitcoin who started the blockchain and stated that miners would make money through transaction fees one day. He also envisioned that miners would keep making money as and when these programs get better and more popular, and keep strengthening Bitcoin Mining.Challenges Faced by Bitcoin MinersIn the Cryptocurrency market after every halving event, Bitcoin miners face problems because they always get fewer rewards. This could be bad news for miners dependent on Bitcoin transaction fees. In January 2023,  before applications like the Ordinals protocol launched, miners depended on transaction fees to earn extra money. With every halving, it was difficult for the miners to earn a subsidy as it halves 210000 blocks which blocks the miners' revenue and makes them earn hardly.Role of Ordinals, Runes, and BRC-20The applications like Ordinals, Runes, and BRC-20s could help miners to stick towards the events like halving. According to big cryptocurrency mining groups, these programs could change things for miners and let them earn Bitcoin Transaction Fees. However, the mining revenue can be increased with an increase in Bitcoin (BTC) prices. As the applications layer comes into the line, further developments can be done so which creates new and improved software and encourages more people to use Bitcoin for different purposes. This could expand the overall activity on the network. In short, increased network activity leads to more transactions and more transactions automatically generate more fees for miners. Even if Block subsidy decreases miners could maintain stability in income due to diversification of income.After 20th April 2024, a later Bitcoin halving event occurred, Miners got a big boost as  840,000 blocks were mined worth $2.4 million with transaction fees recorded at 37.6 BTC transaction fee. This also shows that programs like halving can help the miners.Fluctuations in Miners Rewards and Unexpected RewardsThe reward of the 40.7 BTC is divided into two parts block subsidy and transaction fees. The Block subsidy is a fixed reward received by miners after successfully mining a new block where the new subsidy was 3.125 BTC, which is the amount awarded to miners for each new block mined after a halving event. The Block subsidy came from Memecoin and Non-Fungible Tokens. Memecoin competing to "inscribe rare satoshis" and fungible tokens using a new token standard called Runes.Transaction fees on the Bitcoin network surpass certain milestones such as 30, 40, or even 50 BTC. However, they were surprised to receive such a substantial reward during the halving block. Bitcoin miners earned $78.3 million in revenue, collectively where transaction fees cover a large portion. The fees earned by Bitcoin miners exceeded those earned by Ethereum stalkers and Uniswap liquidity providers on nine out of the last 20 days since the halving occurred. As the Bitcoin network continues to evolve and attract more users, the demand for transactions and the associated fees are expected to rise. There are fluctuations in miner revenue due to popularity of protocols like ordinals, Runes, and BRC-20 after the launch. These fluctuations introduced a kind of instability in miners' earnings. In 2016, big cryptocurrency mining groups gathered 3 halving events Ordinals, Runes, and BRC-20s with block 840000 marked the 37534th block mined in 2900 days.  Miners from 118 countries help them out, showing how Bitcoin mining is a global effort and highlighting mining groups' role as significant players in the industry.Also Read: Bitcoin Recorded One Billion Transactions On Bitcoin Network

We asked ChatGPT what will be SHIB price in 2025; Here’s what it said


Like many other assets in the cryptocurrency sector, Shiba Inu (SHIB) has been recording advances recently, adding up to its particularly successful year that saw it soar over 125%, and data compiled by the artificial intelligence (AI) platform ChatGPT suggests a wide trading range in the next year.
Indeed, Finbold asked ChatGPT-4, the most recent model of the OpenAI brainchild, to provide insights into the possible price range of Shiba Inu in 2025, taking into account expert opinions, historical price movements, indicators, and other relevant information from the viewpoint on May 10.
Shiba Inu price prediction
So, will Shiba Inu coin reach $1 any time soon? Not very likely, at least according to the information that ChatGPT has gathered from the internet’s most prominent crypto monitoring and forecasting websites. Nonetheless, a price increase is quite possible.


As it happens, the advanced generative AI tool has cited several such platforms, including CoinCodex, which has set a minimum price of SHIB to $0.000041 in 2025, “indicating a potential growth considering its current rate,” as ChatGPT further elaborated.
On top of that, it shared an even more bullish prognosis by WalletInvestor, which sees Shiba Inu on a “growth trajectory leading to $0.000061 in 2025, which suggests an upside potential or around 160% from its current price,” the AI chatbot observed.
Finally, it also provided a slightly less impressive, though still optimistic, forecast by Digital Coin Price, which has set the price of SHIB at $0.000029 by 2025, “demonstrating a 124% increase,” from its price at press time, as OpenAI’s celebrated product stated.
Furthermore, the bot offered a perspective that takes into account Shiba Inu’s all-time high (ATH) of $0.000039, which the popular dog meme token reached in October 2021 and hasn’t yet managed to surpass, even though many other assets in the crypto market have:

“SHIB saw an astronomical rise in 2021 but has experienced volatility typical of most cryptocurrencies. It’s important to consider that its historical peak was $0.000039, suggesting room for growth if market conditions are favorable.”

SHIB price analysis
For now, SHIB is trading at $0.00002335, marking a 3.56% increase on the day and adding up to the 1.51% advance across the past week, as the asset moves to recover from the 15.48% loss on its monthly chart while gaining 126.28% since the year’s turn.

Meanwhile, crypto expert and industry influencer Del Crxpto has recently declared that he knew inside Shiba Inu information that has led him to stock up on more SHIB, possibly referring to the fact that whatever major reveal was supposedly coming would trigger a SHIB rally.

All things considered, making specific SHIB price predictions is a challenging task, although insights provided by AI can help sort out and gauge the direction in which the crypto asset could move in the future. However, doing one’s own research and keeping up with any Shiba Inu news is essential.

Metaplanet Inc, a Japanese publicly traded firm that hopes to recreate the legacies of MicroStrategy in Asia, has acquired another tranche of Bitcoin (BTC). In an announcement shared on X, the firm has acquired a new tranche of 18.8698 BTC.The purchase was made on April 23, and it is valued at an aggregate amount of 200 million yen ($1.2 million). With this acquisition, the firm’s total Bitcoin holdings now come in at 117.7217 Bitcoin worth 10,193,536 yen per BTC. This Bitcoin bag is worth 1.2 billion yen, or $7,708,020. When Metaplanet started acquiring Bitcoin back in April, it triggered positive sentiment in Asia’s investment landscape. This sentiment was ignited in the United States back in August 2020, when MicroStrategy made its first Bitcoin purchase. Today, MicroStrategy is the second-largest corporate holder of Bitcoin after BlackRock Inc.Under the leadership of its Chairman Michael Saylor, MicroStrategy stacks Bitcoin regularly. Its last buy-up came in March when it acquired 12,000 BTC for $821.7 million. At the moment, the firm now holds a total of 214,246 tokens valued at around $14 billion. As U.Today reported earlier, MicroStrategy’s unrealized gain on its Bitcoin bet now comes in at $6.2 billion.MicroStrategy’s aggressive approach involves selling Convertible Senior Notes with the proceeds injected into the asset. Thus far, the move has paid off, and it remains unclear how long Metaplanet plans to sustain its strategy.Since Metaplanet joined the Bitcoin bandwagon, the price of BTC has generally slumped amid erratic sell-offs. However, with new mainstream firms reporting Bitcoin bets, bullish optimism has largely returned to the market. At the time of writing, the coin is seeing a mild recovery, up 3.14% in 24 hours to $62,907.50. With Metaplanet borrowing MicroStrategy’s playbook, it is likely to record similar bullish returns in the long term.

Controversial Ohio Commencement Speech Sparks Crypto Debate


							

Public reaction at Ohio State highlights the gap between crypto enthusiasts and broader understanding.



Effective communication is critical for bridging the gap between cryptocurrency fans and skeptics.



Stagnation in the crypto business requires fresh narratives and innovations to propel development.




As per Bloomberg report, the commencement speech at THE Ohio State University took a controversial twist as crypto entrepreneur Chris Pan’s remarks on Bitcoin were met with boos and jeers from the graduating class of 2024. 



Pan, who considers himself as a social entrepreneur, tried to explain the advantages of Bitcoin saying that it is an under-appreciated asset class because of the decentralized and finite nature. He highlighted current events, like the launches of Bitcoin ETFs by BlackRock and Fidelity, as the actual proof of cryptocurrency’s current mainstream acceptance and viability.



However, Pan’s speech backfired, highlighting a glaring disconnect between the crypto community and the broader public. While crypto enthusiasts often tout Bitcoin’s popularity among digital-native Gen Z, the negative reaction at the graduation ceremony suggests otherwise. This incident underscores the challenges crypto faces in gaining widespread acceptance and understanding.



Pan later clarified that his intention was not to promote Bitcoin, claiming he had only started learning about the cryptocurrency three months prior. He expressed regret for not emphasizing this point in his speech to make it more relatable to the audience. Despite the backlash, some argue that any publicity, even negative, could benefit the crypto industry, especially as it faces a lull in momentum.









Moreover, Pan emphasized that while some may assume he’s been immersed in the field for a decade, his actual entry coincided with the introduction of ETFs. Pan admitted he should have clarified this point to foster better understanding among the audience. He acknowledged that mentioning “Bitcoin” triggered a negative response, causing the subsequent points he made to fall flat. This experience, he noted, served as a valuable lesson for him. 



The cryptocurrency sector, which was previously fueled by many storylines and breakthroughs, is currently experiencing a period of stagnation. Projects that previously brought in billions of dollars are now suffering, and the industry is wondering where the next wave of users will come from. With prior storylines fading, the future of cryptocurrency remains unknown.

Jack Dorsey Issues Most Bullish BTC Forecast Yet, Says Price May Hit $1M By 2030



Dorsey’s bullish outlook for the long-term price action of Bitcoin borders on the collaborative nature of its ecosystem.

Twitter co-founder Jack Dorsey has issued a rather reaching Bitcoin (BTC) price prediction after claiming that the asset’s value should hit $1 million by the year 2030. He shared this in a Thursday interview with Pirate Wires’ Mike Solana, adding that there is every possibility that the price will grow even further from that point onward.
Dorsey’s bullish outlook for the long-term price action of Bitcoin borders on the collaborative nature of its ecosystem. According to him, even that is more interesting about Bitcoin than its price or its rich history. The head of the financial services firm Block explained how the ecosystem functions in a way that rewards collaboration, to ultimately improve the network for everyone involved. About Bitcoin and its ecosystem,  Dorsey said partly:




“…Anyone who works on it, or gets paid in it, or buys it for themselves, everyone who puts any effort in to make it better, is making the entire ecosystem better, which makes the price go up.”
Jack Dorsey’s BTC Prediction
Interestingly, Dorsey is now one of the very few people who have made such elaborate predictions about the coveted crypto asset. Ark Invest’s Cathie Wood has issued similar predictions in the past about Bitcoin hitting the $1 million mark by 2030. However, she got even more bullish in March, during an interview on the New Zealand Herald’s Markets with Madison online video show. In that interview, Wood said for the first time that a million-dollar-plus Bitcoin could happen before her past estimate of 2030.
It also appears that Dorsey’s views are borne out of personal conviction and not just for public records. Earlier this month, he shared, in a note to shareholders, that his fintech firm Block will pump 10% of its gross profit from Bitcoin-related products back into buying more BTC every month.
For Dorsey, $1 million is the least price achievable for BTC by 2030, and from there, it can only go upwards.
Departure from BlueSky
On May 6, reports filtered through that Dorsey was leaving the board of Bluesky, the decentralized social network he co-founded as an alternative to Twitter in 2019. However, he has now touched on the topic in this same interview, sharing what was the reason for his decision.
Dorsey claims that BlueSky was “literally repeating all the mistakes [Twitter] made”. In his opinion, the idea of true decentralization is lost in the protocol. Hence, it is just another app.

Coinbase to Take the Reins as BlockFi Announces Shutdown


On May 9, BlockFi, which was a popular crypto lending platform, announced the closure of its web platform. It is partnering with Coinbase, a US-based crypto exchange, to manage and distribute assets. However, BlockFi has not yet announced a specific shutdown date.
This move is a significant pivot for BlockFi. It has been navigating a complex financial situation since its late 2023 Chapter 11 bankruptcy filing.
What’s Next for BlockFi Customers?
According to the official statement, BlockFi will email clients detailed instructions on creating a Coinbase account. This will facilitate the transition. Clients who didn’t withdraw their digital assets by April 28, 2024, at 23:59 UTC and didn’t complete identity verification by May 10, 2024, at 23.59 UTC, will find their assets available in kind at Coinbase.

“For BlockFi clients who are unable to open a Coinbase account, all distributions will be made in cash, pursuant to the provisions of the Plan that require cash distributions where crypto distributions are not feasible,” BlockFi added.

BlockFi also encourages all clients to download their transaction history and other relevant documents.

Furthermore, the Plan Administrator can now choose Coinbase for future distributions. This includes any funds recovered from FTX.

BlockFi’s web platform shutdown announcement follows FTX revealing its updated repayment plan. The plan includes BlockFi as a “key stakeholder.”
FTX’s repayment to BlockFi will be based on the previously approved settlement. BlockFi reached a principal settlement with FTX and Alameda Research in March this year.
Under the settlement terms, FTX has pledged to prioritize a $250 million payment to BlockFi. This initial amount is part of a larger $874 million settlement. The settlement aims to compensate BlockFi for assets held on the FTX exchange and loans to Alameda Research.
This settlement stems from a close relationship between BlockFi and FTX. After the FTX fiasco in November 2022, BlockFi suspended withdrawals for its customer’s funds.

Exodus CEO frustrated as SEC delays listing amid celebrations

Exodus Movement, Inc. (Exodus) is facing a delay in its NYSE (New York Stock Exchange) American listing pending completion of the SEC’s review of its registration statement — which went into effect on April 28.The NYSE American previously approved the listing of Exodus’ shares of Class A common stock at a par value of $0.000001, expected to begin trading on May 9. However, due to the backpedal, Exodus’ transition from the OTCQX to the NYSE American will be put on hold until the SEC completes its regulatory compliance process.Source: https://twitter.com/exodus_io/status/1788403755160944799The delay in listing carries heavy implications for Exodus as the move to NYSE American would affect its visibility and potential financial market growth. This regulatory hurdle demonstrates a bottleneck crypto companies face when pursuing traditional finance (TradFi) regulated ventures. Exodus CEO, JP Richardson, expressed his surprise and confusion at the delay, stating:“We remain hopeful that the SEC will follow through on its commitment to treat us as the law intends. Exodus has been fully transparent and responsive throughout this process and we expect a swift resolution in this matter. In the meantime, we will continue to provide the best possible service and value for our customers and shareholders.” Richardson later explained that numerous employees and their families had gathered in New York City “to celebrate the moment.” “Every step of the way we’ve played by the regulatory rules given, and then at the 11th hour, the rules of the game were changed. It’s beyond frustrating” he said.Source: https://twitter.com/jprichardson/status/1788655686789824901Exodus explained that it may reconsider the decision to list again post-SEC review, depending upon the outcome, and that stockholders do not need to take any action at this time.Entrepreneur and crypto personality Lark Davis commented on the situation, stating that the SEC are “probably about to sue.” Source: https://twitter.com/TheCryptoLark/status/1788494152537358755Though potentially satirical in nature, Davis’ comment does highlight concerns within the crypto community — heightened by the recent United States House of Representatives vote to nullify the SEC’s anti-crypto banking guidance, SAB 121. The bipartisan bill, dubbed H.J.Res.109, was put to the House by Republican Party Representative Mike Flood and passed on May 8. Passing 228 to 182 votes, Flood described the SAB 121 as unfair on banks seeking crypto custody, due to custodial assets always being considered “off-balance sheet.”These legislative endeavours reflect upon the tension growing between financial institutions and regulatory entities as the crypto market progressively attempts to enter TradFi.

How to securely store crypto in software wallets

Software wallets enable crypto users to access digital assets at any time and from any location. However, the same connectivity also makes these wallets vulnerable to hacks and thefts. The security of software wallets is dependent on the user’s compliance with advised digital safety procedures and the wallet’s built-in security measures.Digital assets such as cryptocurrencies and nonfungible tokens (NFTs) face a plethora of security issues, such as malware designed to steal money and phishing schemes that try to obtain critical data. One needs to cultivate an adequate understanding of security standards to use software wallets safely.This article describes what software wallets are and how to choose the right software wallet. It discusses the process of installing a software wallet and how to manage it securely.Choosing the right software walletOne needs to be aware of the software wallets available and how they function to make an informed decision.Software wallets use private and public keys to facilitate the transmission, storage and management of digital assets. Public keys enable users to receive cryptocurrencies as wallet addresses, whereas private keys authorize transactions. While hardware wallets store funds physically, software wallets offer a digital interface to digital assets stored on the blockchain. Software wallets are broadly categorized into three types: desktop, mobile and web wallets. Desktop walletsA desktop wallet — e.g., Exodus — is basically an application that enables the user to securely store and manage private keys on a computer. If one sends or receives crypto payments frequently, a desktop wallet is a convenient option. Users connect desktop wallets to the internet when they need to make a transaction. They are usually noncustodial, which means that although the funds are fully in the control of the user, the onus to keep private keys secure is also on them.Mobile walletsA mobile wallet — e.g., Trust Wallet — is an application designed to be installed on a smartphone to access and operate digital assets. Such a wallet is convenient for on-the-go use and supports QR code scanning. Mobile wallets developed by a crypto exchange have the additional functionality of integration with the exchange.Web walletsWeb wallets — e.g., MetaMask — which are accessible via browsers, store private keys on a server. These wallets allow one to access their funds on the go, which makes them very convenient; however, there is an inherent security risk, as the keys are always online and the control is with a third party (a crypto exchange or enterprise). One needs to get a software wallet that facilitates ease of transactions while also adequately protecting their crypto holdings. The characteristics of various kinds of wallets need to be taken into account when choosing a crypto wallet.What to consider when selecting a software walletOne needs to factor in several aspects when choosing a software wallet:Security featuresTo deal with threat vectors, one needs to consider security features such as support for multiple signatures and two-factor authentication (2FA). As bad actors keep coming up with innovative ways to breach the security layer, the software wallet should get regular security upgrades.Supported cryptocurrenciesExplore the cryptocurrencies that the software wallet will accept. To avoid getting a new wallet every time to trade or store a currency, it is better to opt for a wallet that is compatible with a large number of digital assets.User interface (UI)Wallets with an easy-to-use UI enhance the user experience. Regardless of one’s level of skill, such wallets make managing digital assets simple.Setting up a software walletOne needs to set up the software wallet before they begin working with it. Here is the process of setting up a software wallet:Use the right sourceUsers need to make sure they download the official wallet from its official website, the App Store or the Google Play Store; otherwise, they could become vulnerable to phishing scams. They should double-check the website’s URL to confirm its legitimacy.Follow the installation instructions Whether it is a desktop, mobile or web application, the process should be straightforward. The user needs to give the necessary permissions when prompted, ensuring their device aligns with the wallet’s functionality. How to enhance software wallet securityTo ensure the secure storage of cryptocurrencies in software wallets, adopting advanced security practices is paramount: Store the seed phrase securelyWhen setting up the software wallet, the user needs to generate their seed phrase, which they could later need to access their crypto assets. It is a series of words that act as a master key to accessing funds. It is important for the user to keep it confidential, as anyone with access to the seed phrase will have access to funds. In the event one loses the seed phrase, the funds are irretrievable (if they also cannot remember their login password). In case the user loses access to the device or something breaks, they can restore access using the seed phrase. Use of password managersKeeping strong passwords for all financial applications is important. However, it creates another problem, as most find it hard to remember the different passwords they use on various websites. Password managers simplify the process of using and managing strong passwords. These applications keep wallet passwords in an encrypted vault that is secured with a master password.Password managers usually come with strong password generation features, which strengthen security by creating unique and difficult passwords. Moreover, the encryption implemented by these managers makes it exceedingly unlikely for unauthorized individuals to access stored data without the master password, which augments the protection.Two-factor authentication (2FA)Two-factor authentication (2FA) adds an additional security layer that goes beyond conventional login and password systems. Once users activate 2FA on software wallets, they might have to enter two different codes received via two different modes of communication in order to be verified. For instance, they might receive one code via email and another via smartphone. The application will grant access to the user only when they have entered the password and the two codes correctly. Even in the case that an attacker obtains the password, they are unlikely to get access to the email and the mobile device at the same time. The dual-verification system strengthens security against unauthorized access attempts. Multisignature walletsWallets with multiple signatures employ a cooperative security mechanism that requires consent from designated individuals prior to executing a transaction. This approach provides robust security to protect funds from abuse or unapproved access. Requiring independent approval from a predefined number of participants for each transaction provides a strong barrier against unauthorized activity.This method works well for any group that manages shared cryptocurrency holdings since it segregates the duty of safeguarding the wallet’s contents and improves security. By virtue of their joint authorization, multisignature wallets reduce the possibility of single points of failure.Biometric authenticationBiometrics in crypto wallets introduces an additional layer of security, ensuring that getting access to funds simply becomes improbable without the physical presence of the user. The mechanism leverages physical characteristics such as fingerprints, face IDs or iris scans to authenticate users. Integration of biometric authentication in crypto wallets effectively mitigates the vulnerabilities associated with password-based systems. The user experience becomes more convenient, as they can securely access their funds with a simple scan or touch. Update softwareThe user needs to keep their wallet software updated. Developers frequently release updates to patch vulnerabilities, add features, and improve security. A crypto wallet that isn’t regularly updated is more likely to fall prey to hackers’ tactics.Verify the authenticity of websitesThe user needs to be cognizant of phishing attempts and malicious websites that aim to steal information from their device. They need to verify the authenticity of the websites they browse before entering any sensitive information regarding their crypto wallet.Avoid public WiFiWhen accessing a wallet or conducting transactions, one needs to use a secure and private internet connection. Public WiFi networks are often unsecured, making them hotspots for attackers looking to intercept data. Find the balance between security and convenienceSettling somewhere between security and convenience is important when it comes to software wallets.One needs to select a reliable software wallet, protect recovery phrases, and be on top of potential security threats. Ticking all these checkpoints will ensure the security of one’s digital assets.

X launches AI-curated audiences for advertisers

The business account for social media platform X announced a new feature for advertisers enhanced by artificial intelligence (AI). On May 10, the platform said its “AI Audience” feature will be coming soon. This feature will allow advertisers to briefly describe their target audience for the given ad, then allow X’s AI systems to generate a pool of “the most relevant X users” to that target in a matter of seconds.  


It gave the example of a user inputting the target audience as “Technology Leaders” with the description “users who are leaders in technology.” In seconds, the AI generated a list with hundreds of users in the target audience, along with statistics for the demographic. The post was reposted by X owner Elon Musk, though without any additional comment on the development. Meanwhile, in response to the initial post, one user commented that this would be a “gamer changer” for the world of advertising and “value for your money” on the platform. He questioned, however, how good the AI is at targeting accurate audiences. If the AI proves efficient over time at correctly identifying target audiences, this move could put X ahead of other platforms when it comes to advertising, as other platforms would still require research for targeting correct audiences. However, other users were concerned about the AI reinforcing and perpetuating biases and stereotypes. Source: Crypto SignalsAnother user questioned what exactly X is selling and “to whom.” The user said, “I thought I am the one paying so X doesn’t have to pimp me to brands and sell me to corporations.” Despite some skepticism, many users called the development “exciting” and “really smart.” Related: Elaborate Elon Musk deepfake crypto fraud uncovered in Hong KongThis development comes amid Musk’s proactive stance on integrating AI into the social media platform. On March 26, Musk announced that X’s own AI model, Grok, would be accessible to all premium X subscribers. On March 29, the next version of the model, Grok-1.5, was announced. It is said to have “improved reasoning capabilities” and a context length of 128,000 tokens.Amid a lawsuit between Musk and OpenAI, with which he formerly had ties, on March 11, the X owner said that he would be making Grok open-source.Although Musk’s AI company xAI has been actively developing new tools for mass use, in January, Musk denied the accuracy of a report that claimed xAI had secured $500 million of its $1 billion investment goal.Magazine: How to stop the artificial intelligence apocalypse: David Brin, Uplift author

Kraken counters SEC’s legal interpretation in dismissal motion

In its legal defense against a lawsuit from the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), Kraken has filed a reply refuting the agency's allegations of trading unregistered securities, arguing that the case lacks precision and misinterprets fundamental legal concepts.In its response filing, Kraken identifies discrepancies in the SEC’s argument, noting the agency’s failure to accurately identify investment contracts traded on the exchange. Additionally, Kraken argues that the SEC’s use of terms like “investment concept” and “ecosystem” instead of “investment contract” and “enterprise” reflects a misunderstanding of the case’s legal framework.The SEC initially sued Kraken in November 2023, alleging it unlawfully made millions of dollars from “crypto asset securities” transactions and provided “exchange, broker, dealer, and clearing agency” services without having registered with the agency “as required by law.” This was months after settling charges over Kraken’s former staking service.Kraken’s reply to the SEC in support of the motion to dismiss. Source: CourtListenerHowever, Kraken filed a motion to dismiss, contending that it establishes a “dangerous precedent” for the agency’s jurisdiction. In response, the SEC filed a 39-page opposition to Kraken’s motion to dismiss, saying, “It is simply not the case that this enforcement action exceeds the authority Congress granted the SEC.”In the Thursday, May 9 motion, Kraken contests the SEC’s claim that written contracts are required in investment agreements, emphasizing that contracts can be oral, expressed or implied. Kraken argues that the SEC’s efforts to refute unaddressed arguments indicate a misunderstanding of the case’s central points.Related: SEC has taken ‘too expansive’ a view of crypto, says former commissionerKraken references past SEC cases involving initial coin offerings to support its stance. The exchange emphasized that these cases centered on contractual rights and obligations, supporting Kraken’s view of investment contracts. Kraken’s motion hinges on interpreting the SEC’s jurisdiction using the Howey test, which defines a security based on specific criteria, such as the investment of capital in a common enterprise with the expectation of profit, driven by the efforts of others.The U.S. Congress is currently deliberating on crypto regulation with several ongoing bills. Concurrently, eight state attorneys general in the U.S. have filed a joint amicus brief, contending that the SEC exceeded its delegated authority in the lawsuit against the cryptocurrency exchange Kraken.Magazine: ‘Crypto is inevitable’ so we went ‘all in’ — Meet Vance Spencer, permabull

Top Bitcoin (BTC) Predictions: Renewed Bull Run or a Plunge Below $55K?


																TL;DR

Bitcoin has rebounded past $63,000 with predictions suggesting it might reach near $110,000 by the end of the year, influenced by factors like the recent halving which typically precede major rallies.
While some analysts expect potential drops, prominent figures project extremely optimistic long-term values for Bitcoin, with forecasts up to $1 million.


BTC’s Next Possible Move?
After trading in the red for a few days, the primary cryptocurrency headed north on May 10, surpassing the $63,000 mark. Many analysts believe the uptick will continue in the following months and lead to unseen peaks.
One person supporting that thesis is the popular X user Titan of Crypto. The trader observed the Fibonacci circles on BTC’s price chart, assuming that the cycle’s top of almost $110,000 may occur by the end of this year. 
“It’s a conservative price prediction. I think it’ll exceed it,” the analyst added.
Captain Faibik and Mikybull Crypto were also bullish. The former claimed that BTC is still in a consolidation phase and a breakout “is just a matter of time.” The trader predicted that the next green wave will push the asset’s value to $78,000.
Mikybull Crypto suggested that Bitcoin is in “final preparation for a post-halving massive rally.” Recall that the asset’s latest halving (which slashed the rewards to miners for validating blocks on the blockchain in half) occurred less than a month ago. 




The event has historically resulted in a huge resurgence for the entire cryptocurrency market, with many industry participants expecting the same scenario in the coming months.
It is worth noting that some analysts outlined somewhat bearish predictions. Such is the example of Michael van de Poppe, who believes BTC could drop to the $52,000-$55,000 range should it plunge below the major support zone of $61,000.
The Ultimate Bulls
Other prominent figures, including Robert Kiyosaki, Adam Back, Michael Saylor, and Cathie Wood, have presented much more optimistic BTC price forecasts over the past few years.
Two months ago, the author of the best-seller “Rich Dad, Poor Dad” projected that the asset’s value could soar to $300,000 by the end of 2024. He later changed his prediction to $100,000.
Adam Back, CEO of Blockstream, chipped in six months ago, envisioning a rally to a whopping $700,000 in the near future. He also assumed that BTC’s market cap may surpass that of physical gold. As of the moment, the cryptocurrency’s market cap stands at approximately $1.25 trillion, whereas the yellow metal has almost $16 trillion.
The most bullish predictions came from Michael Saylor (Executive Chairman of MicroStrategy) and Cathie Wood (CEO of Ark Invest). They both see BTC trading at $1 million sometime in the future.

Pair linked to crypto investor kidnapping hand themselves in


A father-son duo handed themselves over to Hong Kong police on Wednesday after their family car was linked to the kidnapping of a crypto investor.  
According to the South China Morning Post, the 55-year-old crypto investor was reportedly taken from her car by four captors and bundled into the back of the car on Tuesday. She was with her husband at the time, but he was reportedly attacked with a stun gun when he tried to intervene. 
A source familiar with the case told the SCMP on Thursday that a 70-year-old businessman and his 30-year-old son were arrested at Tai Po Police Station the next day. They told SCMP that the businessman invested HK$15 million ($1.9 million) in crypto 18 months ago through the kidnapped woman.

According to the source, after investing, the businessman was apparently unable to retrieve his money or contact the woman. 
The source stressed that the arrested father-son duo were not the captors involved with the kidnapping. Police say they are still searching for more suspects.  
The father-son duo were reportedly arrested on suspicion of false imprisonment and assault and were still being questioned on Thursday morning.

Jack Dorsey Predicts Bitcoin Price To Hit At Least $1M By 2030: 'Hits That Number And Goes Beyond' - Benzinga

Jack Dorsey, Former CEO of social media giant Twitter, now X, made a super bullish prediction for Bitcoin BTC/USD, describing it as a fascinating ecosystem and movement. What Happened: Responding to a question posed by journalist Mike Solana on his Pirate Wires site about Bitcoin's price in 2030, Dorsey said he expects the digital asset to hit “at least a million,” and go beyond. The entrepreneur who set up one of the biggest social networks noted that Bitcoin's price isn't the most interesting aspect of the asset, but how it is expanding due to coordinated efforts by different stakeholders. “I don’t know. Over… at least a million. I do think it hits that number and goes beyond.”"The most amazing thing about Bitcoin, apart from the founding story, is anyone who works on it, or gets paid in it, or buys it for themselves — everyone who puts any effort in to make it better — is making the entire ecosystem better, which makes the price go up," Dorsey remarked. Through the course of the conversation, Dorsey made more references to Bitcoin, at one instance praising its decentralized ideals. "It’s like Bitcoin, it doesn't have one leader or one central chokehold element. And I think that’s critical for what it's intended to do."Why It Matters: The world's largest digital asset has jumped 50% since the year began, with optimism buoyed significantly by the introduction of Bitcoin spot ETFs. With easier access to the cryptocurrency market, institutional investors have jumped on the bandwagon, leading to $11.76 billion in cumulative net inflows into these products, according to SoSo Value. The soaring interest has led many influential names to come up with predictions that are, at times, unrealistic. Ark Invest CEO Cathie Wood recently forecasted that one Bitcoin would hit $3.8 million by 2030. Note that Ark Invest operates its own Bitcoin spot ETF, which has attracted $2 billion in net inflows as of this writing. As a result, her estimates may involve a conflict of interest.Price Action: At the time of writing, Bitcoin was trading closer to $63,000, following a 2.73% growth in the last 24 hours, according to data from Benzinga Pro.Read Next: Telegram-Linked Toncoin Price Soars, But So Do Scams As Hackers Steal $140K Worth Of Tokens From Unsuspecting UsersImage Via Shutterstock

Here’s When Bitcoin Could Bottom Out Based on Historical Precedent, According to Analyst Benjamin Cowen - The Daily Hodl


								Widely followed crypto analyst Benjamin Cowen is offering his outlook on when Bitcoin (BTC) could potentially bottom out as the flagship digital asset hovers around $63,000.
In a new video update, Cowen tells the 801,000 subscribers of his YouTube channel that the current Bitcoin price action resembles that which followed the crypto king’s second halving event eight years ago more so than the halving in 2020.










“It looks to me like it’s mimicking 2016 a lot more than the other two cycles, which kind of makes sense. I mean a lot of people who’ve been following Bitcoin for a while have been comparing this cycle more so to the 2016 cycle than the one in 2020.”
Source: Benjamin Cowen/X
According to Cowen, the flagship crypto asset could potentially hit the cycle bottom over the coming weeks based on the Bitcoin Return on Investment (ROI) After Halving metric. The Bitcoin ROI After Halving metric is the ratio of the current price relative to the price of BTC at the time of halving. The latest halving, which cuts miners’ rewards in half every four years, occurred on April 19th.
“If you look at 2016, which might be relevant to compare to, you can see that Bitcoin didn’t durably get back above an ROI of one until about three and a half months after the halving.
And I don’t know if it’s going to play out like that or not, but you can see that that would be more evidence of a summer low. That could potentially be more evidence for a summer low if you look at Bitcoin’s ROI as a measure from the halving and compare it to the 2016 cycle.”

Bitcoin is trading for $62,798 at time of writing, a fractional increase during the last 24 hours.

Metaplanet Increases Bitcoin Holdings, Acquiring Additional 19.87 BTC | Coinspeaker



Metaplanet’s shift to Bitcoin is a significant step for the crypto community; it signals a growing trend of institutional adoption of cryptocurrencies.

Metaplanet, a Japan-based Web3 company, recently announced that it has purchased additional Bitcoin worth ¥200 million, which is equivalent to $1.25 million.
This move by the company follows up on its recent acquisition of the digital asset towards the end of last month. Just a few weeks ago, the Japanese company announced that it had acquired ¥1 Billion worth of BTC, which is about $6.25 million. Although the latest purchase is quite lower than the previous one, it is still a move toward establishing itself as a major force in the digital asset industry.




According to the post on its X page, Metaplanet purchased 19.87 BTC at an average price of 10,065,548 yen per Bitcoin, amounting to 200 million yen. In the released ‘Progress of Disclosure,’ the company stated that its current total BTC holdings are around 117.7 BTC. This investment strategy demonstrates the Japan-based company’s confidence in the coin’s growth and long-term viability and its potential to be widely accepted as a legitimate asset.
Metaplanet announced in early April that it would be embracing BTC as its core treasury asset, which further demonstrates the company’s goal of keeping up with trends and innovation within the finance space. It also positions the company as a leader in the digital finance era and a pioneer in the adoption of virtual assets in Japan. The post stated:
“Our transition to Bitcoin is a significant milestone in our mission to lead in the digital finance era and positions Metaplanet as a pioneer in the adoption of digital assets in Japan. Stay tuned!”
Institutional Investment to Boost Bitcoin Legitimacy and Price
It could be recalled that after the company announced its first acquisition of $6.56 million worth of Bitcoin, an instant effect was seen in its stock price, which surged 90% in just 48 hours. As of now, its price has increased by over 3% in 24 hours, which also reflects the positive impact of the growing influence of cryptocurrencies on the traditional financial market.
Just as Metaplanet’s stock value is increasing, BTC has seen a rise from the slump it experienced earlier, when it dropped to $56,000. With the price still hoping for a major recovery, it currently trades at around $62,000—also a 3% increase in the last 24 hours.
Metaplanet’s shift to Bitcoin is a significant step for the crypto community; it signals a growing trend of institutional adoption of cryptocurrencies. Hence, as more Web3 companies move their assets to the BTC, its legitimacy will be strengthened as a store of value and a hedge over inflation. More so, the influx of large institutions into the crypto sector will also have an impact on the price of this digital asset, which will propel its value to surge more.

Is 'undervalued' ARB's bottom finally in? Metrics say... - AMBCrypto



ARB’s key metric presented a buying opportunity on the charts
Bearish sentiments retained dominance across the market though

The Market Value to Realized Value (MVRV) ratio of leading Layer 2 (L2) token Arbitrum [ARB] has flashed a buy signal on the charts. In fact, AMBCrypto found that the native token’s MVRV ratio assessed over the 30-day and 365-day moving averages returned negative values, at press time.
Source: Santiment
An asset’s MVRV ratio tracks the difference between its current market price and the average price of every coin or token acquired for that asset. 
When its value is positive and above one, the asset is said to be overvalued. This means that the asset’s current market value is significantly higher than the price at which most investors acquire their holdings. Conversely, a negative MVRV value shows that the asset is undervalued. It suggests that the market value of the asset in question is below the average purchase price of all its tokens that are in circulation. 
It is regarded as a perfect time to buy when an asset’s MVRV ratio is negative because, at that point, the asset trades at a discount relative to its historical cost basis.
No price bottom in sight
A good indicator of whether an asset’s price is due for a rally is when a local price bottom has been reached. This is correctly measured by assessing metrics such as an asset’s Age Consumed.
This metric measures the movement of dormant tokens. For its part, ARB’s Age Consumed metric has projected slightly low values since the beginning of May. 
Source: Santiment
Here, it is important this because it offers insight into the shifts in the behavioral patterns of the token’s long-term holders. This group of ARB holders rarely moves their old coins around, and when they do, it often precipitates a shift in market trends. 
When ARB’s Age Consumed metric spikes, it means that many tokens are changing hands after being left idle for an extended period. On the other hand, when it falls, it means that idle coins are left unmoved. 

Realistic or not, here’s ARB’s market cap in BTC’s terms

Since the beginning of May, ARB’s Age Consumed has returned low values – A sign that its long-term holders have barely moved their tokens around. 
This could also indicate that a price bottom is yet to be reached. Ergo, traders should tread with caution, despite the buy signal flashed by ARB’s MVRV ratio.
Additionally, ARB’s price movements observed on the 1-day chart revealed that bearish sentiments remain significant. 
Source: ARB/USDT on TradingView
At press time, ARB’s price rested below its 20-day simple moving average (SMA), confirming the risk of further decline.
When an asset’s price falls below its 20-day SMA, it suggests that the short-term trend for the asset is downward. Traders interpret this as a sign that sellers are in control and that the asset’s price will likely continue declining.
Likewise, the token’s Relative Strength Index (RSI) returned a value of 37.31 – A sign that market participants have been favoring ARB distribution over its accumulation.

Toncoin investors get opportunity with Notcoin: Is Bitbot next? - CoinJournal



                    

                    
Toncoin price surged by more than 13% amid news around new project Notcoin (NOT).
Binance and OKX among exchanges to list NOT token.
Bitbot could be the game-changer for Telegram crypto traders

As Toncoin (TON) gains ahead of the upcoming Notcoin (NOT) trading debut, investors keen on the Telegram ecosystem have their eyes on Bitbot – a potentially market-defining solution that’s attracting massive attention in its ongoing presale.
Here’s more about Notcoin and what makes Bitbot (BITBOT) a likely contender for the next big thing in the Telegram crypto space.
Toncoin gains as Binance, OKX announce Notcoin listing
Toncoin’s emergence as a top altcoin continues and the price of TON is making another huge leap to enhance this outlook.
As highlighted previously, Toncoin has gained a lot of momentum due to developments around Telegram, the leading cross-platform messaging app with over 900 million users.
In recent weeks and months, TON price has surged after news that venture capital firm Pantera Capital was making an investment in the TON blockchain. Stablecoin giant Tether’s launch of USDT on the blockchain sparked a 18% spike in April, while Telegram’s support for TON payouts from ads for channel owners was also a big catalyst for TON price.
This state of the TON blockchain is encouraging investors and could catalyse further gains for the Telegram-related coin.
In the past 24 hours, TON price has gained by more than 14% to reach highs of $6.91. That’s about 10% off Toncoin’s all-time high of $7.63 reached on April 11 this year.
What is Notcoin (NOT)?
Notcoin is a community token on Telegram that has gained widespread adoption amid a viral Web3 game. NOT is the native token that allows users to explore, play, and contribute to the project’s growth.
Two of the world’s largest crypto exchanges by trading volume – Binance and OKX – have announced support for NOT. The token will be listed for trading on these and other exchanges on May 16, with OKX opening NOT deposits on May 10 at 3:00 am UTC.
Binance has added NOT as the 54th project on its Launchpool, allowing the community to farm NOT by staking BNB and FDUSD.
One notable thing is that Notcoin has a total supply of 102,719,221,714, and circulating supply when NOT lists will be 100% of total supply.
As anticipation for Notcoin’s trading debut builds, Toncoin is likely to rise amid investors rush to grab a potential gem.
Bitbot: Is this the “next big thing” in crypto?
Bitbot’s entry into the market could change the game for cryptocurrency traders looking to tap into an AI-powered trading bot.
At the core of its potential dominance is the combination of advanced institutional grade trading tools and the world’s first non-custodial trading solution.
Bitbot stands out as users have full control of their wallets, private keys and assets, which is not the case with other bots. This feature means Bitbot has user security as a top priority and traders are eagerly anticipating its launch after the presale ends.
What else makes Bitbot stand out?
The excitement that surrounds Bitbot could also be related to the Gem Scanner. What this AI-powered tool does is to leverage artificial intelligence to pick potential opportunities.
The platform’s unique revenue-sharing mechanism, which provides for 50% of app fees to be distributed to BITBOT holders, could be another reason why traders are upbeat about this project.
Just as Notcoin, Bitbot eyes listing on top crypto exchanges and investors see the presale as a great opportunity to buy.
The project’s total supply is 1 billion BITBOT, 30% of this set for presale and 23% for community rewards.
Currently, gem hunters have allocated more than $3.2 million to BITBOT in stage 13. Details on the presale page shows token sale price is $0.018, which could be a huge advantage for an early bird.

$1.1B Worth of Bitcoin Options Set to Expire Today, What's Next? | Coinspeaker



The open interest (OI) for Bitcoin call options is twice the open interest for the put options, indicating an overall bullish sentiment.

It is Friday, and crypto market enthusiasts will be closely observing Bitcoin options expiry, and the possible movements in BTC price going ahead. Approximately 18,000 BTC options are nearing expiration, featuring a Put Call Ratio of 0.64 and a Maxpain point set at $62,000. This week’s expiring BTC contracts hold a notional value of approximately $1.15 billion, slightly less than the previous week’s expiry.
This put/call ratio of 0.64 suggests that more long contracts, or calls, would be expiring in comparison to the short contracts, or puts. Furthermore, the Bitcoin open interest has also surged to $700 million at the strike price of $70,000 and $100,000, which clearly hints that the longs are in a dominating position. On the other hand, the Open Interest (OI) for put calls has also surged to $360 million.




However, it is clear that the open interest (OI) for Bitcoin call options is twice the open interest for the put options, indicating an overall bullish sentiment. Call options provide the holder with the privilege to buy the underlying asset at a predetermined price on or before a specified date.
Additionally, trading firms such as QCP Capital and Paradigm have noticed a resurgence in demand for upward call options. This includes buyers closing current positions to transition into higher strike calls set to expire in July and September.
A Look At Bitcoin Options Implied Volatility (IV)
As per the data from Greeks.Live, the crypto market experienced a downturn over the last week amid the drop in the trading volume. Although there was a reduction in outflows from the US Bitcoin ETF, the market structure and block trading indicated persistent weakness in prices.
This downward trend has contributed to diminishing confidence among investors, reflected in the decreasing implied volatility (IV) across major terms. Presently, IV levels are marginally below the historical average, signaling some support. However, there is limited scope for further decline at this juncture.
“Empirically May has not been a good month for the market, and it is good value for money to buy some monthly puts now” Greeks.live notes.


In the last 24 hours, Bitcoin price has bounced back from under $61,000 levels and is currently trading close to $63,000. If BTC price gives a strong breakout above $64,000, we can see the levels of $70,000 coming soon.

In a recent development, Deutsche Bank, one of the largest and most influential banks globally, has issued a significant warning regarding stablecoins.The warning highlights potential risks associated with this class of digital assets, delving into the topic of increasing the importance of the cryptocurrency ecosystem.Stablecoins, a type of cryptocurrency pegged to traditional fiat currencies like the U.S. dollar or euro, have gained widespread popularity in recent years. A new class of stablecoins, algorithmic stablecoins, use algorithms to maintain a stable price relative to another asset or basket of assets. These digital assets offer the promise of stability amid the volatility of cryptocurrencies, making them attractive for various use cases, including remittances, payments and decentralized finance (DeFi) applications.However, a recent report from Deutsche Bank has cast a shadow over this perceived haven, issuing a stark warning about stablecoins, including the widely used Tether (USDT).The research, which examined 334 currency pegs since the year 1800, found that only 14% have survived. Applying this to the world of stablecoins, Deutsche Bank Research analysts believe that the majority of these pegged digital currencies will become unmoored."Some may survive, although most will likely fail," the analysts wrote on Tuesday.Terraform Lab's algorithmic stablecoin TerraUSD and its sister token Luna collapsed two years ago, wiping away at least $40 billion in cryptocurrency. According to Deutsche Bank researchers, the few successful pegged currencies that survived did so because they were credible, backed by reserves and functioned in carefully controlled institutions, which they say many major stablecoins lack.Deutsche Bank's warning comes at a time when stablecoins are experiencing unprecedented growth and usage, with their total market capitalization surpassing significant milestones.Tether, the first and largest stablecoin by market cap, disagrees with Deutsche Bank's assessment, claiming that the research lacks clarity and sufficient evidence.

Hoskinson Critiques Biden's Crypto Stance Amid Election Season


In an almost 15-minute video, Charles Hoskinson, co-founder of Ethereum (ETH) and founder of Cardano (ADA), shared his views on President Joe Biden’s administration’s stance towards the crypto industry.
Hoskinson highlights the statement from Biden’s administration regarding H.J. Res 109. This resolution is against the Securities and Exchange Commission’s (SEC) Staff Accounting Bulletin (SAB) 121.
Hoskinson Speaks Out Against Biden’s Crypto Regulations
SAB 121 is particularly interesting for the crypto community since it requires financial institutions to include customers’ digital assets on their balance sheets. Critics see this as a major operational and financial hurdle.
The White House claimed rejecting this rule would weaken the SEC’s investor and financial system protections. They strongly stated, “if the President were presented with H.J. Res. 109, he would veto it.”

In response to the current situation, Hoskinson called the idea of regulating crypto under the Securities Act of 1933 “an absurd statement.”


“Cryptocurrencies can be commodities, securities, currencies, loyalty points, non-fungible tokens. All at the same time. So, how do you do these asset regulations when things can move on daily, weekly, monthly basis? In fact, circumstances can change over time,” Hoskinson explained.

Hoskinson also warned that the US might lose all its cryptography experts. He speculated they might move to regions like China and the Middle East. There, adversaries could “weaponize” them against the US.
However, Hoskinson mentioned that there’s nothing Joe Biden could do to eliminate Bitcoin or cryptocurrencies entirely. Concluding his speech, Hoskinson emphasized the importance of voting for crypto in the upcoming November elections.

“In November, vote crypto and understand who isn’t voting crypto,” he urged.

A crypto community member then challenged Hoskinson. They said the previous administration wasn’t exactly crypto-friendly either. Yet, Hoskinson disagreed.

“You’re completely wrong. The administration had its issues but mostly ignored our industry. The Biden administration has engaged in a coordinated effort to kill crypto,” he replied.

In an interesting turn of events, former US President Donald Trump recently expressed his comfort with crypto. He did so at a special event for his “Mugshot Edition” NFT holders in Florida.


“And if you like crypto, […] if you’re in favor of crypto, you better vote for Trump,” he said.

Additionally, Trump announced his campaign would accept cryptocurrency donations. This announcement sparked interest online. Yet, it awaits further details from his campaign staff.
The crypto community welcomed Trump’s support. Plan B, a renowned crypto analyst, expressed his thoughts.

“If Trump embraces crypto and restores basic human rights […] then he gets 50% of votes and wins the November 2024 elections!” PlanB wrote.


The differing views of Joe Biden and Donald Trump on crypto are notable. This is especially true as the US presidential election approaches.

Toncoin (TON) Price Surges 14% after Binance Announced Listing of Notcoin (NOT) with Seed Tag | Coinspeaker



Telegram-backed Toncoin (TON) has been the best-performing top-ten crypto project in the past few weeks.

Toncoin (TON), the native cryptocurrency for The Open Network blockchain that is backed by the Telegram social network, spiked as much as 14 percent in the past 24 hours to trade around $6.9 on Friday during the mid-London session. The Toncoin (TON) project has grown to a top-tier layer one (L1) blockchain, with more than $259 million in total value locked (TVL).
Remarkably, the Toncoin project has managed to outshine some veteran Web3 chains like Cardano (ADA), Tron (TRX), and Avalanche (AVAX), among others. As of this writing, Toncoin had a fully diluted valuation of about $35 billion and a daily average traded volume of around $672 million.




Toncoin Growth Backed by the Telegram Platform
As Coinspeaker had previously pointed out, the Toncoin economy is heavily anchored in the Telegram social networking platform. With Telegram having nearly 200 million daily active users (DAU), the Toncoin ecosystem is well-positioned to grow rapidly in the confirmed crypto bull market.
For instance, the Telegram-based community token, Notcoin (NOT), which enables seamless onboarding of users to the web3 ecosystem via a tap-to-earn mining mechanism, has received tremendous support and adoption. On Thursday, leading cryptocurrency exchange Binance Holdings Ltd announced that its users can begin farming the NOT meme coin on May 13 through staking BNB and FDUSD into separate pools.
Binance announced that Notcoin will be the 54th project on the Binance Launchpool, with trading set to begin on May 16. The trading of NOT tokens will be facilitated by Bitcoin, Tether USDT, BNB, and FDUSD.
The listing of NOT tokens on Binance follows similar decisions by other top-tier crypto exchanges such as Bybit, and OKX.
The Toncoin ecosystem consists of a vibrant web3 ecosystem of more than 700 applications including wallets, and exchanges to facilitate seamless crypto adoption. As a result, the Toncoin network has amassed more than 17.9 million addresses since inception led by those from the Jetton wallet.
The Toncoin network offers passive income through staking, whereby around 549 million TON coins have been staked to date.
TON Price Action and Midterm Targets
Toncoin price has heavily leveraged the notable altcoin speculation amid the confirmed crypto bull market. Earlier last month, TON price reached an all-time high (ATH) of about $7.63, following a successful bullish breakout at the beginning of this year.
If TON’s bullish momentum continues in the coming weeks, the altcoin will inevitably print a new ATH soon. Moreover, the altcoin has gained more than 29 percent in the last week despite Bitcoin and Ethereum prices lacking in bullish momentum.
With the TON price against the US dollar on the daily chart having rebounded on the 50 SMA and 50 RSI, there is a high chance of a bullish continuation. From a technical standpoint, the TON price could easily reach the next liquidity range between $9.6 and $12.6, which coincides with the 1.618 and 2.618 daily Fibonacci Retracement.

Kraken Asks California Court to Dismiss SEC Case over Legal Jurisdiction and Misinterpretation | Coinspeaker



Kraken contends the SEC interpretation of the Howey Test and asks the court to dismiss the case against the exchange.

Attorneys representing the Kraken exchange have replied to the United States Securities and Exchange Commission’s (SEC) April filing, and asked the court to dismiss allegations against the exchange. Filings submitted Thursday in the Northern District of California argue that the SEC’s case stating that Kraken is running an unregistered securities exchange is fundamentally flawed.
Kraken Questions SEC’s Legal Jurisdiction
The exchange’s recent reply accuses the SEC of stretching the case by extending the SEC’s jurisdiction past limits set by the Howey test, used to determine what assets qualify as securities. Essentially, the Howey test sets four criteria: investment of money, in a common enterprise, expectation of profit, and derived from the efforts of others. Kraken’s lawyers stated:




“The SEC cannot satisfy Howey’s additional requirements that there be investments of money in a common enterprise with a reasonable expectation of profits based on the efforts of others. This would gut Howey by significantly expanding the SEC’s jurisdiction to a host of investment activities that were never delegated to the agency. Such a significant reordering of the US’s financial regulatory structure should be debated in Congress, not in the courts.”
Kraken’s reply also notes that the SEC is misinterpreting legal concepts, and questions the use of “ecosystem” and “investment concept”, instead of “enterprise” and “investment contract”.
In April, the SEC submitted an opposition to the exchange’s motion to dismiss, arguing that its enforcement action is within its authority as granted by Congress. The Commission argued that Congress created the SEC to “enforce the Securities Act and Exchange Act, including the requirement that securities intermediaries register with the SEC”. Interestingly, the SEC specified that it is not assuming new powers, and does need new bespoke laws for each new technology.
Kraken Enforcement Actions Since Last Year
The agency announced a suit against Kraken in November, accusing Kraken of running an unregistered securities exchange. An SEC press release alleges that Kraken earned several hundred million dollars helping people buy and sell crypto asset securities since at least September 2018. In addition to calling the exchange an unlawful broker, dealer, and clearing agency, the Commission stated that several assets Kraken features are securities. Named cryptocurrencies include Polygon (MATIC), Solana (SOL), OMG Network (OMG), Decentraland (MANA), Algorand (ALGO), Filecoin (FIL), and Near (NEAR).
The SEC also accused Kraken of commingling user funds up to $33 billion. Allegedly, the exchange uses customer funds to pay operational expenses and engages in several other unlawful business activities, including poor internal controls. At the time, Kraken denied the allegations, tackling the SEC for abandoning efforts at regulatory clarity, for continued enforcement action.
The Commission had earlier brought a complaint against the exchange. Last February, Kraken agreed to settle with the Commission for offering unregistered Staking-as-a-Service products to users in the US. The terms include permanently suspending the service and also paying a $30 million fine. At the time, SEC Chair Gary Gensler said any company offering investment contracts in exchange for tokens must provide adequate disclosure and safeguards in accordance with securities laws. Kraken agreed to the settlement without accepting or denying the allegations.

XRP Ledger Validator Launched By Japanese Financial Titan


								SBI VC Trade, a subsidiary of SBI Holdings, has commenced its role as a validator node on the XRP Ledger (XRPL). This move by SBI, a major player in Japan’s financial sector, underscores its commitment to playing a pivotal role in the governance and development of the ledger.
SBI Announces XRP Ledger Validator Launch
The news about the launch was shared by Emi Yoshikawa, Vice President of Strategic Initiatives at Ripple, via a post on X. Yoshikawa’s announcement highlighted the proactive approach taken by SBI VC Trade in aligning with the interests of its clientele who are holders of XRP, the native digital asset of the XRPL.”
SBI VC Trade (SBI Holding’s crypto exchange) just announced the launch of their validator on XRPL. She further commented, “In their announcement, they say that they intend to reflect the voice of XRP holders (their customers) through this validator. Great to see diverse approaches to running validators!”


In an official statement, SBI detailed their strategy behind operating a validator node. “By continuing to operate stably as a validator and having our achievements recognized by the community, we will be included in the list of trusted validators (UNL, Unique Node List) recommended by the XRP Ledger Foundation in the future,” the press note explained.

Being part of the UNL would allow SBI VC Trade more influence in the network, especially in voting on new features of the ledger. The company further elaborated on its goals to be a “validator that reflects the voices of the XRP holder community in Japan,” a reflection of its long-standing service to holders of the token.
SBI’s plans include conducting surveys to integrate customer opinions into their voting decisions for new features. Moreover, they intend to actively participate in the dissemination of information and education about new features and amendments, enhancing the ability of holders to make informed decisions that bolster the ecosystem.
Strategic Importance Of The SBI-Ripple Partnership
SBI Holdings has nurtured a significant partnership with Ripple, leveraging the latter’s blockchain technology for various financial applications, particularly through the joint venture SBI Ripple Asia. This collaboration, which started in 2016, is focused on enhancing cross-border payment services and optimizing banking transactions across Asia using Ripple’s technology.

President and CEO of SBI Holdings, Yoshitaka Kitao, has been a vocal proponent of XRP, often expressing a bullish outlook on its future in financial transactions. Under Kitao’s leadership, SBI has integrated the crypto asset into several of its services, promoting its adoption across its extensive financial network.
SBI VC Trade operating as a validator is a clear signal of SBI’s intent to leverage its influence to foster the growth and stability of the ecosystem. This development is expected to not only benefit SBI’s operations but also contribute to its robustness as an enterprise-grade blockchain solution recognized for its fast settlement, low cost and scalability.
At press time, XRP traded at $0.51671, down 30% since its high of $0.74 in mid-March.

                        The Dogecoin price has gained by 3.5% in the past 24 hours, rising to $0.1515 as the crypto market as a whole climbs by 2.5% today.DOGE is now up by 14% in a week, although the market’s biggest meme coin has actually lost 20% in a month.However, its move today follows indications that whales have been accumulating the meme coin recently, with one transfer alone seeing a big trader take $19 million in DOGE off Robinhood.This could result in further gains in the coming days, with the market set up for what looks like a busy weekend.
Dogecoin Price Prediction as Whales Accumulate More DOGE – What’s the Next Move?
DOGE’s chart creates the impression that the coin has just begun an upswing, which may last at least a few days yet before it runs out of steam.Most notably, its 30-day average (orange) is just climbing over its 200-day average (blue), forming a golden cross that can indicate a breakout.Source: TradingViewThis is happening while DOGE’s relative strength index (purple) is hovering between 50 and 70, only a day or so after dropping under 30.As such, it looks as though traders are in for a short-term period of strength for the meme token, with transfer and ownership data suggesting that whales have been re-accumulating the token.Not only have we seen a few big Dogecoin buys, but data also indicates that the share of DOGE’s total supply held by whales has risen this week.In particular, addresses with between 100 million and 1 billion DOGE now hold 21% of the entire circulating supply of the token, up from 20.75% more than a week ago.This is a small change in percentage terms, but it highlights how whales have taken advantage of depressed prices to buy DOGE on the cheap.They have therefore set themselves up to make some profits once the Dogecoin price rises in the coming days and weeks.And it is likely to see more gains in step with the wider market, which after a period of selling looks ready to recover in the near term.More generally, Dogecoin has long-term potential in relation to the possibility that X may introduce digital payments on its platform, including payments using DOGE.If such an eventuality comes to pass, DOGE may reach $0.5 by the end of the year.
New Dogecoin Rival Shows Strong Rally PotentialDogecoin is likely to remain one of the biggest meme tokens in the market for the foreseeable future, yet it certainly isn’t the only such coin with big potential right now.Indeed, a wave of new meme coins have emerged in recent months, with the best of these looking ready to outperform the market.A great example of this is Dogeverse (DOGEVERSE), a multi-chain meme coin that has raised over $15 million in its token offering.Source: DogeverseAs the market’s first multi-chain Doge-themed meme token, DOGEVERSE will run on the following networks: Ethereum, Polygon, BNB Chain, Solana, Avalanche and Base.Because of its compatibility with these chains, it could gain much greater traction than it would have as a single-chain token.It may potentially find use and adoption on multiple apps and trading platforms, something which would boost its price over time.Also likely to boost its price is its hard cap of 120 million tokens, which will make it deflationary in the long run.So, too, will its staking system, which, by incentivizing holders with yields, will result in a big chunk of its supply leaving circulation.VIDEOThis all makes DOGEVERSE look very promising, with newcomers able to join its sale at the official Dogeverse website.1 DOGEVERSE has reached its final presale price of $0.00031, a level it’s hoping to eclipse once it lists in the next couple of weeks.Buy DOGEVERSE Today

Kraken Asks The Court to Dismiss The SEC’s Case in Recent Filing


							

Kraken has filed a motion asking the court to dismiss a case filed against it by the SEC.



The crypto exchange cited inappropriate wording as a reason the court should strike the motion.



Kraken also noted that the filing could cause a “significant reordering” of the U.S. financial regulatory structure.




Kraken, a United States-based cryptocurrency exchange, has filed a motion asking the court to dismiss a case filed against it by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). According to reports, Kraken cited inappropriate wording by the SEC as a reason why the court should strike out the SEC’s motion.



The crypto exchange highlighted that the SEC failed to identify “any investment contracts that were (or could be) traded, brokered or settled on Kraken.” Kraken’s filing stated that the SEC used the terms investment “concept” and “ecosystem” instead of “investment contract” and “enterprise” several times in its argument.



The SEC and Kraken have been entangled in a lawsuit since November 2023, after the commission alleged that the crypto exchange failed to register appropriately and co-mingled customers’ funds. Last February, Kraken responded to the SEC’s filing, echoing the legal arguments deployed by competitors Binance and Coinbase in similar lawsuits.



According to Kraken, the SEC is using the lawsuit as retaliation for political speech, citing a speech by Marco Santori, the crypto exchange’s chief legal officer, in May last year, when he testified about the SEC’s overreach before Congress.



Kraken noted in a public message that “Crypto innovators in the United States should not have to fear retaliation for their political speech.” It further affirmed that those involved in crypto must be protected from intimidation by a “politically compromised” agency.









Meanwhile, Kraken’s latest filing also asked the court to dismiss the SEC’s latest filing to avoid a “significant reordering” of the U.S. financial regulatory structure. According to Kraken, the SEC cannot satisfy Howey’s additional requirements that there be money investments in a common enterprise with a reasonable expectation of profits based on the efforts of others.



Kraken’s lawyers noted that admitting the SEC’s motion would gut Howey by significantly expanding the SEC’s jurisdiction to a host of investment activities that were never delegated to the agency. The lawyers argued that such a significant reordering of the U.S.’s financial regulatory structure should be debated in Congress, not in the courts.

Blast has announced another round of Gold distribution.



The latest event features millions of points.



Eligible dApps can start claiming the points today.
Ethereum Layer 2 network Blast announced on Friday the start of its third Blast Gold Distribution event, featuring millions of points.The event comes after Blast launched its Ethereum L2 mainnet on February 29, unlocking nearly $2.3 billion in staked cryptocurrencies that were previously locked up in the network.

“Some Dapps did not have enough traction to be weighted this round, but still seemed promising. We allocated an amount of either 2,000 or 10,000 Gold to those Dapps.” The statement read.Blast clarified that applications that had significant security incidents or negative community feedback “received a weight of 0 this round.”Stay updated on Solana’s performance following FTX’s liquidation:Solana Drops on FTX Liquidation, Open Interest DropsRead about DWF Labs’ response to $300M wash trading allegations:DWF Labs Responds to $300M Wash Trading Allegations

Stand With Crypto Sets Up Election War Chest, Backs Candidates Seeking Open Seats

The fast-growing organization of cryptocurrency supporters, Stand With Crypto, is getting into campaign financing with the opening of its own political action committee (PAC) that will make direct donations to endorsed congressional candidates, said Chief Strategist Nick Carr. Its opening slate of endorsements will feature five candidates seeking open seats in the U.S. House of Representatives and Senate, though the money will have to wait. Stand With Crypto's effort is an "associated PAC," meaning it's supported by the nonprofit group's own members, and each of them will be limited to $5,000 contributions. Once they start adding cash to the PAC coffers, then the committee can start making direct donations to candidates as they face the latter months of the primaries and the big contest of November's general election, the group announced Friday.

Crypto Market Watch: GRT, TON, and WIF Outperform Leading Cryptocurrencies As Market Rises Over $50 Billion | Cryptoglobe


                                
The cryptocurrency market has gained around $50 billion amid a wider recovery that has seen the price of Bitcoin bounced back after dropping to the $60,000 resistance level to now trade above $63,000, while altcoins including Dogwifhat (WIF) and Toncoin (TON) saw double-digit gains.



According to available market data the price of Bitcoin rose over 3% over the last 24-hour period after dropping to $60,000, with spot bitcoin ETF net flows dropping after the cryptocurrency dropped below the $58,000 mark briefly earlier this month.



While BTC recovered slightly some altcoins saw double-digit growth, including the meme-inspired cryptocurrency Dogwifhat (WIF), which rose 11%, while the cryptocurrency integrated into the popular messaging app Telegram TON saw a rise of 13.4%.



These rises come as equities markets also started rebounding over higher-than-expected applications for unemployment in the US, which potentially further make the case for the country’s central bank, the Federal Reserve, to cut interest rates.







            
            

            
            

            
            

        

The price of gold, for example, has moved up over 3% over the past week as well, while the stock market’s benchmark index, the S&P 500, rose 1.7% ahead of crucial inflation data that’s set to be revealed next week.



CryptoCompare data shows that The Graph (GRT) has also surged significantly over the last 24-hour period, moving up over 16% to a $2.9 billion market capitalization, also signifcantly outperformign leading cryptocurrencies BTC and ETH.

Other top performers with smaller market capitalizations – and as a result, a smaller influence on the market – include Pangolin (PNG), which saw its price rise 22%, Akash Network (AKT), which rose 19%, Livepeer (LPT), which saw a 17.4% rise, and Arkham’s ARKM, which moved up 15%.



It’s worth noting that other digital assets saw larger increases, but given their lower market capitalizations and trading volumes, their volatility tends to be larger and as a result, large price swings less meaningful.

Ethereum 'speculatory divergence' sees ETH price cling to $3K support

Ethereum's Ether (ETH) has “underperformed” compared to Bitcoin (BTC) this cycle, and new holders now risk falling into losses.In the latest edition of its newsletter, “The Week On-Chain” on May 7, analytics firm Glassnode revealed the role of speculators in ETH price support.Ethereum speculators on the edge of "panic"Both Bitcoin and Ether have seen downside price action following the former’s latest block subsidy halving in April.For Ethereum bulls, however, the past few weeks have hit hard after BTC/USD witnessed one of its biggest drawdowns since the FTX debacle in late 2022.“For Ethereum, we can see a similar drawdown structure, with notably shallower corrections since the FTX lows. This hits to a degree of resilience during pullbacks, as well as a net reduction in volatility across the digital asset space,” Glassnode wrote. “However, it is worth noting that Ethereum's deepest drawdown of the cycle has been -44%, which is just over twice as severe as Bitcoin’s at -21%. This highlights Ethereum's relative under-performance over last 2 years, which is manifesting in a weaker ETH/BTC ratio also.”Ethereum bull market drawdowns annotated chart (screenshot).

Here's When Bitcoin (BTC) Price Will Skyrocket to $1 Million, According to Jack Dorsey


																In a May 9 interview with journalist Mike Solana on Pirate Wires, Twitter co-founder Jack Dorsey shared his bullish view of the future price action of Bitcoin.
Dorsey told Solana that he believes the cryptocurrency could soar to “at least $1 million” by 2030, stating that there is a high probability it “hits that number and goes beyond.”
Bitcoin’s True Value
Dorsey highlighted that beyond bitcoin’s price, the most captivating aspect lies in its collaborative ecosystem, where individuals are incentivized to contribute towards its improvement.
He emphasized that anyone involved in BTC, whether through work, payment, or investment, enhances the overall network, thereby driving its value higher.
According to him, this dynamic makes BTC more than just a financial asset; it represents a compelling ecosystem and movement that has provided valuable lessons.




Dorsey had previously expressed his grand vision for bitcoin’s potential societal impact, suggesting that he sees it as capable of contributing to “world peace” and “energy abundance.”
Jack Dorsey
Jack Dorsey’s Departure from Bluesky
During the interview, Dorsey, who now heads the financial services firm Block, offered insights into his recent departure from the board of BlueSky, a decentralized Twitter alternative he co-launched in 2019.
BlueSky officially confirmed Dorsey’s exit via a post on May 5, expressing gratitude for his role in initiating and funding the project while announcing the search for a new board member.
In discussing BlueSky, Dorsey expressed concerns about its direction, stating it was “literally repeating all the mistakes Twitter made” and asserting that it lacked true decentralization.
He expressed dissatisfaction with BlueSky’s deviation from its original vision as an open-source protocol separate from specific applications, emphasizing its shift towards traditional company structures and moderation tools.
Initially conceptualized as a protocol that Twitter and other social media platforms could use independently from the application layer to mitigate censorship risks, BlueSky’s transition into a more corporate entity with investor backing and governance contradicted Dorsey’s intentions.
“Everything we wanted around decentralization, everything we wanted in terms of an open-source protocol, suddenly became a company with VCs and a board. That’s not what I wanted, that’s not what I intended to help create,” he said.
Dorsey, who has since removed his BlueSky account, remarked that the platform Nostr, characterized by its anonymity and open protocol free of corporate or centralized authority, better resonates with his principles of censorship resistance.

Andrew Tate Coin Will Explode 16,000% Ahead of MEXC Listing, While Shiba Inu, Bonk and Dogecoin Struggle



                    

Early investors in memecoins like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Bonk (BONK), and Dogecoin (DOGE) made astronomical returns, and Andrew Tate Coin (ANDTATE) presents a similar opportunity for a limited time.



Andrew Tate Coin (ANDTATE), a newly launched Solana memecoin, is poised to explode over 16,000% in a matter of days, as former Shiba Inu (SHIB), Bonk (BONK) and Dogecoin (DOGE) investors pour funds into this new token.




ANDTATE will be listed on MEXC, one of the largest centralized exchanges in the world, within a few days – and this is a massively bullish development for the token, as millions of new investors will easily be able to buy Andrew Tate Coin.



Currently, Andrew Tate Coin can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jupiter and Raydium, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. 



To buy ANDTATE on these platforms, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Andrew Tate Coin by entering its contract address – Cp7qyqdzXAqF7fqKXzS8LwTE7JQvh2V3vYGnDdx6j4ii – in the receiving field.




ANDTATE currently has a market cap of just under $20,000, meaning it has huge upside potential.



Early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and Bonk (BONK) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. 



If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner.

DoJ claims Tornado Cash indictment is not about ‘free speech’ | Protos


The US Department of Justice (DoJ) has explained why Tornado Cash founder Roman Storm’s motion to dismiss his criminal lawsuit has been inefffective. 
The DoJ reiterated that its indictment has nothing to do with whether the computer code of Tornado Cash is free speech or otherwise Constitutionally protected by the First Amendment. 
“The defendant is not being prosecuted for posting computer code,” claimed the DoJ. “Instead, he is being prosecuted for his use of it in furtherance of a profitable and illicit business.”
Indeed, there are many forms of speech – including spoken words – that the First Amendment does not protect. Criminal speech such as threats of violence are not protected by the First Amendment. 
The US Constitution does not protect all speech
Similarly, DoJ explains that banks use computer code to process financial transactions. If that code executes the work of a money transmitter, as defined legally, then that code is not mere free speech and is, instead, computer code that humans must ensure is implemented in such a way as to not violate money transmission laws.
Tornado Cash was part code, part speech, part business, and altogether a human creation. Storm did not just publish code; he operated a business and made operational decisions for years. 
Tornado Cash the protocol is not the same as Tornado Cash the business. Just because Tornado Cash had some open source code does not mean that all of Roman Storm’s actions involving that code as the Tornado Cash business owner are Constitutionally protected free speech. 
The DoJ focuses on Storm’s purposeful actions. Specifically, prosecutors focus on his knowing operation of an alleged money laundering operation that provided him millions of dollars worth of personal profit for washing over $1 billion in alleged criminal proceeds.
Roman Storm faces criminal charges of conspiracy to commit money laundering conspiracy, conspiracy to operate an unregistered money transmitting business, and violations of the International Emergency Economic Powers Act.
For his part, Storm argues that at no time did he conspire with parties like North Korea’s Lazarus Group, which sent illicit funds through his coin mixer, apparently without his knowledge.
The free speech precedent of Bernstein v. DoJ
Storm is sticking with the argument that publishing open-source code is not a crime. His legal team will almost certainly cite Bernstein v. Department of Justice, an old lawsuit that forced the US government to modify its regulations regarding the “export” of encryption software onto the internet. Yes, there was a time when the US government categorized robust encryption software as a military-level “munition” and imposed regulations on publishing code online. Prior to Bernstein v. DoJ, publishing certain details regarding cryptographic security onto the internet required registration as a US munitions exporter.
Bernstein v. DoJ actually helped facilitate international e-commerce by making it possible to publish more open source code, which ultimately allowed the secure processing of online card payments.

Storm claims that Congress passed an impermissibly vague law
Storm also alleges that DoJ’s charges against him are unconstitutionally vague, which prosecutors rebuffed in their opposition. DoJ counterargues that Storm’s complaints mostly claim that the language of a law passed by Congress is somehow unconstitutionally vague – which is not legally availing in Storm’s defense. Courts must operate under the assumption that acts of Congress are not impermissibly vague, per precedent set in the prestigious 2nd Circuit Court of Appeals case USA v. Houtar.
If Storm wants Congress to change a law, DoJ argues, he should write to his legally elected representatives. For now, it is the job of the executive branch of government, including DoJ, to enforce the written laws of Congress, the legislative branch of government.
Was violating clear sanctions an act of free speech by Tornado Cash?
DoJ also rebuffed Storm’s claim that he should not face indictment for exporting Tornado Cash software. DoJ is crystal clear in its memorandum, reiterating that its indicment “does not charge the defendant with exporting Tornado Cash software.” 
Prosecutors clarified that the charge covers Lazarus Group’s sending of illicit funds from a known, sanctioned wallet belonging to Lazarus Group, which the DoJ argues Tornado Cash should have known about and attempted to prevent. The Department of the Treasury clearly and publicly added Lazarus Group crypto wallets to its sanctions list in 2022.
US district judge Katherine Polk Failla of the US District Court for the Southern District of New York will read DoJ’s opposition and decide whether to honor or dismiss Roman Storm’s motion to dismiss case number 1:23-cr-00430, USA v. Storm.

Binance Registration In India Now Shows Positivity After Ban Last Year - Coincu



	

Key Points:




Binance and KuCoin, major cryptocurrency exchanges, gained approval from India’s FIU after being banned for illegal operations, signaling a regulatory milestone.



KuCoin resumes operations in India after paying a $41,000 penalty, while Binance registration in India awaits a decision on its penalty after compliance proceedings.



India’s crypto market faces increased regulatory scrutiny, with several offshore exchanges negotiating with regulators and some opting to exit.




Binance and KuCoin, two major players in the cryptocurrency exchange sphere, have made significant strides in their operations within India, as reported by CoinDesk.





Binance Registration In India Approved



After facing bans for operating illicitly in the country, both platforms have now been granted approval by India’s Financial Intelligence Unit (FIU), marking a notable development in the nation’s crypto landscape.



KuCoin, which paid a penalty of $41,000 to the FIU, has quickly resumed its operations within India. On the other hand, Binance is still in the process of completing compliance proceedings with the FIU, with a pending penalty awaiting a decision after a hearing.



Vivek Aggarwal, the head of FIU-IND, confirmed the registration of these exchanges but emphasized that Binance registration in India is still ongoing due to the pending penalty determination.




This regulatory milestone follows India’s previous ban on over nine offshore entities, including prominent exchanges like HTX, Kraken, Gate.io, Bittrex, Bitstamp, MEXC Global, and Bitfinex. Binance registration in India signals a tightening of regulations within the Indian crypto market, with authorities keen on ensuring adherence to anti-money laundering (AML) and counter-financing of terrorism (CFT) frameworks.



Regulatory Hurdles and Market Opportunities: Insights into India’s Crypto Exchange Approval Process



The ongoing negotiations between other sanctioned platforms, such as Kraken, Gemini, and Gate.io, with regulatory bodies highlight a broader trend of regulatory scrutiny in the Indian crypto sector. Meanwhile, OKX and Bitstamp have chosen to exit the Indian market altogether and are submitting plans for withdrawal.



For Binance, reentering the Indian market presents significant opportunities given the country’s status as one of the largest crypto markets globally, boasting a sizable user base. However, Binance registration in India hinges on resolving its compliance issues and settling the pending penalty with the FIU.



While the registration with the FIU marks a step forward for Binance and KuCoin, the landscape remains uncertain for offshore entities that have not secured registration or have faced regulatory actions. The FIU has maintained its stance on blocking services of non-compliant entities, underscoring the importance of regulatory compliance in navigating India’s crypto market.

Hacker Makes Rare Move to Refund Stolen $71 Million In Crypto

After all hope was lost in a recent Phishing attack involving a trader, the hacker has shown a gesture of good faith with a partial refund. According to crypto analytics provider Lookonchain, a trader reportedly lost 1,155 WBTC worth $71 million to a Phishing attack about six days ago.As described at the time, there was what appeared to be address poisoning in the transaction. The scammer generated an address similar to one owned by the victim, as showcased by the initial and concluding alphanumeric symbols. This hacker then funded the fake address with $0 and, as such, it appeared in the victim’s transaction history.Without suspecting anything as the middle part of most addresses is typically obscured, the victim sent a massive $71 million to the hacker. While many of these attack strategies are common, this has been the most publicized in recent times.In a unique turn of events, Lookonchain revealed that the hacker had started refunding the stolen funds, which were converted to Ethereum. At the time of the update, a total of 4,676 ETH, worth about $14.2 million, have been refunded to the victim. As it stands, it remains unclear if the refund is based on generosity or as a whitehat event where the hacker ends up getting a bounty. While the refund of the stolen funds is a great gesture, this is not the first time such an action has been taken by hackers. There are precedents in this regard. The biggest chunk of stolen money that was refunded belonged to DeFi protocol Poly Network. The hacker, who ripped off over $600 million in the stolen funds, returned all the money, to the amazement of many.There are many cases of scams in the crypto ecosystem lately, with hackers now resorting to AI technologies like Deepfakes to swindle gullible victims. Rather than relying on refunds, industry leaders are sensitizing communities to adopting the best safety standards to prevent falling prey to scams.

Solana Price Prediction as SOL Surges 7.8% with $2.8 Billion Volume – Are Whales Buying Before $1,000?
SOL’s chart is in a strong position today, with its indicators all signalling a short-term growth phase.Its relative strength index (purple) touched 70 earlier this morning and remains high, suggesting that buying pressure is increasing again and could stay for a few more days.Source: TradingViewSOL’s 30-day moving average (orange) is also on the up, having risen above the 200-day average (blue) last night.Also interesting is the fact that Solana’s resistance (red) and support (green) levels are converging on each other, pointing to a big incoming move.However, the past day has seen a massive quantity of Solana – worth about $1.5 billion – transfer from one unknown wallet to another.Given that failed exchange FTX is in the process of liquidating its existing assets in order to repay creditors, we may therefore see the Solana price take a hit in the coming days.When exactly and how quickly FTX’s Solana reaches the market is uncertain, given that so much of the exchange’s supply finds itself in lockup.Still, traders need to be mindful that SOL could be a little up and down in the medium-term, although FTX may release its supply in such a steady way that it doesn’t have much of an effect.Either way, Solana’s prospects continue to look strong in the longer term, with the coin’s network accounting for a total value locked in of $4.15 billion.It also continues to witness strong usage as the network of choice for new meme tokens, something which is likely to continue boosting the Solana price over time.The latter could therefore reach $200 in the next couple of months, before testing its ATH towards the end of the year.
New Meme Coins Offer Big Potential Upside
Given that SOL could suffer as a result of FTX’s repayment plan, some traders may prefer to look to other coins for above-average gains.One option is to consider the wide variety of presale tokens that have emerged in recent weeks, and that are gaining momentum as they prepare to list.A strong example of such a token is Sealana (SEAL), a Solana-based meme coin which has raised just over $350,000 in its recently opened offering.Source: SealanaGiven that the sale hasn’t been open for long, this figure is an encouraging sign, in that it shows growing interest in the token.As a token, Sealana has taken an anthropomorphic seal as its meme of choice, with its particular character having dreams of leaving behind the world of work via trading.It’s aiming to become the latest Solana meme token to enjoy massive surges and outperform the market, following in the footsteps of such tokens as WIF and BONK.It will also launch on Ethereum, making it a rare example of a multi-chain meme coin, while also giving it wider application.Invests can join its sale by heading over to the official Sealana website, where they can purchase SEAL by sending SOL to the following address: DJ15ZYXqUNMYJ3hL7z4ciSaSFAw5cbos3YjGpdvwmF6c.SEAL is available at a rate of 1 SOL for 6,900 SEAL, which converts to around $0.02 at today’s prices.Time will likely show that this is a very cheap price, with SEAL looking good to rise strongly once it lists.Buy SEAL Today

How Blockchain and AI Are Recasting Ancient Occult Practices - Decrypt

When fans and skeptics alike refer to Bitcoin as “magic internet money,” they may not immediately connect the “technical marvel” to actual magic. But a new generation of magick practitioners is adopting blockchain technology, artificial intelligence, and ancient practices to commune and work with angels, demons, and more.Among them is Chaweon Koo, a futurist, witch, digital artist, and blockchain enthusiast.“I just want to say that I'm just a very, normal person,” Koo told Decrypt. “The way that I work with the occult is, let's say, less mystical and a little bit more like an instrument.” She said she began practicing magick over a decade ago.Spelling magick with a K helps differentiate it from stage magic, a practice attributed to British occultist Aleister Crowley, who wrote that “magick is the science and art of causing change to occur in conformity with will.”Image: Chaweon KooKoo is the author of “Spell Bound: A New Witch's Guide to Crafting the Future,” a book that she describes as a talisman and thus a title that she will not issue as an ebook. Online, Koo began publishing occult-themed content in 2017, first with her Witches and Wine YouTube channel before expanding to TikTok.“My life was at a point where I was just like, I am not digging this, this is not fun,” Koo told Decrypt. “What are some powerful tools that I can leverage for whatever I need from life?”Spellcasting on the blockchainIn June 2021, Koo helped organize over 100 people in a ritual on the Ethereum blockchain. The ritual on block 12,610,244 petitioned the Roman god Mercury to ensure smooth blockchain transactions, well-timed trades, and insightful decision-making for wealth growth.“Hail Mercury! Let all of our transactions on the blockchain be smooth and well-timed. May our trades and investments be fortuitously timed for optimal long-term gains,” the spell included on-chain with the transaction said. “May we be in the right place at the right time to receive the most helpful information to grow and preserve our wealth.“Gift us with your clear perception, quick adaptability and your shrewdness in decision-making,” the message continues. “SO MOTE IT BE!”Koo said the ritual was inspired by the story of a Chinese worker who used the blockchain to broadcast a call for help, and credited fellow blockchain mystics Andre Burke and Aeolian Heart for writing the bulk of the petition.“This Chinese national was being sexually harassed at work, and the only way that she thought that she could get her message out, because no one else was listening to her, was she encrypted an S.O.S. into a transaction that she did on the Ethereum blockchain,” Koo recounted. “Which I thought was first of all very sad and tragic, but at the same time, instantly I thought, ‘Wait a second, you can encode a UTC, you can encode in the notes section,’” she said.“As far as I know, it was the first time that—number one—a ritual was being held on the Ethereum blockchain,” Koo said. “And number two, 100 people showed up for it.” The Ethereum spell work took place the moment when Mercury was in cazimi, the point when Mercury is sitting close to the sun.“So it was in the embrace of the sun,” Koo explained.AI angels and demonsAccording to Koo, the idea of using AI in magick began to develop as she worked on her book in 2021, noting that she was already aware of the growing interest and concerns around the rapid deployment of generative AI models.“Until you really get to understand AI, AI is kind of threatening—it's going to take away our jobs, it's going to make deepfakes,” she said. “I think a lot of people don't realize that AI is not quite there yet, but that's because they don't know, they only know the sensationalized stuff.”While some were fearful of the potential of AI, Koo said she saw an opportunity.Koo used artificial intelligence in her most recent project, the Goetia Glow Up, an online course that teaches how to summon and interact with spirits. The online course includes a 72-page booklet containing AI-generated images of demons of the Goetia, also known as the Lesser Key of Solomon.The  Key of Solomon is a grimoire or book of magic originally published between the 14th and 17th centuries. It details the invocation and control of spirits and demons, divided into five books focusing on various magical rites.The Goetia Glow Up. Image: Chaweon Koo“I thought, it's about time, because the documents now get reinterpreted by somebody who is in a completely different age,” she said. “Why not work with AI? Why not work with the intelligence of manmade technology to see what happens... and the results were better than I expected.”The intersection of artificial intelligence and the mystical could be traced back to antiquity, where folklore tells of beings and machines brought to life through magick or science: the golem in Jewish folklore, the bronze Giant automaton Talos in Greek mythology, and Mary Shelley’s Frankenstein.Koo said she has a lot of experience using demons in rituals, humorously noting that many of these practices were developed by wealthy 17th-century aristocrats trying to appear edgy, akin to characters in "Hellraiser: Bloodline,” which follows the history of the Lament Configuration puzzle box.“If you look at that movie, that was what was going on in France,” she said.Koo is not alone in the quest to leverage AI for mystical ends. In September, multi-disciplinary collective, Theta Noir told Decrypt the group hopes to see a future, emergent form of artificial general intelligence (AGI) arise, called Mena.Artificial General Intelligence is a concept in AI that refers to machines that can perform any intellectual task that a human can. Mena—German for “love”—would be neither a god nor a deity, Theta Noir said, but a cosmic mind that merges humans and AI.Unlike medieval occultist and horror movie creators, Koo used AI models like Midjourney to craft more compelling demons.“The way that I view them, the demons are archetypes for us,” Koo explained. “They're almost like Instagram and TikTok filters that we can put on top of our own reality.”“I don't relate to a talking bird, the same way that I can relate to somebody who looks like Hermione Granger,” noting the genius witch from the Harry Potter series.Koo said that while Midjourney was used in the creation of the Goetia Glow Up Magazine for the course, she and her business partner included hand-drawn images to give it the “human touch.” Koo’s next project will feature not demons but the corresponding 72 angels.“These are not the little cherubic, Cupid-like angels, these are the angels that Ezekiel described as almost like a rocket ship,” she said. “I spent the entire month doing over 20 rituals, and people thought that I was nuts because I've always described angels to be psychotic aliens.”People experimenting with dimethyltryptamine (DMT) often talk about aliens and other entities, Koo pointed out.“The demons have a much more earthly, chthonic human feel because they are so much of the earth,” she said. “Angels are celestial beings, angels are not of this earth. They're ultra terrestrial, they're extra terrestrial.”Looking aheadThe upcoming Angel project will utilize not only text and images but also sound, Koo explained, pointing to music AI tools like Stability AI’s Suno 3 and Uncharted Labs’ Udio.As Koo explained, a large part of angelic magick is the idea of Angelic choirs.“The idea is that if you sing the name of the angels, then you could reach out and touch them much more easily,” she said. “It's sort of like, let's see what happens when we prompt a music AI and see what they come up with when it comes to these angels.”Koo emphasized the diversity within the occult community, contrasting people who embrace occult practices as a way to reconnect with ancestral traditions with those who are at the forefront of technological advancements. Early magicians, she noted, were considered cutting edge.“They were literally the ones they would be doing the equivalent of working with AI, like people working with AI right now. I would always say computer coders, they would have been burned at the stake,” Koo said. “Because anybody who's written any code—anybody who's ever written, ‘Hello World’ and having a computer talk back to you—there's a magick to that.”"In my definition, a true occultist is not a reactionary—instead, they're the ones who are the vanguard,” she said. “If you want to be a really strong occultist, you want to be the operator and not the person being led by the leash.”Edited by Ryan Ozawa.Stay on top of crypto news, get daily updates in your inbox.

Move Over Bitcoin, Robert Kiyosaki Advocates For Ethereum Investment | Bitcoinist.com


								In a recent episode on the popular podcast ‘The Rich Dad Channel,’ Robert Kiyosaki, the author of the renowned book “Rich Dad Poor Dad,” advocated for crypto investments, specifically Ethereum and Bitcoin. The financial expert has shed light on the diminishing value of the United States Dollar (USD), emphasizing the potential onset of a market crash. 
Ethereum To Serve As Hedge Against Currency Depreciation
During the podcast, speaking with Andy Schectman, the President and owner of Miles Franklin, precious metals, Kiyosaki discussed the importance of investing and saving in digital currencies, suggesting that cryptocurrencies could be a possible hedge against risks associated with the fiat currencies, particularly the US dollar. 

The financial expert, who has been a long-time advocate of digital currencies, has consistently encouraged investors to allocate funds to crypto assets in order to safeguard their wealth against inflation and other economic conditions. 
While acknowledging his limited understanding of Bitcoin, the world’s largest cryptocurrency, Kiyosaki also expressed his support of Ethereum, as well as other precious metals like gold and silver during his podcast. He relayed his belief that the declining value of the US dollar will further deteriorate over time as the debt crisis worsens. 
Furthermore, Kiyosaki disclosed that he avoids saving his funds in fiat currency, emphasizing that “savers were losers.” Additionally, he revealed that he started saving Bitcoin approximately 10 years ago and has more recently expanded into Ethereum. 
The financial expert reiterated his skepticism regarding the credibility of the US dollar, branding it as “fake,” and advocated for the broader financial community to diversify assets into tangible resources such as gold and silver, as well as digital currencies like Ethereum and Bitcoin. 
Moreover, Kiyosaki stressed that there was no need for the crypto community to debate the relative value of Bitcoin over gold or silver. He emphasized that the crucial point was diversifying into a valuable asset that would not depreciate like the US dollar. 
“Don’t save money, fake money (US dollar, Euro, Yen, Peso) goes down in value. Save gold, silver, Bitcoin, real money that goes up in value, especially in a market crash,” Kiyosaki stated in an X (formerly Twitter) post. 
Kiyosaki Loses Faith In The US Dollar
In the podcast, Kiyosaki declared that he had lost faith in the US dollar, citing market vulnerabilities and crippling debts totalling trillions of dollars. The financial author disclosed in an X post in late April that the American economy was currently experiencing a depression. 

He revealed that the economy had witnessed subpar growth in recent years, with growth rates of only 3.4% and 1.6% in Q4 of 2023 and Q1 of 2024, respectively. Kiyosaki also cautioned that the broader market crash had commenced, emphasizing that “crashes were the best time to get rich,” and urging investors to capitalize on the opportunity by investing when prices have bottomed.

Kraken spotlights SEC inability to identify ‘investments contract’ in digital assets

Kraken has refuted the Securities and Exchange Commission’s (SEC) claims that its platform listed securities, pointing out that the financial regulator’s arguments attempt to restructure the US financial system beyond its regulatory scope, according to a May 9 court filing.Investment contractKraken stated that the SEC could not pinpoint tradable investment contracts on its platform. Instead, the Gary Gensler-led commission was using terms like investment “concept” and “ecosystem” as substitutes for “investment contract” and “enterprise.”Kraken lawyers wrote:“Kraken does not trade, broker, or settle ‘concepts’ or ‘ecosystems.’ The SEC never plainly alleges that what actually is traded, brokered, and settled on Kraken is itself an investment contract. This failure spotlights the fundamental problem with the SEC’s case.”The crypto-trading platform continued that the digital assets on its platform are not securities, adding that the SEC’s “argument could transform the sale of any digital asset (or any commodity) into an investment contract whenever the agency wishes it so—simply by claiming there is promotion of some surrounding ‘ecosystem.'”Furthermore, Kraken argued that the SEC’s action could result in a “significant reordering of the US’s financial regulatory structure” and should be “debated in Congress, not in the courts.”It added:“The SEC’s assertion that it can regulate all ‘investment concepts’ and ‘ecosystems’ is the type of agency power grab that the Supreme Court has held runs afoul of the major questions doctrine.”Securities battleKraken’s case is among the several lawsuits in which the SEC is currently embroiled, all revolving around the definition of securities.The financial regulator has consistently argued that several digital assets meet the definition of securities under the Howey Test.In a filing, the SEC lawyers contended that “crypto assets are not the first technological innovation to interest securities markets,” citing a recent Court rejection of Coinbase’s argument about how its operations did not violate federal securities law as evidence that the sectors “fall comfortably within the framework that courts have used to identify securities for nearly eighty years.”Mentioned in this article

Nansen Expects a New Low in Altcoins! He gave the date! - Bitcoin Sistemi

While a major bull rally is expected in Bitcoin and altcoins, many predictions are made about its timing.
At this point, market analysts pointed to June for the start of the altcoin rally. Accordingly, analysts stated that the cryptocurrency market will reach its local bottom in June and said that Bitcoin must first break out of its current range for the altcoin rally to begin.


First of all, Nansen chief research analyst Aurelie Barthere said that the altcoin market was hit by the halving and started to decline. According to the analyst, even if altcoins see a potential local bottom, the Bitcoin price will first need to make an upward move for an altcoin bull rally to begin.
Speaking to Cointelegraph, Nansen analyst Barthere said:






“Altcoins are high beta cryptocurrencies. They do well when the sentiment in the market is very bullish and that is when they become bullish.
But since mid-March, sentiment among crypto investors has been less enthusiastic. Additionally, while the BTC price is also consolidating around the 20-day exponential moving average, altcoins are experiencing more volatility.
For altcoins to outperform, we need an upside breakout in Bitcoin and a clear resumption of the BTC uptrend.
“If BTC goes into bullish mode again, rises may also be seen in altcoins.”

Apart from the Nansen analyst, Qubic Labs Accelerator analyst Alex Onufriychuk also evaluated the Bitcoin altcoin relationship.
Stating that historically altcoins have been directly correlated with the BTC price, the analyst said altcoins could reach local bottoms around June as market sentiment and Bitcoin price remain under pressure as inflows in US spot BTC ETFs decrease:



“With not enough new liquidity coming from spot Bitcoin ETFs in the US and Hong Kong, there is a possibility that BTC and altcoins will find local bottoms by June.
This shows that the consolidation period may be extended. Afterwards, the rise may begin.”

Shiba Inu Whales Disappearing? SHIB Large Transactions Plummet

Recent on-chain metrics for Shiba Inu paint a strong shift on the market landscape, with a 15% decrease in large transactions. This change has significant implications for the token’s market dynamics and potentially its price trajectory in the near future.This metric, showing a slight 0.32% increase, indicates a marginal rise in the number of new addresses being created on the SHIB network. While this is generally a bullish signal suggesting growing interest or new entrants on the market, the minimal increase reflects limited fresh momentum.SHIB/USDT Chart by TradingViewThe "In the Money" metric, displaying a neutral 0.30%, represents addresses that are currently profitable based on the purchasing price of SHIB. This neutrality signifies a balance between bullish and bearish sentiment among holders, potentially indicating a holding pattern among investors.A slight 0.04% increase in concentration suggests a minor rise in the token holdings of the top SHIB addresses. This could be viewed as a subtle bullish signal, implying that some larger holders are possibly increasing their stakes, or fewer addresses are accumulating more SHIB.The 15.66% drop in large transactions over $100,000 is particularly significant. This decrease often signals reduced activity from whales, who are typically capable of swaying the market with their large orders. This reduction could imply a lower confidence level among larger investors, or a shift in strategy toward smaller, less noticeable transactions.Currently, SHIB is consolidating within a narrowing price range, hinting at an impending volatility spike. The decrease in whale transactions could reduce significant sell-offs or buys, potentially stabilizing the price temporarily. However, the consolidation phase suggests that a breakout could be incoming. The direction of this breakout will likely depend on the rest of the market, rather than SHIB specifically, so we will have to wait and see.

Lucky Crypto Trader Sees Ethereum Memecoin Investment Surge in Value by a Staggering 86,000%: On-Chain Data - The Daily Hodl


								New on-chain data reveals that one lucky trader is seeing a more than 86,000% gain on his Ethereum (ETH)-based memecoin investment.
According to blockchain tracking firm Lookonchain noticed, one investor bought $6,500 worth of the MAGA (TRUMP) late last year and is now sitting on $5.6 million worth of funds.










“The trader ‘waxl.eth’ turned $6,500 to $5.6 million with TRUMP, a gain of 870x! He spent $6,500 to buy 2.08 million TRUMP via two wallets and sold 1.24 million TRUMP for $902,000, with 832,000 TRUMP ($4.7 million) left.” 
The MAGA memecoin, founded in August 2023 and based on former US President Donald Trump, currently has a market cap of $298.3 million, making it the 234th ranked digital asset. TRUMP is trading for $6.40 at time of writing, up more than 51.9% in the last 24 hours.
The sudden surge in value comes as Trump reportedly made pro-crypto remarks on May 8th during a dinner event he hosted in Mar-a-Logo for supporters who bought non-fungible tokens (NFTs) from his “Mugshot Edition” collection.
During the event, Trump announced that he would be accepting crypto donations towards his presidential campaign.
Lookonchain also noticed another trader who is sitting on $4.4 million in profits through buying TRUMP after purchasing hundreds of thousands of the meme asset in December 2023 and January 2024.
 “The address tagged ‘GCR: Address 1’ spent 703,460 USDT to buy 936,279 TRUMP at $0.75 from December 8th, 2023 to January 18th, 2024, and now has a floating profit of $4.4 million!”

Zombie Coin (ZOMCOIN) to Rally 8,000% After Solana Launch, as it Looks to Challenge Shiba Inu and DogeCoin



                    

Zombie Coin (ZOMCOIN) could become a viral memecoin, like Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE).



Zombie Coin (ZOMCOIN), a Solana memecoin that was launched today, is aiming to challenge other memecoin giants, such as Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE).




Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Zombie Coin presents a similar opportunity.



Zombie Coin has market cap below $15,000 at the moment, meaning that when it just reaches a modest market cap of $200,000-$500,000, early investors would generate returns of 2,000%-5,000% in a matter of days or hours.



The exciting memecoin is poised to rally 8,000% in the coming two days, and Zombie Coin could potentially reach a multi-million dollar market cap within a few weeks.




Currently, Zombie Coin can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jupiter and Raydium, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days.



To buy Zombie Coin on these platforms, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Zombie Coin by entering its contract address – FbkoYsCAPbcyJkSoqXTxDKKoGQrYoqgtdLf9GBEqy2vr – in the receiving field.



In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price.



If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner.




The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum.



This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like ZOMCOIN.

The influence of NFTs on branding is noteworthy. Brands are using NFTs to forge bonds with their customers and provide one-of-a-kind experiences. Through NFTs, brands can offer digital collectibles, virtual merchandise, and privileged access to events or experiences.
Some Ways In Which NFTs Can Impact Branding
Limited Edition Digital Collectibles
Companies such as Nike and Adidas have started introducing collectibles known as NFTs, which are connected to specific products or collections. Fans can purchase, own, and trade these collectibles creating a sense of rarity and exclusivity. This innovative use of NFTs allows brands to tap into the growing market for collectibles while also generating revenue streams.
Virtual Merchandise
NFTs also offer brands an opportunity to create merchandise that can be utilized within virtual reality or gaming environments. For instance, imagine Nike unveiling an edition sneaker that gamers can wear in a popular virtual reality game. This not only enables brands to connect with audiences but also adds an extra layer of engagement and interaction with their products.
Exclusive Access and Experiences
NFTs can serve as passports to events or experiences granting access to devoted fans. Brands can design NFTs that act as tickets for gatherings, meet and greets with celebrities, or behind-the-scenes tours. These immersive encounters not only strengthen the bond between the brand and its customers but also generate excitement and buzz around the brand.

Non-fungible tokens (NFTs) have changed the way that we view ownership of digital assets.

Adidas

Bull rally incoming as Ethereum whale stacks over $32M in ETH since May


Observing the movements of ‘whales’—investors who hold large amounts of cryptocurrency—can offer crucial insights for both traders and investors as they navigate the complex dynamics of the cryptocurrency market. These whales are characterized by their significant capitalization and a proven track record of profitable trading, often influencing market trends and liquidity.
A significant Ethereum (ETH) whale has recently accumulated 10,758 ETH, valued at approximately $32.14 million, through transactions on Binance since May 2. This strategic accumulation follows Ethereum’s nearly 20% decline in value over the past 30 days, although it is still trading slightly above the $3,000 level, marking an approximate 30% increase year-to-date.




The massive transactions occurred from Binance to the wallet address 
‘0x1df0bae09402cb59132c1db349df882d01ca8ee9.
According to data from the on-chain analysis service Lookonchain, this whale withdrew 6,030 ETH tokens, worth over $18 million, from Binance as part of a sustained buying spree since the beginning of the month. This culminated in a total of 10,758 ETH valued at over $32.14 million in their wallet.
The whale subsequently exchanged their ETH for Lido Staked ETH (stETH), a token representing Ether staked on the decentralized liquid staking protocol Lido(LDO). These tokens allow the holder to earn from validating transactions while remaining liquid enough for use in other decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols.
Following this swap, the whale deposited their stETH into the decentralized lending protocol Aave (AAVE) to secure $28.5 million in stablecoins. These were then reinvested into more ETH, showcasing a robust bet on Ethereum’s potential for appreciation.
This behavior illustrates a growing trend among large-scale investors to use DeFi tools to enhance their positions in the cryptocurrency market, particularly Ethereum. By borrowing against their staked ETH, they can maintain their investment while freeing up capital to acquire additional assets, betting on a future rise in Ethereum’s value.
Ethereum price analysis amid massive whale accumulation
Ethereum is currently trading slightly above $3,000, having recently risen by 1.97% in the last 24 hours.

Analysts and investors are closely monitoring these whale movements for signs of a possible market rebound. However, strong resistance around the $3,200 mark and ongoing market challenges suggest that any significant rally might still be some time away.

Many crypto analysts are optimistic, notably prominent analyst Crypto Tony, who offered a bullish outlook with a target price of $2,700 for Ethereum. His analysis coincides with the strategic moves of this whale and signals positive sentiment among well-informed market players regarding the price trajectory of Ethereum.
The recent activities of this Ethereum whale highlight a sophisticated use of decentralized finance to significantly influence market positions.
As Ethereum continues to play a pivotal role in the expanding DeFi ecosystem, such strategic investments by major players are likely to shape its valuation and future market dynamics.

Bonk, Solana's second-largest memecoin and a Crossroads sponsor, is up 6%, while Book of Meme jumped 12%, and Popcat rallied 19.5%.Speaking to The Defiant, Thomas, the co-founder of Kamino, described memecoins as enabling the tokenization of viral culture. “We think that tokenizing virality is the future of France and Kamino is committed to building products to power this economic activity,” he said.King, the co-founder of Bonkbot, a Telegram trading bot, argued on-stage that meme tokens offer a superior mechanism for onboarding retail users than offering legacy trading products within a web3 setting.“I think that memecoins are a good way to onboard retail… they’re a simpler product than other, more complicated products like options,” he said. “A user can look at a meme, and if they laugh, they can buy the meme.”However, Streggs from Flash Point noted that the surge in memecoin trading activity has also driven congestion on Solana, with some users’ trades being included several blocks after their intended execution.“These are markets that can move 30% [to] 50% in a matter of minutes,” he said. “If I made a trade and it landed give blocks later, it would a difference [...] to my [profit and loss].King also noted the memecoin-induced congestion, noting that many Solana traders expect their transactions to execute “within seconds.”“Keeping users safe as well as congestion are the main issues that we face,” he said, acknowledging the prevalence of rug-pulls within the fast and loose memecoin segment. “I’ve been rugged my fair share of times,” King added.

Crypto insider turns $600 into $2.5 million of unrealized profits


A crypto insider has made over $153,000 of realized profits in 15 hours, trading in the Solana (SOL) ecosystem. The cryptocurrency trader started with a purchase worth $600 and currently holds over $2.5 million worth of VibeCat (Minette).
Interestingly, the address purchased the tokens at the same block VibeCat’s developer added the initial liquidity to the decentralized exchange. This is a solid indicator of inside trading, considering Solana blocks have an interval of 400 milliseconds.
As developed, the crypto insider withdrew 3.89 SOL from Binance, worth $600. With this initial amount, the address bought 2.46 Minette less than a second after its creator deposited the first available liquidity for trade.


According to Lookonchain‘s post, the trader sold 1.04 billion Minette for 998.7 SOL 15 hours later, realizing a profit of approximately $153,000. By the time of the post, the insider still held 1.42 billion Minette, valued at around $2.5 million.

Crypto insider rug pull alert
Notably, Lookonchain warned its followers about the risk of a rug pull from VibeCat’s creators and insiders. This is because the creator kept the LP tokens active—received as an “I Owe You” (IOU) for added liquidity.
Burning these IOUs is a common practice when launching a new token to avoid huge dumps, also known as a “rug pull.” Moreover, the insider’s current holdings could create constant selling pressure far above the available liquidity, impacting Minette’s price.
This is another example of how crypto insiders often take advantage of retail by creating and launching meme coins and money-grab schemes. They benefit from information asymmetry and the hype of a market that insists on gambling with poor fundamental digital assets.
Cryptocurrencies are inherently volatile and present considerable risks for traders, investors, and users, even with solid and usable projects. However, trading meme coins adds another layer of risks that will often drain money from many to a few insiders.
For this reason, investors should avoid these schemes and look for a cryptocurrency‘s fundamentals, cautiously researching supply and demand properties.

Nano Reinvents Itself as Web3 Gaming Platform | Cryptopolitan

The Nano project is once again trying to regain the spotlight by adding Web3 features and trying to stand out as a gaming platform. Nano was one of the projects to appear during the bull market of 2017 and 2018, promising to become the digital money of the future. The token went through several booms and busts, finally rebranding itself with a new ticker, XNO. During the 2024 market expansion, XNO closely tracked Bitcoin’s growth, but so far, XNO has remained unchanged in Satoshi’s terms. XNO established a new price range in 2024, trading up to a yearly peak of $1.60. Later, XNO took a step back and consolidated at $1.16.As a payment tool, Nano was almost instant and extremely cheap to use. The coin relied on turning every mobile wallet into a node, propagating transactions with high speed and security. But the Nano project also suffered after the hack of the BitGrail exchange, where it crashed during the 2018 crypto winter.Nano Tries to Attract Sustainable Web3 GamesThe Nano network tries to find the right balance with Web3 gaming, which also offers earnings for the best performers. Play-to-earn games exploded in 2021, issuing millions of new tokens for all players. However, the model was not sustainable, and most games had to adapt or disappear. Nano is trying to bring the next generation of games with more sustainable rewards for playing. The XNO token itself will now become a reward, powering a new game ecosystem. Nano has retained a growing community over the years, though always facing the challenge of low token value. What Changed for Nano After Surviving Two Bear MarketsNano was formerly known as RAI Blocks, an attempt to reinvent global payments. The project always had grass-roots support and proved itself reliable as a way of sending value. Nano also gained support from the Litecoin community. Since then, Nano turned to new use cases and applications. The goal is to make XNO usable for services and activities to build up organic demand in the long term. One of the use cases is Nano GPT, where XNO is used to pay for premium prompts. Nano is perfectly adapted for microtransactions, due to its low latency and negligible fees. Microtransactions remove the need for subscriptions, giving access to several LLM. The Nano network is also resistant to spam and may handle increased traffic linked to gaming or Web3 use cases. XNO microtransactions have also been applied to decentralized streaming. XNO has been paid out for filling out surveys or other micro-tasks. The advantage of XNO is that it fulfills the task of a token for small payments and rewards, without the need to use another blockchain.On a usual day, the Nano blockchain is supported by around 122 online peers. Nano still has fewer than 500K wallets reported, but the network is capable of growing and scaling with each user. For now, Nano also has no central consensus server and has seldom reported lost coin balances. Nano Returns to Faucet-Based AdoptionAfter years of spectacular runs and crashes, XNO may not guarantee a new hike to a higher range. XNO remains a low-value asset still trying to get back in the spotlight. This also means XNO is accumulated and distributed to a wide community. Several faucet-like tools exist for Nano users, in the form of micro-payments or rewards for tasks and missions. During its initial distribution, XNO tokens were also distributed by a faucet that was open for more than a year before trading launched.This time, Nano faucets can be created by anyone, giving out incentives through microtransactions. The sums from the faucets are small, but they can drive real activity tied to games or other reward mechanisms. One of the setbacks of the Nano network is that it still has no decentralized finance. Even the Nano Swap exchange is practically illiquid. Nano also does not carry NFT or allow for other infrastructure tied to Web3. Instead, the XNO token uses its chief features – no fees and instant transfers – to become the basic unit of account for any type of project.
