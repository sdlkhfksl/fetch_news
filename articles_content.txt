Hong Kong Crypto ETFs Witness Record $40 Million in Outflows ⋆ ZyCrypto

&nbsp

&nbsp
Hong Kong’s recently launched Bitcoin and Ethereum Exchange Traded Funds (ETFs) witnessed considerable outflows on Monday. Despite these ETFs experiencing two weeks of consecutive inflows, one bad day at the start of this week virtually wiped out the gains made in the last two weeks.



How Did Hong Kong ETFs Fare?



The newly launched crypto ETFs witnessed the largest outflow since their listing in the Asian market. This is despite the American ETFs recording a net inflow of $66 million on the same day.



Hong Kong’s Bitcoin ETFs include AMC, Harvest, and Bosera. They reported outflows of $15.5 million, $9.8 million, and $7.4 million, respectively. Ethereum ETFs include exchange offerings by the same three companies, and they reported outflows of $3 million, $3 million, and $0.6 million, respectively.



Many investors viewed Hong Kong’s listing of Bitcoin and ETH ETFs favorably. For crypto enthusiasts, it meant that the digital currency was going further mainstream and could attract investments from this side of the world as well.



Further emphasis was placed on Hong Kong’s interesting political situation, which could pour billions into the crypto scene. Many of these funds don’t have access to crypto investments because they are from mainland China, where holding, buying, and selling crypto is banned entirely.

Are the Hong Kong Crypto ETFs in Trouble?



Hong Kong is a global financial capital that attracts billions of dollars in investments. The country is governed by the One Country, Two Systems model. It was once part of the British Empire but was returned to China under an agreement. Hong Kong remained a free market despite being handed over to mainland China under the said agreement.



Asians, including Chinese, have a higher rate of crypto adoption than many other ethnicities. This is despite facing massive regulatory challenges in their home countries. China has banned crypto entirely, while countries like South Korea and Japan regulate it extensively. 



However, this hasn’t stopped tech-savvy investors from acquiring scarce digital assets, especially the top ones like Bitcoin and ETH. 



But why aren’t they interested in ETFs?



First of all, the Hong Kong crypto ETFs are still in their nascent stage, and it would be unwise to rule them out right now. Second, the listing of these ETFs has come at a time when the digital currency’s price index is quite stagnant overall, and no major price pump has occurred in several weeks, resulting in poor performance of ETFs overall, not just those listed on the Hong Kong exchanges.



Still, it is a cause of concern for these new ETF funds. They need to start doing better soon to be taken as a legitimate investment tool like their American counterparts.

Big Airdrop Will Finally Be Distributed On Wednesday: Here are the Expectations and Details - Bitcoin Sistemi

Solana-based decentralized exchange (DEX) Drift Protocol is preparing to distribute airdrops two days later, on May 16 at 15:00 Turkey time (UTC+3), according to the official blog post.
DRIFT was added to the listing roadmap by Coinbase today and can be listed on this exchange immediately after launch.


The introduction of the new token follows a three-month points program that has attracted traders, borrowers, lenders and airdrop farmers to Drift. The platform is considered one of the largest venues for continuous trading in Solana's DeFi ecosystem. However, protocol contributors have noted that most of the 100 million tokens initially allocated for this airdrop will be allocated to long-term Drift users.
12% of the airdrop, which corresponds to a total of 120 million tokens, will be distributed to eligible Drift users. Distribution will be made according to users' activities on the platform.






Holders of this token will have the power to vote on important decisions such as which tokens will be listed on the exchange or when the software will be updated. In the first wave airdrop, ten percent of DRIFT's total supply will be allocated to its users.
Venture supporters will receive a significant 22% share of DRIFT. A group of angel investors, including leading cryptocurrency venture capital firms Polychain Capital and Multicoin Capital and Solana founders Anatoly Yakovenko and Raj Gokal, have invested over $25 million in the development of the protocol since 2021.


A significant 43% of the tokens will be directed towards “ecosystem development”, which could include trading rewards, liquidity incentives and future airdrops. Additionally, as stated on Drift's website, 25% of the tokens are reserved for “protocol development” payments to Drift contributors.

Will Ethereum Be Declared a Security By the SEC Next Week? - Decrypt

The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) may soon assert that Ethereum is a security in its expected rejections of several spot Ethereum ETF applications, a lawyer who specializes in digital assets warned Tuesday.The regulator is due to decide on VanEck’s application for such a product on May 23, followed by a final decision deadline for ARK Invest/21Shares’ application the next day. BlackRock, Fidelity, and Grayscale also have applications on the SEC’s desk.In March, the SEC put forth potential “grounds for [the] disapproval” of BlackRock’s application and Nasdaq’s proposal to list BlackRock’s product. One question the SEC posed in its notice is whether Nasdaq “properly filed its proposal” under the exchange’s rules for so-called Commodity-Based Trust Shares.Requiring that trusts hold a “specified commodity,” Scott Johnson, a general partner at Van Buren Capital, described the question’s inclusion as telling. “The obvious purpose is to potentially deny on the basis that these spot filings are improperly filed as commodity-based trust shares and do not qualify if they are holding a security,” he wrote on Twitter.Rather than indirectly excluding the digital asset as a commodity, the SEC could explicitly assert that Ethereum is a regulated security in its expected ETF denials. But that’s “highly unlikely,” Terrence Yang, a managing director at Swan Bitcoin told Decrypt.“Gensler and his team, they’re political animals,” he said, arguing that the political backdrop surrounding crypto has grown too tense for a move that would likely spark backlash from crypto-friendly politicians, including Former President Donald Trump.Following the SEC’s approval of spot Bitcoin ETFs in January, hopes that spot Ethereum ETFs will get the same treatment have plummeted. On the blockchain-based prediction platform Polymarket, traders penciled in a pessimistic 16% chance that ETFs are approved this month, as of this writing.Even though SEC Chair Gary Gensler has publicly affirmed that Bitcoin is a commodity, the Wall-Street cop has been tight-lipped when it comes to Ethereum, refusing to answer questions about the cryptocurrency’s regulatory status as recently as March.Last month, a lawsuit filed by the Ethereum software company Consensys alleged that the SEC has internally viewed Ethereum as a security for over a year. Among other requests, the firm asked a federal judge in Texas to declare Ethereum is a commodity.Prior to its approval of spot Bitcoin ETFs in January, the SEC denied similar applications for a decade, citing concerns of fraud and market manipulation in Bitcoin’s spot market. So-called surveillance agreements monitoring the Bitcoin futures market for ETFs that were already approved wouldn’t be sufficient, the SEC said.Eventually, a federal appellate court found that logic faulty, ordering the SEC to vacate its previous rejection of Grayscale’s application to convert its flagship trust into an ETF. Given the SEC approved Ethereum futures ETFs last October, Yang said a similar headache for the regulator could follow if it points to market manipulation again.“They can do it, but they should expect to get sued, and I think they'll get attacked politically through the heavy lobbying that the well-funded crypto industry has,” he said.Edited by Ryan Ozawa.Stay on top of crypto news, get daily updates in your inbox.

SEC tries again for Debt Box suit dismissal with option to refile

The United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has made another move in its attempt to have its case against cryptocurrency mining software firm Digital Licensing, doing business as Debt Box, dismissed. The agency filed a reply to its motion for the court to dismiss the case without prejudice, which would allow the agency to sue Debt Box again. The U.S. District Court for Utah Northern Division sanctioned the SEC for “gross abuse of power” and dismissed its first attempt to have the case dismissed without prejudice. It also ordered that Debt Box should receive reimbursement of legal fees. Debt Box asked the court not to dismiss the case without prejudice, calling the move a ploy to avoid permanent dismissal. The SEC reply in support of its motion to dismiss the Debt Box case without prejudice. Source: PACERThe SEC argued that the ability to refile an action was in the interests of Debt Box investors, and precedent showed that the court “normally should grant” a plaintiff’s request for dismissal without prejudice. It stated:“The SEC seeks dismissal without prejudice to allow the new team of attorneys assigned to the case to analyze the case file and take additional investigative steps before determining whether or not to proceed with a new complaint.” The SEC’s lead attorneys in the case resigned after the agency was sanctioned by the court. Related: US senators call SEC actions in Debt Box case ‘unconscionable’If a dismissal were granted without prejudice, Debt Box sought to impose 11 conditions on the SEC if it refiled a case. The SEC agreed in whole or in part to most of those conditions. One condition was the use of a Wells notice—a warning from the SEC that intends to bring charges—and the completion of investigation files. The SEC sought to limit the material it would provide with the notice. Source: paulgrewal.ethThe SEC opposed a condition requiring it to provide Debt Box with all material it subpoenaed in the case and to have a representative present at non-subpoenaed interviews in the investigation. Finally, it opposed a condition to produce potentially exculpatory information—information that would be favorable to the defendant—from its investigation. Debt Box is accused of defrauding investors of $50 million and selling unregistered securities in the form of licenses to use their software to mine digital assets. The SEC temporarily froze the company’s assets in August. This decision led to the agency being sanctioned when the court found that it had used a “false narrative” relating to the company’s purported plans to relocate outside the United States to justify it. The SEC expressed its “deep regrets” over that action. Magazine: Crypto regulation: Does SEC Chair Gary Gensler have the final say?

Crypto investment funds intake $130M, while filings reveal new spot BTC ETF purchasers

Cryptocurrency investment products saw inflows totaling $130 million in the week ending May 6, reversing a five-week streak of outflows, according to CoinShares. According to CoinShares’ “Digital Asset Fund Flows Weekly” report published on May 13, institutional investors increased their exposure to digital assets, with crypto investment products seeing total inflows of $130 million this past week.Once again, the lion’s share of movement was attributed to Bitcoin (BTC) investment funds, which received $144 million in inflows.Capital flows for crypto investment products.

Normally, you don't get these big fish institutions in the 13Fs for a year or so (when the ETF gets more liquidity), but as we've seen, these are no ordinary launches.”Balchunas believes this is a good sign for the market, adding, “Expect more, as institutions tend to move in herds.”The disclosure signifies a significant move by SWIB into the digital asset market by the Wisconsin Investment Committee. Spot Bitcoin ETFs offer investors exposure to Bitcoin without needing to own the cryptocurrency directly. This move by the Wisconsin Investment Committee could potentially signal a growing adoption of crypto investment products among traditional finance firms.This article does not contain investment advice or recommendations.

Insider at Solana's (SOL) Cypher Protocol Admits to Stealing $300K

Hoak's admission comes one day after Cypher's founder Barrett accused him of systematically draining troves of valuable cryptos from the protocol's redemption contract over multiple months, beginning in December. Citing on-chain data, Barrett said Hoak ultimately sent assets worth around $300,000 (at current market prices) to Binance, presumably to cash them out.

Filing suggests SEC is exploring grounds to deny spot Ether ETFs

Analysts have unearthed details from a March filing with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) that suggest the regulator may consider labeling Ether (ETH) a security.In a May 13 X post, Davis Polk and Wardwell Associate Scott Johnsson reviewed a March 4 filing from BlackRock over its application to list and trade a spot Ether exchange-traded fund on the Nasdaq. The filing delayed the deadline for the commission to decide on a spot Ether ETF from BlackRock until June but also called for public feedback on whether the investment vehicle could be filed as a commodity.“The obvious purpose is to potentially deny on the basis that these spot filings are improperly filed as commodity-based trust shares and do not qualify if they are holding a security,” said Johnsson.Source: SECAccording to Bloomberg ETF analyst Eric Balchunas, the SEC filing was “buried 50 feet deep in a pile of legalese,” but this did not change his speculation the regulator’s odds of signing off on a spot Ether ETF were “slim to none.” The SEC must decide whether to approve or deny VanEck’s spot Ether ETF by May 23 — the first in several applications waiting in the pipeline.Related: Traders rush to short Ether as Grayscale pulls its futures ETF planShould the SEC deny VanEck’s application, the commission could turn down spot Ether ETFs from ARK 21Shares, Hashdex, Invesco Galaxy, BlackRock and Fidelity. Grayscale withdrew its spot Ether ETF application on May 7 without explanation. VanEck CEO Jan van Eck reportedly doubted that the SEC would approve his company’s offering in May. Central to the SEC’s decision is whether the commission considers ETH a security or commodity. Despite many previous public statements from Chair Gary Gensler declaring ETH was not a security, reports suggest that the commission has launched a probe into Ether.

Here Are The Meme Coins To Buy For Dogecoin-Like Gains If There Is A Repeat Of The 2021 Mania | Bitcoinist.com


								The return of Keith Gill (also known as “Roaring Kitty”), the man who largely contributed to the GameStop short squeeze in 2021, and the Dogecoin run, has led to talks about another imminent meme coin mania. If so, some meme coins are worth watching, as they could be the biggest beneficiaries of such development. 
Pepe (PEPE) And Dogwifhat (WIF) Could Lead The Way For Meme Coins
PEPE and WIF look set to lead the way if there is another meme coin mania due to Gill’s return. Gill was at the helm of the GameStop saga in 2021 when a group of Reddit traders staged a financial revolution against hedge fund managers who had been shorting the retail company’s stock. This led to GameStop’s stock rising from under $3 to $483 in under a month.

This event is believed to have paved the way for the meme coin frenzy, which began afterwards as many retail investors came into crypto following that event. This led to a parabolic rally in the prices of different meme coins, including the foremost ones, Dogecoin and Shiba Inu. However, with Dogecoin and Shiba Inu looking to have lost most of their bullish momentum, newer meme coins like Pepe, WIF, and even Bonk could lead the way this time around. 
These newer meme coins have recorded significant gains in the last 24 hours since Gill made his first X (formerly Twitter) post announcing his return. Specifically, Pepe has been the largest gainer among the top-ranked meme coins, posting a price gain of over 25%, according to data from CoinMarketCap. WIF and BONK have also recorded price increases of 11% and 9%, respectively. 
Dogecoin and Shiba Inu also recorded significant price gains. However, in the long run, Pepe, WIF, and BONK are expected to outshine the two largest meme coins by market cap since they have more room to make parabolic moves to the upside. 
Meanwhile, Gill’s return can also be considered timely since meme coins were already projected to be one of the leading narratives for this bull run. As such, this can further ignite a notable surge in the meme coin market. 
The Event That Leads To Mainstream Adoption
Crypto expert Scott Melker predicted that mainstream crypto adoption would return when Dogecoin hits a new all-time high (ATH). However, Gill’s return could very well be the event that marks the return of retail investors into the crypto space. Moreover, what happened following his return makes a strong case for why crypto is the future of finance. 

The New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) was reported to have halted the trading of GameStop’s stock due to its volatility following Gill’s numerous X posts. Such an occurrence is impossible on-chain, which could further convince traditional finance (TradFi) traders that using decentralized protocols is a better option. 
Unlike the NYSE, these decentralized exchanges didn’t halt trading despite the GameStop (GME) meme coin, which isn’t affiliated with the retail company, soaring by over 3000% in a single day.

Out of Danger? Bitcoin Price Could Soon Enter Parabolic Phase, Analyst Says | Cryptoglobe


                                
The price of the flagship cryptocurrency Bitcoin has recently recovered from a drop to a low under the $57,000 mark to now trade above the $62,000 mark, with one analyst suggesting BTC needs to remain above the $60,000 level to soon enter a parabolic phase.



According to popular cryptocurrency analyst Rekt Capital, who shared his thoughts on the microblogging platform X (formerly known as Twitter) with their over 460,000 followers, Bitcoin’s price post-halving is officially out of the “danger zone,” and the cryptocurrency’s price celebrated with a good bounce from the Re-Accumulation Range Low support.”







The analyst, as reported, has revealed that Bitcoin’s price goes through three phases at each halving event, with the first phase being a pre-halving retrace that includes a price drop, which in this cycle was of over 23%, which is critical to set the stage for the next stage, the re-accumulation phase.



This phase, the analyst defends, establishes  the foundation for subsequent price movements. During this phase, Bitcoin’s price consolidates within a defined range, characterized by pullbacks and sideways movements—a reflection of normal range-bound behavior as the market tempers the preceding rally.







            
            

            
            

            
            

        

While the re-accumulation phase can last months, it leads to the parabolic uptrend phase, in which Bitcoin’s price enters a period of accelerated growth.



Rekt Capital noted that this month and the next may be “unremarkable for Bitcoin,” but added that we’re “running out of unremarkable months” before BTC enters the parabolic phase.







As CryptoGlobe reported, Wall Street behemoth Susquehanna International Group, known for its vast trading volume across global financial products, has significantly increased its exposure to the flagship cryptocurrency Bitcoin, amassing a $1.2 billion position on it in Q1 2024.



According to a recent 13-HR filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), Susquehanna International now holds a massive17,271,326 shares in the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC), valued at roughly $1.09 billion as of March 31, as well as 1,349,414 shares of Fidelity’s spot Bitcoin ETF (FBTC), valued at approximately $83.74 million.

Lucky GameStop, AMC Traders ‘Turned Thousands into Millions’ - Decrypt

Subscribe now to Alpha Reports and up your game!Go to Alpha ReportsTraders who were fortunate enough to have bought in early on the latest meme stock craze are making away with huge gains. Unusual Whales, which tracks trading data, posted on Twitter the activity of one trader who invested $27,000 in call contracts on April 24 when they were priced at $0.21 a pop. The contracts then peaked at $13.63, meaning the investment would have reaped gains of 6,400%—turning $27,000 into $2 million, according to the firm. In another post, the data platform showed the trading movements of someone who exited after gains of 4,000% gains following a $32,000 buy-in of AMC Entertainment (AMC) stock options nine days before Roaring Kitty’s Twitter account sprang back to life on Sunday.Call contracts give buyers the right to buy a stock at a specified price and date—but not the obligation. It’s unclear how investors who held onto GME through the 2021 boom and bust have fared versus newcomers in the latest hype cycle. Unusual Whales did not immediately respond to a request for comment from Decrypt.Meme stock mania returned to markets Monday after an internet figure who inspired the 2021 GameStop rally posted online for the first time in years. Over the past five days, GME stock is now up over 200%. Roaring Kitty (whose real name is Keith Gill) helped fuel the 2021 rally via Reddit posts and livestreams. On Sunday night, his first tweet in nearly three years inspired traders to snap up meme stocks and meme digital coins and tokens.Back in 2021, shares in dying companies like GameStop became popular on internet forums after amateur traders started pumping them. This led to chaos on Wall Street—and government intervention—after hedge funds that had shorted the stocks lost out after they suddenly went up in value. Cryptocurrencies experienced a boom at the time too, with meme coins and tokens in particular going up in value. They have since experienced a resurgence and some now make up the top digital assets by market cap. The virtual assets—which are based on Internet jokes and are usually extremely volatile—have this week shot up in value along with traditional stocks.Edited by Ryan Ozawa.Stay on top of crypto news, get daily updates in your inbox.

                        A recent influx of investor disclosures has Bitwise, one of the United States’ leading Bitcoin ETF providers, “incredibly bullish” on BTC.The Top Institutional Bitcoin ETF Owners
In a recent memo, Bitwise CIO Matt Hougan reviewed some of the newly uncovered Bitcoin ETF buyers, who have revealed their allocations as part of mandatory 13F filings with regulators in recent weeks.A 13F filing is a form required by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) of all investors with $100 million in assets under management, disclosing their entire ownership of publicly traded securities. Thousands of investors have now filed their Q1 2024 reports – the first reporting period during which Bitcoin spot ETFs have been live.“A lot of professional investors own bitcoin ETFs.” Hougan wrote, taking note of iconic asset managers like Hightower Advisors, which owns $68 million in the new funds. Another includes Bracebridge Capital, a Boston-based hedge fund holding a much larger $434 million in Bitcoin.Based on all filings submitted by May 9, a total of 563 professional investment firms were identified as having bought the ETFs, with allocations worth $3.5 billion in total. That doesn’t include those filing between then and May 15, such as the State of Wisconsin Investment Board (SWIB), which reported a $162 million allocation to Bitcoin on Tuesday.Why Bitwise Is Bullish On Bitcoin ETFs
According to Hougan, it’s very uncommon for ETFs to attract so many 13F filers in their first few months live. “From a breadth of ownership perspective, the bitcoin ETFs are a historic success,” he wrote.But that doesn’t mean Bitcoin ETF buyers have dried up already. Based on the data, it seems the vast majority of buyers until now have been retail-based, with professional investors only starting to dip their toes in.“Most professional investors take 6-12 months to evaluate crypto,” Hougan said, noting that allocations to crypto after one client meeting are “extremely rare.”Next, those investors usually make personal allocations to test the water, before making isolated allocations on behalf of their more pro-crypto clients later on.Finally, after about 6 months, those firms will start making “platform-wide allocations” with their whole client book, comprising 1% to 5% of their entire portfolio. For context, current allocations made by investors like HighTower comprise just 0.05% of their portfolios.“A 1% allocation of their portfolio to bitcoin would equate to $1.2 billion—all from a single firm,” Hougan wrote. “Multiply that by the growing number of professional investors participating in the space, and you can begin to see what’s behind my enthusiasm.”

MAGA Shiba Inu (MAGASHIB) to Skyrocket 13,000% Before MEXC Listing, While Shiba Inu and Dogecoin Struggle



                    

MAGA Shiba Inu (MAGASHIB) could turn early investors into multi-millionaires if it becomes a mainstream coin, like Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE).



MAGA Shiba Inu (MAGASHIB), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is poised to explode over 13,000% in price in the coming days.




This is because MAGASHIB has announced its first centralized exchange listing, which will be on MEXC – one of the largest exchanges in the world.



This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up.



Currently, MAGA Shiba Inu can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jupiter and Raydium, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days.




Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and MAGA Shiba Inu could become the next viral memecoin.



MAGA Shiba Inu launched with over $7,000 of locked liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains.



To buy MAGA Shiba Inu on Raydium or Jupiter ahead of the MEXC listing, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for MAGA Shiba Inu by entering its contract address – 73mqxPkM9P59GeudJ2DT8i2v94QfLkfVVbfQnU2DTP5r – in the receiving field.



In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price.




If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner.



The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum.



This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like MAGASHIB.

Ripple Sells $75 Million Worth of XRP Amid Market Downturn, Data Shows | Cryptoglobe


                                
Ripple, the company holding the largest reserves of XRP, has sold 150 million tokens on May 13 in a $75 million sale that represents around 0.25% of XRP’s total market capitalization, currently around $28 billion.



The sale comes after Ripple released 1 billion XRP in the beginning of the month, with these tokens originally being locked in monthly escrows until 2027. Ripple allocated 200 million to its treasury account and placed the remaining 800 million in new escrows.



The sale was executed through Ripple’s treasury account, labeled “Ripple (1),” on the XRP Ledger explorer XRPScan, as first reported by Finbold, which transferred tokens to an unlabeled account, “rP4X2…sKxv3.”



This process effectively introduced new XRP into circulation, potentially adding inflationary pressure and adding to XRP’s annual inflation rate above the 4% mark. After Ripple’s release the destination account kept 50 million XRP and sent 100 million tokens to an address associated with its sales on the market.



If this pattern holds true, the additional 150 million XRP could create downward pressure on the price of XRP in the spot market. XRP is at the time of writing trading at $0.5 per token after dropping around 5% over the past week amid a wider cryptocurrency market correction.







            
            

            
            

            
            

        

As CryptoGlobe reported  a cryptocurrency analyst has recently suggested the cryptocurrency’s price could be set for a significant upswing, pointing to  a symmetrical triangle on the cryptocurrency’s weekly chart, from which XRP could soon break out of.



The price of XRP has been trapped within this triangle for several years, reflecting a potential tug-of-war between buyers and sellers. A successful breakout, Carter said, would see XRP move upward significantly.



Should a breakout from the symmetrical triangle materialize, Carter projects an initial surge towards $0.93, a level XRP briefly touched in July 2023 following a positive development in the ongoing legal battle with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).



However, Carter believes XRP will surpass this resistance level and reach a more ambitious mid-term target of $1.68, representing a staggering increase of over 200% from its current price level.

UK closes ‘trust me bro’ crypto firm that gave horrible advice to clients

United Kingdom authorities have officially shut down a crypto academy, claiming the founder used it to “recklessly persuade” people to partake in loss-making investment schemes, including an alleged $1.7 billion crypto “Ponzi.”According to the United Kingdom government agency The Insolvency Service, Amey Finance Academy offered advice to people looking to invest in various cryptocurrency schemes. However, some customers lost their entire investments based on misleading promises made by the firm’s sole director and shareholder.In WhatsApp messages seen by investigators, Amey allegedly told one customer that their investments were a “100 certy” and to “trust me bro.”Amey allegedly told another customer that their investment wouldn’t fall below 90% — but they ended up losing everything.“Desmond Amey used Amey Finance Academy to recklessly persuade individuals to invest in cryptocurrency schemes and mislead them about the risks of doing so,” said Mark George, chief investigator at the Insolvency Service. Source: Insolvency ServiceIt comes two weeks after the Insolvency Service secured a winding-up order against Amey’s firm in the U.K. High Court on April 30.One of the cryptocurrency schemes promoted by the firm was HyperFund — later known as HyperVerse — an alleged Ponzi scheme that went unchecked by Australian authorities for nearly two years.Two of the lead operators behind HyperVerse have since been charged by the United States securities regulator, which claims the firm ran a $1.7 billion fraud scheme.Related: OneCoin’s legal boss gets 4 years jail for massive $4B crypto scamHowever, Amey’s failure to provide up-to-date accounting records meant the Insolvency Service couldn’t establish the true relationship between Amey Finance Academy and HyperVerse. This lack of transparency left the Insolvency Service with no option but to seek a wind-up order, George explained.“The public deserve protection from companies trading in an opaque and objectionable manner which is why we applied to have Amey Finance Academy shut down.”About $6.3 million (5 million Great Britain pounds) passed through Amey Finance Academy’s bank account between October 2019 and March 2022, but the firm’s assets and liabilities weren’t able to be ascertained.Amey’s firm launched in December 2018, claiming to be “an established and successful independent consultancy providing a plethora of financial services.”Cointelegraph reached out to Desmond Amey for comment.Magazine: Ethereum’s ERC-20 design flaws are a crypto scammer’s best friend

Why Conviction of Tornado Cash Dev Has Sparked Outrage - DailyCoin


        

A Dutch court has found Tornado Cash developer Alexey Pertsev guilty of money laundering.



Outrage has trailed the court decision.



The outrage comes as many worry about the precedent the ruling sets for crypto and technological development in general.




After nearly two years, the trial of Tornado Cash developer Alexey Pertsev has come to a head.



The developer was charged with money laundering in the Netherlands in November 2022, as authorities sought to hold him responsible for criminal elements, including North Korean hackers, using the privacy protocol to launder stolen cryptocurrency worth billions of dollars. 




On Tuesday, May 14, a ruling was finally issued in the case, setting what many have described as a horrible precedent for the industry.



Pertsev Conviction Sparks Outrage 



On Tuesday, May 14, a Dutch court found Pertsev guilty of laundering $1.2 billion on Tornado Cash and sentenced the developer to 64 months or five years and four months in prison.



According to a translated summary of the ruling, the court found that the developer’s failure to implement controls to prevent abuse of the protocol, even after discovering that criminal elements were using it, made him responsible for the abuse. The ruling, however, has sparked outrage within the crypto community.



Former KPMG France Blockchain and Crypto Director Alexandre Stachtchenko asserted:




"This has gone too far. It is time to end this KYC and surveillance mess before it eats democracy itself."



Independent crypto journalist Lola L33tz described the ruling as “insane,” adding that it practically outlawed building any privacy service.







ConsenSys lawyer Bill Hughes described the ruling as “among the most chilling lines” crypto industry participants will ever read.



These views go beyond privacy concerns; many worry about the precedent it sets for crypto and technological development in general.



An Affront on The Freedom of Expression?



For many, the Tornado Cash case raises the question of whether developers should be held responsible for how their code is used.



“We don’t hold Microsoft responsible when drug gangs use Excel to keep track of their profits. 



We don’t arrest Apple executives when criminals plot crimes using FaceTime.  We don’t prosecute the NYSE because people can use it for insider trading,” Morrison Cohen Partner Jason Gottlieb stressed while explaining that code should not be illegal even though the abuse of it may be.



Gottlieb argued that code, like speech, was a form of expression protected by the First Amendment.



"We should not abuse fundamental rights to pursue even terrible criminals," he wrote.



Beyond the Pertsev case in the Netherlands, two other Tornado Cash developers, Roman Storm, and Roman Semenov, face similar money laundering charges in the U.S. The trial is set to begin on September 23.



While some experts have argued that the Netherlands case is not indicative of what could happen in the U.S., in 2023, a U.S. court rejected a Coinbase-backed effort to overturn the U.S. Treasury’s Office of Foreign Asset Control (OFAC) sanction on Tornado Cash. The judge found that the protocol and its DAO operated as a corporation as opposed to claims that it was just a piece of code.



On the Flipside 




Pertsev has 14 days to appeal his conviction.



Semenov remains at large.



Ethereum founder Vitalik Buterin has recently endorsed Railgun, a Tornado Cash alternative that implements “privacy pools” to make it difficult for bad actors to use the tool.




Why This Matters 



The conviction of Tornado Cash’s Alexey Pertsev sets a powerful precedent for crypto and technology development, raising questions about the extent to which developers can be blamed for how their software is used.

Here’s why US debt is out of control - and Japanese debt isn’t

On the face of it, the United States' debt to GDP ratio doesn’t seem that bad on a global scale. In 2023, it was lower than the average for G7 nations — at 123% — and roughly half of the most indebted country in the world, Japan, where debt stood at a whopping 255% of GDP in 2023.Looking at the numbers alone, it would be easy to brush this off as a non-issue. After all, Japan has managed to navigate its growing debt pile relatively well over the years. Its economy remains stable, while the Nikkei 225 index is up around 31% over the last year (as of May 10), outperforming the S&P 500. In reality, though, the economic situations in the two countries couldn’t be more different, which means that what works for Japan is unlikely to work for the U.S.The glaring difference between the two is the composition of their debt ownership. In Japan, nearly 90% of debt is owned domestically by its citizens and institutions. By contrast, roughly a quarter of U.S. debt is held by international debt buyers. And so needs to ensure that its debt remains attractive to them by paying a high enough yield versus its global competitors — especially as this debt rises to higher and higher percentages of GDP, meaning that it becomes riskier to lend to the government.Related: Jerome Powell’s pivot heralds a boring summer for BitcoinIndeed, last year Fitch Ratings already downgraded U.S. government debt from AAA to AA+. At the time, this news was brushed off by U.S. officials as “arbitrary and based on outdated data.” Later in the year, Moody’s downgraded its U.S. debt outlook to negative, which was also largely ignored by markets. But investors should be paying more attention because the U.S. won’t be able to sit back and let its debt soar to the levels seen in Japan. For one thing, Japan’s net debt is much lower than its gross debt-to-GDP ratio, meaning it holds more foreign assets than it owes to other countries — the exact opposite of the US. This makes it easier for Japan to manage its growing debt pile. Map of debt-to-GDP ratios around the world as of 2022. (Dark green signifies a higher ratio, while orange signifies a ratio of less than 25%.) Source: International Monetary FundJapan also hasn’t struggled with inflation nearly to the same extent as the United States. Its inflation rate sits at 2.7% after peaking at just 4.3% in January 2023. That's a far cry from the 9.1% the U.S. reached in June 2022. The Federal Reserve is still struggling to bring sticky inflation under control, which makes the soaring debt levels particularly dangerous as this can add fuel to the fire.The answer to inflation, as we all know, is restrictive monetary policy. But higher interest rates mean higher debt repayments, unhappy consumers, and — eventually — a slowing economy. Indeed, the Fed is already facing all of these problems. Consumer confidence is beginning to falter, debt repayments topped $1 trillion last year and first-quarter growth this year came in much lower than anyone anticipated. So much so that we’re now hearing whispers of stagflation — a particularly undesirable economic situation, where inflation continues to rise while economic growth stagnates. Here, higher debt also creates a problem, since it limits the government’s ability to use its fiscal powers to mitigate a slowing economy. So the Federal Reserve finds itself in a bit of a catch-22 situation, especially considering that it has all but promised a rate cut next.Related: The next ICO boom is coming — and it will be better than 2018In an election year, keeping interest rates high for too long could also spell an unhappy electorate. However, so far, both Democrat and Republican candidates appear to be entirely ignoring the elephant in the room that is the growing U.S. debt pile. Neither side has proposed any meaningful policies to address this issue. But, with the debt-to-GDP ratio now at well over 100% and projected to keep rising quickly over the coming decades, the government will have to face the music sooner or later. So what does this mean for crypto? Paradoxically, all this may be a net benefit for assets like Bitcoin, which could become a safe haven as worries over soaring U.S. debt intensify. Typically, rising debt levels also lead to currency devaluation. And while, like Japan, the U.S. may be able to avoid some of this due to the global reliance on the U.S. dollar, the high proportion of foreign debt ownership also makes the greenback particularly vulnerable. Coupled with the expectations of interest rate cuts later this year, there is little chance that the dollar will maintain its current strength for too long. This, of course, will be a boon for Bitcoin (BTC), which is widely seen as a hedge against dollar weakness. So this predicament the U.S. finds itself in isn’t necessarily bad news for cryptocurrency markets, depending on quite how badly out of hand things get. If the U.S. were to default on its debt, for example — which, of course, it won’t. This would be disastrous for all markets, including digital assets. A weaker dollar and some loss of confidence in the U.S., however, could be just what the doctor ordered for the next leg of the crypto rally.

Trader Predicts 1,660% Rally for Under-the-Radar Altcoin, Updates Outlook on Shiba Inu and Chainlink - The Daily Hodl


								A closely followed crypto strategist believes that astronomical gains are on the horizon for an altcoin initially built on the Ethereum (ETH) blockchain.
Analyst Ali Martinez tells his 62,100 followers on the social media platform X that the native asset of a supply-chain management project VeChain (VET) appears to be mirroring its previous cycle’s market structure.










If VET continues to follow the script, Martinez predicts that the altcoin will print staggering gains of more than 1,660% before the year expires.
“Fractals indicate that VeChain (VET) is set for a rebound this summer, with a potentially explosive growth in the fall.” 
Source: Ali Martinez/X
Looking at the trader’s chart, he seems to predict that VET will rally to as high as $0.60 toward the end of 2024. At time of writing, VET is worth $0.0339.
Next up, Martinez says that memecoin Shiba Inu (SHIB) looks poised for a breakout rally.
“If Shiba Inu breaks the upper boundary of this descending parallel channel at $0.00002444, SHIB could witness a 20% upswing to $0.00002954!” 
Source: Ali Martinez/X
A descending parallel channel is typically a bearish structure indicating that an asset is in a downtrend. At time of writing, SHIB is worth $0.0000233.
The last altcoin on Martinez’s radar is the decentralized oracle network Chainlink (LINK). According to the trader, the Tom DeMark (TD) Sequential Indicator has flipped bullish for LINK.
Traders use the TD Sequential Indicator to predict potential trend reversals for tokens based on the closing prices of their 13 previous bars or candles.
Says Martinez,
“The TD Sequential presents a buy signal on the Chainlink weekly chart, indicating that LINK could experience an upswing lasting one to four weeks.”

At time of writing, LINK is trading at $13.43.

More Pain For Ethereum? Analyst Predicts "Washout" To $2,700 Amid Regulatory Pressure


								Ethereum remains under immense selling pressure, shaving over 30% from March 2024 highs. With prices recently dropping below $3,000 and sellers doubling down, there could be no reprieve for optimistic buyers in the sessions to come. 
Analyst Expects One More “Washout” To $2,700
Taking to X, one analyst notes that the coin is still bearish and moving inside a falling wedge. The trader predicts that ETH will continue dropping below immediate support levels. 
ETH remains bearish | Source: Analyst on X
In a post, the trader predicts a potential “washout” for ETH that would likely see the coin fall below $2,700. The analyst added that despite the prevailing fear, the overall structure of Ethereum price action remains unchanged. 

The Ethereum candlestick arrangement in the daily chart shows that Ethereum prices are within a bearish breakout formation. Following the sharp losses in mid-April, buyers have yet to unwind losses.

Accordingly, unless there is no strong push above $3,300 and the descending wedge, the odds of sellers further pressing on remain high. In the current formation, Ethereum has strong support at $2,800. If there is a “washout,” as the analyst says, ETH may fall below $2,700 towards $2,600 and $2,200, two of the immediate support levels.
Prospects Of Spot Ethereum ETFs Dimming
 
Adding fuel to the bearish fire are growing odds that the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) might reject the approval of spot Ethereum exchange-traded funds (ETFs) this month. This speculation stems from analysts pointing to the commission potentially classifying Ethereum as a security, derailing ETF approval.
A finance lawyer on X confirmed that the United States SEC is considering classifying ETH as a security in their upcoming spot ETF decisions. Unlike Bitcoin, whose spot and futures ETFs were approved without such scrutiny, ETH faces this additional hurdle. 

Should the Gary Gensler-led commission deem ETH security, dire consequences would exist. While all spot ETF applications could be denied, there would be more. As part of Grayscale’s Ethereum trusts, ETHE, terms and conditions, if the United States SEC classifies ETH as a security, all ETHE will be liquidated, and the trust closed. 
In late April, Consensys, led by Ethereum’s co-founder Joseph Lubin, said they are suing the United States SEC to protect the broader crypto ecosystem. By threatening to classify ETH as a security, ConsenSys said the regulator “would jeopardize the United States’ ability to use Ethereum and similar blockchain technology.”

Solana Dev Confesses to Stealing, Gambling Away Cypher User Funds - Decrypt

Cypher protocol contributor “Hoak” confessed to stealing nearly half a million dollars in community funds to feed a growing gambling habit in a public statement on Twitter on Tuesday.“I know likely nothing I say or do will make things better—perhaps other than rotting in jail,” the pseudonymous developer wrote. “To address the elephant in the room, the allegations are true, I took the funds and gambled them away. I didn’t run away with it, nor did anyone else.”According to figures shared by Cypher Protocol core contributor “Barrett,” the stolen funds included $314,674 in USDT, USDC, and Solana (SOL) that were sent to Binance by a wallet associated with Hoak. In addition, the same wallet amassed over $184,077 in ETH, RLB, ORCA, RAY, USDT, USDC,  BONK, JitoSOL, mSOL, and WSOL.Hoak’s public confession appears to have been triggered by a simmering investigation that began on the Cypher Protocol Discord server. Cypher Protocol is a cross-margin decentralized exchange on the Solana blockchain.“First and foremost I would like to deeply apologize to all affected parties, I know at this point nothing is going to take back my actions, and I have to face the consequences, [and] I am also in no way, shape, or form attempting to victimize myself,” Hoak wrote. “But this is the culmination of what snowballed into a crippling gambling addiction and probably multiple other psychological factors that went by unchecked for too long.”In the confession, Hoak said the situation that led to the Cypher Protocol theft dates back to an unexplained event at the first Solana Breakpoint conference in November 2021.“The victims were my brother and Max from Mango DAO,” Hoak wrote. “Coincidentally, what someone else did to me and my brother was the same thing I ended up doing to Max.”The October 2022 Mango Markets hack allowed thieves to make off with $100 million in funds.According to Hoak, after an unnamed previous project failed to get off the ground, he began working with Cypher Protocol, which offers access to margined spot and derivatives markets and borrowing and lending services.“I’d found my footing with Cypher,” he recalled. “These guys became family to me, I loved them and the mission we had, I worked and worked, I tried to innovate within the DEX design space, I failed, I worked some more, and I broke.”Cypher Protocol core contributor Barrett subsequently posted details of the theft on Twitter, including Hoak’s wallet address, alleging that the theft happened via 36 withdrawal transactions over months.“This is incredibly saddening to me,” Barrett wrote. “I never thought this would be a possibility, having a core contributor who stayed on after the [Mango] exploit to try and rebuild the project be the one who rugged funds from the redemption contract.”As Barrett explained, the theft was first detected when a member of the Cypher Protocol Discord server reported that they were unable to withdraw funds, which Hoak said he would resolve. However, the user reported they could not withdraw after the deadline Hoak provided.“I have reached out to law enforcement with the information in the below document,” Barrett said, posting a link to a Google Docs document containing extensive details about the theft.Taking to Twitter, Internet Sleuth ZachXBT said he knew Hoak, adding that he helped the Cypher Protocol team with an exploit in 2023. As a result of that collaboration, ZachXBT said he had Hoak’s personal information.When Decrypt inquired about whether ZachXBT intended to share that information with law enforcement, he replied, “As needed yes.”“I currently have no energy left whatsoever and considering no one is going to want anything to do with me after all this, I believe there’s no way forward, and it’s actually over for me,” Hoak wrote. “Whatever comes next is in God’s hands.”“I’m sorry I fucked up,” his Twitter thread concluded.Hoak and Barrett did not immediately respond to a request for comment from Decrypt.Edited by Ryan Ozawa.Stay on top of crypto news, get daily updates in your inbox.

Bitcoin Echoes 2016 Trends, Predictions Suggest Surge to $350,000 in Current Cycle



                    

Bitcoin‘s trajectory is mirroring its post-2016 halving event, with current analyses suggesting a potential local bottom and future peaks reaching up to $350,000 in this cycle, as observed by cryptocurrency traders.



Rekt Capital, a pseudonymous crypto trader, noted in a May 11 post on X (formerly Twitter) that Bitcoin’s pattern closely follows its 2016 behavior. 




“Bitcoin has repeated 2016 history perfectly, offering a downside wick below the bottom of its current re-accumulation range within a three-week window after the Halving,” Rekt Capital stated. 



At this stage in the cycle, the reaccumulation range is defined as any price under $61,081. Presently, Bitcoin’s trading price slightly lags this benchmark at $60,901, based on CoinMarketCap data.



Rekt also pointed out that Bitcoin is in the last “pre-halving retrace” phase, which in 2016 led to a significant 48% price increase six months later, reaching $973 by December 30.




Despite the current prices, Timothy Peterson, founder and investment manager at Cane Island Alternative Advisors, sees a promising outlook based on the price drawdown from the all-time high (ATH) chart. 



This chart tracks the decline from Bitcoin’s highest price point to its lowest within a certain period. 



Peterson stated, “Based on adoption and prior drawdowns, we can guesstimate that the peak value of this cycle would be between $175,000 – $350,000 in the next 9 months.” 



He anticipates the bull market concluding by January 2025.

Additionally, another indicator, the daily 100 moving average, is being closely watched by analysts. 



This average, which forecasts long-term Bitcoin price trends, is calculated by summing up the last 100 days’ prices and dividing by 100. 



According to Daan Crypto traders, this indicates that Bitcoin might be near its local bottom. 



In their May 11 post, they drew comparisons to a similar trend observed following the approval of 11 spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds in January. 



A subsequent 32% price rise to $51,730 by February 25 supported their analysis.



Daan Crypto traders concluded with a cautious optimism: “Support until it isn’t, but bulls need to put in some work.” 



This sentiment underscores the dynamic and speculative nature of Bitcoin’s market movements, hinging on both historical patterns and evolving market conditions.

                        Brazilian authorities have upheld a ban on the use of crypto donations to fund political parties and candidates’ electoral campaigns in the country.In a ruling published on its website, the nation’s electoral court (Tribunal Superior Eleitoral, or TSE for short) wrote that it would “maintain” an existing “ban on the use of donations made in cryptocurrency.”The TSE’s ruling covers the period up until the 2024 municipal elections. Polls are slated for October 6 this year. A run-off vote is scheduled for October 27.Blow to Community as Brazil Upholds Crypto Donations Ban
Brazilians go to the polls in October to vote for mayors, deputy mayors, and local councilors in over 5,500 regions.The new ruling effectively updates the existing regulations surrounding the funding of political campaigns. The TSE wrote:“The payment of electoral expenses with virtual currencies and pre-paid cards managed by third parties is prohibited.”The headquarters of the Brazilian electoral court. (Source: Senado Federal [CC BY 2.0])The TSE explained its reasons for upholding the ban, claiming its rules “aim to ensure transparency and the proper tracking of donations made to political campaigns.”It said the ruling was made “in accordance” with its “legal and accountability requirements.”The electoral regulator said that its updated rules would reinforce its “commitment to supervise the fairness of the electoral process.”It added that it would continue to “protect elections against irregular or illicit practices.”Banks Must Handle Political Donations, Says Regulator
The rules stipulate that donations to the value of just over $200 “must only be made by bank transfer,” and would be subject to cross-checking.“All” crypto donations, even contributions worth less than $200, remain banned. The TSE first explicitly banned crypto as a donations tool in December 2019.It has subsequently updated its guidelines on several occasions. In each case, it has explicitly banned crypto donations.Crypto community members had been hoping for a change, considering the phenomenal rate of adoption in Brazil and the wider LATAM region.Regulator Orders Candidates to Abide by Rules
The TSE also instructed all candidates to detail their expenses and donated income in mandatory financial statements.The body warned that those who fail to adhere to its rules could face censure from the Public Prosecutor’s Office and its own court system.Last month, Nubank, the country’s biggest neobank and the third-largest company in Brazil by market cap, announced it would begin allowing its customers to make Bitcoin and Ethereum withdrawals from its banking app.

Roaring Kitty/meme stock-themed meme coins were the top crypto gainers today / Source: Cryptonews
                        Trading conditions were broadly bearish on Tuesday as traders focused on a hotter-than-expected US PPI report and commentary from Fed Chair Jerome Powell, with traders having to turn to the on-chain meme coin markets in the hunt for top crypto gainers today.Bitcoin (BTC) and Ether (ETH) were both down around 2% in the past 24 hours, as per CoinMarketCap.Focus in the market has now mostly shifted to Wednesday’s release of US CPI and Retail Sales data.This could be a major market catalyst depending on how it impacts Fed rate cut bets.One reason why Bitcoin and Ether, last at $61,500 and $2,880 respectively, are down substantially from earlier yearly highs is that the US economy has remained hotter than expected this year.Traders will be hoping for evidence that the rise in price pressures seen in recent months is beginning to reverse.That could come as a relief to the market. But even if a bounce is incoming, major cryptos mostly remain tightly locked within recent ranges.Big moves are unlikely to come in anytime soon. The same can not be said for the highly illiquid on-chain crypto markets.Indeed, these markets were set alight this week by GameStop icon Roaring Kitty’s abrupt return.Meme coins in honour of the 2021 meme stock craze leader have been spring up left, right and center.Here are some top crypto gainers today as per Decentralized Exchange (DEX) analytics tool DEXScreener.Top Crypto Gainers TodayRoaring Kitty Wif Hat (RWIF)A recently launched Solana meme coin called Roaring Kitty Wif Hat (RWIF), a combination of popular meme coin dogwifhat and Roaring Kitty, is ripping higher since its launch.As per DEXScreener, it was last up 95,000% in the past 24 hours. RWIF now has a market cap of $2.7 million.Little more than 12 hours old, RWIF has 1,300 holders and over 250 Telegram members.Before getting too excited, traders should remember that nearly all newly launched coins are scams or pump-and-dumps. Hardly any end up having any long-term value.DUMB MONEY (DUMB)Another just launched Solana meme coin called DUMB MONEY (DUMB) is also pumping.As per DEXScreener, it was last up 36,000% in 24 hours with a market cap nearing $900,000.DUMB MONEY is likely a play on the joke that the retail investors behind the meme stock/meme coin pump are considered “dumb money”, as opposed to “smart money” hedge funds or institutional investors.https://twitter.com/Dumb_Money_Sol/status/1790428817539895663But the meme stock craze of 2021 is widely hailed as an instance when Dumb Money won.DUMB has just over $100,000 in locked liquidity, but could easily just be a pump-and-dump scheme.GameStop (GME)BNB traders are getting in on the action, with just launched meme coin named GameStop (GME).That is, of course, borrowing its name directly from the legendary meme stock.Up 8,900% in 24 hours as per DEXScreener, GME’s market cap was last $4.4 million.The token has close to $1 million in unlocked liquidity, with over 1,500 unique wallets having traded it.Again, traders must do their own due diligence and keep in mind that most newly issued tokens are scams.Better Alternative to Consider
Investing on newly launched meme coins is fraught with risk.Yes, some of these coins might 100x. But the vast majority will fall flat, and investors might never be able to find the liquidity to sell.Their fast price action tends to trigger FOMO in traders, who neglect to do the required due diligence.A potentially better alternative to investing in just-launched meme coins is to invest in presales.Here, traders have more time to research a project and see if it is a good fit for them.Indeed, if a trader can reliably identify projects that end up gaining tract, they can make big gains.Analysts at Cryptonews keep a close eye on the presale market. Here are some of their top presales for 2024.20 Best Crypto Presales to Invest In Now

How Far Can Roaring Kitty’s Return Really Carry GameStop? - Decrypt

We do the research, you get the alpha!Get exclusive reports and access to key insights on airdrops, NFTs, and more! Subscribe now to Alpha Reports and up your game!Go to Alpha ReportsMeme stock fever is back, with GameStop, AMC, and other companies from the 2021 hype cycle seeing surging share prices in recent days amid the apparent return of Roaring Kitty, a key figure behind the 2021 craze. But with the trader and influencer primarily posting rousing movie clips so far, how long will the hype sustain a meme stock revival?Roaring Kitty is the alias of Keith Gill, a financial advisor turned content creator and stock trader who commanded attention when he made enthusiastic bets on the price of GameStop shares in early 2021. The video game retailer’s share price sank over the previous few years as the firm struggled to adapt to industry changes.His livestreams and bullish Reddit posts under the name DeepFuckingValue helped inspire many other everyday traders to buy into GME, pushing the price from around $5 to a high of nearly $500 per share. A resulting short squeeze led to billions of dollars’ worth of losses for firms that were betting against GameStop’s revival, and caused broader market chaos.Roaring Kitty disappeared from social media in June 2021, months after testifying before Congress on the matter. But his Sunday tweet, showing a man holding a controller and snapping to attention, helped rile up a revival in trading for GameStop, movie theater chain AMC, and other meme stocks, along with meme cryptocurrencies as well.At a closing price of $48.75, GME shares are up nearly 203% over the past five days, while AMC is up 117% during the same span to $6.85. That’s huge. But both stocks lost considerable ground over the course of Tuesday’s trading, amid questions of whether Roaring Kitty plans to do more than just tweet out video clips.GME opened the day just below $65 per share before dipping nearly 25% by the close, while AMC had a sharper 42% dip from the $11.88 start to the close.Both stocks are ticking up after hours, however, and we saw a sizable jump from the end of business on Monday to the markets opening on Tuesday. Could it repeat again? Anything’s possible with meme stocks, just like meme coins. They’re famously volatile and often based on social media sentiment.But it’s unclear how much Roaring Kitty plans to increase his online presence—and whatever his plans, can it really drive another large-scale meme stock revival? Roaring Kitty has yet to resume his livestreams and Reddit bull-posting from 2021; so far, it’s just been a steady stream of tweets featuring meme-ified movie and music video clips.That’s been enough to pump GameStop and AMC shares, along with various meme coins. But if that’s all we get from Roaring Kitty, will this revival ultimately be more than a blip on the radar—a short-lived blast of nostalgia? Traders eagerly await the answer.Editor’s note: This article was written with the assistance of AI.

OKX Ventures Invests in Blade of God X, Introducing 'Play to Train' AI Feature in Blockchain-Powered RPG



                    

OKX Ventures, a Crypto and Web3 investment fund, recently backed the action role-playing game Blade of God X, developed by Void Labs. 



The game, which is still in early access, introduces a novel “play to train” feature. 




This feature enables gamers to influence the training of an artificial intelligence (AI) model through their gameplay. 



In a press release, OKX Ventures described this innovative concept as a fusion of “advanced AI agents with blockchain technology,” allowing players to directly train their AI agents as they play the game.



However, specifics about the AI models and the exact mechanisms by which gameplay aids in their training remain vague. 




Inquiries made by Cointelegraph to OKX Ventures and Void Labs regarding these details have not yet been answered.



Blade of God X aligns itself with the “Souls-like” genre, recognized for its intricate action sequences, and is currently available for download on the Epic Game Store. 



While the game itself is free, engaging with its blockchain components may necessitate payments or wallet interactions. 



These blockchain features include functionalities that integrate with Immutable X and Ethereum Virtual Machine chains, as noted in the Epic Games Store’s FAQ section.

Players interested in the game’s Web3 aspects can utilize tools like MetaMask, GameStop, Venly, Coinbase Wallet, Magic Link, or Immutable Passport to trade and customize their gaming experience.



According to the press release, the Blade of God series has amassed over six million downloads to date, with Blade of God X itself securing $6 million in funding. 



The game’s partnership network includes notable investors such as Delphi Ventures, BreederDAO, and Eden Holdings among others.



Tnise, the founder of Void Labs, expressed gratitude for the support from OKX Ventures, noting, “This partnership will provide us with the necessary resources and guidance to continue innovating, broaden our horizons and deliver exceptional gaming experiences to players worldwide.”



Blade of God X represents a blending of traditional gaming with the emerging technologies of AI and blockchain, offering players both a rich gaming experience and an opportunity to partake in the development of AI through interactive gameplay.

Cypher core contributor admits to stealing $260K and gambling it away

An anonymous core contributor to the Solana exchange Cypher Protocol has confessed to stealing and gambling away around $260,000 worth of the project’s cryptocurrency recovered from a $1 million exploit last year.“The allegations are true, I took the funds and gambled them away. I didn’t run away with it, nor did anyone else,” the contributor, who goes by “hoak” wrote in a public statement they shared in a May 14 X post.Anonymous Cypher contributor “Barrett” had earlier posted a document to X alleging that a wallet owned by hoak made 36 transactions withdrawing various amounts of Ether (ETH), Bonk (BONK), Wrapped Solana (wSOL) and other cryptocurrencies from Cypher’s redemption contract — totaling around $260,000.“I never thought this would be a possibility, having a core contributor who stayed on after the exploit to try and rebuild the project be the one who rugged funds from the redemption contract,” Barrett wrote on X.They added they notified law enforcement of hoak’s alleged actions.Source: BarrettIn hoak’s statement, they wrote that “likely nothing I say or do will make things better — perhaps other than rotting in jail.”Hoak said their actions were “the culmination of what snowballed into a crippling gambling addiction” along with “multiple other psychological factors that went by unchecked for too long.”They said after a string of personal and career issues they found footing with Cypher but claimed they failed “to innovate within the DEX design space.”Source: Hoak“I worked and worked,” hoak wrote. “I failed, I worked some more and I broke.”Related: WBTC thief returns $71 million worth of stolen fundsHoak said they “let too many things pile up in my head for too long, I let them consume me.”“I completely lost it late last year and earlier this year to the point where simply trying to hold it together was impacting everything else in my life, distancing myself from long-time friends, family, not being able to meet the deadlines I set for myself, having erratic behaviours, you name it,” they wrote.In August 2023, an exploiter pilfered Cypher Protocol for — at the time — $1 million worth of Solana (SOL) and USD Coin (USDC).The protocol managed to freeze $600,000 worth of the stolen crypto, it later created the redemption contract and a recovery plan to pay back users for their stolen funds.

Bitcoin Price Linked To Binance Vs Coinbase Battle, Quant Reveals


																A quant has explained how there appears to be a relationship between Coinbase’s spot volume dominance vs. Binance’s and the Bitcoin price.
Bitcoin Has Been Reacting To Binance/Coinbase Volume Changes
In a CryptoQuant Quicktake post, an analyst discussed the dynamics in the cryptocurrency market that arise out of the battle happening between Binance and Coinbase for spot volume dominance.

	Related Reading



The quant shared a chart below that shows how this war for dominance has played out over the past decade.
The spot volume share of the two giant exchanges | Source: CryptoQuant
As the graph shows, Binance has been the much more dominant of the two platforms when considering the spot volume. The exchange is hosting five times as much volume as Coinbase.
The analyst notes that the difference between the two would be even higher when considering the BTC-FDUSD pair, which isn’t included in the data depicted in the above chart.
Despite the much lower spot volume, Coinbase still hasn’t been irrelevant in the market. For example, the platform is the custodian for Bitcoin spot exchange-traded funds (ETFs) like BlackRock’s IBIT and Grayscale’s GBTC.
There also appears to be an interesting pattern between the dominance of the American exchange and the Bitcoin spot price. The quant has highlighted this trend in the graph.
There have been a few instances where a rise in the spot trading volume of Coinbase against Binance has preceded surges in the value of cryptocurrency. Similarly, declines in the platform’s dominance have seemingly led to drawdowns in the Bitcoin price.
The analyst has also discussed the trend in the volumes of the two exchanges more closely, using the spot volume ratio for them, as shown below.
The value of the metric seems to have been relatively low in recent months | Source: CryptoQuant
The chart shows that the spot volume ratio between Binance and Coinbase had spiked to very high levels in 2023, with the former’s volume being 53 times the latter’s. The reason behind this was the zero-fee scheme that Binance had introduced for the Bitcoin trading pairs.
However, Coinbase’s volume has recently risen, although the ratio remains notably in favor of Binance. This shift in the market emerged as the Bitcoin spot ETF-related news started to intensify.

The quant concludes:


The dynamics between these exchanges are complex, but the graphs show that each exchange’s dominance at specific times has a direct impact on the price of Bitcoin. It’s a true battle between the market’s biggest players, where competition is constant, and the outcome is reflected in cryptocurrency movements.

At the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading at around $61,800, down 3% over the past week.

Shiba Inu (SHIB) Token Holder Swaps $23000 Into Mollars ICO - DCA’ing, King Shrimp Passed Whales


                        
                            Shiba Inu (SHIB) Token Holder Swaps $23000 Into Mollars ICO — DCA’ing, King Shrimp Passed Whales                        
                        

                         A crypto shrimp, perhaps better called the King shrimp, who was earlier tracked by Crypto.News has upped the holdings of his Mollars token presale ‘bag.’   Buying frequently or dollar cost averaging into the presale,  the traders frequent buys have made them what’s believed to be the biggest holder of Ethereum blockchain’s coming store-of-value token.The buyer’s wallet transaction address is public [see here] and was last active 11 days ago.Investor has a successful track record with Memecoins
The trader appears to be savvy in memecoin ICO investing as they have transactions with Shiba Inu (SHIB), Volt Inu (VOLT), and Robo Inu (ROBO).  The regular purchases of Mollars tops all other investments this year, but this holder is believed to be a major holder of Shiba Inu tokens.    Possibly a holder from the SHIB token’s golden era.Investments in the Mollars token presale would not have caught the eye of anyone watching the presale’s transaction addresses.   The biggest single purchase by this ‘King Shrimp’ was for 1.06 ETH, which is far from the biggest single buy from an investor.  However,  when making 12 purchases of such a magnitude,  the numbers add up quickly.DCA: Made 12 Mollars Token Presale PurchasesThe total value of the 12 purchases, in Ethereum coin, is 7.974272038 ETH.  The purchase has a value of roughly $23080.73 at the time of writing this article.The amount of Mollars tokens purchased with this $23K investment is estimated to be around 57,700.  Investments are believed to be made between 1st and 3rd round of the ICO, averaging around $0.40 [cents] per token.Mollars token is already slated to be listed on at least 2 crypto exchanges on or around June 1st — Bitmart and LBank.  If the Initial Coin Offering reaches its max hard cap, the listing day price of the token will be $0.62 [cents] per token.How Listing Day Could Yield Investor $12.6k Profit
The listing day of 62-cents means this ‘King Shrimp’ will see their investment rise in value from $23,080.70 to $35,775.09 on June 2nd,  if hard cap’s met.The value of the token is projected to continue to rise from there however, with some token predictions suggesting the $MOLLARS token could reach ~$15 [dollars] before the year’s end; higher possible if popularity continues growing at a similar pace as today, after listing day.The “King Shrimp” appears to have made a valuable decision with a $12695 profit close to materializing.The hard cap of the Mollars ICO is 4-million tokens.  The total token supply of the cryptocurrency, ever to be minted, is 10-million tokens.   Just 40% of the total token supply for the cryptocurrency was designated for the presale, from which much will be used to fund the project’s development and critical growth in branding value.Investor Choosing SHIB Signals Higher Expectations For MollarsThe “King Shrimp” appears to be migrating a sizable amount of his funds from Shiba Inu to Mollars.  This is  possibly a signal that the veteran investor believes the $MOLLARS token will see a substantially higher growth than $SHIB in 2024.Mollars token presale has raised $1.31-million-dollars in funding thus far.   This holder with $23,000 is believed to be the biggest holder of the new store-of-value token pre-listing.For the year, Shiba Inu token has yielded investors a +168% gain but most holders are still under water [losing] in 2024.The last months’ gains were only +6.6%, which  is less than the expected listing day yields for Mollars.   Migratory traders see the writing on the wall for the new store-of-value token, set to rival Bitcoin;  It’s likely going to produce far more gains than Shiba Inu (SHIB) any time soon.

Bitcoin will stay in $55K to $75K zone for now: Novogratz

Bitcoin’s (BTC) price will continue to range between $55,000 and $75,000 over the next month, potentially bouncing higher toward the end of Q2, according to Mike Novogratz, the founder and CEO of Galaxy Digital. Speaking on Galaxy Digital’s Q1 earnings call, during which the firm reported record quarterly revenue, Novogratz said crypto markets are currently in a “consolidation phase” and predicted that prices will bounce higher towards the end of the current quarter. “Bitcoin, Ethereum, and everything else, Solana will consolidate. What does that mean? It means probably somewhere between 55 and 75 until the next set of circumstances, the next set of market events brings us higher,” he said. Spot Bitcoin ETFs initially debuted with ravenous demand from institutional investors — generating more than $13.9 billion in volume in their first work — but inflows have waned significantly in recent months amid a wider tumble in price for the underlying asset.According to TradingView data, Bitcoin is down 16.5% from its new all-time high of $73,700, which it notched on March 13. Bitcoin remains up 45.7% from the start of the year. Source: TradingViewNovogratz said he wasn’t too worried by the dwindling inflows for spot Bitcoin ETFs nor did he seem concerned by Bitcoin’s recent downward slide, noting a broader trend of adoption among traditional financial institutions. Galaxy Digital and pattern firm Invesco, issue their own spot Bitcoin ETF which sports the ticker BTCO. Since inception, the fund has attracted just $268 million in inflows — the second lowest total inflows of all funds excluding Grayscale Bitcoin Trust. “We continue to see adoption growing [...] big players are just now starting to put it through their system,” he said. “That whole process of wealth managers selling it to their clients isn’t an overnight process.”Related: Novogratz’s Galaxy Digital raising $100M to fund crypto startups: ReportNotably, Novogratz said many of the tailwinds that drove price action at the start of this year will continue to stick around for the next few months and looked to several catalysts for crypto market price action moving forward. He said crypto asset prices could begin to pick up when the United States Federal Reserve eventually begins cutting rates “because the economy finally slows” or alternatively we see a favorable outcome from the upcoming U.S. presidential election.“We get through the election and I think the election will bring clarity, one way or the other, to the crypto regulatory landscape,” Novogratz said. Galaxy Digital posted a net income of $421.7 million for the first quarter, climbing 40% from the last quarter of 2023. Income was buoyed by record revenue from mining operations and management fees.Web3 Gamer: Web3 gaming won’t exist in 5 years, $656K for best crypto game pitch

Wisconsin Invests $99 Million in BlackRock Bitcoin ETF


The State of Wisconsin Investment Board (SWIB) has made a significant move in the cryptocurrency market by purchasing $99 million worth of BlackRock’s Bitcoin ETFs, iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT). 
This acquisition, disclosed in a recent filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), highlights the growing trend of institutional investment in Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs).
Wisconsin’s Strategic Move
The financial markets have been buzzing since spot Bitcoin ETFs were approved in January. These investment vehicles have quickly gained traction among institutional investors. For instance, notable financial entities such as Wells Fargo and JPMorgan have already disclosed their holdings in Bitcoin ETFs.

SWIB, responsible for managing assets within various state trust funds, including the Wisconsin Retirement System and the State Investment Fund, now has strategically positioned itself in the growing ETF market. By investing nearly $100 million in BlackRock’s offering, Wisconsin joins a growing list of institutional investors betting on the future of crypto.

“Normally you don’t get these big fish institutions in the 13Fs for a year or so (when the ETF gets more liquidity) but as we’ve seen these are no ordinary launches. Good sign, expect more, as institutions tend to move in herds,” Bloomberg Senior ETF Analyst Eric Balchunas said.


The investments towards these new financial vehicles show no signs of slowing down. Over the last 24 hours, nearly $66 million in net inflows were recorded, bringing the total inflows to almost $11.75 billion. Among the notable gainers were FBTC, which received $39 million in inflows; BITB, which received $20 million; and HODL, which received $7 million.

Other financial giants have similarly ramped up their investments. Bracebridge Capital has invested $363 million in spot Bitcoin ETFs, while Bank of Montreal has also disclosed owning Bitcoin ETFs in a recent SEC filing. Additionally, UBS Group AG, a Switzerland-based investment bank, invested $145,692 in IBIT.
The influx of institutional investments into its ETFs signifies a pivotal shift in the financial sector. It points to a growing acceptance of cryptocurrencies as a legitimate asset class, paving the way for broader adoption and integration of digital assets into mainstream finance.

Why Floki Inu Wants to Burn 15.2 Billion Tokens


The Floki Inu community proposed to burn 15,246,000,000 FLOKI, which are currently worth $2.8 million.
The community explained that these actions intend to remove the tokens from blacklisted wallets.
15.2 Billion FLOKI Burn
Floki Inu detailed that the burning of 15,246,000,000 FLOKI is supported by a 2022 vote, where the community agreed to burn the excess recovered tokens. The community has emphasized that when wallets are blacklisted, nothing can be done with the tokens apart from sending them to the Floki multisig. 
In other words, the community sees it as right to remove these tokens from the market permanently.


“As such, we feel it is only fair to burn the returned token to permanently remove it from circulation, in line with the expectations the community has about these tokens,” Floki Inu community explained.

Floki DAO even promised those who voted to send 1% of the value of the returned tokens, around 154 million FLOKI, to those affected as a “goodwill gesture.” This could encourage more wallets to send their excess tokens to burn. Regardless, the proposal has received 232 votes. 
It is not the first time the community has voted to burn FLOKI tokens. In February, they voted to burn 190.9 billion tokens recovered from the multi-chain bridge.

“In each of these cases, the decision of the Floki DAO was swiftly executed, making it clear that Floki is a completely decentralized cryptocurrency and the Floki DAO ultimately determines the direction of the project,” the Floki Inu community said.

Following the announcement, FLOKI rose more than 11%, going from $0.0001872 to $0.0002025. Meanwhile, its trading volume rose 235.29% in the last 24 hours.

Investors Buy $4.2 Billion in Bitcoin Before US Inflation Data


In anticipation of the upcoming US inflation report, savvy investors have purchased 70,000 Bitcoin (BTC), signaling a strategic pivot towards cryptocurrency as a hedge against potential economic volatility. 
This massive acquisition follows a significant 1 million BTC sell-off at the close of 2023, underscoring renewed confidence among long-term holders in BTC’s value.
Investors Return to Buy 70,000 BTC Ahead of CPI Report 
Recent worries about inflation and the decreasing worth of fiat currencies have sparked renewed interest in alternative stores of value. 
Indeed, on-chain data from Glassnode reveals investors are strategically accumulating more Bitcoin. Their actions suggest a belief in BTC’s enduring value, particularly as it stabilizes above $60,000.

The US Consumer Price Index (CPI) rose 0.4% in March and reached 3.5% over the past year. This number remains historically high and has significantly changed the value of a dollar compared to a decade ago when the inflation rate was just 0.8%. 
The upcoming US inflation report on May 15 also has investors on edge as the Federal Reserve remains unlikely to cut rates this year. For this reason, Neil Bergquist, CEO of Coinme, emphasizes Bitcoin’s appeal as a store of value. 
He points out that, unlike bank-held dollars, Bitcoin’s capped supply of 21 million BTC presents an inflation-resistant alternative. 


“There’ll never be more than 21 million bitcoin ever. It has a fixed supply, unlike fiat currencies, and no one can change that. No one can come in with a new policy, no one can get elected with a new idea and change that. It’s hard-coded into the bitcoin blockchain,” Bergquist explained.

Core inflation, which excludes the more volatile costs of food and gas, will likely remain persistently high due to increased costs of shelter and core services such as insurance and medical care. According to Bank of America, higher energy prices, driven by increased gas prices, are expected to contribute to a “relatively firmer headline CPI print.”
As a result, Bitcoin may be able to establish itself as a decentralized resource, solidifying its standing as a hedge to traditional financial systems. 

“If you hold dollars in your bank account over a period of rising inflation, then your balance has less purchasing power than if you were to store your value in Bitcoin,” Bergquist concluded.

Bitcoin miners start to sell: Will BTC crash again, sooner than you think? - AMBCrypto



Bitcoin miners might sell as decreased mining rewards and transaction fees lower revenues.
A potential sell-off by miners could dramatically impact the cryptocurrency market.

Bitcoin [BTC] continues to hold significant value, trading above $60,000 despite a 2.3% decrease over the past day. 
This resilience in price comes amid a challenging period for Bitcoin miners, whose revenues have plummeted following the most recent halving event, according to data from Kaiko.
Pressures on Bitcoin miners intensify
Bitcoin miners are facing increasing pressure to sell their holdings as a result of diminishing revenues.
 The recent halving, which reduced mining rewards from 6.25 BTC to 3.125 BTC, has significantly impacted their income. 
This drop in revenue is compounded by falling transaction fees, which have not recovered since the initial surge following the halving.
Source: Kaiko
Kaiko’s report highlights that miners’ dual income streams—mining rewards and transaction fees—are yielding lower returns. 
This is forcing miners to consider offloading their BTC to cover operational costs. Kaiko analysts noted, 
“The halving has typically been a selling event for Bitcoin miners as the process of creating new blocks incurs significant costs, forcing miners to sell to cover costs.”
Source: Kaiko
The potential for a Bitcoin sell-off by miners could have profound effects on the cryptocurrency market, especially given the current low liquidity. 
Mining giants like Marathon Digital, which holds over $1.1 billion in Bitcoin, could trigger significant market movements if they decide to sell even a small portion of their holdings.
Kaiko’s report explains.
“Bitcoin miners typically classify their BTC holdings as current assets due to their ability to liquidate these holdings to fund operating expenses.”
 With major players like Marathon Digital and Riot Platforms holding substantial amounts of Bitcoin, any forced sales could lead to notable market impacts.
Bitcoin’s network activity declines
Meanwhile, Bitcoin’s network activity is showing signs of slowing down. 
Glassnode’s data reveals that the number of active Bitcoin addresses (7d EMA)  has fallen from over 800,000 to below 700,000 in recent weeks. 
Source: Glassnode
Similarly, the number of new addresses (7d EMA) has decreased from around 388,158 to 267,925, indicating a possible decline in user engagement and interest.
Source: Glassnode
Short-term technical analysis suggested that Bitcoin took out liquidity on the 30-minute chart on the 14th of May. 
This suggested that the asset might continue to retract towards the $60,000 range—a swing low—before any significant upward movement occurs.

The potential decline, coupled with pressures on miners, could set the stage for a volatile period in the Bitcoin market.

Meanwhile, AMBCrytpo has recently reported that crypto analyst Ali Martinez has projected that if Bitcoin can reclaim $64,290 as a support level, there could be a pathway to a bullish rise toward $76,610.

The NTS and its regional affiliates have been cracking down on tax dodgers who use crypto investments to hide their income in recent years.These crackdowns have yielded great success for the NTS and local tax bodies. They have seized and forcibly liquidated coins belonging to thousands of crypto holders nationwide.The NTS showcased its results over the past five years, explaining it had enacted “forced collections” for “641 high-value and habitual delinquents.”A National Tax Service office in Seoul.The tax body said that, as of 2021, it had frozen over $79 million worth of coins from tax dodgers.These tax dodgers have since paid the NTS over $69 million in fines and outstanding tax bills to unfreeze their tokens.The NTS said that it has “directly” sold $800,000 worth of coins from people who failed to pay their fines and outstanding bills.That would suggest that the tax body is currently holding coins worth over $9 million. Should tax evaders fail to pay their bills, the NTS would likely liquidate the entire $9 million.Yang Dong-hoon, the head of the NTS’ Tax Collection and Legal Department, said:“The National Tax Service will achieve tax justice.

UK Crypto Firm Shut Down After £5M Losses In Investors Money


								The UK government’s Insolvency Service has shut down a crypto advisory firm for accounting negligence and the loss of investors’ money. The firm seemingly claimed to help users with investments while promoting crypto schemes that resulted in millions lost.

False Crypto Expert Company Shut Down
On Monday, The UK’s government published a press release unveiling a web of lies weaved by Amey Finance Academy Ltd. Amey Finance was “an established and successful independent consultancy providing a plethora of financial services.”
The crypto advice company claimed to run an “industry-leading education academy” that guides customers through investment opportunities and teaches them about crypto.
Instead, the company promoted scheme projects, resulting in the loss of investors’ money. On April 30, the UK’s Insolvency Services obtained a winding-up order from the High Court in London.
In 2018, Desmond Amey created Amey Finance Academy to “offer financial advice and education on cryptocurrencies.” Amey was the London-based company’s sole director and shareholder and considered himself a “wealth creation expert.”
The director assured customers that their crypto investments “were solid.” However, investors informed authorities that they lost money in the opportunities offered by the firm.
Despite claiming to have the required licensing from the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA), it was revealed that the company was operating without authorization. In 2022, the FCA informed investors that Amey Finance Academy offered financial services and products as an unregistered company.
According to Mark George, the Insolvency Service’s Chief Investigator, Amey used the company “to recklessly persuade individuals to invest in cryptocurrency schemes and mislead them about the risks of doing so.”
The Chief Investigator revealed that the firm failed to deliver up-to-date accounts during the investigation. As a result, the Insolvency Services couldn’t establish the full extent of Amey Finance’s activities.
Despite the lack of transparency, the agency determined that at least £5 million passed through the company’s bank accounts between 2019 and 2022:

The failure to deliver adequate accounting records and a general lack of transparency shown has prevented the Insolvency Service from establishing the true extent of the company’s activities, its assets and liabilities, or the use of £5 million which passed through the company’s bank account between October 2019 and March 2022.

‘Trust Me Bro’ Director Promotes Schemes
According to the press release, Amey misrepresented the investment opportunities he offered. He assured customers their investments would not “drop below 90%” before losing all their money.
The investigation revealed that Amey Finance promoted crypto schemes run by other companies. Among these schemes, the firm endorsed companies like HyperFund, which raised $1.7 billion worldwide.
HyperFund raised the alarm of regulatory entities in the UK and New Zealand, who issued customer warnings against the company. The US Securities and Exchange Commission investigated the company, ultimately charging its founder with fraud in January 2024.
The director’s contradictory statements prevent Insolvency Services from unveiling the true relationship between Amey Finance and HyperFund. However, Amey claimed he only used his firm’s bank account to “help people buy cryptocurrency via a separate company called Bleuguava.”
During the investigation, the Insolvency Services had access to some messages from the director. Amey had told customers that the crypto investments were “100 certy” and asked investors to “trust me bro.”
Further investigations showed that the director’s email signature stated he was the Managing Director of Amey Commercial Finance Ltd, a company dissolved in 2017. In 2023, he had been evicted from the company’s address in London despite claiming to still have a presence there.
Ultimately, Amey’s web of lies resulted in the loss of millions for the investors and his company’s shutdown and future liquidation.

Layer-3 network Degen Chain hasn’t produced a block in 53 hours

Ethereum layer 3 blockchain Degen Chain has failed to validate a transaction or produce a new block in over 53 hours rendering the network and its applications completely unusable. Degen Chain stalled at 8:15 pm UTC on May 12 — the last time the network produced a new block, according to its block explorer.It is one of a few layer 3 blockchains that settle transactions on a layer-2 network. It uses the Ethereum layer 2 chain Base for settlement and the AnyTrust protocol for data availability functions.Degen Chain hasn’t produced a new block in over 50 hours. Source: Degen ChainIn a May 14 X post, the official Degen Chain account said it was working to resolve the downtime alongside its development partner — rollup infrastructure platform Conduit. Conduit said the downtime could be traced back to an issue stemming from a “custom config change” that saw Degen Chain and gaming network Apex stop block production.

Shiba Inu’s Adoption Soars: Meme Coin Now Accepted at Major Retailers with CoinGate Integration | Cryptoglobe


                                
The popular meme-inspired cryptocurrency Shiba Inu ($SHIB) has recently taken a new step towards broader adoption after its integration with CoinGate, a Lithuanian blockchain payment processor, added support for it on Polygon and the BNB Chain.



According to a post from CoinGate on social media, the meme-inspired cryptocurrency can now be used as a payment method at major retailers including Steam, Nike, Spotify, and Airbnb.







CoinGate acts as a bridge between the cryptocurrency world and traditional finance. By integrating SHIB with Polygon and BNB Chain, CoinGate facilitates transactions using SHIB for everyday purchases.



The news comes at a time in which the price of the meme-inspired cryptocurrency has been surging, with SHIB moving up over 10.5% over the last 30 days and more than 120% year-to-date.







            
            

            
            

            
            

        

Notably, earlier this month a major anonymous Shiba Inu whale wallet executed a series of large transactions on the popular Robinhood exchange, accumulating a staggering 1.75 trillion $SHIB tokens, valued at roughly $40 million.



The whale’s accumulation was first spotted by whale monitoring service Whale Alert, which pointed on the microblogging platform X (formerly known as Twitter) to two massive SHIB transactions off of Robinhood’s wallets to unknown wallets. Both transactions were of 875 billion SHIB, worth nearly $20 million.



This whale activity coincides with a potential bullish signal for SHIB. According to a recent post by Ali Martinez, a prominent cryptocurrency trader, Shiba Inu’s daily chart appears to be forming a “bull flag,” a technical indicator suggesting an imminent price surge.







Anticipating this breakout, Martinez revealed plans to place buy orders around the $0.000018343 mark, aiming to capitalize on a potential rise in SHIB’s price.

Is The Crypto Market Headed For A $100 Trillion Boom? This Expert Thinks So


								Raoul Pal, a well-known figure in the financial sector, provided a striking forecast for the future of cryptocurrencies.
His analysis suggests a potential rise in the market’s total capitalization to $100 trillion, spurred by global liquidity trends and technological adoption.
The Mechanics Behind The Prediction
Pal’s insights are rooted in his observation of the global liquidity cycle, which has been shaping macroeconomic trends since 2008. He notes that this cycle has played a crucial role in driving asset growth, particularly in the technology and crypto sectors.

In addition, Pal noted that the depreciation of fiat currencies, necessitated by the need to service growing global debt, is pushing asset prices higher.
This, combined with the rapid adoption rate of cryptocurrencies—reminiscent of the internet’s exponential growth—sets the stage for a monumental increase in market capitalization.

Pal’s view is supported by Chris Burniske, the former head of cryptocurrencies at ARK Invest, who concurs with the bullish outlook. Burniske envisions the digital currency market reaching $10 trillion soon and potentially soaring to $100 trillion.
Broader Crypto Market Perspectives
This optimistic forecast is not isolated. Brad Garlinghouse, CEO of Ripple, also projected significant growth for the crypto market, predicting it could reach $5 trillion by the end of 2024.
Garlinghouse’s comments, made in interviews with CNBC and Fox, emphasize the influence of macroeconomic factors like spot ETFs in attracting institutional money into the market. He suggested that decreasing supply and increasing demand could even mean his prediction might be conservative.
Further supporting the bullish sentiment, Bernstein, a financial services firm, issued an “outperform” rating on Robinhood, anticipating a near tripling of its cryptocurrency revenue by 2025.
In doing that. Bernstein’s analysis predicts the total market value of cryptocurrencies could hit $7.5 trillion by 2025, driven by a massive market expansion.
Despite these optimistic projections, the cryptocurrency market currently stands at $2.36 trillion, experiencing a slight downturn of 1.5% over the past 24 hours.

This decline is mirrored in the performances of Bitcoin and Ethereum, which saw reductions of 1.8% and 2.1%, respectively.
Notably, Dan Tapiero, the cofounder of Gold Bullion International and 10T Holdings, has recently expressed an extremely positive outlook on Bitcoin’s future based on current chart patterns.

In a recent tweet, Tapiero highlighted two charts that indicate a very promising trend for Bitcoin. He predicts that the leading crypto will soon surpass the $65,000 mark, followed by a climb to $90,000, with the potential for even further gains.

Signs of an altcoin season - Why we aren't in one yet? - AMBCrypto



Altcoins have performed well in a six-month window, but it does not signal an altcoin season.
The Bitcoin dominance chart could see accelerated gains for altcoin market capitalization.

Bitcoin [BTC] could not shake off its halving blues even though nearly a month had elapsed since the event. Market participants eagerly await a bull run, for both BTC and altcoins.
The altcoin season started in September 2023 and saw a pullback in the past six weeks.
There is plenty more in store for altcoins, but they have already witnessed a decent return in that six-month window. How crazy could the altcoin season get once Bitcoin is well on its way to this cycle’s top?
Replicating the past cycle’s performance
Source: TOTAL3 on TradingView
During the 2020 cycle, the altcoin market capitalization went from $51.2 billion in May 2020 to $1.13 trillion in November 2021.
This was a 21.6x gain, and a similar result during this cycle could put the market cap at $6 trillion.
That sounds like a mind-blowing number compared to $640 billion at press time, but crypto cycles do have a way of ripping up expectations.
Even though altcoins have performed well in recent months, they have competed with Bitcoin for a share of the capital inflows.
This could change once investors are willing to embrace more risk, confident of extended crypto gains, and look to expand their altcoin holdings.
Bitcoin dominance might hold the key
Source: BTC.D on TradingView
The altcoin winds might become dramatically more bullish once the Bitcoin dominance begins to shed. This chart maps what percentage of the total crypto market capitalization Bitcoin has captured.
Once it begins an earnest downtrend, it would indicate participants were more eager to buy altcoins than Bitcoin.
In the past 13 months, Bitcoin’s dominance has slowly climbed higher. This is typical of bear markets and persists till late into the bull run.
The few months when this metric is in a free fall is when the altcoin season truly begins.

Read Ethereum’s [ETH] Price Prediction 2024-2025

Comparing the altcoin market cap chart with the BTC.D chart, we can see that the greatest altcoin gains were made once Bitcoin dominance was in a downtrend.
Therefore, market participants waiting for an altcoin season this cycle could watch out for a fall in Bitcoin’s dominance.

Bitcoin ETFs see surging interest: Who's buying and who's selling? - AMBCrypto



U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs see net inflows, signaling growing confidence.
Hong Kong ETFs experience outflows, U.S. spot Bitcoin ETF trading volume declines globally.

Today marks a significant moment for Bitcoin [BTC] enthusiasts, as U.S. spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) have returned to net inflows.
After four consecutive weeks of outflows, the total inflows reached $116.8 million last week. This resurgence in investor confidence comes amidst a 1.98% price dip in the leading cryptocurrency over the past 24 hours.
Increased investor interest 
Despite the price uncertainty, there’s a notable uptick in investor interest, as evidenced by recent developments. Bracebridge Capital disclosed a $363 million investment in spot Bitcoin ETFs via an SEC filing.
Moreover, J.P. Morgan’s clients also recently invested $731,246 in spot Bitcoin ETFs, as revealed on the 14th of May.
Additionally, U.S. banking giant Wells Fargo entered the fray, holding 2,245 shares of GBTC valued at $121,207, and the list goes on.
Drawing insight on the same, Eric Balchunas, senior ETF analyst for Bloomberg, took to X (formerly Twitter) and noted,

Furthermore, BlackRock’s Bitcoin ETF, the iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT), has reached a significant milestone, surpassing its competitors in corporate holder count.
Since its inception till date, the BlackRock Bitcoin ETF has attracted 250 corporate holders.
Amidst the burgeoning investor interest, discussions have been widespread within the cryptocurrency community.

“They FUD #crypto in public and buy in private.”
On similar lines, @Vivek4real_ added,
“We are entering a new era.”

According to the on-chain metric analysis The Block, Grayscale’s Bitcoin Trust saw $171.1 million outflows last week, contrasting with $63 million inflows on the 3rd of May.
Fidelity’s FBTC led with $111.3 million inflows, followed by ARKB with $82.8 million. BlackRock’s IBIT had $48.1 million in inflows, marking a slowdown from peak inflows in March.
Hold your horses 
However, amidst such massive inflows, strangely Hong Kong ETFs experienced significant outflows on the 13th of May.
Data from Farside Investors indicates that spot bitcoin ETFs offered by ChinaAMC, Harvest Global, Bosera, and Hashkey collectively saw outflows totaling $32.7 million.
Source: Farside Investors
Additionally, despite a reversal in flows, trading volume for U.S. spot bitcoin ETFs declined to $7.4 billion last week, compared to the previous week’s $11 billion, as reported by The Block’s data dashboard.
Source: The Block
This decrease in volume was also reflected in the global crypto exchange-traded product market, which fell to $8 billion from an April weekly average of $17 billion.
Lastly, daily trading volume notably declined after hitting a record high of $9.9 billion on March 5, coinciding with bitcoin’s surge past its previous cycle peak of around $69,000.
Thus, as things evolve, the question remains unanswered — Could the increased institutional investment in Bitcoin ETFs reshape how people enter Bitcoin?

Ethereum Price Anticipates Upside Break To Shift Sentiment Towards Bullish


																Ethereum price is eyeing an upside break above the $2,900 level. ETH must settle above $2,900 and $2,940 to continue higher in the near term.

Ethereum is forming a base above the $2,860 support zone.
The price is trading below $2,950 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average.
There is a key bearish trend line forming with resistance at $2,905 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD (data feed via Kraken).
The pair could start a decent increase if there is a close above the $2,940 and $2,950 resistance levels.

Ethereum Price Eyes Fresh Increase
Ethereum price struggled to settle above the $3,000 level and started another decline, like Bitcoin. ETH traded below the $2,950 and $2,940 support levels.
The price even traded below $2,900. However, the bulls were again active near the $2,860 support zone. A low was formed at $2,860 and the price is now consolidating losses. It is slowly moving higher above the $2,885 level.
Ethereum is now trading below $2,950 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. Immediate resistance is near the $2,900 level. There is also a key bearish trend line forming with resistance at $2,905 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD. The trend line is close to the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the recent decline from the $2,992 swing high to the $2,860 low.
An upside break above the trend line might send the price toward the $2,925 level and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. The first major resistance is near the $2,940 level or the 61.8% Fib retracement level of the recent decline from the $2,992 swing high to the $2,860 low.

The next key resistance sits at $2,950, above which the price might gain traction and rise toward the $3,000 level. If there is a clear move above the $3,000 level, the price might rise and test the $3,050 resistance. Any more gains could send Ether toward the $3,150 resistance zone.
Another Drop In ETH?
If Ethereum fails to clear the $2,925 resistance, it could start another decline. Initial support on the downside is near the $2,880 level.
The first major support is near the $2,860 zone. The next support is near the $2,810 level. A clear move below the $2,810 support might push the price toward $2,740. Any more losses might send the price toward the $2,650 level in the near term.

                        BlackRock’s former global head of iShares and index investments, Salim Ramji, is joining Vanguard as its new CEO and board of directors from July 8.In an announcement, Vanguard said Ramji will take over from the current CEO Tim Buckley, who announced he would retire and step down from the firm in February this year.Ramji departed from his position at BlackRock in January 2024 where he was responsible for managing the majority of the firm’s client assets and overseeing the iShares platform. He joined BlackRock over a decade ago and under his tenure, the asset management firm launched the first spot Bitcoin exchange-traded fund for retail investors.Vanguard is the second largest asset management firm after BlackRock.BlackRock’s Spot Bitcoin ETF ‘IBIT’
Commenting on Ramji’s appointment, Bloomberg Intelligence senior ETF analyst Eric Balchunas said the former BlackRock executive oversaw the filing and logistics of the IBIT ETF and he is known to have an interest in the digital assets space. Vanguard on the other hand is anti-crypto.Before joining BlackRock Ramji held the position of senior partner at McKinsey and was responsible for the firm’s asset and wealth management practice. Ramji started his career as a lawyer at Clifford Chance in London and Hong Kong.“He [Ramji] cares about advancing the interests of individual investors, has a strong fiduciary ethos, and thinks strategically about solutions,” said Buckley, in a press release.  “Salim understands our organization’s deep sense of purpose and commitment to put clients first, which is a hallmark of Vanguard’s leadership team and culture,” added Buckley.“The current investor landscape is changing, and that presents opportunities for Vanguard to further its mission of giving people the best chance for investment success, which is more relevant today than at any time in the firm’s five-decade history,” said Ramji.Vanguard’s Anti Crypto Stance 
In January, Vanguard said it had no immediate plans to add spot Bitcoin ETF to its platforms despite the introduction of such ETFs generating headlines and buzz in the industry.“Given the current state of crypto as an asset class, Vanguard does not have plans to launch its own bitcoin ETF or any crypto-related products. When deciding what investment products to offer, we consider a range of factors, including whether we believe they have enduring investment merit and meet our client’s needs,” wrote Janel Jackson, Vanguard’s head of ETF Capital Markets and Broker and Index Relations in a note.“While the discussion about bitcoin and cryptocurrencies, in general, has increased recently, we do not currently believe that there is an appropriate role for them to play in long-term portfolios,” adds Jackson.

The Gaming Revolution - Why On-Chain Purchases Are the Future - The Daily Hodl


								
 
‘Fortnite’ skins and PokéCoins may not seem more like a fun gimmick than an in-game necessity, but these kinds of in-game purchases make up an enormous $70 billion-plus market.
In-game purchases have been around for a minute. The first microtransaction sold by a major publisher was in 2006 when Bethesda sold horse armor in ‘The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion’ for $2.50.
Since then, the latter has exploded in popularity across different game universes. But therein lies the caveat.
In-game purchases like skins (i.e., digital assets) are by and large limited to the respective game ecosystems in which they are bought.
For example, the aforementioned Fortnite skins can only be used or displayed on Fortnite.
In addition to this, very few of these assets are tradable or monetizable by their owners in any shape or form.
This siloed approach to in-game purchases is not only frustrating for players, but it’s also a missed opportunity for developers.
By keeping these digital assets locked within their own ecosystems, they’re limiting the potential for cross-platform collaborations and missing out on the chance to create a thriving secondary market for digital goods.
Now, if you’re reading this, it should come as no surprise to suggest Web 3.0 as a solution to the problem.
Migrating in-game assets to on-chain networks like Ethereum’s allows players to have a wider range of control and true ownership of their assets.
By storing in-game assets on-chain, players will be able to easily sell, trade and effectively monetize their assets.
Let’s dive into how this works, and why it’s only the tip of the spear.
What do in-game purchases look like on-chain
Layer-two scaling solutions like Immutable have worked to provide NFT (non-fungible token) infrastructure on the Ethereum blockchain to reduce the cost of NFT minting.
The NFTs are, of course, representative of the in-game assets being purchased.
By selling assets as NFTs, Web 3.0 gamers have the ability to easily trade and transfer their in-game assets to different wallets.
Additionally, NFT assets give the game absolute ownership of their purchased goods.
While some argue that the first order of business is to simply prioritize using Web 3.0 as a way to store and transact purchasable game assets, others believe we should move the entire experience on-chain.
By creating a decentralized ecosystem for in-game assets, we can foster a new level of trust and transparency between players and developers.
Bad actors or game developers would be unable to manipulate prices and prevent gamers from being subject or entire games leaving the market (along with your in-game purchases).
With blockchain, everything is out in the open, verifiable and transferable.
Imagine being able to flaunt your hard-earned Fortnite skin in ‘Call of Duty’ or trading your ‘World of Warcraft’ sword for a rare Pokémon.
The future of gaming
So, what does the future of gaming look like with on-chain purchases?
For starters, we can expect to see a lot more cross-platform collaborations and integrations.
Developers will be incentivized to create assets that can be used across multiple games, creating a more interconnected gaming ecosystem.
We can also expect to see a rise in player-driven economies, where gamers have more control over the value of their digital assets.
With the ability to trade and sell items on secondary markets, players will be able to make real money from their gaming habits – something that’s already happening in the world of esports.
But perhaps the most exciting prospect is the potential for new types of gaming experiences that were never possible before.
Imagine a game where your actions and choices have real-world consequences, thanks to the use of smart contracts and decentralized governance.
Games could also improve on the largely flawed play-to-earn model, allowing you to earn cryptocurrency by completing quests and challenges.
Of course, the path to on-chain gaming is not without its challenges.
There are technical hurdles to overcome, such as scalability and interoperability between different blockchain networks.
There are also legal and regulatory issues to navigate – particularly when it comes to gambling and the use of tokens.
But perhaps the biggest challenge is convincing gamers and developers to embrace this new paradigm.
Change is never easy, and there will undoubtedly be resistance from those who are comfortable with the status quo.
But as more and more players experience the benefits of on-chain gaming, we can expect to see a gradual shift in attitudes.
Takeaways
Put simply, on-chain gaming in the near future isn’t just some Web 3.0 pipe dream – the possibility of a world where your skins, coins, loot boxes and others aren’t just meaningless pixels anymore is just around the bend.
In-game purchases will become valuable assets that you can trade and sell or even use across different games.
Sure, there are still some kinks to work out – like figuring out how to make everything play nicely together and convincing the bigwigs in the gaming industry to get on board.
However, once people start seeing the benefits of on-chain gaming, there’ll be no going back.

Bitcoin's Volatility Drops Below Major Tech Stocks, Signaling Maturity and Stability as an Asset Class



                    

Bitcoin‘s annual volatility has recently dipped below that of top tech stocks like Tesla, Meta, and Nvidia, positioning it closer to a more mature and stable asset class.



As of May 11, the 1-year realized volatility of Bitcoin was approximately 44.88%, which is lower than the over 50% seen in these major tech stocks. 




This marks a significant shift from Bitcoin’s earlier days when its volatility exceeded 200%, reflecting the usual traits of a new asset class experiencing high capital inflows.



The decreasing volatility signifies Bitcoin’s evolution, as Fidelity Investments reports. 



Notably, Bitcoin showed lower volatility compared to 33 out of approximately 500 S&P 500 index companies. 




A pivotal observation made in October 2023 highlighted that “Bitcoin was actually less volatile than 92 of the S&P 500 stocks in October of 2023 when using the 90-day realized historical volatility figures. 



Some of these names are also large-cap and mega-cap stocks.” This suggests a growing stability relative to significant market players.



Bitcoin’s stability trajectory mirrors that of gold in its early years, which initially faced high volatility followed by gradual stabilization. 



Gold, after its decoupling from the U.S. dollar in 1971, saw its volatility soar above 80 in the 1970s, nearly double that of Bitcoin’s in April 2024. 




However, as gold settled into an established asset class, its volatility lessened, paralleling Bitcoin’s current path toward integration into the broader financial landscape.

Recent comparisons further underscore Bitcoin’s maturation. 



Its current volatility is around 44% at price levels above $60,000, significantly lower than the 80% noted three years prior when prices were similar. 



Fidelity researcher Zack Wainwright explains the implications, stating, “Bitcoin was nearly half as volatile in 2024 at $60,000 when compared with 2021. 



When putting this all together, a thesis pointing toward a growing acceptance of Bitcoin due to potential maturation begins to emerge.”



The reduction in volatility has often preceded substantial price surges, indicating an increase in investor confidence and accumulation behavior. 



This pattern was observed in December 2023, when Bitcoin’s reduced volatility of about 43% was followed by a 75% price increase, driven by demand for spot Bitcoin ETFs in the U.S., which had attracted $11.68 billion by May 11.



Looking ahead, significant investment inflows are expected from major institutional players, including sovereign wealth funds and pension funds, engaging with Bitcoin ETFs. 



BlackRock’s Robert Mitchnick and independent market analyst Scott Melker suggest that the growing institutional involvement, driven by Bitcoin’s newfound stability, could propel its price to between $100,000 and $150,000. 



Melker emphasizes the importance of patience, noting, “The massive institutional flood of money that will drive bitcoin to all-time highs.”

Vanguard names Bitcoin-friendly former BlackRock exec as new CEO

Asset management giant Vanguard has named Bitcoin-friendly former Blackrock executive Salim Ramji as its new CEO.With Ramji overseeing the approval and launch of BlackRock’s spot Bitcoin exchange-traded fund earlier this year, his May 14 appointment to Vanguard has industry pundits wondering whether he will try to change the firm’s long-held opposition to Bitcoin (BTC), or even spark a late filing for a spot Bitcoin ETF. In a May 15 post to X, Bloomberg ETF analyst James Seyffart said he doesn’t believe that Ramji would be able to see Vanguard launch its own spot Bitcoin ETF product. However, Seyffart does think Ramji could reverse Vanguard’s position on not allowing its clients to buy spot Bitcoin ETFs on its brokerage platform.Fellow Bloomberg analyst Eric Balchunas shared a similar opinion but noted Ramji had spoken highly of Bitcoin and blockchain technology in the past:“Who knows... Door much more open now IMO.”Balchunas described Vanguard’s decision as a “semi-shock,” as it is the first time the firm has hired an outsider as its CEO.Source: Eric BalchunasRamji will replace Tim Buckley — a long-time Bitcoin critic — as Vanguard’s CEO starting July 8.Vanguard had been on the lookout for a new boss since late February this year when Buckley first announced his plans to retire.Ramji said he left BlackRock to “seek a new leadership or entrepreneurial opportunity” outside of BlackRock four days after he helped the firm launch its iShares Bitcoin Trust on Jan. 11, 2024. He served as BlackRock’s Global Head of iShares and Index Investments and was one of the firm’s Global Executive Committee members.Related: Vanguard among MicroStrategy’s largest shareholders, indirectly exposed to BitcoinSome of Vanguard’s long-time customers threatened to close their accounts in January when the investing firm decided not to offer the spot Bitcoin ETFs on its brokerage platform.The decision was made at a time when Vanguard offered the “Inverse Jim Cramer ETF.”Vanguard doubled down on its call not to offer a spot Bitcoin product, asserting that Bitcoin simply isn’t in line with the firm’s investment philosophy.“Our perspective is that these products do not align with our offer focused on asset classes such as equities, bonds, and cash, which Vanguard views as the building blocks of a well-balanced, long-term investment portfolio.”Magazine: Bitcoin ETFs make Coinbase a ‘honeypot’ for hackers and governments: Trezor CEO

Ethereum Spot ETF Approval Odds Decrease For Later This Month As Analyst Points Out SEC 'Considering the Security Question for the Asset' - Benzinga

Ethereum ETH/USD proponents might still be optimistic about a spot ETF approval but analysts tracking the developments increased the odds of a rejection by the SEC.What Happened: Analyzing a March filing submitted by BlackRock Inc. to the SEC over its ETF application, finance lawyer Scott Johnson discovered “official” signals of the regulator viewing Ethereum as a security.The SEC while delaying the approval, also sought public feedback on whether the applicant properly filed its ETF listing proposal as a commodity.Johnson noted that this question was asked for all the ETF filings and never for any Bitcoin BTC/USD spot/futures ETF product. "The obvious purpose is to potentially deny on the basis that these spot filings are improperly filed as commodity-based trust shares and do not qualify if they are holding a security," he added.Responding to his findings, Bloomberg analyst James Seyffart increased the likelihood of a spot ETH ETF rejection, convinced that the regulator was considering the security question for ETH. Bloomberg ETF analyst Eric Balchunas entered the discussion as well, emphasizing, "Our odds of approval remain the same: slim to none."Why It Matters: The SEC is due to decide on VanEck's spot Ether ETF by May 23 – the final deadline for the first batch of proposals enabling investors to bet on the spot price of the world's second-largest cryptocurrency. Ethereum’s status has become the major sticking point, with the SEC allegedly launching a covert operation to brand the cryptocurrency as a security. A rejection might pose further pain for the asset, already hampered by a sluggish market in recent weeks.Price Action: At the time of writing, ETH was exchanging hands at $2,888.08, following a 2.16% drop in the last 24 hours, according to data from Benzinga Pro.Read Next: Bitcoin, Ethereum, Dogecoin Dip As Wholesale Prices Breach Estimates: Analyst Explores Possibilities Of A Bitcoin Jump To $68K

Degens pumped GameStop memecoins because they're ‘bored’ - Traders

The price of unofficial GameStop memecoins have spiked alongside the rise of Gamestop’s (GME) share price due to a general sense of sluggishness in the market, say several crypto traders.“People are bored and are taking any little sign of hope they can,” pseudonymous crypto trader Daan Crypto Trades told Cointelegraph.“The excitement generated around GameStop memecoins demonstrates there’s capital out there that’s not being allocated,” Tyr Capital chief investment officer Ed Hindi told Cointelegraph.The Solana-based memecoin GameStop (GME) — which has no affiliation to the official company — rose by 2,727% in the last two days, alongside Gamestop’s stock price experiencing a 204.50% increase during the same time frame, according to CoinMarketCap and Google Finance data.GME has risen 65.68% over the past 24-hours alone. Source: CoinMarketCapIt came after well-known GameStop stock trader Keith Gill posted from his “Roaring Kitty” X account on May 12 for the first time in nearly three years. Gill went dark on social media on June 19, 2021, but returned after an extended hiatus, posting a typically cryptic meme of a gamer sitting up in their chair to announce his comeback. Meanwhile, among the top 100 cryptocurrencies, PEPE (PEPE) and Floki (FLOKI) were the only tokens to sustain significant gains during the same timeframe, rising by 35.73% and 11.27% respectively. DOGE (DOGE) and Shiba Inu (SHIBA) experienced spikes on May 12 but have since retraced by 1.76% and 1.39% over the past 24 hours.This signals that traders are chasing specific short-term narratives rather than having overall confidence in the entire market.“Investors are overreacting to short-term trends like the GameStop event precisely because the market is quiet at the moment. We need a new narrative in the crypto markets,” Hindi declared.Alongside this, the overall market sentiment has decreased over the past 30 days according to the Fear and Greed Index, falling by around 10 points to a "Greed" score of 64 as of May 15.Related: Bitcoin traders expect Fed Chair Powell to ‘pump our bags’ and BTC to target $80K+Daan believes that the GameStop price surge in the stock market reassured crypto traders that related memecoins in the crypto market would follow suit.“If the price moves up and people don't know why, they will think of narratives to support and explain why the price is doing what it does,” Daan explained, adding that the 2021 GameStop “saga is still on a lot of people's minds.”“I don't think anything but price going up needs to happen. I am always of the belief that price precedes narrative. So projects can have great fundamentals but if price doesn't move people don't care,” they added.On the contrary, Dynamo DeFi founder Patrick Scott believes “there’s no shortage of narratives” in the crypto market.“Tokenized real-world assets have grown from being practically nonexistent to billions of dollars in the past few years,” he told Cointelegraph and pointed to the trends currently emerging on the Solana and DePIN network:“Solana on-chain activity now rivals Ethereum, and Decentralized Physical Infrastructure Networks (DePIN) are bringing non-speculative revenue into crypto.”Magazine: What do crypto market makers actually do?

Controversial Social Media Personality Andrew Tate Dumps Bitcoin to Jin Meme Stock War on Hedge Funds | Cryptoglobe


                                
Andrew Tate, a former kickboxer known for his controversial online presence, has said on social media he sold $500,000 worth of the flagship cryptocurrency Bitcoin (BTC) to join the current meme stock trend and invest in GameStop (GME) in a bid to cripple a hedge fund manager betting against it.



In a series of videos on the microblogging platform X (formerly known as Twitter), Tate said that there’s a “hedge fund manager out there who’s going to lose $13 billion – his entire hedge fund – if the GameStop price opens at the current price.”



Tate’s motivations appear to be tied to a meme stock trading frenzy recently ignited that’s seemingly looking to mirror the 2021 meme stock frenzy that saw a $13 billion hedge fund, Melvin Capital, close its position on GME and accept significant losses on it.







The recent meme stock trading frenzy started after a trader central to the 2021 movement, Keith Gill, known on X as RoaringKitty and DFV on Reddit, after he returned to social media from a three-year hiatus that ended after his testimony in Congress.











            
            

            
            

            
            

        

In a series of videos on social media, Tate noted that he is “going all-n, maximum leverage, all-in on all these stocks,” adding “we are taking down Wall Street, we’re going to take them down ourselves.”



Tate maintained that financial gain is secondary, prioritizing the downfall of the unnamed hedge fund manager. This renewed interest in GameStop stock has sent its value skyrocketing, with the company’s stock price surging more than 200% over the last few days to now trade close to the $50 mark.



AMC, another meme stock, saw its value surge nearly 120% over the same period. The meme stock frenzy extends beyond traditional markets, however, as an unofficial Solana-based mem coin inspired by GameStop has witnessed even more dramatic gains.



In a follow-up video, Tate doubled down and said he is cashing in $6 million worth of cryptocurrencies in a bid to take on Wall Street hedge funds and said he is “prepared to lose everything.”

Sonne Finance, BlockTower Capital Hit by Cyber Attacks


Sonne Finance, a decentralized liquidity market protocol operating on Optimism and Base, has been struck by a significant cyber attack.
Blockchain security firm Cyvers detected the attack on May 15 in the early morning of Asia.
Sonne Finance’s Optimism Market Suspended Following the Incident
Initially, Cyvers reported that $3 million had been stolen from Sonne’s USD Coin (USDC) and Wrapped Ethereum (WETH) contracts on its Optimism chain. However, the situation quickly worsened. Within 30 minutes, Cyvers updated the loss estimate to $20 million.

“Sonne Finance, please take immediate action,” Cyvers warned.

About one hour after the warning, Sonne Finance addressed the incident on X (Twitter). The team also promised to provide more information later.

“All markets on Optimism have been paused. Markets on Base are safe,” it stated.

Following the incident, BeInCrypto discovered that scammers were attempting to exploit the situation. A fake X account, mimicking Sonne Finance, urged users to revoke all approvals to prevent loss.

It shared a suspicious link to “check exposure to the exploit” and revoke approvals. However, the tweet was later deleted.

BlockTower Capital, a crypto investment firm, also experienced a cyber attack in a separate development. Bloomberg cited undisclosed sources saying fraudsters partially drained BlockTower Capital’s main hedge fund. The funds are still missing, and the hacker remains at large.
Furthermore, the source said the firm hired blockchain forensics analysts to track the stolen money. They also recently updated their limited partners about the heist. As of now, BlockTower Capital has not made any official statements about the incident.
Indeed, hacking incidents continue to trouble the crypto space. BeInCrypto had previously reported a reduction in hacking incident frequency by over 65% as of April 2024.
Yet, the loss amounts remain significant. According to the SlowMist Weekly Security Report from April 28 to May 4, 2024, the total losses from crypto-related security incidents reached $71.39 million.
This attack on Sonne Finance highlights the vulnerabilities in the decentralized finance (DeFi) sector. It also shows the need for strong security measures to protect digital assets.

BlockTower has responded, hiring blockchain forensics analysts to investigate the theft.

This isn’t the first time the firm has encountered trouble. in 2023, BlockTower lost around $1.5m in TRU tokens during a security exploit on the Dexibel decentralized exchange platform.BlockTower Capital was established in 2017 by Matthew Goetz and Ari Paul. Based in Miami, Florida, the firm focuses on professional trading, venture investing, credit underwriting, and managing portfolios for both digital and traditional assets. BlockTower actively trades liquid crypto assets, invests in real-world credit assets, and participates in next-generation venture investing within the web3 space.Web3 Users Still Targeted by Scammers, But Losses Decline
Hackers remain a major threat to the crypto industry, even though they stole less money in total during 2023 compared to 2022. This might seem like good news, but the number of hacking attempts actually went up. In 2022, there were 219 hacks, while in 2023 that number rose to 231.Still, the total value stolen dropped by a significant 54.3%, reaching $1.7b in 2023. This decrease was mainly due to a decline in DeFi hacks. Hackers managed to steal $1.1b from DeFi platforms in 2023, a steep drop from the $3.1b they took in 2022.Meanwhile, Web3 users lost $336m to hackers and scams in the first three months of 2024. A significant chunk, nearly half, was stolen in January. Despite the concerning losses, this actually represents a 23% improvement compared to the same period in 2023.

This Public Japanese Firm Has Added Bitcoin as Its Reserve Asset


																Bitcoin has continued to gain mainstream adoption, with major corporations and top industry dogs incorporating the digital asset into their long-term financial strategies.
Metaplanet, a Japanese investment and consulting company listed on the Tokyo Stock Exchange, is the most recent firm to make such a remarkable move.
Metaplanet Makes Bitcoin Reserve Asset
According to an official release, Metaplanet has adopted Bitcoin in its treasury management strategy, making the cryptocurrency its reserve asset. The company will prioritize a Bitcoin-first, Bitcoin-only approach, utilizing long-dated Japanese yen (JPY) liabilities and periodic share issuances as financial options to continually purchase more BTC.
“Metaplanet views bitcoin as fundamentally superior to any and all other forms of political currency, traditional stores of value and investment, and all other crypto-assets/securities. Bitcoin is an absolutely scarce digital synthetic monetary commodity, with no central issue,” the company said.
Metaplanet’s announcement comes roughly a month after the firm invested one billion JPY ($6.5 million) into BTC, marking its transition to the leading crypto asset.
The investment and consulting firm said the move is a response to the economic pressures on Japan, the weak yen, long periods of negative interest rates, and high government debt levels. Metaplanet’s new approach will increase on a BTC per share basis, enhancing shareholder value in the long term.




Struggles of the Japanese Yen
Japan’s challenging economic landscape saw the yen fall to 34-year lows a few weeks ago, amounting to a 50% depreciation against the USD in the past decade. Metaplanet explained that the country’s unsustainable financial trajectory suggests an increasing rate of monetary devaluation in the future.
Additionally, Metaplanet revealed that Japan’s debt-to-gross domestic product ratio is 261%, the highest in the developed world. The Bank of Japan implemented a negative interest rate policy in 2016 and artificially suppressed borrowing costs by printing the yen to purchase government bonds.
“This weakness is evident to all market participants and is only temporarily masked by sporadic interventions from the BoJ in both the government bond and foreign exchange markets,” the company added.
Metaplanet’s Bitcoin strategy would fortify its balance sheet against further devaluation of the yen and position the company as a BTC-focused investment vehicle.

PEPE Explodes To All-Time Highs - Leaves Dogecoin, Solana Trailing In the Dust - Benzinga

Frog-themed meme coin Pepe PEPE/USD stormed to an all-time high Tuesday, rendering all of its holders in profit at one point in the day.What Happened: The coin became the largest gainer in the memecoin market in the last 24 hours, and one of the largest in the broader market, with gains of more than 10%, according to data from Benzinga Pro. About 98% of its holders were making money at the time of publication, according to IntoTheBlock data, with the figure hitting 100% earlier in the day.The meme token pipped large-cap cryptocurrencies like Solana SOL/USD, BNB BNB/USD, and Dogecoin DOGE/USD in 24-hour trading volume, totaling $3.8 billion.The upsurge caught the eye of investors, leading some to fill their bags with PEPE. A trader withdrew more than 407 billion tokens, worth $4.4 million at prevailing market prices, according to Spotonchain. The big grab indicated expectations of PEPE's value rising further in the days to come.Why It Matters: Pepe was likely benefiting from the frenzy caused by the return of retail trader "Roaring Kitty," a catalyst that also sent other meme tokens flying. The surge also signaled the start of the second meme coin bull market of the year, the first of which in March offered enthusiasts of this class of cryptocurrencies enormous profits.In fact, one cryptocurrency trader underlined how it was the meme coins that were netting solid returns, while fundamental and utility tokens were letting them down.Price Action: At the time of writing, PEPE was exchanging hands at $$0.00001106, following a 10% jump in the last 24 hours, according to data from Benzinga Pro.Image Via ShutterstockRead Next: Ethereum Spot ETF Approval Odds Decrease For Later This Month As Analyst Points Out SEC ‘Considering the Security Question for the Asset’

Bitcoin could top $100K but only if 'high-yield rate' falls below 7% - Analyst

Only one main indicator is necessary to predict whether or not Bitcoin (BTC) can surpass its all-time high of $73,700 later this year, and it all rests on the shoulders of the United States Federal Reserve, says one analyst. “The U.S. high yield rate is a great indicator and it really needs to drop below 6 or 7% for a sustainable all-time high,” Timothy Peterson — Cane Island Alternative Advisors founder and investment manager — told Cointelegraph, explaining that the primary measure he looks to for Bitcoin's price action is interest rate movement.At the time of publication, the U.S. high yield rate — which represents the rate of high-yield corporate bonds because of their higher risk of default — is 7.54%, as per YCharts data.Peterson predicted that if yield rates fall within the “6 or 7%” range, Bitcoin could see the much anticipated $100,000 price tag by the fourth quarter of 2024, or at the latest second quarter of 2025.The US High Yield B Effective Yield is currently 7.54%. Source: YChartsTypically, the Federal Reserve lowering interest rates leads to the high-yield rate following suit, something that nearly two-thirds of economists surveyed predict will happen in September this year, per a recent survey conducted by Reuters.Interest rates are perceived as an important indicator for crypto traders, as lowering rates typically leads to less yield for investors in safe-haven securities such as bonds and term deposits. As a result, more investors turn to riskier assets such as Bitcoin to achieve better returns on investment.Bitcoin is currently trading at $61,871, down 5.08% over past 30-days. Source: CoinMarketCapPeterson argued that overall markets are generally “flat and volatile” between September and October.“Not always, but many times,” he commented, but with the upcoming U.S. election later this year, he claimed the “uncertainty will be higher through October,” ahead of the election day currently slated for November 4.Related: Bitcoin traders expect Fed Chair Powell to ‘pump our bags’ and BTC to target $80K+Meanwhile, crypto analyst Scott Melker, also known as "The Wolf of All Streets," declared that the Fed cutting interest rates isn't always favorable for assets outside of fixed-income investments.“There is a wildly popular theory that a Fed pivot is good for markets,” he stated in a May 14 post on X.“Rate cuts generally precede major dips,” he commented on the wider overall market.Magazine: Buy altcoins now, but sell before ‘mid-2025’: Charles Edwards, X Hall of FlameThis article does not contain investment advice or recommendations.

This Billionaire Predicted Bitcoin to Consolidate in Q2 2024


Michael Novogratz, the esteemed founder of Galaxy Digital Holdings, recently declared that Bitcoin might consolidate within a specific price range in the near future. 
During a conference call following his company’s first-quarter financial disclosure, he provided insights into the cryptocurrency’s trajectory. 
What can Cause a Bitcoin Breakout From the Consolidation?
Novogratz highlighted the integration of cryptocurrency into traditional finance as a pivotal factor in maintaining Bitcoin’s price within this range.

“We are in the consolidation phase in crypto. Bitcoin, Ethereum and everything else will consolidate, what does that mean? It means probably somewhere between $55,000 and $75,000 until the next set of circumstances, the next set of market events bring us higher,” Novogratz said on a conference call


This anticipated stabilization comes after a remarkable bull run driven by significant market catalysts such as the launch of US spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds and the halving event. The latter is a code update that reduces the issuance of new Bitcoin, historically serving as a bullish catalyst.
Following these events, the market has seen a period of stagnation. This is largely due to diminished optimism about potential rate cuts by the Federal Reserve, influenced by strong economic indicators. Since late February, Bitcoin’s price has fluctuated between $56,500 and $73,700.

“We had a lot of tailwinds in Q4 and Q1. I think that is probably where we are certainly for this quarter, maybe next quarter until either A, the Fed starts cutting rates because the economy finally slows or B, we get through the election and I think the election will bring clarity one way or the other to the crypto regulatory landscape,” Novogratz said.

Furthermore, the political environment could influence the market. Analyst Geoffrey Kendrick from Standard Chartered remarked that a potential re-election of Donald Trump could lead to less stringent crypto regulations compared to those under President Joe Biden. Such a policy shift might encourage global treasury holders to explore alternative financial assets like Bitcoin, potentially propelling its value upwards.
In March, Trump himself hinted at a softer regulatory approach toward cryptocurrencies, diverging from his prior preference for traditional currency. Despite never purchasing Bitcoin himself, Trump recognized its growing role in commerce. 


“There has been a lot of use of Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies, and I’m not sure I want to take them away at this point,” he commented. 

Meanwhile, Galaxy Digital reported a robust first quarter, with net income soaring to $421.7 million, marking a significant increase from the previous period. The company’s mining operations also grew substantially, generating a record $31.5 million in revenue.

This reflects a 69% rise from the previous quarter, fueled by an expansion in mining capacity. Galaxy’s trading revenue surged to $66 million, up 78%, driven largely by gains from derivatives and positive asset price movements.

Ethereum supply up by 100,000: What about ETH's 'deflationary status'? - AMBCrypto



Ethereum loses ultrasound money status.
Total supply has increased by over 100,000.

Ethereum [ETH] has transitioned from being labeled “ultrasound money” due to the EIP-1559 upgrade, which has altered its deflationary characteristics. 
This upgrade reduced Ethereum’s burn rate, leading to a slowdown in the rate at which Ether is removed from circulation. 
The total supply of ETH has increased, and there has been a recent rise in the supply of ETH on exchanges. How does the supply on exchanges compare to the total supply?
Ethereum total supply and fees burnt display contrasting trends
The analysis of Ethereum’s supply metric on CryptoQuant reveals notable fluctuations in total supply dynamics over recent months. 
From November 2023 to early April 2024, there was a discernible decrease in ETH’s total supply, dropping from over 120.2 million to approximately 120.06 million, marking a reduction of over 100,000 Ether.
Source: CryptoQuant
However, beginning from the 19th of April, Ethereum’s total supply started to ascend, reaching around 120.1 million at the time of this analysis. 
This recent increase in total supply is attributed to a decline in the fees burnt, which commenced following the Dencum upgrade.
An examination of the fees burnt metric illustrates a significant decrease, starting around March. 
During this period, fees burnt were approximately 6,000 Ether, contrasting sharply with the current value of around 890 ETH at the time of this analysis. 
This significant reduction in fees burnt accounts for the observed uptick in Ethereum’s total supply, indicating a shift in its deflationary dynamics. 
Also, the decline in fees burn is due to the decline in fees on the network.

Ethereum sees a decline in overall fees 
The recent Ethereum upgrade has led to a reduction in transaction fees, both on the main network and its Layer 2 solutions. 
Data from Coin98 Analytics indicated that Ethereum transaction fees has reached a yearly low, averaging 0.00017E, which translates to approximately $0.5 per transaction.
 This fees marks a significant decrease compared to levels observed around February.
Furthermore, analysis of the overall fees generated on the Ethereum network revealed a noticeable decline in recent times. 
As of this writing, the total fees were around $3.6 million, contrasting sharply with the peak recorded in March, which stood at approximately $7.8 million. 
This downward trend in fees commenced about a month ago.
Ethereum supply on exchanges climbs
Analysis of the Ethereum exchange supply indicates a notable upward trend, albeit with some interesting nuances. 
The increase in exchange supply began before the total supply started to rise, with the growth, observed between March and press time, amounting to over 3 million Ether.
 As of this writing, the total exchange supply was over 16.8 million.
Source: Santiment
Despite this significant growth, the exchange supply remained relatively low compared to the total supply of Ethereum. This suggests that Ethereum is facing a manageable risk of oversupply.
 Furthermore, the proportionately low exchange supply indicates that the current price of Ethereum is not under immediate threat from inflationary pressures.
ETH continues to trend below $3,000
Analysis of the Ethereum price trend on the daily timeframe is reflecting a challenging period. Following its drop below the $3,000 price level in the previous week, ETH has struggled to regain its footing. 
As of this writing, it was trading at around $2,900, experiencing a decline of approximately 1.5%.

Both the Stochastic indicator and the Relative Strength Index (RSI) were signaling a negative price trend. The RSI, in particular, indicated a bearish trend as it remained below the neutral line. 
However, the current position of these indicators suggested a potential price reversal in the near future, with ETH poised for a possible uptick.

Who's Buying The Bitcoin ETFs? Bitwise CIO Shares Insights


								In a new memo, Matt Hougan, Bitwise Chief Investment Officer Matt Hougan offered a detailed analysis of the early adopters of Bitcoin Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs) based on 13F filings with the SEC. His insights underscore a significant embrace of Bitcoin ETFs by professional investment firms, heralding a potential shift in the landscape of BTC investments.
Since their launch on January 11, Bitcoin ETFs have captured an impressive $11.7 billion in assets, making them the most successful ETF launch in the annals of financial products. This explosive start has sparked widespread interest in the identities of the investors—whether they are predominantly retail or professional.
Who Is Buying The Spot Bitcoin ETFs?
Hougan’s memo provides a clear answer. “A lot of professional investors own bitcoin ETFs,” he stated. These aren’t just any investors; they are some of the most respected and substantial asset managers in the industry. For instance, Hightower Advisors, ranked as the #2 RIA firm in the US by Barron’s and managing $122 billion in assets, now holds $68 million in Bitcoin ETFs. Similarly, Bracebridge Capital, a prominent Boston-based hedge fund that manages endowment funds for institutions like Yale and Princeton, has invested a hefty $434 million.

Other significant stakeholders include Cambridge Investment Research with $40 million, Sequoia Financial Advisors at $12 million, Integrated Advisors holding $11 million, and Brown Advisory with $4 million in Bitcoin ETF holdings. Altogether, as of the latest data from last Thursday, 563 professional investment firms have reported owning a combined $3.5 billion worth of Bitcoin ETFs. Hougan anticipates that by the May 15 filing deadline, these numbers could grow to over 700 firms with total assets under management nearing $5 billion.
“This is absolutely massive,” Hougan explained. “For any financial advisor, family office, or institution wondering if they were the only ones considering Bitcoin exposure, the answer is clear: You are not alone.”
From a historical perspective, the scale of professional investor ownership has been described as unprecedented. Eric Balchunas, a senior Bloomberg ETF analyst, referred to the number of large-scale investors involved in the Bitcoin ETFs as “bonkers.” By comparison, when gold ETFs launched in late 2004—a launch previously regarded as the most successful of all time—they attracted more than $1 billion in just five days. However, their first 13F filings showed only 95 professional firms investing. In contrast, Bitcoin ETFs have dramatically exceeded this mark right from their initial filings.

Despite this surge in professional interest, Hougan’s memo cautions that the total $50 billion assets under management in Bitcoin ETFs still have a substantial portion owned by retail investors. He estimates that professional investors currently account for only 7-10% of all assets. However, he suggested that media portrayal of these ETFs as “retail-driven” funds might overlook a critical emerging trend.
“Most investors follow a familiar pattern,” Hougan stated, describing a typical four-step investment trajectory observed among institutions. Initially, there is a period of due diligence lasting 6-12 months. Following this, professionals might make a small personal allocation to test the waters before recommending broader allocations to their clients. Eventually, this leads to more substantial, platform-wide allocations across their entire book of clients, typically ranging from 1-5% of the portfolio.
Given these insights, Hougan remains “incredibly” bullish about the future of Bitcoin ETFs. He concluded, “The allocations we see in recent 13F filings are just a down payment.” He highlighted that firms like Hightower Advisors, with a current 0.05% allocation, could potentially increase their investments substantially. “Multiply that by the growing number of professional investors participating in the space, and you can begin to see what’s behind my enthusiasm.”
Remarkably, yesterday, after Hougan released the memo, there was probably the most important 13F disclosure for Bitcoin to date. The State of Wisconsin Investment Board reported buying $99,167,688 (2,450,400 shares) of BlackRock’s IBIT and $63,687,310 (1,013,000 shares) of Grayscale’s GBTC.
At press time, the BTC price stood at $61,940.

Former FTX Exec Ryan Salame Asks for 18 Months in Prison

In filings, his attorneys argue that Salame’s role at the shuttered companies was less central to the fraud and more operational. They also cite cooperation with authorities, genuine remorse, efforts to address his substance abuse issues, and the significant personal and financial losses he has already suffered as a result of the exchange’s collapse.

                        Stablecoin issuer Circle plans to relocate its legal base from the Republic of Ireland to the US.Bloomberg reported on Wednesday that the company recently filed court paperwork to re-domicile. This follows Circle submitting plans for an initial public offering to the US securities regulator in January.“The initial public offering is expected to take place after the SEC completes its review process, subject to market and other conditions,” Circle said at the time.Circle Heads for US Shores, Leaving Ireland’s Tax Perks Behind
Choosing the US as its new home could mean Circle faces a higher tax burden, according to Bloomberg. Companies would generally do the opposite, flocking to Ireland for its business-friendly environment and low tax rate.The country’s 12.5% rate pales in comparison to many other European nations. This makes Ireland a magnet for international firms looking to keep taxes down.IPO Awaits SEC Nod and Market Conditions
Launched in 2013, Circle has carved a niche in the crypto industry. It is best known for issuing USDC, a stablecoin tethered to the US dollar. As of May 2024, USDC boasts a market cap exceeding $32b, solidifying its place as a major player.Circle’s core business focuses on issuing and managing USDC. Stablecoins are generally said to provide stability for transactions in the often-turbulent cryptocurrency market.Further, Circle’s plan to go public through a traditional IPO follows a failed 2021 attempt via a special purpose acquisition company (SPAC) merger. The IPO will proceed after SEC approval, but remains subject to market conditions and other factors.In January, Circle revealed plans to introduce USDC on the Celo network. Celo is a Layer-1 blockchain evolving into an Ethereum Layer-2 scaling network. This collaboration seeks to capitalize on Celo’s mobile-centric user community in areas with the highest blockchain adoption rates.

                        El Salvador, which became the first nation to use Bitcoin (BTC) as legal tender, could easily hold 5,750 Bitcoins, per “Bitcoin Office” report. The national Bitcoin Office is a government entity aimed at managing all projects related to the cryptocurrency.Per a Reuters report, the nation mined nearly 474 Bitcoins since 2021 using geothermal power fueled from the Tecapa volcano.The power plant’s official data released Tuesday, noted that the government holdings accounts to over $354 million at current prices. With the BTC wealth pool, the nation launched a Website on Tuesday for tracking its Bitcoin Treasury.The nation’s current Bitcoin holdings and the launch of a memepool website, signifies that El Salvador might eventually become one of the wealthiest countries in the world.Interestingly, President Bukele also stated that he has no plans to sell the country’s vast Bitcoin holdings. Bukele’s administration has installed 300 processors to mine Bitcoins from the volcano, the report added.El Salvador’s Bitcoin Mining From Geothermal Power
The geothermal state-owned power plant devotes 1.5 megawatts (MW) to cryptocurrency mining, out of its 102 MW produced.“We don’t spend resources that contaminate the environment, we don’t depend on oil, we don’t depend on natural gas, on any resource that isn’t renewable,” Daniel Álvarez, president of the Rio Lempa Hydroelectric Executive Commission, which oversees the plant, told AP News back in 2021.Bitcoin mining in El Salvador would appear to have a supportive government in Bukele. However, when it comes to cheap electricity, the nation imports about one-fifth to one-quarter of its electricity. The rest of the electricity production is divided among hydroelectric, geothermal and plants fired by fossil fuels.Among those, geothermal accounts for about a quarter of the country’s energy, given that El Salvador has 20 active volcanoes.According to a 2021 report, the energy produced from the geothermal turbines source about 300 computers. Bitcoins are “mined” using computers that solve complex mathematical problems and require a large amount of electricity to operate.In an industry that still relies heavily on polluting coal-fired power plants, the Salvadoran government is touting the use of clean energy for local mining.

BlockTower Capital Drained by Fraudsters


According to a Wednesday report by Bloomberg, the main hedge fund of cryptocurrency investment firm BlockTower Capital has fallen victim to a hacking incident.The stolen money has not been recovered yet. BlockTower Capital is currently working with blockchain sleuths in order to figure out how the hacking incident took place. The report has not specified what amount of assets has been stolen.BlockTower Capital was co-founded back in 2017 by former university endowment manager Ari Paul and former investment banker Matthew Goetz. In 2021, it acquired rival Gamma Point Capital to launch its market-neutral fund. However, the fund was shut down last year due to the lack of investment opportunities. BlockTower officially rolled out its $150 million venture capital fund in October 2022.The crypto investment firm has been impacted by hacking incidents before. In February 2023, BlockTower Capital was affected by the $1.5 million hack of decentralized exchange aggregator Dexible. BlockTower Capital suffered another setback due to its exposure to Silvergate Bank and Signature Bank, two cryptocurrency-friendly banks that went underwater last March. Crypto hacks plaguing the industry Cryptocurrency hacks remain a major issue for the nascent cryptocurrency industry. In 2022, hackers stole a whopping $4 billion. Last year, the amount of stolen funds reached $2 billion. Some of the most notable cryptocurrency victims of 2023 include Mixin Network, Euler Finance, Multichain, Atomic Wallet, and Poloniex. Meanwhile, according to UN experts, North Korea managed to launder nearly $150 million worth of stolen crypto this March alone.

More than one million new tokens have been launched since April

More than 1 million new tokens have been created since the start of April, with over 370,000 new tokens cropping up on Ethereum while over 640,000 new tokens — mostly memecoins — were launched on Solana. A total of 372,642 new tokens were launched on the Ethereum network since April 1 — 88% of which, or 327,553 — were launched on Coinbase’s layer-2 blockchain Base.

One commenter called it a “net negative” because of the proliferation of scams and rug pulls. That is real money that could have gone into bigger “legit” projects, they said before adding “Instead, it’s now in the hands of the scammer, who will cash it into fiat.” Others labeled the spike in the number of new memecoins as “spam to farm sniper bots” that are designed to automatically scoop up new memecoins in the hope of a breakout.In April, a Cointelegraph investigation revealed that one in six new Base memecoins were scams, and more than 90% of them had vulnerabilities.Despite the outrage directed their way, memecoins were the most profitable crypto narrative in the first quarter, as reported by Cointelegraph in April.Magazine: Meme coins: Betrayal of crypto’s ideals… or its true purpose?

LayerZero Sybil Bounty Event Will Be Launched With 15% Allocation For Fraudulent Addresses - Coincu



	

Key Points:




The LayerZero sybil bounty event starts May 18, and users who report fraudulent addresses will be rewarded by May 31.



Self-reporting sybil addresses, by May 17, receive 15% of their token allocation, while identified sybils get nothing.



Data from over 100,000 self-reported sybils will help LayerZero and Nansen train AI to detect fraud, benefiting future projects like zkSync.




LayerZero has announced the commencement of the LayerZero sybil bounty event, which aims to identify and penalize fraudulent actors in the crypto community.





LayerZero Sybil Bounty Event Will Be Launched on May 18



The LayerZero sybil bounty event starts at 02:00 UTC on May 18, with bounty reports closing at 23:59 UTC on May 31. Participants in the bounty program are required to submit reports that detail clear methods for at least 20 suspect addresses.



Bounty hunters who successfully identify a “sybil” (a fraudulent address) will receive 10% of the sybil’s expected token distribution, while the identified witch will receive no distribution. Addresses that self-report their fraudulent behavior by May 17 at 23:59 UTC will receive 15% of their intended allocation. Those who fail to self-report and are later identified by LayerZero or through the bounty hunt will not receive any tokens.



LayerZero CEO Bryan Pellegrino previously disclosed on the X platform that up to 100,000 addresses had voluntarily reported themselves as sybils to secure 15% of the initial airdrop tokens. Pellegrino emphasized the value of collecting data on these sybil wallets, which will help identify similar fraudulent activities in future projects.




Utilizing AI to Combat Sybil Attacks



LayerZero has also opened a public disclosure portal for users to confess their sybil behavior. The project will subsequently release a list of identified sybil addresses and initiate the bounty program to encourage community-driven reporting of sybil activities.



This initiative is part of LayerZero’s strategy to curb sybil attacks, where individuals create multiple accounts to maximize token airdrop benefits. LayerZero and Nansen, a blockchain analytics firm, will use a dataset of over 100,000 samples to train AI systems to detect sybil patterns, potentially benefiting future airdrops in other projects.



There are indications that zkSync might utilize Nansen’s AI to verify sybil wallet addresses for its upcoming airdrop, highlighting the broader impact of LayerZero’s efforts on the crypto ecosystem.



LayerZero has implemented snapshots as of May 1, giving users until May 18 to self-report their sybil behavior before the LayerZero sybil bounty event launches.

Layer-2 SocialFi Lens Network Based On zkSync Technology Launched - Coincu



	

Key Points:




Lens, the on-chain social network, is transitioning to its new home, the SocialFi Lens Network, built on zkSync’s ZK Stack hyperchains.



Developed by Lens Lab under Avara, Lens Protocol is moving to Layer-2 development, integrating Matter Labs’ ZK Stack for high throughput and cost-effective transactions.



Lens Network emphasizes data ownership and privacy, setting a new standard in social network construction while encouraging the migration of applications from Momoka to Lens Network.




Lens, the on-chain social network infrastructure, is undergoing a significant transition with the launch of its new home, the SocialFi Lens Network.





Lens Protocol Evolves: Introducing the SocialFi Lens Network



The move marks a pivotal moment for Lens, as it builds upon the foundation laid by the original Lens Protocol within zkSync’s ZK Stack hyperchains.



Originally developed by Lens Lab under the umbrella of Avara, the team behind the renowned DeFi giant Aave, Lens Protocol ventured into Layer-2 development with the vision of fostering a network of SocialFi applications. Currently operational on the Polygon Proof-of-Stake chain since May 2022, Lens is now poised to elevate its capabilities with the launch of Lens Network.



Matter Labs Collaboration Sets New Standard for Social Network Construction



The new protocol, leveraging Matter Labs’ modular ZK Stack infrastructure, will integrate a hybrid validium and volition Layer-2 solution. This integration aims to seamlessly interface with both Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) and non-EVM compatible blockchains, facilitating developers in building applications on Lens Network. Moreover, Lens Network will prioritize high transaction throughput for mainstream consumer applications while ensuring cost-effective transactions.




One of the notable features of SocialFi Lens Network is its utilization of account abstraction, enabling gas-free and no-login transactions for users. While Momoka, a Layer-3 Optimism solution launched by Lens in April 2023, will continue to operate, Lens encourages applications to migrate to Lens Network as it plans to discontinue Momoka.



Alex Gluchowski, co-founder and CEO of Matter Labs, commends Lens Network for setting a new standard in social network construction, addressing users’ concerns regarding data ownership, censorship resistance, and privacy seamlessly. Lens celebrated its permissionless launch in late February, witnessing a significant surge in daily activity and maintaining a steady active user count.

Dan Tapiero Says Bitcoin Turning ‘Scary Bullish,’ Unveils BTC Price Target After Clear Break of This Level - The Daily Hodl


								Macro investor and fund manager Dan Tapiero believes Bitcoin (BTC) is gearing up to print fresh all-time highs (ATHs).
The CEO of investment firm 10T Holdings tells his 115,600 followers on the social media platform X that Bitcoin could soar more than 45% from its current value if it crosses $65,000 again.










“Starting to look scary bullish for Bitcoin. Break of $65,000 goes right to $90,000, and then more. Very clear sideways overlapping flag type consolidation nearly done. Markets always surprise. Specific catalyst unclear but it doesn’t matter.”
Source: Dan Tapiero/X
Looking at his chart, the analyst suggests that Bitcoin is on the verge of completing a bull flag pattern, which in technical analysis is defined as a long upward trend, followed by a short period of downward consolidation before an upward breakout.
Tapiero believes that the Fed will cut interest rates this year due to commercial real estate weakness. He also predicts an even larger growth rate is coming to the ecosystem of digital assets.
“Fed is killing commercial real estate. No inflation here. Rates need to move lower pronto. Still expect 3%. Super bullish gold, Bitcoin, Ethereum. And ‘on-chain’ spring is upon us. Digital asset ecosystem growth is spectacular. Hypergrowth phase coming now.” 
Tapiero recently said that crypto assets are growing exponentially against traditional financial world assets and that an increasing number of investors will start moving over to digital assets to benefit from the larger returns.
Bitcoin is trading for $61,920 at time of writing, down nearly 2% in the last 24 hours.

Shiba Inu's Rocky Road to 2.5 Cents: Analysts Predict Long-Term Surge Despite Current Market Challenges



                    

The journey for the cryptocurrency Shiba Inu (SHIB) towards a potential price of 2.5 cents has been filled with challenges and fluctuations. 



Recently, the crypto market experienced a surge of enthusiasm that temporarily boosted several tokens, including Shiba Inu. 




However, this optimism quickly waned as the market downturn took over, leading to a significant decrease in SHIB’s value.



Currently, Shiba Inu is priced at $0.00002259, reflecting an 8.14% drop over the past week and a stark 32% decline from its price 60 days ago. 



Despite the enthusiasm of SHIB supporters for a substantial increase to $0.025, the path to reaching such a milestone appears increasingly difficult.




Amidst these market uncertainties, the analytics platform Telegaon has provided some insights into SHIB’s future price movements. 



According to their analysis, Shiba Inu might achieve the $0.025 mark between the years 2035 and 2040. 



Starting from its current price, SHIB would need to undergo a massive rally of 110,568% to reach this target.



This ambitious growth forecast is not unfounded considering Shiba Inu’s historical performance.

In January 2021, SHIB was trading at a mere $0.00000001, as per data from CoinMarketCap. 



By October of the same year, the cryptocurrency had surged to its all-time high of $0.00008845, marking an impressive 884,400% increase. 



This historical precedent suggests that a 110,568% rally is within the realm of possibility for Shiba Inu.



In their forecast, Telegaon anticipates that SHIB will eliminate three leading zeros from its price to hit the $0.025 mark in about 16 years. 



This view is corroborated by analysts at the cryptocurrency exchange Changelly, who also support a 2040 timeline for Shiba Inu to reach this price threshold.



As the crypto community watches these developments, the potential for Shiba Inu to replicate its past explosive growth remains a topic of keen interest and speculation. 



The consensus among experts seems to lean towards a long-term horizon for SHIB to achieve these ambitious goals.

BlockTower Capital Faces Security Breach, Loses Funds


							

BlockTower Capital has suffered significant losses in a recent hack, according to people familiar with the matter.



The hacker and the stolen amount are yet to be identified, and the firm has appointed a team to investigate.



Last year, the firm shut down its “market neutral” crypto fund, which once boasted over $100 million.




The institutional investment firm BlockTower Capital has reportedly suffered significant losses from a recent exploitation. A recent Bloomberg report stated that the company’s total loss in the hack remains undisclosed, and the hackers are yet to be identified.



BlockTower was founded in 2017 and has offices in Miami and New York. The firm has invested in various institutions, including the NFT developer Dapper Labs, the blockchain platform Terraform Labs, and the gaming studio Sky Mavis. While the firm raised a $150 million venture fund in 2022, BlockTower boasts around $1.7 billion in assets under management (AuM).



According to the Bloomberg report, the undisclosed fund is still missing. To identify the exploiter and recover the funds, BlockTower has appointed blockchain forensics analysts. The team is supposed to study the hack and find out the exact amount stolen.









In February 2023, decentralized exchange aggregator Dexible reported about a hacker who drained funds from many wallets. While the losses faced by these “few whales” accounted for 85% of the total loss, BlockTower was identified as one of the large victims. Though BlockTower declined to comment then, reports stated that the hacker stole about $1.5 million worth of TRU tokens from a wallet linked to BlockTower.



The report further shed light on the company’s last year setback. BlockTower shut down its “market neutral” crypto fund, which once boasted over $100 million.



Crypto hacks are one of the major threats in the industry that prevent new users from entering the market. Rosco Kalis, founder of Revoke.cash, stated that the users should be adequately educated on crypto to prevent these security threats.

Robinhood enables Solana staking for customers in Europe - Blockworks


Robinhood’s European crypto branch launched Solana staking.
The feature will offer roughly 5% APY at launch, though that could vary as staking rewards change, Robinhood Crypto general manager Johann Kerbrat told Blockworks in an interview. 
This puts Robinhood Crypto a tick below Coinbase, which offers an estimated reward of 5.42% for Solana stakers. The Phantom wallet offers Solana staking with an APY as high as 7.58%.
The firm chose Solana for its first staking product because SOL’s one of the most popular tokens among its EU customers, and staking on Solana is simpler than on Ethereum, Kerbrat said.
Read more: Robinhood’s crypto trade volume rose 10% in February
(Bitcoin is the most-held crypto among EU customers, Robinhood said in a press release.)
Kerbrat mentioned that the company was drawn to Solana’s shorter bonding period — the amount of time it takes before newly-staked assets begin earning yield. Solana’s bonding period is roughly two days, while Ethereum’s varies from a few days to a few weeks.
When asked if Robinhood Crypto would add staking for additional assets — like Ethereum — in the future, Kerbrat said “we are definitely thinking about it,” but declined to go into specifics. 
Robinhood Crypto launched in December as a crypto trading app in the European Union. The entity is registered and regulated in Lithuania, according to a Robinhood blog post. The company’s crypto arm noted that its app is highly downloaded by users in Poland, Italy and Lithuania.
Read more: Robinhood looks to jumpstart crypto trading revenue via EU expansion
Robinhood Crypto lists 33 tokens, as opposed to Robinhood’s US trading app, which only offers 15 crypto assets — even fewer in New York and Texas. 
SOL and Solana memecoins including BONK and DogWifHat are available in the EU but not the US.
Robinhood’s US arm delisted Solana — among other cryptocurrencies alleged by the US Securities and Exchange Commission to be unregistered securities — in June of last year after the agency filed lawsuits against Coinbase and Binance.
Robinhood’s crypto efforts in Europe are perhaps overshadowed by the company receiving a Wells Notice from the US SEC for its crypto listings last week. 
Read more: Robinhood discloses Wells notice over its crypto business
Robinhood and Robinhood’s EU crypto branch are “completely separate entities with different business models and different structures, and so at this point, the business in Europe is completely isolated from what’s happening in the US,” Kerbrat said.

                        The cryptocurrency market has witnessed the launch of over 1 million new tokens since the beginning of April.Ethereum and Solana, in particular, have been at the forefront of this token frenzy, with Ethereum hosting over 370,000 new tokens and Solana boasting an impressive 640,000 new tokens, mostly consisting of memecoins, according to a Dune Analytics dashboard.On the Ethereum network, a staggering 372,642 new tokens have emerged since April 1.Coinbase’s Base Attracts Majority of New Tokens
It’s worth noting that 88% of these tokens, amounting to 327,553, were launched on Coinbase‘s layer-2 blockchain Base.The surge in activity on the layer-2 network can be attributed to the growing interest in memecoins, as users are drawn to the low-cost environment for creating these types of tokens.In fact, Coinbase director Conor Grogan highlighted that the number of tokens created on Base within this short timeframe is double the total tokens created on Ethereum between 2015 and 2023.Simultaneously, Solana has seen a significant influx of new tokens, with an astounding 643,227 tokens created since April.Among these, approximately 466,914 tokens were memecoins, according to data from Step Finance.The popularity of memecoins on Solana is evident, as a dedicated dashboard tracking the number of new tokens launched on the Solana-based memecoin platform pump.fun confirms the trend.The rise of memecoins has sparked mixed reactions within the crypto community.Some argue that the proliferation of memecoins has had a negative impact on the industry, leading to an increase in scams and rug pulls.Critics view the abundance of memecoins as a diversion of funds from more legitimate projects. They argue that scammers now hold real money that could have been invested in projects with genuine potential.The surge in new memecoins has also raised concerns about spam and the use of sniper bots.These automated bots, designed to swiftly acquire new memecoins in hopes of profiting from a potential breakout, have been seen as a hindrance to the ecosystem.They contribute to the perception of memecoins as a speculative and volatile segment of the market.Despite the criticisms and concerns surrounding memecoins, they have proved to be a profitable narrative in the first quarter of the year.Solana Meme Coin Season Presales Amass $150 Million
The surge in Solana meme coin presale scams comes as these events have amassed a staggering $150 million in SOL from only 33 presales.Despite the allure of quick gains, analysts have emphasized that many of these projects, often promoted by smaller accounts, are either dubious or outright scams.Moreover, the lack of transparency and accountability within the meme coin space on Solana heightens the risk for investors owing to the prevalence of rug pulls and disappearing funds.Andrei Grachev, Managing Partner at DWF Labs, has also recently cautioned against such token presales.“This ‘send coins to this address for presale’ reminds me 2017 ICO boom,” he wrote on X.“It happens always when a lot of people become rich accidentally. It’d FOMO until money change their owners. Remember, you made money because someone made wrong decisions.”

GME have lifted exponentially this week, trumping the world’s largest cryptocurrency Bitcoin's BTC/USD yearly gains in a single day. What Happened: GameStop shares rallied 190% since the week began, according to data from Benzinga Pro, pumped by retail traders' excitement over the return of Keith Gill, aka "Roaring Kitty", a central character in the previous rally of shares in January 2021. Bitcoin, on the other hand, has risen 125% over the past year, paling in comparison to the GameStop whirlwind. That said, on a larger timeframe, the King Crypto's trajectory evoked more optimism. Since the last meme stock mania in Jan. 2021, Bitcoin has gained 91%, even breaching its previous peak earlier this year. GameStop, on the other hand, entered a multi-year decline and was unable to break through its prior highs. It was still trading 38% lower than its peak. Why It Matters: GameStop’s trajectory displayed brief, sharp surges brought on by social media events, but Bitcoin exhibited consistency over the years, bolstering its use case as a store of value asset.While the sustainability of GameStop's surge will be evident in the next few days, Bitcoin's growing mainstream penetration spurred by the launch of spot ETFs would mean a more stable ascent, away from wild fluctuations.Price Action: At the time of writing, Bitcoin was exchanging hands at $61,908.40, following a 1.14% drop in the last 24 hours, according to data from Benzinga Pro.Read Next: DOGE Is The First Crypto GME Folks Are Likely To Buy,’ Touts Trader That Turned 5 Figures Into 8 Figures With Meme Coins

                        Ryan Salame, a former executive at FTX who pleaded guilty to election fraud charges in September, is requesting leniency from the court in the form of an 18-month sentence.According to a sentencing memorandum filed on Tuesday, Salame’s attorneys argue for a lighter sentence based on his cooperation with authorities and genuine remorse.During his time at FTX and Alameda, Salame was responsible for managing wire deposits and fiat currency conversions for FTX customers.He also participated in political contributions using Alameda funds and led charitable initiatives in the Bahamas.Salame’s Attorneys Say Ryan Did Not Have Central Role
In the filings, Salame’s attorneys emphasize that his role in the fraudulent activities was less central and more operational.They said that he had no knowledge of the conspiracies orchestrated by the individuals at the center of Alameda and FTX.His attorneys added that Salame did not steal from anyone or deceive customers.They claimed that he was unaware of the fraud until later, and he promptly blew the whistle by reporting it to authorities in the Bahamas.“He had absolutely no knowledge that the four people at the center of Alameda and FTX had conspired to lie and to steal from their customers. Ryan stole from no one. He did not lie to customers,” they wrote.“He was duped…when he finally understood the FTX fraud, he was the first person to blow the whistle to authorities in the Bahamas.”Additionally, he willingly provided documents to the U.S. Attorney’s Office without the need for a grand jury subpoena.Salame’s attorneys also addressed the negative media scrutiny surrounding FTX and its CEO, Sam Bankman-Fried.They argued that the constant criticism has already resulted in punishment for Salame, both personally and professionally.They noted that Salame’s association with FTX and Bankman-Fried will forever hinder his job prospects.Caroline Ellison and Gary Wang, former executives at Alameda-FTX, have also pleaded guilty to charges and are seeking plea deals to avoid imprisonment.The court will consider Salame’s sentencing memorandum along with other relevant factors before making a final decision on his sentence.SBF Appeals Fraud Conviction and Sentence
Last month, Bankman-Fried filed to appeal his conviction and sentence for fraud and conspiracy charges.The disgraced crypto boss was convicted last November after a month-long trial on seven different charges and was sentenced to 25 years in prison.Meanwhile, the FTX bankruptcy estate has outlined its target to initiate repayments to customers by the end of 2024, as disclosed during a meeting of FTX Digital’s Joint Official Liquidators in the Bahamas. The FTX bankruptcy consists of two distinct processes, including the Chapter 11 bankruptcy being overseen by a Delaware court in the United States and the official liquidation of FTX Digital, the Bahamas-based subsidiary of FTX.However, both entities have agreed to collaborate, allowing creditors to submit their claims to either party while ensuring that no creditor receives less than their entitled value.

Stablecoins see reduced activity amidst market uncertainty: What now? - AMBCrypto



The stablecoins activity has taken a hit in recent weeks.
The dominance chart reflected reluctance from market participants to buy assets.

Bitcoin [BTC] was under pressure in the lower timeframes from the bears. The halving and the subsequent retracement might be ending, and the summer could shape up to be a long consolidation phase.
This meant that the altcoin market also saw a bearish performance for the most part.
Sectors like memes have been the outliers, but overall the trend has been bearish over the past month.
AMBCrypto analyzed stablecoin behavior to understand market participants’ sentiment — are they willing to take risks yet?
User activity has fallen over the past month

AMBCrypto analyzed data from CryptoQuant to assess stablecoin usage. The active addresses metric chart above tracks the total number of unique active addresses, both sender and receiver.
Its 7-day simple moving average has trended downward since the 16th of April.
It had trended higher in February and peaked in early March when the market made strong gains. Just a few days after this peak, Bitcoin managed to push past the $70k barrier.
Its downtrend in recent days suggested reduced interaction and buying and selling activity, which hinted that participants were not bullish.

The exchange reserve has consolidated within a range in 2024. It dropped swiftly from the 23rd of April to the 10th of May, showing a pronounced decrease in buying power.
This implied that stablecoin holders were less able to spend their stables to buy crypto assets.
This changed on the 13th of May, as a sharp inflow of stables was spotted. Ideally for the bulls, the stablecoin exchange reserve continues to trend higher in the coming days.
When can we expect the crypto market to begin trending higher?
Source: USDT.D on TradingView
The Tether [USDT] Dominance chart tracked the market capitalization of USDT as a percentage of the total crypto market cap.
An uptrend in this metric shows participants preferred holding stables and remaining sidelined.
On the other hand, a downtrend usually comes alongside a market-wide rally. With USDT.D above the 4.9% support level, it is expected to move higher toward the 5.79% resistance.

If it can subvert expectations and drop lower, bulls can take it as a sign that going long is favorable.
However, technical and fundamental analysis of the crypto assets in question is still preferred before buying them, rather than relying solely on the Tether Dominance chart.

Litecoin (LTC) Faces $80 Barrier: Will It Hold or Break?


In today’s analysis, we will examine Litecoin’s (LTC) recent price action and its on-chain activity to understand the underlying trends and potential future mid-term movements.
Bitcoin’s struggles to break the $61K price level have put pressure on LTC, leading it to trade below the critical $80 support level. What’s driving this behavior? Let’s examine the details.
LTC is Trading Just Above a Critical Support Level
In the chart below, we observe Litecoin’s price action in the 4-hour timeframe. The red lines highlight key support and resistance levels. Currently, the price is around $79. A decline below the $75 range could trigger a cascade of liquidations, leading to further price depreciation.
LTC/USDT 4H Chart & Ichimoku Cloud: TradingView

The $80.37 level, near the $80 mark, aligns with the 0.618 Fibonacci retracement level and is crucial mid-term support. 
Litecoin’s price recently attempted to break below the 4-hour Ichimoku Cloud. If the price closes below the cloud, this could trigger increased volatility and lead to a continued mid-term price correction to $75.

If the price refuses to break above the cloud, it could signal a potential trend reversal.
Spent Volume by Age Bands Reveals Key Market Trends

The provided charts show spent outputs segmented by age bands. The green bars represent LTC held for 1 hour to 24 hours before being spent, blue bars indicate LTC held for 1 day to 1 week before being spent, light green bars show LTC held for 1 week to 1 month before being spent, and red bars reflect LTC held for 1 month to 3 months before being spent. The black line represents the LTC price in USD.
LTC Spent Volume by Age Bands: Glassnode
The most volume is spent within 1 hour to 24 hours (on average, 800K LTC is spent per day), indicating a lot of short-term trading activities. This rapid trading activity can make the price more volatile. 

Read More: How To Buy Litecoin (LTC) and Everything You Need To Know
On May 10, there was a significant sell-off by mid-term holders, those holding LTC for 1 to 3 months. This might indicate a change in sentiment or profit-taking behavior. Such spikes can lead to mid-term price drops.
LTC Spent Volume by Age Bands: Glassnode
Strategic Decision-Making and Outlook for Litecoin


Bearish to Neutral Outlook: LTC’s price struggles below the $80 support level, showing weakness after Bitcoin’s challenges at the $61,000 mark. This has led to fear among holders, with short-term investors exiting to cut losses.
Conditional Support: Should Bitcoin fall below 61,000, LTC might experience a notable mid-term price decline to $75.
Price Projections and Recommendations: In a bearish scenario, LTC could fall to $70 if Bitcoin’s price declines to 59K. To reduce risk exposure, traders should wait for the price to drop below $75 before buying. The ideal buy range would be around $70-$72 for an optimal entry position. Setting a stop-loss at $68 is advisable to manage potential downside risks and aim for a sell price of $85-$90 to capitalize on the next upward wave.

Bitcoin DeFi Tool Alex Lab Loses $4.3M in Hack, Offers 10% Bounty for Stolen Funds

Security researchers CertiK said the attackers likely caught hold of a private key that controlled ALEX’s XLink bridge, a service that lets users transfer tokens between different blockchains. The hacker transferred over $300,000 worth of bitcoin (BTC), $3.3 million worth of stablecoins and $75,000 worth of Sugar Kingdom (SKO) tokens.

Boom della crypto Pepe: superate Solana e Dogecoin per volumi

The daily trading volumes of the crypto Pepe have exceeded those of Dogecoin and Solana. 
Indeed, in the last 24 hours the total trading volumes of the PEPE token on crypto exchanges was about 3.8 billion dollars, while SOL did not exceed 2.4 billion and DOGE remained below 1.7. 
Even BNB did not exceed 2 billion, so excluding stablecoins only Bitcoin and Ethereum have outperformed Pepe, with 24.7 billion and 11.5 respectively. 
In other words, among the true cryptocurrencies in the last 24 hours Pepe was the third most traded overall, after BTC and ETH, surpassing all the others. 

The boom of the crypto Pepe: surpassing Dogecoin and Solana
Technically Pepe is not a real cryptocurrency, but a token on Ethereum.
It belongs to the so-called meme-coins, of which Dogecoin is the main representative. 
Yesterday, however, Pepe was not only the most traded meme-coin, but also the most traded altcoin overall, since both Bitcoin and Ethereum are now making history on their own.
To tell the truth, this boom of Pepe started two days ago, when the price went above 9 millionths of a dollar.
Later it also rose above 10 millionths, setting the new all-time high today at 11.4 millionths of a dollar. 
The previous record was on March 13, the day before the new all-time high of Bitcoin, when the price of the PEPE token touched for the first time in its history the 9 millionths of a dollar.
So the increase since then has not been particularly high, also because by mid-April it had dropped below 5 millionths. 
Being a meme-coin, it has a very volatile price, supported only by speculation or the community that follows this memecoin. 
Meme-coin and meme-stock
The recent boom of Pepe in the last few days was most likely triggered by a new boom of the so-called meme stocks on traditional stock exchanges. 
At this moment the meme-stock par excellence is GameStop (GME), which in the last three sessions of the New York Stock Exchange has even gained 160%. 
Even in this case we are dealing with purely speculative titles, so much so that a +% in three sessions on traditional stock exchanges is really something very anomalous. 
Actually, the rise of the GME stock started on May 2nd, when in less than ten days its price went from $11 to almost $20. 
Only the climb did not stop there. 
Indeed, probably also thanks to an organized and coordinated action of retail investors who follow the trend of this stock, it resumed on Monday, bringing the price to almost $65 yesterday. 
However, there was a correction afterwards, with the price returning below $50. 
Note that these are not absolute highs, as in a situation quite similar to January 2021 it even exceeded $120. 
The following month ended up collapsing below $10, but then bounced back. 
Starting from December 2021, when the last major bull run ended, the price of GameStop shares began a slow descent that, within two and a half years, brought it from $40 to less than $10. 
This decline stopped right at the end of April 2024, and always just below $10, which is the same price level it bounced back to in February 2021. 
Even on the first of May the price was around $11, then with three jumps it was brought back above $15, then above $20, and then even above $40. 
Now this sequence of leaps may have been interrupted, although it should not be forgotten that from the current $48 to the all-time high of $120 there is still a lot of room in theory. 
Dogecoin and Solana: volumes beaten by the crypto PEPE
It is worth noting that the surge of the meme-coin Pepe has not been replicated by the main meme-coin in the world, namely Dogecoin. 
DOGE for example is the only meme-coin present in the top 10 cryptocurrencies by market capitalization, while Pepe is only in 27th place with a market capitalization that is four and a half times lower than that of Dogecoin. 
However, for some time now the price of DOGE has lost some volatility, perhaps due to its relatively high market capitalization. 
Dogecoin even loses 2.5% in the last 24 hours, and more than 9% in the last 30 days. 
After rising above $0.10 in March, it started a period of sideways movement that is still ongoing. 
Note that it is still down 80% from the historical highs of 2021. 
In theory, Solana could also have benefited from this renewed, albeit brief, interest in meme-coins. In fact, many new meme-coins have been issued on the Solana blockchain. 
And instead SOL is losing 1.7% in the last 24 hours, and in the last 30 days it is down 5.5%. 
The price trend of Solana is instead much more similar to that of Bitcoin and Ethereum, which reveals that probably not many SOL are used to move meme-coin tokens on the Solana blockchain. 
Other meme-coins
Although Pepe is, among the main meme-coins, the one that has recorded the best price performances in recent days, there are also others that are performing well lately. 
First of all Floki, whose price has increased by 10% in the last 24 hours. 
Note that Floki’s current price is only 37% lower than its 2021 all-time highs, paradoxically in line with the -41% of ETH. 
In theory, Floki should move similarly to Dogecoin, but instead it is following more the trend of Pepe on one side, and Ethereum on the other. 
It should be remembered that Pepe was not there yet in 2021. 
Another meme-coin that is performing relatively well is Bonk, based on Solana, although in the last 24 hours it has only recorded a timid +1.5%.
Even Bonk was not there in 2021, but despite this, it is down by -47% from the March highs. 
What is surprising, however, is the -6% drop in the last 24 hours of WIF (dogwifhat), the meme-coin on Solana that theoretically should behave similarly to Floki or Dogecoin. WIF has only been around since December, and at the moment it is down 40% from its March highs. 
The other great meme-coin, SHIB (Shiba Inu), has been remarkably stable for two months now, so much so that its behavior on the markets doesn’t even seem so much like that of a meme-coin anymore. 
Its price, however, is down by -73% from the highs of 2021, in line with that of DOGE from this point of view.

Bear pressure casts a shadow on BNB price recovery: does Bitbot offer a better chance? - CoinJournal



                    

                    
BNB struggles below $600, facing bearish pressure and uncertainties amid the Alex Protocol Bridge incident.
Bitbot (BITBOT) emerges as an alternative, offering institutional-grade trading on Telegram.
Bitbot (BITBOT) token is currently in its presale stage and it is priced at $0.018 per token.

BNB price is struggling to regain momentum amidst uncertainties and the recent Alex Protocol Bridge suspicious withdrawals that rocked the BNB Smart Chain network.
Meanwhile, Bitbot emerges as a potential alternative, promising innovative features and a new token.
BNB price recovery in limbo amid Alex Protocol Bridge incident
BNB’s journey towards recovery faces hurdles as it contends with bearish signals below the $600 mark. Despite attempts to breach resistance levels at $575 and $585, the token finds itself in a precarious position.
The failure to clear the $600 resistance zone triggered a fresh decline, exacerbating concerns among investors.
Compounding the challenges is the recent incident involving the Alex protocol bridge on the BNB Smart Chain. The protocol suffered a staggering $4.3 million in suspicious withdrawals immediately after its contract underwent a sudden upgrade. CertiK, a blockchain security platform, labeled the event as a possible private key compromise, highlighting the vulnerability of decentralized networks to malicious activities.
Bitbot (BITBOT) token offers an alternative opportunity
Amidst the uncertainties surrounding BNB, Bitbot (BITBOT) emerges as a potential alternative, offering innovative solutions in the crypto trading landscape.
Bitbot is an AI Telegram trading bot designed to empower users with institutional-grade tools, enabling seamless trading experiences directly from Telegram while maintaining full control of assets. The platform’s unique features include leveraging custom RPC nodes and institutional infrastructure to outpace the competition, handling sudden influxes of traffic during popular project launches, and ensuring assets are accessible only with user permission.
Currently conducting its presale, Bitbot has raised approximately $3,408,687 out of its $3,546,000 target. With each BITBOT token priced at $0.018 during the presale stage, Bitbot presents itself as a compelling option for traders seeking a reliable and secure trading platform.
Conclusion
In the midst of bearish pressures and uncertainties surrounding BNB, Bitbot stands out as a promising contender in the crypto trading sphere. With its innovative approach and focus on providing users with robust trading tools, Bitbot offers an alternative avenue for traders to navigate the volatile market landscape.
As investors weigh their options amidst ongoing market challenges, Bitbot’s presale success and unique features position it as a potential game-changer in the crypto trading ecosystem. The platform’s commitment to security, reliability, and user empowerment sets a new standard for trading platforms, providing traders with confidence and peace of mind in their investment endeavours.

Crypto news: 'CryptoDad' Giancarlo joins Paxos board

The lawyer and author of “CryptoDad: The Fight for the Future of Money”, J. Christopher Giancarlo, known for his commitment in the crypto field, will join the leadership of Paxos, a stablecoin issuer. 
Giancarlo, former head of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, has long supported cryptocurrencies, a commitment that contributed to his knighthood in France.
Let’s see below all the details. 

The entrance of the well-known crypto supporter, ‘CryptoDad’, into the board of directors of Paxos
As anticipated, Paxos has announced the addition of J. Christopher Giancarlo, former chairman of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) of the United States and a well-known advocate for cryptocurrencies, to its board of directors.
Giancarlo joins Paxos at a time when the stablecoin issuer and infrastructure platform are expanding their range of tokens, including the issuance of PayPal (PYUSD). 
Furthermore, they have recently integrated the Solana blockchain after adding Ethereum the previous year. In terms of regulation, Paxos Trust is subject to supervision by the New York Department of Financial Services.
Just last year it highlighted some issues regarding its Binance USD (BUSD), although this relationship with tokens was later discontinued.
J. Christopher Giancarlo and the potential of cryptocurrencies 
Giancarlo, who joins the board of directors together with former senator Bill Bradley, is the author of the book “CryptoDad: The Fight for the Future of Money”. 
He is also the founder of the Digital Dollar Project, an initiative aimed at exploring the possibility of a digital currency from the US central bank (CBDC). 
Charles Cascarilla, CEO and co-founder of Paxos, praised Giancarlo for his commitment to promoting blockchain and improving financial infrastructure. 
Specifically emphasizing that his skills will support Paxos in expanding its leadership in the regulated digital asset market and in the innovation of stablecoins.
Currently a lawyer at Willkie Farr & Gallagher and co-chair of the digital works practice, Giancarlo was knighted in 2022 for his contribution in the field of cryptocurrencies. 
To the point that even the French ambassador to the United States recognized his knowledge of financial markets and the potential of cryptographic finance.
In a statement, Giancarlo expressed his honor in joining the board of directors of Paxos and in contributing to innovation in the financial sector. 
Specifically highlighting Paxos’ leadership role in connecting traditional and digital asset markets through regulated and secure solutions for institutions and consumers.
Digital Dollar Project: what is it and how does it work
As mentioned, J. Christopher Giancarlo is the founder and director of the Digital Dollar Project (DDP), which is leading the launch of a series of pilot programs to explore the potential of a central bank digital currency in the United States (CBDC).
The senior consultant, Giancarlo, has overseen the launch of at least five pilot programs over the years, in collaboration with stakeholders and DDP participants. 
The main goal of these programs is to measure the potential value of a US CBDC and provide crucial information about it. 
Pilots indeed explore a wide range of aspects, including technical and functional requirements, benefits and potential challenges, commercial applications, and use cases for both retail and wholesale. 
The results of the pilot projects are made public and used for future academic studies and political considerations. 
Giancarlo emphasized the importance of fully understanding the complex issues related to a CBDC, such as privacy, financial inclusion, and the rule of law. 
It has also emphasized the open approach of the Digital Dollar Project in conducting research, experiments, and developing lines of thought to inform public policies.
Before taking on the role of Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of the CFTC, Giancarlo played a key role in regulating derivative markets, paying particular attention to emerging technologies such as blockchain and cryptocurrencies.
During his tenure, he oversaw the introduction of the first futures products on Bitcoin and adopted a “Do No Harm” regulatory approach towards blockchain technology.
The Digital Dollar Project relies on a diverse advisory group, composed of economists, business executives, technologists, lawyers, academics, consumer advocates, and human rights experts.

$20M exploit cripples Sonne Finance, hacker in no mood for negotiation

Lending protocol Sonne Finance was forced to pause operations after suffering a hack that drained $20 million worth of cryptocurrencies from the market.On May 14, around 10:30 pm UTC, Web3 security firm Cyvers detected an ongoing attack on Sonne Finance’s USD Coin (USDC) and Wrapped Ether (WETH) contracts. However, when Sonne Finance became aware of the situation 25 minutes later, the hacker had already stolen $20 million in WETH, Velo (VELO), soVELO and Wrapped USDC (USDC.e).Source: Sonne FinanceOn May 15 at 12:11 am UTC, Sonne Finance announced on X that “All markets on Optimism have been paused.” Soon after, the protocol partnered with Cyvers to investigate the situation further.Sonne is currently exploring all options to retrieve the stolen funds, including negotiating a bug bounty for the hacker. In such situations, the hacker returns most of the stolen funds and keeps roughly 10% of the loot as a reward for finding a security flaw. However, the hacker seems to be in no mood for negotiations. According to blockchain investigator PeckShield, the exploiter has already moved a large chunk of the loot ($7.8 million) to a new wallet address.Source: PeckShieldThe exploiter then swapped 59 WBTC for roughly 1,185 Ether (ETH) and 183,000 Dai (DAI). The move suggests an intent to siphon the stolen funds through a privacy protocol like Tornado Cash to deter traceability.Sonne Finance’s post-mortem found that a donation attack was conducted on Sonne’s Compound v2 forks, which had a known bug, according to X community member PoorBabyCorn. They accused Sonne Finance of using Compound v2 despite knowing the risks and asked, “If this isn’t a premeditated backdoor, what is?”In parallel, the main hedge fund of crypto institutional investment firm BlockTower Capital has reportedly been exploited and partially drained.The funds have not been recovered, and BlockTower has employed blockchain forensic analysts to trace the funds and determine how they were breached. The exploiter has also not been arrested, Bloomberg reported on May 15, citing people familiar with the matter.Related: Stolen Poloniex Ether worth $53M never made it back to the exchangeIts partners have been informed about the incident. It reportedly has $1.7 billion in assets under management.BlockTower did not immediately respond to Cointelegraph’s request for comment.In February 2023, BlockTower seemingly lost around $1.5 million in the $2 million exploit of the multichain exchange aggregator Dexible.Dexible said that around 85% of the stolen funds were from a “few big whales.” On-chain intelligence platform Arkham Intelligence labeled a wallet drained of $1.5 million as belonging to BlockTower.Magazine: ‘Sic AIs on each other’ to prevent AI apocalypse: David Brin, sci-fi author

Why Is the Market Up Today?


The total crypto market cap (TOTAL) along with Bitcoin (BTC) are noting barely any growth over the past day. However, among the altcoins, FLOKI noted an 8% rise to place itself among the top crypto assets.
In the news today:-

TOTAL Awaits a Breakout
The total market cap has been stuck within a symmetrical triangle for the past four weeks and is currently around the $2.2 trillion mark. A symmetrical triangle is a chart pattern formed by two converging trendlines that connect a series of peaks and troughs, indicating indecision in the market before a breakout.
Should this breakout occur, TOTAL could breach through $2.3 trillion to potentially initiate further recovery.

However, if the total market cap breaks down, it could slip to $2.11 trillion, as this level is the next crucial support floor.
Bitcoin’s Price Continues to Rise
Bitcoin’s price trading at $61,900 at the time of writing, has been in a macro uptrend since the beginning of the month. It has been struggling to close above the crucial support of $62,000. Reclaiming this is important as this would enable a rise to $63,000 and beyond.
If the uptrend continues and investors remain optimistic, a bullish outcome for BTC is likely. Breaching past the resistance at $63,700 will also lead to a rise to $65,000.

On the other hand, if $62,000 is not secured as support, a drawdown could occur. This could result in BTC losing the uptrend, resulting in a potential decline to $61,000.
FLOKI Is Among the Top Gainers
FLOKI’s price rallying is both a surprise as well as a predicted scenario. This is because the recent market conditions have been signalling a potential return of the meme coin frezy. However, FLOKI has not been the focus of investors amidst meme tokens like PEPE, BOME, WIF, etc.

The altcoin rose by more than 7.5% in the past day, bringing the price to $0.000203. FLOKI already closed above the support of $0.000185. Any further rally could push it towards the resistance at $0.000218, as the price is already at a two-month high.

However, a dip down to $0.000185 and losing it as support could send it to $0.000167. This support has been tested on multiple occasions in the past, and FLOKI will likely land here.

Historic Milestone As One Million New Tokens Flood the Crypto Market

Crypto's Election Season Is Kicking Off

Crypto has not really been an issue in past elections. Sure, there have been candidates who had previously addressed crypto or were adjacent to the industry, but there wasn't really a concerted effort to try and solicit people who believe crypto is a major, or the major, factor for their vote. To some extent, that seems to be changing, though it's still hard to quantify the extent to which the crypto contingent will be a major voting bloc.

Floki Soars As Holders Buoyed By Proposal to Remove 15.24B Tokens Out Of Circulation: The Burn Is Real - Benzinga

Floki FLOKI/USD gained significant positive momentum this week, fueled largely by the combination of the "Roaring Kitty" hype, and a fresh proposal to kick a large portion of the supply out of circulation.What Happened: The memecoin soared 23% since the week began, riding high on the social media comeback of retail trader "Roaring Kitty," an event that has also pumped meme stocks in the traditional markets.To top it up, a proposal by the Floki DAO–an organization that votes on decisions concerning the project– to burn a whopping 15.24 billion tokens, boosted the coin further. The proposal, polling for which ends on May 16, gained an overwhelming 99.84% votes in favor of the burn. Why It Matters: Cryptocurrency holders view burning events with optimism, anticipating that the supply squeeze would drive the price of the asset upward.In March, the passage of a proposal to burn 190 billion FLOKI tokens was met with similar euphoria, sending the coin 50% higher within a day. In the last 24 hours, FLOKI's large transaction volume soared by 88%, according to IntoTheBlock, reflecting increased participation from cryptocurrency whales. Additionally, long-term supply dipped by 0.03%, suggesting increased profit-taking. Price Action: At the time of writing, FLOKI was exchanging hands at $$0.0002021, witnessing a 6.22% jump in the last 24 hours, according to data from Benzinga Pro.Photo by Maurice NORBERT on ShutterstockRead Next: GameStop Might Have Outperformed Bitcoin’s Yearly Returns In A Single Day But Here’s Why King Crypto Evokes More Optimism

$291B Asset Manager Founder Predicts Bitcoin Will Hit $420,000


																In an interview with Yahoo Finance’s “Wealth,” Ric Edelman, founder of the Digital Assets Council of Financial Professionals and $291 billion asset manager Edelman Financial Services, provided a striking forecast for the Bitcoin price. Edelman argued that Bitcoin’s price could surge to $420,000, attributing this potential rise to a modest global asset allocation towards Bitcoin.
Why Bitcoin Price Will Reach $420,000
During the interview, Edelman delved into the advantages of investing in Spot Bitcoin ETFs. He noted that these instruments make Bitcoin accessible in the same way as traditional ETFs, which are commonplace and familiar to investors using ordinary brokerage accounts.
“They’re incredibly inexpensive, 20-25 basis points cheaper than going to say Coinbase or other crypto exchange and being in a brokerage account, you can rebalance, you can dollar cost average, you can tax loss harvest,” Edelman highlighted. This setup simplifies the investment process, making it akin to managing any other asset class, thus broadening its appeal to a wider audience.

However, Edelman was also candid about the challenges and risks associated with Bitcoin. Despite the advantages offered by ETFs, the inherent nature of Bitcoin as a volatile and risky investment persists. “It’s still Bitcoin, which means it’s still very volatile, it’s still very risky. You could still lose everything,” he cautioned.
Edelman pointed to ongoing regulatory uncertainty, potential lawsuits, and prevalent fraud as significant risks that investors need to manage cautiously. He also criticized the trend of investing due to fear of missing out (FOMO), labeling it as a poor investment rationale.
Looking ahead, Edelman discussed the regulatory landscape, particularly concerning other cryptocurrencies like Ethereum. He noted that there are several applications pending for Ethereum ETFs, and while he anticipates initial rejections, approvals could follow by year’s end.

“After you have the Bitcoin ETFs and the Ethereum ETFs, I’m not sure how quickly you’ll see anything else after that, but these two will kind of open the doors long term. Five years from now, there will be dozens, perhaps even hundreds of crypto ETFs,” Edelman speculated. This perspective underscores a significant shift towards mainstream acceptance and integration of cryptocurrencies into traditional financial products.
Edelman’s prediction of Bitcoin reaching $420,000 is based on an assumption of global asset diversification. By his calculations, if all global asset holders allocated just 1% of their assets to Bitcoin, this would translate to a market cap of $7.4 trillion for Bitcoin alone.
“It’s remarkably simple. If you take a look at the world’s global assets, the value of the stock market, globally, the bond market, the real estate market, the gold market, you just look at all the assets everybody in the world owns, it’s about $740 trillion,” he explained. Such an allocation would dramatically increase Bitcoin’s market cap, driving its price up significantly.
Moreover, Edelman highlighted a shift in the perception of Bitcoin from a transactional currency to a store of value, similar to gold. “The use case of Bitcoin, although it’s strong for transmittal, is not the strongest argument. It’s now like gold, a store of value,” he stated. This perception shift has attracted more institutional investors, who view Bitcoin as a hedge or an alternative asset class, akin to other non-traditional investments like artwork or collectibles.
At press time, BTC traded at $61,909.

DAI Supply Skyrockets: Possible Explanations


							

DAI supply surged 24% in two months, from 4.42 billion to 5.48 billion on May 12.



The surge is primarily fueled by the popularity of the Dai Savings Rate (DSR).



MakerDAO had raised the DSR multiple times to attract more users.




The supply of leading stablecoin DAI has seen a remarkable growth spree since early March, with a 24% increase in just over two months, rising from 4.42 billion to 5.48 billion on May 12, 2024.



For a while, the circulating supply of DAI was on a downward trend, but the surge since March has been primarily fueled by the popularity of the Dai Savings Rate (DSR). The DSR allows users to earn interest on their DAI deposits, resulting in increased demand for DAI.



As per The Block Data, the circulating supply of DAI has been declining as users burn DAI to deposit into the DSR, resulting in the creation of SavingsDAI (sDAI), which effectively reduces the circulating supply of DAI while increasing the supply of sDAI.



MakerDAO, the protocol behind DAI, has raised the DSR multiple times to attract more users. Initially set at 1%, the rate was increased to 3.3% and then to 8% to remain competitive. The 8% hike in August 2023 significantly boosted DAI’s supply, indicating the effectiveness of higher interest rates in attracting deposits.









However, the 8% rate was not sustainable, and a large portion of DAI was deposited into the DSR, triggering a drop to 5.8%. MakerDAO further reduced the rate to 5% to maintain a higher rate for a longer period.



Despite the attractive DSR, pressure emerged from alternative yield opportunities, such as USDe, offering a 15.9% yield on its staked offering, leading to some outflow from DAI.



In response to the decline, MakerDAO adjusted its fee mechanism and raised the DSR to 15% on March 9, 2024. This change appears to have stimulated the recent surge in DAI’s supply, as users rushed to capitalize on the high yield.

We asked ChatGPT-4o what will be XRP price at the end of 2024; Here’s what it said


Though XRP has not been a particularly active participant in the crypto market rally of the first quarter of 2024, things have been far from quiet for the cryptocurrency.
Indeed, much activity has emerged from Ripple Labs – XRP’s issuer – and has included significant monthly token unlocks, a reported entry into the stablecoin game, and perhaps most consequentially, the continuation of the long-standing legal battle with the Securities and Exchange Commission.
The courtroom fight is also, after many years, seemingly entering its final chapter, with Ripple recently filing a motion to seal certain sensitive business data. The outcome of the case is bound to be consequential and could help XRP, in particular, surge toward its previous all-time highs (ATH) near $3.


With the promise of pending regulatory clarity and the still-persistent uncertainty in mind, Finbold decided to consult the most advanced version of OpenAI’s flagship artificial intelligence (AI) platform – ChatGPT-4o – on where XPR might stand at the very end of 2024.
ChatGPT sets XRP price for late December 2024
Upon analyzing the recent crypto market trends and XRP-related happenings, ChatGPT concluded that the token is likely to see a significant rise in value through the rest of 2024.
According to the AI, the facts that a victory for Ripple is in the cards and that the company has actively been working on developing its ecosystem and partnerships are likely to help drive positive market action. 
ChatGPT, however, also reflected on mixed results of technical analysis (TA) assessing XRP’s recent performance and thus concluded that, between the likely positive developments and the current struggles, the token is likely to rise to $0.80 by the end of the year.
ChatGPT summarizes its assessment of XRP. Source: Finbold and ChatGPT
When challenged that its analysis appears low given that the AI assumed a legal victory for Ripple, ChatGPT pushed back, stating that the current market conditions – while allowing for a greater long-term surge – would still limit how much XRP can rise before 2024 is out and described its target of $0.80 as a ‘conservative but realistic estimate.’

ChatGPT presents a bullish scenario
ChatGPT was also willing to indulge in a more bullish sequence of events. In this scenario, a legal victory against the SEC would have a ripple effect that would cause wider user and institutional adoption across the globe, facilitate an unprecedented pace of innovation, and turn the market highly bullish.
Should such regulatory clarity be achieved, and should the stars align – a scenario the AI considers plausible, if not the most likely – XRP could soar to $3 per token by the end of 2024.
ChatGPT outlines its bullish case for XRP. Source: Finbold and ChatGPT
ChatGPT presents a bearish scenario
ChatGPT, however, also estimates a bearish scenario in which Ripple suffers a major legal defeat against the SEC is plausible.
Under these circumstances, the AI assesses, regulators across the world would feel emboldened to besiege the crypto industry and investors could, spooked by the developments, turn sour on cryptocurrencies.

These factors would, combined, also stifle further technological developments and ultimately lead to a crash to $0.15 for XRP by the end of 2024.

Shibarium Sees Transaction Fees Surge by 267% Amid Rising Interest in Shiba Inu Tokens



                    

Shibarium, the Layer-2 blockchain designed for the Shiba Inu community, has seen a dramatic increase in transaction fees, with a recorded 267% rise in the last 24 hours. 



According to Shibariumscan, the gas fees, paid using BONE—the native token of the Shiba Inu ecosystem—escalated from 11.57 to 30.98 BONE. 




This increase is primarily due to a surge in network activity, likely driven by a growing interest in Shiba Inu tokens following recent market shifts.



The Shiba Inu ecosystem, which uses BONE for transaction fees, is experiencing heightened transaction volumes. 



As a result, the cost for users has significantly increased. 




BONE not only facilitates transaction payments on Shibarium but also plays a key role in the ecosystem’s tokenomics. 



READ MORE: SEC Denies Coinbase’s Appeal in Ongoing Securities Lawsuit, Citing Manipulation of Legal Queries



Each transaction using BONE helps in burning SHIB tokens, as a portion of the BONE fee is converted into SHIB and sent to a dead wallet. 



This process reduces the total SHIB supply, potentially enhancing its scarcity and value.




This notable increase in fees raises several questions about the future of the Shiba Inu network and its tokens. 



Stakeholders are now contemplating whether the spike is indicative of a long-term trend of increased activity or if it’s a temporary surge. 



The sustainability of such high fees is also in question, as is Shibarium’s strategy to manage demand while maintaining network efficiency and scalability.



Additionally, the broader context includes recent integrations that have enabled Shiba Inu (SHIB) payments with major brands like Airbnb and Nike, expanding the token’s utility and exposure. 



However, the overall market sentiment remains bearish, creating an uncertain environment for SHIB and BONE investors. 



These developments suggest critical times ahead for Shibarium, as it must navigate through market fluctuations and user expectations to sustain growth and retain user engagement.

MicroStrategy Joins MSCI: Crypto Goes Mainstream


							

MicroStrategy joins MSCI World Stock Index, highlighting crypto’s role 



MSTR stock outperforms Bitcoin rally, seen as a Bitcoin proxy 



Analyst sentiment positive on MSTR despite recent pullback 




MicroStrategy, the company famous for its massive Bitcoin holdings has been added to the MSCI World Stock Index. This move reflects the increasing acceptance of cryptocurrency in the traditional investment portfolios. 



MicroStrategy’s strong Bitcoin advocacy is well-known. The company grabbed headlines during the pandemic by using a large portion of its cash reserves to buy Bitcoin. They currently hold 214,400 BTC at an average purchase price of $35,180 per bitcoin.



This inclusion comes amidst a stellar year for MicroStrategy stock (MSTR). Its price has quadrupled compared to last year, even outperforming the impressive Bitcoin rally by a significant margin. Earlier this year, when Bitcoin reached its peak, MSTR stock also surged to new highs. However, a recent market correction caused a pullback, leading to a price decrease of over 30% for MSTR.



Many investors viewed MicroStrategy stock as an indirect way to hold Bitcoin especially before the launch of spot Bitcoin ETFs this year. These new investment vehicles might challenge MicroStrategy’s dominance in offering Bitcoin exposure through the stock market. Additionally, some analysts believe that the stock is currently overvalued and have taken short positions against it.









Despite these concerns, analyst sentiment remains largely positive. The average 12-month price target for MSTR sits nearly 30% higher than its current price suggesting continued growth potential. The company’s inclusion to the MSCI index further strengthens its position in both the stock and crypto market as traditional and digital assets increasingly converge.

Solana-based Cypher developer confesses to gambling away $300K of user funds

Pseudonymous Cypher Protocol developer Hoak has confessed to stealing nearly $300,000 worth of user funds and gambling them away.The core developer of the Solana-based cross-margin decentralized exchange (DEX) admitted his wrongdoing in a public statement shared in a May 14 X post:“To address the elephant in the room, the allegations are true, I took the funds and gambled them away. I didn’t run away with it, nor did anyone else.”Hoak’s confession follows a revelation by the pseudonymous core contributor Barrett_io the day prior regarding the absence of funds in a post on May 13th.The post went unnoticed until an unknown Discord group member shed light on experiencing fund withdrawal issues. According to Barrett:“Hoak has stolen funds from the cypher redemption contract. This happened over months via 36 withdraws… Deployer wallet (ETR8…) withdraws funds from Cypher’s redemption contract. Then conducts swaps and sends SOL, USDC, and USDT to an intermediary wallet (7sKM…).

Sonne Finance Loses $20M to “Known Donation Attack” - DailyCoin


        

Sonne Finance has been exploited.



Assets worth millions of dollars were stolen following the attack.



The protocol has initiated the recovery process.




Sonne Finance has lost millions of dollars to a “known donation attack” on its Compound v2 forks on Arbitrum, the protocol announced on Wednesday.



Launched in September 2022, Sonne Finance brands itself as a decentralized, non-custodial liquidity market protocol on Optimism Mainnet and Base. The protocol allows users to deposit their assets as collateral for borrowing various assets against them, including WBTC, WETH, USDT, USDC, and DAI.



Sonne Finance Suffers an Attack



On May 15, blockchain security firm Cyvers alerted the X (Twitter) crypto community to an attack on Sonne Finance, estimating that $3 million had been stolen from the protocol’s USDC and WETH contracts.




Without directly addressing the issue, the Sonne Finance team informed its users two hours later that “all markets on Optimism have been paused,” urging them to stay tuned for more updates.







Hours after its first update, Sonne Finance issued a detailed post-mortem of the incident, noting that the attacker had exploited four of the multiple transactions scheduled by the protocol on May 12 as part of its plan to integrate VELO markets.



“After the execution of the markets without us noticing, the attacker was able to exploit the protocol for ~$20M with the known donation attack,” the Sonne Finance team wrote.



Noting that it became aware of the incident 25 minutes later, Sonne Finance said it had assembled a “war room” to investigate the exploiter’s identity to recover the stolen funds.




“We are ready to give bounty to exploiter as well as not to commit pursuing the issue further, in case of returning the funds.” The protocol said.



Per the post-mortem report, besides doing everything in its “power,” Sonne Finance is in “contact with anyone that can help with recovering the funds.”

BTC Settles at $62K Ahead of US CPI Numbers, FLOKI Skyrockets 14% (Market Watch)


																Bitcoin’s price faced enhanced volatility yesterday morning and later on during the day, but the asset has calmed at around $62,000 ahead of the April US CPI numbers.
Most altcoins are in the red now, though, with ETH declining to $2,900 and BNB losing more than 3% of value.
BTC Calms at $62K
The primary cryptocurrency had a controversial end to the previous week as it had soared to almost $64,000 on Friday when a rapid and violent correction brought it south by more than three grand. As a result, the asset fell to $60,150 at the end of the day.
The bulls managed to intercept the move and didn’t allow a price drop to under $60,000. Just the opposite, BTC reclaimed some ground during the weekend and stood primarily around $61,000. Monday saw a more impressive price increase that pushed bitcoin to just over $63,400.
However, the cryptocurrency failed to maintain its run and dropped back down to $61,200 amid some Coinbase issues. More volatility ensued during the day, but BTC has climbed slightly to just over $62,000 now. More fluctuations are expected later today as the US CPI numbers for April will be announced in a few hours.

FLOKI Keeps Pumping
Several meme coins charted impressive gains yesterday, and the landscape for a few of them has only gotten better. FLOKI is today’s top performer from the largest 100 crypto assets, having soared by about 14%. As a result, the meme coin now trades at $0.00022.
Pepe (5%) and AR (6%) follow suit, while WLD (-8%), ENA (-8%), TIA (-7%), WIF (-5%), and STX (-5%) have lost the most value within the same timeframe.
BNB, DOGE, ADA, SOL, and AVAX have declined the most from the larger-cap alts, while ETH is close to breaking below $2,900 after another minor correction.
The total crypto market cap has remained at almost the same spot as yesterday, at just under $2.4 trillion.

Solana (SOL) Beats Ethereum for First Time in History, But There's a Catch

On May 12, Solana generated more Total Economic Value (TEV) than Ethereum in a single day. This marks the first time Solana has outpaced Ethereum in its history, but there is always a catch.Breaking down the dataAccording to Blockworks Research, Solana generated $2,248,681 in TEV on May 12, surpassing Ethereum's $1,977,416. TEV combines transaction fees and miner/extractor value (MEV). TEV is often used to analyze the utility and adoption of a blockchain network. Chris Burniske, the former Ark Invest analyst, commented on the whole thing, stating that we should keep an eye on L1s that are keeping up their annual expansion in the form of TEV.  Higher TEV can indicate greater usage and demand, which can, in turn, provide more flexibility in the economic policies of the network.There's a problemHowever, the achievement has sparked some debate between Solana and Ethereum users. Critics argue that comparing Solana's TEV with Ethereum's without considering layer-2 (L2) solutions is misleading. L2 solutions are built on top of Ethereum to enhance scalability and reduce fees, effectively offloading some of the activity from the main Ethereum blockchain (L1), while remaining a crucial part of it. As one commentator pointed out, "Since some ETH activity has moved to L2s, wouldn't we include that? Come on Chris, this is just disingenuous if you don’t take L2s into account."Despite the criticism, comparing TEV across blockchains remains valuable. As Burniske explained, each L2 operates in its own blockspace environment, and TEV comparisons are typically made on an L1-to-L1 basis. However, some may disagree with such an approach and consider L2s an inseparable part of larger ecosystems like Ethereum, which has struggled due to high fees in the past. For now, Ethereum fees sometimes drop even below Tron's.

PEPE's Market Cap Eyes $5 Billion After the Price Hit Another ATH


																TL;DR

Pepe (PEPE) has recently soared to an all-time high, achieving a market capitalization of nearly $5 billion.
Despite its inherent risks due to volatility, PEPE has garnered significant support from key figures in the cryptocurrency world and major exchanges, leading to substantial profits for its investors.


PEPE Solidifies the Status of a Top Meme Coin
The frog-themed meme coin – Pepe (PEPE) – has been crypto’s rock start in the past few days, with its price soaring by approximately 100% on a monthly scale. It hit a fresh all-time high today (May 15), whereas its market capitalization pumped to almost $5 billion. The progress is quite significant considering the fact that the figure stood at around $500 million at the start of the year.

PEPE Market Cap, Source: CoinGecko
The latest ascent solidified PEPE as the third-largest cryptocurrency in the meme coin realm. Shiba Inu (SHIB) is second with a market cap of $14 billion, while Dogecoin (DOGE) leads the pack with over $21 billion.
Somewhat expectedly, PEPE’s resurgence has benefited investors. According to IntoTheBlock, 100% of the coin’s holders stood at paper profits several hours ago. Currently, the percentage is just as impressive, pointing at 98%.
PEPE’s Success in the Past Year
The meme coin, built on the Ethereum blockchain, saw the light of day in April 2023, catching the eye of industry participants almost immediately. 




It received support from prominent figures in the crypto community while leading exchanges enabled trading services with it. Binance, Coinbase, OKX, Bybit, and Bitget are some notable examples that embraced PEPE. 
The asset also allowed savvy traders to make multi-million profits. However, people should also keep in mind that tokens of that type can also be quite risky due to their volatile nature, potentially leading to devastating losses.

Crypto expert PlanB reveals when Bitcoin will ‘go vertical’


With the majority of assets in the cryptocurrency sector slowing down their gains, including the market’s representative, Bitcoin (BTC), the situation may soon change, particularly as Bitcoin miner revenue recovers, according to the observations of a renowned crypto trading expert.
Specifically, the historical trends show that Bitcoin miner revenue tends to recover in two to five months after the halving, and after that, the price of Bitcoin “goes vertical” as the crypto analyst and creator of the stock-to-flow (S2F) model in predicting Bitcoin’s price, PlanB pointed out in an X post on May 14.

Indeed, monthly Bitcoin miner revenue has consistently grown over time and has recorded peaks in the months following the halving event, coinciding with a high relative strength index (RSI), which has tended to increase alongside revenue and then drop to below 70 as it consolidates – generally a bullish sign.


BTC price prediction
Earlier, PlanB offered his views regarding the price of the maiden crypto asset for the next several years, refreshing the S2F model with new data that places an average price of Bitcoin for the 2024-2028 halving cycle at $500,000, with the following cycle, 2028-2032, looking at a whopping $4 million.
In terms of Bitcoin’s price this year, the analyst has expressed confidence in the flagship decentralized finance (DeFi) asset hitting $100,000 in the second half of 2024, driven by the tendency of mining revenue to recover following the halving event, with the market peak expected in 2025.
Bitcoin price analysis
For now, Bitcoin is changing hands at the price of $62,120, recording a modest gain of 0.43% in the last 24 hours while still writing down a loss of 0.33% across the previous seven days and an accumulated decline of 6.31% on its monthly chart, as per the latest data on May 15.

All things considered, experts’ opinions and historical trends are all working in Bitcoin’s favor, and its price might, indeed, follow this set path. However, the situation in the crypto industry can sometimes take a surprising turn, so doing one’s own research is critical when investing.

Circle Shifts Headquarters to US Before Upcoming IPO


Circle Internet Financial Ltd., the issuer of the USDC stablecoin, is making a strategic move to re-domicile its legal base. The company plans to move its legal headquarters from the Republic of Ireland to the United States (US).
This decision comes ahead of its highly anticipated initial public offering (IPO). Many see this move as a significant shift for the company as it navigates the regulatory environment and seeks to bolster market confidence.
Moving to the US Might Pose Challenges for Circle
A Bloomberg report recently shared a confirmation from a Circle spokesperson. They confirmed the filing of necessary court paperwork for the move on Tuesday. However, they did not share the reasons for the decision.
BeInCrypto previously reported that Circle had already filed for the IPO to the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) in January. Yet, the company did not disclose the number of shares it plans to dilute or the price range of its shares.

On the other hand, moving to the US may pose challenges for Circle, including stricter taxes and a complex regulatory scene. Indeed, the regulation of cryptocurrencies and stablecoins in the US has been uncertain.

Notably, Ripple Labs, the company behind the XRP cryptocurrency, has faced significant legal challenges with the SEC. This challenge caused Ripple to halt its IPO plans in the US and consider alternatives abroad.
Therefore, Circle’s move suggests a strategic bet on regulatory clarity in the US. Depending on upcoming regulatory decisions, this could either boost or hinder its growth.
Despite potential obstacles, Circle’s CEO, Jeremy Allaire, remains optimistic about the future of stablecoins and their regulatory environment. At the Milken Institute Global Conference 2024, Allaire emphasized the importance of regulatory clarity, scalable technology, and user-friendly applications to widen USDC adoption and integration.


“I’ve always said you need regulatory clarity. You need the technology to become much more scalable and useable. And then, you need the people, the mainstream applications that people are going to be interacting with this, whether you are a business accepting a payment or an end user, you need those to connect up to that. All those three have been happening. We’re getting regulatory clarity on payment stablecoins all around the world and almost every jurisdiction we have a payment stablecoin act that’s at the proverbial one yard line here in the US,” Allaire said.


VIDEO

Allaire’s confidence is further evidenced by Circle’s collaborations with traditional finance giants such as BlackRock. Last month, Circle announced a new exchange feature for BlackRock’s USD Institutional Digital Liquidity Fund (BUIDL) investors. They can now exchange their tokenized real-world assets for USDC.
According to CoinGecko data, USDC is the second-largest stablecoin in terms of market capitalization. As of May 15, USDC has a market capitalization of $32.86 billion. 

This represents nearly 21% of the stablecoin market share. It trails behind Tether’s USDT, which has a market capitalization of $110.86 billion and a 70.75% market share.

In 2022, USDC and USDT were in close competition. In July 2022, USDC held over 40% of the market share, compared to USDT’s roughly 50%.
However, 2023 brought challenges for Circle, particularly due to banking issues in the US. Part of USDC’s reserves were held with Silicon Valley Bank, which faced financial troubles. This caused USDC to temporarily lose its peg, raising concerns among users and investors.
As Circle prepares for its IPO and re-domiciles to the US, its actions reflect a strategic pivot to align with US financial regulations and market dynamics. With its strong industry partnerships and commitment to regulatory clarity, this move also positions Circle to strengthen its place in the stablecoin market.

Ripple Bolsters Position As A Digital Asset Custody Provider


								Ripple is transitioning into a full-service digital asset custody provider, following its acquisition of Metaco, a Swiss-based leader in the sector, for $250 million in May 2023. This development represents a significant expansion of the fintech’s capabilities into the institutional crypto custody market—a segment that is expected to experience substantial growth over the next decade.
Integration Of Metaco’s Solutions On Ripple’s Platform
The integration of Metaco’s offerings into Ripple’s services was formally announced via X. In a statement shared on the platform, Metaco declared, “All Metaco updates and news for institutional-grade custody solutions can now be found on Ripple. This move allows us to better connect with our community and provide even more valuable insights.” This move underscores a strategic alignment and integration of technologies and services between the two companies.


A prominent figure within the XRP community, WrathofKahneman, highlighted the implications of this integration by stating, “And there we are. The web frontend for Metaco is now Ripple’s ‘Institutional Digital Asset Custody Platform’ page. Gets interesting from here!”

The integration raised several questions within the community regarding its impact on different investor classes and the overall strategy. Addressing these concerns, WrathofKahneman speculated, “At face value, it doesn’t add too much new information; we knew Ripple acquired Metaco. It suggests to me the key role licensed custody plays in Ripple’s plans moving forward, so much so that despite initial claims, they seem to increasingly integrate (absorb) Metaco.”
Chad Steingraber, another prominent community member, further emphasized the significance of this shift, remarking, “Ripple is now a complete Digital Asset Custody Service.” This reflects a general consensus that the company has evolved from its origins as a payment protocol to a more diverse financial technology platform offering institutional-grade digital asset services.
The new subpage offers a comprehensive outline of the service capabilities: “Access the entire digital asset ecosystem today. Scale bespoke business models in new markets with the digital asset economy. Custody is critical to unlocking value, addressing growing demand for new asset classes, and building novel use cases across asset tokenization, stablecoin issuance, trading, staking and beyond.”

It further details the benefits of their institutional-grade custody platform, focusing on security and compliance, agility and flexibility, and connectivity and networks. These features are designed to provide “the ultimate level of private key protection, scalable governance across all operations, and sole control over data and processes,” thereby positioning Ripple as a key player in the rapidly evolving digital asset market.
The acquisition of Metaco not only expands Ripple’s technological base but also aligns with its strategic objectives to dominate the growing market of crypto services for enterprises. Metaco’s flagship product, Harmonize, is a benchmark in digital asset custody and tokenization, widely utilized by leading custodians, banks, and financial institutions globally.
Despite the acquisition, Ripple announced last year that Metaco will continue to operate as an independent brand and business unit under the leadership of its founder and CEO, Adrien Treccani. However, the latest announcement seems to be a slight shift from this strategy.
At press time, XRP traded at $0.49824.

Solana DEX Developer Admits To Stealing And Gambling Away $300M Meant For Hack Victims: 'I F***ed Up Way Too Hard' - Benzinga

A core developer working for Solana-based SOL/USD decentralized exchange, Cypher, admitted to misappropriating funds worth more than $300 million meant to compensate victims of a sensational hack on the platform last year.What Happened: In a public statement shared on X, the developer, under the alias “Hoak,” said, "To address the elephant in the room, the allegations are true, I took the funds and gambled them away." "I would like to deeply apologize to all affected parties, I know at this point nothing is going to take back my actions and I have to face the consequences," the regretful developer added.“TLDR: I fucked up way too hard, way too many times. I don't expect anyone to forgive me or let this go unpunished,” he said on X.The public acknowledgment of their crimes comes a day after another core contributor at the now-collapsed protocol accused Hoak of stealing redemption funds."This is incredibly saddening to me. I never thought this would be a possibility,  having a core contributor who stayed on after the exploit to try and rebuild the project be the one who rugged funds from the redemption contract," the developer with the pseudonym "Cobra" claimed. Cobra revealed that the crime had been happening for months, and said they would pursue legal action against Hoak.Why It Matters: Cypher, a trading platform on the Solana blockchain, was robbed of more than $1 million in cryptocurrencies last August after a hacker exploited a bug in the protocol, according to DeFiLlama. The hacking incident and subsequent defrauding by its own members raised concerns over the lack of integrity of those working in the ecosystem. However, timely tracking by on-chain sleuths raised hopes that such foul play would eventually be uncovered.Price Action: At the time of writing, SOL was exchanging hands at $143.64, following a 1.88% decline in the last 24 hours, according to data from Benzinga Pro.Read Next: GameStop Might Have Outperformed Bitcoin’s Yearly Returns In A Single Day But Here’s Why King Crypto Evokes More Optimism

Robinhood Crypto launches Solana staking with 5% APY for EU users - Crypto Briefing




Robinhood’s European crypto branch has introduced Solana staking for its customers, offering an annual percentage yield (APY) of approximately 5% at launch.According to Johann Kerbrat, general manager of Robinhood Crypto, the actual yield may vary as staking rewards change over time. The 5% APY offered by Robinhood Crypto is slightly lower than Coinbase’s estimated reward of 5.42% for Solana stakers.Notably, one of the highest annual yields for staking Solana can be accessed through Phantom wallet, a self-custodial Web3 wallet that offers up to 7.58% APY. According to Robinhood, the decision to launch Solana for its first staking product is largely influenced by the popularity of the SOL token among its EU users.Robinhood noted that the staking process in Solana is simpler compared to Ethereum, while also having a shorter bonding period for newly-staked assets to earn yield. For context, Solana has a bonding period that completes within two days, in contrast to Ethereum’s variable period which ranges from days to a few weeks.Asked about its plans to add staking for other assets, Kerbrat said that Robinhood is considering the offerings.Robinhood Crypto, which launched in December as a crypto trading app in the European Union, is registered and regulated in Lithuania. The company’s crypto arm noted that its app is highly downloaded by users in Poland, Italy, and Lithuania. Robinhood Crypto lists 33 tokens, compared to the US trading app, which only offers 15 crypto assets, with even fewer available in New York and Texas.The EU platform also offers SOL and Solana memecoins like BONK and DogWifHat, which are not available in the US. Robinhood’s US arm delisted Solana and other cryptocurrencies alleged by the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to be unregistered securities in June of last year, following the agency’s lawsuits against Coinbase and Binance.Despite Robinhood receiving a Wells Notice from the US SEC last week regarding its crypto listings, Kerbrat maintains that Robinhood and Robinhood’s EU crypto branch operate separately and have different business models.

Bitcoin and Ethereum Steady Ahead of U.S. Consumer Prices Report - Decrypt

We do the research, you get the alpha!Get exclusive reports and access to key insights on airdrops, NFTs, and more! Subscribe now to Alpha Reports and up your game!Go to Alpha ReportsBitcoin and Ethereum, the two largest cryptocurrencies by market capitalization, were steady hours heading into another U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics consumer prices report.The new Consumer Price Index report will be released at 8:30 a.m. EST. For now, things seem pretty tame in crypto markets.Bitcoin price sitting just above $62,000—up 0.6% compared to the same time yesterday. And the Ethereum price, which had sunk to around $2,900, was down 0.2% since Tuesday morning, according to CoinGecko data.Economists have been forecasting that the market is in for another disappointingly high Consumer Price Index report today. The CPI is one of the key metrics that the Federal Reserve uses to determine whether it should lower the federal interest rate. But analysts have flagged that gas prices have been on the rise and prices have been inching upwards in the services sectors.It's bad, but not necessarily terrible news, Michael Pugliese, senior economist at Wells Fargo, told Morningstar.“The trajectory is still down," he said, "but it’s been a more gradual downward move relative to the expectations coming into 2024.”When the BLS issued its March Consumer Price Index report last month, it showed that personal expenditures in the U.S. had grown by 3.7%. The news that the U.S. economy had been growing slower than expected caused BTC and ETH to dip.Bitcoin started the month having sunk below $60,000, briefly touched $65,000, and triggered the liquidation of hundreds of millions worth of derivatives positions along the way. More recently, the mix of macroeconomic factors—including the war in Israel's War on Gaza and slowed growth in major economies like the U.S.—has sparked pessimism in crypto markets.But there's a little good news: Bitcoin billionaire Arthur Hayes said earlier this month that the bottom for BTC is already in."I expect prices to bottom, chop, and begin a slow grind higher," he wrote in a recent blog post. But he noted that he wasn't planning to add more Bitcoin to his bags."The recent intense puke out provides an excellent opportunity to unstake my USDe and spend synthetic dollars on high beta shitcoins," Hayes said.

Spot Bitcoin ETF: Here's Why Vanguard Might Finally Join BlackRock

The spot Bitcoin ETF ecosystem may soon get a new mega backer in Vanguard. Though speculative, the $7.7 trillion investment management company might chart a new era, seeing as it just named a new chief executive officer (CEO), Salim Ramji. Ramji is set to replace Tim Buckley, the leader who resisted the urge to embrace Bitcoin ETFs.Salim has quite a pedigree, and he joins Vanguard from BlackRock, where his last role involved overseeing the launch of BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT). On several occasions, Salim Ramji was caught expressing his perception of Bitcoin and the need to embrace new technologies on all fronts. BlackRock’s IBIT led the spot Bitcoin ETF inflows since the product’s inception in January. Notably, Ramji has seen the potency of the product, and he might help overhaul how Vanguard embraces the product moving forward. The anti-Bitcoin culture at Vanguard is striking. Besides refusing to join the host of applicants for spot Bitcoin ETFs, the company also discontinued support for its trading on all of its supported platforms. Former CEO Buckley even hinted that the firm’s position against Bitcoin will outlive his tenure, adding a unique twist to the conversation.Major financial giants in the country and abroad are joining the Bitcoin ETF bandwagon. Besides BlackRock, top banks like Morgan Stanley and UBS have unveiled their exposure to the asset class. Besides these two, top trading firm Susquehanna International Group has also revealed that it holds up to $1 billion spread across several spot Bitcoin ETF issuers.Entities in Canada and Hong Kong have also unveiled disclosures on Bitcoin through recent 13F filings with the U.S. SEC. With these trends, it becomes evident that there is a major shift to these products, complimenting MicroStrategy’s aggressive accumulation spirit. While Vanguard is not losing out on the Bitcoin ETF hype, with Ramji as head of Vanguard, he might be unwilling to let go of the opportunity to invest in BTC.

That said, the event organizers have confirmed that additional bonuses may be provided by event sponsors.“Fostering a competitive scene for Apeiron is crucial,” Frank Cheng, CEO of Apeiron developer Foonie Magus, told Decrypt. “By cultivating a competitive environment through tournaments and live streams, we not only keep existing players engaged but also drive mass adoption by showcasing the game's depth and excitement to a broader audience.”We've seen various attempts by crypto games to build out sustainable esports scenes, with monster-battling game Axie Infinity holding events and funding community promotions, while card game Parallel is pumping $500,000 into future events.Fantasy Top recently gave out rewards that, if analysts are right, could be worth millions of dollars—but the game demands a rich understanding of Crypto Twitter and the surrounding culture. Apeiron’s vision is to rival the Web2 esports scene.“If you look at Web2 esports, it's been challenging to find a way for it to be sustainable. From our perspective, our robust Web3 tokenized economy completes a positive feedback loop with our competitive scene,” Cheng said. “Players come in to compete, thereby stimulating the economy which then itself provides the resources to make the competitive events happen. Our goal is to kick-start this loop with big events such as the Apeiron Guild Wars 2024.”Most games with a thriving esports scene and million dollar prize pools have had years of community building and game balancing to solidify it as a competitive sport—but not Apeiron. Instead, the game is only in open beta and players are still figuring out its mechanics. That's an added challenge for the team.“Our game designers and developers are invested and skilled players of the game themselves, and have a strong grasp of the ‘meta’ with the internal data metrics to back up their opinions,” Cheng told Decrypt. “They will be monitoring the game’s balance up until the tournament begins to make sure that there are no strategic outliers.”As a relatively new game, however, that provides an opportunity for dedicated players to commit time to Apeiron and establish themselves as one of the best, possibly making their way into Apeiron Guild Wars 2024.Preliminary rounds for the tournament will begin May 21, finishing June 25. Guilds will compete for a slot in a Guild PvP online leaderboard which will run until July 2nd with additional invitational tournaments taking place later in July. The top 12 guilds will advance to Apeiron Guild Wars 2024.Edited by Andrew HaywardStay on top of crypto news, get daily updates in your inbox.

Bitget Wallet launches $10M ecosystem fund alongside Onchain Layer

Crypto exchange Bitget is looking to create its own on-chain ecosystem by following the footsteps of exchanges such as Binance, OKX and KuCoin. “The Bitget Onchain Layer will not only integrate a host of native DApps [decentralized applications] within Bitget Wallet through joint collaboration with builders,” according to a Bitget statement shared with Cointelegraph on May 15. “Concurrently, a $10 million BWB Ecosystem Fund has also been established, dedicated to accelerating the development of the Bitget Onchain Layer and supporting aligned projects,” it added.BWB is the native token of the exchange’s namesake self-custody wallet analogous to the Trust Wallet token (TWT). Meanwhile, the exchange itself also has a native token, BGB, which can be used to offset trading fees similar to Binance’s BNB (BNB) token, KuCoin’s KCS token and OKX’s OKB token. Initially, the Bitget OnChain Layer Ecosystem Fund will be dedicated to investing in and incubating various Web3 trading services. There are currently three pre-market price aggregators, an on-chain derivatives market and trading bots that will complement Bitget Wallet’s interchain swap service, according to the exchange. Bitget Wallet is currently one of the more popular self-custody wallets in the Asia-Pacific region, with over 20 million users. The wallet’s native token, BWB, is scheduled for launch this quarter, with 5% of its 1 billion maximum supply reserved for community members in its pre-generation event. After launch, BWB will power the Bitget Wallet and OnChain Layer ecosystem through governance voting, eligibility for participation in Launchpad events, staking rewards and payment of multichain gas fees. The Bitget OnChain Layer and its ecosystem. Source: BitgetThe move follows Bitget’s efforts to facilitate day-to-day trading and expand to all aspects of the crypto ecosystem. Binance, the world’s largest crypto exchange, first launched its own BNB blockchain in September 2020. Around the same time, Trust Wallet — created by Binance and now a separate legal entity — launched its own TWT token, which has since surpassed a fully diluted market cap of $1 billion. In 2021, the decentralized exchange PancakeSwap became the first billion-dollar project on the BNB Chain. Similarly, crypto exchange OKX has built its own self-custody wallet and Web3 Marketplace for trading nonfungible tokens, interacting with decentralized applications, and trading novel inventions such as Bitcoin Runes, Ordinals, Atomicals and BRC-20 tokens. On May 13, the OKX Web3 Marketplace became the largest exchange for trading Bitcoin Runes, with a 51.08% market share. Related: Bybit to launch Notcoin trading and withdrawals next week

Cahill Gordon & Reindel Beefs Up Crypto Practice, Adds 3 Crypto-Native Lawyers Including Lewis Cohen

“One of the big frustrations for clients is that they don’t really have a one-stop shop that they can go to to find crypto-native lawyers who speak the language, understand the technology,” Enzer said. “What you have is a tax crypto expert here, a crypto litigator there, a securities crypto expert at this place – it makes it very difficult for clients and more expensive, frankly, because they end up having to retain multiple law firms to get what they need.”

Notcoin: Stake BNB and FDUSD to Farm $NOT Tokens


			Notcoin, a viral Telegram-based game, has successfully onboarded millions of users into the world of Web3.
This straightforward gameplay resonated with users, leading to a peak of six million daily active users and a total player base of 35 million.
This article delves into what Notcoin is, how it works, and the exciting opportunities it offers, including staking BNB and FDUSD to farm Notcoin tokens ($NOT).
In Notcoin, players earn in-game currency by tapping on a gold coin within the Telegram app. The energy required to tap the coin depletes and refills over time, preventing continuous gameplay without breaks. Players can invite friends to join the game, enhancing their experience and potentially increasing their earnings. The game features a global leaderboard, divided into tiers from Silver to Diamond, where players can see how they rank against others worldwide.
Boosts and Power-ups
To increase their earning potential, players can use various boosts or power-ups. These include daily refreshable boosts like “Full Energy” and “Turbo” boosts, as well as permanent boosts purchasable with Notcoin. These power-ups allow players to earn more coins per tap and extend their energy capacity. An Auto-Tap bot is also available, collecting coins on behalf of the player even when they are not actively playing.
Cosmetic Upgrades
Players can spend their earned Notcoin on cosmetic upgrades, changing the appearance of the game’s background or the coin they are tapping. These customizations add a fun and personalized element to the game.
The NOT Token
The excitement around Notcoin isn’t just about the game itself but also the upcoming launch of the $NOT token. The NOT token will be listed on The Open Network (TON), which was originally founded by Telegram. The total supply of $NOT is 102,719,221,714, with the entire supply expected to be in circulation upon listing.
Token Distribution and Fairness
One of the unique aspects of Notcoin is its approach to token distribution. All $NOT tokens will be awarded to players who earned Notcoin through the tap-to-earn game.
This method ensures a fair distribution, avoiding the creation of early whales typically seen in other cryptocurrency projects. While 100% circulation upon listing is planned, not all tokens will immediately enter trading, as some may remain unclaimed or locked in allocations.

Ecosystem Contributions
Notcoin encourages community participation and contribution. Players can earn $NOT by exploring Web3 products, playing new games, and adding value to the ecosystem. Additionally, Web3 builders can offer their products to the community through Notcoin campaigns, fostering a collaborative and growth-oriented environment.
Staking BNB and FDUSD to Farm $NOT
Binance has announced the listing of $NOT on its platform, providing users with the opportunity to stake BNB and FDUSD to farm Notcoin tokens. This initiative is part of Binance’s 54th Launchpool project, allowing users to earn rewards by participating in the staking pools.
Staking Details

Farming Period: 2024-05-13 00:00 (UTC) to 2024-05-15 23:59 (UTC)

To participate in the Notcoin airdrop and staking, visit Binance and stake your BNB or FDUSD. Remember to do your research and ensure the safety of your funds.

Binance Megadrop
In addition to staking BNB and FDUSD to earn $NOT tokens, users can also participate in Binance’s new Megadrop concept. The Binance Megadrop is designed to reward loyal BNB stakers with tokens from future projects listed on Binance Launchpool.
By staking BNB for extended periods, preferably 120+ days, users enhance their eligibility for these airdrops, gaining early access to promising new tokens and maximizing their potential rewards.

What is Binance Megadrop?
The Binance Megadrop allows users to stake BNB for extended periods to increase their chances of receiving airdrops from future projects. This innovative concept is aimed at rewarding loyal Binance users and providing them with early access to new tokens.
Increasing Your Chances with Binance Megadrop
By staking BNB, users not only earn $NOT tokens but also increase their chances in the Binance Megadrop. This approach allows users to benefit from both immediate rewards and long-term potential through future airdrops.
Personal Opinions and Predictions
Given the innovative nature of Notcoin and its fair distribution model, the $NOT token has significant potential. The project’s engagement strategy and large user base provide a solid foundation for future growth.
Binance will be the first platform to list the $NOT token, with trading starting on May 16, 2024. Players who earned Notcoin in the game will receive an airdrop of the real $NOT token, creating an exciting bridge between the virtual and real-world value.
Pre-market Vouchers
Before the airdrop, Notcoin introduced an NFT voucher program, allowing players with over 10 million Notcoin to convert their earnings into NFT vouchers. These vouchers can be bought, sold, or traded before the $NOT token launch, providing a speculative market for early adopters.
The Future of Notcoin
With the mining phase of the game ending on April 1, Notcoin is poised for a significant evolution. The game will return after the token launch with new gameplay mechanics and reduced rewards. Companies looking to gain exposure to Notcoin’s large audience will need to buy $NOT on the open market and use it to activate features within the game.
Potential Additions and Changes
Open Builders, the creators of Notcoin, plan to enhance the game with additional features, such as a trading bot for buying and selling crypto tokens via Telegram. The goal is to create a more visual and user-friendly interface compared to existing text-based trading bots.
Community and Ecosystem Growth
Notcoin’s model emphasizes community involvement and ecosystem growth. By allowing users to earn $NOT through various activities and encouraging Web3 builders to engage with the community, Notcoin aims to create a vibrant and sustainable ecosystem.
Opinions and Predictions
Given the innovative nature of Notcoin and its fair distribution model, the $NOT token has significant potential. The project’s engagement strategy and large user base provide a solid foundation for future growth.
Price Predictions:

Listing ATH Price: $0.002 – $0.003
Market Cap: $400M – $500M

As the ecosystem develops and more use cases for $NOT emerge, the token could see substantial appreciation in value.

Colony Lab launches a “Liquid Vesting” platform to democratize early-stage crypto investments


Colony Lab, a community-driven accelerator for the Avalanche (AVAX) ecosystem, has unveiled a new decentralized fundraising platform poised to revolutionize access to seed investments in early-stage crypto projects, according to the latest information shared with Finbold on May 15. 
Historically limited to the realm of venture capitalists and high-net-worth individuals, these opportunities are now open to a broader audience, thanks to Colony Lab’s innovative approach.

Liquid Vesting on Colony Labs
A standout feature of the new platform is “Liquid Vesting,” a pioneering concept in the world of cryptocurrencies. 


This feature gives investors unprecedented ability to trade their locked or vesting tokens on Colony’s decentralized exchange (DEX) during the lockup period. 
With the new model, Liquid Vesting ensures that users can freely trade their tokens before they are fully vested, without affecting the secondary market. 
Naturally, all transactions occur on-chain, maintaining a high level of transparency and security.
Democratizing crypto with seed sales
Elie Le Rest, CEO and Co-Founder of Colony Lab, shared the vision behind these advancements: 

“When we developed the platform and the ‘Liquid Vesting’ feature, our aim was to make investing in crypto simple and flexible for everyone. We hope these enhancements will create more opportunities for early investors and improve liquidity in the primary market. Our goal is to transform investment practices in the blockchain world by prioritizing clarity, security, and openness. Colony Lab is at the forefront of making early-stage investments more dynamic and accessible.”

After two years of dedicated development, Colony Lab’s platform and Liquid Vesting feature now enable users to invest directly in seed sales from the outset. 
This initiative introduces much-needed liquidity to the primary market, broadening access to early-stage investments and fostering a more inclusive investment environment.
Colony Lab’s community, with over 8,000 active users and a collective net worth of $200 million, stands to benefit from these innovative features. 
The launch thus marks a significant milestone in making early-stage crypto investments accessible to a wider audience, reinforcing Colony Lab’s position as a market leader.

Notcoin: A Deep Dive into the Community Token and Staking Opportunities | Bitcoinist.com


								Notcoin started as a viral Telegram game that introduced millions to the world of web3 through a unique tap-to-earn mining mechanic.
As a community token, $NOT aims to foster engagement, play, and contribution within its ecosystem. With the upcoming launch on Binance Launchpool, users can stake BNB and FDUSD to farm Notcoin tokens, making it an exciting opportunity for crypto enthusiasts.
This article will explore the origins, mechanics, and future prospects of Notcoin, as well as the specifics of the staking process on Binance.
Origins of Notcoin
Notcoin emerged as a simple yet addictive game within the Telegram messaging app. Developed by Open Builders, the game invited users to tap a golden coin displayed on their screens to earn an in-game currency called Notcoin.
This tap-to-earn mechanism quickly gained traction, attracting 35 million total players and peaking at six million daily active users. The game’s success can be attributed to its straightforward gameplay, community engagement, and the promise of future crypto rewards.
Gameplay Mechanics
Players begin by opening the Telegram app and tapping the Notcoin bot. A golden coin appears on the screen, which players tap to earn Notcoin. Energy depletes with each tap and refills slowly over time, preventing endless clicking.
Players can boost their earnings through daily “Full Energy” and “Turbo” boosts or by purchasing permanent boosts with Notcoin.
Additionally, players climb a global leaderboard divided into tiers, from Silver to Diamond league. Completing quests, such as following a Twitter account or joining a Telegram community, also earns extra tokens. Cosmetic upgrades, like changing the game’s background or the appearance of the coin, can be purchased with Notcoin, enhancing the user experience.
Transition to $NOT Token
The culmination of Notcoin’s in-game efforts is the transition to the $NOT token, set to launch on The Open Network (TON). Unlike many crypto projects with early whales, Notcoin aims for fair distribution by airdropping 100% of the $NOT tokens to the community.
The total supply of $NOT is 102,719,221,714, with an equal circulating supply upon listing. However, this does not mean all tokens will immediately enter trading; unclaimed airdrops and other allocations will gradually enter the secondary market.

Staking BNB and FDUSD to Farm Notcoin Tokens
As part of the Binance Launchpool, users can stake BNB and FDUSD to farm $NOT tokens. The staking process is simple and rewards participants with a significant portion of the total token supply. Here are the details:
Staking Period and Rewards

Farming Period: May 13, 2024, 00:00 (UTC) to May 15, 2024, 23:59 (UTC).
Total Rewards: 3,081,576,650 NOT tokens.

Stake BNB: 2,619,340,153 NOT (85% of rewards).
Stake FDUSD: 462,236,497 NOT (15% of rewards).



How to Participate

Register on Binance: Create an account on Binance using the referral link: Binance Registration.
Stake BNB or FDUSD: Visit the Launchpool webpage (available 24 hours before the farming starts) and stake your BNB or FDUSD.
Earn Rewards: Tokens will be distributed daily based on the amount of BNB or FDUSD staked.

Listing on Binance
After the farming period, $NOT will be listed on Binance on May 16, 2024, at 12:00 (UTC). Trading pairs will include NOT/BTC, NOT/USDT, NOT/BNB, NOT/FDUSD, and NOT/TRY. The Seed Tag will be applied to $NOT, indicating its potential for significant growth.
The Broader Ecosystem and Future Prospects
Explore, Play, Contribute, and Offer
Notcoin’s ecosystem revolves around four key pillars:

Explore: Users earn rewards by discovering new web3 products.
Play: Participation in games yields additional rewards.
Contribute: Adding value to the ecosystem through various means also earns rewards.
Offer: Web3 builders can promote their products through Notcoin campaigns.

Integration with Other Projects
Notcoin plans to integrate with other web3 projects, allowing users to earn rewards by engaging with different content. These projects will need to purchase NOT tokens on the open market and deposit them into a smart contract to activate these features.
Pre-Market Vouchers
Before the $NOT token launch, Notcoin introduced NFT vouchers. Players with over 10 million Notcoin could convert their coins into vouchers, which can be traded before the token launch. This system allows high-level players to speculate on the future value of $NOT.
Future Developments
Post-launch, Notcoin’s gameplay will resume with some changes. While no new tokens will be minted, companies can sponsor in-game rewards to gain exposure to Notcoin’s vast audience. Additionally, Open Builders plans to introduce trading bot functionality, enabling users to buy and sell crypto tokens directly within Telegram.
Personal Opinions and Price Predictions
Given Notcoin’s massive user base and the fair distribution model, the $NOT token has significant growth potential. The token’s price could initially range between $0.002 to $0.003, with an all-time high (ATH) around $0.004. With a market cap potentially between $400 million to $500 million, $NOT presents an exciting investment opportunity.
Conclusion
Notcoin’s journey from a viral Telegram game to a community-driven token on Binance Launchpool exemplifies the innovative potential of web3 projects. By staking BNB and FDUSD, users can farm $NOT tokens and participate in a dynamic ecosystem that rewards exploration, play, and contribution. With its upcoming listing on Binance and plans for future integrations, Notcoin is poised to become a significant player in the crypto space.

Consensys Innovation Adds Smart Transactions Feature to MetaMask


							

Smart Transactions on MetaMask ensure 99.5% transaction success, combating MEV attacks and reducing gas costs for users globally.



MetaMask’s Smart Transactions revolutionized Ethereum transactions, offering security and efficiency.



Through Smart Transactions, Consensys continues driving blockchain evolution, prioritizing user experience and security.




As reported by Wu Blockchain, a crypto news reporter, the blockchain firm Consensys has introduced Smart Transactions. This innovative technology, set to roll out globally as an optional feature on MetaMask, aims to address pressing issues such as transaction success rates, gas costs, and protection against MEV attacks.







Smart Transactions leverage advanced technology to ensure users’ transactions remain private until confirmed on the chain, effectively thwarting preemptive actions by bots. According to EigenPhi estimates, MEV attacks cost Ethereum users a sum of up to 124,000 ETH in 2023 alone, highlighting the urgency for solutions like Smart Transactions.



One of Smart Transactions’ standout features is its ability to significantly enhance transaction success rates. During beta testing, it boasted an impressive 99.5% success rate, surpassing industry benchmarks and promising a smoother transaction experience for MetaMask users worldwide.



Moreover, Smart Transactions offer tangible benefits in terms of reduced gas costs and protection against MEV attacks such as frontrunning and sandwiching. By pre-simulating transactions using MetaMask’s just-in-time simulation service, users can enjoy lower gas fees and avoid costly surprises associated with failed transactions.









Gal Eldar, Executive Director of Product at MetaMask, emphasized the importance of addressing the complexities and challenges inherent in submitting transactions to a distributed network. The introduction of Smart Transactions represents a proactive step towards mitigating issues like frontrunning attacks and overpayments for block space, ultimately enhancing user experience and financial security.



Moving ahead, MetaMask plans to introduce further enhancements to the transaction lifecycle. These ongoing optimizations aim to increase transaction rates, lower gas costs, and ensure the value of trades for Smart Transactions users.



Consensys, renowned for its contributions to the blockchain and web3 ecosystem since 2014, continues to drive innovation through its product suite, which includes MetaMask, Infura, Linea, Diligence, and Phosphor.

Busted! North Korea Caught Laundering Millions Via Shady Crypto Mixer


								Once more, North Korea has demonstrated its cyber prowess, possibly undermining international sanctions by using cryptocurrencies. According to a recent assessment by UN sanctions monitors, North Korea is suspected of using the Tornado Cash platform to launder a whopping $148 million that was taken from a cryptocurrency exchange in March.
This event highlights how difficult it is becoming to enforce sanctions in the digital era, when illegal actors can hide their identities behind cryptocurrencies.

Mixing Up The Rules: How Tornado Cash Facilitated Money Laundering
According to the UN report, the stolen funds, believed to be from the HTX exchange hacked in late 2023, were funneled through Tornado Cash, a crypto mixer.
These platforms obfuscate the origin of transactions by essentially pooling funds together and then distributing them to new addresses. This makes it extremely difficult, if not impossible, to track the original source of the money.


North Korea Making Big Bucks On Cyberattacks
The UN monitors, citing data from blockchain research firms, further revealed that North Korea has likely conducted a total of 97 cyberattacks on cryptocurrency companies since 2017, netting an estimated $4 billion.
This year alone, North Korean hackers are suspected to be behind a dozen crypto thefts worth around $55 million. Experts believe these attacks are often carried out by skilled DPRK (Democratic People’s Republic of Korea) IT workers employed by unsuspecting small crypto firms, granting them insider access to exploit vulnerabilities.
Total crypto market cap currently at $2.2 trillion. Chart: TradingView
Global Crackdown On Tornado Cash: A Step In The Right Direction?
The international community has not turned a blind eye to these illicit activities. The US government sanctioned Tornado Cash in 2022, labeling it a money-laundering tool frequently used by North Korean cybercriminals. This action complemented broader efforts to regulate digital platforms susceptible to financial fraud.

The recent sentencing of Tornado Cash developer Alexey Pertsev to 64 months in prison by a Dutch court further highlights the tightening grip on such platforms. However, the case also exposes the complexities of regulating cryptocurrencies, a decentralized technology that transcends national borders. International cooperation and coordinated efforts are crucial to tackle this challenge effectively.
Looking Ahead: Securing The Future Of Crypto
The North Korean cryptocurrency laundering case serves as a wake-up call. It underscores the urgent need for a multi-pronged approach to tackle the issue. Governments, regulatory bodies, and the cryptocurrency industry itself must collaborate to address vulnerabilities, enhance transaction transparency, and establish robust anti-money laundering (AML) frameworks.

Round Two of Crypto Bull Market Coming Up, With One Memecoin Ready To Lead the Pack: Analyst - The Daily Hodl


								A widely followed crypto analyst is predicting that Bitcoin (BTC) is about to take off on another bull run after chopping around for weeks.
Pseudonymous crypto trader Inmortal tells his 213,800 followers on the social media platform X that Bitcoin appears to be mirroring a 2020 pattern of trading around the prior cycle’s all-time high (ATH) before a massive bull run.










“It is not hope. It is not a dream. Round two of the bull market is almost here. Grab your balls and ride the trend.”
Source: Inmortal/X
The trader says that the current market structure may appear bearish, but Bitcoin remains within a trading range and predicts it is only a matter of time before a breakout.
“The bad news? Not a single higher high since all-time high. The good news? We are still in the range and above market order. What to do? In my opinion, doing nothing is the best thing you can do now.”
Source: Inmortal/X
Bitcoin is trading for $61,765 at time of writing, down 1.5% in the last 24 hours.
He also re-confirms his prediction that memecoin dog-themed crypto asset Floki (FLOKI) will outperform the broader crypto market after financial giant VanEck’s MarketVector’s Meme Coin Index, which trades under the symbol MEMECOIN, just added Floki to its portfolio.
“VanEck added FLOKI to its Memecoin Index. The suits are gearing up for round two of the bull market and it shows. I’ve been saying it for quite some time, but I think FLOKI will lead this cycle.”
FLOKI is trading for $0.0001965 at time of writing, up more than 6% in the last 24 hours.

Lens Lab, Developer of Web3 Project Lens Protocol, Announced an Important Update! - Bitcoin Sistemi

Lens Lab, a key component of the Web3 project Avara and a key developer of the social graph Lens Protocol, has announced plans to develop its own EVM-compatible Layer 2 network known as Lens Network.
Lens Protocol Announces ZK Stack-Powered Validium Chain Plan
Lens Network will be an EVM-compatible Validium chain developed using zkSync's Layer 2 development stack, ZK Stack.


The transition to Lens Network will be carried out in three stages:
Starting with a Validium chain on Ethereum, then introducing a data availability provider and finally integrating Volition to increase security and user control over transactions.





Validium and Volition are blockchain scaling solutions that use zero-knowledge (ZK) proofs, but they operate under different security assumptions.
“Lens Network is creating a hybrid architecture that combines Validium and Volition with the ZK Stack on Ethereum. This will not only scale, but also make the internet more open and fair.” said Stani Kulechov, founder of Avara.


The project has so far used the Polygon POS chain to process transactions and has previously developed its own scaling solution called Momoka.

The lens is defined as a social graph that refers to a decentralized and user-owned map of the connections and relationships between individuals and entities.





Serving as user profiles, NFTs allow users to interact with decentralized applications within its ecosystem. The design of Lens-based dapps prevents any single entity from gaining control over the content.
The Lens Network will support a new version of the Lens Protocol, which will act as a central hub for Lens users.
This hub will seamlessly integrate with other EVM and non-EVM blockchains, further increasing the versatility and utility of the Lens ecosystem.

Gemini: the artificial intelligence that transforms Google

Sundar Pichai, CEO of Google, announced the integration of its advanced artificial intelligence model Gemini into various products and services of the company, including the famous search engine. 
So, soon, Google Gemini users will have access to new features. Let’s see all the details below. 

Innovative perspectives for Google Gemini users with artificial intelligence
As anticipated, Google’s artificial intelligence (AI) model Gemini has been integrated into various areas of the tech giant’s technology. Soon, artificial intelligence will make its appearance in Gmail, YouTube, and the company’s smartphones.
During the opening speech at the company’s I/O 2024 developer conference, held on May 14, Google CEO Sundar Pichai unveiled some of the upcoming contexts in which his artificial intelligence model will be used.
Pichai referred to AI a total of 121 times in his 110-minute keynote, highlighting the importance of the topic while Gemini, launched in December 2023, was under the spotlight.
Google is integrating the Large Language Model (LLM) into its offerings, including Android, Search, and Gmail. Gemini will gain more contextualization, allowing users to interact with applications. 
With the next update, users will be able to summon Gemini to interact with apps, such as dragging and dropping an image generated by artificial intelligence into a message.
YouTube users will be able to tap “Ask this video” to get specific information from the AI directly within the video.
Even Gmail, Google’s email platform, is seeing the integration of artificial intelligence. Users will be able to search, summarize, and compose their emails using Gemini.
The AI assistant will be able to intervene in emails for more complex tasks, such as assisting in processing returns of online purchases, searching in the mailbox, identifying the receipt, and filling out online forms.
The new frontiers of Google’s artificial intelligence
Furthermore, Google has recently introduced an innovative experience called Gemini Live, which allows users to engage in “deep” voice chats with AI directly on their smartphones.
This chatbot allows users to interrupt it during a response for clarifications and adapts to users’ speech patterns in real time. Additionally, Gemini is able to perceive and respond to the surrounding physical environment through photos or videos captured on the device.
Google is actively developing artificial intelligence agents capable of reasoning, planning, and completing complex tasks in multiple stages, under the supervision of the user. 
The multimodal approach allows AI to handle inputs not only of text, but also of images, audio, and video.
Among the examples of use, there are the automation of purchase returns and the exploration of new cities. In addition, Google plans to fully integrate Gemini into its mobile operating system, replacing Google Assistant on Android. 
A new feature called “Ask for photos” will allow you to search the photo library using natural language queries based on Gemini, which includes context, recognizes objects and people, and summarizes photographic memories in response to questions.
Finally, Google Maps will show summaries of places and areas generated by artificial intelligence, using information from the platform’s map data.
OpenAI challenges Google’s dominance
OpenAI has announced the launch of its long-awaited artificial intelligence-based research product, thus putting Google’s research giant supremacy to the test. 
The entrance of OpenAI into the research field means a significant increase in competition among technology giants. 
Bloomberg and other sources have revealed that the collaboration between OpenAI and Microsoft involves the development of a direct search tool to compete with Google. 
Furthermore, the startup Perplexity, which uses artificial intelligence, has made significant progress in this sector.
The next research service from OpenAI is based on its renowned product ChatGPT, with the goal of revolutionizing the way users interact with information online. 
Thanks to the use of advanced artificial intelligence, ChatGPT will be able to retrieve and present web data with appropriate citations, thus distinguishing itself from conventional search engines.
This innovative approach aims to improve the user experience, while addressing persistent challenges related to accuracy and timeliness in retrieving information online. 
Even though ChatGPT has proven to be a valid alternative for gathering information, concerns arise about its ability to provide real-time data.
The integration with Microsoft’s Bing for premium subscribers was a first step towards enhancing its features, but the next search product aims to take it to a new level. 
Previously, Microsoft had only captured 1% of the market share thanks to the collaboration with GPT.

Crypto in peril as court ruling sets a dangerous precedent


On May 14, a Dutch court sentenced Alexey Pertsev, developer of Tornado Cash, to five years in prison. This unprecedented ruling can create a dangerous precedent for cryptocurrency and privacy development, challenging previous worldwide regulatory knowledge.
In a surprising development, Alexey Pertsev was convicted of money laundering—not because he directly laundered money, but because he developed and maintained an open-source and permissionless privacy tool on Ethereum (ETH) that a minority of users allegedly used for criminal activities.
Notably, the Dutch court estimates that 84% of all transactions in Tornado Cash were non-criminal, according to a report by FreedomTech. This has outraged the crypto and privacy communities, as experts warn of a dangerous precedent that could harm the industry.


According to multiple sources, most open-source protocols and applications could become a target following this ruling’s logic. 
Experts warn of dangerous precedent from Tornado Cash’s Dutch ruling
In this context, independent journalist and privacy advocate Lola Leetz deemed the Tornado Cash verdict “completely insane.” In a thread posted on X, Leetz explained the consequences of the Dutch ruling and how it changes developers’ accountability.
As described, “open-source developers building non-custodial tools can be held responsible for criminal activity when criminal actors cannot be stopped or deanonymized.” Leetz also explained that this laid out software development as criminal intent. Moreover, the journalist classifies Tornado Cash as a communications service despite the court ruling otherwise.

The open-source development and privacy hub FreedomTech made a similar thread that delves into more details of the Tornado Cash ruling on the Netherlands.
Essentially, the thread argues that Pertsev could not stop the illicit use of his tool and highlights that it even implemented compliance features according to the known regulations at that time.

What is next for crypto and privacy developers?
Interestingly, Joel Valenzuela – responsible for business development and marketing for Dashpay – warned of privacy being “under attack.” Valenzuela mentioned other regulation and enforcement events that fall in a similar category to Alexey Pertsev’s sentencing.
In particular, the arrest of Samourai Wallet developers, Wasabi Wallet’s leaving the United States and then shutting down, privacy coins’ delistings, and peer-to-peer crypto exchange platforms’ shutting down.
Nevertheless, the content creator highlighted privacy as a human right and a normal attribute to seek. According to him, cryptocurrency users should focus on using privacy by default for everyday transactions, like “buying a coffee.”
Joel also said developers should avoid being in the U.S. and Europe while remaining anonymous for safety concerns. 

In conclusion, the Dutch court’s ruling against Alexey Pertsev sets a troubling precedent for cryptocurrencies and privacy. This decision undermines the role of developers in creating open-source, non-custodial tools.
Experts warn that targeting developers in this way threatens innovation and privacy rights. The case has agitated the crypto community, emphasizing potential widespread implications for similar technologies.
Developers and privacy advocates continue to voice their concerns, pointing out the ruling’s broader impact on privacy and online freedom. Moving forward, the industry must navigate these new legal challenges carefully to protect privacy and foster innovation in the digital space.

AI Firm Dynatrace Reports EPS and Revenue Beat in Fiscal Q4 - Tokenist


					
Neither the author, Tim Fries, nor this website, The Tokenist, provide financial advice. Please consult our website policy prior to making financial decisions.



In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2024, Dynatrace (NYSE: DT) delivered remarkable financial performance, exceeding its own guidance across all key metrics. The company reported total revenue of $381 million, marking a 21% year-over-year increase, and subscription revenue of $360 million, up 23%. The annual recurring revenue (ARR) reached $1.504 billion, reflecting a 21% growth. The GAAP income from operations stood at $23 million, with a non-GAAP income from operations at $95 million. The GAAP earnings per share (EPS) were $0.13, while the non-GAAP EPS came in at $0.30, indicating a robust financial health.



Dynatrace’s CEO, Rick McConnell, attributed the strong quarterly results to a record number of seven-figure deals closed during the period. The company’s focus on consolidating disparate monitoring tools into a unified observability platform has resonated well with customers, driving substantial growth. The company also announced a $500 million share repurchase program, underscoring its confidence in future growth prospects and commitment to enhancing shareholder value.



Dynatrace Beats EPS and Revenue Expectations in Fiscal Q4



Comparing Dynatrace’s actual performance against market expectations, the company outperformed both EPS and revenue projections. Analysts had anticipated an EPS of $0.27 and revenue of $375.27 million for the quarter. However, Dynatrace exceeded these expectations with an EPS of $0.30 and revenue of $381 million. This overachievement highlights the company’s effective execution of its strategic initiatives and ability to capitalize on market opportunities.



The company’s 21% year-over-year ARR growth, reaching $1.504 billion, further surpassed expectations. This metric is crucial as it reflects the recurring nature of Dynatrace’s revenue, providing a stable and predictable income stream. The strong performance in subscription revenue, which grew by 23%, also indicates a healthy demand for Dynatrace’s services and a successful customer retention strategy.





Dynatrace Forecasts Total Revenue for Full Year 2025 to Be Between $1.644 Billion and $1.658 Billion



Looking ahead, Dynatrace has issued optimistic guidance for the first quarter and full fiscal year 2025. The company expects ARR to be in the range of $1.720 billion to $1.735 billion, representing a 14% to 15% growth as reported, and 15% to 16% on a constant currency basis. For the first quarter, total revenue is anticipated to be between $391 million and $393 million, with subscription revenue projected at $374 million to $376 million.



For the full fiscal year 2025, Dynatrace forecasts total revenue between $1.644 billion and $1.658 billion, with subscription revenue expected to range from $1.571 billion to $1.585 billion. The non-GAAP income from operations is projected to be between $459 million and $467 million, with a non-GAAP operating margin of 28%. The company also anticipates a non-GAAP net income per diluted share of $1.26 to $1.29.

HTX Hong Kong Affiliate Set to Close in August Following Second Crypto License Withdrawal | Coinspeaker



The SFC removed HBGL from the list of license applicants on its official website on May 14, following the withdrawal of the application.

The Hong Kong unit of the crypto exchange HTX, formerly known as Huobi Global, is preparing to cease operations in the region. This decision follows the withdrawal of its license application for the second time. Initially, the company, operating under the name HBGL or Huobi HK, withdrew its license application to the Hong Kong Securities and Exchange Commission (SFC) in February 2024, just three days after its submission on February 20.
However, HBGL decided to resubmit the application after making adjustments to comply with local regulations as a virtual asset trading platform. According to a report by the South China Morning  Post, citing the SFC list of license applicants, the company has once again retracted the updated application from the authorities.




HBGL to Exit the Hong Kong Market in August
The SFC removed HBGL from the list of license applicants on its official website on May 14, following the withdrawal of the application. Consequently, the exchange has been instructed to halt all its operations in Hong Kong in accordance with the law.
While HBGL has not disclosed the reasons behind its decision to withdraw the application, as an unregulated exchange, the company is required to leave Hong Kong within three months, as mandated by SFC regulations. This means its departure will take place by August.
Hong Kong began requiring crypto exchanges seeking to operate in the country to obtain licenses from the SFC following the introduction of its new crypto regime. The law allows the exchanges to service retail customers in the region.
Digital assets trading platforms that qualify for the license will be able to operate in Hong Kong under a special arrangement while awaiting full licensing from the SFC in June, according to the new law.
For unqualified firms, the market watchdog may decide to send a notice informing them of the situation. These companies are required by law to leave the country at the end of May 2024, or three months from the time of the notice from the SFC.
Hong Kong Crypto License Applicants and Approvals
Since the introduction of the new digital assets regime in 2023, the SFC has approved a number of applications, starting with HashKey Exchange. The company made history in August 2023 as the first to receive approval from the financial regulator to offer crypto services to retail customers in the region.
Other companies, such as OSL Digital Securities and Hash Blockchain Limited, have been awarded coveted crypto licenses to support their operations in the country.
As indicated on the SFC website, companies like BGE Limited, the Hong Kong division of HKE Holdings, OKX Hong Kong,  and  DFX Labs are among the list of applicants awaiting decisions from the financial watchdog.
The SFC ceased accepting applications from digital assets trading platforms on February 29, 2024.

Shiba Inu is approaching key resistance levels that could determine its next price movement. The 26-day EMA, followed by the 50-day EMA, are the main targets for SHIB's price in the foreseeable future.SHIB is currently trading around $0.00002379. The price has been consolidating within a descending triangle. However, recent price action suggests a breakout. The 26-day EMA, around $0.00002385, is the first resistance level for SHIB. If it manages to break this level, the next target would be the 50-day EMA, currently at approximately $0.00002527.Volume analysis shows increased trading activity, with significant buying pressure observed during recent dips. This suggests that investors are accumulating SHIB at lower prices, which could support a potential breakout. The Relative Strength Index is around 45, indicating that SHIB is neither overbought nor oversold, showing room for upward movement.SHIB/USDT Chart by TradingViewExamining on-chain metrics, the number of large transactions and their volume offer additional insights. Over the past month, there has been a notable increase in large transactions, peaking at 280 transactions on May 13. The volume of these transactions reached a high of 9.6 trillion SHIB on the same day, highlighting substantial whale activity.The charts reveal that in the last 24 hours, 206 large transactions totaling 3.88 trillion SHIB were recorded. This high volume of transactions is a positive sign, indicating strong interest and engagement from large holders. If this trend continues, it could provide the necessary momentum for a breakthrough in SHIB’s price.Considering current market conditions and on-chain data, there is a strong possibility that SHIB could experience a breakout in the next 24 hours. The key levels to watch are the 26-day and 50-day EMAs.

Runes are Taking Off: Bitcoin-Based Tokens Get Performance Boost on Exchanges | Cryptopolitan

The market for Runes, the new generation of Bitcoin-based tokens, is taking off and showing both growing volumes and some clear winners. Runes are still in the discovery stage, but recent OKX statistics show mainstream trading may soon take off. OKX is also turning into an informal hub for early Runes trading. More than 50% of current volumes are concentrated on the exchange, where price discovery is happening. The appearance of runes followed a few months of testing out BRC-20 tokens as the main tool on the Bitcoin network. Runes are specific assets based on direct UTXO records, which first went live in April 2024. The early-stage asset may greatly impact the ecosystem, while avoiding blockchain bloat. Runes Aim for Efficient Bitcoin-Based TokenizationThe potential to create runes has existed since Bitcoin block 840,000, or for fewer than 4,000 blocks. Runes are the brainchild of Bitcoin developer Casey Rodarmore, to boost the creation of fungible tokens with a minimal effect on the blockchain. Overall, Runes are trying to offer a better tokenization standard, following previous attempts to generate Bitcoin-based tokens. Previously, Bitcoin offered technologies like colored coins. Later, Taproot assets, RGB tokens and BRC-20 assets went through their own hype cycle, but started causing network overload and high transaction fees.If Runes fulfills its promises, it may become the tool for the long-awaited “Bitcoin summer of DeFi”. The only drawback is that the expansion of Runes may take some time, and projects may already be dedicated to an older type of token. Runes Boost New Wave of Meme TokensIn the early days of Runes application, the chief driver for new projects is the creation or expansion of memes. The current leader of Rune technology tokens is Dog-Go-To-The-Moon (DOG), which is relatively obscure compared to other meme assets. DOG is ranked 268 based on market capitalization, with a supply of 100B tokens. The new meme token Rune launched on April 27, at $0.004, then slid by 50% to the current range of $0.002. Overall, Runes-based tokens have a market cap of just under $200M in total, but even at this early stage are showing competition and hype. Who Will Bring Liquidity to Runes?Runes offer some novelty, but token generation has become almost trivial in crypto space. In fact, more than 1 million tokens have been created, and very few make it into a liquid asset with meaningful trading. Finding the users, investors and markets for those tokens is a whole other issue. Just as soon as Runes launched on Bitcoin, there are projects that aim to bridge them with the Ethereum ecosystem, which still has the most liquid decentralized financial services. Currently, Runes projects are trying to build liquidity models, including Ordinals, NFT, and fungible tokens. Collections are dropping almost daily, competing for attention. Runes fungible tokens are still extremely volatile, even the earliest tokens with the most recognizable brands. At the current early stage, Runes are all about hype and seeing which memes and collections will rise. Early investors are trying to buy up as much Runes as possible. The Runes and NFT trading systems are still trying to smooth out order books to avoid volatility. Runes hopes to create an environment similar to Ethereum-based DeFi. But for now, the market is driven by factors like the recently renewed GameStop stock rally after the renewed messages from Roaring Kitty.The greatest appeal of Runes is that they are currently near rock-bottom valuations. The main hope is that the Bitcoin DeFi summer may build value similar to that locked on Solana and Ethereum. Runes may also be used for airdrops, or tied to Ordinals collections. Since anyone can “etch” a Rune and airdrop it, wallets are already receiving copycat tokens and new assets, with no known history or liquidity. Additionally, valid Runes in 2024 are those minted after block 840,000. Earlier projects also claimed to mint Runes, but some of the early assets may be destroyed or invalid.

XRP To Nearly $600? Analyst Makes Bold Claim


																A fresh prediction has ignited discussion in the XRP community. Analyst Cryptobilbuwoo is charting an ambitious course for the cryptocurrency, with a potential price target that has some investors excited and others skeptical.

	Related Reading



Echoes Of 2017: Fibonacci Paints A Bullish Picture
Cryptobilbuwoo’s forecast draws inspiration from historical patterns, particularly the XRP rally of 2017. By leveraging Fibonacci retracement levels, a common technical analysis tool, they see a potentially similar scenario unfolding for the altcoin.
Imagine a roadmap to the summit. Fibonacci levels act as checkpoints, highlighting potential resistance or support zones during a price rise. Cryptobilbuwoo suggests XRP could break through the $33 mark, aligning with the key Fib. 1.618 level.

This would be a significant step forward, but the real climb comes next – a projected ascent to $589, based on the Fib. 2.382 level.
A Lofty Target: Can XRP Reach The Top?
However, there’s a significant hurdle to overcome. To reach $589, the coin would require a staggering price increase of over 100,000%. This ambitious target has many market analysts raising eyebrows. It’s a leap that some consider more akin to wishful thinking than a realistic market prediction.
XRPUSD is currently trading at $0.49. Chart: TradingView
Other crypto market analysts present a contrasting view, suggesting XRP could even fall to zero. While this scenario seems extreme, it underscores the inherent volatility of the cryptocurrency market.
At the time of writing, XRP was trading at $0.5004, down 1.4% and 4.2% in the daily and weekly timeframes, data from Coingecko shows.
Meanwhile, in the XRP community, the $589 narrative used to be the main focus. The community’s excitement to see XRP at $589 is evident in the tweet below:

Signs Of Optimism: Fueling The Ascent?
Despite the skepticism surrounding the $589 target, there are positive signs for XRP. The coin has displayed resilience, consistently hovering above the psychologically important $0.50 level.
Additionally, a trend of investors moving XRP off exchanges has emerged. This could indicate a more long-term bullish outlook and potentially reduce selling pressure.

Technically, Cryptobilbuwoo finds support for their prediction in XRP’s historical price charts. They point to a descending triangle pattern on the XRP/BTC chart, a formation that preceded XRP’s breakout in 2017. Could this be a sign of history repeating itself?
The Verdict: A Measured Climb Or A Fall From Grace?
The future for XRP likely lies somewhere between the extremes. The $589 target might be overly optimistic, but a measured upswing based on technical indicators and reduced selling pressure remains a possibility.

El Salvador's Eco-Friendly Bitcoin Mining Yields 474 Coins


							

El Salvador mines nearly 474 bitcoins in 3 years using geothermal power.



Government’s Bitcoin Holdings reach $354 million, aiming for eco-friendly mining.



Collaboration with major miners verifies past Bitcoin transactions.




El Salvador has substantially increased its Bitcoin holdings by mining nearly 474 bitcoins in the last three years. This achievement, powered by the country’s geothermal energy plants, elevates the government’s total bitcoin portfolio to approximately $354 million. El Salvador seeks to leverage its volcanic activity for a more sustainable way to mine the cryptocurrency, setting itself apart from the conventional methods that have drawn environmental criticism.



President Nayib Bukele, a vocal Bitcoin advocate, re-elected in 2024, authorised the installation of 300 processors specifically designed for mining bitcoins. These processors utilise 1.5 MW of power from a 102 MW geothermal plant.



Cryptocurrency mining typically requires vast amounts of energy for complex computations and cooling facilities. The high energy demand has raised concerns about the environmental impact of cryptocurrency mining, particularly its strain on power grids and contribution to carbon emissions.









Reports indicate El Salvador’s foray into geothermal Bitcoin mining is not without its challenges. While the 1.5 MW dedicated to mining represents a small portion of the plant’s overall capacity, the long-term success of this strategy hinges on two key factors; the price of Bitcoin and the efficiency of mining operations. 



Furthermore, El Salvador’s 2021 decision to adopt Bitcoin as a legal tender alongside the US dollar remains a point of contention. The International Monetary Fund (IMF) and other financial institutions have expressed concerns about the volatility of Bitcoin and its potential impact on the country’s financial stability.



Despite these hurdles, El Salvador’s experiment with geothermal Bitcoin mining is a significant development in the cryptocurrency world. It remains to be seen if this approach can offer a sustainable and environmentally friendly model for the future of cryptocurrency mining.

BlockTower Capital’s Primary Hedge Fund Falls Victim to Fraud


																BlockTower Capital’s primary hedge fund has fallen victim to fraudsters, who have managed to drain its assets partially.
According to the Bloomberg report, the stolen funds have not yet been recovered, and the perpetrator remains at large. However, one source revealed that the firm roped in blockchain forensics experts to investigate the theft and recently informed its partners about the incident.

The latest development suggests that even a major investment firm is not immune to threats that mostly prey on retail investors.
Interestingly, BlockTower Capital lost nearly $1.5 million after the exploit of decentralized exchange aggregator Dexible last February.
The wallet address in question linked to the Dexible exploiter drained approximately $1.5 million in TRU tokens from a wallet identified as BlockTower’s by Arkham Intelligence. Nansen also confirmed the wallet was labeled as BlockTower Capital.
The company shut down its “market-neutral” crypto fund last year due to a shortage of viable investment opportunities.
In addition to BlockTower’s exploit, a lesser-known decentralized lending protocol called Sonne Finance was also exploited that resulted $20 million in losses.
In its post-mortem report, Sonne stated that its team discovered the issue 25 minutes after the exploit occurred. Although they couldn’t recover the funds, the investigation into the exploiter’s identity is currently underway.
The protocol also mentioned they are willing to offer a bounty to the exploiter and commit to not pursuing the matter further if the funds are returned.

Cryptocurrency Investment Firm Became the Victim of a Hacker Attack! A Significant Part of the Hedge Fund Was Stolen! - Bitcoin Sistemi


BlockTower Capital, a leading cryptocurrency investment firm, has reportedly fallen victim to a hacker attack and its main hedge fund has been partially drained, according to sources cited in Bloomberg's report.
BlockTower Capital's Main Hedge Fund Reportedly Targeted in Hacker Attack
The report published today revealed that hackers compromised BlockTower's main hedge fund, leading to the disappearance of a significant portion of the fund's assets.


The exact amount of stolen funds was not disclosed by the company, and the hackers responsible for the breach have still not been caught.
BlockTower took swift action regarding the incident and enlisted the help of blockchain experts to conduct a thorough investigation into the matter. However, the firm did not offer any further details or comments regarding the ongoing investigation.






This isn't the first time BlockTower has faced difficulties in protecting its assets. In February 2023, it was reported that the firm lost $1.55 million worth of TrueFi tokens in a separate fraud incident.
Also last year, BlockTower liquidated a crypto fund that once managed over $100 million in total assets, according to Bloomberg.


Despite these setbacks, BlockTower has continued to have a significant presence in the cryptocurrency investment landscape since its founding in 2017.
According to Dealroom's data, the company has been involved in supporting important projects in the crypto and Web3 space, such as Dapper Labs, Sky Mavis and Aptos Labs.

Optimism-based DeFi Protocol Loses $20 Million in Major Attack


Sonne Finance, a pioneering decentralized finance (DeFi) protocol operating on the Optimism Mainnet, has fallen victim to a devastating exploit, resulting in a loss exceeding $20 million. The attack, suspected to have been orchestrated through a time-locked contract loophole, has sent shockwaves through the burgeoning DeFi landscape.According to insights from PeckShield, a blockchain security firm, Sonne Finance was targeted in what appears to be a carefully orchestrated attack, leveraging vulnerabilities in the protocol's smart contract infrastructure. The exploit, which involved a known donation attack technique commonly associated with Compound v2 forks, unfolded despite the platform's proactive measures to bolster security.Optimism markets suspendedSonne Finance, notable as the first platform to launch a lending protocol on Optimism, promptly responded to the breach with an official blog post. In the statement, the team expressed deep regret over the incident and detailed the sequence of events leading to the exploit. The attackers capitalized on a two-day timelock feature, strategically executing transactions to manipulate market creation and collateral factors within the protocol.Despite efforts to detect and mitigate the hack swiftly, the Sonne Finance team acknowledged the loss of funds and initiated an urgent investigation into the perpetrators' identities. Notably, the team highlighted the vigilant efforts of Seal contributors, whose prompt action helped salvage approximately $6.5 million by injecting VELO tokens into affected markets.The exploit, detected by the Sonne Finance team approximately 25 minutes after it occurred, triggered the immediate suspension of all Optimism markets operated by the protocol. Moreover, the team pledged to offer a bounty to the exploiters and refrain from pursuing legal action if the misappropriated funds were returned.In a bid to contain further damage and safeguard user assets, Sonne Finance promptly paused all market activities and engaged in dialogue with relevant stakeholders to explore avenues for fund recovery. The team reiterated its commitment to transparency and accountability, vowing to collaborate with external parties to address the aftermath of the attack comprehensively.

Circle shifts legal home to US ahead of IPO

Circle Internet Financial — the company behind the world’s second-largest stablecoin, USD Coin — announced its plans to move its legal base from the Republic of Ireland to the United States. The shift comes amid tightening cryptocurrency regulations in the United States.According to Bloomberg, a spokesperson for Circle confirmed on May 14 that the company had filed court paperwork for the move, but the specific reasons were not disclosed. The decision aligns with Circle’s recent step toward going public — it submitted plans for an initial public offering (IPO) confidentially through a brief press release in January.Legal implications In contrast to Ireland’s reduced levels of corporate taxation, the relocation of Circle’s legal base to the U.S. would incur higher tax rates. However, these benefits are being cut due to global tax reforms led by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD). After approval in October 2021, the OECD Global Anti-Base Erosion Rules came into force, clamping down on multinational enterprises (MNE) and issuing a minimum of 15% tax on MNE profits globally.Furthermore, moving back to the U.S. could subject Circle to a new U.S. regulatory framework and scrutiny from the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). On the heels of its plans for an IPO, Circle would need to strictly adhere to securities laws as it traverses the muddy waters of SEC regulations. Despite the successful launch of Coinbase’s IPO in April 2021, the regulatory combat continues, as demonstrated by the ongoing Coinbase-SEC lawsuit.Circle’s core business ventures revolve around its stablecoin, USD Coin (USDC), which has a market cap of almost $33 billion. The decision to relocate is grounded in a logical rationale, as the necessity for U.S. regulatory compliance aligns closely with maintaining investor confidence. Though compliance-related costs may be higher in the U.S., the pay-off is increased transparency and improved likelihood of adoption. The Internet Financial SystemFollowing in the footsteps of Coinbase, Circle’s own IPO could grant USDC a competitive edge over its number-one spot competitor, Tether (USDT). After flipping USDT monthly transactions in December 2023, an increase in regulatory compliance could solidify USDC’s position in the stablecoin market. Jeremy Allaire, the CEO and Co-founder at Circle, has already made his stance clear that the future of the “Internet Financial System” will not be a “bunch of closed government networks.” Source: Jeremy AllaireBetween relocating Circle’s legal base to the U.S., deciding to launch an IPO, and Allaire’s tweet articulating his perspective of a decentralized financial system, the strategic angle remains the same. Circle appears to be aligning with Allaire’s vision through a series of strategic realignments, including achieving regulatory compliance, securing capital via going public and enhancing operational capacities, despite these efforts seeming disconnected.

How Will Bitcoin Cash (BCH) Price React as Selling Declines?


Bitcoin Cash’s (BCH) price shows signs of recovery, which is important if the altcoin intends to reach $450 again.
Supporting this potential bullish outcome are the investors who have moved away from selling for now.
Bitcoin Cash Investors See Growth
Bitcoin Cash’s price is currently trading at $430, above key support. This support level has signaled recoveries in the past, and the same is anticipated in the coming days. Backing this potential are the BCH holders, who have been acting bullishly over the past couple of days.
The Market Value to Realized Value (MVRV) ratio is still under the zero line. The MVRV ratio tracks investor gains/losses. Bitcoin Cash’s 30-day MVRV of -8.1% suggests losses, possibly prompting accumulation. Historically, BCH corrects at MVRV levels of -6% and -24%, labeling it an accumulation opportunity zone.

This signals that Bitcoin Cash’s price could see some increase.
Further substantiating this are the investors’ actions, which are looking positive right now. Upon distributing the active addresses by profitability, one can notice that most of the transactions conducted are by those looking for profits. 
BCH holders that are already in profit account for only 6% of all active addresses. This shows that participation is not dominated by investors looking to sell their assets to secure gains.

This is a signal that the investors are pining for a rise.
BCH Price Prediction: Key Level in Support
Bitcoin Cash’s price has surpassed the crucial 23.6% Fibonacci Retracement level set at $430. This level is pivotal as it serves as the bear market support floor, historically yielding recoveries when tested.

The same outcome is anticipated this time, given the altcoin is seeing support from its investors. The potential uptick could push BCH toward $450, right above the 38.2% Fibonacci Retracement.

This is an important psychological support level and could further the rise.
However, a breach has already failed once this month, and another failed breach could send Bitcoin Cash back to $430. If Bitcoin Cash’s price falls below this line, it is likely to experience a drawdown to $410 or $400, thereby invalidating the bullish thesis.

                        SHIB has risen by 2% today, with the Shiba Inu price touching $0.00002399 on a day when the crypto market gains by 0.5% in the past 24 hours.This price also means that SHIB has increased by 5.5% in the past week and by 15% in the past fortnight, with the meme coin also sitting on a 169% lift in a year.And its gain today comes as its price chart forms a bullish pennant pattern, meaning that its resistance and support levels are converging on each other.This could signal that the coin is very close to a big rally, something which the return of meme-stock trader Keith Gill has made likelier this week.Shiba Inu Price Prediction as Analysts Spot Bull Flag Formation – Is a Rally Imminent?
After rallying and dipping on each of the past two days, SHIB has rallied again in the past 24 hours, with its indicators looking very strong.Its relative strength index (purple) touched 70 earlier this morning, and despite a tiny dip, it has settled at around 65, indicating ongoing momentum and buying pressure.Source: TradingViewMore promisingly, SHIB’s 30-day average (orange) has begun rising again, after having recently overtaken the 200-day average (blue).The latter move is often a sign of a breakout and given that SHIB has risen strongly today, such a breakout appears to have recently begun.The coin’s resistance (red) and support (green) levels are point to such a possibility, with analysts recently taking to social media to suggest that SHIB is close to doing something special.SHIB’s promising movements also come as the meme token market hots up, with PEPE also being a big winner over the past couple of days.And the wider reason why the market has redoubled its interest in meme coins is that this week saw the return of GameStop instigator Keith Gill, better known as ‘Roaring Kitty.’Gill’s reappearance after a three-year absence has sparked expectations that we’ll see a meme token season in the coming weeks, with traders already wading into meme coins in anticipation.Yet more broadly, SHIB continues to be one of the strongest meme coins in the market, given its fundamentals.It recently unveiled its upcoming privacy-focused layer-three network, while its layer-two network Shibarium has now processed well over 400 million transactions.Based on its strength, the Shiba Inu price should reach $0.000030 in the next couple of months.New Meme Tokens with Solid Fundamentals
While SHIB may be one of the ‘safest’ bets within the meme token category, it certainly isn’t the only mew coin with the potential to witness big gains in the coming weeks.In fact, newer tokens may be in a better position to outperform the market, with several new meme coins holding very successful presales at the moment.One of the best is WienerAI (WAI), a new Ethereum-based cryptocurrency that has raised more than $1.8 million in its sale.WienerAI is the native token of an innovative AI-based trading bot that will help investors trade more profitably.As a chatbot, it answer trading queries and offer recommendations on potential winners, so that users can stay ahead of the market.Yet it will also offer an atomic swap function, so that users can directly buy (or sell) any recommended coins through its platform.On top of this, it provides protection against front-running bots and traders, enabling investors to make trades quickly and efficiently.This gives it plenty of utility as a platform, while its native token, WAI, will have a fixed max supply of 69 billion tokens.Also bullish is the fact that holders will be able to stake the coin for a passive income, something that will incentivize long-term holding.VIDEOGiven that so many meme tokens depend entirely on hype and FOMO, the fact that WienerAI has genuine fundamentals puts it in a great position.Investors can join its sale at the official WienerAI website, where 1 WAI is selling for $0.000707.The sale will end once it sells 30% of WAI’s overall supply, with the token set to list – and possibly rocket – soon afterwards.Buy WAI Today

                        In April 2024, Bitcoin faced its sharpest price drop since the FTX collapse, with halving charts in focus, but network activity soared to record highs, driven by new protocols and ETF developments. This report explores and analyzes Bitcoin’s ecosystem and the BTC price developments last month.
Key takeaways:


The Bitcoin price dropped following the fourth halving, reaching $57,000 before a quick rebound. This marks the sharpest decline since the FTX collapse.
Despite the price drop, the Bitcoin network saw a surge in activity in April, with daily transactions reaching a record high of 927k on April 23. However, this increase was short-lived, and it dropped again by the end of the month.
The surge in network activity led to record-high transaction fees in April, peaking at $25.8 million on April 24. This congestion might be linked to the Runes protocol launch.
Spot Bitcoin ETFs saw $343.5 million withdrawn from the funds in April – the first monthly net outflows since trading began in January.
While US ETFs faced outflows, Hong Kong launched its first three spot Bitcoin ETFs in April, potentially becoming a hub for Asian crypto investment.
Bitcoin Ordinals NFTs gained traction, reaching a $2.3 billion valuation, despite Binance ending support due to potential network strain.
Bitcoin remained the leader in NFT sales volume in April, generating over $594 million compared to other blockchains.

What is Bitcoin?
Bitcoin (BTC) is a decentralized cryptocurrency created to function as a digital currency and means of payment that operates independently of any single individual, organization, or authority, eliminating the need for third-party intermediaries in financial transactions.It is allocated to blockchain miners to validate transactions and can be purchased through various exchanges.Unveiled to the public in 2009 by an enigmatic developer or group known as Satoshi Nakamoto, Bitcoin has become the most widely recognized cryptocurrency in the world. Its success has spurred the creation of numerous other cryptocurrencies.BTC Price Performance And Halving Charts
While widely anticipated, Bitcoin’s fourth halving on April 20 followed the historical trend of short-term volatility. Bitcoin fell nearly 21% in April alone, dropping below $60,000 on April 19 as investors cashed out of a robust rally that had previously pushed prices above $72,500 (on April 8). Between April 30 and May 1, the Bitcoin price crashed below $57,000, its lowest level since late February.BTC/USD daily chart. Source: TradingViewInterestingly, past halving events also exhibited similar patterns. According to Glassnode data, while the first halving saw an immediate 11% gain, the subsequent two halving events saw price stagnation after two weeks. The 60-day period following halvings often shows choppy sideways movement, and price drops between -5% and -15%.BTC price performance after halvings. Source: GlassnodeAccording to 10x Research CEO and senior analyst Markus Thielen, Bitcoin could further fall to $52,000. The analyst predicts a drop to $52,000, citing a slowdown in the main driver of the rally – inflows into Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs), which dropped in April.Fidelity Digital Assets downgraded Bitcoin’s outlook to “neutral” after Q1. Its Q1 2024 Signals Report suggests that Bitcoin is no longer “cheap” and undervalued. The analysts also see potential selling pressure from long-term holders and high overall profitability. According to VanEck, 94% of Bitcoin addresses remain in profit despite a slight decline of 4% over the month.Analysts at Bitfinex, on the other hand, are more positive and predict Bitcoin will consolidate for 1-2 months after the halving. The experts expect Bitcoin to remain the market leader and believe the economic situation is more stable than in past halvings. This could lead to sideways trading with swings of $10,000, with any price increase from the halving happening later.

Bitcoin’s price dipped after the halving, but network activity boomed. Daily transactions increased by 135% after the halving, reaching 927k on April 23.

This frenzy was driven by the launch of Casey Rodarmor’s Runes protocol, which allows users to create tokens directly on the Bitcoin network, coinciding with the halving event.Runes offers an alternative to existing methods like the BRC-20 token standard – an Ordinals-based method for creating Bitcoin-based tokens. Both leverage Bitcoin’s network, but Runes utilizes a more efficient Unspent Transaction Output (UTXO) model, unlike the “inscription” method of BRC-20s.Amid increasing Bitcoin use for day-to-day purchases, the Bitcoin network recorded the highest number – 1.63 million – of confirmed payments on April 23.The total number of confirmed payments per day during April 2024. Source: Blockchain.comThis massive spike was also driven by the launch of the Runes protocol. According to Dune Analytics data, Runes accounted for a whopping 81.3% of all Bitcoin transactions that day. However, Bitcoin is making a comeback, reclaiming 82,6% of transactions by April 30. Other protocols like Ordinals (2,6%) and BRC-20 (0,7%) comprise a smaller portion of the network activity.Spot Bitcoin ETFs
April 2024 was a whirlwind for spot Bitcoin ETFs. After a period of immense enthusiasm and record inflows in Q1 2024—attracting $1.5 billion, $6 billion, and $4.6 billion in January, February, and March, respectively—April saw a significant shift in sentiment, with outflows surpassing inflows for the first time since the Bitcoin ETFs launched in January.In April, spot Bitcoin ETFs saw $343.5 million withdrawn from the funds, ending their three-month inflow streak. The initial inflows surge slowed significantly after peaking at $1.05 billion daily in mid-March. This coincided with a drop in Bitcoin’s price, which fell 18% from its all-time high by the end of April.Grayscale’s GBTC fund saw the most significant outflows at $2.5 billion. ARK Invest’s ARKB and Valkyrie’s BRRR also experienced minor outflows.BlackRock’s IBIT initially attracted the most inflows in April ($1.5 billion), followed by Fidelity’s FBTC and Bitwise’s BITB. However, IBIT’s impressive 71-day inflow streak ended on April 23 and has seen zero flows for five consecutive days since. The trend continued on April 30. ARKB was the only ETF with inflows ($3.6 million), while outflows from GBTC, FBTC and BITB resulted in a net outflow of $161.6 million for the day.Total spot Bitcoin ETF net inflow in USD. Source: CoinglassBitcoin ETFs’ trading activity also slowed significantly during the last month. After hitting a record daily volume of $9.9 billion on March 5 (coinciding with Bitcoin surpassing its previous cycle high), trading volume fell to $2.9 billion on April 30.BlackRock updated its Bitcoin ETFOn April 5, BlackRock, a leading asset manager, updated their Bitcoin ETF prospectus, adding five new authorized participants: ABN AMRO Clearing, Citadel Securities, Citigroup Global Markets, Goldman Sachs, and UBS Securities. This move adds to the existing roster of authorized participants, including JPMorgan, Jane Street Capital, Macquarie Capital, and Virtu Americas. By incorporating these big Wall Street players, BlackRock could increase liquidity and attract more institutional interest in their Bitcoin ETFs.Hong Kong launched Asia’s first Bitcoin ETFsWhile US spot Bitcoin ETFs have dominated headlines recently, April marked a significant shift. The Hong Kong Stock Exchange (HKEX) debuted three new spot Bitcoin ETFs on April 30, offering investors exposure to these leading cryptocurrency-based products. These include Bosera HashKey Bitcoin ETF (3008.HK), ChinaAMC Bitcoin ETF (3042.HK), and Harvest Bitcoin Spot ETF (3439.HK). This launch positions Hong Kong as a potential hub for Asian cryptocurrency investment.However, the inflows from the launched spot Bitcoin ETFs in Hong Kong were not enough to cover the outflows from the 11 US-based spot Bitcoin ETFs.DTCC rules out collateral for Bitcoin-linked ETFsOn April 26, the Depository Trust and Clearing Corporation (DTCC), a key player in financial settlements, dealt a blow to Bitcoin ETFs. DTCC announced it will not consider Bitcoin or other cryptocurrencies as collateral for loans or credit facilities. This change takes effect in late April, meaning these ETFs will have zero collateral value within the DTCC system.This decision could limit the attractiveness of Bitcoin ETFs for some institutional investors who rely on collateral for borrowing and managing risk. However, in an X post, cryptocurrency enthusiast K.O. Kryptowaluty clarified that this would only apply to inter-entity settlement within the line of credit system. The use of cryptocurrency ETFs for lending and as collateral in brokerage activities will continue unaffected, depending on the risk tolerance of individual brokers.Morgan Stanley and UBS want to offer Bitcoin ETFsFinancial giants Morgan Stanley and UBS, boasting a combined $2.36 trillion in assets under management, are reportedly gearing up to offer spot Bitcoin ETFs on their platforms. This move could be a major tipping point for institutional adoption of Bitcoin, bringing mainstream legitimacy and potentially driving broader investor interest.Australia’s top exchange expected to approve Bitcoin ETFs in 2024Australia’s leading stock exchange, the ASX, is expected to list its first spot Bitcoin ETFs by the end of 2024. Bloomberg quoted sources familiar with the matter saying several companies have already filed applications for these ETFs. These include established players like VanEck and local Australian firms BetaShares and DigitalX. With a domestic market capitalization of $2.7 trillion as of March 2024, the ASX is a major player in Australian finance, and the arrival of Bitcoin ETFs could further diversify investment options on the platform.Bitcoin Mining Updates 
Bitcoin miners feel the pinch after the halving cut their earnings (from 6.25 BTC to 3.125 BTC). According to data from Hashrate Index, the hash price fell below $45 per PH/s per day on May 2, despite a brief pop in revenue for miners post-halving amid the Runes frenzy transaction fee windfall (172 per PH/s on April 20).Bitcoin mining profitability (hash price) hits record lows after halving event. Source: Hashrate IndexAccording to crypto analytics firm CryptoQuant, the hash price for miners dropped from nearly $0.12 in early April to $0.07 post-halving, following a $0.19 peak on halving day.Despite the reduction in rewards, miners are still hashing, suggesting that BTC mining is still profitable at Bitcoin’s current prices. According to Ki Young Ju, CEO of CryptoQuant, there’s no sign of miners dumping their Bitcoin capitulation – for now. But, if Bitcoin prices keep dropping, large miners may be forced to sell some Bitcoin liquidate to stay afloat.While Bitcoin’s mining network appears stable in the short term, the long-term effects of halving the hash rate (processing power) and overall miner activity remain unclear. Historically, periods following halving events have witnessed some miners exiting the market due to increased operational costs. The future of Bitcoin mining will likely depend on factors like Bitcoin price fluctuations and changes in electricity costs.There are also some new April updates related to Bitcoin mining:Block develops its own Bitcoin mining systemPayments company Block, formerly known as Square, announced the development of a new Bitcoin mining system. This follows the completion of a 3-nanometer application-specific integrated circuit (ASIC) chip designed specifically for Bitcoin mining. Block plans to offer both standalone mining chips and complete mining systems.Waste heat from Bitcoin mining warms Finnish homesFinland is exploring utilizing waste heat from Bitcoin mining for residential heating. A new project by Hashlabs Mining integrates heat generation from specialized Bitcoin mining equipment (WhatsMiner M63S) with the existing district heating system. This system transfers heat from a central source (in this case, Bitcoin mining) through insulated pipes to multiple buildings. This initiative could provide a sustainable heating solution for Finnish households, particularly during cold winters.Norway tightens regulations for data centers, potentially impacting Bitcoin minersIn April, Norway enacted new legislation requiring all data centers to formally register with the government. This registration process will involve disclosing ownership, leadership, and the types of digital services offered. Terje Aasland, Norway’s Minister of Energy, stated that the government hopes this increased transparency will allow local authorities to make more informed decisions regarding data center operations, particularly their potential impact on Bitcoin mining activities.Bitcoin Ecosystem News 
April saw some important developments in the Bitcoin ecosystem, showing how companies innovate on multiple fronts.MicroStrategy unveils a decentralized identity solution on BitcoinMicroStrategy, known for its massive Bitcoin holdings, is venturing beyond simple investment. At their “Bitcoin For Corporations” conference on May 1, the company announced “MicroStrategy Orange,” a decentralized identity solution built on the Bitcoin network. This system will leverage Ordinal inscriptions to store data directly on the Bitcoin blockchain. This could revolutionize online identity management by offering a secure, tamper-proof and user-controlled alternative to traditional systems.Moreover, in April, MicroStrategy purchased $7.8 million worth of Bitcoin, bringing its total holdings to 214,400 BTC.Ankr brings Bitcoin liquidity to Talus’ AI-powered blockchainStarting May 1, Ankr, an infrastructure provider for decentralized blockchains, brought Bitcoin liquidity to Talus, a blockchain-focused on artificial intelligence (AI). This collaboration unlocks new possibilities for Talus’ smart agents and AI assistants, allowing Talus users to leverage the security and value of Bitcoin while participating in DeFi activities on the Talus network.Coinbase integrates Lightning Network for Bitcoin transactionsCoinbase is now offering users more flexibility when sending Bitcoin. The cryptocurrency exchange integrated the Lightning Network, a Layer 2 technology that enables quicker and cheaper transactions compared to the traditional Bitcoin blockchain. To use the Lightning Network, the intended recipient sends an invoice consisting of a lengthy string of characters that Coinbase recognizes as the transfer amount.For this integration, Coinbase chose Lightspark, a provider of Lightning payments solutions, as its partner.Animoca Brands enters Bitcoin with Opal FoundationHong Kong-based game software company Animoca Brands announced its foray into the Bitcoin industry on April 30. The firm aims to become the “largest Web3 ecosystem” for gaming, education and culture built on Bitcoin. This move involves backing the Opal Foundation, a new protocol within the Bitcoin ecosystem. The foundation will focus on the Opal Protocol and its associated token, BLIF (potentially referring to “Opal Protocol Runes”). BLIF is initiated by collaborating with Animoca Brands and the metaverse technology platform Darewise.Bitcoin DeFi Updates
The emergence of Ordinals has reinvigorated the Bitcoin decentralized application (DApp) ecosystem by demonstrating the potential for novel protocols on the network. One such protocol is the Runes protocol, launched on April 20.Runes is a new standard for creating tokens on the Bitcoin blockchain. It allows users to represent real-world assets such as real estate, stocks, commodities or even other cryptocurrencies (including stablecoins) using tokens on the Bitcoin network.Runes ecosystem overview. Source: @DoggFatherCrewThe growing interest in Runes could drive more activity to Layer 2 networks and increase the adoption of Bitcoin-native DApps, as we can see from recent developments.Stacks active accounts reach record-highData from Bitcoin data provider Signal 21 showed that Stacks, a Layer 2 network for Bitcoin, reached a new all-time high of 122,497 active accounts in April. Active accounts are defined as addresses with at least one transaction.Orders DEX unveils roadmapBitcoin decentralized exchange (DEX) Orders Exchange announced its 2024 roadmap on April 29. Plans include integrating with major Web3 wallets and building a Bitcoin nonfungible token (NFT) marketplace.Previously, Orders Exchange integrated with the Runes protocol to enable fungible token issuance and built a bridge with sidechain MicroVisionChain for BRC-20 token swaps.BEVM gains tractionLaunched in March 2024, BEVM, a Layer 2 scaling solution for Bitcoin, attracted over 700,000 user addresses and 30+ ecosystem projects during April 2024. Built on Taproot consensus, BEVM utilizes BTC for gas fees and boasts a current valuation of $200 million.BEVM also announced an investment from Bitmain, the world’s leading manufacturer of cryptocurrency mining servers. The exact amount of the investment was not disclosed.Bitcoin Ordinals NFTs
The Bitcoin Ordinals market has reached a valuation of $2.3 billion at publication, even amid a broader market downturn. Ordinals are the first iteration of NFTs on Bitcoin. Ordinals live solely on the Bitcoin blockchain, unlike most of today’s popular NFT collections that host their metadata on centralized servers, creating additional points of vulnerability.According to data from Dune Analytics, the network has over 66,3 million inscriptions to date and generated over $267 million in transaction fees.Bitcoin Ordinals boasted over 66 million inscriptions. Source: Dune AnalyticsIt’s no surprise that asset manager Franklin Templeton recognized Bitcoin Ordinals as a driving force behind the “renaissance” of activity on the Bitcoin network. Similarly, OKX Ventures, the investment arm of crypto exchange OKX, highlighted in its “2024 Bitcoin Outlook” report that Bitcoin Ordinals will play a “pivotal role” this year.However, the significant increase in NFT transactions has periodically congested the Bitcoin network since its inception, resulting in increased fees and slower processing times due to increased on-chain transaction validation. This circumstance may have influenced Binance’s decision on April 4 to discontinue support for Bitcoin Ordinals. As a result, users are no longer allowed to buy, sell or deposit Bitcoin Ordinals on the Binance NFT marketplace.Bitcoin NFTs lead the market
Among the 24 blockchain networks minting NFTs, Bitcoin emerged as the leader in April, with sales reaching $594 million.Bitcoin NFT sales reached $594 million in April, topping the charts.

NodeMonkes came in second in sales volume, reaching $32.7 million in April.Runestone ($RUNE) NFT collection gained significant popularity during the month, attracting $798.4k in April (10836% more than in March). $PUPs, another NFT collection on Bitcoin using BRC-20 protocol, reached a trading volume of $72.7 million (up 2087% from last month).Notable NFT launches in April:
Ordinal SigmaX (April 2 – April 9) is a digital collectibles project that features 5,555 unique, fully animated pixel-art profile pictures (PFPs).
The Rune Guardians (April 12 – April 19) is a collection of 10,000 PFP NFTs built on the Bitcoin blockchain. The project began with an airdrop of “Rune” NFTs to members of over 20 Ordinals communities (Ordinals are a type of NFT on Bitcoin).
Rune Mining Pups (April 20 – April 27) is a collection of 10,000 unique 2D pixel art NFTs on the Bitcoin blockchain. The project integrates functionalities associated with DAOs and offers potential benefits to holders. The collection’s theme revolves around characters who discover digital assets.
Looking ahead – Can the Bitcoin Halving Charts be Inversed?
The April 2024 halving triggered the expected short-term volatility in the Bitcoin market. Despite a price drop of nearly 21%, the network experienced a surge in activity, with record-breaking daily transactions and a significant rise in fees. This activity spike was partly fueled by the launch of the Runes protocol.Looking ahead, several factors will shape Bitcoin’s future trajectory:
Institutional investment: The entry of major financial institutions like Morgan Stanley and UBS into the spot Bitcoin ETF market signifies growing mainstream recognition and could drive broader investor interest. However, the DTCC’s decision not to consider Bitcoin as collateral for loan purposes might limit its appeal for some institutional investors.
Regulation: Regulatory developments like Norway’s data center registration requirement could impact Bitcoin mining operations. How other countries approach Bitcoin regulations will be crucial in shaping its future adoption.
Bitcoin DeFi: The emergence of the Runes protocol has revitalized the Bitcoin DApp ecosystem, showcasing the potential for novel use cases on the network. Continued innovation in this space could drive more activity to Layer 2 solutions.
While the post-halving period witnessed a price correction, the Bitcoin market continues to buzz with innovation. The influx of institutional interest, ongoing advancements in mining technology and the burgeoning DeFi space all point toward a dynamic future for Bitcoin. How these factors will interplay and ultimately shape Bitcoin’s trajectory remains to be seen.

Robinhood Crypto Rolls Out Solana Staking for European Users


On May 15, Robinhood, a multi-asset trading platform, announced a series of new features in its crypto services today. Robinhood Crypto has launched several new features aimed at its European customers.
Among the most notable updates are the introduction of a crypto-staking product and the rollout of localized app versions. These enhancements are designed to boost accessibility and improve user experience.
Robinhood Crypto Rolls Out Localized Apps for European Customers
Starting today, Robinhood Crypto will offer its first-ever crypto-staking product exclusively to European customers. The app allows users to stake their Solana (SOL) holdings.
They can also earn rewards with the flexibility to unstake at any time. Additionally, new customers can earn a 10% bonus on their net buys over their first 30 days on the platform, paid out in USDC.

Johann Kerbrat, VP and GM of Robinhood Crypto, noted that European customers had expressed a need for opportunities to earn passive income. He said that the new features mark a significant advancement. Furthermore, these features will offer a more tailored in-app experience to meet customers’ specific needs.

“Today’s news is a significant step forward in our mission to […] help them on their financial journey,” Kerbrat stated.

In addition to staking, Robinhood Crypto will soon launch localized versions of its app, starting with Italy, Poland, and Lithuania. These versions will offer the full range of services in local languages, giving users more confidence and comfort as they research investments and place trades.
In a separate development, Vlad Tenev, Robinhood CEO, announced that the company had hit $5 billion in equities trading volume today.


“One of our biggest days in the past 12 months,” Tenev said.

Many link Robinhood’s recent achievement to the resurgence in stock market interests, particularly GameStop (GME). Keith Gill, a financial analyst popularly known as The Roaring Kitty, initiated the price surge.
Following the news, Robinhood’s stock (HOOD) showed positive performance. HOOD’s price has been up 6.69% today and is trading at $18.02 at the time of writing.

Last week, Robinhood also announced an impressive performance in the first quarter of 2024. In its latest quarterly earnings report, Robinhood stated that it had a substantial increase in crypto assets under custody, which stood at $26 billion by the end of March. This represents a 78% rise from the end of 2023.
Despite these developments, Robinhood now faces increased scrutiny from the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). BeInCrypto previously reported that the SEC had issued a Wells notice regarding potential violations concerning Robinhood’s crypto practices.
The notice issuance could lead to enforcement actions. However, Robinhood’s leadership remains committed to defending the company’s business practices.

Cardano Founder Charles Hoskinson Accuses Biden Administration Of Attempting To 'Kill Crypto' - Benzinga

Charles Hoskinson, founder of Cardano, recently sounded off on President Joe Biden regarding his current stance on cryptocurrency, specifically as it pertains to the upcoming presidential election. Hoskinson was a member of the founding team of ethereum before leaving to focus on developing a new blockchain called Cardano. The blockchain prioritizes creating social change by providing use cases that will benefit society. Don't Miss:Hoskinson started a broadcast on X on May 9 to discuss "Biden and crypto." He promptly criticized the Biden administration, accusing it of actively seeking to "destroy the American cryptocurrency industry," and framing "a vote for Biden is a vote against the industry." The comments came after a veto from Biden on a recent resolution. The SEC's Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 121 (SAB 121) was up for debate in Congress, as a majority was hoping to reject the proposal to ease restrictions on bank's ability to interact with cryptocurrency. The proposal would force banks to report digital tokens held for customers on their balance sheets. This could arguably lead to huge increases in accounting costs, which could deter some banks from offering digital assets. Trending: 1 in 4 Americans own a share of Bitcoin according to NASDAQ, how much would $10 get you today?However, the rejection is expected to be ineffective, as the Biden administration has vowed to veto it, allowing the SEC to continue its work aimed at protecting investors in crypto-asset markets and safeguarding the broader financial system. The Biden administration goes on to say that SAB 121 was "issued in response to demonstrated technological, legal, and regulatory risks that have caused substantial losses to consumers." Hoskinson believes that the SEC is overstepping their bounds and is using largely outdated regulations to argue for its position. "The Securities Exchange Act passed in 1933, to say that it is sufficient to regulate assets that came 90 years later is an absurd statement," Hoskinson added.He went on to say that other countries, such as Singapore and Switzerland, have been much more welcoming to crypto, which has brought in huge amounts of investment and provided a boost to their economies. Additionally, he noted that many of the companies that are currently operating in other countries likely would have been operating "in the United States had our crypto policy been reasonable."When asked about Trump, he noted that, while the [Trump] administration had its issues, it mostly ignored our industry. "The Biden administration has engaged in a coordinated effort to kill crypto."As the November election approaches, the cryptocurrency industry could unexpectedly become an important topic for many voters. It will be interesting to see how the candidates continue to evolve their stances and how voters respond. Read Next:

FTX Collapse: Salame Requests Lenient Sentence, Claims Innocence


							

FTX’s Ryan Salame seeks an 18-month term, citing cooperation with authorities.



Legal team says Salame’s life and career are already deeply impacted by the FTX scandal.



His request comes after FTX founder Sam Bankman-Fried received a 25-year sentence.




Ryan Salame, a former executive at the now-bankrupt cryptocurrency exchange FTX, has requested a lenient 18-month prison sentence in connection with the fraud case surrounding the company’s collapse. Salame, who pleaded guilty to criminal fraud charges, is seeking leniency based on his cooperation with law enforcement and his allegedly lesser role in FTX’s operations.



On Tuesday, Salame’s legal team filed a sentencing memorandum outlining his responsibilities at FTX and Alameda Research. The memorandum emphasizes that Salame’s duties primarily focused on operational tasks such as overseeing customer wire deposits, fiat currency conversions, and leading charitable efforts in the Bahamas. His attorneys argue that this distanced him for the core fraudulent activities that ultimately led to the collapse of FTX.



The memorandum maintains that Salame was unaware of the alleged conspiracy among FTX and Alameda’s top leadership to mislead and steal from customers. “Mr. Salame did not steal from anyone. He did not lie to customers,” his attorneys stated. 



Salame’s legal team further asserts that he was himself deceived by his colleagues. Upon realizing the alleged fraud’s scope, Salame was reportedly the first to notify Bahamian authorities, transpiring their investigation into FTX.









Salame’s cooperation reportedly extended to voluntarily providing crucial documents to the U.S. Attorney’s Office voluntarily, without requiring a subpoena. His attorneys also highlight the ongoing media scrutiny and public criticism Salame faces as a form of lifelong punishment. They argue that his association with Sam Bankman-Fried and FTX will permanently damage his future employment prospects.



The request for leniency, comes after a federal court in the U.S. sentenced Sam Bankman-Fried to 25 years imprisonment for his role in the FTX fraud case. Like Salame, other former FTX executives, including Caroline Ellison and Gary Wang, have also pleaded guilty to charges. They are reportedly negotiating plea deals with U.S. authorities in exchange for reduced sentences.

Will Whales Trigger a Rally in Tron (TRX) Price?


At this point, Tron’s (TRX) price has been in an uptrend for more than three weeks, signaling a breakout above a key price level.
The whales’ minimal but consistent accumulation is pushing the price up, which will boost demand in the market.
Tron Whales Could Help Price Increase
Tron’s price has shown signs of being influenced by the impact of whale accumulation, and the same is happening now. The whale addresses holding TRX worth more than $100,000 and under $10 million have consistently added TRX to their wallets.
These addresses have accumulated over $160 million worth of TRX in the last month, bringing their total holdings close to year-to-date highs.

Additionally, the investors are also awaiting a crucial bullish signal that would increase the demand for the asset. According to the Global In/Out of the Money (GIOM) indicator, about 1.14 billion TRX are awaiting profits.
This supply was bought between $0.123 and $0.127 and is worth over $142 million. Although in comparison to Tron’s market capitalization of $11 billion, this supply is minimal, it is still gains that investors are waiting for.

When this supply becomes profitable, it will drive the demand for TRX, which will translate to a further increase in price.
TRX Price Prediction: Closer to ATH
Tron’s price trading at $0.125 is close to breaching the resistance at $0.127. Breaching this resistance would not only enable further rise but also turn the aforementioned supply profitable. This would, in effect, push the price upwards towards $0.130.

Flipping $0.130 in support would give Tron’s price the necessary boost to reach its all-time high of $0.144.

On the other hand, if the month-long uptrend line that Tron’s price has been above is lost, the altcoin could dip to $0.121. Losing this support level would invalidate the bullish thesis, sending TRX to $0.116.

The metaverse is coming straight to your web browser: Here’s how

Over the past few years, the metaverse has been increasingly gaining prominence in the mainstream, with companies like The Sandbox becoming recognizable names even beyond the realm of Web3.However, after the initial hype died down, onboarding new users remains a challenge for developers in the space who want to keep making digital reality, well, a reality. In a bid to make the metaverse more accessible and user-friendly, the Layer1 blockchain and metaverse protocol Somnia announced that it is bringing the metaverse straight into users’ web browser. On May 15, the protocol launched its Metaverse Browser, which was developed with a simplified and intuitive interface to make it more easy for new users to explore Web3 and create custom content. Paul Thomas, the founder of Somnia, said that they hope to set the stage for a more “inclusive and accessible metaverse.” “This platform is not only about simplifying technology but also about empowering individuals to explore and create without limits.”Thomas told Cointelegraph: “[Users] don’t need experience with Web3 wallets or even have a Web3 wallet installed to interact with the browser, all of that is abstracted for the user…This we hope will allow anyone to use it and be part of the metaverse and use Web3.”He highlighted that the browser also allows users the ability to create and deploy DApps within the Somnia ecosystem. This includes object creation tools, which will utilize artificial intelligence (AI) based generation tools to allow people to create objects easily even without 3D art experience.In the future, Thomas said that they are working on deploying a first-party marketplace to enable users to buy and sell their metaverse objects and avatars creating what we call the metaverse object economy.“Developers will have access to a software development kit that enables them to easily create apps for users to interact with the metaverse,” he said. “These apps could be anything from a profile viewer to a marketplace for the metaverse.”Related: This 360 treadmill could make Disney’s metaverse a physical playgroundSomnia even partnered with the Web3 media company Yuga Labs to offer exclusive rewards to holders of select Yuga Labs nonfungible token (NFT) collections. These users will get a bonus on any points earned during the Somnia Point Dream Hunt incentive campaign that rewards users for engaging with metaverse experiences.X said that he hopes such partnerships will “drive initial community engagement” and encourage some of the biggest communities in Web3 to try out having the metaverse in their browser. Yuga Labs is known for being a leader in bridging digital and physical reality, coining the term the “Yugaverse." It s the company behind iconic NFT collections such as Bored Ape Yacht Club, Mutant Apes, CryptoPunks and more. On April 26, Yuga Labs announced the start of a restructuring process following the appointment of Greg Solano as CEO two months earlier.Although the metaverse has been through a slump, the market is still projected to reach a value of $74.4 billion by the end of 2024, according to data from Statista. Its general path indicates that, even with conservative estimates, it is positioned for upward expansion. Magazine: Meme coins: Betrayal of crypto’s ideals… or its true purpose?

Post-FTX crypto industry needs education before regulation: Former Biden advisor

The cryptocurrency industry needs to prioritize investor education over stringent regulations as it recovers from the downfall caused by the collapse of the FTX exchange, which resulted in $8.9 billion in user funds lost.Financial education, especially regarding risk management, should be the fundamental concern of the crypto industry, according to Moe Vela, former senior advisor to President Joe Biden and senior advisor to Unicoin.Vela told Cointelegraph in an exclusive interview:“Education is the fundamental key to empowerment… We will not have equality in any form until we have economic parity. We’re not going to have economic parity until we teach people to be, instead of unsophisticated at anything, sophisticated, and that comes through education.”The senior advisor’s comments come a week after FTX’s new amended proposal was released on May 7, promising “billions in compensation” for the users and creditors of the bankrupt exchange who have been unable to access their funds since November 2022.The meltdown of FTX and its over 130 subsidiaries forced regulators to take action and develop investor-safety-oriented regulations, while the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) started a crackdown on crypto exchanges to avoid another FTX-like meltdown.However, instead of the regulatory efforts that may stifle digital asset innovation, the industry would benefit more from educating the unsophisticated investors, argued Vela:“To my fellow Democrats a bit to my left who are a little overzealous on regulation: Stop it. You're not doing anybody any favors. It might make you feel good because you think you’re protecting the unsophisticated investor, but rather than then having to over-regulate to protect the unsophisticated investor. Why don't we make the investors sophisticated?”Vela also serves as an advisor for Unicoin, an asset-backed cryptocurrency that aims to reduce the volatility associated with traditional cryptocurrencies. During the launch of the token, Vela learned that risk mitigation is among the most important factors for both traditional and crypto investors. He explained:VIDEOMoe Vela, interview with Cointelegraph. Source: CointelegraphRelated: Regulators are cracking down on financial privacy, but ZK-proofs can helpThe crypto industry is here to stay and regulators should take noteSince the crypto industry is becoming an integral part of our future, innovation-friendly regulations remain a key priority, according to Vela:“How do we create regulation that empowers, protects, and educates? But does not hinder the growth of this sector. Because this industry is here to stay. It is an integral part of our global future… So let’s foster smart growth and safe growth.”Following the collapse of FTX, crypto exchanges worldwide have been striving for more transparent operations, spearheaded by Binance, the world’s largest exchange, which could not escape the SEC’s hawkish stance.In June 2023, the SEC sued Coinbase and Binance Exchange for alleged securities violations. In the lawsuit against Binance, the SEC alleged that the company and its founder, Changpeng Zhao, had misappropriated billions of dollars of user funds.Despite no evidence of user fund misappropriation, Binance was charged with violating Anti-Money Laundering laws and settled to pay $4.3 billion, one of the largest criminal fines in history.This type of regulatory enforcement is in contrast with the innovation-friendly approach advocated by Vela, who said:“What I preach for is regulation that protects and prevents but does not cripple and destroy [innovation].”Related: GameStop tops Bitcoin's yearly gains in one day — Will GME spark an altcoin rally?

Chinese Authorities Smash $1.9 Billion Illegal Crypto Ring


On May 15, the Chengdu Public Security Bureau announced the dismantling of a vast underground banking network, arresting 193 suspects across China. 
These individuals were involved in illegal businesses utilizing crypto, specifically Tether (USDT). The comprehensive crackdown revealed illicit transactions totaling approximately 13.8 billion yuan (~$1.9 billion).
How Chinese Authorities Crack Down on Crypto Crimes
The investigation started in November 2022 when authorities detected suspicious activities involving underground banks in Chengdu’s Longquanyi District. Consequently, they formed a specialized task force, incorporating experts from various police departments. This also included economic investigation, cyber security, and legal affairs. 
This group provided unauthorized foreign exchange settlements, effectively bypassing national regulations.

On June 1, 2023, following directives from the Ministry of Public Security, the task force executed coordinated raids across several major cities, including Shanghai and Shenzhen. These efforts led to the capture of key figures in the criminal syndicate, such as Lin, Weng, and Chen, along with 25 others. 
During these raids, law enforcement seized a plethora of bank cards and digital payment instruments linked to criminal activities.
Further investigations uncovered that, since January 2021, the syndicate had exploited its import and export business to facilitate illegal activities. By using USDT as a medium, they circumvented official foreign exchange channels to service clients needing to transfer funds internationally. 

Moreover, these operations were intricately linked to other illicit activities, including financial fraud and smuggling.
Zhong Yu, captain of the Eighth Brigade of the Economic Investigation Detachment at the Chengdu Municipal Public Security Bureau, highlighted the complexity of the network. 

“The suspect settled funds through underground banks and was suspected of engaging in illegal foreign exchange criminal activities,” Yu said.


Also, on May 13, BeInCrypto reported that the Chinese government arrested six people. They are allegedly responsible for illicit crypto transactions worth $295 million. These arrests underline the challenges and risks associated with crypto in unregulated environments.

Meanwhile, the Hong Kong police recently apprehended three men at a currency exchange shop after a deceptive transaction involving Tether’s USDT. The suspects allegedly showed a customer ceremonial “hell money” before deceitfully persuading him to transfer about $128,073 worth of USDT, only to refuse the agreed-upon cash exchange afterward.

“Hell banknotes are a form of ceremonial paper money that is burned as an offering to ancestors or deities in traditional Chinese culture,” SCMP explains.

Bitcoin ‘danger zone’ is ‘officially over,’ What’s next for BTC?


Bitcoin (BTC) has navigated through its post-halving ‘danger zone,’ a period marked by heightened volatility and price corrections. 
Prominent crypto analyst Rekt Capital highlighted in an X (formerly Twitter) post that Bitcoin has now emerged from this challenging phase.
According to Rekt Capital‘s analysis, which considers historical data and recent market trends, Bitcoin is entering a reaccumulation phase. This transition suggests a potential upward trajectory in its market value and marks a significant phase in the cryptocurrency‘s cycle, indicating a shift towards growth and stabilization.

Following the recent Bitcoin halving event, the cryptocurrency experienced a significant price drop, declining 23% from its mid-March high of $65,000 to a low of $56,800 on May 1.
This period, known as the ‘danger zone,’ typically sees Bitcoin retreat in price as the market adjusts to the halved block rewards.
Rekt Capital noted that Bitcoin has rebounded from these lows, indicating that the asset has moved into a reaccumulation phase. He emphasized that Bitcoin had bounced back strongly from the low support levels of its reaccumulation range, suggesting the potential bottom of this period was reached on May 1.
Historical data supports this view, showing that Bitcoin typically experiences a decline around halving events. If $56,000 wasn’t the bottom, this year’s pullback at 63 days would match the longest in the cycle. However, Rekt Capital believes that the pullback concluded at $56,000 after 47 days.
Bullish signals and global economic factors
Adding to the positive outlook, prominent crypto analyst Ali Martinez highlighted a recent buy signal from the TD Sequential indicator on Bitcoin’s hourly chart, suggesting an impending upswing. 

The broader economic landscape also plays a crucial role in shaping Bitcoin’s trajectory. A major focus this week will be on the April Consumer Price Index (CPI), set to be released today.
Forecasts indicate a CPI of 3.4% and a core CPI of 3.6%, both figures well above the Federal Reserve’s (Fed) target of 2%. 
This persistent high inflation suggests that interest rates might remain elevated longer than previously expected, potentially impacting investor sentiment and financial markets.
Additionally, Raoul Pal, a renowned macro guru and CEO of Real Vision has identified the upcoming months as potentially advantageous for cryptocurrencies, describing a ‘banana zone‘—a period of enhanced global liquidity that historically correlates with strong performance in high-risk assets like Bitcoin.
This could mean that external economic conditions may align to further fuel Bitcoin’s ascent in the latter half of the year.
What’s next for BTC ?

At press time, Bitcoin is trading at $62,709, with a one-day change of 1.8%.
As Bitcoin exits the danger zone and indicators turn bullish, the market appears to be entering a phase of cautious optimism. The combination of technical indicators and macroeconomic factors suggests that Bitcoin could be gearing up for a significant rally in the latter part of the year.
However, investors are advised to keep an eye on global economic trends and market signals to gauge the potential impact on cryptocurrency prices.

Crucial Decision Coming for Bitcoin, Says Crypto Trader Michaël van de Poppe - Here’s His Outlook - The Daily Hodl


								A widely followed crypto strategist and trader says that it’s almost time for Bitcoin (BTC) to reveal its hand.
Analyst Michaël van de Poppe tells his 718,100 followers on the social media platform X that Bitcoin is at a point where it either attacks a new all-time high or sees another big sell-off event.










According to the trader, Bitcoin must hold its immediate support at $60,500 to have a shot at igniting a big burst to the upside. Otherwise, he predicts BTC heading close to $50,000.
“Crucial decision is approaching for Bitcoin.
The range low at $60,500-$61,000 is still holding up for Bitcoin, through which breaking $63,000 is the next barrier for a new run toward the all-time high.
If $60,500 is lost, I think we’ll see $52,000-$55,000 as the next support zone.” 
Source: Michaël van de Poppe/X
At time of writing, Bitcoin is worth $61,514, down nearly 2% in the last 24 hours.
The analyst is also keeping a close watch on the TOTAL2 chart, which traders use to track the altcoin markets as it measures the total market cap of crypto excluding Bitcoin and stablecoins. Van de Poppe says TOTAL2 may be a couple of weeks away from kicking off a new uptrend.
“One to two weeks of some more consolidation and we’re ready to reverse back upwards on the altcoin market capitalization.” 
Source: Michaël van de Poppe/X
Based on the trader’s chart, he seems to suggest that TOTAL2 is in the process of carving a bottom after holding support at $900 billion. At time of writing, TOTAL2 is trading at $970 billion.
Van de Poppe notes that traders are bearish on altcoins but the charts suggest they may be close to witnessing a trend reversal.
“Many altcoins are making double bottoms, where the likelihood of a rally has substantially increased.
On the contrary, the sentiment is at a cycle low as people expect further downward momentum to be happening.
Things can change quickly.”

S&P Global Rankings Urges Asset Managers To Embrace Tokenization - The Defiant

The esteemed credit rating agency argued that using public blockchains for tokenization offers significant efficiency benefits over legacy financial architecture.S&P Global Rankings, a leading credit rating agency, is bullish on tokenized real-world assets.In a May 14 report, S&P Global Ratings argues that asset tokenization offers numerous efficiency and operational benefits to asset managers and investors alike.“Tokenized Treasuries are digital tokens created on a blockchain that are backed by a portfolio of U.S. government obligations,” said Andrew O’Neill, digital assets managing director at S&P Global Ratings. “Tokenized Treasuries can help money market funds and their investors to manage liquidity… Longer term, tokenization may bring new efficiencies to the asset management industry.”The report argues that the launch of the BlackRock USD Institutional Digital Liquidity Fund (BUIDL), the tokenized U.S. treasuries fund from the world’s largest asset manager, in mid-March accelerated the trend of real-world asset (RWA) tokenization.Indeed, the tokenized U.S. treasury market has grown 83.6% to more than $1.27 billion from $695 million on March 19 — the day before BUIDL began accepting investments, according to Rwa.xyz.BUIDL’s rapid rise pushed the value of the sector above $1B one week after launching, with the fund currently ranking as the largest tokenized treasuries product with $381 million. Franklin Templeton’s ’s OnChain U.S. Government Money Fund (FOBXX) ranks second with $359.6 million.Capitalization of tokenized treasuries funds. Source: Rwa.xyzEthereum hosts two-thirds of the sector’s capitalization, followed by Stellar with 28.5%, and Solana with 3.66%.Opportunities for TradFiO’Neil asserts that tokenized funds offer significant benefits addressing shortcomings of their analogue counterparts.The report says that the risk of funds suffering bank runs are mitigated by investors having “round-the-clock” access to on-chain liquidity. It noted that BUIDL allows investors to redeem their shares for USDC stablecoins at any time via smart contract execution — bypassing the need for intermediaries.Shares representing as tokens can also be used as liquid collateral, meaning shareholders do not need to redeem their assets to access their value to use as collateral. Franklin Templeton recently enabled peer-to-peer transfers of FOBXX shares, enabling new use cases for the tokens.The report acknowledged that many financial institutions have previously explored tokenization through private chains, but said public networks offer significant liquidity advantages over permissioned networks. “Banks' tokenization efforts have mainly used private permissioned blockchains, supporting operational efficiencies but not a liquid market in tokenized products,” O’Neil said.On-chain treasuries also provide efficiency advantages and accelerated settlement for businesses moving assets across borders, such as multinational corporations.O’Neil added that tokenized RWAs benefit on-chain businesses by enabling them to access legacy assets and real-world yields without having to move their assets off-chain.“Previously, crypto-related businesses that earn revenues and pay expenses on-chain have had to choose between investing their cash in riskier on-chain assets or moving it off-chain to invest in traditional cash-equivalent products,” O-Neil said. “This ‘off and on-ramping’ process is costly and inefficient. Tokenized Treasuries provide an on-chain solution backed by assets with high liquidity and credit quality.”Challenges aheadDespite O’Neil’s optimism for the tokenized RWA sector, the report acknowledges that on-chain funds still face significant challenges in the form of regulation and interoperability.“Emerging regulatory frameworks in key jurisdictions will enhance investors' appetite to engage with stablecoins and the features they enable,” he said. “Institutions need to connect their legacy systems to those blockchains… In the short term, interoperability challenges will limit the growth of tokenization.”

Bitcoin Wind is Blowing in Canada! Million Dollar BTC Investment Received from Two Banking Giants! - Bitcoin Sistemi


Bitcoin has started to blow in Canada, which is known for its strict regulations and approach towards cryptocurrencies.
At this point, while Canadian banking giants entered the US spot Bitcoin ETF arena with investments of millions of dollars, two of the country's largest banks, Scotia Bank and Toronto Dominion Bank (TD Bank), announced that they invested in spot BTC ETFs.


Banking giants disclosed exposure to US spot Bitcoin ETFs in recent SEC filings.
Scotiabank announced that they have invested more than $1.5 million in three major Bitcoin ETFs: BlackRock-IBIT, Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) and Fidelity-FBTC.





TD Bank, Canada's second largest bank, also announced that it invested $2.18 million in BlackRock-IBIT and ProShares Bitcoin Strategy ETF (BITO).
Although the investment by Canadian banking giants is relatively small compared to other investments, it represents an important step for Canadian banks.


At this point, analysts said these ETF investments point to increased institutional confidence in Bitcoin in the country, despite its historical volatility and regulatory scrutiny in Canada.

Bitcoin spot exchange-traded funds (ETFs) continued to attract investor interest on May 14, with total net inflows into these funds reached $100.5 million, highlighting ongoing demand for direct exposure to Bitcoin BTC/USD.What Happened: This positive inflow comes despite a single-day net outflow of $50.93 million from Grayscale‘s industry-leading Bitcoin Investment Trust GBTC, according to data from SoSoValue.However, this outflow was offset by a significant net inflow of $133 million into Ark Invest and 21Shares‘ ARKB ETF.

We believe that all content is accurate as of the date of publication, but certain offers mentioned may no longer be available.



Dogecoin whales are finally waking up, as IntoTheBlock's indicators suggest. With the return of buying power on the market, DOGE might receive a necessary boost.The first chart shows DOGE/USDT on the daily time frame. DOGE is trading at around $0.1492, displaying a relatively stable consolidation pattern. The price is currently at several key moving averages:50-day EMA: This is currently acting as a resistance level around $0.1652. A breakout above this level could signal the beginning of a bull market.100-day EMA: This line is providing support around $0.1434, suggesting that DOGE has a cushion against further declines.200-day EMA: At $0.1237, this serves as a significant long-term support level.The volume profile does show some activity but not significant activity. The RSI is at 46, suggesting that DOGE is in a neutral zone, neither overbought nor oversold, which provides room for potential price movement in either direction.Dogecoin/USDT Chart by TradingViewCharts from IntoTheBlock provide some additional insights. Over the past month, there has been a notable increase in the number of large transactions, peaking at 1.86K transactions on May 14, 2024. This surge in large transactions indicates heightened activity from large holders or institutional investors.The volume of these large transactions also saw a significant spike, reaching 11.55 billion DOGE on the same day. This increase in large transaction volume suggests substantial movement of DOGE tokens, likely reflecting strategic positioning by whales.Bullish scenario: If the increased whale activity leads to substantial buying pressure, DOGE could break above the 50-day EMA at $0.1652, targeting higher resistance levels around $0.18 and $0.20.Bearish scenario: Conversely, if the whales are offloading their holdings, DOGE could face selling pressure, leading to a test of support levels at $0.1434 (100-day EMA) and $0.1237 (200-day EMA).

Importance of Privacy and Security in SocialFi Platforms

Social Media is the lifeline of today’s generation. Creators are making money from social media as much as consuming it. There are about 5.6 billion social media users in 2024 and the creator economy is expected to generate $22.8 billion worldwide in 2024. 
However, creators face the problem of lack of data ownership and autonomy. Companies like Facebook and Instagram own the users’ data creating privacy issues. This is where SocialFi stepped in years ago promising Privacy and Security in SocialFi revolution.
Right now, applications like the SuperDapp built on top of Syscoin the Layer-zero Bitcoin chain bring along a robust set of privacy and security measures such as self-custody asset management to SocialFi. These measures give users full ownership of their assets and reduce any counter-party risks
The whole concept of SocialFi is about integrating social media applications with the decentralized network. SocialFi prioritizes user ownership of their content, ensures monetary benefits to creators and enables direct interactions with your favorite musicians, artists, celebrities, etc. Combining these elements SocialFi creates a decentralized and user-centric environment for the Web3 world. 
As we approach a higher point in the adoption curve of SocialFi along come some challenges of privacy and security in SocialFi. In this article, we will understand those challenges and how applications like SuperDapp tackle them and build more and more trust in the Web3 world. 

Read this article from the experts at DroomDroom explaining how blockchain has empowered, emerging artists and eased their communications with fans. 

How Does SocialFi Work?
SocialFi disrupted the traditional structure of Web2 social media platforms like Facebook, Instagram, X (formerly Twitter), etc. It achieves this by enabling users’ control over their interactions rather than algorithms controlling them and enabling them to earn income based on the value of content they share on the platform.
SocialFi is a decentralized social media platform that combines elements of decentralized finance (DeFi) and social networking. It operates on a model similar to Patreon’s Web2, where content creators such as artists, musicians, and writers connect directly with their audience.
Furthermore, users on SocialFi platforms have multiple earning opportunities based on their engagement and following. There are no restrictions on what can be monetized, so users have the freedom to earn from various sources.

Decentralized Autonomous Organizations (DAOs) play quite an important role in managing the privacy and security of SocialFi platforms. The DAOs are responsible for the governance of the platform and for ensuring that there is no central authority controlling user activity on the networks. 
These act as regulatory bodies and also prevent developers and other teams from modifying the platforms’ code. This means that every decision such as sharing incentive is will go through a vote on the DAO.
The platforms’ monetization depends on social DeFi tokens which are either native tokens or other traded assets on the platform. In addition to in-app tokens, content creators can develop their own tokens which they can use to monetize their social interactions with their fans.
Since the platforms are decentralized, users can choose which creators to engage with and must hold a creator’s token to engage. These tokens make it possible to incentivize engagement with creators and reward affiliate programs.
Additionally, when we talk about digital ownership, it means that creators can use PFP NFTs to prove their identity and track digital content ownership through other NFTs. This model makes it easier for creators to monetize anything they post, including messages, GIFs, blogs, photos and music. Creators can earn more revenue through advertising, which is fairly distributed on SocialFi networks.
All good till now right?, Here comes a spoiler and to warn you, it’s not a good one. Each coin has two sides and vulnerability is the other side of blockchain technology.The blockchain network extensively uses smart contracts. For pre-defined execution of money transfers or token transfers based on the number of likes a creator gets, there have to be some rules embedded in the technology. These rules are a set of smart contracts themselves and the problem is that these are vulnerable to security breaches just as much as the DeFi sector is separately. 
The threats of cyber attacks create a vulnerability in upholding the platform’s integrity and safeguarding users’ assets. Let’s understand these challenges and how Dapps like SuperDapp solve this challenge. 
Privacy and Security in SocialFi
A diagram illustrating the evolution of the web labeled Web 1.0, Web 2.0, and Web 3.0.
Privacy in Web3 is often discussed in terms of data sovereignty, where individuals have ownership of their personal information and decide who can access it. This creates a shift that could lead to a future where personal data isn’t used for advertising purposes. In Web3 users can participate in online ecosystems without exposing unnecessary information.
However, achieving privacy and security in SocialFi Web3 is a complex challenge. While blockchain technology provides transparency and security through immutability, it also poses many privacy risks because public blockchains by design are visible to all. This means that even pseudonymous transactions can be tracked and analyzed for patterns and other data points. 
In order to reduce these challenges, Web3 projects are exploring a range of privacy-enhancing techniques, like zero-knowledge proofs and confidential transactions which allow for verification of data without revealing sensitive details. 

When talking about challenges, not all blockchains are public, some blockchains are public and some are private. Experts at DroomDroom have explained it brilliantly with this article. 

How SuperDapp Preserves and Protects Privacy?
In the Web3 world digital security and privacy and security in SocialFi world are more crucial than ever and Syscoin blockchain-based SuperDapp offers a solution that redefines how we interact with our digital assets. Built on the innovative Rollux technology, Super Dapp’s self-custody wallet is designed to provide users with complete control over their cryptocurrencies and digital assets.
This approach ensures that your data remains yours—secure, private and free from centralized control.

Read this article to understand in depth how the rise of non-custodial wallets has created a space of safety in the blockchain world.

Some of the other ways in which SuperDapp preserves the privacy of its users are – 
Layer-Zero Bitcoin chain
SuperDapp secures itself through the power of Syscoin, the Layer-Zero Bitcoin chain. Syscoin inherits Bitcoin’s robust Proof-of-Work consensus mechanism making it extremely difficult to tamper with SuperDapp’s data.

Transactions on both chains are immutable, further guaranteeing the integrity of information stored on SuperDapp. Syscoin adds another layer of security. Breaching SuperDapp would require compromising the security level of the Bitcoin blockchain, a near-impossible feat.
Your Keys, Your Control
Yes, you heard it right!
Even to this date, there are some crypto platforms in the SocialFi space that control your private keys. However, SuperDapp’s self-custody wallet lets you manage your keys without relying on anyone else. This makes you the custodian of your digital assets handing you the power to buy, sell and transfer your funds.
Multi-Signature 
SuperDapp goes beyond basic security measures such as encryption and self-custody of assets. It offers advanced features that are both secure and easy to use. The multi-signature functionality lets you add extra security by requiring multiple approvals for certain actions. 

“Its user-friendly interface makes it easy to manage your crypto even if you’re not a tech expert. This balance between security and ease of use is what makes SuperDapp stand out”
Jagdeep Sidhu, CEO of SYS Labs

Strict Non-Disclosure Policy
SuperDapp has a zero-disclosure policy. They will not share user data with anyone unless required by a court order.
Advanced Encryption & Secure Connections
Adding to the list of security features, the platform employs multiple encryption algorithms like AES 256, RSA and Elliptic Curve to protect user data and has multiple SSL/TLS protocols in place to create secure connections. 
Multi-factor authentication & Zero-Knowledge Proofs
SuperDapp uses blockchain technology and Zero-knowledge proofs to encrypt user data and all their communications. SuperDapp offers an optional multi-factor authentication (MFA) as an extra layer of security.
The platform’s commitment to bringing privacy and security in SocialFi is further demonstrated through its collaboration with Fort Knoxer which is a leading crypto security company. Through this partnership, Syscoin ensures that the latest security protocols and privacy-enhancing technologies are integrated into the platform offering you users the peace of mind to have a safe and private conversation with your loved ones. 

Zero-Knowledge proofs are like a magician’s act when it comes to blockchain. Read this article to understand Zk-SNARKs which are a type of non-interactive ZK-Proofs. 

Conclusion
Privacy and security in SocialFi is essential because of the inherent nature of blockchains. Blockchains are designed to be public and transparent, which means anyone from the world can view the entire history of transactions executed on a particular chain. However, this has become problematic to the web3 world as there is some personal and sensitive information stored on the blockchain when it comes to SocialFi. 
This dilemma of the “Blockchain Privacy Paradox” is being solved by modern-age applications like SuperDapp. SuperDapp, based on Rollux addresses this issue with an end-to-end encrypted suite of communication. Additionally, it provides a layer of security along with the use Zero- Knowledge proofs and MFAs. 
The hope for privacy and security in SocialFi space is filled with optimism in the year 2024 with such applications and with the creator economy booming, blockchain technology is at the very right place to on-board the latest generation of users with its new-to-age benefits.

Does Trump care about crypto? Bitcoin is latest battleground in US election

Americans will head to the polls on Nov. 5 to select their next president. The upcoming elections are expected to be a tight race amid increased polarization among voters and generally meager voter turnout. With election day drawing nearer, presidential candidates are competing for the public’s trust and offering promises of a brighter future.Now, cryptocurrency has been caught up in the mix.Former President Donald Trump seems to have pivoted on crypto, adopting a more conciliatory stance and promising a “good and solid” future for the cryptocurrency industry in the United States.However, is Trump really “orange-pilled,” or is he just turning crypto into another partisan political football to secure votes as election day draws closer?Trump’s opinion on crypto changesDuring his presidency, Trump was generally critical of cryptocurrencies. He offered up many of the common criticisms coming from politicians, namely that crypto is “based on thin air” and used for drugs and other illicit activities.Source: Donald TrumpHowever, as the 2024 elections approach, Trump has shifted his narrative. On May 8, during an event for holders of his nonfungible tokens (NFTs) at his Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida, he surprised the crypto community by accusing President Joseph Biden and the current head of the Securities and Exchange Commission, Gary Gensler, of conspiring against cryptocurrencies, while presenting his candidacy as the alternative for pro-crypto voters.


Crypto community criticizes Biden’s policyTrump’s recent pledge to become a crypto crusader follows the Biden administration’s threat to veto the H.J.Res. 109 SEC crypto bill, which would allow U.S.-regulated financial institutions to custody cryptocurrencies.Influential crypto advocates have come out in support of the bill, including Ethereum co-founder and Cardano founder Charles Hoskinson, who accused Biden’s presidency of hurting the “industry in every way possible.”


In a recent post, Hoskinson mentioned that Trump’s administration “mostly ignored” the crypto industry while “the Biden administration has engaged in a coordinated effort to kill crypto.” “A vote for Biden is a vote against the American cryptocurrency industry.”Ryan Selkis, founder and CEO of blockchain analytics firm Messari, claimed that if Biden is reelected, the crypto industry will face a slew of hostile regulations.Source: Ryan SelkisTrump has picked up on the crypto community’s dissatisfaction with Biden, claiming that “crypto is moving out of the U.S. because of hostility toward crypto.” To stop the migration of the crypto industry from the U.S., “we have to let them be here,” Trump said.Does Trump actually care about crypto?While some in the crypto community have already declared allegiance to Trump, others are more cynical about the former president’s motivations.Mónica Taher, the former tech and business innovation director for the government of El Salvador, told Cointelegraph that crypto is “being utilized by some opportunistic politicians to elevate their status and present themselves as innovators.” Reader: MakerDAO and Aave’s DeFi conflict reopens over DAI’s perceived risk growthTaher believes that Trump is a clear example of this opportunism, as he was “initially against cryptocurrencies but now, due to his financial troubles, is even accepting donations in this manner,” as Trump confirmed at his NFT holder event.Trump’s campaign has been hemorrhaging money as it pays to defend the former president against 91 felony counts in two state courts and two federal districts. Crypto could provide a way for the cash-strapped campaign to receive new funding.Andrew M. Bailey, co-author of Resistance Money and a fellow at the Bitcoin Policy Institute, told Cointelegraph that he believes “Trump has picked up” the reactive response generated by Senator Elizabeth Warren’s and the Biden administration’s aggressive approach against the crypto sector. Bailey said Trump’s new pro-crypto stance “falls within the familiar pattern of saying something positive about crypto, promising to foster innovation, and moving on.” However, he believes that “though his latest bid to court the crypto vote is vague, it might just prove effective no matter how insincere or fuzzy it is.”Taher, who has significant experience working closely with politicians, advised to trust only those who genuinely educate their constituents about this new monetary system, as “the primary focus should be on financial inclusion rather than a mere marketing ploy.”Crypto holder’s votes could be relevant in swing statesRegardless of the former president’s motivations, Trump may soon find himself with a new voting block.On March 14, Paradigm published a poll that showed that 19% of registered U.S. voters have bought crypto, concluding that “a fifth of the country is not a niche subgroup.”Paradigm’s poll further shows that crypto holders are willing to change parties. According to the survey, 48% of respondents support Trump in 2024, but only 39% voted for him in 2020. This may prove crucial to turning the tide in so-called “swing states” where the election’s outcome is far from certain. Due to their competitive nature, swing states receive significant attention and campaign resources from both parties during elections. As Paradigm writes:“This data collectively shows that crypto owners are themselves a swing vote demographic, one that could be decisive if the election is yet another razor-thin race.”On May 7, the Digital Currency Group (DCG) published a survey in partnership with The Harris Poll titled “Crypto Attitudes in the Swing States.” The poll collected data from Michigan, Nevada, Ohio, Montana, Pennsylvania and Arizona.The study revealed an active desire to vote, with 93% of voters claiming they planned to vote in the upcoming elections. This data point is particularly important for a country traditionally known for its low voter turnout rates. Additionally, 74% of the voters considered themselves to be politically engaged.These voters are nearly evenly divided politically, with 43% leaning Republican and 45% leaning Democrat. Party lean within surveyed voters. Source: Harris PollBut crypto is far from the only issue on the ballot this November. Will a presidential candidate’s position on crypto be critical to earning their victory?According to the DGC survey, 26% of respondents said they pay attention to a candidate’s stance on crypto, and 21% said crypto is a significant issue to consider during the upcoming election.Respondents’ overall position on crypto could be attributed to a feeling of overregulation: 55% are concerned that policymakers will stifle innovation with excessive regulation. Venture capitalist Tim Draper told Cointelegraph:“America was known for freedom, and now we are known for inconsistent, unfair, abusive regulation.”Overwhelmingly, 83% of respondents wished legislators understood crypto before regulating it.Recent: DeFi may struggle to stay decentralized after new EU lawDraper echoed this concern, critiquing regulators’ lack of knowledge and assuring that he believes “most of the people trying to regulate crypto don’t even have a crypto wallet.” The November elections are still nearly six months away, so there is plenty of time for candidates’ positions to change or for Trump’s legal troubles to further develop. If Trump wants to create a decisive voting block of crypto holders, he will have to convince voters he is a true advocate, such as by offering concrete plans for crypto.Otherwise, it could become merely one more politician’s empty promise.

Worldcoin beefs up security by open-sourcing biometric data system

As organizations increasingly rely on biometric data for various applications, from access to physical spaces to financial services, the frequency and impact of data breaches continue to escalate. On May 15, the Worldcoin Foundation, the organization behind the Worldcoin iris biometric cryptocurrency project, announced that it open-sourced its secure multi-party computation (SMPC) system. The new SMPC system, which is responsible for encrypting iris codes into secret shares held by multiple parties, enables the Worldcoin Foundation to permanently delete iris codes generated through its previous uniqueness-checking system.Remco Bloemen, the head of protocol at Worldcoin Foundation, told Cointelegraph that this development, open-sourcing the SMPC system, offers a potential solution for “enhanced biometric data security.”"With the development and open sourcing of a new secure multi-party computation (SMPC) system, Worldcoin Foundation aims to continue to increase the robustness of the Worldcoin protocol while also setting a new standard for security. "The Worldcoin Foundation said that its SMPC approach is even effective against quantum computing. A report by Fortune Business Insights released on April 29 predicted that the global biometric system market will grow from $30.77 billion in 2022 to $76.70 billion by 2029. Meanwhile, research from MIT’s Stuart Madnick revealed that there has been a significant rise (20%) in data breaches between 2022 and 2023, with the number of affected individuals doubling.Related: Worldcoin: Should you let Sam Altman scan your eyeballs for WLD?Worldcoin Foundation data protection officer Jannick Preiwisch, said the Worldcoin community is committed to developing and deploying advanced privacy-focused technologies to improve trust online and increase access to the global economy. “The development of this new system demonstrates an unparalleled commitment to further compliance with the EU General Data Protection Regulation and other data protection regimes across the world.”He said it also “complements” the company’s intention to provide its users more of a choice — and control — as to where their data is going, including personal custody and the ability to un-verify their World IDs.Worldcoin has previously found itself in hot water with regulators around the world — and in Europe in particular with its GDPR measures — over its practices with user data. However, it has since taken measures to signal its willingness to comply. In March 2024, it made the software of its iris-scanning Orb open-source and implemented a new “personal custody” privacy feature for user data.A month later, in April, it said it would be tightening privacy checks and allowing users to un-verify their World ID. At the beginning of this year, Worldcoin saw new milestones for its active daily user count, which soared past one million for its wallet app. It also saw its token WLD surge by 141%.

Ethereum ETF Dreams Dashed? Analyst Says SEC Approval 'Slim to None'


								For investors hoping for a simple way to gain exposure to Ethereum, the road seems paved with regulatory hurdles. The US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has thrown a wrench into plans for spot Ethereum Exchange Traded Funds (ETFs), leaving the future of these investment vehicles shrouded in uncertainty.

Security Or Commodity? The Ethereum Classification Conundrum
The crux of the issue lies in the SEC’s classification of Ethereum (ETH) itself. Bloomberg analysts, including Eric Balchunas, believe the SEC views ETH as a security, not a commodity – and that the chances of its ETF getting the regulator’s nod is “slim to none.”
This distinction is crucial because commodity ETFs are generally easier to get approved than security ETFs. The SEC’s recent inquiries regarding whether ETF proposals qualify under commodity regulations seem to support this view.


Additionally, according to Bloomberg analyst James Seyffart, the SEC is more likely to drop Ethereum ETFs now that it has termed ETH a security once more.
The back-and-forth with extended review periods for ETF applications from Invesco Galaxy (decision by July 5th) and Franklin Templeton (decision by June 11th) paints a picture of a cautious regulator.


Potential Impact: A Tale Of Two Futures
The SEC’s eventual decision will have a ripple effect on the Ethereum ecosystem. If classified as a security, stricter regulations could follow, potentially hindering Ethereum’s growth and innovation. Conversely, a commodity classification could pave the way for easier ETF approvals, potentially attracting new investors and boosting mainstream adoption.
Ethereum is now trading at $2900. Chart: TradingView
Price Poised For Takeoff… Or Turbulence?
The uncertainty surrounding the SEC’s decision is already impacting the Ethereum price. The possibility of a rejection and stricter regulations could deter investors, leading to a drop in market confidence. On the other hand, a commodity classification could lead to a surge in investor interest through easier ETF access, potentially driving the price upwards.

More Than Just An Investment Vehicle: A Battle For Crypto’s Future
The SEC’s stance on Ethereum ETFs goes beyond just a single investment product. It represents a broader battleground for the future of cryptocurrency regulation in the US.
A clear and transparent regulatory framework is essential for fostering innovation and protecting investors in this rapidly evolving space.

Consumer prices were 3.4% higher in April than they were this time last year. That's a marked slow down in rising prices compared to March's 3.7%, according to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics.Immediately after BLS released its new Consumer Price Index data, the Bitcoin price now stands at $63,142, CoinGecko data shows. That’s a 3% gain in the past 24-hour period and 1.4% higher than it was an hour ago.And the price of Ethereum, the second-biggest digital asset by market cap, is now $2,944.94—which is a 1.8% increase compared to this time yesterday and 2% hours than it was an hours ago.The CPI report measures price changes in a basket of common consumer goods and services and is used to estimate changes in the economy’s inflation rate. In today's report, which contains data for consumer prices in April, the BLS reported that housing and gas prices were the two biggest factors in rising prices."Combined, these two indexes contributed over seventy percent of the monthly increase in the index for all items," the BLS wrote in its summary.Economists initially expected the Fed to lower interest rates early this year but now many think a cut will come by September, a Reuters survey showed this week.U.S. equities—particularly tech stocks—rose, with the NASDAQ-100 Technology Sector Index (NDXT)

Here's Why Bitcoin (BTC) Suddenly Surged to $64,000

The price of Bitcoin (BTC), the leading cryptocurrency, topped the $64,000 level earlier this Wednesday.  This came after the most recent consumer price index (CPI), which was released by the United States Department of Labor earlier today, dipped to 3.4% on a year-over-year basis. This is in line with analysts' expectations, which explains why the price of the largest cryptocurrency experienced a substantial price increase. That said, a lower CPI reading would have probably triggered a more powerful price spike.Traders in index swaps are now leaning toward a faster pace of rate cuts after the most recent CPI data. The Federal Reserve is expected to decrease borrowing costs in September and December.  A looser monetary policy will, of course, positively affect risk assets like Bitcoin. U.S. stock futures have also jumped following the inflation data,  with the S&P 500 futures adding 26 points.

FTX Extends Deadline for Creditor Claims amidst Refund Promise and Distribution Concerns | Coinspeaker



In a bid to offer creditors enough time to file their claims, FTX Digital Markets has decided to extend the deadline for submitting proof of debt.

FTX, the bankrupt cryptocurrency exchange, has earlier promised to refund its creditors and customers in cash within 60 days of court approval. While this initiative has received positive reviews from some members of the crypto community, others have raised some concerns as they remain skeptical about the distribution process.
Extended Deadline for Proof of Debt Submissions
In a bid to allow creditors enough time to file their claims, FTX Digital Markets has decided to extend the deadline for submitting proof of debt. In a post shared on X by Sunil, an FTX creditor activist, it was revealed that the initial date for submission of the Proof of Debt was May 15, 2024. However, it has now been extended by 10 to 12 weeks, allowing customers to submit a claim in the Bahamas process. The report stated that the new bar date, which is yet to be fixed, will align with the creditors’ voting deadline, allowing them to approve a Chapter 11 reorganization plan in the US process.






Customers of the default FTX are only permitted to participate in either the Bahamas or US process. These two processes refer to two separate legal proceedings related to the bankruptcy of FTX, designed to address the financial obligations of the collapsed crypto exchange. The terms for participating in either of the processes will be filled out to customers by next month, and they have 6 to 8 weeks from the date that disclosures are issued to decide which of the processes they would like to follow. Although there may be a few differences between the two methods, customers should still worry less as distribution will be equivalent and will occur at the same time.
Addressing Complexities: Lessons from the Cryptopia Case
It could be recalled that recently, FTX Estate, an asset and liability of the default crypto exchange, stated that it expects to have between $14.5 and 16.3 billion in cash available for distribution to customers by the time the Delaware bankruptcy court approves a reorganization plan. Despite FTX promising a refund and rolling out a payment approach, customers are already getting frustrated about the delay and ongoing complexities surrounding the FTX bankruptcy.
A crypto analyst, Thomas Braziel, with over 16 thousand followers, took to his X page to express skepticism surrounding FTX payments. He said that should the terms of service be upheld, it’s evident that the customer’s balance does not tally with the asset listed in the debtor’s petition at the time of the FTX bankruptcy filing, resulting in insufficient funds to pay everyone. Thomas then suggested a possible solution to this complexity by citing the Cryptopia case under New Zealand and UK law, where each type of asset was treated as a separate asset. He said:
“Each silo must be filled first, and any excess is shared with other silos. Deficiencies in a silo result in an “excess loss claim” that is dollarized, and these claims share ‘pari passu’ in any un-siloed and excess property from a particular silo.”
Creditors and customers of the collapsed exchange will be watching and anticipating the disclosure document with keen interest. However, the whole process will likely take more time before it materializes.

Rare sats and Runes failed to solve Bitcoin’s security budget


The Bitcoin halving was supposed to be a day of celebration and the end to Bitcoin’s woes of the prior four years. On that late Friday night (and in technical, computer geek UTC time, a party-perfect date of 4/20), Bitcoin turned the page to its fifth epoch.
Fans cheered the end of its 28-month-long bear market and waved goodbye to the fourth epoch’s 6.25 BTC block reward, welcoming a halved inflation rate of just 3.125 BTC per block. They hoped that the disinflationary shock might boost the price, and usher in a suite of upgrades to Bitcoin’s functionality that would fund a wellspring for its security budget.
Unfortunately, reality has failed to live up to their expectations. The price of bitcoin hasn’t rallied since the halving, nor has the halving increased Bitcoin’s security budget.
A cornucopia of new activity was supposed to arise from a suite of Bitcoin-branded protocols at the halving. This was to be based on Ordinals, a software program that pretends to track satoshis, the smallest denomination of 1 BTC.
Ordinals were supposed to empower active secondary markets for numismatics (collectible markets for unique satoshis or ‘rare sats’) and enable permanent data storage and on-chain software with inscriptions. Most importantly, they were designed to underpin Runes, a brand new fungible token protocol for trading ERC20-like tokens and meme coins on Bitcoin.
Buy the rumor, sell the news
All of those fantastic debuts have lifted Bitcoin’s USD-denominated miner’s revenue — the definitive measure of the blockchain’s security budget against real-world adversaries — exactly nowhere.

At block 840,000, Casey Rodarmor’s highly anticipated Runes protocol launched to fanfare and prompted the largest-ever amount of money paid for a single block in Bitcoin’s history: 74 BTC ($4.7 million). A single satoshi, the so-called ‘epic sat’ number 1,968,750,000,000,000, resold at auction for $2.1 million.
It was a promising start. Just imagine, fans of Rodarmor thought: a single satoshi (commonly valued at 1/100 millionth of bitcoin’s current price, $62,000) reselling for millions of dollars. 
However, there’s no free lunch. Only a small amount of speculative new money actually entered the secondary markets for these collectible satoshis. As a result, Ordinals, Inscriptions, Rare Sats, and Runes traders could no longer afford to continually overpay miners for on-chain transaction fees.
Runes failed to help Bitcoin’s security budget
Fees from this nascent community — heralded as the leading source of revenue for Bitcoin’s security budget post-halving — have evaporated. Runes, like so many Bitcoin-branded projects for creating altcoins before it, failed to sustain its hype for even two days after the halving. 
In all, bitcoin miners’ revenue is down 75% since the halving. Worse, Bitcoin’s security budget (approximately $30 million daily) is now lower than miners’ median revenue this year (approximately $50 million daily).

The chart of Bitcoin’s security budget says it all. In the run-up to the halving, excitement swelled about a supposed new era for Bitcoin. Fans cheered the rising transaction fees, which spiked on the day of the halving. Traders spent millions to buy satoshis commonly valued at 1/100 millionth of 1 BTC and gladly overpaid miners with obscene transaction fees. 
Less than one month later, all of their bids have made no difference to Bitcoin’s ongoing security budget. Runes failed its fans. As of today, neither Ordinals, Inscriptions, Numismatics, or any other protocol for trading satoshis have lifted Bitcoin’s security budget above its prior average.

Bitcoin Price (BTC) Gains More Than 1% After Soft Inflation Data

The consistent slide in inflation in 2023 had most, including the U.S. Federal Reserve, coming into 2024 expecting appreciably easier monetary policy throughout the year. Instead, inflation has actual risen a bit thus far this year. Along with an economy that continues to grow, it's put the kibosh on the thought of any imminent central bank rate cuts. Coming into Wednesday's CPI report, the odds of a summer rate cut by the Fed were low and traders had priced in just a 50% chance of move in September, according to the CME FedWatch Tool.

Circle, Behind USDC, Eyes US Listing with Headquarters Move


							

Circle’s relocation to the US hints at regulatory alignment pre-IPO, potentially enhancing investor confidence.



Tax implications highlight shifting dynamics in global tax policies impacting multinational corporations.



USDC’s resilience amidst challenges underscores the stability and utility of stablecoins in crypto markets.




Circle Internet Financial Ltd., the issuer of the widely-used stablecoin USDC, announced its intention to relocate its legal base from the Republic of Ireland to the United States. This move comes as the company prepares for an IPO for which it submitted plans to the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) back in January.



Circle confirmed the upcoming relocation through a company spokesperson, citing recently filed court documents as evidence of the transition. While the company did not explicitly disclose its motivations, the move is likely intended to facilitate regulatory compliance and adherence, to enhance transparency, especially in anticipation of its purported public listing.



Tax Implications and Shifting Landscape



One key implication of the relocation is the potential impact on Circle’s tax obligations. By establishing its legal headquarters in the US, the company may face a higher tax burden compared to its previous operations in Ireland. 



Ireland’s historically low corporate tax rates were attractive to multinational corporations. However, recent international tax reforms implemented by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) have established a minimum 15% tax on the earnings of the big multinational corporations. This development has eroded some of the traditional tax advantages associated with Ireland.



Founded in 2013, Circle has secured significant backing from both traditional financial institutions and prominent figures within the cryptocurrency domain. Notable investors include Goldman Sachs Group Inc., BlackRock, and Coinbase Global Inc., among others. This broad-based support underscores the increasing convergence of traditional finance with the digital assets realm.









The stablecoin market has seen significant growth in recent years, with USDC emerging as a major platform for transactions and a major liquidity provider in the cryptocurrency ecosystem. Despite facing challenges such as regulatory ambiguity and banking difficulties, USDC’s circulation has rebounded following recent declines, reaching a market capitalization of $33 billion.



In the first quarter of this year, Tether Holdings Ltd., which manages the most sizable stablecoin in terms of market capitalization, reported record profits exceeding $4.5 billion. This highlights the potential profitability of stablecoin operations within the current market environment.

Shiba Inu (SHIB) Witnesses Epic 1,510% Growth of Key Metric, But There's a Catch

In an eye-catching turn of events, the popular meme-inspired cryptocurrency Shiba Inu (SHIB) has experienced an epic surge in a crucial on-chain metric within the span of just 24 hours. According to data sourced by IntoTheBlock, the Large Holders Outflow metric skyrocketed from 60.44 billion SHIB to a jaw-dropping 967.33 billion SHIB, marking an extraordinary 1,510% surge.The Large Holders Outflow metric is instrumental in tracking the movement of funds exiting addresses held by whales or investors, each owning over 0.1% of the cryptocurrency's circulating supply. Such monumental increases in outflows typically raise red flags, hinting at potential panic-induced selling. Source: IntoTheBlockOn the other hand, however, it can mean significant withdrawals from exchanges, which is traditionally a bullish signal.What does it mean for Shiba Inu (SHIB) price?This surge in outflows can be interpreted in multiple ways. On one hand, it may indicate large holders offloading assets amid heightened market volatility to manage positions and dodge liquidations. SHIB to USD by CoinMarketCapConversely, the exodus of funds from exchanges, which often hold substantial amounts of cryptocurrency, suggests a different narrative, possibly indicating a shift in trading strategies or investor sentiment.Despite this monumental surge in the outflow metric, Shiba Inu's price experienced a marginal setback over the same period, witnessing a modest 1.63% decline. However, this dip seems inconsequential, particularly in light of the cryptocurrency's resilience as it swiftly rebounded, surging by an impressive 3% within a day.

                        KuCoin has made the decision to suspend all naira-based peer-to-peer (P2P) trading in response to increased scrutiny from Nigeria’s regulatory authorities.The move comes three weeks after the country’s Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) met with industry players and urged them to cease P2P trading activities.In a Wednesday blog post, KuCoin notified its users of the temporary suspension of P2P naira services and Fast Buy service via Naira card, stating that it is part of their ongoing efforts to enhance their services.The exchange’s decision to halt P2P trading is likely an attempt to avoid running afoul of the Nigerian government, following the recent federal charges faced by another major exchange, Binance.Nigeria Intensifies Scrutiny of P2P Crypto Trading
The Nigerian government, particularly the office of the Security Adviser, has intensified its scrutiny of P2P cryptocurrency trading.Fintechs and banks have been instructed to close bank accounts associated with trading and report such accounts to the authorities.The Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) has also taken action by blocking thousands of accounts involved in crypto trading.Emomotimi Agama, the Director-General of the SEC, blamed crypto P2P traders for the depreciation of the naira during a meeting on May 7, according to a report from TechCabal. He expressed concerns about the impact of P2P crypto trading on the exchange rate of the naira.However, despite these stringent measures, the naira continues to face challenges.On Monday, the naira fell to N1,520 per Dollar at the Foreign Exchange (FOREX) parallel market, a 3.4% decline from the N1,470 per Dollar traded on Friday.Binance Nigeria Conflict Resumes
In a recent blog post, Binance CEO Richard Teng accused a Nigerian government official of pressuring crypto representatives to accept a secret agreement to settle Nigeria’s claims against the exchange.The “settlement” was actually a $150 million bribe from “someone in the Nigerian government.”“Counsel reported back that he had been presented with a demand for a significant payment in cryptocurrency to be paid in secret within 48 hours to make these issues go away and that our decision was expected by the morning,” Teng wrote.“Our team grew increasingly concerned about their safety in Nigeria and immediately departed.”However, Nigeria fired back at Binance‘s bribe accusation, claiming it’s a distraction to shift focus away from the exchange’s actions.Binance recently had to discontinue all services involving Nigerian local fiat currency, the Nigerian naira (NGN), after regulatory scrutiny. Earlier, the Nigerian government imposed a staggering $10 billion fine on Binance as part of a crackdown on the platform in an effort to stabilize the nation’s local currency. Binance has faced increasing regulatory scrutiny worldwide.Last year, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) filed charges against Binance for allegedly operating an illegal digital asset derivatives exchange and evading federal laws.Similarly, the US Securities and Exchange Commission charged Binance Holdings LTD and CZ for allegedly operating unregistered exchanges, broker exchanges, clearing houses, and the unregistered offer and sale of securities.

Copy Trading Gets Decentralized: What are the Best Tools to Follow Top Traders | Cryptopolitan

Copy trading spreads across decentralized exchanges (DEX), trying to make the best of a highly dynamic market. The speed of trades also makes it necessary to use trading bots, so strategies can be automated. Following the best traders was one of the main perks of platforms like eToro during previous crypto bull markets. Top traders specifically described their strategies and had great influence. In crypto, copy trading is more informal and has been automated by third parties. How Copy Trading is Made Easier on the BlockchainAdditionally, since crypto wallets are transparent, addresses are on a watch list to track trading decisions. Traders can easily tap into public wallets or trading personalities, especially those with Ethereum DNS handles, to gather strategies for both existing pairs or newly launched tokens. Additionally, users can view or aggregate the notable activities of existing exchange bots through a blockchain explorer. The blockchain activities with lots of data also enable DEX and other services to offer easy-to-use copy trading products. Which are the Best Decentralized Copy Trading Bots?Decentralized bots must pick the optimal amount of data while connecting multiple exchanges and wallets. One tool took more than a year to go public. The GoodCrypto bot aggregates most major markets and offers copy-trading, along with signal-based trading. The Good Crypto has been renewed during the current bull market cycle, offering a new app-based approach. Tracking Whales and Finding Gem Coins Becomes Go-to DEX StrategyThe mix of public whale wallets and a growing list of new assets means users can build their own copy-trading portfolio. This approach is only partially automated, and will still require personal research. The Dexscreener tool will give a long list of tokens, where those with good volumes and high locked liquidity are the best candidates. Once a token is discovered, DeBank is the tool to analyze the whale holders of that token. If the whale wallet shows a good track record, its strategies can be copied through the Prodigy Sniping Bot. The best approach is to only use high-profile bots, and avoid connecting a main wallet if there are doubts about the bot’s origin. DEX Trading Draws In 100X SeekersDEX copy-trading has a riskier profile, mostly because its main target is potential 100X tokens. This allows projects to build their products entirely on-chain while automatically singling out the gems. The on-chain approach is even more powerful compared to signal-based trading apps. Logearn is one of the tools for 100X tokens, along with alerts when a good match is found. The Logearn service also works to single out active trader wallets with a good track record. Those addresses can be used with other sniping bots. Smart Money Vs Mass Sniping Walletscopy-trading tools can have different strategies. For traders on the Solana blockchain, the trend of meme tokens meant some traders did not even bother with pre-selection. Instead, they used automation to snipe all newly minted tokens with small purchases. Mass sniping is the opposite of doing some preliminary research, or of following the “smart money”. A whale wallet with thousands of tokens may make one good trade to offset the losses, but copying mass sniping holds additional risk. Solana DEX also offer more possibilities for sniping, due to lower fees and more agile asset creation. AI Assistance Boosts Copy TradesAnalyzing data for thousands of tokens is a task best left to AI. For Solana DEX traders, AI tools also simplify the search for the best-performing whales. TradeWiz is among the preferred tools for Solana-based sniping. The smart money feature means traders can concentrate on copying some of the best wallets for a given period. Crypto DEX trading is extremely dynamic, and even for the most successful wallets, past performance does not guarantee future earnings. On-chain tools for copy trading don’t rely on social media influencers and their token preferences. While some traders make accurate calls on social media, there is also overwhelming hype. Using data, copy trading tools, and sniping bots helps avoid over-investing in unpredictable tokens.

ARK 21Shares Amends Spot ETH ETF Filing: Cathie Wood On Ethereum ETF Approvals - Benzinga

In January, ARK Invest teamed up with 21Shares to offer a spot bitcoin ETF, which trades as ARKB. The ETF has been hugely successful, attracting several billion dollars in investment. However, the duo is not content with just a spot in a bitcoin ETF. They have also applied for a spot in ethereum ETF, which is currently under review by the SEC.Don't Miss:Though they did not make a formal comment, ARK and 21Shares updated their filing for the spot ethereum ETF application. The update removed a small clause related to staking. Originally, the firms were looking to stake ETH that was held by the firms, which would have been labeled as income from the fund. "Sponsor may, from time to time, stake a portion of the Trust's assets through one or more trusted Staking Providers," the clause noted.However, the update excluded this clause. While they did keep all of the other clauses specific to ethereum, the change caused some to raise eyebrows. Eric Balchunas is an ETF analyst for Bloomberg and in a post on X, he said, "While it may seem like this is them getting their docs in shape based on SEC comments (which would be good news) there hasn't been any comments. So it’s prob either a Hail Mary or maybe trying to give SEC one less thing to use in their rejection. Not sure (yet)." According to Balchunas, the SEC did not prompt ARK and 21Shares to make the change. So, in his opinion, it is some sort of preemptive action to give their application a higher probability of acceptance. Trending: 1 in 4 Americans own a share of Bitcoin according to NASDAQ, how much would $10 get you today?The issue of staking has been seen by some as a hang-up for potential approval of spot ethereum ETFs. The novelty of the system could cause further delays in the already lengthy decision-making process by the SEC. So, by leaving it out of the application, ARK could improve its chances of approval. However, this does come at the cost of having a less attractive ETF, as the staking rewards would not be earned.The SEC has already made delays to decisions on multiple applications. As it stands, the final date for a decision on the VanEck ETH ETF application is May 23, followed by ARK 21Shares' on May 24th. "Our odds of approval remain the same: slim to none," Balchunas said in a post on X. Cathie Wood is the CEO of ARK Invest and is known to be extremely bullish on cryptocurrency. However, even she acknowledged that the crypto ETF market may not see much more growth. "We'd be surprised to see anything but bitcoin and ether being approved by the [U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission]," she said in an interview. The case for a spot ethereum ETF is getting weaker, and the SEC has not spoken often on the topic. While there is certainly a possibility that the ETFs could receive approval in late 2024 or 2025, it seems unlikely that they will occur anytime soon.Read Next:

Giant Investment Management Company Vanguard Appointed a Bitcoin-Friendly Name as CEO! Have ETFs been Green Lighted? - Bitcoin Sistemi

Vanguard, one of the world's largest investment management firms, made an important move by appointing former BlackRock executive Salim Ramji as its new CEO and board member, effective July 8.
Vanguard Appoints Bitcoin-Friendly Former BlackRock Executive as CEO
This decision signals a potential shift in the company's attitude towards Bitcoin and digital assets.


Ramji brings 25 years of industry experience to his new role, notably leading BlackRock's global exchange-traded fund (ETF) business and overseeing the launch of the IBIT spot Bitcoin ETF in the US, but left BlackRock earlier this year in search of new leadership opportunities.
Expressing his excitement for his new role, Ramji said, “It is an honor to join Vanguard, an institution I have long admired and respected.”





Ramji emphasized Vanguard's commitment to its mission of delivering investment success and expressed his readiness to lead the company into the future.

Ramji's appointment comes as Vanguard's current Chairman and CEO, Tim Buckley, prepares for retirement.


In his statement, Buckley praised Ramji's commitment to investors and strategic thinking, emphasizing his alignment with Vanguard's core values.
This move is particularly notable given Vanguard's historical stance on Bitcoin.





The firm had previously refrained from offering US spot Bitcoin ETFs to brokerage account users, citing high volatility concerns. But Ramji's appointment raises speculation about a potential shift in Vanguard's approach to digital assets.

A new Open-Source system for Worldcoin biometric data

Worldcoin Foundation has recently made a significant announcement: the migration to a new open-source system designed to improve the protection of users’ biometric data, especially iris codes. 
This change is welcomed with interest and some skepticism, as the protection of personal data is a matter of increasing importance in today’s digital world.

A new Open-Source system for Worldcoin’s biometric data
The new system introduced by Worldcoin has been designed to be open-source, a feature that allows anyone to examine its code and contribute to its improvement.
This approach to transparency is intended to reassure users about the security and integrity of the system itself. Security experts and independent technologists can review the code, identify potential vulnerabilities, and suggest improvements, creating an environment of mutual trust between the organization and its users.
One of the most delicate aspects in data management today is the protection of biometric information. Biometric data, such as fingerprints and iris codes, are unique to each individual and, if compromised, can have serious consequences for privacy and personal security. 
The decision of Worldcoin to migrate to a new system was accompanied by the deletion of previously collected iris codes, a step that demonstrates a commitment to greater privacy protection.
Worldcoin has stated that the new system not only eliminates previous biometric data, but also introduces more secure and advanced methods for managing sensitive information. 
This includes the use of stronger encryption algorithms and enhanced security protocols that make it extremely difficult for any malicious actors to access users’ biometric data.
Deletion of iris codes
One of the highlights of the Worldcoin announcement was the statement that they have eliminated the iris codes generated during the user registration process. This step is significant because it demonstrates an active stance in protecting user data, as well as being a strategic move to gain the trust of the public.
The deletion of iris codes was made possible thanks to the migration to the new system, which offers advanced functionalities for secure management of biometric data. This deletion has raised some questions among industry experts, as the management of biometric data always requires great attention to detail and security.
On one hand, many cybersecurity experts and privacy advocates have praised the organization for its commitment to protecting personal data. The transparency of the open-source system is seen as a positive signal that could inspire other companies to follow Worldcoin’s example.
On the other hand, some critics remain skeptical about the real security of the new system and Worldcoin’s ability to effectively protect users’ biometric data in the long term. The technology sector is constantly evolving, and new threats are constantly emerging, making data protection an ongoing challenge.
Conclusions
The decision of Worldcoin to migrate to an open-source system to improve the protection of biometric data represents a significant step in the right direction. By eliminating users’ iris codes, the organization demonstrates a concrete commitment to privacy and security. 
However, the true test of the success of this new system will lie in its ability to withstand future threats and maintain the trust of users.
In a world where personal data is increasingly valuable and vulnerable, Worldcoin’s actions could set a new standard for protecting sensitive information. Only time will tell if this transparent and security-oriented approach will be adopted by other organizations and if it will be able to keep the promises made to its users. 
For now, the technology sector is watching closely, hoping that this initiative could mark the beginning of a new era in the protection of biometric data.

Bitcoin Price Shoots Up to 10-Day Peak as $1 Billion in BTC Leaves Coinbase


																Bitcoin’s price went on a roll in the past few hours after the US CPI announcement and following a massive BTC outflow from Coinbase.
Although the recipient of those 16,021 BTC is still unknown, CryptoQuant’s analysts suggest it was an institutional player.
The report from today indicates that 16,021 BTC were withdrawn from Coinbase in the early hours of May 15. Given bitcoin’s current price tag, this amount is worth just over $1 billion.
The analyst said this is the seventh similar outflow from Coinbase in 2024. Moreover, they indicated that such outflows have intensified since February 19, roughly a month after the US SEC greenlighted nearly a dozen spot Bitcoin ETFs. Coinbase serves as the custodian for most ETFs.
Although CryptoQuant’s analyst said this transfer could be an internal movement of Coinbase funds, they suggested that it was not:




“There is a high probability that this transaction is an institutional purchase.”
The withdrawal came just a few hours before the US Consumer Price Index (CPI) numbers came out, which were exactly as anticipated at 3.4%.
BTC’s price reacted with an immediate rally after the announcement of the April inflation rate and jumped to $64,000. However, it kept pumping in the following hour or so and tapped a multi-day peak of just over $64,500 before retracing by around $500.
Numerous analysts and experts speculated in the past few days that the cryptocurrency will see its next bull rally only when the US Federal Reserve finally decides to cut the interest rates. Such a scenario is possible only if the inflation percentages decline to under 3% and down to around 2%.

Crypto Old-Head Otoh Talks Casascius Bitcoins, Tax Havens and Old Friends

I think it is excellent as an investment. I think that's its main use at the moment. It’s perhaps the best performing investment in history, and it continues to grow. It is a trillion dollar asset class, and a great way to store value. Satoshi viewed it in the beginning as a hedge against the degenerate behavior of central governments and banks abusing the currencies that we will have to use every day. It's much more versatile than gold, in that it can be transferred pretty much anywhere around the world from anyone to anyone, instantly, with no armored trucks or anything and next to no fees. It's quite miraculous really, that it's come into existence. It's still very early days, but it really has transformed the world in many many ways.

Algotech gains as Bitcoin spikes towards $64k on latest CPI report - CoinJournal



                    

                    
Bitcoin price rose to near $64,000 as stock futures climbed.
The upside came after US inflation data showed consumer prices rose less than expected in April.
Algotech, a new crypto trading project, continued to attract investors as its presale crossed $4.8 million.

As stock futures rose on Wednesday, Bitcoin price jumped more than 2% to break above $63,700. The benchmark cryptocurrency’s rise towards $64,000 saw altcoins flip green.
Amid the gains for alts such as Ethereum, Toncoin and Avalanche, new crypto project Algotech swelled in presale.
Bitcoin surges as CPI rises less than expected
On Wednesday, data on inflation showed that the consumer price index (CPI), the US Federal Reserve’s preferred inflation gauge, only rose 0.3% in April. That was lower than the expectation of 0.4% for the month-on-month increase, CNBC reported.
While the inflation reading remains above 3%, its overall dip to 3.36% year-over-year in April from the 3.48% reported in March attracted a reaction across markets. Also notable was the US Core CPI (which excludes food and energy) – it was 3.62% YoY in April compared to 3.80% the previous month.
The inflation report saw Treasury yields fell as stocks pumped. The gains were also visible across the crypto market, with Bitcoin jumping from below $62,000 to hit highs above $63,855.
A 3.6% upside for BTC pushed the total crypto market cap up by more than 2% to over $2.43 trillion.
Algotech: A new crypto trading project
At its core, Algotech is a decentralized algorithmic trading platform that brings innovative crypto trading technologies to the ordinary trader.
The goal is to empower traders via integration of artificial intelligence, machine learning and analytics tools. Automation and blockchain technology meet to offer a potentially game-changing platform for crypto traders.
As it prepares to launch, Algotech has allocated 70% of the total of 350,000,000 ALGT to the public presale. When the current presale stage concludes, the ALGT price will increase to $0.10. Meanwhile, the estimated launch price after the presale is $0.15.
Algotech gains as presale nears $5 million raise
Algotech has raised more than $4.88 million in its ongoing token sale, with the current presale stage more than 75% sold out.
Currently, only 14% of ALGT tokens remain unsold in stage 3. It means investors keen to grab some of the tokens at prices of $0.08 may want to take swift action. But why is the interest in Algotech rising?
While today’s Bitcoin price spike towards $64k has buoyed the broader crypto market, the overall interest in Algotech is something that has built up in bounds these past few weeks.
The positive sentiment around the project has strengthened as more people understand what the platform offers. Moreso, it’s the potential for its defining features to drive the next big wave in crypto trading that has investors flocking to the presale.
Visit the Algotech website to learn more about this project.

Bitcoin, Ethereum underperform as crypto market remains bearish - AMBCrypto



Bearish sentiment dominated the crypto market.
BTC and ETH led the bearish sentiment with their poor price trends.

While holders of certain meme coins may be celebrating significant gains in recent days, the broader cryptocurrency market appears subdued. 
Recent data indicated an overall negative sentiment prevailing in the market, potentially paving the way for an uptrend in the near future. 
However, as of now, the market capitalization is on the decline, with major assets experiencing decreases in value over the past 24 hours.
Negative sentiments dominate crypto market
AMBCrypto’s analysis of the crypto market’s Weighted Sentiment, focusing on large-cap assets such as Bitcoin [BTC], Ethereum [ETH], and Binance BNB, revealed a prevailing negative sentiment at press time.
 The Santiment chart illustrated a bearish sentiment across the market from the 8th to the 14th of May.
 Similar patterns of universal bearishness were observed from the 10th to the 16th of April, as well as the 13th to the 19th of March. 
At press time, Ripple exhibited the lowest Weighted Sentiment, with Bitcoin following closely as the second lowest.

Crypto market capitalization declines
AMBCrypto’s examination of the crypto market data on CoinMarketCap revealed a decline in market capitalization over the last 24 hours. 
The market cap had decreased by over 1.3% to approximately $2.27 trillion at the time of this writing. Despite this decline, the volume has surged, showing an increase of over 27% to around $68 billion. 
Furthermore, the fear and greed index reflected a neutral sentiment, standing at 55 at press time. However, it appeared to be edging closer to fear. 
This drop in market capitalization is attributed to the lackluster performance of major assets like Bitcoin and Ethereum in recent hours.
Bitcoin and Ethereum remain bearish despite increases
AMBCrypto’s analysis of the Bitcoin price trend on a daily timeframe revealed a setback in its attempted rebound. 
The decline was marked by an over 2% decline on the 14th of May, bringing its price back to the $61,000 zone. 
However, at the time of this writing, Bitcoin had recovered with an over 2% increase, trading above $62,000 once again.

Similarly, Ethereum experienced a decline of over 2% in the previous trading session, settling around $2,800. Nevertheless, it had rebounded by over 1% at the time of writing, trading at approximately $2,900.
 Despite these fluctuations, both assets remained in a bearish trend, contributing to the overall bearish sentiment in the crypto market.

Anchorage Digital, an institutional crypto platform, has announced support for native DYDX staking, according to the information shared with Finbold on May 14. 
The development allows institutions to stake DYDX directly from their secure custody at Anchorage Digital and earn staking rewards distributed by the protocol in USD Coin (USDC).
Anchorage Digital crypto services
Home of the only federally chartered digital asset bank, Anchorage Digital offers a range of crypto services, including custody and staking. 


Moreover, serving as the preferred partner for crypto innovators, Anchorage Digital has been supporting ethDYDX custody since its mainnet launch in 2021 and native DYDX custody since the dYdX Chain’s launch in Q4 of the same year. 
With the staking support expansion, Anchorage Digital takes a significant step forward in facilitating safe and secure institutional involvement in the dYdX ecosystem.
Nathan McCauley, CEO and Co-Founder of Anchorage Digital, remarked:

“For many institutions, custody is just the start. Increasingly, institutions want to engage in staking, earn rewards, and contribute to the long-term scaling of innovative networks like dYdX. By adding staking support for its native token, DYDX, Anchorage Digital is proud to help unlock a new era of institutional participation in the dYdX ecosystem.”

Staking DYDX on Anchorage Digital
Anchorage Digital supports hundreds of top assets selected based on institutional demand and stringent quality and safety standards. 
Clients can now easily stake DYDX to earn rewards, with both the underlying assets (DYDX tokens) and staking rewards (USDC tokens) securely held in custody on the Anchorage Digital platform.
Charles d’Haussy, CEO of dYdX Foundation, stated:

“Anchorage Digital’s integration of native DYDX staking initiates a new era of institutional engagement with dYdX. Staking involves more than just the accumulation of USDC rewards; it is a proactive effort to enhance the growth and sustainability of the dYdX ecosystem. This collaboration provides best in class custody solutions and boosts the attractiveness of the protocol.”

Driving Decentralization on the dYdX Chain
The dYdX Chain stands out as the leading decentralized finance (DeFi) protocol focusing on perpetual futures, entirely decentralized and community-governed. 
It distributes 100% of protocol fees to DYDX stakers to fortify the security of the dYdX Chain. 
Since its launch, the dYdX Chain has generated over $136 billion in cumulative trading volume and distributed over $23 million in USDC as staking rewards to nearly 20,000 stakers, according to Mintscan. 
Anchorage Digital’s integration of staking support for native DYDX enhances institutional interest by providing secure and regulated custodial services. 
This partnership offers a compliant staking solution for DYDX token holders and fosters institutional adoption, contributing to the ecosystem’s growth.

Crypto boom: 1 million new tokens launched in just 30 days


The cryptocurrency market has seen the creation of over one million new tokens in just 30 days. This explosive growth highlights the rapid development and increasing interest in digital assets.
Ethereum (ETH) has seen 372,642 new tokens since April 1st, with 88% on Coinbase’s layer-2 blockchain, Base. Meanwhile, Solana (SOL) has witnessed a significant influx of new tokens, driven by the popularity of memecoins. This unprecedented activity underscores the dynamic evolution of the crypto landscape.
Conor Grogan, Coinbase Director, highlighted in an X (formerly Twitter) post that this number is double the number of tokens created on Ethereum between 2015 and 2023. 


The Total Value Locked (TVL) on Base has surged  by around 630% since early 2024, driven primarily by the memecoin mania.

Meanwhile, Solana has witnessed the creation of 643,227 new tokens within the same period, with a staggering 466,914 being memecoins. This translates to over 20,000 new Solana tokens being created every day.

According to data from Step Finance and a Dune Analytics dashboard tracking Solana-based memecoins on pump.fun, the popularity of memecoins on Solana is evident.
As per the report by CoinGecko , over 0.54 million new crypto tokens have been created in 2024 as of early April, averaging 5,300 new tokens launched daily this year.
Number of tokens created quarterly on DEXs. Source:  coingecko.com/research
Given that this is already more than half of the 0.83 million new tokens launched last year, 2024 is on track to surpass 2023 in the number of new tokens onchain.
It remains to be seen whether the absolute number of new tokens launched will continue to increase gradually or exponentially year-over-year, especially as the crypto industry seeks to bring more real-world assets onchain.
With platforms like Pump.fun making it easier to launch tokens and onchain trading becoming more affordable, future memecoin seasons may lead to even greater spikes in new tokens.
Industry reactions and concerns
The crypto community has had mixed reactions to this boom. On the one hand, memecoins have become a trend, capturing significant market attention.
On the other hand, critics argue that the proliferation of memecoins leads to increased scams and rug pulls.
They believe that the diversion of funds to these speculative tokens hampers investments in more legitimate projects.
Additionally, the rise of sniper bots, which quickly acquire new memecoins hoping for rapid profits, has been a concern, contributing to the perception of memecoins as a volatile market segment.
Despite these concerns, the creation of nearly one million new tokens in just a month is a significant milestone. While the popularity of memecoins drives significant activity, it also raises important questions about the sustainability and security of these new digital assets. 
As the market continues to evolve, stakeholders will need to navigate these complexities to ensure the long-term success of the cryptocurrency ecosystem.

Shiba Inu (SHIB) is in the spotlight today as its metrics contrast as they hint at a possible rebound. At the time of writing, the dog-themed meme coin is displaying a mild surge with a 0.67% boost to $0.00002373.Bollinger Bands hint at bullish Shiba Inu uptrendThis mild uptick is not Shiba Inu’s first rodeo or attempt to form support at the $0.000023 price mark. Broader market forces have always worked to suppress the ultimate breakout potential of Shiba Inu; however, insights from Bollinger Bands' technical indicator show there might be a reboot coming soon.SHIB/USDT 1D Char via TradingViewThe SHIB/USDT one-day chart on TradingView shows that Shiba Inu has been trading from the oversold point since at least May 7. With the price trending around the lower Bollinger Bands to date, the possibility of a trend reversal is high.The mild break as the price shifts toward neutral-middle Bollinger Bands hints at promise, but it might be short-lived. Shiba Inu’s community, however, remains resolved about the longer-term end goals. With large transactions spotted in recent times, it becomes evidently possible for the brooding breakout to be recorded in the long term.Shiba Inu’s neutral Relative Strength Index (RSI) also visibly underscores the fair chance for SHIB bulls to regain control of the market.All-time high (ATH) catalyst pushShiba Inu attained an all-time high of $0.00008845 in October 2021 on pure hype. Today, the digital currency has reached an immense evolution that has transitioned it from a speculative hype meme coin to a protocol with growing use cases.The potential of Shibarium, its smart contracts platform, and its general market uptrend have what it takes to complement SHIB's technical signals. In the near future, Shiba Inu might make an attempt to retest the ATH and potentially chart a new price milestone overall.

Macro Guru Raoul Pal Predicts 'Banana Zone' For Crypto: 'Don't Midcurve It' - Benzinga

Macro guru Raoul Pal sheds light on the "Banana Zone," a concept tied to his "Everything Code" framework, which aims to explain the cyclical nature of global liquidity and its impact on asset prices, particularly in the tech and crypto sectors.What Happened: Pal points out that the global liquidity cycle, which has exhibited clear cyclicality since 2008, drives the macro summer and fall seasons. He attributes this perfect macrocycle to the world’s reset of interest payments to zero and debt maturity to 3-4 years in 2008.Pal's "Everything Code"The Everything Code suggests that the business cycle repeats as liquidity rises to debase currency and service debt rollovers, preventing a potentially catastrophic debt spiral. This debasement lowers the denominator (fiat currency), causing asset prices to rise optically.Growth assets, such as tech and crypto, perform best during these periods due to their secular trends based on adoption. Pal compares the adoption rate of crypto to that of the internet, suggesting that the crypto market cap could grow from $2.5 trillion to $100 trillion over time.Also Read: Arthur Hayes: ‘Major Economies To Print Even More Money’ In The Next 24 MonthsCrypto's "Banana Zone"Pal notes that while tech experiences its mini-Banana Zone during macro summer and fall, the effect is more pronounced in crypto due to its outperformance relative to tech.The transition to macro summer is relatively forecastable, thanks to the repeating cycle outlined in the Everything Code, and its ushers in liquidity growth, which tends to create the Banana Zone.While Pal acknowledges that the odds of significant changes to this pattern are low, he cautions that nothing plays out perfectly, and the structure or nature of the final leg of the fall remains uncertain. He advises investors to expect surprises along the way, such as sharp corrections or long sideways markets.Everything Code x Banana ZoneDespite these uncertainties, Pal believes that the Everything Code provides the best framework for understanding the market dynamics at play. He suggests that with the right time horizon, portfolio management, and patience, investors can navigate the Banana Zone and beyond with a low probability of messing it up.The Macro Guru suggests traders take partial profits in the current cycle and reminds his followers not to "mid-curve it," as "numbers go up over time."What’s Next: The influence of Bitcoin as an institutional asset class is expected to be thoroughly explored at Benzinga’s upcoming Future of Digital Assets event on Nov. 19.

Bitcoin network activity at 5-year low while BTC price is 10x higher


The Bitcoin (BTC) network activity has dropped to lows previously seen in February 2019, five years ago. At that time, BTC was trading at $6,380 – ten times lower than its current price of $63,800.
Finbold retrieved premium data from Santiment on May 15, which shows a 5-year low count for Bitcoin’s 30-day active addresses. Essentially, this metric looks at the number of distinct addresses participating in a transaction in the last 30 days. Each address is counted only once for the window and represents the overall network activity in a given period.
Notably, the Bitcoin network registered 12.64 million active addresses in this window, a count previously seen in February 2019. BTC was trading at the $6,380 price level with massive volatility in the final phases of a bear market.


Interestingly, July 2021 had a similar network activity drop to 14.50 million right after last cycle’s first top at nearly $65,000—happening at the same time as a 50% price crash hit BTC, driving the asset to below $30,000.

Why does Bitcoin network activity matter?
There are a few possible insights to get from Bitcoin’s network activity, not necessarily related to price action. Nevertheless, the above chart suggests a direct correlation between the 30-day count of active addresses and the BTC price.
Overall, higher network activity indicates a higher demand from unique peers to use Bitcoin for value transfer. Satoshi Nakamoto described Bitcoin as a “peer-to-peer electronic cash system.” Thus, higher demand for that use could suggest the tool is delivering its promise and attracting new users for that.
Conversely, a lower network activity at surging prices could raise doubts about where Bitcoin’s market demand is coming from. Moreover, it could put this demand’s health in check if it comes mostly from derivatives speculation rather than organic use.
BTC price analysis
From another perspective, lower network activity means fewer addresses have withdrawn and deposited from and to crypto exchanges. Usually, increased withdrawals mean Bitcoin investors are buying, while increased deposits mean higher selling activity—both of which affect price.
As of this writing, BTC is testing a key resistance on its 30-day exponential moving average (30-EMA). Bitcoin has been trading below this technical indicator resistance since April while also testing the $60,000 psychological support.

A breakout from any of these prices could set BTC’s next trajectory. Analysts believe Bitcoin has already left a “danger zone” and could be ready for a bounce. However, should the network activity correlation remain, Bitcoin could face a significant drop before visiting higher grounds.
The leading cryptocurrency has kept a price range between $60,000 and $72,000 since February 2024, with two deviations. As cryptocurrencies continue to be a high-volatility market, investors and traders must be cautious while making sensitive financial decisions.

XRP Might Be on Verge of Epic Breakout if This Pattern Validates

XRP, the seventh-largest cryptocurrency, may be approaching a critical price juncture with an intriguing pattern suggesting that a significant price shift could be on the horizon.Technical analysts closely monitor chart patterns to identify potential trends in asset prices. One such pattern that has emerged on XRP's price chart is the triangle pattern, characterized by converging trendlines that create a triangle shape. In the context of XRP's chart, this pattern suggests a period of consolidation and indecision among traders, with the potential for a decisive breakout shortly. The tightening consolidation on the XRP price chart suggests a tussle between buyers and sellers, with neither gaining a definitive upper hand — until now.Several factors could serve as catalysts for XRP's potential breakout from the triangle pattern, including fundamental developments and investor optimism.Additionally, broader market trends and macroeconomic factors may also influence XRP's price trajectory, with favorable conditions potentially fueling a breakout to the upside.A bullish breakout might mark the start of a new upswing for XRP, perhaps resulting in significant gains. However, a failed breakout or a bearish reversal could result in losses for those caught on the wrong side of the trade.Should XRP break out from the symmetrical triangle, an initial surge toward $1 to $2.5 might be expected, with a more ambitious long-term target of $20. In the very immediate term, the $0.46 price level has been identified as a significant support zone. At the time of writing, XRP was down 1.39% in the last 24 hours to $0.50.As XRP teeters on the verge of a potential breakout from the triangle pattern, anticipation is building among market participants eager to capitalize on the next major price move; however, the outcome remains uncertain.

Swarm (SMT) to Reach 10M Investors After Listing on Uphold Platform | Cryptopolitan

Swarm, a platform for real-world asset tokenization, will list its SMT token through Uphold’s market. Trading will start on May 16. Swarm Market launched its asset tokenization tools in 2019 and is now returning for the renewed RWA tokenization trend. Swarm Market aims to offer a mix of decentralized trading and tokens based on real-world value. The partnership comes at a time when regulators are tightening rules on crypto trading, token issuance, and ownership. The Swarm-Uphold partnership service offers regulated opportunities and various forms of custody.The Uphold listing happened just days after the project’s treasury distributed additional SMT tokens to users. Swarm Market aims to boost SMT, while also offering exposure to real-world stocks and businesses. Interest in RWA rose in 2024, getting a boost even from the gold market. Swarm offers diversification, tapping into multiple asset classes, and manages to appeal both to crypto natives and to mainstream investors. Swarm Market Brings Earnings from NVidia, BlackRock and MoreTokenized assets means anyone with a wallet can gain exposure to the shares of global companies, without the need of a stock broker. On Swarm, tokens can represent companies like BlackRock, Coinbase, or NVidia, tapping some of the latest trends on the stock market.Swarm Market is powered by Polygon, a L2 blockchain that has proven its scalability. Pricing information to redeem tokens is supplied through Chainlink oracles. The underlying assets are also verified and held by institutional- grade partners, before the final tokenization puts the user in control of the assets. The RWA on Swarm Market are fully asset-backed, and are not just empty tokens to bet on the price of an asset. This sets out Swarm as a more regulated and secure project, especially in a market where most tokens have no forms of backing. At the same time, all tokens are held in the user’s wallet with full self-custody.SMT Tokens Aim for Price RecoverySMT tokens traded at $0.54 after the news of the partnership. SMT peaked in early April, trading above $1.17, an all-time high value. SMT is a relatively late arrival, launching trading just at the tail end of the 2021 bull market. The token drifted for years before reaching a new peak and trading records in 2024. SMT is yet to gain exposure, as it is still outside even the top 500 tokens by market capitalization. But the Swarm Market experience with regulated trading is making the project stand out and gain the valuable partnership, despite the low token price. SMT token trading is also relatively slow, turning over 0.63 of the supply. The Uphold listing aims to compensate the fact that SMT still relies on small exchanges and an Uniswap decentralized pair. The fact that SMT is a Polygon-based token means the asset is relegated to less liquid trading. SMT is considered a growth asset with a risky future but significant potential upside. The token is still held in just 6,692 wallets on the Polygon blockchain, awaiting much wider distribution after the Uphold listing. Uphold Offers Vaults for Secure StorageWhile Swarm Market relies on self-custody, Uphold takes the opposite approach. The platform has built a transparent vault to store users’ crypto assets, recently adding a Bitcoin vault. Uphold is a part of the infrastructure that connects traditional finance and blockchain assets. Custodians are key for some forms of regulated trading, offering tools for mainstream investors to get exposed to crypto assets without the need to secure their own wallet. Uphold also actively selects and lists digital coins and tokens, while linking to 28 other trading venues, including decentralized exchanges. Uphold also carries L2 assets and rollups. The end goal is to offer custody and crypto trading that is fully transparent and compliant with US financial regulations.

Solana (SOL) Based DEX Developer Admits to Gambling with User Funds! - Bitcoin Sistemi


As the popularity of cryptocurrencies continues to grow, incidents of hacking and fraud are also on the rise.
However, this time a different situation occurred. Hoak, a developer at Cypher, a decentralized exchange based on Solana (SOL), admitted to stealing approximately $315,000 in user funds and gambling them away.


The pseudonymous developer known as Hoak admitted to stealing hundreds of thousands of dollars worth of cryptocurrency from Cypher's hack refund fund.
In his statement, Hoak admitted that he took the money, gambled and lost it.







Hoak's admission comes a day after he shared that another of Cypher's developers, Barrett, had systematically withdrawn cryptocurrency from the protocol's hack payback fund over several months, starting in December.


Citing on-chain data, Barrett said Hoak sent approximately $300,000 worth of cryptocurrency to Binance.
As you may remember, Cypher suffered a hack attack in August 2023 and lost over $1 million in cryptocurrencies (SOL and USDC).

Small creditors put at risk by latest FTX bankruptcy development

A significant claim against FTX EU — previously known as K-DNA Financial Services —has been transferred to FTXcreditor in the latest development in the FTX bankruptcy case. The transfer has the potential to accelerate all further proceedings but also presents risks to smaller creditors.According to the documents filed in the U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the District of Delaware on May 15, the claim is part of the ongoing Chapter 11 proceedings previously held against FTX EU. The transfer was conducted under the rules required by the Federal Rules of Bankruptcy Procedure, particularly Rule 3001(e)(2), which deals with claims transfers:"Seller hereby waives any notice or hearing requirements imposed by Rule 3001 of the Federal Rules of Bankruptcy Procedure, and stipulates that an order may be entered recognizing this Evidence of Transfer of Claim as an unconditional assignment and Buyer as the valid owner of the claim.”The move is a strategic attempt to simplify the administrative processes of the bankruptcy case by consolidating all claims under a single creditor. Though this has the potential to expedite the case toward a conclusion, it does present a risk to smaller creditors. Due to the single-point of entry to claims through the company, smaller creditors could be overshadowed in favor of larger creditors — receiving less or less favorable terms.The new single claim holder, FTXcreditor, is represented by Michael Bottjer; however, the transferor’s identity remains confidential at this time.“To protect the identity of the Transferor, Transferee has not disclosed the Transferor’s name or address, and has not attached the signed Evidence of Transfer to this Notice of Transfer of Claim.”The lack of transparency could raise questions about the handling of the bankruptcy process amid this consolidatory process — exposing risks for manipulation where claim transfer identities remain shrouded behind anonymity.Related: Post-FTX crypto industry needs education before regulation: Former Biden advisor After filing for bankruptcy in November 2022, the cryptocurrency exchange FTX faced sudden financial downturns, which have had lasting consequences for all affected creditors. Since then, regulations — particularly in the U.S. — have honed in on cryptocurrencies in an attempt to assert more controls and ensure investor safety. This latest development in the case follows a recent development from FTX co-founder Sam Bankman-Fried, who maintained his innocence after his 25-year jail sentence. In an interview on May 9, Bankman-Fried described his experience, explaining that he had been living on beans and rice — the latter becoming what he called “one of the currencies of the realm inside.”Related: Circle shifts legal home to US ahead of IPO

FLOKI Follows PEPE, Gains 18% on Binance Listing in Thailand - DailyCoin


        
Binance Thailand lists FLOKI, igniting a double-digit bull breakout.



Thailand made it to the Top 10 list through national crypto adoption.



Analysts find key similarities in FLOKI & PEPE’s performance.
The Viking-themed meme coin Floki (FLOKI) expands its audience to Thailand. The crypto-friendly country bolsters clear regulation and a 12% adoption rate, according to the 2023 Global Cryptocurrency Adoption Index, calculated by Chainalysis.
The move by Binance’s subsidiary in Thailand opens the door for FLOKI crypto to a 69 million audience, 10 million of whom already employ blockchain for their everyday deeds. Binance Thailand is regulated by the Ministry of Finance and supervised by Thailand’s Office of Securities and Exchange Commission.As Thai people are known to use cryptocurrency payments for everyday transactions, FLOKI crypto joins a list of popular altcoins like Solana (SOL), Ripple (XRP), and Ether (ETH) to trade against the Thai Baht (THB). Following the news, FLOKI picked up 13.3% daily gains, proceeding the weekly bull run to an 18% 7-day profit.FLOKI Following PEPE’s Path to Glory?Among Floki’s crypto meme coin’s meme coin peers, PEPE recently stood out as the biggest gainer, claiming $4.8 billion in market capitalization. While Floki’s historical price movements correlate highly with Pepe, Floki’s global market cap is over two times smaller, currently at $1,955,788,722.Many crypto analysts believe a lower market cap gives FLOKI more room to grow. For instance, crypto trader Rise To The Moon forecasts a $20 billion market cap for FLOKI sometime in the next bull run. In such a case, FLOKI crypto could throw the gauntlet to Dogecoin (DOGE) for the top dog’s status.As of press time, FLOKI is exchanging hands at $0.0002172, according to CoinGecko. Knocking on the doors of crypto’s TOP 50 by global market cap, Floki is now 39% up monthly, while the yearly return skyrocketed to 508.2%. Meanwhile, PEPE soared by 545.8% during the same time frame.On the Flipside
One key difference between the competing meme coins, FLOKI and PEPE, is the market depth and on-chain liquidity.



According to the combined liquidity books, Pepe’s daily trading volume was five times larger than Floki’s, encompassing $2.7B and $574M, respectively.

Roaring Kitty crypto, AMC rally amid GameStop buzz: 'Sell, sell, sell' - AMBCrypto



Roaring Kitty crypto and AMC surged amid the market downturn.
Former SEC Chair Jay Clayton questions ethics of market manipulation via social media.

On the 14th of May, while Bitcoin [BTC] and other leading cryptocurrencies were bleeding, shares of GameStop [GME] and AMC Entertainment Holdings [AMC] were surging.
Reportedly, GME and AMC skyrocketed by 75% and 89%, respectively. 
This dramatic shift also triggered a meme coin frenzy, with several meme coins showing substantial gains. 
For instance, Roaring Kitty [ROAR] jumped by 175%, and the Wall Street Bets token surged by an astonishing 1,121% against the U.S. dollar. 
Execs weighs in 
Strangely, Jim Cramer, host of the CNBC television show “Mad Money” had quite a unique perspective on the situation.
Known for his aggressive investment strategies, Cramer in a recent stream at CNBC said, 
“I can’t see Gamestop, $GME, trading at $64 or even $44 and so, the responsible move is to sell, sell, sell.”  
Well, he didn’t stop there and while quoting AMC he noted, 
“$AMC is like a dead man walking.” 
The surge in GME and AMC shares began with Roaring Kitty’s return on social media on the 13th of May and has persisted with minimal pullback. 
This highlights the power of social media and the strong influence of key figures in the online trading community.
The role of social media
This scenario mirrors instances where Elon Musk influenced Dogecoin’s price through his public statements in the past.
All this brings us to a question — should such market manipulation be considered legal? 
Expressing disappointment on the same, Former SEC Chair, Jay Clayton in a recent conversation with CNBC said, 
“It bothers me on many levels— It’s a lot closer to gambling than trading and it is certainly not investing.” 
Questioning the entire situation at play, Clayton added, 
“Is a Tweet really investment advice? We’ve learned over the last five years that a Tweet is not investment advice.”
Good day for Solana meme coins 
Despite such criticism, Solana [SOL] meme coins have experienced a significant surge.
Notably, Dogwifhat [WIF], Bonk [BONK], and Popcat [POPCAT] have benefited from the positive trends currently observed in SOL meme coins.
As we move forward into the week, it will be interesting to see how things unfold and what the future holds for the meme coin industry.

Here's Why Polkadot's (DOT) Recent Price Crash Could be Good News: Analyst


																TL;DR

Despite recent price declines, analysts predict a potential rally for Polkadot (DOT), with some suggesting it could reach significant highs in the near future.
Key crypto figures remain optimistic about the token’s long-term growth, endorsing the strategy of accumulating during dips for substantial future gains.


Where is DOT Headed?
The price of Polkadot (DOT) has been on a downfall in the past weeks, plunging by 8% on a monthly scale and currently trading at around $6.50 (per CoinGecko’s data).

DOT Price, Source: CoinGecko

Despite the negative trends as of late, some analysts believe a resurgence is in the cards. The X user with over 100,000 followers – FLASH – thinks the recent price retreat could be “a textbook correction” that will eventually be replaced by a rally towards the $20 mark. “$5 level during summer hole bleedout could be attractive,” they assumed.
For their part, Crypto Thanos highlighted DOT’s potential to enter into a bull mode soon. The analyst suggested that the asset’s descending parallel channel is about to breakout, asking investors if they have already bought the dip.
Crypto Tony chipped in, too, envisioning a rally once DOT reclaims the critical resistance level of $7.50. He also advised investors to jump on the bandwagon as soon as the asset reaches that mark. 




Previous Forecasts
Michael van de Poppe and CRYPTOWZRD are among the numerous additional analysts who outlined DOT price predictions. The former presented himself as a huge fan of Polkadot, praised the protocol’s “fundamental progress “ over the years, and jumped on the bandwagon as an investor. CRYPTOWZRD claimed the asset is poised for a “volcanic eruption brewing“ should it surpass the important resistance zone of $9.60.
Most recently, the X user Dippy.eth described DOT as “the sleeping giant“ which is ready to skyrocket by 60% in the short run and much more substantially in the long term:
“For price targets short term min 60% higher. But for bull run targets they are much higher (couple of Xs). Accumulating on dips is a good strategy as DOT could be seeing new highs when the altseason fully commences.”

GameStop Crashed 30%. Is the Roaring Kitty Rally Over? - Decrypt

We do the research, you get the alpha!Get exclusive reports and access to key insights on airdrops, NFTs, and more! Subscribe now to Alpha Reports and up your game!Go to Alpha ReportsAfter two surreal days of spectacular gains, it looks like GameStop is finally crashing back down to reality.On Wednesday, GameStop stock (GME) crashed some 30% in the market’s opening minutes, to $34.12 as of this writing.That slippage wiped away a major chunk of the remarkable rally enjoyed by the stock this week, which began on Sunday when Keith Gill, aka Roaring Kitty—the meme stock influencer who architected GME’s Reddit-fueled short squeeze in 2021—appeared to return online after years of silence.Still, today’s crash has yet to wipe out the full extent of GME’s recent gains. The Nasdaq has already been automatically halted GME trading six times before 11 a.m. EST, according to NasdaqTrader.Before Roaring Kitty’s apparent return, on Friday, GameStop closed at $17.39. The influencer’s resurfacing brought the stock as high as $64.83 yesterday—an almost 4x increase from last week’s close. It’s not an unheard of gain in crypto, but it’s highly unusual on Wall Street.Some lucky traders may have walked away with millions thanks to GME’s roller coaster ride—assuming they stayed in long enough and got out in time. One trader who invested $27,000 in GME call contracts on April 24 that expire Friday, would have made $2 million off the trade.Roaring Kitty’s supposed return (the influencer has only posted GIFs and memes to Gill’s Twitter account, and hasn’t otherwise verified his identity) has also lifted other assets related to his former exploits—though those charms appear to be wearing off as well.AMC, another meme stock once favored by the influencer, is also down 30% today, to $4.82 at writing (the stock hit $11.90 at one point on Tuesday). And GME, a Solana meme coin inspired by the GameStop short squeeze saga, is down 23.9% in the last 24 hours, after surging yesterday to an all-time high.Today it's Floki Inu (FLOKI) that's been leading the meme coin pack. Earlier today the token, inspired by Elon Musk's pet Shiba Inu dog, was showing 24-hour gains of 17%, according to CoinGecko data. It's an interesting outcome because some of the messages sent by Gill in the past couple days included a video that says “the dog days are over.”Edited by Stacy Elliott.Daily Debrief NewsletterStart every day with the top news stories right now, plus original features, a podcast, videos and more.

                        Game and 3D world builder Crucible has announced the Emergence Marketplace, set for launch this Summer.According to the press release shared with Cryptonews, the novel 3D on-chain marketplace will be unique in the industry – it will focus on interoperable assets with high utility.“This means that players will be able to use what they purchase across games and worlds,” it said.Users can already sign up for early access and allow lists.Once launched, the marketplace users will be able to own, transport, share, create, trade, and sell their assets while maintaining full control over them.Emergence Marketplace is ‘Culmination of Extensive Development’
Emergence Marketplace is developed as a product of the Open Meta Association, a community of creators, game developers, and players focused on constructing and advancing the Open Metaverse.The Association was formed in collaboration with Crucible Networks to build the Open Meta DAO and the Emergence protocol.Meanwhile, Crucible itself was founded in 2018, aiming to create the tools, marketplaces, and interfaces to facilitate an Open Metaverse.Its Emergence SDK (software development kit) for game developers for popular game engines Unreal and Unity has been downloaded over 55,000 times.“Emergence Marketplace represents the culmination of extensive research and development and builds upon the success of the Emergence SDK,” the team said.Source: CrucibleNow, the new marketplace will provide creators with tools to show their work and will extend tools for developers.Furthermore, both creators and developers will gain new opportunities, channels for engaging communities, and “ways of working,” the team said.Fully Native On-Chain 3D Marketplace
Emergence has proven to be a success, said the announcement.Providing a comprehensive ‘full stack’ of developer tools that work in game engines, Emergence is “quickly growing to become the “hub” that brings together players, creators, collectors, and developers.”The addition of the Marketplace will also provide a hub for players and collectors.Furthermore, it will provide utility and rewards to its members for contributing to the open future by playing, creating, or developing.According to Ryan Gill, Founder and CEO of Crucible, “the gaming industry has established a solid, sustainable business model with 3D assets,” but “almost none of them are on-chain.”Additionally, there has been innovation over the past few years in NFT marketplaces, but these haven’t made much progress with 3D.“Now, with Emergence, we’re bridging that gap, by building a fully native 3D marketplace that’s on-chain,” Gill said.Source: CrucibleAs noted, the marketplace will focus on interoperable assets with high utility.Open Meta’s Aleissia Laidacker (who previously led the Technology, Gameplay, and AI Direction on some large game franchises such as Assassin’s Creed at Ubisoft) commented that interoperability and utility are buzzwords and may sound technical.However, they refer to player choice, she said. Interoperability, coupled with the blockchain, “means that players truly have the right to own their assets instead of just ‘renting’ them from some big platform.”

CryptoQuant Analyst Announces the Altcoin to Follow in the Bull Market: "It Left Bitcoin and Its Rivals Behind!" - Bitcoin Sistemi


Leading cryptocurrency Bitcoin surged after the SEC approved spot ETFs in January.
However, there are some altcoins that have surpassed even BTC with their rise. One of these altcoins was Toncoin (TON).


Analyzing Toncoin's performance, CryptoQuant analyst said that TON has outperformed Bitcoin by 118% since the beginning of 2024, outperforming other popular layer one chains (L1).
Stating that TON and BNB, two of the popular layer 1 blockchains, are two altcoins that managed to significantly outperform Bitcoin in 2024, the analyst said that TON is a cryptocurrency worth watching in the bull cycle.





Stating that behind this tremendous performance of TON is an active and strong community with the support of Telegram, the analyst said that TON is in an upward trend against both USD and BTC:

“Since the beginning of 2024, TON has outperformed Bitcoin by 118%, while other popular layer-one chains have struggled to find strength.
One of my favorite ways to invest in altcoins is to identify which projects have a positive trend against both USD and bitcoin values.
Of the main layer 1 blockchains, TON and BNB are the only assets that have managed to meaningfully outperform Bitcoin this year.
In my opinion, TON's relative strength against Bitcoin combined with Telegram's network effect makes it a cryptocurrency worth watching this bull run. “

Samson Mow Slams Ripple for Spreading FUD About Bitcoin and Tether, Ripple Files Motion to Seal Documents, Here's Why Ethereum ETF Could Be Denied: Crypto News Digest by U.Today


Don’t miss anything in the world of crypto with U.Today’s top three crypto news stories over the past day.Bitcoiner Samson Mow slams Ripple for spreading FUD about Bitcoin and TetherFollowing the confrontation that unfolded between Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse and Tether CEO Paolo Ardoino, Samson Mow, head of Jan3, took to social media to share his view on the situation. In his X post, Mow sided with Ardoino, writing that Ripple is now “actively spreading FUD about Tether” in order to “try and get traction on their own stablecoin.” The Jan3 CEO added that such a turn of events is not surprising for him at all, as a similar situation happened in 2022; back then, Ripple (particularly its cofounder Chris Larsen) paid $5 million to Greenpeace to start a campaign against Bitcoin, which aimed to force the change of BTC's proof-of-work consensus algorithm to a proof-of-stake one.SEC v. Ripple: Defendant files motion to seal documentsAccording to a recent update on the Ripple-SEC legal battle provided by defense lawyer James K. Filan, Ripple has filed a motion to seal or narrowly tailor some of its documents in connection with the SEC's motion for judgment and remedies. As stated by Ripple, if these confidential documents were made public, its business interests would suffer "significant harm." The company wants to seal or redact highly confidential information concerning its earnings, revenues expenses and so on. Additionally, Ripple requests to keep its contractual agreements with thirty-party business partners undisclosed; even though the company acknowledges the relevance of the fact that it provided institutional XRP buyers with discounts, it is unwilling to reveal the specific financial and pricing details. Besides, Ripple wishes to protect the identities of certain nonparty financial institutions - customers as well as employees.Here's why Ethereum ETF could be deniedIn a recent X post, James Seyffart, ETF analyst at Bloomberg Intelligence, stated that the SEC's decision to deny numerous Ethereum ETF applications this May by stating that Ethereum is a security is becoming increasingly likely. “Not a guarantee that they will do this but I think this almost guarantees that the SEC is at least considering it,” Seyffart added. The analyst's post comes as a response to finance lawyer Scott Johnsson, who claimed that the SEC is considering the security question for Ethereum in its next spot ETF order. Per Johnsson, the regulator is supposed to provide a "notice of the grounds for disapproval under consideration." The SEC argues that since the underlying asset is a security, it was improper to offer commodity-based trust shares. Interestingly, Bitcoin ETFs did not have to deal with this issue. As a reminder, on May 23 and 24, the SEC is expected to make its final decision about VanEck and ARK's Ethereum ETF filings, respectively.

Bitcoin (BTC) Gains 4% on Easing US Inflation Data - DailyCoin


        

The Bitcoin price has climbed in hopes of a relaxed monetary policy.



Lower-than-expected inflation figures have triggered optimism in the crypto market.



The possibility of a Fed rate cut this summer has been put back on the table.




Cryptocurrency markets reacted positively to signs of slowing inflation in the United States on Wednesday. The price of Bitcoin (BTC) surged over 4% to $64,500 following the release of the Consumer Price Index (CPI) report, which showed a slight decrease in inflation compared to March.



Lower-Than-Expected Inflation Bumps Bitcoin



This news offered a glimmer of hope for cryptocurrency investors who had been bracing for a prolonged period of high interest rates. Throughout 2023, inflation consistently dipped, leading many, including the Federal Reserve, to anticipate a more relaxed monetary policy in 2024. However, inflation has unexpectedly risen slightly this year, dampening hopes for immediate rate cuts.




The Wednesday CPI report indicated a 0.3% monthly increase in inflation, lower than the 0.4% recorded in March and economist predictions. Year-over-year inflation also showed a slight decline, reaching 3.4% compared to March’s 3.5%. Core CPI, excluding volatile food and energy prices, followed a similar trend with a 0.3% monthly increase and a year-over-year rise of 3.6%.



These figures, while still concerning, were enough to trigger a positive response in the crypto market. Bitcoin, which had been under pressure due to the prospect of sustained high interest rates, saw a significant price jump. The spot Bitcoin ETF, a potential catalyst for further growth, has been sidelined recently due to slowed or even reversed inflows.



Fed Rate Cut Back on the Table?



Before the CPI report, the possibility of a Fed rate cut this summer was considered unlikely, with traders only pricing in a 50% chance of a move by September. However, the easing inflation data could shift this outlook, potentially leading to a more accommodative monetary policy in the latter half of the year.



The positive reaction extended beyond the crypto market. Traditional markets also responded favorably to the softer inflation and economic data. S&P 500 futures climbed 0.5%, and the 10-year Treasury yield dropped to 4.37%. The U.S. dollar index weakened by 0.5%, and gold prices gained 0.7%.




While the long-term trajectory of inflation and interest rates remains uncertain, the latest data provides a welcome respite for cryptocurrency investors. The easing of inflation concerns could pave the way for a more bullish crypto market in the coming months.



On the Flipside




While the monthly inflation decrease is positive, year-over-year inflation is still at 3.4%, exceeding the Federal Reserve’s target of 2%.



The 10-year Treasury yield dropped slightly, indicating that a short-term trend might not convince investors to expect future inflation adjustments.



Core CPI, excluding volatile items, remains at 3.6%, which might be a more relevant indicator for long-term inflation expectations.




Why This Matters



This dip in inflation offers a potential turning point for the crypto market. A shift towards a more relaxed Federal Reserve policy, with lower interest rates on the horizon, could significantly improve investor sentiment and lead to a broader market rally. This could breathe new life into stalled projects and potentially attract new capital to the cryptocurrency space.

Bitcoin Miners Are Selling Again, Can BTC Price Hold $60,000? | Bitcoinist.com


								Bitcoin is still holding steady above the $60,000 price mark, but recent actions by miners could disturb this stability very soon. The recent halving cut the block reward from 6.25 BTC to 3.125 BTC, meaning miners now receive half as much for verifying transactions and mining new blocks. As noted in a recent report by Kaiko, miner revenues have plummeted since the halving, and miners are beginning to feel the pressure. 
Bitcoin Under Increased Pressure
Bitcoin miners largely rely on two revenue streams to keep operating: the mining reward and transaction fees. The Bitcoin market is cyclical and each halving has historically led to an increase in selling pressure from the miners. Data shows that the recent April halving has led to a fall in the Bitcoin hash rate with mining profitability now at its lowest point in three years.

For miners with high operating costs, this drastic mining pay cut means they have to find other ways to generate income and fund their business. For many, the only option is to sell some of the BTC they hold. According to findings, Marathon Digital and Riot Platforms, two of the biggest Bitcoin miners, currently hold BTC worth over $1.6 billion between them.
Interestingly, the spike in Bitcoin network fees before and after the halving has mostly offset operational costs and compelled the need to sell. According to Kaiko, network fees accounted for 16% of BTC earned by Marathon Digital in April, a jump from 4.5% in March. 
However, the recent trading activity and volume decline in the past few days means revenue from the network fees is dropping and the likelihood of miners selling their holdings is increasing.

What’s Next For BTC?
At the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading at $61,888 and is on a 1.20% decrease in the past 24 hours. The next three to six months will be crucial in determining how much the halving and miner selling impacts the Bitcoin price. If demand remains strong and most large miners can weather the revenue drop without selling too many of their holdings, the price could hold steady and even start to climb.

Fortunately, there are still a lot of catalysts for price surges that could offset the looming selloff from miners. Hence, Bitcoin has a good chance of defending the $60,000 price level. An example is the mainstream adoption of BTC through Spot Bitcoin ETFs. Some Bitcoin whales are also taking advantage of the price consolidation to top up their holdings. On-chain data shows that short-term holder whales are now accumulating around 200,000 BTC per week.

It’s time for Congress to protect the crypto henhouse - Blockworks


We find ourselves in a strange interregnum for crypto policy in the United States. 
On one side, Securities and Exchange Commission Chair Gary Gensler is ramping up an all-out war against the crypto industry, accelerating enforcement actions and saber-rattling, perhaps in anticipation of being replaced after November’s elections. The aim seems straightforward: Let’s do as much damage to crypto while we have the chance. 
On the other side, a growing bipartisan group in Congress is working, ploddingly, towards new crypto-focused legislation in an acknowledgment that the current status quo is untenable. 
The slow and steady legislative pace gives Chair Gensler the chance to be the fox in the crypto henhouse while our lawmakers are occupied with other jobs on the farm. 
The insatiable campaign against crypto undermines the work that Congress has done so far to address crypto’s long-standing regulatory quagmire. It’s time the farmers regain control and flush the fox out.
Indeed, Congress has made notable progress towards addressing key regulatory issues, even if their efforts remain imperfect and incomplete. Some of the pieces of draft legislation could prove a net positive for the crypto ecosystem with considered revisions. Rep. Patrick McHenry and Rep. Maxine Waters’ yet-to-be-released stablecoin bill has garnered decent bipartisan support and could reach a House floor vote this session. McHenry’s FIT21 bill on crypto market structure is headed for a full-House vote at the end of May.  
Just last week, a bipartisan House coalition repealed the SEC’s punitive SAB 121 accounting rules for crypto — a clear rebuke of Gensler’s aggressive tactics, and a sign there is Congressional appetite to move quicker than the typical glacial speed they are accustomed to with core crypto issues. 
These moves demonstrate that lawmakers at least seem to grasp that if they don’t act soon to rein in Gensler’s crusade, they may end up protecting just a rump of what was once a vibrant American crypto industry.
What is to be done? Congress faces two key constraints: It’s an election year when major legislative lifts are difficult, and they must consolidate enough bipartisan consensus to push comprehensive crypto legislation over the finish line.
Fortunately, new polling indicates growing public engagement on the crypto issue which could provide productive tailwinds. 
According to a recent Harris Poll, most voters don’t trust elected officials to understand innovative technologies like crypto, and over half are concerned about policymakers stifling innovation through heavy-handed regulation. Those sentiments are warning lights for the SEC and are opportunities for members of Congress. Former President Trump’s recent overtures embracing crypto and courting crypto-aligned voters should also add impetus for Congressional action.
Read more from our opinion section: No, ETH isn’t suddenly a security now
Ultimately, lawmakers must recognize that an overzealous regulator is attempting to unilaterally decide the fate of an ecosystem that is vitally important to America’s future economic competitiveness and technological leadership. This circumvents the proper role of Congress in setting foundational rules, and our elected officials should reassert their prerogative rather than ceding that power to crypto’s most fervent detractors.
The clock is ticking. As election day approaches, the impetus for Chair Gensler to gobble up even more crypto hens will grow stronger. Our nation’s legislative farmers must return to the crucial task of protecting and catalyzing the homegrown crypto ecosystem. They’re close to drafting fit-for-purpose rules that would clarify how the government understands and regulates crypto, though much more work needs to be done. 
If they don’t move quickly, they may find the hen house empty and wonder why they didn’t act sooner.

Grok Army Suggests Potential Reason for OpenAI Cofounder's Resignation, But There's a Catch


An insider from the Dogecoin and X teams who calls himself “DogeDesigner” (@cb_doge) has caught the attention of the community of Grok supporters with his tweet about the top executives who suddenly began resigning from xAI’s main rival, OpenAI.Earlier, the news of the company’s cofounder, Ilya Sutskever, made waves in the tech community. Later, it became known that another high-ranking team member of OpenAI sent in his resignation.The community and Dogecoin founder suggested a reason why this may be happening. While Billy Markus expressed hope, the rest of the Grok community seemed to be just making fun of the situation.Here's hypothetical reason why "everyone leaving OpenAI"@cb_doge tweeted a rhetorical question: “Why is everyone leaving OpenAI?” By this he meant not only cofounder Ilya Sutskever but also Jan Leike, co-leading "superalignment" at the same company.Earlier today, Leike tweeted that he has called it quits with OpenAI after Sutskever’s announcement on X. The Grok community began suggesting to @cb_doge reasons as to why these resignations are taking place all of a sudden. The main reason that they jokingly suggested was “because of Grok.” One of the Dogecoin cofounders, Billy Markus, tweeted that he hopes Ilya Sutskever will decide to join the xAI team after leaving OpenAI.DOGE cofounder criticizes ChatGPT-4oAs reported earlier, Markus, known on the X platform as Shibetoshi Nakamoto, shared his disappointment at the most recent upgrade made by OpenAI to its ChatGPT product. The company recently rolled out GPT-4o. The creator of the original meme cryptocurrency, DOGE, tested the updated product and shared the results of his experiments.Markus set ChatGPT-4o the task of creating a funny meme, and then making it “even funnier,” then 10x funnier and so on. The result proved to be discouraging for him as he tweeted that none of those images made him laugh.The Dogecoin creator is known as a fan of xAI’s Grok AI and of Elon Musk, the owner of the X platform. Frequently, he comments on Musk’s tweets, providing support to the innovative tech entrepreneur.

China busts $2 billion USDT money laundering operation


Police in China have announced the dismantling of a large underground banking gang accused of facilitating illegal transactions with almost $2 billion worth of tether (USDT).
Sichuan and Chongqing authorities said on Tuesday that 193 suspects across 26 Chinese provinces have been arrested as a result of the operation. 
According to local media, the gang allegedly used USDT to evade China’s foreign exchange regulations and provide a means for criminals to send their funds overseas, transacting 13.8 billion yuan ($1.9 billion).

Two ‘dens’ in Fujian and Hunan belonging to the gang were reportedly destroyed by authorities in 2023 and 149 million yuan ($20.6 million) of funds linked to the gang were frozen as part of the case. 
The gang’s illegal foreign exchange reportedly committed “financial fraud, job-related crimes, obstruction of drug management, smuggling of goods prohibited by the state…. obstruction of credit card management, defrauding export tax refunds and other criminal activities.”
USDT has also been used to pay gold smugglers in Nepal shifting 33kg of the precious metal into the country before returning to Tibet with sacks of cash, musk, and medicinal caterpillar fungus called yarsagumba.
Additionally, the United Nations claims that USDT is at the heart of a ‘parallel banking system’ created by organized crime in Southeast Asia. It said in a report, “Online gambling platforms, and especially those that are operating illegally, have emerged as among the most popular vehicles for cryptocurrency-based money launderers, particularly for those using Tether or USDT on the TRON25 blockchain.”

Bitcoin Boom Sparks Surge In Crypto Wallet Recovery Services: 'It's Just Pure Economics' - Benzinga

As the Bitcoin BTC/USD price continues to surge, investors who have lost access to their accounts are turning to crypto wallet recovery firms in droves.What Happened: The increase in bitcoin prices has led to a spike in calls to wallet recovery services, Reuters reported on Wednesday. These calls are primarily from retail investors who have lost access to their digital wallets where their cryptocurrencies are stored. This loss of access is often due to forgotten passwords or loss of access to two-factor authentication devices.Steve Sosnick, chief strategist at Interactive Brokers., said, “What would be driving this trend is the fact that bitcoin prices are at $60,000, not $30,000… it’s just pure economics.”A Swiss firm that uses Nvidia’s graphic processing unit cards to run AI models to access stranded wallets saw a tenfold increase in requests in the first quarter, compared to the same period last year. Similarly, Germany-based ReWallet reported a 334% increase in requests in the previous quarter. These services are not cheap, with firms charging a 20% fee on the wallets’ contents, payable only upon successful retrieval. However, the high price of bitcoin seems to be incentivizing investors to recover their lost access.See Also: Bitcoin, Ethereum, Dogecoin Under Pressure From Macro Data: ‘Healthy Corrections Are Part Of The Game,’ Says TraderWhy It Matters: The recent surge in Bitcoin prices can be attributed to a number of factors. Bitcoin has been maintaining the $60,000 support level, a stability that has been sustained since early May. This stability, coupled with the reimbursement of customers by FTX, the cryptocurrency exchange that filed for bankruptcy in November 2022, has likely boosted investor confidence. However, the recent slide in cryptocurrency markets following the release of April’s Producer Price Inflation (PPI) data serves as a reminder of the volatility of the sector.Price Action: At the time of writing the article, Bitcoin was trading 3.48% higher at $63,783.18 on Wednesday, according to Benzinga Pro.Read Next: Bitcoin, Ethereum, Dogecoin Price And Sentiment Up, As Banks Disclose BTC Holdings: A ‘GME Moment’ ComingImage via Shutterstock

Forget memecoins, Bitcoin is driving the bull run - NBX Warsaw

Bitcoin, not memecoins, will continue to be a pivotal driving force in this bull run courtesy of Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) and the influence of the halving. This was a key takeaway from day one of the Next Block Expo in Warsaw as prominent industry insiders unpacking major trends of the current market cycle. Bitcoin (BTC) remains a clear focal point and driver of sentiment midway through 2024, as four experts told Cointelegraph on stage.Cointelegraph's Gareth Jenkinson moderating the panel at Next Block Expo in Warsaw. Source: Simply StakingAdrian Zduńczyk, founder of the trading education platform The Birb Nest, said that historical data around previous halvings suggests significant upside for BTC into 2025.“From 2011 through to the peak of 2013, we observed a 9,000% growth in the price appreciation,” Zduńczyk said. Related: Bitcoin could top $100K but only if ‘high-yield rate’ falls below 7% — AnalystHighlighting that Bitcoin bullruns in 2017 and 2021 produced 3,000% and 700% gains respectively in the value of BTC, Zduńczyk said Bitcoin remains a core indicator of market performance:“Those are the facts. There's no way to refute that. Bitcoin halving history has brought a massive price rise. Hence relying on the facts, the data is very favorable.”Ben Yorke, ecosystem vice president at exchange platform WooX, also highlighted that there was no longer regulatory ambiguity around Bitcoin. Related: Bitcoin bottomed at $56K?

Regulatory green light is good for BitcoinCriticisms of Bitcoin’s utility are also being nullified as the proliferation of the Lightning network and other functionalities that allow a user to maintain full custody of their BTC. Yorke said that adoption of Bitcoin services like Lightning will ultimately quash these arguments.“For the last ten years, we've been building a lot of infrastructure with applications like Lightning. Once these applications take off, the utility naysayers will have very few places to hide.”Miko Matsumura, general partner of cryptocurrency asset fund Gumi Crypto, echoed these sentiments, suggesting that the development of infrastructure to improve the ability to use Bitcoin for payments would be an additional driver of capital into the ecosystem.Zduńczyk added that the timing of regulatory greenlights of Bitcoin ETFs reflected the seasonality of investment cycles, with summer months often driving market performance of the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq:“The ETFs nicely aligned because there was demand from the institutions and there was a legal infrastructure. All those big pension funds, all the central banks that are actually entering the space from 2025 onward.”Zduńczyk also highlighted historical trends around U.S. presidential elections driving up performance of traditional markets spilling over into Bitcoin in years past. Magazine: Meme coins: Betrayal of crypto’s ideals… or its true purpose?

Stablecoin Market Cools in May as Bulls Seek Signs of Revival - DailyCoin


        

The cryptocurrency market has been subdued in May. Bitcoin has failed to capitalize on halving hype so far.



Analysts have been divided on whether there will be a summer slump or a bullish resurgence.



Stablecoin activity has revealed reduced investor confidence, but a recent influx has sparked hope.




The cryptocurrency market has experienced a subdued May so far, with Bitcoin (BTC) failing to capitalize on the momentum of the earlier halving event. While some analysts predict a summer of consolidation, others remain cautiously optimistic, looking for indicators of a potential bullish resurgence.




This month, Bitcoin faced downward pressure, with altcoins mirroring the trend. Memecoins, known for their volatility and community-driven hype, were a rare exception, managing some gains. However, the broader market sentiment leaned bearish.



Stablecoins Offer Clues to Investor Behavior



Analysts turned to stablecoin activity to gauge investor sentiment. Stablecoins, cryptocurrencies pegged to a fiat currency like the US dollar, are often used as a safe haven during market downturns. Examining on-chain data from CryptoQuant, the focus was placed on two key metrics: active addresses and exchange reserves.

The number of unique active stablecoin addresses, which tracks both sending and receiving activity, has been trending downward since mid-April. This mirrors a similar pattern observed in February and March when a surge in active addresses coincided with a strong market rally that saw Bitcoin break the $70,000 barrier. 



The recent decline suggests reduced trading activity, potentially indicating a lack of bullish conviction among investors. Exchange reserves, representing stablecoins held on exchanges, offer another glimpse into investor behavior. 



While these reserves have mostly consolidated throughout 2024, a sharp drop from late April to mid-May highlighted a decline in buying power. This implies that stablecoin holders were less inclined to convert their holdings into other crypto assets during this period.



Chart Showing All Stablecoin Reserves on Exchanges. Source: CryptoQuant.



However, a recent influx of stablecoins onto exchanges on May 13 offered a potential sign of renewed buying interest. If this trend continues, it could be seen as a positive development for bulls.



Tether Dominance: A Signal for Bulls or Bears?



The dominance of Tether (USDT), the leading stablecoin, offers another data point. The Tether Dominance chart tracks USDT’s market capitalization as a percentage of the total crypto market cap. An upward trend in this metric indicates a preference for holding stablecoins, which can be interpreted as investors staying on the sidelines. 



Conversely, a downtrend often accompanies market rallies. Currently, Tether Dominance is positioned above a key support level. While a move toward the resistance level is anticipated, a drop below this support could be a bullish signal. 



However, thorough technical and fundamental analysis of individual crypto assets remains crucial for informed investment decisions beyond relying solely on Tether Dominance. The coming weeks will be crucial in determining the direction of the cryptocurrency market. 



On the Flipside




Stablecoin data only reflects a portion of investor sentiment. It doesn’t account for investors holding other assets.



The gains seen in memecoins might be temporary and unrelated to the broader market trend. They can be highly susceptible to social media hype and unpredictable swings.




Why This Matters



This article offers valuable insight into investor sentiment by analyzing stablecoin activity and Tether dominance. A resurgence in stablecoin trading and a drop in Tether dominance could signal a return of bullish momentum in the broader cryptocurrency market, potentially leading to a breakout from the current subdued phase.

Bitcoin Hash Ribbons Form Capitulation Signal: What It Means


																On-chain data shows the Bitcoin Hash Ribbons have recently gone through a crossover. Here’s what it could mean for the cryptocurrency.
Bitcoin Hash Ribbons Suggest Miner Capitulation Is On
As explained by CryptoQuant community manager Maartunn in a Quicktake post, miners are capitulating right now if the Hash Ribbons indicator is to be believed. This on-chain metric is generally used to determine whether miners are in distress.
BTC runs on a proof-of-work (PoW) consensus mechanism where miners play the role of validators and compete against each other using computing power to get a chance to add the next block to the chain.
This computing power, when measured across the network, can provide insight into the health of the miners as a whole. Due to this reason, the Hash Ribbons indicator makes use of this total Bitcoin “Hashrate” to judge the situation of the miners.

	Related Reading



Naturally, a rise in the Hashrate suggests the network is attracting miners right now, while a decline could imply low profitability is making some of these validators pull out from BTC.
The Hash Ribbons indicator uses two moving averages (MA) of the Hashrate, 30-day and 60-day, to represent whether these behaviors are particularly intense or not at the moment. When the 30-day ribbon moves under the 60-day one, it suggests that miners are mass capitulating. On the other hand, the opposite cross suggests network is observing growth again.
Now, what relevance do these trends have for Bitcoin? According to Charles Edwards, the creator of the Hash Ribbons, the miners have historically been quite resilient, and they only quit when things get especially bad for the cryptocurrency. As such, the market may be more likely to approach a bottom whenever these chain validators show capitulation.
Below is a chart that shows how the miners’ behaviour has looked recently according to this indicator:
Looks like the two ribbons have gone through a cross recently | Source: CryptoQuant
As Maartunn has highlighted in the graph, the Bitcoin Hash Ribbons have seen a crossover recently. More specifically, the cross has involved the 30-day moving under the 60-day, implying that the miners are capitulating.
Miner profits come down to three factors: BTC spot price, transaction fees, and electricity costs in the area that they are located in. Historically, the fees has been quite low in comparison to the block rewards, so miner financials have been dependent on the price (as the block rewards only have this variable attached to them) and electricity prices.
Recently, the BTC price has been stuck in consolidation while the block rewards have been slashed in half in the latest Halving event. This has led to tightening revenues for these chain validators, so it’s not surprising to see that the miners with the least efficient machines have already started ditching the network in hordes.

In the chart, past instances of miner capitulation are shown with the green lines. It’s visible that while miner capitulation has generally indeed occurred near profitable buying points into the asset, these bottoms haven’t immediately appeared after the crossovers have occurred. As the analyst notes, “It unfolds in the subsequent days and weeks after less efficient miners throw in the towel.”

Bitcoin Price Hits $65k Amid Positive CPI Data and Market Sentiment - Tokenist


					
Neither the author, Tim Fries, nor this website, The Tokenist, provide financial advice. Please consult our website policy prior to making financial decisions.



Bitcoin’s price touched the $65,000 barrier, trading at $64,961.60 as of 11:38 AM ET on May 15, 2024, representing a over 5% increase over the past 24 hours. The cryptocurrency’s upward trajectory follows softer-than-expected Consumer Price Index (CPI) data, signaling a positive market reaction to the latest inflation news. This surge has propelled Bitcoin to its highest levels since March 2024, when it achieved record highs surpassing $73,000.



CPI Data Eases Inflation Fears, Blosters Market Sentiment for Bitcoin



The release of the CPI data, which indicated a more stable inflationary environment, has bolstered market sentiment and contributed to Bitcoin’s recent price surge. Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell’s suggestion that interest rates will not increase further has also provided a more favorable backdrop for Bitcoin investments. However, the cryptocurrency has faced downward pressure from regulatory threats and a decline in capital inflows into crypto investment products. Additionally, Bitcoin’s recent halving event, which reduced the per-block coin emission to 3.125 BTC, has influenced miner profitability and overall market dynamics.





CPI In Line with Expectations in April



The CPI for All Urban Consumers (CPI-U) rose by 0.3% in April 2024, a slight decrease from the 0.4% increase recorded in March. Year-over-year, the all-items index increased by 3.4%, aligning with economists’ expectations and marginally lower than the 3.5% rise seen in March. Core CPI, which excludes food and energy prices, increased by 0.3% in April, consistent with forecasts but down from the 0.4% increase in March. The indexes for shelter and gasoline were the primary drivers of the monthly CPI increase, collectively accounting for more than 70% of the overall rise. 



The CPI is a crucial indicator of inflation, reflecting the cost of living and influencing the Federal Reserve’s monetary policy decisions. Stable or lower-than-expected CPI figures can alleviate market concerns about aggressive interest rate hikes, which typically hurt investment assets like Bitcoin. The April CPI data has raised hopes for potential Fed rate cuts, although current inflation levels and economic growth still warrant caution. Moreover, CPI data affects consumer confidence and spending patterns, which are critical for economic health and investment climates.



The Relationship Between Bitcoin and Inflation Data



Bitcoin’s price often responds to inflation data and monetary policy signals, as some investors perceive it as a hedge against inflation. Positive CPI data can lead to a stronger dollar and higher interest rates, potentially reducing Bitcoin’s appeal as an alternative investment. Conversely, softer inflation data, as observed in April 2024, can boost Bitcoin prices by lowering expectations of aggressive rate hikes, thus maintaining a more favorable investment environment.



In addition to CPI data, Bitcoin’s market behavior is influenced by broader economic indicators, such as retail sales and the Producer Price Index (PPI), which can provide early signals of inflation trends. Furthermore, regulatory developments and capital flows into cryptocurrency products further intertwine Bitcoin’s performance with inflation and economic policies.

Analyst Drops Bomb: Bitcoin Is A Better Investment Than MicroStrategy Stock


								Jim Cramer, the outspoken host of CNBC’s Mad Money, has caused a stir in the financial sector by endorsing Bitcoin (BTC) over MicroStrategy stock (MSTR). This recommendation follows despite MSTR’s notable year-to-date performance of 85%, compared to Bitcoin’s 125% gain.

Cramer’s endorsement, however, is met with a dose of skepticism. The financial guru is known for his sometimes-inaccurate predictions, with some even claiming his recommendations have the opposite effect – a phenomenon known as the “Inverse Cramer” theory.
MicroStrategy Doubles Down On Bitcoin
While Cramer throws shade at MicroStrategy, the company remains a staunch Bitcoin advocate. CEO Michael Saylor is a vocal “Bitcoin Maxi,” holding a significant personal stake in the cryptocurrency and spearheading the company’s hefty BTC acquisitions. This unwavering commitment stands in stark contrast to Cramer’s sudden shift.


Bitcoin ETF Outflows Cast A Shadow
Cramer’s advice also coincides with a period of uncertainty for Bitcoin ETFs. Grayscale, the largest Bitcoin ETF management company, has seen a recent exodus of investors due to fees associated with their product. Additionally, newly launched Bitcoin ETFs in Hong Kong have experienced more redemptions than deposits for several days, indicating a cautious investor sentiment.

Sell Pressure Dampens Bitcoin’s Momentum
Adding fuel to the fire, the Bitcoin market itself is facing headwinds. A recent price drop below $62,000 is accompanied by substantial sell pressure on spot markets, raising concerns about a potential downward trend.
Is The ‘Inverse Cramer’ Curse Upon Us?
With Cramer’s past record and the “Inverse Cramer” theory swirling, some investors might be hesitant to follow his current Bitcoin recommendation. If history repeats itself, his endorsement could unintentionally trigger a sell-off.

Cramer’s Comments: A Double-Edged Sword For Crypto Awareness
Despite the uncertainty surrounding his call, Cramer’s foray into the Bitcoin conversation has a silver lining. Discussions about cryptocurrency by prominent figures like Cramer can raise public awareness about blockchain technology, potentially attracting new investors to the digital asset space.

The Verdict: A Gamble In A Murky Market
Cramer’s sudden shift in stance towards Bitcoin leaves investors in a quandary. While Bitcoin offers higher potential returns than MicroStrategy stock, recent market trends and Cramer’s own track record suggest a degree of risk. Ultimately, the decision to invest in Bitcoin directly or through MicroStrategy remains a gamble in a currently murky market.

According to Château d’Esclans’ website, Garrus rosé is made from a vineyard featuring 100-year-old wines and fermented in new-age oak barrels, making it the vineyard’s “finest wine.”Buyers of the Garrus rosé NFT can choose from three select bottle sizes: Magnums, Jeroboams, or the massive 1.5-gallon Methuselah.Additionally, purchasers will be given a September VIP tour of the winery and vineyards alongside three guests. They will have lunch with the winery’s founder, Sacha Lichine, or Vice President Paul Chevalier while receiving their name etched on a barrel.The bidding for a portion of the sought-after NFT Garrus rosé bottle will start at $22,000 and closes May 31.In 2019, LVMH bought a 55% stake in Château d’Esclans, though the amount is undisclosed.Louis Vuitton Expands Into Metaverse And NFTs
LVMH’s investment in the NFT-linked winery marks one of its latest ventures in its long and storied history of developing luxury digital products in the web3.In August 2021, the luxury giant unveiled a free-to-play NFT offering called Louis: The Game. The game educated players on the brand while simultaneously gifting them with digital rewards.In January 2022, LVMH CEO Bernard Arnault further highlighted the fashion house’s focus on its metaverse expansion, claiming it could have a “positive impact” if “done well.”By June 2023, the company launched its Web3 application-only VIA project alongside a $41,000 digital chest modeled after the iconic LV trunk, fittingly named “The Treasure Trunk.”A company statement at the time said the project was “designed for those who seek to travel through new dreams and new realities and collect unique creations along the way.”Most recently, the company announced the sale of its NFT-linked varsity jacket for its VIA NFT holders as part of a collaboration with record producer Pharrell Williams.The partnership between BlockBar and and the LVMH-owned Château d’Esclans may signal a growing desire to merge Web3 technologies into the luxury food and beverage space.

                        Wednesday, May 15, 2024 – Solana meme coin Slothana ($SLOTH) has been making new all-time highs as it pulls in buyers eager to take pole position for even bigger gains to come.Currently priced at $0.035, $SLOTH was trading as high as $0.0565 at the beginning of the week.Now bulls are targeting $0.10 for upside of 185% in the near term.If word on the crypto grapevine is correct, $SLOTH could easily surpass that price target, with meme coins continuing to outperform the rest of the crypto market – and Solana-based tokens are leading the way.Rumors of a top 10 centralized exchange listing is set to add to the momentum created by a token burn mechanism that has seen bulls charge into the $SLOTH market.The most recent $1 million burn led to a price pump shortly after the event news was posted on X.There are now more than 36,700 token holders of $SLOTH in self-custody wallets, not to mention a growing band of centralized exchanges (CEXs) clamoring to list the coin.Slothana burns $1m worth of Slothana when the price appreciates an additional cent, as set out in an X post on the 10th May, that has so far had 219k views as the excitement spreads.More whales poised to dive into the Slothana market as CEX listings grow
With early presale buyers sitting on gains of 3x, there has been predictable profit-taking by savvy buyers looking to book ROI.At the same time, the latest meme coin theme to sweep the market – the reignition of the meme stock craze – has seen some attention pulled away from other areas of the market.GME, KITTY and AMC have all seen stellar gains in recent days.However, the start of the European session has seen the first signs that this latest fad may be waning, which will likely help to refocus market participants’ interest on other areas of the meme coin space.Meme stock diversion notwithstanding, Slothana has still been a persistent trender in the hot top 10 pairs on Dextools and other trading sites.$SLOTH’s recent price momentum combined with what could be price-moving news flow around CEX listings means it is likely to see a new influx of whale traders imminently.This whale bought $47k (332 SOL) worth of $SLOTH earlier today – expect more of the same in the coming hours as the rumor mill takes hold:https://solscan.io/tx/3sJxTbLcqXCZMGrLbdhKdVCvjW5czdKfA1vhKrMSG1Du9LGwBByZRMyYU1wPXc4K5UTu82bjESDbiiqQizhAB62uPerhaps helping to spur listing rumors has been the organic listings that $SLOTH has been attracting as it broke through the $100 million market capitalization mark on Monday.Poloniex, XT.com and Bitrue centralized exchanges have all added the token to their trading venues in the past couple of days, turning on the taps for more volume to enter the SLOTH/SOL trading pair.$SLOTH trading at an inviting price for new money – don’t miss the next pump
Although $SLOTH is trading 28% lower today, as news of impending major listings start to swirl and, presumably, an announcement from the team is forthcoming, the price is set to rocket again. Take the current pullback as a breather and opportunity to either add to an existing position or open a new one.Trading volume is an exceedingly healthy $25 million at the time of writing.Meanwhile, volatility is increasing, providing even more opportunity for day traders, but also for those with the patience to allow the price to come to them rather than trying to catch a falling knife.Putting that another way, $SLOTH buy orders between today’s low of $0.026 and the current price around the $0.035 level, will likely be a good region to take advantage of a CEX-induced price acceleration to $0.10.Taking a position in the $0.030 area delivers a handsome risk-reward ratio of 5 if the price, as postulated here, reaches 0.01 in the near term (measured from a stop-loss of $0.016), defined as the next week or so, depending on CEX news flow timings.The DEXTools link can be found here.$SLOTH the next $WIF is in the vanguard of the Solana meme coin wave
In a measure of the interest in the project, Slothana raised $15 million in its recent presale, as the frenzy around SOL meme coins remains unabated.Tokens such as DogWifHat ($WIF), Bonk ($BONK), Book of Meme ($BOME) and Popcat ($POPCAT) have all done spectacularly well, and $SLOTH is on the cusp of joining their ranks.Ongoing presales for Dogeverse and Sealana are a further indication of the red-hot nature of the SOL meme coin marketplace.Slothana is in the vanguard of this movement and today’s price could well be the lowest crypto traders are ever likely to see.Keep up with the latest burns and other developments on Slothana’s X account and Telegram group.Buy SLOTH Here

2 cryptocurrencies to reach $100 billion market cap in the first half of 2024


Bitcoin (BTC) recent surge to a record high of $73,750, followed by a pullback to $61,000, has set the stage for what many in the cryptocurrency sector believe could be the onset of an altcoin season. Analysts’ diverse predictions hint at a massive upswing in altcoin valuations.
This ongoing bullish sentiment particularly benefits several cryptocurrencies on the verge of significant market cap milestones, notably the $100 billion mark. 
Consequently, Finbold has identified two cryptocurrencies likely to surpass this threshold.


BNB Chain (BNB)
BNB, the native token of Binance, is showing robust potential to reach and potentially exceed a $100 billion market cap. This potential is anchored in Binance’s continuous strategic expansions and innovative developments within its ecosystem.
Currently holding the fourth position in the crypto market by market cap, BNB boasts a valuation of approximately $85.6 billion and trades at $580.28, marking a 2% increase in the last 24 hours.

During this period, BNB has seen a trading volume exceeding $1.95 billion, a 12% increase, signaling renewed investor interest and confidence in its growth prospects.
Recent price fluctuations have led to a surge in liquidations across the BNB network. Over the past few days, positions worth over $20 million have been liquidated, with more than $1.15 million liquidated on May 14th alone. 
Despite these losses, traders remain optimistic about BNB’s long-term potential, as evidenced by the increasing number of long positions.
The BNB Chain ecosystem continues to grow, integrating 35 new decentralized applications (dApps) into its Web3 Wallet. This integration enhances BNB’s utility and demand, covering various sectors, including gaming, finance, and trading, thus increasing user engagement.
With a year-to-date price increase of 86% and a current market cap of approximately $85.5 billion, BNB requires a 14% increase to surpass the $100 billion threshold. Given the ongoing market growth and further platform expansions, this goal appears within reach.
Solana (SOL)
Solana (SOL), currently the fifth-largest cryptocurrency by market cap, stands at $68,472,570,217 and is backed by strong investor confidence. 
The Solana ecosystem has been vibrant, particularly with SOL-based meme coins like the WIF token and BONK seeing significant trading volume increases. These trends highlight growing investor interest and positively impact Solana’s market value.

Despite experiencing network outages, Solana maintains a solid market presence and trades above crucial support levels. The ecosystem is thriving, with a marked increase in decentralized exchange (DEX) trading volumes and new projects enhancing its utility. 
Continuous network stability and scalability improvements are essential for maintaining investor confidence and supporting market cap growth.
Recently, Solana has outpaced Ethereum (ETH) in daily trading volumes, raising discussions about its potential to challenge Ethereum’s dominance. 
On May 12, Solana generated more transaction fees and Maximum Extractable Value (MEV) than Ethereum for the first time, although Ethereum’s total transaction fees remained higher at $1.82 million compared to Solana’s $1.19 million,
Solana needs a 41% increase to achieve a $100 billion market cap. Supported by strong fundamentals and the bullish market conditions following the Bitcoin halving, Solana’s trajectory looks promising. 
As of now, Solana is valued at $153.05, showing daily gains of nearly 6.6%
With a year-to-date price increase of 50.53%, Solana is on a robust growth path, driven by its technological advancements and expanding ecosystem.
Both BNB and Solana are strategically positioned to potentially achieve the $100 billion market cap milestone, driven by their ecosystem developments, technological enhancements, and the prevailing bullish sentiment in the market. 
However, the inherent volatility of the cryptocurrency market necessitates cautious investment. Investors should continuously monitor market trends and individual asset performance to capitalize on these opportunities effectively.

Bitcoin's Prospects Brighten Despite Recent Price Volatility After April's Halving

However, the retreat likely stemmed from macro factors, specifically hawkish comments by the Federal Reserve. These ignited a "risk-off" mentality as an interest rate cut became more unlikely in 2024, with a hike becoming possible. Since then, economic data has been weaker than expected, making a hike very unlikely for now. This shift has put the risk trade back on, setting an immediate floor in BTC prices, which have since recovered above $60,000. It also suggests a shift back to supply and demand factors for bitcoin, which appear favorable for higher prices.

Exploring Ethereum's Staking Expansion: Potential for Growth and Innovation

The next Ethereum upgrade, Pectra, will likely take place by the end of 2024, or in early 2025. One of the key proposals, EIP 7251, can provide a better UX for validators to earn staking yield. This proposal will increase the max effective balance of validators from 32 to 2048. Leading staking service providers, like Coinbase, are managing more than 130,000 validators already. The lift in maximum effective balance allows these providers to consolidate the number of validators and ultimately increase efficiency and lower the cost of operation.

Robinhood Rolls Out Solana Staking in Europe, Offering 5% APY


							

Robinhood Crypto introduces Solana staking in Europe with around 5% APY.



The feature is Robinhood’s first staking product, which chose Solana for its EU popularity.



Robinhood’s expansion of crypto services in Europe comes amid its U.S. regulatory scrutiny.




Prominent American trading platform Robinhood Crypto has launched Solana (SOL) staking for its European customers. Robinhood announced this development in a press statement dated Wednesday, May 15.



Emphatically, European users of Robinhood Crypto can now stake their Solana holdings directly through the app starting today. This development marks Robinhood’s first foray into crypto-staking products exclusively available to its European customers.



The decision to select Solana for Robinhood’s inaugural staking product was influenced by the token’s popularity among its EU customer base. Besides, Johann Kerbrat, the general manager of Robinhood Crypto, highlighted the simplicity of staking on the Solana network compared to Ethereum. 



Kerbrat cited Solana’s shorter bonding period of approximately two days, unlike Ethereum’s variable period, which can extend from several days to weeks.



Meanwhile, Kerbrat noted the new feature will offer an approximate annual percentage yield (APY) of 5% at launch. While the initial APY is subject to change based on the fluctuating nature of staking rewards, Robinhood’s offering is shy of Coinbase’s estimated 5.42% reward for Solana stakers. 









Notably, Robinhood Crypto debuted in the European Union in December as a dedicated crypto trading application. Registered and regulated in Lithuania, the app has seen significant downloads, particularly in Poland, Italy, and Lithuania. 



The EU version of the app lists 33 tokens, surpassing the 15 crypto assets available on Robinhood’s U.S. trading platform. Notably, SOL and Solana-based memecoins like BONK and Dogwifhat (WIF) are accessible in the EU but not in the U.S.



Robinhood’s expansion of crypto services in Europe comes as its U.S. counterpart faces regulatory scrutiny. Recently, Robinhood received a Wells Notice from the SEC concerning its crypto listings. 



Kerbrat emphasized that Robinhood and its EU crypto branch operate as separate business entities. As such, the European operations remain unaffected by the ongoing developments in the US.

Interactive Brokers Rolls Out Bitcoin, Ethereum and Other Crypto Trading Services in UK | Coinspeaker



Interactive Brokers, one of the leading global electronic brokers based in the United States, is expanding its presence in the crypto industry with the rollout of digital asset trading services to British customers through its UK unit.

In an official press release on Wednesday, May 15, the company announced that it has added support for buying and selling various cryptocurrencies to expand its business offerings. Investors in the region can now trade Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (Ether), Litecoin (LTC), and Bitcoin Cash (BCH) along with other traditional investment products offered by the firm.
Interactive Brokers Extends Crypto Trading to UK Customers
The move comes five months after the company teamed up with OSL Digital Securities (OSL) to introduce crypto trading services to retail customers in Hong Kong in November last year.




The company started its crypto journey in July 2021 with a focus on retail investors. However, a few months after the initial launch, Interactive Brokers opened trading for institutional customers in the country.
Now, the company is extending its crypto services to UK customers, allowing them to participate in the emerging economy. The new service is available to both retail and institutional customers of Interactive Brokers (U.K.) Limited (IBUK).
“Introducing cryptocurrency trading gives UK clients enhanced flexibility to invest across markets and asset classes while also adding exposure to digital assets,” said Gerald Perez, CEO of Interactive Brokers.
The company said that eligible customers of IBUK can seamlessly manage both their traditional securities and digital assets accounts opened at Paxos Trust Company through a single “unified platform”.
This means that users can access their crypto holdings together with other traditional assets such as stocks, derivatives, commodities, and foreign exchange products in one account through the unified platform.
The platform is designed to provide a comprehensive overview of users’ accounts, including their holdings and transaction history, without having to open numerous accounts on various platforms.
Low Commission Rates for British Customers
The company stated that British customers, including financial advisors, will enjoy low commission rates for digital asset trading on the unified platform.
The fee ranges from 0.12% to 0.18% of the trade value, with a minimum fee of USD 1.75 per order with no added spreads, markups, or custody fees.
The move aims to provide transparent and cost-effective trading options for users in the region.
On the Interactive Brokers platform, cryptocurrencies are priced in USD. This means that during trading, users will have to convert their GBP or other currencies to USD with tight spreads, ensuring efficient currency exchange.
However, when trading products denominated in a different currency than the one in the user’s account, users can incur potential conversion fees.
Meanwhile, Interactive Brokers Limited is regulated in the UK by the country’s market watchdog, the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA).
The company registered with the agency as a crypto assets firm in compliance with the Money Laundering, Terrorist Financing, and Transfer of Funds Acts of 2017.

UK cannabis millionaire’s legal ‘deals on wheels’ via crypto


            
Financial failure does not phase medical marijuana millionaire and entrepreneur Maximillian White. 



Europe’s wealthiest legal cannabis tycoon has seen misfortune quite a bit, twice in his own career and once in his father’s. However, his personal reaction when his business lost $29 million in the Cypriot banking collapse in 2012 was a little unusual.



Instead of eking out his remaining money, he blew it on buying a Rolls Royce that he drove about in public.



“I’m a proud man. I didn’t want people to think I was lost,” he says. “I may also be a poser.” In reality, he is a hard worker who isn’t afraid of failing.



Like many of his generation, White is now embracing blockchain — with a unique use case for NFTs — as part of his business.He says the whole is better than the sum of the parts, like a cocktail.




“For example, a Manhattan cocktail is a blended mix of whiskey, sweet vermouth and bitters. It’s the combination that makes it great. For me, it’s the combination of cannabis, blockchain and crypto – you can’t go wrong.”




Who is Maximillian White? 



White’s first career was in music production, including working on a track with Drake that resulted in the hit “One Dance.” He also built and sold a music streaming service called Beatport, which made him millions.



Maxmillian White (Jordan Bareham)



His love affair with Portugal saw him create a beach club called Blanco Beach, which was frequented by Rio Ferdinand and featured top performances from Tyga, Tory Lanez, Roger Sanchez, Rick Ross and French Montana. It has since closed.White also has ADHD, which he reckons allows him to have an eclectic taste in music, from classical to U.K. funk and hip hop.



He says he knew he was going to be a business builder while still in primary school. When asked to dress up as the man he was going to be, he did not arrive at his classroom as a fireman or a policeman. Instead, he opted to dress up like an entrepreneur, wearing a sheepskin jacket and carrying a classic cloth swag bag.



He attributes his work ethic to his early life, singing as a chorister in Durham Cathedral and never having a day off, including singing on Christmas Day. 



He made most of his fortune selling medicinal marijuana to wholesalers around the world and setting up Europe’s largest plantation in Portugal, a massive 40-hectare farm. He somehow managed to secure multiple government partnerships in territories previously untapped.



He expanded into property in Dubai, Majorca and Eastern Europe and says his interest was sparked by the loss of the family home as a child. His father lost everything, and they had to move to a council home. He has since experienced even greater personal tragedy in the full glare of the public eye when his brother died in a violent altercation at a Dubai nightclub in 2022.






Legal marijuana and crypto



Many people who grew up with restrictive marijuana laws may be uncomfortable with legalized weed, but in recent years, the laws around the world have become increasingly liberal.

Medical marijuana is now legal in more than 50 countries, and nine countries have legalized recreational marijuana use, including Canada, Germany, South Africa and Thailand. Ironically, despite the Netherlands’ reputation, weed is not strictly legal there, though it is tolerated.



Back in 2021, White told Ladbible about plans to develop a cannabis industry cryptocurrency called MEDI. That token never launched — he got caught up building his medical marijuana business instead — but three years on, he’s revised and revamped the plans into something new.



LadBible’s report on his previous crypto project. (Ladbible)



Aided by digital marketeer Ricardo Capone, an old friend now serving as his chief technology officer, White has teamed his cannabis product with NFTs to provide a traceability engine on the blockchain for his plants.



White says that when he first came across NFTs, he didn’t see them as valuable art pieces. Even though Beeple’s $69 million NFT sale dominated the news, White was not excited about artist sales or royalties.




“However, I instantly got smart contracts, that’s what excited me. I could see the future business use which would decrease the need for lawyers. People could buy cars or property using smart contracts, or you could sell a business with full transparency. Smart contracts made me delve further into the space.”




NFTs representing a business



However, White is not so sure about whether the term has a good reputation any more. Given he’s already selling recreational cannabis, he is slightly wary about doubling down by pairing it with the term “NFTs”.



Dr Green NFTs represent a share of a business (Dr Green)



“People lost a lot of money investing in NFTs, typically digital art, but the technology is what excites me. So, I think the onus is on us to educate people about this real-world asset, or digital asset, and what it can do. It’s not just about flipping art. 



“Again, I bring it back for business use,” he says, explaining how NFTs — which are unique tokens — can represent a fractional share of a real-world property. “For example, maybe people purchase properties today, using NFTs as a means of showing ownership. If you can’t afford the entire house, maybe you could buy a portion, and in the future, you could even sell that NFT, earn profit and put it into your next house.”



His latest crypto-related project is called Dr Green, with NFTs being used as part of the distribution business or what he calls “unique business passes for people.” A total of 5,145 unique NFTs provide holders with access to the Dr Green DApp so they can build a community to sell cannabis. There are also plans to release Platinum NFTs linked to cannabis-loving celebs who’ll create their own strains.



The DApp requires KYCing customers to ensure the product is only sold in regions where this is legal. Payments are taken in fiat or crypto, with the sellers’ markup paid out in Ethereum.DrGreen then ships the products out.



Maxmillian White and Ricardo Capone, the chief technology officer of Dr Green (Jordan Bareham)



Supply chain tracking of weed on blockchain



White says the blockchain traceability proves the quality of the product and says he spent millions investing in the “cannabis farm, processing plant and R&D facility.” 




“We have put significant money into developing one of the most sophisticated medical cannabis businesses. By putting our recreational business on the blockchain, we are using technology to track everything, ensure we are compliant with all laws, and it also allows us to function as a hub for distributed entrepreneurs.”




In short, the NFTs are a bit like a license to operate a business hooked into his distribution network and can be traded on to others if necessary. The value of the NFT rises based on how many customers it represents. Some will see this as a savvy business move blending technology and entrepreneurship, while others will no doubt see it as morally bankrupt and corrupting our youth. But times are changing.






“Our NFTs are acting like a digital key or real-world asset, where you can plug into the systems of a company that is already up and running.”



Interested, but still cautious about crypto



Despite his interest in blockchain, he is cautious about the hype around cryptocurrencies as a financial instrument and believes there is an inherent flaw in the way cryptocurrencies are valued against the dollar. 



“If the price of crypto is always going to be valued in real-world money, then how can it be decentralized? The dollar will never be decentralized, and I think that is a dangerous precedent.”

Solana Game 'Nyan Heroes' Reveals Token Launch Amid Play-to-Airdrop Push - Decrypt

Cat-themed shooter Nyan Heroes has confirmed that it will launch its NYAN token on the Solana blockchain next week.The Overwatch and Titanfall inspired mech shooter has been in pre-alpha since March, reportedly breaking into the top 30 titles on the Epic Games Store with over 200,000 downloads.On Tuesday, May 21, the official Nyan Heroes token NYAN will be launched on the centralized exchange Bybit. In addition to this launch, the announcement hints that details regarding the long-awaited NYAN airdrop are coming soon.NYAN tokens will be airdropped to players who participated in the game’s play-to-airdrop campaigns. Players are able to earn MEOW and CATNIP points by playing the game or engaging on social media, and these points will earn players an allocation of NYAN once the token has launched. It appears with the announcement that NYAN is coming next week, details on how to claim this airdrop are also just around the corner.Developed by Singapore-based game studio 9 Lives Interactive, the game received $3 million in funding to support the launch of the game. This led to a successful pre-alpha launch on the Epic Games Store, bringing in over 100,000 players in its first week and a half.Currently the game has no NFT integration as the developers are focusing on gameplay first. For this reason, the game can be played entirely without touching crypto or even having a wallet. Even with the token launch, this is going to stay the same.9 Lives Interactive Creative Director and CEO Max Fu told Decrypt that there will be an in-game premium currency for purchasing “Web2” items. There will also be special items marked as “awakened” that are tokenized and can be traded, but engaging with the crypto side of the game is completely optional.Edited by Andrew HaywardGG NewsletterGet the latest web3 gaming news, hear directly from gaming studios and influencers covering the space, and receive power-ups from our partners.

Minneapolis Fed President Neel Kashkari Makes Critical Bitcoin (BTC) and Economic Statements - Bitcoin Sistemi


Minneapolis FED President Neel Kashkari shared his views on various aspects of the US economy in a recent statement. Kashkari said the FED is focusing on underlying demand in the economy to control inflation.
Kashkari expressed surprise at the resistance of American consumers and said, “Americans are spending more than I expected.” Kashkari also noted the robustness of the housing market, which exceeded his expectations.


The FED's current policy stance has also been a matter of debate. “The biggest question mark right now is how restrictive the policy is now,” Kashkari asked, suggesting that it may be necessary to maintain the current stance for a while to determine the future direction of inflation.

Kashkari also touched on the issue of US government debt. With rising debt, higher borrowing costs may be needed in the near term to meet the 2% inflation target, he said.





Regarding cryptocurrencies, Kashkari reiterated his skepticism about Bitcoin. “Bitcoin has very few practical uses, it is not an investment instrument or currency,” he said. He also reiterated his doubts about the value of Central Bank Digital Currencies (CBDCs).

Sam Altman's Worldcoin project is taking a tumble.
                        Worldcoin ($WLD), the blockchain project helmed by OpenAI’s Sam Altman, has fallen nearly 20% in the last two weeks and 6.4% overnight despite other leading cryptocurrencies posting green candles.The WLD token currently trades for $4.83.That’s 59% short of its all-time high (ATH) of $11.74, posted on March 10 this year just as the entire market was rallying in line with Bitcoin, which posted its own ATH of $73,737.94 four days later.Since then, fortune hasn’t favored Worldcoin. The token tumbled down to lows of $4, where it has found consistent support but it has faced strong resistance on the way to the $7 mark.WLD’s Relative Strength Index (RSI) is 37 which indicates some recent selling has contributed to the downturn.In the short-term, there is still some space for further losses, but the bulk of the downward price pressure should be relieved by tomorrow.OpenAI’s Worldcoin: Will $WLD Bank The Unbanked?
Worldcoin was a controversial launch last year due to its premise: anyone wanting some $WLD has to visit a biometric eyeball scanner called the ”Orb” and submit a snapshot of their eyeballs.They’re found in Berlin, Dubai, London, Mexico City, Miami, New York City, San Francisco, Seoul, and Tokyo.This data is then used alongside verification of government-issued ID to confirm a user’s personhood before distributing coins to them.OpenAI says Worldcoin is building blockchain infrastructure to bank the world’s unbanked, enabling everyone “to broadly share the coming technological prosperity ” according to its website. “Privacy first. Owned by everyone.” reads the slogan.But many are skeptical, including Ethereum creator Vitalik Buterin who wrote a blog post listing his concerns of the protocol’s privacy, accessibility, centralization and security and said it could take years for it to work.Lawmakers around the world are also monitoring the protocol, with press reports suggesting authorities in Mexico, Malaysia and Argentina have all aired similar concerns recently.This year the project hit a new high back in January when it welcomed 16,000 Orb signups in a single day after surpassing the 5 million mark the preceding month.From Eyeballs to Wieners, New AI Meme Coin WienerAI Raises $1.9 Million in ICO.
The recent volatility of Worldcoin’s $WLD reflects a token that consumers are still unsure about. Sure, Worldcoin has an intriguing premise, but in a world of constant data breaches, biometric information can seem like to0 high a price to pay to get crypto.Thankfully, a new generation of meme coins is cropping up which brings bundles of non-invasive utility along with some laughs to boot.Leading this new generation of coins are projects like the blockchain security guard dog Scotty the AI, which raised $10 million at presale, and crypto’s trading companion WienerAI, an enticing new presale that has already lapped up $2 million in a month.$WAI is a brand new meme token and AI companion that may yield potentially eye-watering rallies once word gets out about its core offering.Touted as a “Revolutionary AI Trading partner”, WienerAI ($WAI) is a digital companion that gives its owners user-friendly AI-enhanced trading advice, seamless swap functionality and zero fees.Around 20% of $WAI’s supply is for staking.WienerAI’s website offers buyers the ability to stake during the presale, in order to take advantage of the lucrative yield, which is currently 525% APY.Furthermore, WienerAI is transparent.

                        Chinese police in Sichuan province apprehended some suspects of an underground banking scheme on May 15 for allegedly facilitating illicit foreign exchange transactions involving about $2 billion worth of Tether’s USDT.According to a report from Baijiahao.baidu, the Sichuan police arrested the suspects for allegedly using USDT to evade national foreign exchange supervision while providing illegal settlement channels.Tether’s USDT Used to Evade National Foreign Exchange Supervision
The operation resulted in the shutdown of a major underground banking scheme involved in smuggling operations worth 13.8 billion Chinese yuan, equivalent to about $1.9 billion. USDT was revealed to have been the conduit for the illicit transactions.The scheme spanned 26 provinces across China, including municipalities and autonomous regions. The police arrested over 90 suspects associated with the scheme.Stablecoins like USDT are often exploited to bypass foreign exchange supervision due to their price stability and anonymity of cryptocurrency, making them suitable for storing and transferring funds without the risk of price fluctuations.This latest arrest of suspects using illicit foreign exchange transactions follows a similar event in the arrest of Cartier’s heir, Maximilien de Hoop Cartier, by the US Department of Justice (DoJ).The DoJ’s indictment revealed that Hoop Cartier allegedly collaborated with a Colombian drug cartel to import 100 kilos of cocaine and laundered hundreds of millions of dollars, primarily through over-the-counter (OTC) USDT stablecoin trades.Is The Regulation of Tether’s USDT Imminent?
This is not the first time malicious entities have been linked to using USDT to launder money.A United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime report highlighted the USDT as a key tool used by money launderers and fraudsters.Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse further fueled speculation by suggesting that the US government is targeting Tether in an interview on the World Class podcast.VIDEOGarlinghouse admitted uncertainty about the company’s potential regulatory fallout, however, despite its big influence in the cryptocurrency market.These comments elicited a strong response from Tether CEO Paolo Ardoino, who fired back at Garlinghouse, labeling him an “uninformed CEO” and highlighting Tether’s proactive collaboration with global law enforcement agencies to combat illicit activities.Ardoino said that Tether has partnered with 24 agencies in over 40 countries, successfully blocking wallets in response to 198 requests in the last year and 339 requests in the last three years.Despite these developments, the US government’s anticipated regulatory scrutiny of Tether may be unfounded.Earlier this week, on May 14, Tether froze $5.2 million worth of USDT due to its association with phishing scams. Additionally, Tether has partnered with Chainalysis to develop monitoring and analysis tools to identify wallets associated with illicit or sanctioned addresses.

$1 Billion Bitcoin Leaves Coinbase: Who Is Buying?


								On-chain data shows the Coinbase exchange has just seen a massive Bitcoin outflow, a sign that some large-scale buying might be going on.
Over 16,000 BTC Left The Coinbase Platform In The Past Day
As pointed out by an analyst in a CryptoQuant Quicktake post, Coinbase has observed a huge outflow for the seventh time this year. The on-chain metric of interest here is the “exchange outflow,” which keeps track of the total amount of Bitcoin leaving the wallets attached to a centralized exchange.
When the value of this metric is high, it means that the investors are currently withdrawing large amounts from the platform in question. Generally, holders take their coins out of the custody of these central entities whenever they plan to hold onto them for extended periods.

Additionally, the trend can also be a sign that these coins coming out are fresh buys, so exchange outflows can have an overall bullish effect on the cryptocurrency’s price.
On the other hand, the indicator having a low value may imply that there isn’t much interest in buying the asset right now. Depending on the trend in the opposite metric, the exchange inflow, such a value may either be bearish or neutral for the coin.
Now, here is a chart that shows the trend in the Bitcoin exchange outflow specifically for the Coinbase Advanced platform:

The value of the metric seems to have been quite high recently | Source: CryptoQuant
As displayed in the above graph, the Bitcoin exchange outflow for Coinbase has registered a huge spike in the past day. In total, 16,021 BTC, worth nearly a billion US dollars at the current exchange rate, has left the platform with this outflow. Given the massive scale, a large entity has to be involved here.
Coinbase, in particular, is known to be the preferred exchange for American institutional investors, so this accumulation may have come from one such trader. A more zoomed out view of the chart of the same indicator shows this certainly isn’t the first time such a withdrawal has occurred on the platform.

Looks like the metric has registered several spikes over the past few months | Source: CryptoQuant
As the quant has highlighted in the graph, Coinbase has seen Bitcoin outflows of similar scale seven times in the year 2024 so far. Some of these buys preceded surges in the price, so it’s possible they were at least partially the instigator for them.
However, the more recent spikes have failed to produce any bullish effects on the cryptocurrency, so it’s hard to say whether the latest outflow would lead to any rally at all.

“There is a high probability that this transaction is a institutional purchase,” the analyst notes. “But on the flip side, it could also be an internal transfer by Coinbase.”
Naturally, if the latter is the reason for this apparent outflow, then the transaction wouldn’t really be relevant for the market.
Bitcoin Price
Bitcoin has seen a small jump of 1% over the past 24 hours that has taken its price back to $62,400.

Ethereum Bull Flag Breakout: ATH On The Horizon As Major Metrics Turn Bullish


																Crypto analyst Javon Marks has highlighted several metrics that have turned bullish for Ethereum (ETH). The analyst noted that one of these metrics suggests an all-time high (ATH) for the second-largest crypto token. 
Bullish Metrics For Ethereum
Marks remarked in an X (formerly Twitter) post that the bull flag-like price structure has formed on the Ethereum chart. He added that higher lows are forming in Ethereum’s price action, which is also a bullish signal as it suggests a strong resistance to downward trends. Meanwhile, the analyst claims lower lows in the Relative Strength Index (RSI) indicate a hidden bullish divergence with Ethereum’s price.

Marks then raised the possibility of Ethereum hitting a new ATH, stating that the “bull flag breakout might lead into new all-time highs and be of major service in many Altcoin progressions.” Before then, he claimed that Ethereum could soon experience a larger price breakout, making the crypto token experience a 63% upside to $4,811.
Crypto analyst Michaël van de Poppe also recently suggested that Ethereum could make a major move soon enough and lead altcoins to make new highs. According to him, this will be triggered by the news surrounding the Ethereum ETF, as he expects that to be the “rotation for the Altcoins.”

However, Ethereum also risks experiencing a significant decline, considering reports that the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) might reject the Ethereum ETF applications. Crypto analyst James Van Straten stated that a rejection of the Spot ETF “sends the ETHBTC ratio lower 0.047 to 0.03 as a long-term projection.”
This was one of the reasons why the analyst stated that “Ethereum looks like it’s going to the grave.” He also alluded to the fact that ETH has become inflationary with the Decun upgrade reducing transaction fees, which has ultimately reduced ETH’s burn rate.

Things Aren’t Looking Good For ETH
Crypto analyst Derek recently mentioned that “Ethereum dominance and recent performance are heading toward their worst ever.” He noted that attention has turned to Bitcoin due to the reports about a potential rejection of the Ethereum ETF and securities status, which has put pressure on investment sentiment. According to him, this has caused the “imbalance in dominance” to reach its worst point.

Derek further noted that Ethereum’s unimpressive price action is affecting other altcoins, as their prices are “depressed.” He also claimed that the prices of layer two coins “continued to be under pressure.” The analyst suggested that things could get worse, as the ETH/BTC chart shows a downward wedge pattern in progress. He claims that altcoins can only “breathe” if Ethereum can escape this pattern quickly.
At the time of writing, Ethereum is trading at around $2906, down in the last 24 hours according to data from CoinMarketCap.

Robinhood rolls out SOL staking to European markets

Trading platform Robinhood is targeting European users to expand its crypto services as legal challenges loom in the United States. On May 15, the company announced its first crypto-staking product, exclusively for European customers.According to an announcement, Robinhood customers can now stake Solana (SOL) and receive a 5% yield through the app. Competitors offering SOL staking, including Kraken and Binance, advertise yields of up to 5% and 8%, respectively.Stakers receive passive rewards from their holdings in exchange for supporting the network. When staking, users lock up their tokens to validate transactions and secure the network operations. Rewards from staking can change over time due to several factors, such as network inflation, the amount of SOL staked, validators’ commission rates, and market conditions. Along with SOL staking, the company introduced local-language versions of its crypto services for users in Italy, Poland and Lithuania, along with educational content focusing on Bitcoin (BTC), USD Coin (USDC), and Avalanche (AVAX). “Our customers in Europe have told us loud and clear that they want an app that provides local language support and products that help them earn additional passive income,” said Johann Kerbrat, general manager of Robinhood Crypto.Source: SolanaRobinhood has seen a surge in crypto trading activity in the first quarter of 2024. The firm posted a 224% increase in crypto trading volumes to $36 billion. Approximately 40% of its transaction-based revenue was generated by crypto-related services, resulting in the firm’s second straight profitable quarter with a $157 million net income.Despite the growing market demand, Robinhood’s crypto business still faces many challenges. On May 6, the company received a Wells notice from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), indicating an incoming enforcement action against its crypto arm. According to the filing, the SEC investigated Robinhood’s cryptocurrency listings and crypto custodian operations for alleged securities violations. As a precaution against possible securities violations, the company does not offer stake services in the United States, nor does it list some crypto tokens or provide lending services.Magazine: What do crypto market makers actually do?

CFTC Warns Public of ‘Money Mule’ Scams Involving Crypto Disguised As Work-From-Home Opportunities - The Daily Hodl


								Students and job seekers should be wary of a specific type of crypto scam falsely promising work-from-home opportunities, warns the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC).
“Money mule” scams involve criminals tricking people into sending and receiving money into their bank accounts, digital wallets, or spot-market crypto trading accounts as part of their supposed job responsibilities.










Melanie Devoe, director of the CFTC’s Office of Customer Education and Outreach (OCEO), warns that even unwitting participants in money laundering can be charged criminally.
“Young people looking for summer jobs may be just looking for part-time income and could be attracted to offers that require being online a few hours a day. Unfortunately, they could become unwitting accomplices to money laundering or what the criminals call ‘money mules,’ and that association could land them in jail.”
The CFTC notes that victims might be directed to use Bitcoin (BTC) kiosks or other on-ramps to move cash into digital assets on a blockchain. They might also receive a large payment to a single crypto wallet and then be directed to split that payment and send it in smaller portions to a list of other addresses.
The regulator also warns the public to look out for “pig butchering” romance scams.
In a pig butchering scam, bad actors form a relationship with a victim online to gain their trust and convince the victim to invest in cryptocurrency platforms that the scammers control. Once the victim has invested a significant amount of money, the con artist disappears with the funds.
The fraudsters refer to their victims as “pigs” because they use elaborate storylines to “fatten up” the victim into believing they are in a close relationship.

Bitcoin Price Pumps 5% to $65K As CPI Data – Can BTC Break Out of Its Current Range? / Source: Cryptonews
                        The Bitcoin (BTC) price surged more than 5% back to the $65,000 level on Wednesday in wake of US CPI inflation data that showed moderating price pressures in April, supporting bets that the Fed will be able to ease interest rates a few times before the end of 2024.The rise in the Bitcoin price came alongside a 0.9% jump to new all-time highs for the S&P 500.Meanwhile, US bond yields and the US Dollar Index slumped to one-month lows.Traders are currently the most confident that there will be at least one cut by September in around one month.That’s according to CME data, which shows a 71% money market implied probability of at least one cut by September.One day ago, the money market implied probability of at least one cut by September was around 65%.Bitcoin now faces a crucial technical barrier in the form of its 50DMA at $65,166.If the Bitcoin price can break above here and its May highs around $65,500, further short-term upside could follow.The next level to watch would be the late-April highs around $67,000.Beyond that, a retest of yearly highs in the $73,000 area would be the next target.The Bitcoin price could soon surge back to yearly highs if it can break above these key levels. Source: TradingViewCan the Bitcoin Price Break Out of Its Multi-Month Range?
Fears about a gradual rise in inflation in Q1 2024 has been a major headwind to Bitcoin in recent months.Sticky inflation at the start of 2024 forced markets to price out aggressive Fed rate cuts.That’s probably the single biggest reason why Bitcoin stalled after hitting new record highs near $74,000 ahead of the halving.It has since been locked within a consolidation range, trading mostly between $60,000 and $70,000.But the latest inflation report, while not a game-changer itself, shows signs the Q1 inflation bump won’t last.If concerns about inflation are set to ease from here on out, macro could be about to flip to a medium-term tailwind for Bitcoin, rather than being a headwind.So can the Bitcoin price break out of its multi-month range?Well, in recent years, May hasn’t been a good month for Bitcoin.As per bitcoinmonthlyreturn.com, Bitcoin fell 35% in 2021, 15.5% in 2022 and 7% in 2023.As per Steno Research, over the past 5 years, Bitcoin hasn’t performed well during the middle months of the year.And post-halving rallies don’t typically get going until 4-6 months after the halving. That would suggest no major push higher until after August.But 2024 could be different as it’s an election year.Markets tend to rally into elections, breaking them out of their normal bearish summer conditions.Long-term Bitcoin price risks remain strongly tilted to the upside.Rate cuts, the halving, continued government spending and demand for spot Bitcoin ETFs could vault BTC above $100,000 in 2024 or 2025.

Two brothers manipulated Ethereum protocols to steal $25M - Justice Dept

Authorities with the United States Department of Justice have unsealed an indictment alleging that two individuals stole $25 million in cryptocurrency in a scheme that “exploit[ed] the very integrity of the Ethereum blockchain.”In a May 15 notice, the Justice Department charged brothers Anton Peraire-Bueno and James Pepaire-Bueno with conspiracy to commit wire fraud, wire fraud, and conspiracy to commit money laundering. According to U.S. officials, the brothers fraudulently obtained $25 million worth of crypto “within approximately 12 seconds” using a scheme that “calls the very integrity of the blockchain into question.”“These brothers allegedly committed a first-of-its-kind manipulation of the Ethereum blockchain by fraudulently gaining access to pending transactions, altering the movement of the electronic currency, and ultimately stealing $25 million in cryptocurrency from their victims,” said Thomas Fattorusso, a special agent with the IRS Criminal Investigation’s New York Field Office.U.S. authorities said the brothers rejected requests to return the stolen funds and hid the assets using shell companies and foreign crypto exchanges, transferring them to several wallets. They could face up to 20 years in prison for each count if convicted.This is a developing story, and further information will be added as it becomes available.

Circle to move legal headquarters to U.S. ahead of IPO | Cryptopolitan

Circle, a key player in the stablecoin market, is packing up its legal base in Ireland and heading to the United States, eyeing a major step forward with its upcoming IPO.The decision, officially lodged in court documents, aims to plant Circle’s corporate roots deeper into U.S. soil, getting ready for a public offering that could shake up the crypto and traditional finance industry alike.Circle’s transition is targeted at U.S. investorsReports confirmed that Circle indeed has intentions to make the U.S. its new legal domicile, a change brought on as the company prepares to list its shares publicly.This transition isn’t just about geography, though. It is a strategic alignment to leverage the strong U.S. market framework and Wall Street as it steps into the IPO spotlight.Despite the excitement, a spokesperson kept the cards close to the chest, offering no specific reasons for this strategic decision.January was when Circle had its formal engagement with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) that revealed its serious IPO intentions.Circle has been recovering and expandingThe crypto market has been relatively favorable lately, with $USDC, Circle’s flagship $33 billion stablecoin, regaining its stride.From a dip to $24 billion market cap earlier in the year, $USDC has seen a notable market recovery, thanks in part to the general crypto market’s rally and high expectations of a bull run.This rebound is particularly impressive considering last year’s crises, which saw $USDC’s reserves hit hard by the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank.But Circle isn’t in this alone. Heavy hitters like Goldman Sachs, BlackRock, and Fidelity back it, not to mention crypto-centric giants like Coinbase.Speaking of Coinbase, Anthony Bassili, head of tokenization there, recently highlighted their deep involvement with over $28 billion of assets in Circle, emphasizing their capability to also mint $USDC.Coinbase is betting big on expanding $USDC’s utility across its Base platform, aiming to set a precedent for others in the industry.The platform’s infrastructure, including the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) and integration of $USDC, promises enhanced security and broader adoption.Giving users the opportunity to trade diverse assets directly, without converting them to dollars, is one of their missions, according to Bassili.However, he notes that big developments in regulatory frameworks and product design are necessary to realize these goals.Since its launch, Coinbase’s Base, an Ethereum layer-2 chain, has not only doubled Ethereum’s transaction volume but also attracted an explosion in developer interest, boasting an 800% increase in activity.This surge has contributed massively to Circle’s 30% market capitalization boost in the first quarter of 2024 alone, paralleling a 15% rise in stablecoin revenue as part of Coinbase’s overall revenue increase by a third.

DOJ charges 2 brothers tied to $25M attack on MEV bots last year - Blockworks


Two brothers accused of orchestrating an attack last year on Ethereum trading bots have been indicted by the US government. 
The Department of Justice unsealed charges against Anton Peraire-Bueno and James Peraire-Bueno on Wednesday.
The pair are charged with conspiracy to commit wire fraud, wire fraud, and conspiracy to commit money laundering after the brothers allegedly tried to “exploit the very integrity of the Ethereum blockchain to fraudulently obtain approximately $25 million worth of cryptocurrency within approximately 12 seconds.”
Both were arrested on Tuesday and will face judges in Massachusetts and New York. 
The April 2023 exploit targeted bots that seek profit by essentially trying to front-run transactions on the network. Maximum extractable value, or MEV, referring to the maximum value that can be obtained during transaction block production beyond rewards and fees.

The Peraire-Bueno brothers sought to “lure” MEV bots from the traders they allegedly targeted by “proposing at least eight specific transactions that…the defendants knew would cause the” targeted bots to include the lure transactions in the bundles, the indictment said. The exploit took advantage of a since-patched code vulnerability in the MEV-Boost software. 
“In each of these eight bundles, the victim traders effectively bought substantial amounts of particularly illiquid cryptocurrencies…for approximately $25 million of various stablecoins.” 
“Through the Exploit, which is believed to be the very first of its kind, Anton Peraire-Bueno and James Pepaire-Bueno manipulated and tampered with the process and protocols by which transactions are validated and added to the Ethereum blockchain. In doing so, they fraudulently gained access to pending private transactions and used that access to alter certain transactions and obtain their victims’ cryptocurrency,” a DOJ press release said. 
To avoid detection, the two tried to conceal their identities through shell companies and private crypto addresses. 
Following the attack, the brothers even “transferred the stolen cryptocurrency through a series of transactions designed to conceal the source and ownership of the stolen funds.”
They researched know-your-customer (KYC) procedures online, per the indictment, to learn the KYC standards and extradition procedures. They allegedly also researched the crimes they’d end up being charged with.
“As alleged in today’s indictment, the Peraire-Bueno brothers stole $25 million in Ethereum cryptocurrency through a technologically sophisticated, cutting-edge scheme they plotted for months and executed in seconds,” said Deputy Attorney General Lisa Monaco.

Why ‘multimodal' AI is taking over tech products

OpenAI and Google showcased their latest and greatest AI technology this week. For the last two years, tech companies have raced to make AI models smarter, but now a new focus has emerged: make them multimodal. OpenAI and Google are zeroing in on AI that can seamlessly switch between its robotic mouth, eyes, and ears.Why Nvidia needs to deliver on Q1 earnings“Multimodal” is the biggest buzzword as tech companies place bets on the most enticing form of their AI models in your everyday life. AI chatbots have lost their luster since ChatGPT’s launch in 2022. So companies are hoping that talking to and visually sharing things with an AI assistant feels more natural than typing. When you see multimodal AI done well, it feels like science fiction come to life.On Monday, OpenAI showed off GPT-4 Omni, which was oddly reminiscent of the dystopian movie about lost human connection Her. Omni stands for “omnichannel,” and OpenAI touted the model’s ability to process video alongside audio. The demo showed ChatGPT looking at a math problem through a phone camera, as an OpenAI staff member verbally asked the chatbot to walk them through it. OpenAI says it’s rolling out now to Premium users.The next day, Google unveiled Project Astra, which promised to do roughly the same thing. Gizmodo’s Florence Ion used multimodal AI to identify what faux flowers she was looking at, which it correctly identified as tulips. However, Project Astra seemed a little slower than GPT-4o, and the voice was far more robotic. More Siri than Her, but I’ll let you decide whether that’s a good thing. Google says this is in the early stages, however, and even notes some current challenges that OpenAI has overcome.“While we’ve made incredible progress developing AI systems that can understand multimodal information, getting response time down to something conversational is a difficult engineering challenge,” said Google in a blog post.Now you might remember Google’s Gemini demo video from Dec. 2023 that turned out to be highly manipulated. Six months later, Google still isn’t ready to release what it showed in that video, but OpenAI is speeding ahead with GPT-4o. Multimodal AI represents the next big race in AI development, and OpenAI seems to be winning.A key difference maker for GPT-4o is that the single AI model can natively process audio, video, and text. Previously, OpenAI needed separate AI models to translate speech and video into text so that the underlying GPT-4, which is language-based, could understand these different mediums. It seems like Google may still be using multiple AI models to perform these tasks, given the slower response times.We’ve also seen a wider adoption of AI wearables as tech companies embrace multimodal AI. The Humane AI Pin, Rabbit R1, and Meta Ray-Bans are all examples of AI-enabled devices that utilize these various mediums. These devices promise to make us less dependent on smartphones, though it’s possible that Siri and Google Assistant will also be empowered with multimodal AI soon enough.Multimodal AI is likely something you’ll hear a lot more about in the months and years to come. Its development and integration into products could make AI significantly more useful. The technology ultimately takes the weight off of you to transcribe the world to an LLM and allows the AI to “see” and “hear” the world for itself.This story originally appeared on Gizmodo.

Black Donald Trump Rallies 600% Before Consolidating, While Shiba Inu and Dogecoin Lag



                    

Black Donald Trump (BLATRUMP) could become a viral memecoin, like Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE).



Black Donald Trump (BLATRUMP), a Solana memecoin that was launched yesterday, is aiming to challenge other memecoin giants, such as Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE).




Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Black Donald Trump presents a similar opportunity.



BLATRUMP rallied over 600% in the first few hours after its launch, before consolidating as some early buyers cashed out their profits.



However, most investors are still holding their tokens, as they are waiting for BLATRUMP to be listed on ByBit later this week, as this listing will cause the coin’s price to skyrocket.




Its current price presents a great opportunity for new investors to buy the dip before the next rally. 



BLATRUMP has a market cap below $30,000 at the moment, meaning that when it just reaches a modest market cap of around $500,000-$1,000,000, early investors would generate returns of 2,000%-3,000% in a matter of days or hours. 



The exciting memecoin is poised to rally another 12,000% in the coming two days, and Black Donald Trump (BLATRUMP) could potentially reach a multi-million dollar market cap within a few weeks.



Currently, BLATRUMP can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jupiter and Raydium, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days.




To buy Black Donald Trump (BLATRUMP) on these platforms, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for BLATRUMP by entering its contract address – 29BiHVTBEo7RnbtwqwTmV3Hy6nDTadcCgopM6HUyjGRK –  in the receiving field.



In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price.



If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner.



The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum.



This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like BLATRUMP.

Binance's New Trading Bot Enables Everyone to Do Arbitrage - DailyCoin


        

Binance launches several new trading options for beginners. 



One is the Funding Rate Arbitrage Bot for automated trading.



Spot copy trading also became available to all eligible users. 




The crypto trading landscape is transforming with the increasing adoption of automated trading tools and bots. When done right, these tools make more sophisticated trading strategies accessible to regular traders, which is why they are popular.  



After several other exchanges introduced these tools, Binance, the world’s largest exchange, is joining the trend. Most recently, the exchange launched its new Funding Rate Arbitrage Bot. Moreover, Binance also rolled out its Spot Copy Trading feature to all eligible users, making trading more accessible.  



Binance Launches Arbitrage Bot and Expands Spot Copy Trading



On Wednesday, May 15, Binance introduced the Funding Rate Arbitrage Bot, an automated tool for spot and futures arbitrage strategies. This bot allows users to earn funding fees by automating the opening of a perpetual futures position and simultaneously hedging it with an opposite position in the spot market.




The hedging makes the strategy less risky than just investing in futures. While traders could execute this strategy manually, it requires significant work and expertise. The bot effectively cuts out that work, enabling regular traders to execute this strategy. 



According to Rohit Wad, Chief Technology Officer of Binance, the feature’s introduction was a result of user feedback. He highlighted the Spot Copy Trading feature’s positive reception, which has attracted over 700 Lead Traders since its initial launch.



Bots, Copy Trading Make Crypto More Accessible



The Funding Rate Arbitrage Bot is just one of many bots on the Binance bot marketplace. Currently, the company states that there are more than 120,000 strategies for automated trading for players to choose from. This aligns with a broader trend towards automated trading in crypto. 




Binance has also expanded its spot copy trading platform to fit this trend. Initially launched for select traders in late April 2024, the feature is now fully available to all eligible users as of Wednesday, May 15. 



Binance boasts that since its launch, over 70% of active Lead Traders on its copy trading have achieved positive P&L. This is even though the overall crypto market cap fell by 11% in April. With both bots and copy trading features, Binance aims to enable all traders to benefit from advanced trading strategies. 



On the Flipside




While automating trading strategies offers significant advantages, it is not without risks. To use these tools effectively, traders must understand their parameters and limitations.



Copying successful traders does not guarantee profits, as market conditions can change rapidly. At the same time, copy traders do not receive the same profits as traders they are copying.  




Why This Matters



The introduction of automated trading tools democratizes access to complex trading strategies. By simplifying trading, Binance enables a broader base to participate in the crypto market.

Is Starbucks (SBUX) a Buying Opportunity After Earnings or a Stock in Decline - Tokenist


					
Neither the author, Tim Fries, nor this website, The Tokenist, provide financial advice. Please consult our website policy prior to making financial decisions.



Since the start of the year, Starbucks (NASDAQ: SBUX) has lost $23.2 billion in market value. The coffeehouse chain’s stock suffered a particularly steep drop on April 30th after the release of Q2 2024 earnings. 



This period contributed most to Starbucks’s value drain, accounting for a $14.3 billion reduction in market cap. With a year-to-date performance of negative 19%, would that make Starbucks stock an opportunity or a precursor to greater losses?



But before looking at the broader landscape in which Starbucks operates, what did the earnings report say?



Starbucks’ Downturn in Sales



Ending March 31st, 2024, Starbucks reported a 4% decline in global comparable store sales. Consolidated net revenue dropped to $8.6 billion, a 2% decrease from the year-ago quarter. Starbucks chief financial officer Rachel Ruggeri attributes this to a “complex and dynamic environment.”



In North America alone, operating income dropped 6% year-over-year to $1.1 billion, while overall net earnings decreased to $772.4 million from $908.3 million in Q2 2023. It also bears noting that Starbucks spent more than double on stock buybacks from that quarter, at $1.26 billion vs $479.3 million, respectively.



This figure aligns with the cash dividends paid of $1.29 billion. As we’ve seen with the recent record-breaking Apple example, once-controversial stock buybacks are a common tactic to retain investor confidence. 



When it comes to forecast expectations, Q2 was Starbucks’ second consecutive quarter, since beating estimates in Q3 ’23, to fail earnings per share consensus. And at a surprise of -13.92% ($0.68 reported vs $0.79 forecasted), it was a much greater failure than the one in Q4 ‘23 of -2.17%.





Are Starbucks Fundamentals Sound?



As a service provider, Starbucks is on the lower end of people’s priorities for needs. Considering this, the company relies on branding and in-store experience to leverage social capital, similar to Apple.



In other words, people who don’t care for Starbucks’ in-store experience would be much better off going to Costco with its frequent discounts to boot. This is why Costco (NASDAQ: COST) was recommended in January, with its stock price increasing from $657 to $787 per share since then.



During that same period, SBUX shares dropped from $93 to $75 per share. Inflation pressures have made people more mindful of their spending habits. The San Francisco Federal Reserve recently reported a complete depletion of cumulative pandemic-era excess savings.



At their peak in August 2021, they accounted for $2.1 trillion, having since drained to negative $72 billion by March 2024. Moreover, it is still unclear if the US hasn’t unofficially entered a recession. So far, updated mid-April, the Conference Board Leading Economic Index (LEI) is pointing toward a recovery.



While the growth is still negative year-over-year (YoY), it appears that recession has been avoided. Image credit: The Conference Board


However, coming into the election season, economic data should be taken with a grain of salt. After all, even the Fed Governor Christopher Waller complained that frequent economic data revisions make it difficult to deliver informed monetary policy decisions. 







What About Starbucks’ Flexibility?



Given the uncertainty of the “complex operating environment” mentioned in Starbucks’s earnings report, is it amenable to changing course?



Regarding pricing, it appears that it is off the coffee table. The company has been offloading inflation to its customers by increasing product prices, not lowering them. Moreover, Starbucks has to comply with mandatory minimum wage increases, which occasionally pop up across states.



This puts additional pressure on retailers to increase prices, which in turn increases customers’ pressure to ditch the brand. In contrast, utility companies that everyone needs can afford to tweak their pricing schemes accordingly. Investors should ask themselves if Starbucks has the capacity for that kind of flexibility.



To counter these pressures, Starbucks is focusing on boosting the attraction of Rewards memberships. In February, the company linked accounts with Bank of America for 2% cashback. However, even former Starbucks CEO Howard Schultz is warning that this may not be enough. 



In a LinkedIn post, he noted there are no quick fixes. In particular, “the stores require a maniacal focus on the customer experience, through the eyes of a merchant. The answer does not lie in data, but in the stores.”



While the macro environment remains unpredictable, Starbucks forecasted to “return $20 billion to shareholders by the end of fiscal 2025” via dividends and stock buybacks. At the same time, this trend has been heading against the ongoing unionization of the Starbucks workforce. That this represents a clear threat to the company’s bottom line was acknowledged in the November 2021 filing. 




“…labor costs, including wages and benefits, which, in a retail business such as ours, are two of our most significant costs,”




While fast-food chains are steadily rolling out automated kiosks to cut costs, Starbucks has yet to shift in this direction, which would erode its very branding.




“…our labor costs could increase and our business could be negatively affected by other requirements and expectations that could increase our costs,”




Where Does Analyst Forecasting Stand on SBUX Stock?



At the present price level of $75.63, SBUX shares are very close to their 52-week low of $71.80 per share. For the last 52 weeks, the average SBUX price has been holding at $95. According to analyst forecasting pulled by Nasdaq, this is a buy-on weakness opportunity.



The lowest estimate is aligned with the present price at $75, while the average SBUX price target is $88.48 per share. WSJ’s estimate is even more optimistic, with a low target of $77, while the average target is $87.90 per share. 



It remains to be seen if Starbucks brand loyalty will materialize these targets, aided by further stock buybacks.

Buy signal? XRP whales stack $55 million in two weeks


XRP whales embraced the opportunity to accumulate more tokens as the cryptocurrency market experiences a mostly neutral sentiment. Traders wonder whether this is a buy signal for the token amid developments related to Ripple, XRP’s largest holder.
In particular, the well-known trader and on-chain analyst Ali Martinez posted Santiment‘s data on X on May 15. Martinez highlighted a notable accumulation from whale addresses with a balance between 1 million and 10 million in the past 15 days.
These XRP whales have increased their total stash by 110 million XRP, from 3.60 billion to 3.72 billion. Notably, this investor’s category has been accumulating more tokens in an uptrend since March, making higher lows and higher highs.


Moreover, today’s data shows a yearly high for the amount of XRP supply in the hands of ‘1M-10M’ whales. This also indicates a bullish divergence, considering the price has been dropping ever since—in the opposite direction.

XRP social volume as whales accumulate
Looking for further insights, Finbold retrieved data from Santiment’s data, crossing XRP’s social volume with whale accumulation.
Interestingly, social interest and mentions for the token have been falling since a peak in March. This is another indicator of a social divergence, where whales seem bullish while the crowd has lost interest.
Usually, this asymmetry indicates a future rise in prices and a buy signal for savvy traders and investors.

Ripple dumps 150 million as XRP whales accumulate 110 million
Conversely, Ripple started its monthly dumps in May by selling 150 million XRP at an approximate value of $75 million. The sell-off is part of the company’s revenue model, releasing locked tokens from the genesis block and making them circulate—essentially inflating XRP supply.
Ripple unlocks 1 billion XRP on the first day of every month and sends 200 million to its treasury reserves. This activity pressures the cryptocurrency price, considering that new XRP tokens are available for whales to purchase.
For example, the company’s recent supply increase overwhelmed the recent 110 million whale demand. Meanwhile, investors actively look for further developments in the market to understand when is the best time to make a purchase, or exit a position, according to the asset’s economic dynamics.

El Salvador: Bitcoin mining with geothermal volcanic energy

El Salvador has made global headlines for its innovative initiatives in the field of cryptocurrencies, particularly for the use of geothermal volcanic energy in Bitcoin mining. 
This small Central American nation has accumulated a total of 5,750 Bitcoin, worth 354 million dollars, over a period of three years. 
Among these, 474 Bitcoins, worth about 29 million dollars, have been mined using volcanic geothermal energy since 2021.

The context of Bitcoin mining in El Salvador
In September 2021, El Salvador became the first country in the world to adopt Bitcoin as legal tender, alongside the US dollar. This historic step was part of a broader strategy to promote financial inclusion, attract foreign investments, and reduce remittance costs. However, the implementation of Bitcoin as legal tender has sparked numerous debates and controversies at both national and international levels.
El Salvador is located in an active volcanic region, which gives it a significant potential for geothermal energy production. The Tecapa volcano, in particular, has been used to power Bitcoin mining operations. 
The state power plant has produced 102 megawatts (MW) of energy, of which 1.5 MW were specifically allocated to cryptocurrency mining. This facility uses around 300 mining processors to extract Bitcoin, a process known for its high energy consumption.
Bitcoin mining is a process that involves solving complex mathematical problems to verify transactions on the Bitcoin network. This requires a large amount of computing power and, consequently, a significant amount of energy. 
By using geothermal energy, El Salvador has managed to make the mining process more sustainable and environmentally friendly, reducing dependence on non-renewable energy sources.
The use of geothermal energy for Bitcoin mining has several advantages. First of all, it reduces operating costs, as geothermal energy is generally less expensive than conventional energy sources. Furthermore, geothermal energy is a renewable and clean energy source, which helps to reduce the environmental impact associated with cryptocurrency mining.
Challenges and Controversies
In a global context where climate change is a growing concern, El Salvador’s approach represents a positive example of how emerging technologies can be integrated with sustainable solutions. This model could be replicated in other regions with similar geothermal resources, promoting a greener cryptocurrency mining industry.
Despite the benefits, El Salvador’s initiative is not without challenges. The adoption of Bitcoin as legal tender has been met with skepticism by international financial institutions, such as the International Monetary Fund (IMF), which has expressed concerns about economic stability and the risks associated with cryptocurrencies.
Furthermore, there have also been internal disorders, with a part of the population protesting against the adoption of Bitcoin, citing concerns about the volatility of the cryptocurrency and the lack of adequate infrastructure for its widespread use.
Despite the controversies, the Salvadoran government, led by President Nayib Bukele, remains firm in its commitment to Bitcoin. The extraction of 474 Bitcoin using volcanic energy is just an initial step in a broader strategy to leverage the country’s natural resources for economic growth and technological innovation.
The government is also exploring further uses of geothermal energy for other technological and industrial projects, aiming to transform El Salvador into a hub for innovation and technology in Latin America.
Conclusion
The initiative of El Salvador to use volcanic geothermal energy for Bitcoin mining represents a significant breakthrough in the global cryptocurrency landscape. Although not without challenges, this strategy demonstrates how natural resources and emerging technologies can be integrated to promote sustainable economic development.
With its pioneering approach, El Salvador is charting a new course that could be followed by other countries looking for innovative and sustainable solutions in the world of cryptocurrencies.

Bitcoin Rises on CPI Inflation Data As Experts Predict Miners Send BTC Parabolic - The Daily Hodl


								Bitcoin (BTC) has printed a sudden 7% bounce following data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) revealing that inflation data cooled in April.
According to the BLS, the Consumer Price Index (CPI), which is a measure of the average change over time in the prices paid by urban consumers for a market basket of consumer goods and services, increased by 0.3%, slightly less than what was forecasted.










Both Bitcoin and stock markets responded well to the data, with the S&P500 reaching new all-time highs above the 5,300 level, and BTC rebounding to $65,152.
With Bitcoin’s halving now in the rearview, analysts are waiting to see how the BTC mining ecosystem will react to its rewards being cut in half, and the effect it could have on the leading crypto asset by market cap.
Quant analyst PlanB says that based on the historical correlation between miner revenue and price action, BTC should go “vertical” later in 2024 as the industry’s revenue recovers from the halving.
“Historically, bitcoin miner revenue recovers 2-5 months after a halving, and after that Bitcoin price goes vertical.”
Source: PlanB/X
On-chain analyst Willy Woo says that the mining industry could consolidate to fewer, stronger miners who are less likely to sell due to having larger margins and more efficient business models, thus easing sell pressure on Bitcoin.
“Thesis:
Inefficient miners get culled at the halving.
They dump their BTC before dying.
Only the strong ones survive.
They operate on fatter margins so don’t need to sell.
Miner sell pressure gone.
Takes 2-5 months for the new supply/demand to reflect in price.”
Fundstrat’s Tom Lee is also optimistic about Bitcoin miners, saying that miners have the “leverage” to pump the price of BTC further.
At time of writing, Bitcoin is trading at $64,980.

Ethereum ETFs in Doubt: BlackRock Filing Details SEC's Play - DailyCoin


        

The SEC has not yet decided on the first Ether ETF as an old filing has raised questions about Ether’s classification.



Analysts believe the SEC may reject applications due to how Ether will be categorized.



The fate of several other Ether ETF applications hinges on the SEC’s upcoming verdict.




The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) is set to deliver a verdict on the first spot Ether ETF application by May 23, but a recent filing has cast doubt on the entire class of Ether ETFs. The filing, unearthed by legal experts, hints at the SEC potentially classifying Ether (ETH) as a security, a move that could significantly impact the cryptocurrency market.



SEC Roadblock for Spot Ether ETFs?



The unearthed details come from a March filing by BlackRock, which sought to list a spot Ether ETF on the Nasdaq. While the filing delayed the SEC’s decision on BlackRock’s ETF until June, it also raised a critical question: can Ether be classified as a commodity to qualify for a commodity-based ETF structure?




Analysts believe this could be a strategy by the SEC to reject spot Ether ETF applications. “The filing suggests they might deny these applications on the grounds that they’re improperly filed as commodity-based trusts holding a security,” explains Scott Johnsson, an Associate at Davis Polk and Wardwell.







This aligns with the current skepticism surrounding spot Ether ETF approvals. Bloomberg ETF analyst Eric Balchunas believes the SEC’s chances of approving these ETFs are “slim to none.”



Will SEC Approve VanEck’s Offering?



The fate of several spot Ether ETF applications hinges on the SEC’s decision on VanEck’s offering, which is the first in line. If rejected, ARK 21Shares, Hashdex, Invesco Galaxy, BlackRock, and Fidelity applications could all face similar denials. Notably, Grayscale also withdrew its spot Ether ETF application earlier in May, further adding to the uncertainty.



The core of the issue lies in how the SEC classifies Ether. While SEC Chair Gary Gensler previously stated Ether wasn’t a security, reports suggest an ongoing SEC investigation into the cryptocurrency. This investigation and the recent filing create confusion for the industry.




All eyes will be on the SEC as they decide on VanEck’s application on May 23. Additionally, Chair Gensler’s speech at the Investment Company Institute summit on the same day may shed light on the SEC’s stance towards Ether and spot Ether ETFs.



On the Flipside




The industry could challenge Ether’s security classification in court, delaying any final decision on spot Ether ETFs.



Grayscale withdrawing its application could indicate a shift in its strategy, not necessarily a reflection on the overall viability of spot Ether ETFs.



Even if the SEC rejects VanEck’s application, it doesn’t necessarily mean all future applications will be denied.




Why This Matters



The SEC’s decision on the first spot Ether ETF application could set a precedent for the entire class, potentially derailing efforts to bring these investment vehicles to market and impacting how investors access and trade Ether, a major cryptocurrency with significant influence on the broader market.

Shiba Inu Burn Rate Suffers Scathing 91.94% Crash, What’s Happening? | Bitcoinist.com


								As the bearish pressures of the crypto market catches up to Shiba Inu, it has begun to manifest in other metrics of the meme coin. The most prominent in recent times is the SHIB burn rate, which has taken a significant nosedive during this time.
Shiba Inu Burn Rate Crashes 91.94%
In a surprising turn of events, the Shiba Inu burn rate has seen a significant decline of 91.94%. This drop comes in the last 24 hours, underscoring the lack of attention to this metric, as well as the conservative stance that investors have taken during this time.

According to the Shiba Inu burn tracking website, Shibburn, there were only 2.367 million SHIB tokens burned in the last day. This is in stark contrast to the 29.5 million that were burned the prior day. Also, looking at the burn rates from this week, it shows that this lack of interest is very recent and may have to do with the Bitcoin price crashing below $62,000.
Source: Shibburn
For example, on May 13, Shibburn reported that over 20.2 million tokens were burned, which was a 94.7% increase at the time. What followed this was the 29.5 million that was recorded on May 14, and at the time, it was an over 110% increase in the burn rate.
The lack of interest is also reflected in the number of burn transactions recorded in the 24-hour period. So far, only four burn transactions have been recorded in the last day, with the largest transaction carrying around 1.5 million SHIB. Furthermore, the last burn transaction was recorded 16 hours ago, as at the time of writing.
This decline in the daily burn rate has also impacted the weekly burn rate. Shibburn’s report show a 143.35 million token burn rate in the last week, which is only a meager 3.59% increase from the figures recorded in the prior week.


SHIB Investors Are Still Holding
Usually, when Shiba Inu burn rate declines, it often points to investors choosing to hold on to their tokens, and this is often reflected in their selling rate. According to data from Santiment, this trend has held as SHIB investors have refrained from sending their tokens to exchanges, leading to a significant drop in active SHIB deposits.

Source: Glassnode
This is bullish for the meme coin because when investors choose to send their tokens to exchanges, it means that they are looking to sell. In the present case of Shiba Inu, investors are choosing to hold on to their tokens rather than send them to exchanges, which means that they are not willing to sell.
An unwillingness to sell will crash the selling pressure and once demand surpasses the supply, then prices will have to recover. If Shiba Inu investors continue this trend, and the crypto market recovers once more, then the meme coin may be poised to rally from here.

Bitcoin and Dogecoin didn't join the meme stock party. Here's why

This week, meme stocks came back into the limelight after Roaring Kitty, the investor behind the GameStop saga in 2021, made a comeback on social media and sparked a renewed frenzy, lifting other meme stocks. Why Nvidia needs to deliver on Q1 earningsHowever, the price of Bitcoin and memecoins, such as Dogecoin and Shiba Inu, did not rise significantly. On Wednesday afternoon, Dogecoin and Shiba Inu both were up 2.5% and 1.5%, respectively, while the top cryptocurrency Bitcoin was up over 5%.During GameStop’s hike on Monday, Doge and Shiba jumped nearly 6% and 5%, respectively, but this is not extraordinary given how memecoins have rallied in the past after the meteoric rise of meme stocks.  The GameStop saga contributed greatly to Doge’s success in 2021. Dogecoin caught the attention of investors who were looking for a cryptocurrency equivalent to meme stock GameStop. Just as GameStop reached its peak, Dogecoin started to gain traction, peaking in May 2021 at $0.74 per coin.But this time, nothing like that happened. When meme stocks returned to action earlier this week, memecoins like Floki and Popcat experienced double-digit gains, but they don’t have the same market share and popularity as Doge and Shiba. To everyone’s surprise, Dogecoin and Shiba Inu remained unfazed by the meme stock craze as if they had no relationship to it.That’s because crypto has evolved and become more macro, said Pat Doyle, a blockchain researcher at Amberdata, in an email. The recent meme stock rally wasn’t expected to last long the way it did in 2021, as mentioned by some experts. Doyle echoed the same sentiment by saying that 2021 had many catalysts, including covid, remote work, online time being increased, and stimulus checks being issued, among others, and none of them are happening in 2024.However, this doesn’t mean that these trends don’t affect crypto at all, as different pockets of crypto will react differently to equity market movements, he clarified.“One memecoin called GME (no relation to the stock) saw insane returns after Roaring Kitty returned to Twitter. However, the rest of the crypto assets in DeFi segments remained stable,” he wrote.“While the crypto space has grown and seen more adoption and maturity, the cost of deploying a memecoin is relatively low, which is why we are seeing such growth in this segment.”Cryptocurrency has become more mainstream this year as the Securities and Exchange Commission allowed the spot Bitcoin ETFs in January. This resulted in financial giants such as BlackRock and Fidelity jumping into the blockchain and crypto world and sending crypto to new heights.

Bitcoin is up $3,000 as U.S. CPI data reveals slower inflation in April


Bitcoin’s (BTC) price surged by $3,000 following the latest U.S. Consumer Price Index (CPI) report for April, which indicated a slowdown in inflation, boosting investor sentiment towards risk assets.
The U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics reported a rise in consumer prices by 3.4% in April year-over-year, a decrease from March’s 3.7%. 
This slower inflation rate has influenced a positive shift in market dynamics, with major stock indices reaching new highs and cryptocurrency prices, including Bitcoin and Ethereum (ETH), seeing significant upticks.


  U.S. CPI chart. Source: Bureau of Labor Statistics
This data, provided by the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, indicates a moderation in inflation, which is a positive signal for markets sensitive to interest rate changes. Month-on-month, the CPI rose by 0.3%, slightly below the expected 0.4%.
In this regard, data provided by capital market commentary platform The Kobeissi Letter, in an X post on May 15, pointed out that while the latest CPI data shows the first decline in inflation in three months, the PPI data reveals a third consecutive monthly increase.

Given these conflicting trends, the Federal Reserve is expected to adopt a “wait and see” approach regarding future monetary policy decisions.
U.S. CPI data and its Impact
Following the CPI release, major U.S. stock indices responded with significant gains. The S&P 500 rose by 0.48%, and the Nasdaq Composite Index (NASX) increased by 0.7%, both setting new records. 
The tech sector, in particular, showed robust performance with the NASDAQ-100 Technology Sector Index climbing by 0.72%. These gains reflect growing confidence among investors that the Federal Reserve may adopt a more accommodative monetary policy in the near future.
The bond market reacted to the CPI data with a decrease in yields for both 2-year and 10-year U.S. government bonds, with the 10-year Treasury yield sliding seven basis points to 4.37%. 
Additionally the U.S. dollar index (DXY) dropped 0.5%, and gold added 0.7%
BTC price analysis
BTC USD 1 day price chart. Source: TradingView
BTC is now trading at $64,884.00, with a 1-day rise of around 6%. Analysts note that Bitcoin now faces a crucial technical barrier in the form of its 50-day moving average (DMA) at $65,166. 
If Bitcoin’s price can break above this level and its May highs around $65,500, further short-term upside could follow. The next levels to watch would be the late-April highs around $67,000, with a retest of yearly highs in the $73,000 area as the subsequent target.
The latest U.S. CPI data has significantly impacted the market, with Bitcoin experiencing a notable price surge. Investors are optimistic about potential shifts in the Federal Reserve’s monetary policy, contributing to gains in both the stock and cryptocurrency markets.
As Bitcoin approaches critical technical levels, its performance in the coming days will be crucial for determining its short-term trajectory.

Crypto Traders As Socially Valuable As Escorts To Brits, Study Finds - Benzinga

A study by researchers Gemma Newlands and Christoph Lutz found that Brits perceive cryptocurrency traders to be about as socially valuable as escorts.What’s Next: The study, titled “Occupational Prestige and Occupational Social Value in the United Kingdom,” highlights the evolving nature of occupational prestige and social value, offering a comprehensive analysis of 576 occupations.One of the most striking findings of the study is the low social value assigned to digital economy occupations.Cryptocurrency traders, in particular, were ranked near escorts in terms of their perceived usefulness to society.The study’s findings are based on a survey of 2,429 respondents, who were asked to rate the prestige and social value of various occupations on a scale of 0 to 100. Healthcare occupations, such as cardiologists and ambulance paramedics, topped the rankings for both prestige and social value. Conversely, illicit and stigmatized occupations, including human traffickers and online scammers, were rated lowest in both categories.“This highlights a significant disconnect between the economic impact of these professions and public perception,” said Dr. Newlands. “Despite the growing influence of digital finance, many people still view these roles with skepticism.”Also Read: How You Can Make ‘Serious’ Money In Bitcoin This Year: 10x ResearchWhy It Matters: The study underscores the distinct evaluation axes of occupational prestige and occupational social value.While prestige often correlates with education and income, social value is linked to an occupation’s perceived contribution to societal well-being. Dr. Lutz elaborated, “Occupational prestige and social value, although correlated, are distinct constructs. Our findings show that many high-prestige occupations do not necessarily have high social value, and vice versa.”For instance, footballers and investment bankers, who enjoy high prestige, scored significantly lower in social value. On the other hand, roles such as street cleaners and refuse collectors, though low in prestige, were deemed highly valuable for their societal contributions. “This divergence points to the complex ways in which we evaluate work and its impact,” Dr. Lutz noted.The implications of these findings extend beyond academic interest, touching on broader societal issues. The study encourages policymakers and employers to consider how occupational roles are valued and to address the perceived deficits in social value, especially in emerging fields. “There is a need to bridge the gap between public perception and the actual contributions of digital economy professions,” suggested Dr. Newlands.What’s Next: Benzinga’s Future of Digital Assets event on Nov. 19 provides a timely opportunity to discuss these findings and explore ways to enhance the societal value of digital economy occupations.

Opinion: Roaring Kitty looks to have returned as a pump-and-dumper


There was something different about the way that Keith Gill (aka RoaringKitty on YouTube or DeepFuckingValue on Reddit) used to shill GameStop. He’d do in-depth, long, and extensive live streams and videos sharing his thesis, always instructed that people should reflect on their personal financial situation before buying or selling shares, and generally told followers to take profit when they wanted to.
Gill was also quite active on YouTube and Reddit, where he’d show his own portfolio so people knew whether or not he was adding to or subtracting from positions.
But since he’s returned from his social media hiatus, which started with a meme about AMC stock that well-known pump and dumper Zack Morris had used a few days before, the public has witnessed a huge departure from this approach.
This time, Roaring Kitty isn’t sharing his theses or his portfolio positions, nor is he explaining why he likes certain stocks or live streaming for five hours at a time. Instead, he’s shitposting memes, clearly advocating for GameStop as a great buy (despite his previous thesis failing miserably), and basically pumping a stock for no clear reason.
RoaringKitty is no longer a thesis-driven trader — he’s another average pump-and-dumper with a large audience.

Read more: Andrew Tate seems confused as he dumps bitcoin to buy GameStop
Disappointing Kitty
There are any number of reasons that Gill could give to justify his posting of dozens of vague memes posted from his X (formerly Twitter) account, now boasting over a million followers.
For instance, it’s fair to say that since 2021, when meme stocks first became a concept and Gabe Plotkin blew up his fund, Melvin Capital, very little has changed in the finance world — particularly in regard to the issues that caused RobinHood to shutter all buying of certain stocks and the complexities of capital requirements.
Unfortunately, there is no Gabe Plotkin, Steve Cohen, Vlad Tenev, or Ken Griffin to frame up as the stereotypical villain. No evil VCs or hedgies are openly discussing shorting GameStop, short interest is nowhere near levels seen in 2021, and GameStop is little more than a company walking the thin line between failing business and bankruptcy protection.
Revisiting old Gill live streams and videos, you can listen to his thesis: GameStop will be the Amazon of gaming, it’s apparently going to build a massive digital marketplace, NFTs will play an important role, and locations are important so gamers can trade in old games and buy physical copies.
Needless to say, none of these theories panned out. Indeed, GameStop has closed 200+ stores in three years, it’s not making money, and Cohen has been a terrible CEO.
A new beginning for Roaring Kitty
Am I surprised that Roaring Kitty’s valiant return is to shitpost and pump and dump? Of course not. I imagine that the desire to take the easy road is almost impossible to resist when you know that one single tweet can move a stock 50%+.
I’m not sure how many individuals could stop themselves from doing so, especially if a win was almost guaranteed. But it is disappointing to see someone who spent years proudly shilling his investment the right way to turn around and immediately give in to his every whim.
I don’t know what’s next for Keith Gill, but I wouldn’t be surprised to see Gary Gensler ask him more questions and scour his tweets for any possible way in which he broke rules and regulations.
I’m not sure what happened to Gill but he’s certainly not the same. Not only that, the new version of him isn’t as interesting, doesn’t have nearly as much to say, and, let’s face it, is a shadow of the hopeful figure he once presented for retail traders.

Crypto trader turns $155,000 to $1.16 million in two days


A cryptocurrency trader has turned an initial investment of $155,000 into a $1.16 million portfolio in two days. The trades occurred on Solana (SOL), speculating on the meme coins AMC and GME amid Roaring Kitty’s return.
Lookonchain reported the anonymous trader’s nearly 650% gains in a post on X on May 15. The crypto trader allocated $61,000 to buy 27.58 million AMC and $94,000 for 30.78 million GME. Currently, their combined value is now $1.16 million.

These meme coins play off the popularity of AMC Entertainment (NYSE: AMC) and GameStop (NYSE: GME) stocks, now back on speculators’ radar after their success during the 2021 GameStop short squeeze.


Roaring Kitty’s come-back
Meme coins have seen a resurgence in the cryptocurrency market after a period of low activity. This renewed interest emerged following the return of the famous meme trader Keith Gill on social platforms on May 13. Gill, known as Roaring Kitty, became known for inspiring the GME short squeeze in 2021.
Roaring Kitty has been actively posting videos on X, hinting at the next meme asset he intends to boost. This wave of activity has ignited interest among traders, prompting many to follow his speculative moves closely.

Crypto traders lost ‘tens of thousands of dollars’ trading GME
However, some traders experienced significant losses trading GME, despite the success of a few. Another Lookonchain post highlighted that not everyone profited from the meme coin. 
“These three guys lost tens of thousands of dollars by buying GME with FOMO and panic selling after the price dropped!” the post stated. Lookonchain emphasized the importance of not buying with fears of missing out (FOMO) when prices are soaring, nor panic selling when they decline.

Previously, Finbold reported the story of a meme coin trader on Solana who lost $37,000 in 17 minutes due to the same combination of FOMO and panic selling. An issue that is common in the meme coin crypto casino, mainly among beginners trying to make “easy money.”
These incidents underscore the volatility and high-risk nature of cryptocurrencies, especially with meme coins. It also highlights the impact of influential figures like Roaring Kitty on trading behaviors. With meme coins back in the spotlight, traders are both eager and cautious, wary of repeating past mistakes while hoping for substantial gains.

Diamond Paws (DIAPAWS) to Explode 17,000% Ahead of MEXC Listing, as Shiba Inu, Bonk, and Dogecoin Lag



                    

Early investors in memecoins like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Bonk (BONK), and Dogecoin (DOGE) made astronomical returns, and Diamond Paws (DIAPAWS) presents a similar opportunity for a limited time.



Diamond Paws (DIAPAWS), a newly launched Solana memecoin, is poised to explode over 17,000% in a matter of days, as former Shiba Inu (SHIB), Bonk (BONK), and Dogecoin (DOGE) investors pour funds into this new token.




DIAPAWS will be listed on MEXC, one of the largest centralized exchanges in the world, within a few days – and this is a massively bullish development for the token, as millions of new investors will easily be able to buy Diamond Paws.



Currently, Diamond Paws can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jupiter and Raydium, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days.



To buy DIAPAWS on these platforms, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask, or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Diamond Paws by entering its contract address – HCEn3J1sKqMqPxrQDE33rGhJvyXh4r3YgyzD2wiAm3ga – in the receiving field.




DIAPAWS currently has a market cap of just under $16,000, with over $4,000 in locked liquidity, meaning it has huge upside potential.



Early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE), and Bonk (BONK) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price.



If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner.

SHIB Makes Use of Falling Wedge as Exchange Reserves Plummet - DailyCoin


        

Shiba Inu cryptocurrency exchange reserves dropped to early 2022 levels.



Falling wedge pattern on SHIB’s daily charts marks a likely inflection point.



Contrarily, one crypto brokerage firm pours 144B SHIB coins into Coinbase.




According to the latest on-chain data from CryptoQuant, the second largest meme coin asset, Shiba Inu (SHIB), is becoming scarce on cryptocurrency exchanges. SHIB reserves have plunged by a whopping 95 trillion since June 26, 2021, when they were at an all-time peak of 246 trillion tokens.



Are Slimming SHIB Exchange Reserves Bullish?



Moreover, Shiba Inu’s reserves have dramatically plunged this year, starting in late February 2024. The notable decrease can be ascribed to the rising demand for meme coins. March 2024 has gone down in crypto’s history books as the most successful month for meme coins, with the cycle peak topping $56 billion at one point.







Depicted in blue, the shrinking exchange reserves now consist of approximately 151T. Large holders moved another 5T SHIB off exchanges from March 31, confirming the large holder sentiment surrounding the canine token. Shiba Inu’s transfers to self-custodial wallets indicate SHIB as a long-term investment and means of storage.



Falling Wedge Pattern Hints at Another Leg?



Meanwhile, Shiba Inu’s price performance produced a falling wedge pattern on the 1-day technical charts. Dami Defi on X spotted this and forecasted a 50% run potential if SHIB broke out. The sloping-down pattern depicted below can signal a positive price trend switch.







Usually developed over several months, falling wedges in crypto culminate in a bullish breakout when the crypto price convincingly exceeds the upper resistance line, supported by a strong increase in trading volume. Shiba Inu is trying to put the falling wedge pattern in effect with a slight increase of 1.5% to trade at $0.00002398.



Zooming out of the daily charts, the #12 seated Shiba Inu embarked on a 14.7% run over the past two weeks, bringing a 169% yearly return. For the falling wedge pattern to inspire another leg, Shiba Inu’s daily close is above $0.000024, as this narrow resistance line with 10.15T SHIB in 27.5K addresses presents a favorable setup due to fewer traders liable to sell their SHIB tokens.



On the Flipside




While a tendency to withdraw SHIB from exchanges persists, some large holders are also doing the opposite.



For instance, on May 15, 2024, cryptocurrency brokerage firm Cumberland deposited 144 billion SHIB tokens worth $3.3 million.



Earlier, the crypto fund also deposited 50.36B SHIB coins into OKX, leaving just $45K worth of SHIB on balance.




Why This Matters



Besides estimating demand, exchange reserves can indicate whether holders of a cryptocurrency are seeking to trade the crypto or keep it as a long-term investment.

Crypto Markets Bounce Back as Core U.S Inflation Hits 3-Year Low - The Defiant

Bitcoin surged 6% to $65,000, with Ether and Solana rallying 3% and 7%, respectively. Crypto markets rallied on Wednesday morning after the latest U.S. inflation figures came in under economists’ expectations.The US Bureau of Labor Statistics reported that the Consumer Price Index (CPI) rose by 0.3% in April, falling short of the Dow Jones estimate of 0.4%. On an annualized basis, the CPI increased by 3.4%, in line with expectations but down from 3.7% in March.The CPI measures the average change over time in the prices paid by consumers for a basket of goods and services. It impacts crypto markets by influencing investor sentiment and economic forecasts; lower-than-expected CPI can boost confidence in risk assets like cryptocurrencies, while higher CPI can trigger fears of inflation and potentially more restrictive policy measures from the Federal Reserve.Bitcoin (BTC) is trading at $65,000, marking a 6% increase in the last 24 hours. Ether (ETH) ticked up by more than 3%, while Solana (SOL) soared by nearly 8%, according to CoinGecko data.BTC PriceAmong meme coins, FLOKI (FLOKI) tops the charts with a 13% gain. Dogecoin (DOGE) and Shiba Inu (SHIB) also posted increases of between 2% and 4%.Crypto analyst Justin Bennett said, “BTC is hanging by a thread. The $61k support area is holding, but the longer Bitcoin trades below $65k on the weekly and monthly time frames, the worse this looks.”Michael Van de Poppe, CEO of MN Trading, told The Defiant that Ethereum is in the final stages of its correction. “Around 10% more to decline before hitting a higher timeframe support level. The good times are just a few weeks away,” he said.Meanwhile, the State of Wisconsin Investment Board disclosed in a May 14 filing with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) that it had purchased approximately $100 million worth of the BlackRock iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) and $64 million in the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC).AMC and GameStop tankAMC Entertainment and GameStop shares dropped in early morning trading as the momentum from the meme stock craze — rekindled on Monday by the social media return of "Roaring Kitty" — started to wane. AMC fell by 30% on Wednesday morning, while GameStop shares plummeted by 35%.However, broader U.S. stock markets posted gains following the inflation report. Both the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq Composite hit all-time highs on Wednesday.The S&P 500 increased by 1%, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq rose by 1.2%. The Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 0.8%.

This Trader Sees A 'Barbell Portfolio Of BTC And Memes' As Most Profitable Trading Strategy - Benzinga

Crypto trader Cred sees the polarizing sentiment in the current market as a consequence of the disparities in opinions to unevenly distributed returns and the absence of traditional cycle indicators.What Happened: The trader took to his X account to point out that the usual “risk curve” strategy—from BTC to Ethereum ETH/USD, then to large caps, mid-caps, and finally meme coins—has proven unprofitable this cycle. Instead, a barbell portfolio of BTC and memes has outperformed other strategies.Cred notes that ETH/BTC has shown unusual weakness, whereas it typically thrives in a risk-on environment. This weakness extends to ETH Layer-1 (L1) and Layer-2 (L2) trades, with meme coins on Solana SOL/USD outperforming NFTs on Ethereum, marking a shift in the "crypto as a casino" thesis.Also Read: Why This Crypto Market Is ‘A Bear Trap’ And Which Coins This Trader Is BackingMeme Coins Surging: End Of Cycle?Cred points out that meme coins have consistently led the market. Unlike in previous cycles, rotating out of meme coins has been costly, challenging the common belief that a surge in meme coin prices signals the end of a cycle.Bitcoin has deviated from its traditional bull market behavior by not experiencing the standard 30-40% pullbacks. This anomaly has sidelined many traders and given rise to various theories, including shorter cycle and super cycle narratives.The proliferation of tokens, amplified by meme coins, means that the "crypto bull market" no longer implies that all listed assets will rise. Instead, there are distinct winners and losers, with clear leaders like Solana outperforming stagnant sectors like the ETH ecosystem.Diverse traders, Diverse strategiesCred acknowledges the resulting diverse experiences and perspectives among traders. "It's entirely plausible that you have Trader A who rode Bitcoin, Solana, and memes and feels like stuff is hot and needs to cool off, whereas Trader B has barely made any money and feels like stuff hasn't even picked up yet," he notes.He emphasizes that different portfolios, trading styles, time horizons, and risk appetites contribute to the varied outlooks. Despite the disparities, Cred encourages the crypto community to stay calm and kind, as most traders believe in the long-term upward trajectory of the market.In response to Cred’s thesis, macro trader Alex Krüger said that the super cycle implies there are no more 85% drawdowns, but recurrent 20%-40% corrections, with regular ETF inflows and bitcoin partially dragged up by equities. He agrees that there may be a “supercycle,” but only for Bitcoin and not for altcoins.What’s Next: The influence of Bitcoin as an institutional asset class is expected to be thoroughly explored at Benzinga’s upcoming Future of Digital Assets event on Nov. 19.Read Next: Bitcoin Boom Sparks Surge In Crypto Wallet Recovery Services: ‘It’s Just Pure Economics’This content was partially produced with the help of AI tools and was reviewed and published by Benzinga editors.Image created using artificial intelligence with Midjourney.

                        Meme coin markets are in overdrive, and Floki Inu is on the climb, with FLOKI bulls now targeting a new all-time high after an aggressive upside move triggered by Revolut.It’s no secret that dog-coins are here to stay. In fact, the unique staying power of Dog-themed cryptocurrencies is deserving of a focused study by academics.As an icon in the meme coin market since 2021, Floki Inu is once again leading the charge.The latest upside move appears to have been fuelled by a bullish listing for Floki Inu on Revolut Business, enabling European commercial accounts to invest in the FLOKI asset.FLOKI Price Prediction: Floki Inu Climbs +10.8% Bringing Week-On-Week Gains to +28%
As price actions hold strong in bullish form, Floki Inu is currently trading at a market price of $0.00022 (Representing a 24-hour change of +17%).The upside move, which was fuelled by a positive fundamental shift in the winds from Revolut, provided FLOKI with the perfect bullish third bounce off lower trendline support earlier this week.With a triple re-test of support for the bullish trading channel, it seems probable that there is now sufficient confidence in FLOKI’s technical structure to mount a higher push.This is contingent on FLOKI smashing up through a local layer of upside resistance around $0.00025.However, if bulls can fuel a price move above these levels, then FLOKI is left targeting a move up that will see price action attempt a new all-time high (with $0.00035 forming a strategic goal).Meanwhile, the upside movement could demand a brief stop-off ahead of its next push as the RSI shifts to a moderate bearish divergence at 67.32, although with sufficient momentum, an upside move could extend the RSI’s bearish signals as high as 85.Overall, with impressive technical form stemming from FLOKI’s triple-tested lower trendline, strong fundamental news, and capacity remaining on the RSI, upside moves are likely in the week ahead.To the upside, FLOKI targets a break above the ATH to hit $0.00035 in May (a potential +57%).Meanwhile, the downside risk could be that FLOKI returns to lower support at $0.00015 (a possible -32%).This leaves the FLOKI price prediction suggesting a risk: reward of 1.79 in the weeks to come—a bullish entry with moderate gains to be secured.But for some investors, 0.5x returns aren’t the reason they got into crypto, and to those investors – look no further than the latest Dog Coin craze: Dogeverse – the 1st multichain DOGE.Discover DOGEVERSE as Presale Slams Impressive $15m Raised Ahead of Explosive Multi-chain Launch
DOGEVERSE is continuing to snowball with viral traction on the BASE chain, as the fastest-growing meme coin presale surges past $15m raised – here’s what’s going on.The answer is simple: the unification of DOGE across all major blockchains.You heard that right – whilst the original Dogecoin has inspired a huge family of spin-off tokens – no DOGE-linked meme coin has ever delivered multi-chain trading. DOGEVERSE is here to fill that huge void in the year of Omnichain cryptocurrency.DOGEVERSE will operate on Ethereum, Polygon, BNB Chain, Solana, Avalanche, and Base, a multichain feature that supporters will drive prices in 2024.Moreover, holders cite DOGEVERSE’s capped supply of 200 million combined with staking as attractive attributes.These features will likely create a supply squeeze, progressively lifting prices over time.Buy DOGEVERSE Here
