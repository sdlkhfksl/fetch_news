Why Are Many Altcoins Down Bad? It's Not Because Of Meme Coins, VC Points Out - Benzinga

A new article by Haseeb Qureshi, Managing Partner at Dragonfly, challenges popular narratives surrounding the recent slump in altcoin prices.What Happened: Qureshi’s article challenged three prevalent theories regarding the underperformance of these altcoins: venture capitalists (VCs) and key opinion leaders (KOLs) dumping tokens, retail investors switching to meme coins and low circulating supply hindering price discovery.Qureshi presented data that shows a significant decline in recent Binance-listed tokens, excluding explicit meme coins and tokens with prior token generation events (TGEs). He used this data to refute the first theory that VCs and KOLs are dumping tokens on retail investors. "Every top tier VC that comes to your mind has at least a 1 year cliff and a multiyear vest before they get their tokens," Qureshi stated, pointing out that these VCs are still locked, making the dumping theory implausible.He then tackled the second theory, which suggests that retail investors are abandoning these tokens in favor of meme coins. By comparing trading volumes of these altcoins and meme coins like Shiba Inu SHIB/USD, Qureshi demonstrated that the timeline does not align. "Memecoin mania was a full on frenzy by March, but the basket dumped in April, a month and a half later," he notes, arguing that this disconnect disproves the theory of a retail exodus to meme coins.The third theory posits that the low circulating supply of these tokens prevents meaningful price discovery. Qureshi acknowledged that while low float can be problematic, it is not unique to the current market cycle.Also Read: ‘The Dogecoin Explosion Made Something Click In Me:’ Veteran Trader Shares Secrets To Turning Pennies Into Millions With Meme CoinsHe provided historical data showing similar circulating supplies in previous cycles and noted, "If this theory were correct, you should see the coins with the lowest floats getting punished, and higher floats should be doing OK. But we don't see a strong correlation."Qureshi concluded that these popular theories fail to explain the underperformance of these altcoins.Instead, he attributed the downturn to external market factors, particularly geopolitical tensions in the Middle East, which affected market sentiment in mid-April. "The market decided they didn't want to buy them back," he points out, suggesting that the broader market environment, rather than specific market structure issues, is to blame.Looking ahead, Qureshi advised VCs to exhibit price discipline, exchanges to list tokens at lower prices with better lockup terms, and project teams to increase token supply on day one to enhance price stability. He reassured projects currently experiencing price drops, citing historical precedents where now-successful projects initially faced similar declines. "Stay focused on building something worth being proud of and keep shipping. Markets will figure it out eventually," he encourages.What’s Next: For those interested in further discussions on digital assets and their market dynamics, the Benzinga’s Future of Digital Assets event on Nov. 19 promises to be an insightful platform.Read Next: Retail Trading Legend Roaring Kitty Returns After Three Years—Can He Spark Another Frenzy?

Crypto Heist or Revenge Story? Ex-Employee Arrested in $1.9M Case


							

Ex-employee arrested in $1.9M crypto exploit.



Blames platform, claims innocence.



Legal case ongoing, restrictions imposed.




Jarett Dunn, a former employee of the Solana-based memecoin launchpad pump.fun, has publicly disclosed his recent arrest by London Police in connection with an alleged $1.9 million exploit at the platform. Dunn, who uses the online aliases “staccoverflow” and “freestac,” detailed his arrest and subsequent release on bail in a series of social media posts.







Following the theft of $1.9 million in funds, pump.fun accused its former employee as responsible for the exploit, claiming that he misappropriated nearly 12,300 SOL using his privileged position.



Through his online posts, Dunn explained his arrest and its aftermath, stating that he was hospitalized following the incident. He further claimed, “Authorities detained me on suspicion of stealing $2 million of what pump.fun alleges are ill-gotten gains, with plans to steal an additional $80 million.”







Dunn also stated that he would be required to attend a police interview due to his mental state, which he claims has deteriorated significantly. He urged investors to withdraw their funds from pump.fun, alleging that the platform misrepresents its Total Value Locked (TVL) as legitimate funds. Additionally, he encouraged UK citizens to file legal complaints against the company.









A private investigation firm, The Rollup, has provided updates on the case following a thorough examination of Dunn’s situation. According to their findings, Dunn was released on bail by UK police and is required to return in August. He is reportedly subject to restrictions on communication with certain individuals. 



While the circumstances surrounding the alleged $1.9 million exploit at pump.fun remain murky. Jarett Dunn, who faces accusations and legal proceedings, his claims of innocence and allegations against the platform raise questions about the incident’s true nature.

How Does Crypto Work? | Cryptopolitan

Cryptocurrency is a digital revolution that has completely changed how we think about money.This guide dives into the basics, answering questions such as “how does crypto work?” We’ll also explore crypto’s rise and impact on the economy and daily transactions. Read on!Introduction to Cryptocurrency: The Digital Money RevolutionCryptocurrency is digital money that uses encryption to secure transactions. This means it’s safe and private. You can send cryptocurrency directly to someone else without needing to go to banks.Think of it as digital cash that lives on the internet.The Historical Context and the Rise of Digital CurrenciesDigital currencies emerged as a response to the 2008 financial crisis, where people wanted a financial system that wouldn’t be under the control of banks and governments. However, it’s impossible to talk about crypto without referring to Satoshi Nakamoto’s Bitcoin whitepaper. This new form of money would use blockchain technology for secure, transparent transactions. Over time, more digital currencies appeared, like Ethereum and Ripple, each offering unique features. The rise of these currencies has sparked a global discussion about the future of money. Today, they are part of investment portfolios and are slowly being accepted for everyday transactions.The Backbone of Cryptocurrency: Blockchain TechnologyBlockchain technology is the foundation of cryptocurrency. It is a digital ledger that records all transactions across a network of computers. This technology ensures security and transparency because it is decentralized. No single entity controls the blockchain, making it resistant to fraud and tampering.Every transaction made with cryptocurrency is recorded as a “block” of data. These blocks are linked together in chronological order, creating a continuous chain. Each block is visible to all users but secured by cryptography, meaning that once a transaction is added, it cannot be altered without changing all subsequent blocks, which requires consensus from the network majority.Blockchain’s potential goes beyond cryptocurrency. It is being explored for various applications, such as supply chain management, voting systems, and secure sharing of medical records. Its ability to provide a secure and transparent environment makes it a revolutionary technology in our digital age.The Significance of Decentralization in CryptoOne of cryptocurrency’s biggest features is its decentralized nature. In the finance industry, decentralization is completely revolutionary, changing how investors access funds and the availability of various financial instruments.All of a sudden, people don’t need central banks to access capital or trade anymore. This new crypto ecosystem powered by blockchain technology is significant, as it opens up finance to a broader range of individuals than traditional finance.With the global market cap for crypto topping $2 trillion at the time of writing this article, the opportunities remain endless for the space.Creating Digital Wealth: How Cryptocurrencies are Mined and ManagedBitcoin mining is a complex process that involves computational power and technological finesse. Its goal is to verify transactions within the Bitcoin network, which is the underlying function that makes the Bitcoin blockchain run without any interference from a centralized financial institution.People who participate in this process are called miners, and they receive compensation in Bitcoin for the resources they expend.The nomenclature “mining” draws parallels with the extraction of natural resources, as the availability of Bitcoins is finite, capped at 21 million. Like traditional mining, Bitcoin mining necessitates an investment of energy. This time, it takes the form of electrical power. Bitcoin mining is a highly competitive activity, as the race is perpetually on for the first miner to solve the computational puzzles or hash needed to validate the next block on the network.Notably, this puzzle-solving is executed solely by computers. Consequently, the computational power of a miner’s setup directly influences their capacity to make guesses per second, thus heightening their prospects of emerging victorious in the mining race.Bitcoin mining serves several primary objectives:Introducing new coins into circulation while concurrently validating ongoing transactions.Safeguarding against counterfeiting and double-spending.Upholding ledger integrity in a decentralized manner.Understanding Crypto Wallets: Hot vs. Cold Storage SolutionsA crypto digital wallet is essential for managing cryptocurrencies, and they come in two main types: hot and cold storage. A hot digital wallet is connected to the internet, making it convenient for frequent transactions. They’re software-based and accessible through devices like smartphones or computers. However, their online nature makes them more vulnerable to cyberattacks.Cold digital wallets, on the other hand, are offline storage solutions. They are often hardware-based, like USB devices, or can even be paper with printed keys. This detachment from the internet shields them from hacking and online threats, providing a high security level. This makes them ideal for long-term storage of large crypto amounts due to their enhanced security features.The Diverse World of CryptocurrencyHere’s an overview of the diverse world of crypto, and some of the popular tokens trending on the market today:Leading Cryptocurrencies: Bitcoin, Ethereum, and MoreIn the world of crypto, there are two main kinds of tokens: Bitcoin and altcoins. Bitcoin occupies an exalted role in the industry due to its status as the premier cryptocurrency, which is reflected in its tremendously high valuation today.However, despite its status as a widely accepted unit of exchange, Bitcoin has limited use cases. Enter Ethereum, one of the most unique crypto platforms. Ethereum is a blockchain platform known for its versatility. Beyond handling digital currency, it supports smart contracts and decentralized applications (dApps).Launched in 2015, Ethereum introduces programmability into the blockchain world, allowing developers to create varied applications. Its native cryptocurrency, Ether, powers transactions and operations within the network. Not all cryptocurrencies work the same way. Tether’s idea is to maintain a stable value always. It’s pegged to traditional currencies like the US dollar, with each Tether theoretically backed by one dollar held in reserve. Its stability makes it a favored choice for traders seeking to avoid the volatility typical of other cryptocurrencies.Other popular cryptocurrencies include BNB, the native token of the Binance Smart Chain, Solana, USDC, and XRP.Exploring Stablecoins: Bridging the Gap Between Crypto and FiatImagine a special kind of crypto money that acts like a bridge between the regular money you know and the digital money world. That’s what stablecoins are! They’re like crypto coins tethered to something steady, like real money (dollars, euros) or even gold. This keeps their value stable, unlike regular crypto that be extremely volatile.Stablecoins are handy because they let you enjoy regular crypto benefits like fast transfers and security, without the wild price swings.This is why they’re widely accepted as a means of exchange, similar to Bitcoin. Investing in Cryptocurrency: Risks and RewardsInvesting in cryptocurrencies comes with both risks and rewards, and understanding them is crucial for anyone diving into this market. Despite these risks, the rewards can be enticing, as there’s the opportunity for decentralization, anonymity, and the potential for substantial profits. Navigating the Risks: Security, Volatility, and RegulationOne major risk is security. Cryptocurrencies are stored in digital wallets, which can be vulnerable to hacking or phishing attacks. However, losing access to your digital wallet means losing your funds, with little to no chance of recovery. However, the potential rewards can be substantial. Another critical factor affecting crypto investing is volatility, where prices can swing wildly in short periods, leading to substantial gains or losses in a matter of hours. While this volatility presents opportunities for profit, it also heightens the risk of significant losses. Besides, there’s the issue of regulation to contend with. Today, governments worldwide continue to grapple with how to regulate cryptocurrencies, leading to a patchwork of rules and regulations. Such a dynamic landscape can impact the value and legality of cryptocurrencies, affecting investor sentiment and market dynamics.Practical Uses of Cryptocurrency in Today’s WorldCryptocurrency, once considered a niche asset, is now finding practical applications across various industries in today’s world. One of its biggest uses is as a medium of exchange. Cryptocurrency as a Medium of ExchangeToday, many businesses are accepting cryptocurrencies as payment for goods and services. From online retailers to local businesses, the adoption of cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum provides customers with more payment options and facilitates faster, cheaper cross-border transactions.This has also affected the remittance industry. Migrant workers often face high fees and lengthy processing times when sending money home to their families. Cryptocurrencies offer a cheaper and faster alternative, enabling instant transfers with lower transaction fees compared to traditional remittance services.Blockchain technology, the underlying technology behind cryptocurrencies, is also being leveraged for various practical applications beyond finance. Smart contracts, self-executing contracts with the terms of the agreement directly written into code, automate and enforce agreements without the need for intermediaries. This technology has applications in areas like supply chain management, real estate transactions, and legal contracts, streamlining processes and reducing costs.Additionally, cryptocurrencies serve as a hedge against inflation and political instability in countries with volatile fiat currencies. Citizens in countries facing economic crises or hyperinflation often turn to cryptocurrencies to preserve their wealth and protect against government interference.Furthermore, cryptocurrencies are empowering individuals in developing countries with limited access to traditional banking services. Through mobile devices, people can access financial services like savings, loans, and remittances using cryptocurrencies, bypassing the need for traditional banks.The Legal and Financial Landscape of CryptocurrencyWhile regulations vary by jurisdiction, most countries require individuals to report cryptocurrency transactions for tax purposes. This includes buying, selling, trading, and receiving cryptocurrencies as income.The taxation of cryptocurrencies often depends on how they are used. For instance, capital gains tax typically applies to profits made from selling cryptocurrencies, while income tax may apply to mining rewards or payments received in cryptocurrency.Furthermore, the lack of clear guidance in some jurisdictions has led to uncertainty regarding tax obligations related to cryptocurrencies. However, tax authorities are becoming more focused on enforcing compliance, and failure to report cryptocurrency transactions accurately can result in penalties or legal consequences.The Debate: Are Cryptocurrencies Financial Securities?The debate over whether cryptocurrencies should be classified as financial securities remains a big one. For instance, per SEC regulations, should a cryptocurrency satisfy the conditions for being deemed an investment contract, it becomes mandatory for the SEC to ensure its registration as an investment. Thus, it becomes subject to SEC oversight. However, when crypto is offered to institutional investors, it assumes the classification of an investment contract, and thus has to be classified as such.In future, clarifying the classification of cryptocurrencies as securities could have significant implications for their regulation, taxation, and use in the financial markets.Safeguarding Your Investment: Preventing Fraud and ScamsWhile it’s important to focus on making the right trading decisions and making more profits than losses, it’s even more essential to take the right steps to protect against fraud and scams.Recognizing and Avoiding Cryptocurrency ScamsCryptocurrency scams lurk around every corner, but staying vigilant can protect your hard-earned cash.The first step to avoiding these scams and protecting yourself from malicious pretenders is to recognize them from afar.One of the most common ways through which you may lose your funds is through a phishing scam. Here, malicious elements set up entirely false websites, and redirect you to pages with keylogging capacities.Often, you may be asked to provide sensitive details, such as your private keys. However, you should give away your private keys, which control your crypto, as legitimate platforms won’t ask for them.Also, if someone promises you’ll get rich quick with crypto, it’s a scam. Real investments come with risk, so if it seems too easy to be true, it’s most likely false.Also, don’t be rushed. Scammers want you to act fast before you do research. This also extends to social media, where you should always be wary of social media ads or unsolicited calls promoting crypto schemes.Best Practices for Secure Cryptocurrency InvestmentTo secure your crypto investments, it’s important to carry out thorough research into the project’s background, team, and white paper. Also, stick to only reputable crypto exchanges like Coinbase, Kraken and Binance with strong security measures. Finally, if an online romance involves crypto investment advice, it’s likely a scam, so avoid mixing love with finance.How to Get Started with CryptocurrenciesIf you’re serious about breaking through with cryptocurrency investments, the first stage is to choose the marketplace where you’ll purchase crypto.Choosing a Crypto Exchange: Factors to ConsiderHere are some of the most essential factors to consider when choosing cryptocurrency exchanges:Security: Look out for platforms with two-factor authentication, cold storage for offline funds, and a proven track record of keeping user assets safe.Regulation: Opt for exchanges compliant with local regulations. This adds a layer of security and consumer protection. Fees: Transaction fees can eat into your profits. So, compare trading fees, deposit/withdrawal fees, and any hidden costs.User Experience: A user-friendly interface is essential, especially if you’re a new investor. Some of the features to assess include ease of navigation, buying/selling process, and access to educational resources.Supported Cryptocurrencies: There’s no point option for cryptocurrency exchanges if they don’t support the crypto you want to trade, so make sure the exchange offers the cryptos you’re interested in buying and trading. Buying Your First Cryptocurrency: Step-by-Step GuideNow that you understand the implications and have digested the safety tips, it’s time to get right into how to purchase your first crypto tokens.Here’s a step-by-step guide to help you navigate:Step 1: Choose Your ExchangeThe first step is to research reputable exchanges like Coinbase or Binance. Consider factors like security, regulation, fees, and ease of use. For instance, if you’re a new user, you might want to opt for Binance because of its intuitive interface. However, a seasoned investor who needs advanced trading tools might find Coinbase more appealing.Whichever option you go for, don’t forget to ensure that it suits your trading needs.Step 2: Create an AccountAfter choosing a platform, the next step is to create an account. It’s important to note that you’ll have to supply basic information and verification documents where required.Reputable centralized exchange platforms have KYC and AML requirements to fulfill, which they do by requesting that customers provide certain levels of ID in order to access the platform.Some of the information that you may be required to provide include:Full nameDate of birthPicture of your faceUtility bill showing your addressTravel PassportWith most cryptocurrency exchanges, there are various membership tiers that provide different levels of access based on how much information you provide.After submitting the required credentials, you may be required to wait between a few hours and a week for them to be verified.Step 3: Fund Your AccountMost platforms allow deposits via bank transfer, debit card, or wire transfer. Choose your preferred method and purchase crypto with fiat. Note that different platforms may have deposit fees, so ensure to check the website or contact support to understand the requirements in this regard.Step 4: Select Your CryptocurrencyAfter funding your account, you’re now ready to purchase crypto! One significant difference between traditional finance and crypto investing is that the entry barrier is rather low.With many crypto exchanges, you can purchase crypto worth only a dollar. Regardless, there are several tokens to choose from. Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) are popular starting points due to their established presence.Step 5: Placing Your OrderExchanges offer different order types. For a simple purchase, use a “Market Order,” which buys at the current market price. There are two main order options- market orders and limit orders. The former executes your purchase immediately at the best available market price, while the former sets a specific price at which you want to buy. The order is only fulfilled if the price reaches that point.Step 6: Review and ConfirmThe next step is to double-check the amount of cryptocurrency you’re buying and the total cost, including any fees. Once satisfied, confirm the order.The Future of Cryptocurrency: Trends and PredictionsThe crypto market is known for its ups and downs, but some trends and predictions are worth noting. For one, big players like banks and financial institutions are showing growing interest in crypto, potentially leading to increased stability and legitimacy.Also, DeFi technology and NFTs are on the rise, allows for financial transactions without traditional intermediaries, and representing ownership of digital assets like art and collectibles respectively.With regards to price predictions, some predict Bitcoin reaching $77,000 in the next few years, fueled by factors like spot ETF approval and the halving event. Also, transforming real-world assets (like stocks) into digital tokens on blockchains could be a multi-trillion dollar market in the coming years.Wrapping UpThe most important thing to note about the crypto market is that it’s highly volatile. This, more than anything, is why it’s so essential to carry out your own research before investing.Despite recent breakthroughs, it should be noted that the blockchain industry is still in its early stages, and there’s much more development to come.As such, investors and crypto enthusiasts should endeavor to stay abreast of these developments, equipping themselves with the right knowledge to stay afloat amid the wild swings of market volatility.

Grayscale switches CEO following $144 million reduction in fees as Bitcoin outflows finally subsiding

Grayscale Investments, the world’s largest crypto asset manager, announced the appointment of Peter Mintzberg as its new Chief Executive Officer, effective August 15, 2024. Mintzberg will succeed Michael Sonnenshein, who stepped down from the position after a decade with the firm to pursue other interests.During his tenure as CEO, Sonnenshein guided Grayscale from $60 million to approximately $30 billion in assets under management. Notably, Sonnenshein oversaw Grayscale’s historic court victory against the Securities and Exchange Commission, which enabled the firm to uplist the first spot Bitcoin ETF to NYSE Arca.Sonnensheinn led Grayscale Bitcoin Trust to acquire 624,000 BTC before shepherding it through its transition to a spot Bitcoin ETF in January this year. As of his resignation today, Grayscale’s Bitcoin has fallen to 290,000 BTC, although its dollar value decline was limited to $9.6 billion due to Bitcoin’s meteoric price surge from $46,000 to $67,000.With a 1.5% management fee on its Bitcoin, this drop equates to a reduction of roughly $144 million per year in fees for Grayscale. However, with its current assets under management of approximately $19.4 billion, current fee estimates come to around $290 million annually. Over the past few weeks, outflows have begun to subside, with some days of positive inflows into the fund.In a series of posts on X, Sonnenshein expressed his gratitude for his time at Grayscale and thanked the founder and CEO of Digital Currency Group, Barry Silbert, for his partnership over the last ten years. “What we’ve achieved together is nothing short of remarkable,” Sonnenshein wrote, addressing the Grayscale team. Keep building. To the moon 🚀.”Silbert also took to X to announce the leadership change, highlighting Mintzberg’s 20+ years of experience across prominent asset managers, including Goldman Sachs, BlackRock, OppenheimerFunds, and Invesco. “Peter is an exceptional strategic leader with global expertise across the most prominent asset managers, which are critical ingredients as we position Grayscale for its next growth phase,” Silbert said in the press release.Mintzberg joins Grayscale when the crypto asset class is at a critical inflection point. “I’ve long admired Grayscale’s position as the leading crypto asset management firm, and I am honored to join the most talented and pioneering team in the business,” Mintzberg said.In recent weeks, Grayscale has seen a reduction in outflows from its GBTC ETFs, signaling a potential shift in investor sentiment. As the firm continues to expand its future-forward investment product suite, Mintzberg’s appointment is expected to position Grayscale for its next growth phase.Over the last decade, Grayscale has launched nineteen crypto investment products, enabling access to the crypto asset class in a familiar, transparent wrapper. The firm has also served as an educational resource to the investing public, working with policymakers and regulators to bring digital assets further into the regulatory perimeter while growing its business capabilities and best-in-class team.As Grayscale navigates this leadership transition, Chief Financial Officer Edward McGee will assume the role of principal executive officer in the intervening period, responsible for leading the firm until Mintzberg takes the helm in August.Mentioned in this articleLatest Alpha Market Report

Why Bitcoin’s bull run is not over yet, according to key signals - AMBCrypto



The Puell Multiple needs to rise at least three times more before Bitcoin can hit the top.
On-chain data, backed by the MVRV difference, indicated that BTC might surpass $85,000.

Bar the recently concluded week, Bitcoin [BTC] found it hard not to produce a red candlestick in a seven-day timeframe since April. As a result of this, there have been opinions suggesting that the bull run is over.
However, that viewpoint could be invalid considering signals AMBCrypto got from different on-chain metrics. First on the list is Bitcoin’s Puell Multiple.
This metric can give insights into BTC’s valuation by looking at miners’ revenue. Using a 365-day moving average, the Puell Multiple tells if the coin is a cycle top or if there is room for the price to appreciate.
It’s bulls over bears again
Historically, Bitcoin hits the roof of the bull market when the multiple rises past a reading of 3 or more. For example, the metric hit a value of 8.13 before the price of BTC started to plunge.
In 2017, the Puell Multiple reached 6.12 before the bull market was declared void. Fast-forward to 2021, the reading had to hit 3.06 before the capitulation process began.
At press time, the metric, according to Glassnode, was 0.90, indicating that BTC’s price has the potential to move higher.
However, one thing AMBCrypto observed was that the reading dropped from the last one every time the next cycle hit its peak.
Source: Glassnode
Therefore, there is a chance the reading might not surpass 3 before Bitcoin calls it quits. At the same time, this does not imply that the predictions targeting $80,000 and above would not come to pass.
$85,000 is almost a sure bet
Another metric supporting this bias is the Market Value to Realized Value (MVRV) Long/Short Difference.
The idea behind the MVRV Long/Short Difference is to ascertain the value each Bitcoin holder purchased the coin compared to the current price.
If the metric is at 0%, it means that Bitcoin has hit the end of a bear market. On the other hand, Bitcoin hits the end of a bull market when the metric is almost 100% or above it.
From the chart below, Bitcoin’s bear market ended around the 2nd of March 2023. It was around the same period that this bull cycle started.
In 2013, 2017, and 2021, the MVRV Long/Short Difference reached 130%, 87%, and 69% respectively at the top of the cycle. However, the highest the metric has reached this cycle was 41%.
Source: Santiment
With this trend, BTC’s price could likely trade higher than the peak it hit in March. Going by the difference in the metrics of this cycle and 2021, Bitcoin could hit $85,000.

Read Bitcoin’s [BTC] Price Prediction 2024-2025

While the coin can also move higher, the $100,000 prediction being mentioned in many corners might be difficult.
If the price hits the landmark, good for holders. If it does not, it might still sound like a good deal for Bitcoin believers.

Bullish signal: nearly 28,000 BTC left centralized exchanges in 7 days - Crypto Briefing


            
            
                            
            
                            
            
            Bitcoin (BTC) showed a 6.6% recovery in the last seven days, and investors withdrew their BTC holdings from centralized exchanges as a result, according to data aggregator Coinglass. In the last seven days, 27,975.21 BTC left the 20 exchanges tracked by the data platform, roughly $1.9 billion at the time of writing.Coinbase Pro saw the most outflows, with 15,891.79 BTC leaving the exchange focused on seasoned traders. Binance came in second, with investors withdrawing 7669.64 BTC from the exchange in the past week.Crypto outflows from centralized exchanges are commonly seen as a bullish sign, indicating that investors are not inclined to sell their holdings in the short term, possibly awaiting price growth. The total amount of Bitcoin left in centralized exchanges tracked by Coinglass is 1.72 million BTC, the lowest level of 2024 so far. Bitcoin supply at centralized exchanges. Image: CoinglassDespite the week of Bitcoin outflows, Bithumb saw an increase of 1,612.50 BTC in the same period. Gate.io and OKX also saw positive Bitcoin flows to their platforms, registering 381.25 BTC and 345.04 BTC in deposits, respectively.Meanwhile, the Bitcoin-related crypto investment products registered positive flows for the second consecutive week, with $942 million invested in the last week. James Butterfill, head of research at CoinShares, highlighted that the below-expected Consumer Price Index (CPI) result was responsible for this positive change, as the latter three trading days of the week made up 89% of the total flows.Moreover, Bitfinex’s analysts pointed out that new Bitcoin whales accumulated BTC around the $60,000 mark, while long-term holders maintained their positions. The latest edition of the “Bitfinex Alpha” report underscores that this paints a landscape where investors show confidence in BTC’s price.“Even for short-term holders (STH), whose portion of the supply has increased from 19% at the beginning of the year to 26.1% currently has an average cost basis of approximately $61,046, making this an essential level to maintain to avoid triggering sell-offs. This is an important cohort to watch though, as STHs and ETF buyers seem to be quick to sell if prices fall below their acquisition cost.”

Australian Man Pleads Guilty to Promoting BitConnect



                    

An Australian man has admitted his role in promoting cryptocurrency lending services for the now-defunct crypto exchange BitConnect, a notorious entity accused of operating as a Ponzi scheme and defrauding victims of over $2.4 billion before shutting down in 2018.



“Mr. Bigatton provided financial product advice without holding an Australian Financial Services license or authorization to provide financial services about the lending platform,” the Australian Securities and Exchange Commission (ASIC) stated on May 17.




ASIC claimed that John Louis Anthony Bigatton, in his capacity as BitConnect’s national promoter, gave financial product advice on six occasions at different locations across Australia, including four seminars and two social media posts.



“Mr. Bigatton undertook promotional activities for BitConnect and the Lending Platform on social media, at seminars that he hosted at various locations around Australia, and through face-to-face meetings with investors,” ASIC continued.



BitConnect’s lending platform was touted as an investment opportunity, urging investors to purchase BitConnect coin (BCC) through its website. 




Investors could loan BCC for a fixed period in exchange for high interest rates.

Once invested, they had no control over their loans or the ability to withdraw their money until the lending period concluded. 



This structure allegedly allowed the platform to function as a Ponzi scheme, using funds from newer investors to pay returns to earlier investors, as per the United States Internal Revenue Service.




A sentencing hearing is scheduled for July 5.



BitConnect was launched in February 2016, offering a platform and a digital currency, but it ceased operations in January 2018 when its founders disappeared with investors’ money.



In January 2023, the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of California ordered $17 million in restitution for the fraudulent scheme, providing some relief to victims of the BitConnect investment scam.



A group of victims of the BitConnect fraud scheme found some solace when a court mandated they receive a portion of the $17 million restitution.



The whereabouts of founder Satish Kumbhani remain unknown.

AI predicts Bitcoin price for August 1, 2024


After Bitcoin (BTC) opened the week on a greener note, its price ranging around $67,000 and pulling the rest of the cryptocurrency market up with it, artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms envision more bullishness and further advances for the maiden crypto asset in the next few months.
Indeed, Bitcoin has solidified its position above the key support level of $66,000 and then surpassed the next important step at $67,000, triggering confidence and optimism not just in the crypto industry but also from advanced AI forecasting algorithms.
BTC price prediction
Specifically, one of these AI algorithms, which draws on historical BTC trends, technical analysis (TA) indicators, chart patterns, and relevant developments, has projected that Bitcoin could hit the price of $97,264 by August 1, 2024, suggesting an increase of 44.89% from its current values.

Elsewhere, the latest iteration of the OpenAI invention ChatGPT, called GPT-4o, has offered the Bitcoin price prediction for August 1, 2024, with targets between $76,348.50 and $89,108.83, “considering the ongoing market factors and historical trends.”
In the meantime, the recent Anthropic AI model, Claude 3 Opus, is even more optimistic, having provided an estimate for Bitcoin price that suggests it will be trading between $105,072 and $167,808 by August 2024, taking into account Bitcoin post-halving sentiment, exchange-traded funds (ETFs), and more.
As it explained:

“The approval of spot Bitcoin ETFs in early 2024 has led to significant inflows, with BlackRock’s ETF alone accumulating over 16,000 BTC within days of launch. Continued institutional adoption could drive prices higher.”

BTC price analysis
For now, Bitcoin is changing hands at $67,130, which indicates a 0.11% decline in the last 24 hours, but nonetheless an increase of 6.88% across the previous seven days and an accumulated gain of 4.93% over the past month, according to the most recent charts on May 20.

Meanwhile, renowned crypto trading expert Ali Martinez has observed that traders have transacted over 530,000 BTC at the price of $66,250, making it a crucial support level, which, if holds, could send Bitcoin sky high, as he explained in an X post on May 20.

Earlier, pseudonymous expert TradingShot shared insights according to which Bitcoin could reach a whopping $100,000 sometime after July, based on the analysis of Bitcoin’s TA indicators and prevailing bullish sentiment following a significant correction in early May, as Finbold reported on May 18.

All things considered, Bitcoin might, indeed, follow the path set by some of the popular AI platforms, especially if the market retains positive sentiment around the flagship decentralized finance (DeFi) asset, but doing one’s own research is highly important as things in this sector can change overnight.

Solana (SOL) Ready for $200? Enormous Breakthrough Evaluated

Solana has secured a serious breakthrough at $170 and lunged toward $180. With this price recovery, Solana might aim for a $200 price target and reach it in the foreseeable future.The latest price movement has been accompanied by a significant increase in trading volume, indicating strong buying pressure. The surge from $170 to $180 is notable because it overcame a local resistance level, suggesting that bulls are gaining control. This momentum could propel Solana to the much-anticipated $200 mark.A closer look at the chart reveals that Solana has moved above the 50-day and 200-day moving averages, which are critical indicators of a bullish trend. The recent break above these moving averages is a strong signal of an upward trajectory. Furthermore, the Bollinger Bands are widening, indicating increased volatility and the potential for further price gains.SOL/USDT Chart by TradingViewIn addition to technical indicators, on-chain data supports the bullish outlook for Solana. The number of new addresses on the Solana network has been steadily increasing, reflecting growing interest and adoption. According to Hellomoon, the number of new addresses in May 2024 is ascending, suggesting that more users are joining the network.Moreover, the weekly transaction fee breakdown shows a rise in non-vote (priority) fees, indicating higher network usage and demand for transaction processing. This increase in network activity demonstrates the growing utility of Solana's blockchain.However, while the technical and on-chain metrics are encouraging, the market in general is far from euphoria, and the current state of things suggests that Solana and cryptocurrencies alike are unlikely to reach ATHs. Inflows are still far from even this year's top, not to mention 2021's and 2017's bull runs.

The Secret Weapon for Bitcoin Investors in a Bull Run: Covered Strangle


							

Bitcoin investors offered strategy for yield



Covered strangle boosts returns in bull market



Works best in markets with low volatility




10x Research, a financial firm known for its prescient market predictions, has proposed a strategy for Bitcoin investors seeking to augment their returns in the ongoing bull market. The firm recommends that Bitcoin holders consider implementing a “covered strangle” options strategy alongside their existing spot market holdings.



In essence, the covered strangle strategy involves selling an Out-of-The-Money (OTM) call option – a contract granting the buyer the right, but not the obligation, to purchase Bitcoin at a predetermined price (strike price) above the current market price – and an OTM put option – a contract granting the buyer the right, but not the obligation, to sell Bitcoin at a strike price below the current market price.



Crucially, this strategy generates additional income for investors through the premiums received for selling both the call and put options.



In a client note released on Monday, Markus Thielen, founder of 10x Research, outlined his firm’s preferred approach: buying Bitcoin spot, selling a $100,000 strike call, and selling a $50,000 strike put, all with a December 2024 expiry. Thielen explained that selling the call could generate an estimated 11% profit, while the put option could generate an estimated 6% profit.



Moreover, Thielen emphasized that the covered strangle strategy offers investors a two-pronged approach. According to him, the strategy could provide either a 17% downside protection or a 17% increase in potential yield, depending on Bitcoin’s closing price in December.









The covered strangle strategy is typically favored by investors who hold a bullish view of the market. However, it is most effective in gradually rising markets with low implied volatility. Under these conditions, options sellers benefit as the expiry date approaches and the options lose value.



Bitcoin was trading at $66,940 at the time of writing, representing a 1.23% gain on the day. The leading cryptocurrency’s bullish outlook appears to remain intact, having rebounded from support at $61,000 earlier this week.

How Web3 Marketing Changes the Game

Years before anyone used the term “Web3,” Novaes hatched a project that rewarded users for doing everyday tasks, like watching videos or reading the news: Mode Mobile. People liked it. Using a custom smartphone, the “EarnOS” lets you stream music and get paid for it, hence the tagline “turning smartphones into earnphones.” Mode Mobile was named as Deloitte’s #1 fastest growing software company, has over 10 million downloads on the Google Play store, and claims to have helped users earn and save over $250 million. More importantly, the model lets brands reach consumers directly… without forking over rent to Google or Facebook.

Linus Torvalds on Why He Does Not Like Cryptocurrencies | Cryptoglobe


                                
In a recent forum post, renowned Finnish-American software engineer Linus Torvalds, best known for creating the Linux operating system, expressed his skepticism about cryptocurrencies. 



Linus Torvalds is a prominent Finnish-American software engineer best known for creating the Linux operating system. Born on 28 December 1969 in Helsinki, Finland, Torvalds displayed an early interest in computers and programming. He pursued a master’s degree in computer science at the University of Helsinki, where he began working on what would become Linux.



In 1991, Torvalds started developing Linux as a personal project. Initially, it was meant to be a free alternative to MINIX, a Unix-like operating system used for educational purposes. On 25 August 1991, Torvalds announced his project on a Usenet newsgroup, inviting others to contribute. This collaborative approach attracted a community of developers who helped improve and expand the system.



Linux is an open-source operating system, meaning its source code is freely available for anyone to view, modify, and distribute. This philosophy contrasts with proprietary software, where the source code is kept secret. The open-source nature of Linux has contributed to its widespread adoption and adaptation across various platforms and devices, from servers and supercomputers to smartphones and embedded systems.



Torvalds’ creation has significantly impacted the tech industry, fostering the development of numerous distributions or “distros” tailored to different user needs. Some well-known distributions include Ubuntu, Fedora, and Debian. These variations have enabled Linux to thrive in diverse environments, from personal computers to enterprise servers.







            
            

            
            

            
            

        

Beyond Linux, Torvalds has also created other important software projects. One notable example is Git, a distributed version control system developed in 2005. Git has become an essential tool for software development, allowing multiple developers to collaborate on projects efficiently.



Torvalds’ contributions have earned him numerous accolades, including the Millennium Technology Prize in 2012. He remains actively involved in the Linux community, overseeing the development of the Linux kernel, the core component of the operating system. Torvalds’ work has left an indelible mark on the world of technology, exemplifying the power of open-source software and collaborative development.



On May 17, in a post on the Real World Technologies Forums, Torvalds made his stance on cryptocurrencies abundantly clear. The mastermind behind Linux dismissed cryptocurrencies as nothing more than vehicles for scams. He likened them to a Ponzi scheme that thrives on attracting “the next sucker holding the bag.” Torvalds compared the belief in cryptocurrencies to believing in Santa Claus, the tooth fairy, or the Easter bunny, emphasizing his skepticism about their legitimacy and value.



When confronted by a forum user who accused him of misunderstanding cryptocurrencies, Torvalds responded with a pointed rebuttal. He sarcastically invited the user to “mansplain” cryptocurrencies to him but suggested they first educate themselves on blockchains and the use of cryptographic hashes for validating chains of events. Torvalds highlighted that he was involved in significant cryptographic projects well before the advent of Bitcoin. He further implied that the accuser might be one of the “bagholders” trying to offload worthless assets onto others, underscoring his critical view of the cryptocurrency market.

                        BounceBit, a new Bitcoin restaking startup, has announced a detailed roadmap for 2024 aimed at democratizing high-yield Bitcoin investing by merging centralized and decentralized finance (CeDeFi). Backed by Binance, the startup’s ambitious plan involves enhancing infrastructure and introducing new products while maintaining Bitcoin’s core technology.BounceBit Unveils Plans for Bitcoin Democracy By Blending Centralized and Decentralized Infrastructure
In a May 20 Medium blog post, BounceBit revealed in its roadmap, its vision to combine the liquidity and structure of centralized exchanges like Coinbase with decentralized infrastructure for Bitcoin. The company emphasized it would not launch a sidechain or layer-2 solution, distancing itself from recent trends like runes and BRC-20 tokens, which it views as short-term hypes.In April, Binance Labs, Binance’s venture arm, announced its investment in BounceBit. While the deal’s size was not disclosed, Binance Labs’ Yi He highlighted that the startup “unlocks new avenues for Bitcoin’s utilization with the fusion of CeFi and DeFi.” BounceBit’s vision is encapsulated in its CeDeFi framework, which has been operational since its inception a few months ago. This framework merges the security of Centralized Finance (CeFi) with the potential of Decentralized Finance (DeFi). According to the roadmap, BounceBit’s protocol development is divided into three pillars: BounceBit Portal, BounceBit Chain, and BounceClub, each with its own designated roadmap. The startup plans to enhance the BounceBit Chain, a proof-of-stake layer-1 chain secured by validators staking Bitcoin and BounceBit’s native token, BB. This will involve optimizing the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) execution layer to improve node performance. The BounceBit Portal is the operating system that allows easy interaction with the protocol’s products. Planned services include fixed earnings for investors seeking stable returns, over-collateralized lending and borrowing, and additional structured products tailored to investors’ needs.BounceClub will aid users in launching their own CeDeFi products using BounceBit’s widget. BounceBit’s role will include maintaining the whitelist for contract deployment and creating general components, while the official website will provide these components without hosting business logic for Decentralized Applications (DApps).Bitcoin Going Toward A New ATH After $67K Resistance Level
Bitcoin’s price is poised for new all-time highs if it can surpass the critical resistance level of $67,500. Markus Thielen of 10x Research believes that breaking through this level could trigger a bullish rally, especially given Bitcoin’s recent recovery above the $66,000 threshold and a 7.3% growth over the past week. He emphasizes that overcoming $67,500 could validate Bitcoin ETF model projections, driving the cryptocurrency to new highs.Recent trends in the United States show positive inflows for spot Bitcoin ETFs for two consecutive weeks, with over $200 million net inflow. However, this is lower than the previous week’s $413 million. Institutional inflows through ETFs have significantly contributed to Bitcoin’s rally, accounting for 75% of new investments and pushing its price past $50,000. A breakthrough at $67,500 could liquidate nearly $300 million in leveraged short positions, indicating strong bullish momentum.

Blockchain tracker Whale Alert has reported a substantial transfer of 50 million XRP tokens from Ripple Labs Inc. to an unknown wallet, valued at approximately $25.7 million. This transaction follows closely on the heels of another large-scale movement by the payment processing firm just last week, where over 100 million XRP were sent to an external wallet. Ripple, a leading company in the blockchain and cryptocurrency sector, holds a significant portion of the circulating supply of XRP, numbering in the billions. The company periodically sells portions of its holdings to fund its operational activities and support various initiatives within the blockchain ecosystem. These transactions are part of Ripple's broader strategy to manage its cryptocurrency reserves and ensure liquidity for its operations.As expected, the news of these transfers has sparked speculation within the cryptocurrency community, particularly regarding whether these transfers are indicative of Ripple offloading its holdings. Such large-scale movements of XRP tokens often prompt discussions about their potential impact on the market, including the price of XRP itself.XRP's market dynamicsAt the time of the latest transfer, XRP had seen a minor decline of 1.63% over the past 24 hours, with its current trading price hovering around $0.5114. Despite this daily fluctuation, the cryptocurrency has recorded a modest gain of 1.78% over the past week, indicating some stability amid recent market movements.The cryptocurrency market continues to evolve rapidly, and Ripple's strategic decisions regarding its XRP holdings are closely monitored by investors and analysts alike. The timing and scale of these transfers can influence market sentiment and broader trends within the cryptocurrency space.As the community awaits further updates and market responses, the implications of Ripple's recent transactions will likely continue to be a topic of interest, shedding light on the company's ongoing role in the cryptocurrency ecosystem and its impact on XRP's market dynamics.

Ripple Vs. SEC Update: Here’s Why Today Is Incredibly Important To The Lawsuit | Bitcoinist.com


								May 20 is an important day in the long-running legal battle between the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and Ripple. The Commission is expected to file a response to the crypto firm’s motion, which seeks to protect the company’s business interests. 
SEC To File Opposition To Ripple’s Sealing Requests
A court filing shows that the Commission must file its letter brief in opposition to Ripple’s motion to seal by May 20. Ripple had filed the motion on May 13 in line with the scheduling order, which stipulated that date as the deadline for both parties to file a motion to seal any document related to the remedies stage. 

Ripple had revealed in their May 13 filing that they had consulted with the SEC before making the sealing requests. The crypto firm further claimed that the Commission “indicated that they consent to certain of Ripple’s requests, but intend to oppose others.” Therefore, based on that revelation, the Commission will likely agree to some of Ripple’s quests. 
One part that the Commission seems to have consented to is the redaction of the names of some of the firm’s business partners, whose partnership with Ripple hasn’t been officially disclosed. However, Ripple is asking for more than just that as the company seeks to seal the identities of third parties whose identities have no bearing on the outcome of the case. 
The crypto firm has also requested that the court seal or redact certain documents that reflect or show Ripple’s audited financial statements or other financial documents. The company stated that those documents are non-public and disclosing them “would cause significant harm to the company’s business interests and competitive standing.”
Meanwhile, Ripple also seeks to seal or redact information about its confidential business relationships. They argued that the redactions are “narrow” and only relate to “specific financial and pricing terms” that it had negotiated with its business partners. The crypto firm noted that its requests are similar to the proposed redactions that the court granted during the summary judgment.
Joy Is Coming For The Crypto Industry
The cause of Ripple’s legal woes against the SEC has been the lack of regulatory clarity for the crypto industry in the US. However, that is about to change soon enough, as the US Congress will soon vote on the Financial Innovation and Technology for the 21st Century (FIT21) bill, which would provide regulatory clarity for crypto companies. 

If passed, the bill will establish the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) as the primary agency responsible for regulating crypto assets. This will provide a huge turnaround, considering that the SEC has, for the longest time, extended its jurisdiction to all crypto-related matters and sought to clamp down on crypto companies through its enforcement actions.

Grayscale CEO Michael Sonnenshein steps down

Michael Sonnenshein will be stepping down from his role as the CEO of Grayscale Investments LLC.Sonnenshein will be replaced by former Goldman Sachs executive Peter Mintzberg as of Aug 15, according to Barry Silbert, the founder and CEO of Digital Currency Group (DCG), the parent company of Grayscale.Silbert wrote in a May 20 X post:“As we position Grayscale for its next phase of growth, excited to welcome Peter Mintzberg as Grayscale’s CEO, effective August 15. Joining from Goldman Sachs, Peter has 20+ years of experience across prominent asset managers, including BlackRock, OppenheimerFunds & Invesco.”Founded in 2013, Grayscale is among the world’s most prominent cryptocurrency asset management firms, with over $50 billion worth of assets under management as of September 2021.During his 10 years as CEO, Sonnenshein played a pivotal role in the launch of the first United States spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs), according to Silbert, who wrote:“Michael guided the firm through exponential growth & oversaw its pivotal role in bringing spot bitcoin ETFs to market, leading the way for the broader financial industry. We wish him the best in his future endeavors.”Grayscale was among the first spot Bitcoin ETF issuers in the United States. Its Grayscale Bitcoin Trust ETF (GBTC) was converted into an ETF on Jan. 11, while the fund has previously been operating since 2013, making it the first publicly traded Bitcoin fund according to Grayscale.Grayscale’s GBTC is the largest ETF by on-chain Bitcoin investments, currently holding over 287,801 Bitcoin (BTC) worth $19.3 billion, with a 34.9% market share. However, Grayscale also requires investors to pay the highest fee — 1.5%, compared to the industry standard of 0.20% to 0.25%.In comparison, BlackRock’s iShares ETF (IBIT) is the second-largest, holding over 274,000 BTC worth $18.4 billion, with a 33.3% market share, according to Dune.Largest U.S. Bitcoin ETFs.

FLOKI announced on Wednesday that the decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) had voted in favor of burning almost 15.25 billion FLOKI tokens, currently worth just below $3 million.Notably, the decision was reached nearly unanimously.The coins will be burnt this week.The proposal went live on May 13.It noted that the DAO held three key burn-related votes so far.“In each of these cases, the decision of the Floki DAO was swiftly executed, making it clear that Floki is a completely decentralized cryptocurrency and the Floki DAO ultimately determines the direction of the project,” it said.One of the votes focused on burning excess tokens recovered from the blacklisted wallet in July 2022.Some of the affected wallets did not send in the tokens before the deadline. However, one of these recently sent more than 15 billion FLOKI (currently worth over $2.8m million), asking “for a small incentive in return.”The proposal suggested giving the affected wallet 1% of the tokens returned (154,000,000 tokens), hoping to incentivize other affected wallets to send in the excess tokens they currently hold.The excess tokens not returned should be considered burnt and inaccessible, the proposal said. The blacklisted wallets cannot do anything with them except send them to the Floki multisig.FLOKI is down 1.5% over the past 24 hours, currently trading at $0.000196.However, it appreciated nearly 14% over the past week.Meanwhile, FLOKI also recently announced that it’s nearing half a million followers on its CoinMarketCap community page.Notably, Revolut Business recently listed FLOKI, enabling European commercial accounts to invest in the asset.Shina Inu Could Hit $1 by 2050
In other meme coin news, by 2050, SHIB could be worth $1. This would be an excellent development for long-term big bag holders.To reach this conclusion, forecaster Telegaon analyzed factors such as market trends, investor sentiment, trading volume, technological developments, and external influences, it said.Per the analysts’ predictions, SHIB’s max price this year could reach $0.0000601.In 2025, that price could rise to $0.0000728. At the end of this decade, we could see the token reach $0.000712.Over the next few years, it could lose some of those front zeroes.Five years later, we’re looking at a possibility of $0.00216, followed by $0.089 in 2040, and $1.06 in 2050.The average price by 2050 could reach $0.89 and a minimum of $0.62.Source: TelegaonCurrently the 12th coin per market cap, SHIB trades at $0.00002396.It is down 0.3% in a day and up 0.5% in a week.Over the past year, the coin’s price increased by 175%.It hit its all-time high of $0.00008616 in October 2021. SHIB has dropped 72% since.The coin, however, is up a whopping 42,564,577.6% from its all-time low seen in November 2020.

                        The introduction of spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) on U.S. exchanges in January 2024 has significantly influenced the Bitcoin market dynamics. The development has paved the way for institutional investors, who were previously hesitant due to the regulatory ambiguities and the complexities of trading and storing cryptocurrencies, to enter the Bitcoin market in a safe and regulated manner. Amid continued interest in spot ETFs, Bitcoin price hit an all-time high of $73,750 in March 2024.Soon after the launch, Bitcoin spot ETFs drew significant investments. The situation shifted in April and early May when outflows reached more than $1.2 billion. Despite this downturn, the past two weeks have seen a strong recovery, with $1.3 billion flowing back into these ETFs. This recent influx has compensated for April’s losses, bringing their total net gains since launching to approximately $12.3 billion. Total Bitcoin spot ETF net inflow (USD). Source: Coinglass.comPredicting Bitcoin Price with ETF Flows
Recent research by Mieszko Mazur and Efstathios Polyzos examines the effects of these newly established Bitcoin spot ETFs on the price of the leading cryptocurrency. The paper suggests the strong predictive power of net flows to Bitcoin spot ETFs on BTC prices. Per the research, this relationship is so strong that a one standard deviation increase in net flows (about $3 billion) results in a Bitcoin price appreciation of $9,300.Bitcoin ETFs net flows and Bitcoin price. Source: Mieszko Mazur, Efstathios PolyzosAccording to the paper, despite the initial negative net flows causing a decline in Bitcoin prices following the ETFs’ launch, a significant increase in net flows after week 4 led to a rapid price rise, peaking at an all-time high. The study further explores the relationship between Bitcoin price movements and ETF trading volumes. It claims that increases in Bitcoin prices are shown to lead to abnormal trading volumes in the ETFs, highlighting the interconnected nature of price and volume dynamics.Bitcoin Price Returns Generated Outside US Trading Hours
The analysis reveals that 95% of Bitcoin price returns are generated outside of US exchange trading hours. This suggests that significant price movements are driven by market participants who are active outside the ETF trading window, such as international traders and algorithmic trading systems.Bitcoin performance during ETF trading vs. non-trading hours. Source: Mieszko Mazur, Efstathios PolyzosThe finding is in line with an April report from Bloomberg that showed automated trading protocols in Asia react to flow data from US ETFs. According to the report, these trading bots can automatically analyze and react to this data, resulting in buying or selling actions. This pattern of flows helps explain why market returns during Asian trading hours were particularly strong in February and early March but weakened later in March.The impact of algorithmic protocols dumping Bitcoin extends beyond the spot market and affects the derivatives market as well, the report said.“By their very nature, inflows into the ETF structure are “buys” and outflows are “sells,”Abdul Rafay Gadit, CFO and co-founder at decentralized social-investing marketplace Zignaly, told Cryptonews.com. He added that ETFs have a holdings mandate, which includes guidelines on how much of the fund’s assets can be held in different forms such as cash, stocks, bonds, or other securities. “If they can’t hold more than 10%, for example, in cash, inflows would necessitate a buy of BTC,” Gadit said. Similarly, suppose redemptions (outflows) increase the fund’s cash holdings beyond the mandated levels (for example, below an 8% threshold). In that case, the fund must sell some of its Bitcoin holdings to reduce its cash holdings to within the required limits.Impact of Bitcoin ETF Flows on Price “Exaggerated”
Some analysts believe the impact of spot Bitcoin ETF inflows and outflows on Bitcoin’s price has not been necessarily transformative. “The impact of ETF inflows/outflows is slightly exaggerated,” Ruslan Lienkha, chief of markets at cryptocurrency exchange YouHodler, told Cryptonews.com.“Until now, ETFs have played with just a few percent of all Bitcoin free-float; the dependency is likely the opposite. When Bitcoin price rises, it attracts more retail investors to buy BTC ETFs, resulting in inflows; when it falls, retail investors sell ETFs in panic, therefore leading to outflows.”Likewise, a report from The Block suggests that negative investment flows and unfavorable macroeconomic news typically lead to poor price performance in financial markets. Conversely, positive macroeconomic news can mitigate the impact of negative flows, at least temporarily. Therefore, it’s important to monitor investment flows, but they should not be the sole focus, especially for short-term decision-making, according to Teddy Fusaro at Bitwise. “Spot Bitcoin ETF flows are important, but they are just one part of a much larger, dynamic marketplace,” Fusaro told the media.Major US Financial Institutions Buy Spot ETFs
A significant number of major US financial institutions, including banks, investment managers, hedge funds, and professional firms, have embraced spot Bitcoin ETFs in recent months, 13F filings submitted to the SEC show. Data shared by K33 Research, a digital assets investment analysis platform, revealed that as of March 31, 937 professional firms had invested in the spot Bitcoin ETF market.Among the notable investors, Millennium Management, a heavyweight hedge fund, and Susquehanna International Group (SIG), a global quantitative trading firm, reported $2 billion and $1 billion in spot Bitcoin ETF investments, respectively. Bracebridge Capital, a Boston-based hedge fund managing funds for prestigious universities like Yale and Princeton, and Boothbay Fund, a New York-based fund manager, also made significant purchases of ETFs, with investments worth $434 million and $377 million, respectively. Morgan Stanley, a leading U.S. banking firm, and Pine Ridge Advisers, an advisory company, disclosed investments totaling $269 million and $205.8 million, respectively. Additionally, alternative asset manager Aristeia Capital, investment firm Graham Capital, and hedge fund manager Crcm LP reported notable exposures of $163.4 million, $102.6 million, and $96.6 million, respectively, to Bitcoin ETFs.“A majority (52%) of the nation’s largest hedge funds are betting on Bitcoin,” Sam Baker, research analyst at brokerage firm River, wrote on X. “With the introduction of Bitcoin ETFs, institutions have run out of reasons to say no to sound money.”

GameStop Mania: Are Roaring Kitty's Tweets a Hidden Message? - DailyCoin


        

Roaring Kitty returns from an extended social media break, triggering a GameStop stock price surge.



Since returning, Roaring Kitty has been spam-posting countless shorts, leading some to believe a hidden message is contained within.



Others have voiced deep skepticism over Roaring Kitty’s return.




Roaring Kitty, AKA Keith Gill, an influential figure from the 2021 GameStop squeeze, unexpectedly resurfaced on social media this month after nearly three years of silence. Roaring Kitty’s return on May 13 had the effect of reigniting GameStop mania, sending its stock price 160% higher to peak at $64.90 on May 14. 



While GME has sold off significantly since topping, Roaring Kitty’s prolific posting on X has continued unabated. The content posted features a glut of seemingly random film clips, TV show excerpts, and the occasional meme, leading some to believe that the influencer is communicating a hidden message to those with eyes to see.



GameStop Hidden Message



The Roaring Kitty X account has been posting a dizzying array of movie clips and memes since his return on May 13, leading some to believe hidden messages are woven into the posts. There are no obvious consistent themes beyond many shorts being doctored to feature references to cats, GameStop, or mockery of bearish sentiment.




Nonetheless, die-hard GameStop supporters like wallstreetbets have been feverishly attempting to decode what they view as a reverse meme movie unspooling Roaring Kitty’s master plan. The random shorts convinced wallstreetbets to go “balls deep” into GME when trading reopens on Monday.







Others have taken the hidden message theories even further. X influencer Kinky Kong.AI claimed to have noted Morse code within the eye blinks of one of the shared video clips. Software engineer G-OHMie analyzed audio spectrograms and detected the secret message “hang in there” embedded in another Roaring Kitty post accompanied by the iconic hanging cat meme.



While some seek to decipher hidden meanings in the posts, an opposing narrative has emerged, casting doubt on Roaring Kitty’s motivations to lead a reprisal of 2021’s GameStop short squeeze.



Is Roaring Kitty’s Return a CIA Psyop?



Despite the belief that Roaring Kitty has returned to lead investors in a reprisal of 2021’s GameStop short squeeze, others have reacted with intense skepticism toward his resurfacing. Former SEC chair Jay Clayton called for Gill to appear on CNBC to explain his cryptic posting behavior if he truly cares about markets and investing as portrayed. 




However, Clayton also believed that Gill’s actions do not constitute insider trading, as “he is trading on his own information.”



More sinister theories have also emerged, with economist MikeCristo8 alleging that Roaring Kitty is a CIA asset deployed to divert investor capital from gold ahead of an impending “credit event.” Prominent Bitcoin bull Max Keiser echoed these claims, also accusing Gill of being a government operative.



Semi-retired hedge fund founder “₿ΞΞnThereDoneThat Capital” took a different angle, stating that the more Roaring Kitty posts “meaningless videos,” the more he is inclined to believe his Twitter account was sold, and the individual behind the recent deluge of tweets is an impersonator.



On the Flipside




Confirmation bias is the psychological phenomenon of ascribing events to fit a belief, no matter how seemingly obscure or random.



GME closed down 66% on Friday from the May 14 local top.



Retail investors and society in general have felt increasingly disenfranchised by the financial system and elite Wall Street interests.




Why This Matters



While Roaring Kitty’s return’s true intentions remain mysterious, investing calls cannot be made on baffling narratives and vague assumptions drawn from random shorts.

COPA Vs. Wright: Ruling Ends Fake Bitcoin Inventor Saga


								The long-standing legal drama between the Cryptocurrency Open Patent Alliance (COPA) and Dr. Craig Steven Wright concluded today with a definitive ruling from the court. Dr. Wright, who has famously claimed to be Satoshi Nakamoto, the enigmatic creator of Bitcoin, was found to have engaged in extensive and deliberate deception to support his assertion, thus ending one of the most sensational identity claims in the history of technology with a resounding judicial rejection.
The case against Dr. Wright centered on his bold assertion of being the actual person behind the pseudonym Satoshi Nakamoto, who in 2008 introduced Bitcoin to the world through the publication of the white paper followed by the release of the original source code. COPA, representing a consortium of cryptocurrency entities, challenged Wright’s claims, leading to a comprehensive judicial review of his purported evidence and testimonials.
COPA Triumphs Over Fake Bitcoin Inventor
The presiding judge expressed a scathing view of Wright’s testimony, stating that throughout the trial, Wright presented evidence that was “clumsy” in its attempt to deceive. “Dr. Wright is not nearly as clever as he thinks he is,” the judge noted, elaborating that the defendant engaged in a pattern of lies, forgeries, and blaming others for discrepancies and falsehoods exposed during the trial.

“As soon as one lie was exposed, Dr Wright resorted to further lies and evasions. The final destination frequently turned out to be either Dr Wright blaming some other (often unidentified) person for his predicament or what can only be described as incoherent,” the ruling states.
Among the forgeries were documents that Wright presented as proof of his involvement in the creation of Bitcoin, which were later shown to have been altered or fabricated. The judgment highlighted the fact that, despite Wright’s attempts to appear technologically and forensically astute, the forgery attempts were amateurish and easily discernible by experts.
Significantly damaging to Wright’s case was the testimony of Mr. Stefan Matthews, Chairman of nChain Group, who initially supported Wright but whose statements under scrutiny revealed inconsistencies and deliberate falsehoods. The judge pointed out that while Matthews was “more careful in his lies,” his testimony ultimately did not withstand the evidence to the contrary presented by COPA.
Conversely, Pieter Wuille, a well-known developer in the Bitcoin community, provided a witness statement that was deemed by the judge as “the most significant document in this trial.” Wuille’s detailed exposition of the timeline and technical details of Bitcoin’s development was instrumental in debunking Wright’s claims. His testimony, unchallenged by Wright’s defense, provided clear, credible insights into the technical workings of Bitcoin, contrasting sharply with Wright’s fabricated narratives.


The judgment underscored that Dr. Wright’s false claims and the subsequent legal maneuvers constituted a “serious abuse” of the court’s process, not only in the United Kingdom but also in other jurisdictions such as Norway. The court deferred decisions on the specifics of injunctive relief, with further hearings scheduled to discuss the implications of the judgment and the potential corrections to public records concerning the Bitcoin white paper and other documents.

“I am entirely satisfied that Dr Wright lied to the Court extensively and repeatedly. Most of his lies related to the document he had forged which purported to support his claim. All his lies and forged documents were in support of his biggest lie: his claim to be Satoshi Nakamoto,” the judge concluded.
The crypto community has watched the case unfold with keen interest, given its potential implications for the perception of Bitcoin’s origin and the integrity of its foundational documents. BitMEX Research, in a statement, highlighted the ongoing legal considerations about the accessibility of the Bitcoin whitepaper on platforms like Bitcoin.org, noting that future rulings could further clarify these aspects.
In a humorous side note, BitMEX Research remarked, “The ‘key’ evidence from Danielle DeMorgan, Wright’s youngest sister, was that CSW ‘had dressed as a ninja in the local park’. This did not give ‘any credence to Dr Wright’s claim to be Satoshi ‘Who would have thought??”
At press time, BTC traded at $67,047.

Dogwifhat dips, whale invests! What’s next for WIF prices? - AMBCrypto



WIF saw an over 2% increase in value.
A whale has accumulated over 200,000 so far.

dogwifhat [WIF] was one of the biggest losers in the past week, experiencing significant price declines. Despite this downturn, there has been a notable accumulation from a particular wallet, indicating some investor confidence or strategic buying amidst the dip.
Whale accumulates dogwifhat
According to data from Lookonchain, a newly created wallet recently withdrew $1.8 million worth USDC from Coinbase. This wallet then used 606,000 USDC to buy 227,896 dogwifhat at approximately $2.66 per token. 
The accumulation is ongoing, with the wallet still holding about 1.2 million USDC. 
This purchase is notable because WIF had been experiencing significant downtrends over the past seven days, making this trade a bullish move despite the recent declines.
WIF stays in a bear trend
Analysis of the dogwifhat price trend on a daily time frame showed that WIF experienced an uptrend only once in the last seven days. This occurred on 15th May, when the price increased by 9.50% to trade above $3. 
However, it subsequently declined, reaching around $2.50 by 19th May after an almost 1% drop. At the time of this writing, WIF was trading at approximately $2.60, reflecting a 3% increase.
Source: TradingView
Additionally, the Relative Strength Index (RSI) analysis indicated a poor price trend over the past few days. The RSI was below the neutral line, signaling a bearish trend. 
The only time in the past few weeks that WIF was clearly above the neutral line was during the over 9% increase on 15th May. Since then, it has remained below the neutral line.
WIF sees more long liquidations
Analysis of the dogwifhat liquidation trend on Coinglass showed that long positions have experienced more liquidation in the past few days. 
This indicated that traders who were expecting the price of WIF to increase have had their positions wiped out due to the recent price declines. 
Between the 18th and 19th of May, over $2.3 million in long positions were liquidated.
Source: Coinglass

Realistic or not, here’s WIF’s market cap in BTC’s terms

 At the time of this writing, short positions were seeing more liquidations due to the recent uptrend in WIF’s price.
Given that the whale wallet accumulated WIF at around $2.66, a fall below this price range would result in a loss for these holdings.

Bitcoin Retail Investors Are Dumping Amid Jump To $67,000, Why This Is Good For Price


																The Bitcoin price recovery above the $67,000 level has triggered a round of selling, but it is not from the usual camp of large investors selling. This time around, it is the small-time traders who are offloading their bags and putting selling pressure on the price. However, this is not an entirely bad thing given that, historically, such selling has been bullish for the Bitcoin price.
Bitcoin Retail Are Dumping Their Bags
In a report on X (formerly Twitter), the on-chain data tracker Santiment revealed an interesting trend among small-time Bitcoin investors. As the price of Bitcoin rallied past $67,000 over the weekend, these small wallets took this as the time to sell and secure profit.

These wallets are those holding below 0.1 BTC on their balances. This means that at the high end, these wallets are holding an average of $6,000. In the space of one week, Santiment notes that their collective holdings had dropped 0.46%.

Selling among smaller wallets is not new, but at this level, it could have a significant impact on the price. However, compared to when whale and sharks sell their BTC holdings, retail investors selling is usually bullish for the price. This is because as the smaller traders sell, the BTC is picked up by the larger traders, who are usually longer-term holdings.
As blockchain agency Crynet explains in a response to Santiment: “While small traders divesting might seem concerning, it’s often a bullish signal. Historically, this redistribution to larger holders indicates stronger hands in the market. Let’s see how this plays out.”
Bullish Sentiment Rises Among Investors
The selling by small Bitcoin traders comes amid a jump in bullishness. As Santiment reported in a previous post, bullishness among Bitcoin investors has now jumped to a 4-month high. The last time that investors were this bullish was back in January 2024 when the price of BTC had jumped above $45,000.

Bitcoin’s weighted sentiment is now sitting at a value of 0.99, and although this is still lower than its January high of almost 1.8, it remains one of the highest among large caps. Currently, only the Chainlink (LINK) weighted sentiment is higher after rising to a new one-year high of 1.829.

The Ethereum weighted sentiment is currently sitting at a low -0.44, while XRP and Binance’s BNB are sitting at around -0.37. This suggests that bearishness continues to dominate among these assets while crypto investors look to Bitcoin to lead the market.
At the time of writing, the BTC price is still trading at a high price of $66,900. The largest cryptocurrency by market cap is seeing a 6.78% increase in the last week and a small decline of 0.5% in the last day, according to data from Coinmarketcap.

Meme coin trading volume skyrocket despite market turbulence - Crypto Briefing


            
            
                            
            
                            
            
            Meme tokens are defying the typical market downturn behavior, maintaining their position as some of the year’s top performers, according to a report by research firm Kaiko. Despite a recent market correction, these tokens have seen year-to-date returns ranging from 80% to 1,800%. Moreover, meme coin trading volume remains strong, with a more than 200% increase year-to-date, totaling around $11 billion weekly.Image: KaikoThe sustained interest in meme tokens may stem from their adaptability to market trends and accessibility, which continues to draw substantial community engagement, highlights the report. Yet, it’s crucial to acknowledge the higher leverage meme coins carry compared to most altcoins, often fueled by speculative trading.In an interesting twist, the correlation between meme coins and other speculative retail assets, such as meme stocks, has been inconsistent and volatile. For example, the 60-day rolling correlation between DOGE and GameStop (GME) has generally stayed below 0.3 over the past year.Last week, meme stocks like GME and AMC Entertainment saw unexpected gains, which led to a spike in the correlation between DOGE and GME, marking the highest point in over a year.The sudden spike in GME and AMC stock prices is related to the return of RoaringKitty, one of the key figures behind the GME pump seen in late 2020.Image: KaikoCrypto liquidity remains divided among exchanges and assets, with Bitcoin and Ethereum holding the lion’s share. In 2024, Bitcoin’s average daily 1% market depth was over $270 million, dwarfing the liquidity of most top altcoins by more than tenfold. Ethereum followed as the second most liquid asset, with an average market depth of $190 million.However, the landscape is shifting. Altcoin liquidity, in comparison to Bitcoin’s daily market depth, has been on the rise for the past two years. This change aligns with a decrease in Ethereum’s liquidity relative to Bitcoin’s, dropping from 83% in 2022 to 72% in 2024.

Mobs of Bonk Inu Token Traders Now Buying Mollars ICO


                        
                            Mobs of Bonk Inu Token Traders Now Buying Mollars ICO                        
                        

                         Large mobs of Bonk Inu (BONK) token traders appear to be migrating into the ICO for Ethereum-Blockchain’s new store-of-value asset; A rival token for Bitcoin.     Climbing in popularity, Mollars token presale, has raised over $1.35-million-dollars and is still surging.   The brand has become so popular, Google Trends shows it’s gotten 90% of the search volume of already established $BONK.   As that news made headlines over the weekend, a swatch of Bonk Inu holders appear to have migrated over to the Mollars initial coin offering.The report published by Coingape Saturday showed evidence of how the Mollars token rose to a popularity that now rivals Bonk inu.   The data was derived from Google Trends, a public data application that shows statistics on search.  This is used by many to determine how strong or weak a brand has gotten.For Mollars, the Google Trends feature has shown the brand is surging in popularity. Over the last 30 days, there have been moments where the search for the “MOLLARS” keyword term have exploded to over 50x it’s normal rate.Such data proves that the Mollars brand is a cryptocurrency on the rise and perhaps enough to confirm most of the earlier predictions were not high enough.   The top prediction  may have been the most accurate however, a 10,000% ROI yield, suggested on ZyCrypto.Brand Popularity Increases Token Prices
At the time Mollars token prediction, the presale was new and it appears the analyst behind the post had a good foresight on what the project’s popularity would become.  Released in December, the presale was likely under US$100,000 in funds raised as another news report shows the ICO reached $315,000 almost 1 month later.Today, the Mollars token is near its ending deadline of June 1st and raised over $1.35-million-dollars.     It’s estimated thousands of crypto traders have already acquired rights to tokens prior to its launch on crypto exchanges.At least 3 exchanges, with over 20-million users cumulatively, have already confirmed they will list $MOLLARS token on or around June 2nd.Other factors that have since changed and could increase the token’s price predictions are the project developer’s announcement of a new decentralized crypto exchange that will rely on the Mollars token.  Set to launch on the secondary domain of the brand, “Mollars.CC,” it could put the token price into a hyper driven volatility.   And that would also mean, the more people that use this exchange, the further scarce $MOLLARS will become.  This could increase token value massively and rapidly.Bonk Inu & Pepe Trading Volumes TodayAs for another Google Trends that’s been noted, Mollars is half as popular as Pepe ($PEPE) token as well. The popular memecoin is ranked as the 27th most traded cryptocurrency of today.Bonk Inu (BONK), though it’s been better for ROI gains due to volatility in price, is the 61st most traded cryptocurrency today.What is the Market Cap rank now?By market capitalization, Pepe (PEPE)  is rated 26th highest cryptocurrency.  It has an MC of nearly $3.95-billion-dollars.Bonk Inu (BONK) holds the rank of 55th highest.  It has a market cap of $1.64-billion-dollars. The capitalization is a goliath figure considering the token launched barely 2 years ago.Such data can be used to help with future predictions of Mollars.   With the brand being nearly halfway as popular or 90% as popular as the two tokens,  it’s clear there’s a massive audience with interest in the new ERC-20 token.All of these factors are perhaps why the Bonk Inu audience is migrating over into the Mollars presale.  WIth it being just $0.55-cents per token today, the predictions for it to rise between 20x and 100x in value make it seem that it’s a portal to faster gains.What is Mollars token for?
Mollars will be the first Bitcoin-like, store-of-value token on the Ethereum-blockchain with its type of project infrastructure.The total token supply is half that of Bitcoin with only 10-million tokens to be minted.   Forty-percent of that supply is allocated to the presale, with nearly 3-million already bought by investors.The total token supply of Mollars is half that of Bitcoin (BTC), and it has a deflationary feature in its smart contract that’s supposed to help it burn tokens to lower supply over time.Also, once demand rises well above supply, traders will begin referring to their fractional purchases of a Mollars token as a ‘Moll.’  This is the term designated to token holders holding 1/110th of a coin.

                        The Dogecoin price has fallen by 1% in the past 24 hours, dropping to $0.1522 on a disappointing day for the cryptocurrency market as a whole.Despite this drop, DOGE is up by 5.5% in a week, although it does remain down by 9% in the past fortnight and has barely moved in a month.Having said that, Dogecoin has gained by over 100% in a year, and with meme tokens potentially on course for their own season of out-performance, the coin could rally again very soon.Dogecoin Price Prediction as $700 Million Floods In – $1 DOGE Possible in June?
DOGE looks ready to recover after a difficult day yesterday, with the coin’s indicators showing a return of some momentum.After looking like it would fall below the 200-day average (blue), the 30-day average (orange) has flattened and may begin rising again, a sign of incoming gains.Source: TradingViewLikewise, DOGE’s relative strength index (purple) has recovered from 30 yesterday to just over 50 as of writing, with this rise pointing to increased buying pressure.What’s interesting is that DOGE’s trading volume has risen slightly today to $700 million, yet this is still low enough that a big buy from a whale could push the coin’s price up much higher.Yet, at the moment, it seems that whales have been offloading DOGE rather than buying it, which could mean that we may have to wait a few more days for a rebound.A rebound will certainly arrive, however, with Dogecoin remaining highly popular and also remaining in oversold territory.Its biggest long-term hopes reside with Elon Musk and X, which finally switched to the x.com domain last week as part of its transition from a social network to a broader digital platform.Such a transition will also include digital payments, which in turn may include DOGE transfers.If so, there’s no doubt that the Dogecoin price will rocket, potentially breaking its all-time high of $0.7316, which it recorded three years ago now.In the near term, it could reach $0.2 by the end of the summer, with an increasingly bullish market helping it up.The Dogecoin price could rise even higher from September when economists expect the Fed to introduce rate cuts.Alternative Meme Tokens with Strong Fundamentals.
Because DOGE may take some time to really get going, traders may prefer to look at newer meme coins in the meantime.If so, one very promising candidate is WienerAI (WAI), a new Ethereum-based cryptocurrency that has now raised just over $2.3 million in its presale.While it’s very much styled as a meme coin, WienerAI will primarily be a chatbot aimed at helping investors improve their trades and returns.Based around the same generative AI tech that powers ChatGPT, WienerAI will answer queries from traders, helping them pick potential winners and also time their moves.It will also feature two other important functions: an atomic swap capability (so that traders can act quickly on recommendations) and front-running protection, which helps traders make their trades ahead of arbitrage and front-running bots.As a token, it will have a max supply 69 billion tokens, making it deflationary in theory, especially if it attracts rising demand.It will also enable staking, meaning that a big percentage of its overall supply could exit circulation, thereby boosting its price over time.VIDEO Investors can join the coin’s sale by heading over to the official WienerAI website, where 1 WAI is selling for $0.000709.This price will rise by $0.000001 with every stage of the sale up until it ends, at which point it will list – and potentially rally – on exchanges.Buy WAI Today

This Chinese Teen Built A Bitcoin Exchange And Lost Out On $6B When It Got Hacked - Benzinga

Bitcoin Magazine editor Pete Rizzo took to his X account to share the story of Zhao Tong, who created the first-ever crypto margin exchange, Bitcoinica, and ultimately lost 99,000 Bitcoin BTC/USD with its downfall.What Happened: Tong, a 16-year-old Chinese teen, discovered Bitcoin in 2010 and was captivated by the idea of sending money globally. He enthusiastically shared this newfound concept with friends, sparking his deeper involvement in the emerging crypto landscape.Despite challenges like dealing with intermediaries, and enduring the unreliable Mt. Gox exchange of 2011, Zhao continued his efforts and built Bitcoinica in just four days. Unlike other exchanges, Bitcoinica allowed margin trading, enabling users to speculate on future prices. This attracted traders and miners pushing volume to $40 million per month.Also Read: Bitcoin Is Working Its Way Towards This ‘Liquidation Zone’ But There Is One Danger, Trader WarnsThe ProblemZhao’s youthful age and lack of experience raised concerns about the exchange’s security. Despite these reservations, he earned $10,000 (about 2,000 BTC at the time) within the first two weeks.While the year 2011 saw a thriving Bitcoinica, Zhao was overwhelmed with school exams and thus sold the company to Wendon. The new buyer sought to improve security with the help of veteran Bitcoin developers like Amir Taaki.With all efforts in vain, Bitcoinica was hacked in March 2012 losing 43,000 BTC. Subsequent attacks in the same month resulted in an additional 48,000 BTC being stolen. With no hardware wallets or multisig security measures in place, the hackers easily reset passwords to execute the thefts.Early Bitcoin investor Roger Ver reportedly lost over 24,000 BTC in these incidents. In his last act before exiting the industry, Zhao invested 1,000 BTC in a rare solid gold Casascius coin, one of only three in existence, now worth over $60 million.‘Prioritize Security'The precise details of what happened remain a mystery, but Zhao’s takeaway was clear: Bitcoin users and businesses must prioritize security. Zhao’s reputation was tarnished, and his name became synonymous with being cheated and robbed in the crypto community.Exchange hacks, like Bitcoinica’s, highlight the ongoing risks for crypto investors. To mitigate these risks, serious Bitcoin holders are advised to use hardware wallets or multi-sig custody.Today, Bitcoinica serves as a $6 billion lesson in the importance of taking custody seriously and safeguarding assets against potential hacks. It marks the third-largest ever loss in exchange hack.What’s Next: The influence of Bitcoin as an institutional asset class is expected to be thoroughly explored at Benzinga’s upcoming Future of Digital Assets event on Nov. 19.Read Next: Venture Capital Interest In Crypto Revives: $2.4B Poured Into Bitcoin And Crypto Firms In Q1 2024This content was partially produced with the help of AI tools and was reviewed and published by Benzinga editors.Image created using artificial intelligence with Midjourney.

SHIB Burn Party: 410 Trillion Gone, But Price Needs Help


							

Shiba Inu burns millions of SHIB despite price drop



Daily burn rate surges, but weekly volume lags



Over 410 trillion SHIB burned since launch




Shiba Inu’s daily token burn rate has surged despite a recent decline in the price of its native token, SHIB. A recent update on the SHIB burn tracker on X revealed a steep 62.58% increase in the burn rate within the last 24 hours, as the project removes several million SHIB tokens from circulation.







Through this latest burning initiative, the Shiba Inu community has successfully taken 6.9 million SHIB tokens out of circulation. Several transactions stand out among the ten executed thus far. These include burning large quantities of SHIB tokens at various intervals.



In addition to the recent burning of 6.9 million SHIB, the Shiba Inu community has eliminated several more tokens in the past week, bringing the total burned to 57.67 million SHIB over the past seven days. Interestingly, this represents a 57% decrease from the total burned the prior week. Therefore, the significant rise in the daily burn rate has yet to be reflected in the weekly burn volume.









Since its launch as a leading memecoin project in 2020, the Shiba Inu community has successfully burned over 410 trillion SHIB tokens. This leaves only 582.9 trillion SHIB in circulation out of the initial quadrillion tokens created. As of this writing, over 6.28 trillion SHIB remain locked in staking platforms.SHIB was trading for $0.00002393 at the time of writing, attempting to recover from a recent 5.84% price drop, according to data from TradingView.

Top 5 Cryptocurrencies to Watch if the US Federal Reserve Cuts Rates


																TL;DR

The COVID-19 pandemic led to massive economic disruptions, prompting the US government to print trillions of dollars, which resulted in high inflation. 
To counter this, the Federal Reserve raised interest rates to 5.25%- 5.50%.
Lowering rates, on the other hand, could boost investment in numerous cryptocurrencies, with the Fed previously hinting at such a pivot.



Apart from the numerous victims and pressure on the health sector, the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic at the start of 2020 resulted in vacated jobs, uncertainty, isolation, financial instability, and many other setbacks. Amid those gruesome conditions, the US government printed trillions of dollars to support the crippled economy. However, the increased money supply resulted in surging inflation rates and further problems for America’s fiscal policy.
The US Federal Reserve stepped in by enforcing multiple anti-inflationary measures, such as raising interest rates. Between March 2022 and July 2023, the central bank lifted the benchmark 11 consecutive times, with the current level standing at 5.25%-5.50%.
The latest data shows that inflation in the US has cooled off, meaning the Fed might soon pivot from its aggressive regime. In the following lines, we will observe how such a measure might impact the prices of some of the leading cryptocurrencies.




Bitcoin (BTC)
The largest digital asset in terms of market capitalization may significantly benefit once the Fed lowers interest rates. The move would make money borrowing easier, which might translate into increased interest in risk-on assets such as BTC. For its part, the potential flow of fresh capital into the asset can result in a surging price. 
The above is increasingly true now, following the introduction of spot Bitcoin ETFs earlier in 2024. This provides retail investors with familiar and comprehensive financial instruments to receive direct exposure to the price of BTC without having to worry about all the technicalities associated with storing it.
One famous person who believes BTC’s price will take off once the Fed pivots is Mike Novogratz. Until then, he sees the asset trading in the $55,000-$75,000 range.
Solana (SOL)
SOL experienced impressive price growth in the past year, briefly exceeding the $200 mark for the first time since December 2021.
SOL Price, Source: CoinGecko
Currently, the asset trades at around $177 (per CoinGecko’s data), a staggering 780% increase compared to the figure observed in May last year.
Solana’s ecosystem has witnessed significant activity. DefiLlama data shows that the total value locked on Solana stands at over $4.8 billion, while on-chain trading volume has been hovering around $1 billion for the past few months.
Solana is home to many retail investors because of its faster transaction times and cheap fees, creating grounds for potential increases should interest rate cuts start heating up the risk-on market.
Dogecoin (DOGE) and Dogwifhat (WIF)
Meme coins are often the cryptocurrency industry’s most volatile asset in the case of ground-breaking events. The leading asset of that type—Dogecoin (DOGE)—and the sensation built on the Solana blockchain—dogwifhat (WIF)—will definitely be worth watching should the Fed switch its strategy.
Both assets have devoted community bases, receiving support from prominent figures and leading cryptocurrency exchanges, and have been the subject of massive hype. 
DOGE is Tesla CEO Elon Musk’s favorite digital asset. Not long ago, the EV giant officially introduced the token as a payment method. For its part, WIF received backing from BitMEX’s co-founder Arthur Hayes.
Ethereum (ETH)
Another asset worth observing in the event of a Fed pivot is the second-largest by market cap: Ethereum (ETH). Its price has previously spiked following announcements that inflation in the US was cooling off or disclosures that interest rates would remain untouched (instead of raised).
For example, ETH has jumped by almost 10% since May 15 – the day when the US Bureau of Labor Statistics released the latest Consumer Price Index (CPI) data. Recall that total CPI clocked in at 3.4%, which is exactly what the expectations were.

ETH Price, Source: CoinGecko
Polkadot (DOT)
This popular blockchain protocol has completed numerous updates as of late, and as such, is also worth watching in case of increased volatility. Most recently, the team behind it enabled Asynchronous Backing on the network. It is an optimization technique designed to improve the process of parachain block production and inclusion in the Relay chain (the main chain of Polkadot).
Polkadot also unveiled the Join-Accumulate Machine (JAM) Gray Paper. It is a technical upgrade whose goal is to create a more efficient, secure, and scalable blockchain environment that integrates the best aspects of both Polkadot and Ethereum technologies.
Its price has been confined within a very tight range throughout the past few months, which is usually a precursor to considerable volatility. If the Fed decides to cut rates, this volatility might kick in, triggering a considerable move in Polkadot’s price.

Crypto Personality Thomas John Sfraga Pleads Guilty to $1.3 Million Ponzi Scheme



                    

Cryptocurrency personality Thomas John Sfraga has pleaded guilty to wire fraud, admitting to deceiving more than a dozen victims into investing in fictitious ventures, including fraudulent cryptocurrency schemes.



“Sfraga convinced a victim to invest in a fictitious cryptocurrency ‘virtual wallet,’” the United States Department of Justice (DOJ) declared in a May 17 statement. 




The agency elaborated that Sfraga has experience in podcasting and the crypto industry, including hosting crypto events in New York.



“He promised the victims returns on their investments as high as 60% in three months,” the DOJ added. However,



Sfraga was operating a Ponzi scheme, where returns paid to earlier investors came not from legitimate profits but from the investments of new participants.




“In reality, however, Sfraga converted the monies to his own benefit, to pay expenses, and to pay earlier victims and business associates,” the DOJ explained. 



Several of Sfraga’s victims were reportedly friends and neighbors, whose trust he betrayed to “swindle over $1.3 million of their hard-earned savings.”

Such gains are not unusual in the crypto market — Bitcoin rose 65% over three months this year from Jan. 24 to April 24, according to CoinMarketCap data. 




At the time of publication, Bitcoin is trading at $66,860. Several altcoins have seen much larger returns over the same period — Pepe and Dogwifhat (WIF) rose by 722% and 656%, respectively.



This case follows a series of crackdowns on cryptocurrency fraud. 



On May 15, Cointelegraph reported that the DOJ charged brothers Anton Peraire-Bueno and James Pepaire-Bueno with conspiracy to commit wire fraud, wire fraud, and conspiracy to commit money laundering. 



The brothers allegedly obtained $25 million in cryptocurrency in approximately 12 seconds using a scheme that undermined the integrity of the blockchain.



Just a month earlier, on April 4, the former head of legal and compliance for the multibillion-dollar OneCoin fraud scheme was sentenced to four years in jail after admitting she helped launder millions of dollars.

								A popular crypto analyst says that it’s likely Ethereum’s (ETH) time to shine and that its biggest rival is in for a parabolic run.
Pseudonymous trader Inmortal tells his 213,900 followers on the social media platform X that Ethereum will rally and leave many traders on the sidelines.










The analyst lays out an initial target of about $4,000 with a chart suggesting that ETH found support at around the $2,800 level.
“ETH season about to start.
Fueled by disbelief, as all the other times.”

At time of writing, Ethereum is trading for $3,107.
The analyst also has his eye on Ethereum rival Solana (SOL). According to Inmortal, Solana has so far resembled Ethereum’s 2021 market cycle, and if SOL were to continue, it could be trading well above the $360 mark later this year.

SOL is trading at $177.54 at time of writing.
Looking at Bitcoin (BTC), Inmortal says that the crypto king is currently in a range between $74,000 and $56,000. If BTC manages to convincingly hold the $66,000 level, the trader says that another run-up to all-time highs is possible.
“BTC KEY levels.
Price rejected at first level of resistance (mid-range)
> IF price manages to reclaim mid-range, THEN range high ($74,000) is on the table.
> Below blue box = bad
Very simple.”

At time of writing, BTC is trading at $67,024, slightly above Inmortal’s mid-range.

Web3 Marketing Needs Some of Apple’s Secret Sauce

Like spatial computing, Web3 is also an umbrella term, liberally thrown together with terms like blockchain, digital assets, DeFi and the rest of the crypto-jargon dictionary. But most people embedded in the crypto sphere have little grasp of how meaningless these words are to the lay person – and it’s not for a want of understanding their implications.

Gnosis Price Soars 20% After $30Milliopn Buyback Proposal


The price of Gnosis native token, GNO, surged 20% after Thanefield Capital announced a proposed $30 million buyback program.
Holding significant amounts of GNO, this crypto fund plans a large-scale buyback to realign the token’s market value with its intrinsic book value.
$30 Million Buyback Proposal Details

Thanefield Capital proposed that Gnosis DAO deploy $30 million from its treasury over six months. This initiative aims to boost the GNO token’s value, which the fund argues is currently undervalued. According to Thanefield, Gnosis holds $630 million in non-GNO liquid assets and $100 million in venture capital investments. In contrast, GNO’s market capitalization is approximately $424 million, based on its circulating supply of 1.53 million tokens.

The proposal has received preliminary support from the Gnosis community, with 12 out of 14 governance forum voters in favor. Gnosis co-founder Martin Köppelmann endorsed the proposal, emphasizing the need to link the buyback to a growth program.

“I favor this proposal if it connects to a growth program where the GNO acquired in the buyback is consequently used to attract more users,” Köppelmann commented.

If approved, the buyback program will follow a two-pronged strategy. The first approach, the Time-Weighted Average Price (TWAP) strategy, will allocate $15 million to purchase GNO tokens over six months, aiming to exert a daily buy pressure of approximately $83,333. The second approach is discretionary, allocating another $15 million to optimize purchases based on market conditions. Karpatkey, an on-chain asset management project, will manage the buyback.
Gnosis DAO’s Financial Landscape

Gnosis DAO manages various initiatives, including the Gnosis Chain and CoW Protocol. It also has a significant stake in Safe, an Ethereum multisig provider. Despite these assets and previous buyback rounds, GNO’s market value has not reflected these successes. Thanefield Capital noted that long-term GNO holders have not benefited financially from Gnosis DAO’s product developments, venture investments, and treasury management.

As of May 20, approximately 50,000 DAOs collectively hold $30 billion in assets. Gnosis ranks as the 5th largest DAO in terms of treasury size, holding over $630 million in assets, second only to Mantle in non-native marketable tokens.
Since the proposal’s announcement, Gnosis’ token price peaked at $320, a 20% increase, and is currently trading around $308. If implemented, the program could realign GNO’s market value with its intrinsic worth, benefiting long-term holders and enhancing market perception.

Peter Brandt Urges to Ignore Peter Schiff's 'Bitcoin Is Dead' Claim, Half Trillion SHIB Moved in 24 Hours, 7,000 ETH Mysteriously Moved to Robinhood: Crypto News Digest by U.Today


Let’s take a closer look into the past weekend's top three news stories presented to you by U.Today.Legendary trader Peter Brandt reveals what's behind "Bitcoin is dead" claim of Peter SchiffFollowing Bitcoin's recent 9.3% price increase to $67,000, Peter Schiff, seasoned economist known for his critical sentiment toward crypto, took to X platform to share his skepticism regarding the significance of BTC's recovery. Schiff stated that since early April, silver managed to gain more than 21%, while the flagship crypto - only 2% over the same period. He then deemed Bitcoin a failed investment and said it is "dead," claiming that silver offers higher returns. Schiff's statement caught the eye of veteran trader Peter Brandt; he urged to ignore Schiff's comments, arguing that "this type of nonsense" is aimed at attracting attention and followers rather than truly understanding the situation. Brandt believes that Schiff, despite all his criticism, understands the value of crypto, but because of his rooted preferences, would rather support silver. In response, Schiff wrote that he is being honest about his view on BTC. He compared betting on Bitcoin to betting on an "imaginary horse," warning investors against this as they could suffer significant losses.Half trillion Shiba Inu (SHIB) in 24 hours: Is Shiba Inu (SHIB) hiding something?Recent on-chain data demonstrates that over the course of the previous 24 hours, Shiba Inu witnessed another spike of activity on the market, with various entities, including crypto exchanges and whales, actively shifting their SHIB holdings. For instance, 45.01 billion SHIB worth $1.13 million were transferred from one Robinhood hot wallet to another. Also, a Symbolic Capital Partners MEV Bot carried out a number of transactions, each comprising roughly 50 billion SHIB, with values ranging from $1.23 million to $1.26 million per transaction. Likewise, Uniswap experienced significant volume, with transactions of 50.8 billion SHIB ($1.26 million) and 50.4 billion SHIB ($1.23 million) recorded. This increased activity aligns with the on-chain data, revealing that there were 86 large transactions, totaling approximately 1.14 trillion SHIB, in the previous 24 hours. Large transfer volumes and a recent spike in whale transactions could portend a major price change or an imminent breakout. At the moment of writing, SHIB is trading at $0.00002394, down 0.95% over the past 24 hours, per CoinMarketCap.Mysterious 7,000 ETH move to Robinhood as Ethereum tops $3,000According to data provided by Whale Alert crypto tracker, on May 17, an unknown wallet transferred 7,000 ETH worth $21,630,557 to Robinhood. The transaction occurred as Ethereum's price surged over the $3,000 price mark, surpassing the psychological barrier. Market participants have been speculating about the reasons behind this significant shift and its possible effects on the market. The transfer might be a precursor to a more significant market move as investors position themselves ahead of the Ethereum ETF decision. According to another theory, a whale, or large holder, may be using Robinhood's platform for trading or custodial purposes since one of the reasons tokens are moved to exchanges is for sale. A plausible explanation could be that the transfer is meant to bolster liquidity on Robinhood’s platform. Yet, the true reason for the move remains unknown. At press time, Ethereum is changing hands at $3,087, up by 0.38% over the past 24 hours, per CoinMarketCap.

Ethereum clears THIS key hurdle: What’s next for ETH’s price? - AMBCrypto



Ethereum’s price only moved marginally in the last 24 hours. 
Market indicators hinted that Ethereum’s bull rally might resume soon.

Ethereum [ETH] successfully broke above a bullish falling wedge pattern a few days ago. Since then, the king of altcoins has been on track and has earned investors profit. 
If the trend lasts, then ETH has a long way to go. 
Ethereum bulls are slowing down
World Of Charts, a popular crypto analyst, recently posted a tweet highlighting how ETH managed to break out of a falling wedge pattern. 
The token’s price has consolidated inside the pattern since March and finally broke out a few days ago. Since then, ETH seemed to be on the right track, as its price increased by almost 5%. 
However, this gain could just be the beginning, as the breakout has the potential to push ETH’s price by 45%. However, the last few hours showcased less volatility, which somewhat paused ETH’s gaining spree. 
According to CoinMarketCap, ETH’s price only moved up marginally in the last 24 hours. At the time of writing, ETH was trading at $3,131.77 with a market capitalization of over $376 billion. 
To see whether this sluggish 24-hour price action could lead to a price correction, AMBCrypto checked Ethereum’s on-chain metrics. 
Our analysis of CryptoQuant’s data revealed that ETH’s net deposit on exchanges was low compared to the last seven days’ average. 
This meant that selling pressure on ETH was low. Additionally, both its Transfer Volume and Active Addresses remained high, which was an optimistic sign.
Source: CryptoQuant
Troubles still persist for Ethereum
Though the aforementioned metrics looked promising, a few of the others raised concerns. AMBCrypto’s look at Glassnode’s data revealed that ETH’s NVT ratio had increased sharply over the last few days. 
For the uninitiated, the NVT ratio is computed by dividing the market cap by the transferred on-chain volume, measured in USD.
 A rise in the metric meant that ETH was overvalued, which indicated a possible price correction soon.
Source: Glassnode
Apart from this, another key indicator looked bearish. Ethereum’s fear and greed index had a value of 83% at press time, meaning that the market was in an “extreme fear” phase. 
Whenever the metric hits such levels, it suggests that an asset’s price has high chances of dropping.
 Therefore, AMBCrypto planned to check ETH’s daily chart to better understand whether a price correction was around the corner.

The MACD displayed a bullish crossover. Additionally, ETH’s Relative Strength Index (RSI) registered an uptick from the neutral mark. Its Money Flow Index (MFI) also followed a similar trend. 
These indicated that the chances of a major price correction were slim.

Dogecoin Forms Symmetrical Triangle, Rally On The Horizon?


																Amidst a significant surge displayed by Dogecoin (DOGE) recently, popular crypto analyst Crypto Daily Trade Signals has identified a symmetrical triangle pattern in the price movements of the crypto asset, indicating a possible continuation of the present rising trend. Based on the expert analysis, Dogecoin, which has attracted a lot of attention and interest from investors lately, may be preparing to build on its current momentum and make more gains.
Significance Of Dogecoin Symmetrical Triangle Pattern
A symmetrical triangle chart pattern is a consolidation phase that precedes a forced breakout or decline in price. A new bearish trend begins with a breakdown from the lower trend line, while a new bullish trend begins with a breakout from the upper trend line.

According to the analyst, the symmetrical triangle pattern presents a major obstacle for DOGE at the $0.1545 price level. At the same time, the 50-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA) continues to provide support at the $0.1513 level.
Even though the current market price is above the 50 EMA and suggests a bullish bias, Crypto Daily Trade Signals noted that Dogecoin has to surpass the resistance level of $0.1595 in order to confirm that the upward trend is continuing.

This perspective is further strengthened by the Relative Strength Index (RSI), which is currently above the 50 EMA and supports a purchasing trend.
The post read:
Dogecoin has formed a symmetrical triangle pattern, presenting a significant hurdle around the $0.1545 mark. Simultaneously, support persists around the $0.1513 level, reinforced by the 50-day EMA.
The expert highlighted that DOGE is at a pivotal point around $0.15100 on the 4-hour chart, indicating a bullish momentum, and an immediate resistance at the $0.15950 mark. The first obstacle to be cleared is the immediate resistance at $0.15950, which is followed by the $0.16980 and $0.18440 levels.
Although caution is advised if DOGE drops below the pivot point, the RSI’s current position indicates an opportunity for more profits. Thus far, the upward trend is supported by a firm base provided by the 50-day EMA around $0.15130.
Meanwhile, on the negative side, $0.14270 provides immediate support, while $0.13240 and $0.12030 provide additional levels of support, with the RSI at 53, which denotes neutral conditions.
Is $12 DOGE Possible?
Crypto analyst Javin Marks has also shared insights on Dogecoin’s recent price action, predicting a potential massive rally to $12. According to the expert, based on previous breakouts and runs, DOGE has maintained its broken status once more.

These runs have become bigger one after the other, and the last run recorded over 20,000% upsurge. Given the nature of the runs, Javon Marks anticipates the recent run, which might be in its early stage now, to be bigger than the last one.
As a result, the expert experts DOGE to reach $12 or even higher following the run. Also, Marks noted that after the run has concluded, DOGE could see another massive rise of over 7,500%.

                        The Blockchain Association urged a full House floor vote of the Financial Innovation and Technology for the 21st Century Act (FIT21) in a Monday letter to House Speaker Mike Johnson and Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries.Blockchain Association Pushes House Floor Vote For FIT21
FIT21 (also known as H.R. 4763) is expected to be voted on in the chamber sometime this week. Its potential passage in both the House and the Senate would mark the first time the U.S. has seen crypto-oriented regulation.The letter, undersigned by crypto heavyweights including Ripple, Kraken, and Circle, pushes for a House vote on the legislation, citing the need for “legislation that offers a framework for innovation, regulatory clarity for U.S. operators, and protection for users and consumers.”“Since the inception of the Bitcoin network in 2009, the blockchain and digital asset industry has existed without targeted market regulation,” the letter to Jeffries and Johnson read. “The absence of clear rules leads to confusion in the marketplace for companies – and leaves users and consumers unprotected.U.S. Under Fire For Unclear Crypto Regulations
U.S. regulators have been scrutinized for their treatment of the crypto sector. The United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) is often criticized for its regulation-by-enforcement approach.Critics claim that the stringent anti-crypto atmosphere may drive American businesses overseas and stifle the country’s technological advancement.“This lack of clarity impedes innovation and hamstrings companies, harming America’s standing in the global technology race,” the Blockchain Association’s letter continued. “We are seeking pro-innovation and pro-consumer guardrails to ensure a fair and safe marketplace and to safeguard U.S. technological leadership in this cutting edge space.”If passed, FIT21 would see the majority responsibility of digital asset regulation delegated to the Commodities Future Trading Commission (CFTC) while increasing legal protections for consumers of crypto.Congressional Momentum Around Crypto Builds After SAB121 Resolution
News of Monday’s letter comes amid increasing momentum for effective crypto legislation following Congress’ approval of a resolution that would potentially remove the SEC’s controversial accounting bulletin, SAB121, from its guidance.Previously, President Joe Biden alleged that he would ultimately veto the attempt to disavow SAB121, citing “substantial financial instability and market uncertainty” should he sign off on the resolution.The strong bipartisan support against the SEC’s crypto guidance may force Biden to rethink his stance, however.Should Fit21 follow suit, it could signal a new era of digital asset regulation across the United States, with greater freedoms allotted to players in the crypto space.

Two FED Members Talked About Inflation and Interest Rate Cuts: While One Gave a Message of Disappointment, the Other Gave a Date for the First Interest Rate Cut! - Bitcoin Sistemi

While Bitcoin rose after the US data announced last week, the latest inflation data balanced the worsening situation.
Following these economic data, two FED members spoke on the first day of the week.


Making statements about the course of inflation and the FED's monetary policy, Atlanta Fed President Raphael Bostic and Fed Vice President for Supervision Michael Barr evaluated the data.
FED member Bostic spoke first and stated that inflation would eventually reach the 2% target and that it would take some time.





Stating that the FED is not yet in a position to signal a return on interest rates, that is, to reduce them, Bostic stated that when the time comes, they will reduce interest rates, as other major central banks are currently doing.
Highlights from Bostic's statement are as follows:



“Inflation data is very up and down.
My prediction is that inflation will continue to fall this year and next year. But we still have a long way to go when it comes to inflation.
FED is open to all possibilities on the economic path. Our policy stance is restrictive.
The risks are really balanced right now.
As data continues to be volatile, prices will fall at a slower pace than many expect. “It will take a little longer than expected for this downward momentum to be reflected in the economy.”

Finally, Bostic stated that there was no change in the FED's forecast regarding interest policy and said that he expected an interest rate cut in the October-December quarter this year.
Data Disappointing!
After FED member Bostic, Michael Barr also evaluated the inflation data and said that the US inflation data for the first quarter of 2024 was “disappointing”.





Considering these data, Barr stated that the FED still cannot find the evidence it needs to loosen monetary policy, and stated that the FED will continue to wait to reduce interest rates.

“The FED will wait a little longer for the interest rate cuts that the markets are eagerly awaiting. The FED will remain on hold until it becomes clear that inflation will return to 2 percent, which is our final target.
“The Fed's policy is restrictive enough for now, and we'll need to give it some more time for our restrictive policy to continue working.”

                        BitFuFu Inc., a rapidly growing digital asset mining service and cloud-mining provider, announced stellar financial results for the first quarter of 2024. The company’s innovative cloud mining solutions and self-mining operations are firing on all cylinders, propelling revenues and profits.The company reported an impressive 149% year-over-year spike in total revenue to $144.4 million, driven by explosive growth in its cloud-mining solutions and self-mining operations. BitFuFu Cloud-Mining Making the MostTotal revenue skyrocketed 149% year-over-year to $144.4 million, beyond expectations. Profit figures were even more massive as its net income exploded more than 12-fold to $35.3 million, while adjusted EBITDA rocketed up 431% to $49.9 million. The company’s cloud mining drove this phenomenal performance. Revenue from this high-growth segment nearly tripled to $81.5 million as BitFuFu’s user base surged 63.5% to over 321,000 registered miners worldwide. Customers flocked to the platform’s unique ability to purchase hashrate at fixed prices, providing downside protection amid crypto market turbulence.According to CEO Leo Lu, BitFuFu’s “asset-light strategy” underpins these massive synergies by allowing ultra-nimble optimization of mining rigs and hashrate deployment. “Our cloud-mining solutions allow us to reduce revenue volatility…and significantly strengthen cash flow by pre-selling hashrate at a fixed price,” he explained.However, the cloud business was part of BitFuFu’s multifaceted success story last quarter. Its self-mining operations also delivered a blistering 117% revenue jump to $60.1 million. While bitcoin production slipped 11% due to high network difficulty, this decline was overwhelmed by a 70% hashrate increase and a 134% surge in average BTC prices.Combined, these two engines powered a cash hoard of $163.7 million on BitFuFu’s balance sheet by the quarter’s end—more than double the prior period.BitFuFu Listing on NASDAQ
Looking ahead, BitFuFu is doubling down on its unique hybrid model spanning cloud offerings and self-mining. Lu highlighted plans to acquire existing facilities or construct new ones to “optimize our cost structure and capital allocation even further and expand our bottom line.”With a rapidly expanding global footprint of 29 mining sites across three continents, BitFuFu has swiftly transcended its origins and demonstrated incredibly well as Bitmain’s cloud partner. The crypto mining company further bolstered its war chest by raising funds through a NASDAQ listing in March. The company filed an F-4 form with the SEC on December 31 to register its securities for the merger as a foreign private entity, which the SEC declared effective. BitFuFu was listed on the Nasdaq exchange under the ” FUFU ” ticker symbol following its SPAC merger acquisition. It aims for a third-quarter debut with an anticipated enterprise value of nearly $1.5 billion.The F-4 filing revealed strong financials, with BitFuFu reporting $134 million in revenue for the first half of 2023 and an operating hashrate of 15.2 EH/s, though nearly 80% of the hashing power came from miners leased from Bitmain. Bitmain holds a 5% equity stake in BitFuFu and is a significant supplier, with $90 million of BitFuFu’s revenue allocated to Bitmain for miner leasing and hosting fees.As of March 31, 2024, the company held cash, cash equivalents, and digital assets totaling US$163.7 million, up from US$76.0 million on December 31, 2023. This increase is primarily attributed to funds raised from its business combination and NASDAQ listing in March 2024, along with a fair value gain on BTC due to rising BTC prices.

Dog-themed cryptocurrency Shiba Inu (SHIB) faces a critical juncture in its price action. The market is on high alert as a colossal amount of 58 trillion SHIB becomes the center of a fierce tug-of-war between bullish and bearish forces.After several days of attempting to surpass the daily SMA 50 barrier at $0.0000247, Shiba Inu succumbed to bears, retreating to lows of $0.00002352 in today's trading session.At the time of writing, SHIB was down 0.65% in the last 24 hours to $0.000024, suggesting an ongoing battle between bulls and bears.According to IntoTheBlock data, 58.18 trillion SHIB were bought by 57,380 addresses in Shiba Inu's current trading range between $0.000023 and $0.000025 at an average price of $0.000024.This threshold has emerged as a battleground where the short-term trajectory of SHIB's value might be determined. Bulls, optimistic traders betting on the price increase, are rallying to defend this level, hoping to spark a price increase for SHIB price. On the other side, bears, the pessimists of the market, are pushing back, aiming to drive the price down and capitalize on a potential decline.The significance of the 58 trillion SHIB threshold cannot be overstated, representing a point of convergence for market forces and investor sentiment. A strong defense of this level by the bulls could signal renewed confidence in the token's potential, suggesting that SHIB could be gearing up for a price increase.Conversely, if the bears manage to breach this threshold, it could indicate a loss of support for SHIB, potentially leading to a decline in price. Such a scenario would affect the immediate market value of SHIB.In the event of a price rebound, a successful breach of the daily SMA 50 might be needed to kickstart a fresh uptrend for SHIB price, with targets on $0.000032 or even $0.000045. On the other hand, if bears gain the upper hand, Shiba Inu might persist in its current range with support at $0.000018 and $0.00002.

Roaring Kitty Returns: GameStop Up, But Whale Rains on PEPE Parade


							

Meme stocks surge: GME up 50%, PEPE sees smaller gains



GameStop investor “Roaring Kitty” returns, sparking interest



Whale transaction on PEPE raises concerns of price volatility




Meme stocks experienced a resurgence in the last 24 hours, with both GameStop (GME) and Pepe (PEPE) registering notable price movements. GME surged by nearly 50% to $0.007729, accompanied by a trading volume of $84.5 million. PEPE, on the other hand, saw a more modest uptick of 0.26%, reaching $0.000009 with a significantly higher trading volume of $847.5 million.



Renewed interest in GameStop emerged after the return of Keith Gill, a retail investor known online as “The Roaring Kitty,” who played a pivotal role in the company’s stock surge in 2021. Gill’s return to the spotlight rekindled investor interest, prompting some to revisit their investment strategies from the previous year.



For GME, technical indicators present a mixed picture. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) sits at 52.58, suggesting a neutral market sentiment, neither overbought nor oversold. However, the Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) hints at a potential bullish reversal, suggesting that the stock may be oversold and poised for a price increase. Traders should consider both indicators alongside broader market conditions when making investment decisions.

Similarly, PEPE’s RSI of 57.99 also indicates a neutral market position, suggesting that traders should wait for confirmation before making any moves. Notably, PEPE’s MACD value of 0.00000068 suggests a relatively low price level, potentially presenting a buying opportunity as the price rises.







Source: TradingView



However, recent on-chain data for PEPE reveals a potential complication arising from a large transaction. A multi-signature wallet deposited a substantial amount of PEPE tokens, valued at approximately $4.54 million, onto the Binance exchange.



This move, which may be a stop-loss measure, triggered a temporary price dip of 6% for PEPE. The wallet in question has a history of poor trading decisions, having lost nearly $717,000 (approximately 4.69%) in the past two weeks from separate PEPE trades. Historically, large whale transactions have often been associated with sharp price declines when significant quantities of PEPE are moved. This move led to a 6% price drop in PEPE, as this particular whale has a history of poor trading decisions. It lost $717,000 (approximately 4.69%) in the past 15 days from two separate PEPE trades.







Historically, whale transactions have often caused sharp price declines whenever large amounts of PEPE were moved.

Is it better to invest in gold or Bitcoin?


    Both gold and Bitcoin (BTC) have their niche roles in investing. Gold has little practical use besides jewelry and certain specialized electronics, while Bitcoin has virtually none (pun intended). That said, investors still seek them out, primarily as an alternative to fiat currency. Furthermore, both assets have surged recently, setting their respective price records in 2024. However, is it better to invest in gold or Bitcoin? We’ll try to find out in this article. 



Why would anyone invest in gold or Bitcoin?



Now that’s a good question.



Both financial assets remain in an awkward position in today’s economy. While the gold standard was vital to global finances from the 1870s to the 1920s, and gold was used as a currency for millennia, you probably won’t see a vendor accept a piece of gold as payment today.







On the other hand, Bitcoin is a relatively novel asset that promises to replace the current system ruled by excessive centralization and regulation by central banks and governments. It has yet to fulfill that promise, though: despite a growing number of vendors accepting it, the vast majority of the world still conducts business with fiat currencies.



Seemingly in defiance of logic, both assets are experiencing staggering demand, with gold setting a record high of nearly $2,441 on May 20, 2024, and Bitcoin exceeding $73,000 in March 2024.



So, why is that?



Investors perceive gold and Bitcoin as safe-haven financial instruments in the case of a failing dollar or an incoming recession. In fact, both assets remain attractive, particularly because they are “immune” to government interventions. 



Unlike fiat currency, which you can always print more of, both gold and Bitcoin are limited in supply and thus have the potential to act as a hedge against inflation.



Gold and Bitcoin as inflation hedges



Gold has built a reputation for doing well when the economy doesn’t. In fact, gold has historically been used to store value. The logic behind gold’s ability to counter inflation is that investors turn from stocks to gold when the economy is under threat, increasing demand and price. Once the economy recovers, demand for gold falls as investors return to stocks, creating an “inverse” trajectory.



Despite being several millennia younger than its shinier counterpart, Bitcoin has some similarities to gold in this “inverse trajectory” aspect. After all, its supply is similarly finite, and its allure also increases when conventional assets like stocks decline. The COVID-19 pandemic sort of validated this role, as the price of Bitcoin soared during the global crisis and peaked in November 2021. 



Gold vs. Bitcoin



It might seem unfair to compare a commodity almost as old as civilization to a digital currency that gained traction only several years ago. Still, in their competition to occupy the position of the premium hedge against inflation, they show crucial differences that can help us decide which one we prefer.



1. Price volatility



Having thousands of years to stabilize your price tends to favor gold. On the other hand, Bitcoin’s price remains notoriously unstable, as is the price of all cryptocurrencies. 



According to Curvo, in the last ten years, the gold spot price index provided an annual return of 6% on average, with a relatively steady curve on the performance chart.

On the other hand, the same source provides data that shows that Bitcoin returned 63.3% yearly on average for the last decade, but the price varied wildly, with extreme dips and spikes in its price that reflect “crypto winters” and rushes in demand.

As Bitcoin gets further integrated into the global economy, its price will likely grow due to increased demand. While this price appreciation is not relevant to its ability to act as a hedge against inflation, it is definitely attractive to long-term growth investors. 




2. Safety & regulations



As an established commodity and value keeper, gold is impossible to counterfeit. As it is usually stored in banks, it is also extremely difficult to steal. Carrying gold across the border requires permission from the authorities, and you can generally purchase gold from registered dealers and brokers only. Storing physical gold as an investor, however, is not an ideal solution due to safety concerns. 



Bitcoin is similarly hard to counterfeit due to blockchain technology and commonly available ledgers that can track transactions and keep precise records. It remains decentralized and thus easier to make transactions with, but there are no regulatory bodies to ensure customer safety and prevent clandestine activities. In fact, storing Bitcoin is best with dedicated crypto wallets. 



3. Application & utility



Gold has almost no utility outside the jewelry industry and very niche applications, such as in specialized electronics. Therefore, its demand remains tied to its value storage and inflation hedge purposes. This lack of utility suits the fact that its price is independent of economic cycles, but it also means that gold does not benefit from global economic growth. 



Likewise, Bitcoin also has limited utility. It still has no use outside its speculative investment and as a digital currency. That said, several emerging technologies could see more use for Bitcoin, especially within the fintech and decentralized finance (DeFi) domains. There are no guarantees for this, however, and until these technologies fully develop, Bitcoin will likely stick to its current role.



Is it better to invest in gold or Bitcoin – the bottom line



Gold’s historical role has cemented its position as a value storage and a hedge against inflation. On the other hand, Bitcoin will need more exposure to history before its volatility gets low enough and investors’ trust matches that of gold. 



On the plus side, Bitcoin’s volatility leaves room for price appreciation, and in the last ten years, the famous cryptocurrency has provided significant returns for its investors on average. Historical performance of this scale, however, should not be trusted as an indicator of the future. 



Experts still recommend that gold positions in serious investing portfolios be limited to 10% of total portfolio value. If you invest in Bitcoin for similar purposes, a 10% cap could also apply to the cryptocurrency.



Conversely, stocks, particularly the S&P 500 index, are better than either gold, silver, or cryptocurrency and remain the safest hedge against inflation in the long run.  At least until cryptocurrency passes a couple of decades’ test of time and potentially proves otherwise.

In the past 24 hours, Dogecoin (DOGE), the most popular meme cryptocurrency, has been witness to worrying on-chain developments. According to data provided by IntoTheBlock, there has been a notable decline of almost 86% in the Large Holders Inflow metric. This metric tracks the movement of funds into addresses held by large investors, or whales.Large Holders Inflow fell from 428.72 million DOGE to 62.63 million DOGE, equating to approximately $9.45 million. Such a decrease indicates a substantial reduction in buying activity among these major stakeholders. Typically, a decrease in this metric suggests a decrease in purchasing activity, as many large holders tend to acquire assets on centralized exchanges before transferring them to cold storage.Source: IntoTheBlockAdditionally, Large Holders Netflow, which provides insight into the position changes of whales and investors holding over 0.1% of the supply, has seen a significant decline. Last week, it entered positive territory at 411.69 million DOGE but has since fallen to 31.71 million DOGE. This shift in netflow suggests a change in sentiment among large players, potentially indicating reduced positions or selling.What about Dogecoin (DOGE) price?Simultaneously, Dogecoin's price has seen mixed trends over the past day, with a loss of 2.57% recorded yesterday and a further 1.46% decline today. Presently, the cryptocurrency is trading at $0.152 per DOGE.DOGE to USD by CoinMarketCapThe implications of the decrease in whale activity on the price of Dogecoin dynamics are worth noting. Historically, the actions of large holders have had a significant impact on market movements. Therefore, the sudden decline in whale activity could lead to increased market volatility or signal changes in sentiment among institutional investors.

italik Buterin's Insights: Addressing Ethereum's Centralization Risks


Vitalik Buterin, Ethereum’s co-founder, recently addressed key decentralization challenges facing the Ethereum network in a detailed blog post.
Buterin’s insights focus on three critical areas: Miner Extractable Value (MEV), staking complexities, and hardware requirements for running nodes. He emphasized that while concerns about Ethereum’s design are “widely shared,” these issues might be easier to resolve than some suggest.
Mitigating MEV

MEV refers to the profit block producers can gain by reordering, including, or excluding transactions within a block. MEV allows those who produce Ethereum blocks to manipulate transactions for extra profit. 
This manipulation can make the system unfair, giving an advantage to those with more resources and technical know-how. It undermines trust in the network, making it harder for more minor participants to compete. Buterin outlines two primary approaches to mitigate MEV: minimization and quarantining.
MEV minimization reduces unfair value extraction through protocols like CowSwap, promoting fair trading. Encrypted transaction pools (mempools) prevent exploitation by hiding transaction details until they are confirmed. This approach allows all participants, regardless of resources or technical skills, to engage fairly, enhancing trust and decentralization in the network.
Read more: What Is Maximal Extractable Value (MEV)? 

MEV quarantining limits the impact of MEV by separating the roles of validators and block builders through Proposer-Builder Separation (PBS). This setup means that those proposing transactions do not have the power to include them in blocks, reducing the risk of value extraction. Vitalik also suggested that inclusion lists, which mandate certain transactions in a block, could be a solution.

“We need to make the ‘MEV quarantine box’ as small as possible,” Buterin wrote.

Inclusion Lists. Source: ethresear.ch
Ethereum Staking Complexities
Solo staking on Ethereum currently demands a minimum of 32 ETH and significant technical expertise. This requirement leads many to use services like Lido and RocketPool, risking decentralization.
Buterin proposed a few solutions to reduce hardware and data storage needs for nodes. Technologies like Verkle trees and EIP-4444 could reduce storage needs to less than 100 gigabytes, making it feasible for nodes to run on personal devices. He also suggested lowering the 32 ETH minimum for staking.

Ethereum’s co-founder envisions a future where even browser extension wallets could operate nodes. However, he acknowledges the challenge that offloading data storage responsibilities might centralize trust to a few large actors.

“Incorrect answers could lead Ethereum down a path of centralization and ‘re-creating the traditional financial system with extra steps,'” he warned.

Buterin’s call to action is clear: respect Ethereum’s unique properties and continue improving them as the network scales. By addressing MEV, simplifying staking, and reducing node hardware requirements, Ethereum aims to enhance its decentralization and resilience.

Crypto investment inflows soar to $932 million after favorable CPI report

Digital asset investment products inflows jumped by 616% week-on-week to $932 million last week, according to CoinShares’ weekly report.This marks the second consecutive week of inflows this month and a return to the impressive numbers recorded during the early period of this year.James Butterfill, CoinShares’ head of research, explained that the substantial inflows were “an immediate response to the lower-than-expected CPI (Consumer Price Index) report.” He added:“The latter 3 trading days of the week [made] up 89% of the total flows, highlighting our view that Bitcoin prices have recoupled to interest rate expectations.”However, trading volumes remained subdued despite the significant flows. Butterfill wrote:“Despite the pickup in inflows, volumes were only $10.5 billion for the week in comparison to $40 billion in March.”Grayscale sees rare inflow in dominant USThe CoinShares report showed that spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) in the US continued with their impressive numbers, propelling inflows in the country to more than $1 billion last week.Interestingly, Grayscale’s Bitcoin ETF GBTC saw a rare week of inflow, amounting to $18 million during the reporting period.Since the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) approved the ETFs for trading in January, GBTC has recorded substantial outflows totaling more than $16 billion from its “expensive” product as investors exited to cheaper rival options like BlackRock’s IBIT and Fidelity’s FBTC.Meanwhile, the newly launched ETFs in Hong Kong are not drawing investors’ interest as anticipated. According to CoinShares data, approximately $83 million were withdrawn from crypto-related investments in the City-State.Investors dump EthereumLast week, Ethereum-based digital asset products recorded their second consecutive week of outflows, totaling $23 million. This brings the cumulative outflows from ETH this month to $47 million.Butterfill explained that these outflows were caused by the bearish sentiments surrounding the possible approval of a spot Ethereum ETF product in the US. The SEC is expected to decide on the pending Ethereum ETF applications from VanEck and ARK Invest by May 23 and 24.However, industry experts generally agree that the financial regulator’s taciturn stance toward the digital asset makes it unlikely to approve the product.Meanwhile, investors continued to show interest in other altcoin investment options. Solana, Chainlink, and Cardano saw inflows totaling $4.9 million, $3.7 million, and $1.9 million, respectively.Mentioned in this articleLatest Alpha Market Report

Hacker Who Exploited Solana Meme Coin Factory Pump.fun Says He Faces Theft, Conspiracy Charges - Decrypt

The alleged Pump.fun attacker, who stole an estimated $2 million of Solana, claims to have been arrested and charged in relation to the exploit. However, the police do not have a record of any charges matching the time and location the attacker described to Decrypt.Jarett Reginald Dunn (known as Stacc on Twitter) told Decrypt that on Friday, May 17 at around 11:45 p.m., police arrested him not far from the Pump.fun WeWork in Covent Garden, London.He told Decrypt he was charged for “theft from employer for $2 million with conspiracy of another $80 million,” saying the charges were explained to him “over and over.” However, the Metropolitan (MET) Police are unable to find any charges matching this time and location. And, as a matter of policy, the MET Police don’t disclose details about people who were arrested but not charged.Pump.fun is a popular tool that allows users to launch Solana tokens in minutes for only 0.02 SOL ($3). The exploit, executed on Thursday, saw wallet provider Phantom block the site and trading pause across the platform.Within minutes of the attack, Dunn took to Twitter to claim responsibility. He said he was a former Pump.fun employee with a deep disdain for the protocol and that he was not afraid of being imprisoned, especially with his identity being known prior to the attack.Dunn told Decrypt he was been taken to Islington station and held for 20 hours. He claims that he has been released on bail under the conditions that he returns for an interview with the Criminal Investigation Department on Aug 16, as well as refraining from contacting individuals or appearing at locations connected with Pump.fun.The Canadian-national claims that he has now been hospitalized for up to 28 days due to mental health concerns. This came after he raised concerns about his mental health. He told Decrypt that he was then seen by two psychiatrists before being involuntarily hospitalized.“I’ve been hospitalized two of the last three years of my life lol.” Dunn told Decrypt via Twitter DMs, “I am diagnosed [with] schizo-affective bipolar and panic disorder and am medicated ADHD, although no diagnoses. Haven’t had any meds of any kind in about three months.”In the UK, the only way for someone to be removed from the public against their will due to mental health reasons is under Section 136 of the Mental Health Act. It is important to understand that being sectioned under this act is not an arrest, but rather a police power for when a person is in “immediate need of care and control as their behavior is of concern.”Dunn told Decrypt that a number of his phones and MacBooks were seized due to the investigation he says is currently underway. He’s been in touch with Decrypt by using an iPad provided to the hospital where he’s been taken. As a result, he is currently attempting to raise funds to purchase a new phone, laptop, and regain access to his email.In the face of these charges—which have yet to be confirmed by police—Dunn believes that Pump.fun’s case has no legs. That's because the funds were owned by the customers, not the Pump.fun team which, he believes. And that puts him in the clear.Pump.fun did not immediately respond to Decrypt’s request for comment.Edited by Stacy Elliott.Daily Debrief NewsletterStart every day with the top news stories right now, plus original features, a podcast, videos and more.

Three Stocks Most Likely to Hit a $1 Trillion Market Cap in Next 3 Years - Tokenist


					
Neither the author, Tim Fries, nor this website, The Tokenist, provide financial advice. Please consult our website policy prior to making financial decisions.



Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) showed what happens when an established company is agile and quick to follow and push new trends. By supplying high-performance GPUs and harnessing them for ground-breaking AI development, Nvidia cornered another market.



This transition from the discrete GPU market to the infrastructure for generative AI was sufficient to push NVDA stock to the over $1 trillion market cap milestone in May 2023. It only took Nvidia until February 2024 to cross the $2 trillion barrier.



But which other stocks could accomplish the same feat? After all, NVDA shareholders can enjoy 204% returns on a one-year basis alone. Here are some $1 trillion candidates to consider.



Visa (NASDAQ: V)



What Nvidia is for GPUs and AI infrastructure, Visa is for payment processing. It shares a duopoly with MasterCard, while high-growth American Express is in distant third place. As such, investors should view Visa as the main beneficiary in the upcoming transition to digital money.



At the recent Special Meeting on Global Collaboration, Growth and Energy for Development by the World Economic Forum (WEF) in Saudi Arabia, prominent speakers reaffirmed the need to go full digital. 




“We’re probably going to stop calling it the central bank digital currency [CBDC]. It’s going to be a digital form of cash, and at some point in time hopefully we will be able to be 100% digital”



Khalid Humaidan, Governor of the Central Bank of Bahrain (CBB)




Visa has actively participated in this global monetary transition following the company’s development of the CBDC Payment Module. In January 2022, Visa partnered with ConsenSys to connect different CBDC networks with existing payment rails. This makes Visa integral in bridging the ledgers of central banks and delivering the final digital product (wallet) to the end user.



Notwithstanding that trajectory, Visa’s market cap is steadily increasing. In January 2020, it was $413 billion, and it is now $563 billion. By participating in one of the backbones for global payments, V shareholders can rely on safe growth, benefiting from network effects. 



A recent report from ResearchAndMarkets positions the global payments market to grow at a CAGR of 10.5%, forecasted to reach $4.78 trillion by 2029 from $2.64 trillion in 2023. Moreover, Visa returned $12.7 billion to shareholders in 2023 via stock buybacks. This is in addition to offering dividends, presently at 0.74% yield at $2.08 annual payout per share.



At $280.10 per share at press time, V stock is 23% above its 52-week low of $216.14. According to Nasdaq forecasting, the average V price target twelve months ahead is $316.57.





Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (NASDAQ: TSM)



While Nvidia makes specific AI GPUs like A100 and H100, which found themselves across the Magnificent Seven companies, TSMC is the world’s most advanced chip foundry. In other words, TSMC is the layer zero of chip making. 



Although China ramped up its foundry building to circumvent US export controls, its Semiconductor Manufacturing International Corporation (SMIC) is still lagging behind TSMC. Specifically, the US control grid is hampering Chinese efforts to develop cutting-edge tech, such as gate-all-around (GAAFET) transistors.



Moreover, TSMC’s present 3nm FinFET (N3) technology is the most advanced high-volume semiconductor manufacturing technology. By 2026, the company is set to deliver the 1.6nm process. Taking this into account, TSMC’s global market share is likely to increase further from its present dominant position of nearly 60%, according to Counterpoint. 



For comparison, Samsung is in distant second place at 13%. With the help of the CHIPS Act, previously covered Intel (INTC) aims to take Samsung’s place by 2030. TSMC’s market cap is presently at $796 billion, having grown by 67% over one year.



Notwithstanding black swan events, such as military conflict with China over Taiwan, the average TSM price target is $163.11 vs. the current $151.68 per share. This indicates another all-time high for TSM, up from the previous one of $155.58 on May 15th. 



Such a dynamic is reminiscent of Nvidia’s rise, but the Chinese situation is dampening greater investor interest in TSM. 







MicroStrategy (NASDAQ: MSTR)



Perhaps the most clear-cut case for crossing the $1 trillion milestone is Michael Saylor’s MicroStrategy. Aggressively hoarding Bitcoin, at 214,400 BTC as of May 1st, Saylor counts on central banks to further debase fiat currencies, using Bitcoin as an exit strategy.



This is not a surprising conclusion given central banks’ penchant to monetize debt perpetually while governments rack up massive budget deficits. The US national debt is currently at $34.7 trillion and continues accelerating. This makes it exceedingly likely that the Federal Reserve will attempt to inflate away the astronomical/unpayable debt.



People will likely safeguard their wealth with Bitcoin (BTC) as they realize this dynamic. Although there are thousands of cryptocurrencies, Bitcoin stands apart as the most decentralized and most heavily secured owing to the network effect from Bitcoin’s proof-of-work miners.



In turn, MicroStrategy is a proxy for Bitcoin’s market cap rise, having utilized debt to accumulate scarce bitcoins. The company’s market cap is $29.3 billion, rapidly rising from $3.7 billion in May 2023. Considering that Bitcoin ETFs wildly outperformed gold ETFs, with more funds’ allocations likely incoming, even the baseline forecast of $300,000 per BTC by 2026 would bring Bitcoin’s market cap to nearly $6 trillion.

Cryptic Share from Bitcoin Bull Michael Saylor: BTC Predictions? - Bitcoin Sistemi


A new post came from MicroStrategy founder Michael Saylor, who expresses his endless trust in Bitcoin in every post and statement.
The last post of Saylor, who posts about BTC almost every day, led to some speculations in the community.


Saylor said, “Keep your eyes on the prize” in his post. It was seen that the Bitcoin image shared by Saylor had the numbers 69 above it and 98 and 89 below it.
The community stated that the post was an encrypted message and interpreted these figures as the expectations of the famous Bitcoin bull Michael Saylor and could be clues about how high Bitcoin could rise soon.







Bullish Expectations for Bitcoin Are Increasing!
Thinking that Bitcoin will continue the upward trend it started last week, 10X Research founder Markus Thielen claimed in his new report that Bitcoin exceeding $ 67,500 could lead to new ATHs.

UK High Court Judge rules against Craig Wright over Bitcoin copyright claims - CoinJournal



                    

                    The UK High Court has delivered a damning verdict against Craig Wright, a controversial figure claiming to be the elusive creator of Bitcoin, Satoshi Nakamoto.
Judge James Mellor, in a written judgment, asserted that Wright had lied “extensively and repeatedly” throughout the trial, further accusing him of presenting “fabricated” evidence to support his claims.
COPA wins against Craig Wright
Judge Mellor’s ruling serves as a culmination of a protracted legal battle that has spanned several years.
The lawsuit, brought forth by the Crypto Open Patent Alliance (COPA), aimed to challenge Craig Wright’s assertions of ownership over the intellectual rights to Bitcoin’s code and whitepaper.
Wright’s purported attempts to lay claim to these foundational aspects of the cryptocurrency ecosystem have been met with scepticism and legal resistance from various quarters.
Wright’s litigious nature, characterized by numerous lawsuits against developers and individuals critical of his claims, has raised concerns within the Bitcoin community.
However, Mellor acknowledged the adverse impact of Wright’s aggressive legal strategy on Bitcoin developers, stating that Satoshi Nakamoto, known for a collaborative and non-confrontational approach, would unlikely resort to litigation.
Fabrications and forgeries of documents
The judgment highlighted Wright’s alleged fabrications and forgeries of documents on a significant scale, all in support of his central claim to be Satoshi Nakamoto.
The judge characterized Wright’s actions as “clumsy” and underscored the pivotal role these falsehoods played in shaping the trial’s outcome.
COPA, formed with the primary objective of defending the open nature of the cryptocurrency ecosystem, contested Wright’s assertions, arguing that such claims could stifle innovation and deter developers from contributing to the Bitcoin network.
Throughout the trial, evidence emerged casting doubt on the authenticity of Wright’s claims.
Documents submitted by Wright’s defence purportedly supporting his identity as Satoshi Nakamoto were scrutinized, revealing inconsistencies and anomalies.
Fonts that did not exist at the alleged time of their creation and metadata indicating recent document alterations were among the discrepancies cited in Judge Mellor’s judgment.
Perjury charges loom over Craig Wright
The legal saga surrounding Craig Wright has been closely monitored by the cryptocurrency community, given its potential ramifications for the future of Bitcoin and the broader blockchain space.
While Craig Wright has announced on X that he will be appealing the ruling, the ruling represents a significant setback for his ambitions, with the possibility of perjury charges looming over him.
In response to the verdict, COPA hailed the decision as a victory for open innovation and the principles upon which Bitcoin was founded.
The alliance reiterated its commitment to safeguarding the decentralized nature of the cryptocurrency ecosystem, vowing to continue its efforts to protect against unwarranted copyright claims.

Today’s ruling is the result of a concerted and united effort across the entire open source community – from developers, to those who selflessly contributed to funding this important case, to all members of COPA. THANK YOU ALL for the time, dedication and support.  Your efforts…
— COPA (@opencryptoorg) May 20, 2024

As the dust settles on this legal showdown, the broader implications of Judge Mellor’s ruling reverberate across the cryptocurrency landscape.
The verdict not only underscores the importance of transparency and integrity within the community but also serves as a cautionary tale against attempts to monopolize or control foundational elements of decentralized technologies like Bitcoin.

Bitcoin Miners Targeted by Venezuela in Latest Crypto Crackdown - Decrypt

Venezuelan authorities have launched a crackdown on crypto miners in a bid to protect the South American nation’s power grid. In an Instagram post on Friday, the country’s Department of Energy (Spanish acronym: MPPEE) said that it would disconnect all mining operations from the country’s National Electric System (SEN). Miners are needed to help Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies to work as intended. Such operations are often large warehouses full of computers that use a huge amount of energy to mint new digital coins and keep a crypto network secure. However, such operations have come under criticism by lawmakers all over the world for the amount of energy they consume. MPPEE said in its post that the move was being made in a bid to “avoid the high impact on demand” on the grid, and to allow the SEN “to continue offering an efficient and reliable service to all the Venezuelan people.” The post featured a video of authorities raiding what looks like crypto mining operations. Venezuela—which has experienced a devastating economic collapse since 2010—has long suffered problems with its grid. Although the problem isn’t as bad as it was back in 2019, some of the country’s rural areas still experience blackouts.Last September, Venezuelan police raided a prison where inmates were running secret Bitcoin mining operations. And earlier in 2023, the country’s regulator launched a crackdown on miners.Despite this, the country is still keen on using crypto: The state-run oil company, PDVSA,  reportedly wants to use digital asset USDT to exchange for its crude and fuel exports as a way to get around U.S. oil sanctions, Reuters reported last month.Edited by Andrew HaywardDaily Debrief NewsletterStart every day with the top news stories right now, plus original features, a podcast, videos and more.

Binance Revamps Crypto Listings: Focus on Fundamentals, Not Hype


							

 Binance starts initiative against inflated token valuations



Exchange seeks projects with strong fundamentals



Initiative aims to protect retail investors




Binance, the world’s leading cryptocurrency exchange, has unveiled a new initiative aimed at fostering a more balanced and equitable crypto market environment. The exchange seeks to address a growing concern: token launches with excessively high Fully Diluted Valuations (FDVs) and limited initial circulating supplies.



This strategy involves some projects releasing a small number of tokens at launch, creating an illusion of scarcity to inflate the price. These projects often hold a much larger reserve that could be released later, potentially exerting downward pressure on prices for retail investors.



In response, Binance seeks to empower promising small and medium-sized projects with sound fundamentals. The exchange outlined its proactive approach in a recent report titled “Low Float & High FDV: How Did We Get Here?”



Binance is now inviting applications from high-quality teams and projects across various sectors with moderate valuations to participate in its listing programs. These programs encompass direct spot listing, Launchpools, and Mega Drops.



Specifically, Binance is seeking projects that:




Allocate a significant portion of tokens to community users.



Maintain a reasonable token float at Token Generation Events (TGEs).



Limit allocations to non-community users.



Demonstrate a strong product-market fit (PMF).



Possess a self-sustaining business model.



Have a minimum viable product (MVP) in place.



Ideally, showcase innovation in technology or design.




Additionally, Binance prioritizes projects with:




An organic user base.



Sustainable user growth.



A commitment to responsible regulatory and compliance practices.




Potential benefits of this initiative include more justifiable valuations and token allocations, a better alignment with retail investors and the broader community, and increased exposure for promising projects through Binance’s extensive platform.









Binance’s new listing initiative marks a significant step towards fostering a more mature and transparent cryptocurrency market. By prioritizing projects with strong fundamentals and user focus, the exchange aims to curb the prevalence of inflated valuations and safeguard retail investors.

Solana Surges While Rest of Crypto Majors Start Week Flat - The Defiant

Solana has been on a tear this past week, as tokens issued on the blockchain hit new highs.
Crypto markets traded flat on Monday morning, following a strong performance last week driven by positive Exchange Traded Fund (ETF) inflows and macroeconomic indicators. Solana popped as network metrics climb.Bitcoin (BTC) is trading at $67,698, up 1.5% in the last 24 hours. Ether (ETH) is up 2% to $3,125, while Solana (SOL) rose by nearly 6%, according to CoinGecko data.BTC / ETH / SOL PriceInvestors are sitting on the sidelines after a strong week, dominated by macroeconomic developments, according to Ryze Labs. .April’s U.S. CPI print was cooler than expected, coming in at 0.3% month-on-month compared to the market expectation of 0.4%.The slower-than-expected inflation rate “has quelled rumors of a potential rate hike and paves the way for Powell to consider a rate cut in the coming months.”Michael Van de Poppe, CEO of MN Trading, believes Bitcoin is likely to continue moving within its current range, without significant volatility.“I'd rather expect consolidation and slow upwards movements towards the all-time high. The thesis remains the same: Altcoins to outperform in between,” he wrote on X.Data from CryptoQuant indicates that exchange BTC reserves have drastically declined to 1,929,696 BTC as of May 19. This marks a more than 50% decrease from July 2021, which could suggest a reduction in the liquid supply of Bitcoin, implying that investors are moving their holdings off exchanges for long term storage.The exception is Solana, which is up by the most among blockchains with market capitalizations of over $1 billion, after Sui. The Solana network has been on a tear driven by the meme coin craze, with over 20,000 tokens being created on Solana each day, according to data compiled by Step Finance.Bitcoin RallyAccording to Markus Thielen, head of research at 10x Research, Bitcoin could rally only if it breaks the resistance levels of $67,500.“A breakthrough above $67,500 could potentially lead to new all-time highs, a scenario that our Bitcoin ETF model predicts,” he wrote in a note.Data from CoinGlass shows that in the past 24 hours, 48,218 traders were liquidated, with total liquidations amounting to $108.08 million. The largest single liquidation order occurred on OKX, involving an ETH-USD swap valued at $2.91 million.In other news, Michael Sonnenshein is stepping down as the CEO of Grayscale Investments LLC. He will be replaced by Peter Mintzberg, a former Goldman Sachs executive, effective August 15.Crypto Stocks SurgeCrypto stocks saw some gains on Monday. Coinbase is up 0.45%, while MicroStrategy is up 0.98%, reaching $1,600 a share.U.S. stocks showed little change, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average rising 0.1%.

Bitcoin Shrimps Capitulate: The Bullish Sign That BTC Needs?


								On-chain data shows the smallest of the Bitcoin investors, the shrimps, have been selling recently. Here’s what it could mean for the coin.
Bitcoin Total Amount Of Holders Go Down As Retail Investors Exit
According to data from the on-chain analytics firm Santiment, the Total Amount Of Holders metric has registered a decline recently. This indicator keeps track of the total number of addresses on the blockchain that are currently carrying some non-zero balance.

When the value of this metric trends up, it can be a potential sign that adoption of the cryptocurrency is spreading right now. On the other hand, a drop in its value suggests some investors have decided to exit from the asset has they are completely clearing out their wallets.
Now, here is a chart that shows the trend in the Bitcoin Total Amount Of Holders over the last few months:

Looks like the value of the metric has been going down in recent weeks | Source: Santiment on X
As displayed in the above graph, the Bitcoin Total Amount Of Holders has been observing a drawdown recently, implying a net number of investors have been leaving the cryptocurrency.
The latest drawdown in this metric is the steepest it has been since the all-time high (ATH) back in March. It’s possible that the latest recovery above $67,000 is what has enticed these holders into selling.
In the same chart, Santiment has also attached the data for the total amount of Bitcoin supply held by the investors carrying less than 0.1 BTC in their wallets. Such small holders represent a part of the retail investors and are popularly known as the shrimps.
From the graph, it’s visible that the combined holdings of the BTC shrimps has gone down recently, with these small entities offloading 0.46% of their coins in just the past week.
Interestingly, this decline has come alongside the drawdown in the Total Amount of Holders, so it would appear possible that the ones liquidating their wallets have in fact been these small hands.

The retail investors may be thinking that the current price recovery isn’t going to last long, so they could be exiting while they still can at these relatively high prices. The larger entities in the market like the sharks and whales would potentially be picking up these coins, thus growing their holdings even larger.
“Historically, small wallets dumping their coins to larger wallets is an encouraging and bullish sign for BTC,” notes the analytics firm. It now remains to be seen whether this latest trend will indeed end up becoming the bullish spark the asset requires or not.
BTC Price
Bitcoin’s latest surge has meant that the cryptocurrency’s price has now surpassed the $67,000 level for the first time in almost a month. The last time a recovery above this level took place, BTC lost its bullish momentum before long. It’s uncertain whether a similar fate awaits BTC this time as well.

Potential US TikTok buyer plans to decentralize TikTok, could relay on Polkadot parachain

US billionaire Frank McCourt is leading a consortium to acquire TikTok and decentralize it using the Decentralized Social Networking Protocol (DSNP) from Project Liberty.TikTok, boasting over 170 million users, is being pressured by the US government to sell due to national security concerns and purported links to the Chinese government.McCourt’s initiative, termed the “people’s bid,” represents one of several US corporate interests in the platform. He is collaborating with investment bank Guggenheim Securities and law firm Kirkland & Ellis on this venture.In a press statement, McCourt highlighted that the bid aims to empower users by migrating TikTok to an open-source protocol. This move intends to restore control over digital identities and data, offering Americans a significant voice and stake in the web’s future.TikTok meets PolkadotMcCourt’s plan to rebuild TikTok with DSNP will leverage Polkadot parachain social platform Frequency.In November 2022, Frequency secured its position as a parachain on the Polkadot network. According to its website, the parachain was built to “empower individuals to ensure the portability of their content and safeguard their privacy. The protocol enables ownership of digital identity and control over online presence.”McCourt noted that the decentralization move would return control and value to the users while empowering them to participate in the future of the Internet. He commented:“The foundation of our digital infrastructure is broken, and it’s time to fix it… We see this potential acquisition as an incredible opportunity to catalyze an alternative to the current tech model that has colonized the internet.”Additionally, McCourt’s vision for TikTok prioritizes data protection and empowers social media creators by granting them greater control over their data through DSNP. He said:“A new and better version of the internet where individuals are respected and they own and control their identity and their data.”Meanwhile, several Polkadot enthusiasts have welcomed the news, viewing it as proof of the blockchain network’s technological advancements.Latest Alpha Market Report

Gold Soars to New Highs Amid Economic Uncertainty, Rate Cut Expectations - Tokenist


					
Neither the author, Tim Fries, nor this website, The Tokenist, provide financial advice. Please consult our website policy prior to making financial decisions.



Gold prices have been on a remarkable trajectory, reaching new all-time highs recently. The precious metal’s surge can be attributed to a confluence of factors, including geopolitical tensions, concerns about fiat currency stability, and the U.S. Federal Reserve’s expectations of interest rate cuts. As investors seek safe-haven assets amid global economic uncertainty, gold has emerged as a preferred choice.



What Are the Factors Driving the 2024 Gold Rally?



Geopolitical concerns have played a significant role in driving gold prices higher. The recent helicopter crash involving the Iranian president initially spooked traders, highlighting the ongoing tensions in the Middle East. Moreover, the massive borrowing undertaken by governments worldwide has raised concerns about the stability of fiat currencies, further bolstering gold’s appeal as a safer asset than credit instruments. Global credit issues have also contributed to the shift towards gold, with investors viewing short-term dips in gold prices as buying opportunities amid the overall upward momentum.



Expectations of interest rate cuts by the U.S. Federal Reserve have been another key driver of gold’s rally. Lower-than-expected inflation data in the U.S. has suggested a downward trend, fueling speculation about potential rate cuts. This, coupled with steady U.S. Treasury yields and a weakening U.S. Dollar, has created a favorable environment for gold prices to climb. Additionally, global economic factors, such as China’s measures to stabilize its property sector, have contributed to the positive sentiment surrounding gold.





Gold Price Forecast and Market Outlook



Many analysts and financial institutions predict that gold prices will continue their upward trend. In the near term, the $2,500 level is a potential target (preferred by Goldman Sachs), supported by the current bullish momentum and technical indicators. Market volatility and noisy trading sessions are expected to persist, but short-term dips should present buying opportunities for investors looking to capitalize on the bullish trend.



Several global institutions have issued optimistic forecasts for gold prices. Citibank expects gold to reach $3,000 per ounce within the next 6-18 months, while Goldman Sachs forecasts gold prices reaching $2,700 per ounce by year-end, driven by a strong bull market. J.P. Morgan and Morgan Stanley project gold prices to reach $2,500 per ounce by the end of 2024, with the potential to reach $2,700 per ounce in the long term. Due to economic uncertainty and inflation concerns, particularly in major markets like China and India, the demand for gold is expected to remain robust.

OpenAI Pulls 'Horny' ChatGPT Voice, Denies It's a Scarlett Johansson Knockoff - Decrypt

Well, so much for the “Her” jokes. OpenAI, the company behind the latest multimodal language model, GPT-4o, has announced that it is pausing the development of its new voice, called “Sky.” The decision comes amidst a wave of suggestive comments, memes, and comparisons to Scarlett Johansson's AI character in the film “Her,” which prompted the company to debunk any ties to the Hollywood actress."We've heard questions about how we chose the voices in ChatGPT, especially Sky. We are working to pause the use of Sky while we address them," OpenAI stated.OpenAI's Sky voice was unveiled last week as part of the company's efforts to create more human-like and natural conversations with its AI models. The voice was designed to understand and respond to emotional cues, showcasing the advanced capabilities of GPT-4o.However, the demonstration quickly took a different direction, as users began to test the model's boundaries and flirt with the voice. A flurry of tweets described Sky as “flirty,” “sexy,” and “provocative,” with some users joking about having a new girlfriend or feeling seduced by the AI voice.Parallels were drawn to the 2013 Spike Jonze film "Her," featuring Scarlett Johansson as an AI assistant that a lonely writer becomes attached to. The situation escalated with comedy sketches referencing Sky's sultry vocals and apparent resemblance to the actress —a similarity even noted by OpenAI co-founder Andrej KarpathyAnd here’s where things started to get tricky. Johansson has actively opposed training AI models on her likeness, while OpenAI is known for aiming to release models as content-friendly as possible to avoid controversy—to the point of being criticized for “dumbing down” its models, or allegedly fine-tuning them to have a more left-leaning stance. Within days, CEO Sam Altman tweeted about potential changes to Sky, assuring people that the new model was not publicly available.On Sunday, the company apparently put the first nail in Sky’s coffin announcing that it was pausing development. The announcement was accompanied by an official blog post explaining how OpenAI worked with voice actors to select and train its voice models.In the article, the company denied using Johansson's voice as a template for Sky, clarifying that it belonged to an unnamed professional actress who was using her own voice."We worked with industry-leading casting and directing professionals to narrow down over 400 submissions before selecting the five voices ... Each of the voices—Breeze, Cove, Ember, Juniper and Sky—are sampled from voice actors we partnered with to create them.” OpenAI said.“We believe that AI voices should not deliberately mimic a celebrity's distinctive voice—Sky's voice is not an imitation of Scarlett Johansson but belongs to a different professional actress using her own natural speaking voice,” the post notes.OpenAI said it would not reveal the actors’ identities due to privacy reasons. The company also revealed that it plans to introduce additional voices in the future to better match the diverse interests and preferences of users.Probably none of those will flirt with you, though, based on the fallout to Sky.Edited by Andrew HaywardGenerally Intelligent NewsletterA weekly AI journey narrated by Gen, a generative AI model.

House expected to vote on bipartisan crypto market structure bill Wednesday - Blockworks


The House of Representatives is scheduled to vote on a landmark cryptocurrency market structure bill this week. 
The Financial Innovation and Technology for the 21st Century Act, known as the FIT21 Act, is expected to head to the floor for a vote in the House on May 22, according to a person familiar with the matter. 
FIT21 advanced through the House Agriculture and Financial Services Committees last summer before getting the greenlight from the Rules Committee to advance to a vote earlier this month. The bipartisan legislation has 11 co-sponsors, including Democrats Henry Cuellar of Texas, Wiley Nickel of North Carolina and Ritchie Torres of New York. 
The proposed market structure law establishes joint rulemaking powers between the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC). Notably, the bill grants the latter control over digital commodities markets, including exchanges and broker-dealers. 
The legislation also clarifies how digital assets are classified, stating that the existence of an investment contract alone does not make a token a security, a distinction that could impact several pending legal disputes between token issuers and crypto exchanges and the SEC. 
About 70% of all crypto tokens should be classified as commodities rather than securities, the co-sponsors wrote in a fact sheet published alongside the bill. 
While FIT21 managed to survive markup, there has been pushback from some House Democrats, who argue the legislation goes too far to limit SEC power. 
Rep. Jonathan Jackson, D-Ill., last summer proposed an amendment — which never passed — to strike a section of the bill that allows firms who have filed a “notice of intent to register” to be exempt from certain enforcement actions from the SEC. 
“Allowing for ‘intent to register’ before those regulations are completed would be an absolute injustice to our constituents and retail investors,” Jackson said. “This industry needs to be under full-force regulation and oversight.” 
Agriculture Committee Chair Glenn Thompson, R-Penn., countered that the “notice of intent” allows firms who meet requirements for treatment of customer funds, disclosures and records to operate limitedly while the potentially years-long registration approval process plays out. The bill also allows the Commodity and Futures Trading Commission to issue enforcement actions against firms who have completed the “notice of intent” process. 
The Republican majority in the House however, coupled with the expected support of at least some Democrats, mean the bill is likely to pass and make it to the Senate, where its fate is less clear. 
The expected House vote comes days after the US Senate passed another crypto-focused piece of legislation Thursday: Joint Resolution 109, which seeks to invalidate the SEC’s Staff Accounting Bulletin (SAB) 121. 
The resolution now heads to the President’s desk. The Biden Administration said earlier this month the President will veto the legislation.

Vitalik Buterin Shares Rare Ethereum (ETH) Roadmap Update


Vitalik Buterin, creator of Ethereum, recently provided an update on the ETH roadmap, detailing significant progress and upcoming developments for the blockchain network. This follows the recent Dencun upgrade, implemented on March 13, which aims to reduce costs for layer-2 transactions and improve data availability.The Dencun upgrade introduced proto-danksharding, also known as EIP-4844, which allows for the inclusion of data "blobs" in blocks. This upgrade marks a substantial improvement in network efficiency, building on the previous successes of the Merge and Shanghai upgrades.The next in line are The Verge and The Purge upgrades. The first will see the integration of Verkle trees, which will enable stateless clients and reduce the cost of running a node. This change is anticipated to allow for a tenfold increase in the layer-1 gas limit, resulting in cheaper transactions. The latter aims to simplify the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) by removing certain features, such as the SELFDESTRUCT opcode and the 2,300 gas stipend. This simplification will streamline the EVM and enhance its efficiency.Ethereum Roadmap by Vitalik ButerinIn the latest post, Buterin noted that the ban on the SELFDESTRUCT opcode is nearly complete. While the opcode remains for now, its most problematic behavior — editing an unlimited number of storage slots simultaneously — has been addressed with the Dencun upgrade. This adjustment is an important step toward simplifying Ethereum’s protocol and improving its security and performance. These updates highlight Ethereum's ongoing efforts to evolve into a more scalable and efficient blockchain.

Injective, Fantom soar as Bitcoin price surges past $68k - CoinJournal



                    

                    
Injective price rose 10% to above $27.26, while Fantom hit $0.96 after surging 12%.
Gains for the altcoins came as Bitcoin price crossed the $68,000 mark to hit its highest level since April 12.

Bitcoin (BTC) price rose more than 2% in afternoon trading on Monday as bulls broke above $68,000. 
This is the first time that the flagship crypto asset has reached these levels since April 12 – when BTC fell from highs of $69,100.
Injective, Fantom prices surge
As the benchmark cryptocurrency looked towards the $69k mark, a host of altcoins mirrored the upside. Ethereum broke above $3,150, BNB hit $580 and Solana price rose to above $181, notching a 24-hour uptick of nearly 6%.
However, some of the biggest gainers on the day were Injective (INJ) and Fantom (FTM).
According to data from CoinGecko, Injective price was up 10% to $27.26 at the time of writing. Meanwhile, Fantom continued its recent upward momentum with a 12% spike that saw FTM price hit highs of $0.96.
Injective’s 24-hour trading volume rose more than 113% to $121 million, while Fantom’s was up 11% to over $385 million.
Bitcoin price hits highest level in over a month
BTC’s jump to $68,679 on Coinbase saw the leading cryptocurrency reach its highest price level in more than a month.

The sudden spike in the price of Bitcoin comes after the benchmark cryptocurrency bounced sharply following last week’s release of the US Consumer Price Index (CPI) data.
On May 15, BTC price rose more than 8% from lows of $61,539 to highs of $66,480 as stocks rallied amid the softer-than-expected CPI data for April. 
Today’s gains come as the spot Bitcoin ETFs resume sharp inflows after the past few weeks recorded unimpressive numbers.
Analysts at QCP noted last week that the slowing inflation, institutional adoption of Bitcoin and the upcoming US election could provide catalysts for new momentum that takes BTC to above $74k.
As Bitcoin extends gains above the $66k support level, it’s likely a breakout above the $70k area will open a path for bulls to target a new all-time high. 
Before then, crypto analyst Rekt Capital expects a run to the $71,500 area.

Apu Meme Coin Skyrockets on Ethereum, Another Meme Coin Set to Surge with $15M Raised

                        In an unexpected twist, retail investors are flocking back to Ethereum meme coin markets, and new token Apu has exploded on DEX markets.This article will provide an analysis of APU’s current price trends and look to see whether an innovative new meme coin, Dogeverse, represents a more promising investment opportunity at this time.Retail capital returning to Ethereum is a notable shift in market dynamics after months of sustained Solana meme coin dominance, which can be explained largely by a significant decline in the price of ETH gas fees since the Dencun upgrade.This has fuelled improvements in Ethereum activity, with rising interested in ERC-20 meme coins contributing to the recent uptick in volume across the leading proof-of-stake network – ending months of declining volume.Leading the pack today is APU token, which plays on a cross-over between the much beloved Apu Nahasapeemapetilon (the owner of the Kwik-E-Mart on The Simpsons) and the cousin of Pepe the frog – Apu Apustaja.APU Price Analysis: As New Ethereum Meme Coin Basks in Glory, Is This Other Token Next to Pump?
As APU price continues to fight for a second-rally leg, Apu token is currently trading at a market price of $0.00000001682 (representing a 24-hour change of -82%).This comes as part of a significant retracement move, which has seen APU price take a tumble since a sell-off by early backers was triggered at the all-time high of $0.00000028.However, in an optimistic sign, holders have posted bullish divergence above the descendant down trend, and now, with two hours of consolidation teasing the idea of $0.000000015 forming a new support level, things could be set to reverse.Indeed, APU price action now returns to a previously established accumulation zone between $0.000000015 and $0.000000040, providing further weight to the bullish case for APU.Meanwhile, the retracement has also seen APU’s market cap decrease to a more appetizing level at just $13k – this could provide one of the easiest 50x moves on the market today.Yet, with price action near capitulative territory, this is also a high-risk position, especially with 119 holders still yet to make an exit.The order book reflects this predicament, with transactions balanced at 50% buys to 50% sells in the past 6-hours.But while APU offers a super high-risk play, market analysts are honing in on a soon-to-launch multi-chain meme coin as the next viral play.Explore Dogeverse Ahead of Major Tier 1 CEX Listings in Q2 2024
Touted as the “chain traveling Doge,” Dogeverse has multi-chain functionality across major networks like Ethereum, BNB Chain, and Solana making it a versatile contender in the meme coin arena.With 15% of its 200 billion supply up for grabs, early investors stand to gain significantly after the $15M raise.The project’s structure and potential for high returns, including a staggering +582% APY return for stakers, underline its ambitious roadmap.High APY staking has been all the rage recently, and Dogeverse is set to steal all the limelight.Beyond its playful facade, Dogeverse introduces real utility, offering seamless integration across different blockchain environments – this feature not only enhances accessibility but also adds a layer of convenience for investors.Click here to take part in the Dogeverse presale

Trader Says One Crypto Narrative Even Bigger Than AI, Predicts ‘Biggest Altcoin Season Ever’ - The Daily Hodl


								A closely followed crypto trader believes there is a stronger bullish market narrative for digital assets than artificial intelligence (AI) that could send altcoins to new all-time highs (ATHs).
Pseudonymous trader Criptopaul tells his 105,900 followers on the social media platform X that real-world asset (RWA) tokenization has the potential to send altcoins soaring in the current cycle more than the hype around AI.










“In my opinion RWA is still the biggest narrative of this cycle, more than AI, since the RWA concept itself is based on blockchain and is a real financial revolution that has been hypothesized for years and since Ethereum was born. Tokenization.”
The analyst is also predicting a massive breakout for Ethereum (ETH) against Bitcoin (ETH/BTC) which he believes will also signal the beginning of a historic breakout in the broader altcoin market.
“The stars are about to align on ETH/BTC and the biggest altcoin season ever will begin… 
ETH/BTC double bottom. You ready?”



Source: Criptopaul/X



Looking at his weekly chart, the analyst believes that ETH/BTC has printed a bullish double bottom pattern at around the 0.046 BTC ($3,118) level. A double bottom pattern in technical analysis often suggests that an upward trend is coming after a period of decline.
ETH/BTC is trading for 0.0466 BTC ($3,148) at time of writing, up more than 1.4% in the last 24 hours.

Crypto Analyst Sounds Warning Alarm For Potential 50-60% Crash In Chainlink Price, Here’s Why


																Crypto analyst CrediBULL Crypto recently warned that Chainlink (LINK) could experience a 50% to 60% drop in its price. However, based on his explanation, LINK holders may not have cause to worry as such a price drop is part of the crypto token’s growth.
Why Chainlink Will Experience A Price Drop
CrediBULL Crypto explained in an X (formerly Twitter) post that a “50-60% drawdown is normal, natural, and healthy” given that Chainlink has experienced ten months of up only and a 4x rally.” The analyst expects this price drawdown to last about two to three months and suggested that Chainlink could see brief price surges, but that doesn’t invalidate the current bearish trend.

Source: X
In a video posted on his YouTube channel, CrediBULL Crypto further explained why he is so confident in shorting Chainlink. He alluded to the rise in the crypto token’s open interest and claimed that many levered players entered Chainlink on the pump to a major resistance level. He expects that those investors who opened longs will likely begin to close their positions as soon as Bitcoin experiences a pullback and the crypto market starts bleeding again. 
The crypto analyst added that these investors will capitulate at the lows, which will bring Chainlink’s price to the range lows. CrediBULL Crypto claimed that this move will bring LINK back down to $11.96, about a 30% drop from its current price levels. Based on this, he revealed that he will be looking to short Chainlink around $16, which is the likely level for rejection. 
Same Expectations For Meme Coins
CrediBULL Crypto also expects meme coins to experience a significant price drawdown, given the parabolic rally they have enjoyed since the beginning of the year. Meme coins Dogwifhat (WIF) and Pepe (PEPE) have been the most significant year-to-date (YTD) gainers among the top 50 crypto tokens, with price gains of over 1,400% and 500%, respectively. 
The crypto analyst warned that some major meme coins have already seen their tops and will likely experience significant declines. In the YouTube video he posted, he also gave insights into how low Dogecoin, WIF, and Pepe could drop. 

	Related Reading



For Dogecoin, he predicts that the foremost meme coin could drop to as low as $0.10. However, CrediBULL Crypto noted that he can’t short Dogecoin yet because he expects a relief pump to $0.18, the range he is looking to open a short position. 
Meanwhile, he predicts that WIF could drop to as low as $1.6, revealing that he will be looking to short it at $3.90 because he expects the meme coin to enjoy one last push to the upside before dropping to the downside. CrediBULL also predicts a significant price decline for PEPE. He claims the meme coin could experience a drawdown of as much as 60% since it recently hit a new all-time high (ATH).

Cardano Founder Reveals What Will Decide The Winner In The US Presidential Elections | Bitcoinist.com


								Cardano founder, Charles Hoskinson has shed light on the regulatory and political challenges faced by the cryptocurrency industry. Expressing frustration and discontent with the current United States administration, Hoskinson has urged crypto enthusiasts to take a stance against anti-crypto parties who are contesting in the upcoming US presidential elections. 
Cardano Founder Says “Vote Crypto”
In a recent YouTube video, Hoskinson raised concerns regarding the current US administration’s anti-crypto stance. He emphasized a recent policy statement made by US President Joe Biden, who vowed to veto the House of Representatives’ efforts to oppose the United States Securities and Exchange Commission’s (SEC) controversial accounting policy on crypto assets. 

In response to Biden’s anti-crypto policy, Hoskinson criticized it as “garbage,” alleging that the government was intentionally limiting the growth of the crypto industry in America. The Cardano founder noted that countries like China and regions like Europe had been actively nurturing their crypto industry, establishing clear regulations and adopting less hostile policies and regulations toward digital asset advancements  
Expressing disappointment and frustration, Hoskinson voiced concern over the recent actions of the US SEC and the Biden Administration against the digital asset market, asserting that the administration intends to destroy and severely harm the American cryptocurrency industry. The Cardano founder warned against voting for Biden in the upcoming US Presidential elections, encouraging crypto supporters to take a stand against an administration that continuously undermines the evolution and expansion of the crypto industry. 
Additionally, Hoskinson stated that the US administration was systematically obliterating the American’s race and economic potential. He underscored the potential consequences of the administration’s ongoing enforcement actions, warning that the US risked losing its competitive standing globally and facing a grim future characterized by restricted financial options, mounting debts and a weakened economy. 
Concluding his remarks, Hoskinson passionately stated to “vote crypto,” declaring that “a vote for Biden was a vote against the American crypto industry.”
Will 50 Million Crypto Supporters Decide The Next US President?
According to Hoskinson, there are over 50 million cryptocurrency users in the United States and the election of a US President with an anti crypto agenda could negatively impact the development of the crypto industry. 
More importantly, it could destroy the decentralized foundation cryptocurrencies have been built on, potentially limiting the financial autonomy and security of millions of crypto users in the US, and enforcing actions against good actors within the crypto space. 

As of 2022, the adult population of the US stood at 258 million individuals aged 18 years or older. Should 50 million American crypto users vote against Biden in the forthcoming elections, it would signify that 19.38% of the US adult populace opposes him. 
The percentage could wield considerable influence in determining the next President of the US. With the presidential elections scheduled for November 5, contenders like Donald Trump and Robert F. Kennedy, who are crypto advocates, are vying for victory.

Company that fried Red Lobster put shrimp on the blockchain


The seafood company that drove restaurant chain Red Lobster to bankruptcy with a misguided ‘Endless Shrimp’ promotion was previously praised for using blockchain technology to promote sustainable seafood production.
Bangkok-based Thai Union became Red Lobster’s biggest investor in 2020 and subsequently took the decision to make the company’s popular ‘$20 Ultimate Endless Shrimp’ offer a permanent part of its menu. The promotion, which had been running on a limited-time basis for 20 years, was seen as the ideal way to shift the huge amounts of shrimp that Thai Union was catching.
However, a 40% increase in customer traffic saw the chain, which was already struggling due to increased labor costs, falling sales, and the effects of the Covid-19 pandemic, giving away mountains of free shrimp it could ill afford.
As reported by CNN, under the stewardship of a CEO appointed by Thai Union, Red Lobster cut ties with two of its breaded shrimp suppliers, leaving the Bangkok-based seafood giant with an exclusive deal.
This reportedly led to higher costs and went against Red Lobster’s previous approach of choosing its suppliers based on projected demand.
The free shrimp fiasco has reportedly cost Red Lobster somewhere in the region of $11 million.

Thai Union used blockchain to track shrimp
Back in 2020, Thai Union announced that it would be putting shrimp on the blockchain. The company, alongside data analytics company Sea Warden and supply chain traceability firm Wholechain, began piloting the use of satellite imaging for shrimp farming operations.
The idea was that satellite images collected by Sea Warden would generate data that Wholechain could store on the blockchain and allow shrimp farmed by Thai Union to essentially be tracked ‘from farm to fork.’
This, in turn, would provide valuable insights into the sustainability, health, and environmental impacts of Thai Union’s activities and ultimately inform its purchasing and business decisions.

XRP Price Prediction with Ripple Quantum Computing Research


                        
                            XRP Price Prediction as Ripple Backs Quantum Computing Research – Can XRP Hold Above $0.50?

                        The XRP price has raised 0.29% in the past 24 hours, increasing to $0.51073. This comes as the crypto market as a whole has experienced a decline.XRP is now up 2.29% in the past week, indicating a continuation of XRP’s monthly 1.60% price increase.In the past year, the altcoin has seen a modest return of 8.93%, as per TradingView data.This pales in comparison to the returns of major tokens like BTC, ETH, and SOL in the past 12 months. However, it also suggests that XRP could see above-average gains later in the year.This recent price action follows Ripple’s backing of quantum-resistant cryptographic systems, which may boost future XRP price action.Can XRP Hold Above 0.50?
XRP’s chart is looking promising today, with the coin looking ready to post some more gains after dipping a little overnight.The altcoin is approaching a retest of the $0.5005 support level (yellow), which has continued to hold XRP price above $0.50.Breaking through this level decisively could lead to a continued decline in price.Other indicators argue against this, with XRP’s relative strength index (RSI) rebounding towards 50, up from a low of 25 earlier this morning. This suggests that the recent price decline was temporary and does not signal a complete shift in momentum.Additionally, the altcoin’s 30-day moving average (orange) is trending downward and nearing a crossover with the 200-day average (blue), having dipped below it earlier in the day. This suggests that XRP is currently oversold.The coin’s 24-hour trading volume has also risen in recent days, with its move up 76% to $827,803,541. This confirms increased interest in XRP among investors.Several factors contribute to optimism about XRP’s price, including the broader market’s upward trend following a slowdown in March.While technical indicators suggest positive short-term price movements, sustainable long-term growth will likely hinge on fundamental factors.How Does Quantum Computing Research Contribute?
Ripple’s renewed investment in the research and development of quantum-resistant cryptographic systems could drive future price action.Professor Massimiliano Sala, from Ripple’s University Blockchain Research Initiative (UBRI), highlighted quantum challenges in blockchain technologies in a Ripple Insight article.Professor Sala emphasizes the critical vulnerabilities that quantum computing introduces to blockchain security in its potential to “undermine the mechanisms that protect users’ assets on blockchain platforms.”Given that cryptography forms the fundamental backbone of blockchain technology, readiness is critical in the developing era of quantum computing. Sala added:“While quantum threats may not be immediate, their probability is significant, necessitating proactive measures.”Ripple is pioneering quantum-resistant cryptographic methods through research. Success could strengthen Ripple’s XRP Ledger (XRPL), providing a strategic advantage in the broader industry with enhanced platform security.This advantage might increase XRPL adoption for future-proofing operations from the looming quantum threat, benefiting the blockchain’s native token XRP.Adoption is something that has significantly hindered XRP price movement since 2022. The long-running Ripple-SEC lawsuit has caused regulatory uncertainty that has slowed institutional adoption.However, the Ripple-SEC case is now in the final settlement phase. Ripple may face a settlement fine as high as $2 billion, yet the upshot of such a penalty is that it will draw a line in the sand and enable the firm to continue growing.Coupled with a strengthened platform, it could restore confidence in Ripple as a major player in the crypto industry.In the long run, this points to a rising XRP price, which could reach $1 by the close of 2024.While XRP is set to perform well in the long term, some traders are stacking this meme coin that is packed with potential.High-Potential Meme Tokens Could Bring Bigger Gains
Indeed, the issue with XRP is that because it’s a coin that rests more on fundamentals than hype, it may take a while to enjoy some properly big returns.However, traders looking for quicker and bigger gains may do well to investigate some of the newer meme tokens that are currently doing the rounds.Sealana’s presale is in its final phase and will be ending soon, with investors having rushed to buy its token with over $2 million raised so far.This quick inflow suggests that whales are already diving into the project.Although SEAL is built on Solana, anyone with SOL, ETH or BNB in their wallets can purchase it now at a presale price of $0.022 per token.Sealana is at the forefront of a new wave of meme coins that are helping the Solana network challenge Ethereum’s dominance as the go-to blockchain for viral meme coins.Sealana comes off the back of wildly successful predecessors DogWifHat ($WIF), Bonk ($BONK), Book of Meme ($BOME) and Popcat ($POPCAT), all of which quickly rose to become  top ten meme coins by market capitalization.Follow the latest developments on Sealana’s X account.Buy Sealana Here

Bitcoin Holds Ground Above $68,000 Despite Small Traders' Sell-Off ⋆ ZyCrypto

&nbsp

&nbsp
Bitcoin continued its ascent on Monday, building upon its impressive momentum from the preceding week when it reached a peak of $68,203. Despite undergoing a period of consolidation within a channel since mid-March, the main trend remains particularly bullish.



On Monday, popular cryptocurrency analytics platform Santiment underscored Bitcoin’s resilience. They observed that this activity could be considered a positive sign while smaller traders have been shedding their holdings amidst the recent price surge.



“Bitcoin is maintaining levels just above $66,100 as smaller traders persist in liquidating their holdings despite the crypto rebound over the past week. Historically, the transfer of coins from smaller to larger wallets signifies an encouraging and bullish trend for $BTC,” Santiment tweeted.







Adding to this optimistic sentiment is Axel Adler, a crypto analyst at Cryptoquant, who observed that entities possessing over 1,000 Bitcoins have been accumulating and refraining from selling, anticipating an upswing in value.







“The current 30-day average is 641 BTC. Whales are unwilling to sell their coins as they anticipate a rise in value,” the analyst added.

&nbsp



Andler further noted that investors holding Bitcoin for 1-3 months have exited unrealized losses. He also noted that the MVRV for this timeframe has turned positive at $66,500. Looking ahead, he emphasized that $70,000 remains a crucial resistance level to watch.



Elsewhere, analyst Sonny Mulder also expressed optimism about the continuation of the uptrend. “Seems like it’s gearing up for another upward move soon,” Mulder tweeted. “The retracement to $50k appears less likely now, given that the last low was invalidated by a higher high… We must adjust our course and recognize the low at $56K as the more probable bottom unless we dip below our Wyckoff accumulation structure at approximately $61K.”



Another analyst, “DrProfitCrypto,” also pointed out that he anticipates that a breach above $70,000 will incite the initial wave of FOMO (fear of missing out) among investors, followed by another surge at $74,000. With ongoing institutional inflows and robust technical indicators, DrProfitCrypto set Bitcoin’s next target within the $82,000-$88,000 range.



Bitcoin traded at $68,288 at press time, reflecting a 2.25% increase over the past 24 hours. Notably, popular crypto analyst Ali Martinez noted the significance of over 530,000 $BTC transacted at $66,250, marking a crucial support level. According to him, Bitcoin has strong potential for further gains if it holds.

                        As cryptocurrency markets push higher on Monday, with Bitcoin (BTC) surpassing $68,000 as traders look ahead of this week’s Fed meeting minutes release, Nvidia earnings and the SEC’s decision on spot Ethereum ETFs, investors are hunting for the best crypto to buy now that might hand them quick gains.While upcoming risk events could scupper sentiment, crypto markets maintain strong momentum amid macro tailwinds and following technical breakouts.Bitcoin just pushed convincingly above late-April highs. Back above all of its major moving averages, the next upside target for Bitcoin is its April highs at $72,800.Bitcoin could soon return to $72,800, making it potentially the best crypto to buy now. Source: TradingViewkHaving found support at its 2024 uptrend, Ether (ETH), meanwhile, is looking to break above key resistance around $3,150-3,200.That could open the door to a quick run higher towards $3,700.Source: TradingViewSolana (SOL), meanwhile, has been enjoying strong momentum ever since breaking out of its mid-April to mid-May $120-$160 range. A return above $200 in the near future is very likely.While blue-chip cryptocurrencies look set to do very well in the short term, some impatient traders are hunting even faster gains.Smaller and lesser-known altcoins with lower market caps stand a better chance of deliver quick 2x or more gains.Let’s have a look at some candidates for best crypto to buy now.Best Crypto to Buy NowFantom (FTM)Layer-1 blockchain competitor to Ethereum and Solana Fantom (FTM) is pumping hard on Monday, up 13.5% in 24 hours.That’s according to CoinMarketCap, which puts its market cap at $2.68 billion.Since breaking resistance around $0.80, FTM looks set up for a quick retest of its 2024 highs around $1.23.If this is the start of a new push higher, FTM could quickly 3.5x to return to its 2021 record highs above $3.50. That’s why it might be the best crypto to buy now.Injective (INJ)Another flashy layer-1 blockchain altcoins Injective (INJ) is also pumping hard, up 11% in 24 hours as per CoinMarketCap.If Injective can break to the north of its 50DMA, a quick retest of resistance at $30 becomes likely.A break above here would open the door to a quick return to March highs above $52.Injective could quickly 2x if it can break above short-term resistance levels, making it potentially the best crypto to buy now. Source: TradingViewGiven it could quickly enjoy 2x gains, INJ could be the best crypto to buy today.Sui (SUI)On a day when layer-1 altcoins are leading the market higher, Sui (SUI) is another token performing well.As per CoinMarketCap, it was last up 10% in 24 hours at $1.13, its market cap around $2.6 billion.Like Injective, SUI might be able to quickly 2x to return to yearly highs.But that depends on its breaking above key resistance, such as around $1.40.Crypto Alternatives to Consider
Altcoins are a great way to make quick gains in crypto. But most of the above-mentioned coins are already too well-established to provide traders with gains of upwards of 10x.For those bigger gains, traders will need to get in super early on newer coins.For risk-tolerant investors looking to add upside exposure to their portfolios, presale investing is potentially a good strategy.Web3 startups often sell their token at an early discount in presales to fund development and build hype.With so many presales on the market, it can be tough to know where to start. Here are some of Cryptonews’ top picks.21 Best Crypto Presales to Invest In Now

LayerZero Labs Identifies 800,000 Potential Sybil Addresses in Public List - The Defiant

The list is preliminary and not definitive until the final report is published.LayerZero Labs, a cross-chain interoperability protocol, on Sunday said that it has made public a list of 800,000 addresses flagged as created solely for the purpose of farming the project’s airdrop.On May 18, LayerZero concluded its Sybil self-reporting phase. During this period, users had the opportunity to report their wallet addresses as Sybils and receive 15% of their planned token allocation if they did so within a 14-day window.The 800,000 addresses account for 13% of the total six million addresses eligible for the airdrop.In an X post, LayerZero explained that the “remaining 85%” would be returned to “qualified users."LayerZero’s anti-Sybil campaign is one of the most aggressive efforts to identify and remove airdrop farmers at a time when the practice of using protocols to get token rewards in return has become a common practice in DeFi. The move has sparked some controversy, with some users arguing the line between legitimate trading and airdrop farming isn’t so clear-cut.In the context of blockchain networks, Sybil attacks involve creating multiple fake accounts to fraudulently accumulate tokens or rewards intended for legitimate users. This tactic manipulates token distributions by appearing as several unique participants. The goal is to exploit decentralized systems that reward user activity, often through mechanisms like airdrops.Initial analysisInitially, the team at LayerZero had identified over 2 million addresses as potential Sybils. They then refined their criteria to minimize false positives, ensuring that legitimate users were not wrongly labeled.The primary goal of this analysis was to identify and exclude "industrial Sybil clusters" from bounty hunting eligibility. These clusters are large groups of fake accounts created to manipulate token distributions.According to LayerZero, "This list is preliminary. It aims to remove large clusters of addresses from bounty hunting eligibility, but should not be seen as definitive until the final report is published. For example, an address could be removed from the sybil list as we update methodology."Bounty Hunting and RewardsParticipants interested in bounty hunting must report at least 20 addresses, outlining a clear methodology to prove they are sybils. Those who successfully report will receive 10% of the Sybil’s intended token allocation.An important note from LayerZero’s X post clarified that: "All bounties go to the first eligible reporter of a given address."The bounty hunting process started on May 18 and will continue until May 31. The final sybil list will be published afterward.Meanwhile, LayerZero Labs announced on May 2 that it completed the first snapshot for an upcoming airdrop. Eligibility criteria and details remain undisclosed.LayerZero adoptionData from Messari shows that in the first quarter of 2024, LayerZero protocol hosted over $6.7 billion worth of cross-chain asset transfers, marking a 91% increase from the previous quarter.Message traffic surged, with 29.6 million messages sent via LayerZero, reflecting a 60% quarterly increase. This period also saw a 93% rise in smart contract deployments on LayerZero, indicating growing developer adoption of the protocol.In April 2023, LayerZero raised $120 million in a Series B funding round, valuing the company at $3 billion.

May 23rd, the Big Day, is Near: Analysts Share Their Expectations on the Crypto Market and Prices - Bitcoin Sistemi


Analysts are predicting an increase in Ethereum price volatility ahead of this week's spot ETF application deadlines.
Cobo COO Lily King warned of increased volatility and cautious market behavior as traders navigate uncertainties. “We can expect volatility to increase and the market to remain cautious ahead of the decision on spot ETH ETF applications this week,” King said.


Presto research analyst Peter Chung echoed King's views in a report Monday. “Whether approval or rejection, we expect ETH volatility to increase as the May 23 deadline approaches,” Chung said.
The first round of spot ETH ETF deadlines is approaching, with VanEck's May 23 and Ark Invest/21Shares' May 24 deadlines.





However, the majority of analysts predict that the SEC will reject spot Ethereum ETF applications. Polymarket priced the chances of approval at just 14%. Market indicators show traders are largely expecting “rejection and non-event,” according to a report from QCP Capital released today.

However, the QCP Capital report added that a surprise approval of spot ETH ETFs this week could catch the market off guard. “This will trigger a short squeeze that easily takes us back to recent highs for ETH,” QCP Capital analysts said.


Analysts also argued that given ETH's dual role as both a store of value and a Layer 1 blockchain network, its approval would likely cause Ethereum to outperform Bitcoin in terms of price movement.

New York AG has reached a settlement with crypto lender Genesis for $2 billion to repay investors

A $2 billion settlement has been reached between New York Attorney General Letitia James and failed crypto lender Genesis to repay their investors. The settlement is said to be the largest against a cryptocurrency company in New York’s history. It mandates restitution for affected investors and bans Genesis trading from operating in the state.Nvidia stock has all-time closing high in its crosshairs“This historic settlement is a major step toward ensuring the victims who invested in Genesis have a semblance of justice,” said Attorney General James.“Once again, we see the real-world consequences and detrimental losses that can happen because of a lack of oversight and regulation within the cryptocurrency industry,” she added.“New York investors deserve the peace of mind that comes from a properly regulated marketplace, and that is something my office will always act to achieve.”As per the latest settlement, a “Victims’ Fund” for Genesis’ creditors will be created, and the victims will receive distributions from the assets remaining in Genesis’ estate. In the event that Genesis’ remaining assets are not sufficient to repay those creditors, the Victims’ Fund will receive up to $2 billion.This case relates to Sam Bankman-Fried’s FTX fraud in November 2022 and its consequences. Genesis, owned by Barry Silbert’s Digital Currency Group, was a lending partner of the crypto exchange Gemini’s Earn product. It had its derivatives unit lock up around $175 million in funds with FTX. After hearing the news of FTX’s collapse, Genesis paused withdrawals from the Earn program, which had approximately $900 million in assets from 340,000 users.Crypto exchange and Genesis creditor Gemini didn’t like the way Genesis dealt with the financial troubles. Cameron Winklevoss wrote an open letter in January 2023 addressed to the CEO of Digital Currency Group, the parent organization of Genesis. In the letter, he accused the parent firm of acting in “bad faith” by delaying the process of returning the $900 million owed to clients of Gemini’s Earn program.New York Attorney General Letitia James charged Gemini Trust, Genesis Capital, and Digital Currency Group with $1 billion in fraud in 2023. Genesis, which is undergoing bankruptcy proceedings,  agreed to give $1.1 billion back to crypto customers. Meanwhile, Genesis Global Capital, which is also bankrupt, agreed to pay $21 million to settle charges with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) for violating securities laws that are related to its involvement with the now-defunct Gemini Earn program.Recently, the failed crypto exchange FTX said in a statement that it expects almost 100% of its former customers to get back the money they lost when the cryptocurrency exchange collapsed. Earlier this year, FTX co-founder Sam-Bankman Fried was sentenced to jail for 25 years.

Solana On Fire, Analyst Expects SOL To Gain Another 90% Versus ETH


								Solana is tracking higher at spot rates as bulls appear keen to reclaim the 2024 highs printed in March. Amid this, one analyst is confident that SOL will extend gains versus Ethereum, looking at the candlestick arrangement in the daily chart.
Solana To Outperform Ethereum? 
Sharing a SOLETH chart on X, the analyst notes that though prices have been consolidating, SOL bulls have the upper hand. So far, a clear “Cup and Handle” pattern is forming. 

While it does not guarantee higher prices, the pattern historically prints out, preceding a bull run and breakout above the local resistance. 
SOLETH prices trending upward | Source: @Negentropic_ on X
 
If the SOL bulls take over, the analyst predicts the SOLETH ratio will extend by at least 90%. After checking the events on the daily chart, it is clear that buyers have the upper hand. Despite the recent drawdown across the crypto scene, SOL has outperformed ETH in the last few months. 
The local resistance and all-time high in the SOLETH chart is at 0.05806 ETH. A breakout above this line will propel SOL to new territory, extending gains as Solana comes on top of Ethereum. 
Looking at the SOLUSDT chart, the coin is changing hands at around $177. After the recent breakout above $160, bulls appear to be in control, targeting. The $200 line remains a key target for upbeat bulls aiming for prices to clear all-time highs of $260 registered in 2021.
Solana trending upward on the daily chart | Source: SOLUSDT on Binance, TradingView
Multiple fundamental factors could ignite SOL demand. However, what’s been clear in the past few months is that Solana is increasingly a preferred choice for meme coins. Some of the most successful ones, including DogWifHat (WIF), BOME, and BONK, are all on Solana.
From Firedancer Hopes To Rising Adoption, SOL Trends Higher
Features such as high scalability, low transaction fees, and a developing ecosystem could explain the uptick. At the same time, the community is looking forward to the activation of the Firedancer validator client. 

The client, built from scratch by Jump Crypto, will make the network more reliable, reducing instances of network halts. In the past, Solana has been widely criticized for stopping on multiple occasions, inconveniencing network users.
Top utility apps | Source: Apple Store
The rapid expansion of the Solana-centric non-custodial Phantom wallet reflects surging interest in Solana. The wallet has climbed to the fourth position in the utility category on the Apple App Store. By the end of April, the Phantom Wallet had over seven million monthly active users.

Bitcoin "Profit-Taking Has Completed," Top Analyst Reveals


																An analyst has explained how profit-taking looks to have finished for Bitcoin in what has been a “very healthy reset” for the market.
Bitcoin SOPR Suggests Profit-Taking From Investors Has Cooled Off
In a new post on X, analyst Willy Woo has discussed about the latest trend occurring in the Bitcoin Spent Output Profit Ratio (SOPR). The SOPR is an on-chain indicator that basically tells us about whether the Bitcoin investors as a whole are selling their coins at a profit or loss right now.
When the value of this metric is greater than 1, it means that the average holder in the sector could be assumed to be moving coins at some net profit currently. On the other hand, the indicator being negative implies loss realization is the dominant mode of selling in the market.

	Related Reading



Naturally, the SOPR being exactly equal to 1 suggests the total profits being realized are exactly equal to the losses at the moment and thus, the investors are just breaking-even on their selling.
Now, here is a chart that shows the trend in the Bitcoin SOPR over the last few years:

The value of the metric seems to have been neutral in recent days | Source: @woonomic on X
As is visible in the above graph, the Bitcoin SOPR had spiked to highly positive levels earlier when the cryptocurrency’s price had observed its rally towards a new all-time high (ATH).
This would suggest that the investors had been participating in some aggressive profit-taking during this run. From the chart, it’s visible that such a trend was also observed around the start of the 2021 bull run.
With the consolidation, the asset has gone through since the ATH, the indicator’s value has also seen a cooldown. As Woo has highlighted in the chart, the metric has now approached the neutral mark.
It would appear that two months after the profit-taking peaked, the appetite for harvesting gains has potentially finally disappeared among the investors. The analyst says this is a very healthy reset for the cryptocurrency, especially as the capital inflows have once again been picking up for the coin.

Looks like the indicator has gone through a turnaround recently | Source: @woonomic
From the chart, it’s apparent that the Bitcoin network flows had been following an overall downward trajectory earlier when the consolidation was taking place, but recently, capital injections into the coin have once again been on the rise.

	Related Reading



This is a similar trend to what was observed earlier in the year during the crash following the approval of the spot exchange-traded funds (ETFs). The turnabout in capital inflows back then was what led into the rally that took the cryptocurrency to the current ATH.
BTC Price
Bitcoin had seen a pullback under $66,000 yesterday, raising worries that the recovery surge had already fizzled out. This drop only lasted briefly, though, as the coin has returned above $67,000 today.

Analyst Declares This Week Is The Most Important Week In Cryptocurrency History In The US - And Explains Why - Bitcoin Sistemi

Blockchain Association official Ron Hammond declared this week as the most important week for cryptocurrencies in the US capital, in a statement today.
Crypto Bill Awaits Presidential Decision
SAB 121 CRA, a crypto bill that garnered a staggering 60 votes in the Senate, is currently on President Biden's desk, awaiting his decision by May 28. The bill received support from both the House Speaker and the Senate Majority Leader. Despite Biden's first sign that he would veto the bill before it votes in the House of Representatives, strong support from top Democrats in the Senate has put the White House in a difficult position.


Another bill that Biden initially signaled he would veto, the DC Crime CRA, became law after a significant defection from most members of his own party. This precedent suggests the possibility of Biden reversing his stance on SAB 121 CRA. Increasing understanding of the importance of cryptocurrencies for many voters, especially young voters, may also affect this decision.
FIT21: A New Regulatory Framework
This week will also mark a major milestone with the House of Representatives scheduled to vote on FIT21, a comprehensive crypto regulatory framework. Talks will begin Wednesday, with a vote expected late Wednesday afternoon or early Thursday. Given the SEC's unsuccessful arguments against a crypto framework, the bill is expected to receive significant bipartisan support.





A year ago, the SEC argued that the rules were clear, the laws did not need to be updated, and that they had not been defeated in court in all crypto cases. However, their recent defeats in the courts, lack of action against bad examples like FTX, and involvement in high-profile crypto cases have shown that the current status quo is not working.
The FIT21 vote could see a rare strong bipartisan vote in a fractured Congress. The level of support will determine whether the bill has any traction in the Senate, which is less concerned with the crypto market structure.



ETH ETF Decision Approaching
On the same day as the FIT21 vote, the SEC will make a decision on the Ethereum ETF for Ark Invest and VanEck. Many political signals and public comments from issuers lead many to believe it will be rejected.
This week offers three opportunities for the Biden Administration to clarify its stance on crypto. This week could be a defining moment for crypto policy in the US as crypto becomes an increasingly important topic for many young Americans. As Hammond noted, “This bull run is not about memecoins, it is about policy gains.”

In a 231-page ruling, Judge James Mellor unequivocally stated that Wright “lied to the court repeatedly” and that his claim to be Nakamoto is “his biggest lie.”The judgment stems from a lawsuit filed by the Crypto Open Patent Alliance (COPA), representing major cryptocurrency and blockchain firms.COPA sought declaratory relief to prevent Wright from pursuing copyright claims over the Bitcoin codebase and white paper based on his alleged status as Satoshi Nakamoto.Judge Mellor methodically dismantled Wright’s case, describing it as “riddled with inconsistencies and absurd explanations.”Mellor accused Wright of forging documents and submitting fake evidence “on a grand scale” in his failed effort to prove he authored the Satoshi white paper and mined the first Bitcoins in 2009.“Dr. Wright has not proved that he is Satoshi Nakamoto,” Mellor bluntly concluded. “He has deliberately attempted to deceive the court on this specific issue.”The judge’s assessment represents a major credibility blow to Wright, who has brought numerous copyright infringement lawsuits premised on being Bitcoin’s creator.Questions Over Craig Wright’s Litigation Funding And Hodlonaut’s Reaction to the Verdict
Following the judge’s ruling, the question about who Wright’s financier was in his years of legal tussle still lingers. There is an unconfirmed rumor that online gambling tycoon Calvin Ayre is his major financier, even though the billionaire voiced skepticism about the authenticity of Wright’s claim.Meanwhile, Hodlonaut, a well-known Bitcoin maximalist previously sued by Wright for libel over calling him a “fraud,” took to social media to reiterate his stance.Resurrecting a hashtag he hadn’t used since 2019, Hodlonaut took to X to share excerpts from the court’s written judgment, highlighting how the judge deemed Wright’s claims to be an “intricate web of lies.”The judge’s scathing remarks included assertions that Wright is “not nearly as clever as he thinks he is” and that he “lied to the court repeatedly,” with most of his lies and forged documents supporting “his biggest lie” of being Satoshi Nakamoto.Hodlonaut also quoted the judge’s observation that Wright engaged in “the deliberate production of false documents to support false claims and use the Courts as a vehicle for fraud” across multiple jurisdictions.The conclusive rejection of Wright’s claims comes after a legal battle that lasted almost five years.During this time, Wright sued Hodlonaut for libel over social media posts that called him a “scammer” and a “fraud” for falsely claiming to be Bitcoin’s inventor.Recall that Wright dropped his defamation appeal against Hodlonaut in April 2024 after initially losing the defamation lawsuit in October 2023.

Launch a Memecoin on Base with Basecamp | Bankless


It’s memecoin season, and with the growing interest here we’ve seen a rise in “memecoin launcher” projects. The idea? These do-it-yourself platforms make it easy to create and deploy your own memecoins in a streamlined and secure fashion. I’ve covered a couple of these projects so far, like Pump.fun and Party, and more are launching every week. A new one that caught my eye this month is Basecamp. Pump.fun Hit for $2M in Flash Loan Exploit on BanklessSolana’s buzzy memecoin launcher hit with attack.Created by the builders at Sudoswap (one of my favorite protocol teams), Basecamp is a 1-click memecoin deployer with no launch costs except the ETH you need for gas. Specifically, Basecamp is tailored for releasing memecoins on Uniswap’s Base deployment. Typically, you would need upfront capital to create a liquidity pool (LP) for a new token, but Basecamp lets you set up a pool without any initial liquidity provided. It also locks the liquidity to prevent rugging, and it lets creators keep 5% of a token’s supply and earn 66% of all accrued LP fees. Pretty cool, right? Well, if you’re interested in exploring, it’s straightforward to dive in. First, head to basecamp.wtf and connect a wallet. Note, you might notice wallets like MetaMask, Rainbow, Rabby, etc. throw a “warning” message when you go to connect. This is a common precaution with new sites and is meant to be a first line of defense against nefarious platforms. Sudoswap is legit so you can ignore here, but feel free to sign in with a burner wallet if you’d like to go the extra mile!Once you’re logged in, you can start reviewing new and trending tokens on Basecamp or press the “Launch Token” button to start setting up your own. Clicking into an already existing token will bring you to an interface where you can review that coin’s main liquidity and activity stats or link out to trade on the associated Uniswap pool, like so:As for creating your own memecoin, the “Launch Token” button on the homepage will take you to a modal where you can input your token’s desired name, ticker, supply, and starting market cap. Remember, you don’t have to supply ETH for this market cap; instead Basecamp adjusts your LP size to target your choice. I was able to create a coin in less than one minute with less than $1 of gas.When you’re ready to proceed, press “Launch Token,” complete the deploy transaction with your wallet, and voila: your memecoin will now be live on Uniswap and Base.At this point, you’ll be taken to the token profile of your coin. This interface offers an admin panel where you’ll be able to claim LP fees going forward if your token gains any traction. Of course, keep in mind that Basecamp is brand new, and there is no guarantee that any tokens you create here will have any lasting success. What the platform has going for it, though, is that it’s arguably the easiest, fastest, and cheapest place to deploy memecoins today, and that’s nothing to sneeze at. It took me longer to write the first few sentences of this post than it took me to launch the example MMT token above!Accordingly, Basecamp democratizes access to token creation and can potentially fuel a new wave of creative and community-driven projects on Base. In the meantime, it’s a great resource to bookmark for your onchain toolbox—don’t sleep on it!

Is the SEC’s expected spot ether ETF denial priced in? - Blockworks


Industry watchers seem to agree that if US regulators approve spot ether ETFs, it would be a bullish development for the asset. What’s more, they believe that even if these ETFs are not approved, the impact on the market will not be significantly negative.
That is in part due to market participants’ low expectations that the Securities and Exchange Commission will approve such funds this time around. 
The SEC has until May 23 to rule on a proposed ETH fund by VanEck. Its deadline for a similar planned offering from Ark Invest and 21Shares is the next day.
Segment observers expect, like with bitcoin ETFs, that the securities regulator will rule on all the ETH fund applications at once.   
Ether’s price was about $3,140 at 2:30 pm ET Monday — up about 7% from a week ago but a far cry from its year-to-date high above $4,000 in mid-March.
A spot ether ETF approval decision would spur immediate price appreciation and a medium-term new all-time high above $4,800, according to Jeff Embry, managing partner of crypto hedge fund Globe 3 Capital.
“The difference between the bitcoin [ETF] approval and ETH’s possible approval, is that the market had fully expected the bitcoin approval and had pre-priced it, thus causing an initial sell off on the news,” Embry told Blockworks.
Contrarily, various industry watchers have said they expect the SEC to deny ether ETFs this month. 
Reasons include the SEC’s hesitation to clearly label ether as a security or a commodity, the regulator’s lack of engagement with prospective issuers in recent weeks and the slightly weaker correlation between the ether spot and futures markets compared to bitcoin.
It also took Grayscale Investments’ legal victory against the SEC to help get US spot bitcoin ETFs approved — something some lawyers said might be needed before ether funds get the green light. 
Read more: Why the SEC could choose to deny ether ETFs, and what could happen next
The expected SEC rejection of spot ether ETFs is reflected in ETH’s roughly 20% price dip since mid-March, Embry noted.
“If the SEC denies the ETH ETF, we would expect to see an initial sell off of 5% to 12%, but short lived, as the bull market is a much more powerful driver of pricing and will ultimately move pricing up,” the executive added.
Indeed, the approval of an Ethereum ETF next week is viewed as a low probability event, and ether is priced as such, said LMAX Group market strategist Joel Kruger.
There might be room for ETH to drop lower in the case of a denial — though such a downtrend should not exceed 10%, he added.  
“If on the other hand the market is surprised with an approval, we could see the price of ETH surge by some 30% in the immediate aftermath,” Kruger said, “with such a move setting the stage for a run to retest the 2021 record high in the weeks that follow.”

Institutions Pour $932,000,000 Into Crypto Products Amid Prospect of Interest Rate Cuts: CoinShares - The Daily Hodl


								Digital assets manager CoinShares says institutions poured nearly a billion dollars into crypto products last week in response to Consumer Price Index (CPI) data.
In its latest Digital Asset Fund Flows report, CoinShares says digital asset investment products raked in $932 million in net inflows last week despite trading volumes being down approximately 75% from March.










“Interestingly, the inflows were an immediate response to the lower-than-expected CPI report on Wednesday, with the latter three trading days of the week making up 89% of the total flows, highlighting our view that Bitcoin prices have recoupled to interest rate expectations.”
Source: CoinShares
In terms of regional inflows, the US provided the lion’s share at $1 billion.
“Switzerland and Germany also saw minor inflows of $27 million and $4.2 million respectively, while Hong Kong and Canada saw outflows totaling $83 million and $17 million respectively.”
While short Bitcoin (BTC) investment products saw little engagement, BTC enjoyed $942 million in inflows, suggesting bullish sentiment amongst investors, according to CoinShares
In terms of altcoins, Solana (SOL), Chainlink (LINK) and Cardano (ADA) brought in $4.9 million, $3.7 million and $1.9 million in inflows, respectively, while Ethereum (ETH) suffered $23.3 million in outflows, bringing ETH’s total year-to-date outflows to $57 million.
“Ethereum continues to suffer from bearishness over the prospects for an SEC approval of a spot-based ETF this week…”

Change at the Top of Grayscale: Michael Sonnenshein Resigns

Michael Sonnenshein, CEO of Grayscale, has decided to resign from his role, raising several questions about the reasons behind this decision. According to the company, Sonnenshein is leaving his position to “pursue other interests”. This move has sparked a series of speculations and discussions within the investment and cryptocurrency industry.
Sonnenshein has been a key figure in the growth and development of Grayscale, one of the largest digital asset managers in the world. During his tenure, the company has seen significant expansion, especially with the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC), one of Grayscale’s most popular products. However, despite the success of GBTC, the fund has recently faced some challenges.
One of the main issues concerns the spot bitcoin ETF GBTC, which has seen the exit of numerous investors despite an increase in overall inflows. This phenomenon could be attributed to several factors, including the volatility of the cryptocurrency market and concerns regarding regulation. Although Grayscale has sought approval from the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) of the United States to convert the GBTC into an ETF, this goal has not yet been achieved, adding further uncertainty for investors.
The departure of Sonnenshein comes at a crucial time for Grayscale, which is trying to navigate through these challenges and consolidate its position in the digital asset market. His exit could be seen as a signal of strategic change within the company. However, the exact reasons behind Sonnenshein’s decision remain unclear. Some analysts suggest that increasing pressure and high expectations may have played a role in his decision to resign.

The new CEO of Grayscale
To take on the role of CEO will be Peter Mintzberg, a former executive of Goldman Sachs. Mintzberg will join the team of Grayscale on August 15, 2024. His appointment has been met with interest and curiosity, given his extensive experience in the traditional financial sector. During his time at Goldman Sachs, Mintzberg held various leadership roles, accumulating a deep knowledge of financial markets and investment dynamics.
The arrival of Mintzberg could represent a new era for Grayscale, bringing with him a fresh perspective and innovative strategies. His experience could prove valuable in addressing current and future challenges, especially in a market environment that is constantly evolving like that of cryptocurrencies. Furthermore, his appointment could strengthen investor confidence, reassuring them about Grayscale’s ability to navigate through market turbulence.
Mintzberg will have the task of leading Grayscale through a period of transition, trying to balance the needs of investors with market dynamics. His leadership will be crucial for the company, which will have to face significant regulatory and competitive challenges. In addition, he will have to work to obtain SEC approval for the long-awaited ETF on bitcoin, a step that could radically transform Grayscale’s position in the cryptocurrency investment sector.
Conclusions
In conclusion, Michael Sonnenshein’s resignation as CEO of Grayscale marks the end of an era and the beginning of a new chapter for the company. Peter Mintzberg’s entry brings new opportunities and challenges. Mintzberg’s ability to quickly adapt and implement effective strategies will be crucial for the future of Grayscale. Investors and the cryptocurrency market will closely watch the upcoming developments, trying to understand how the company will face the challenges and capitalize on the opportunities under the new leadership.

Bitcoin ETFs Are Back With Nearly $1 Billion In Fresh Cash - Decrypt

We do the research, you get the alpha!Get exclusive reports and access to key insights on airdrops, NFTs, and more! Subscribe now to Alpha Reports and up your game!Go to Alpha ReportsBitcoin bounced back strongly from its April slump last week, boosting the performance of newly launched Bitcoin spot ETFs.On May 15, the price of BTC surged from $61,800 to $66,000, and is now trading for over $68,500 for the first time in over a month, per CoinGecko data. Meanwhile, net inflows to Bitcoin investment products globally exceeded $942 million, dwarfing $144 million from the previous week—and reversing four straight weeks of net outflows before that. According to CoinShares, the sudden resurgence in Bitcoin demand is directly related to evolving macroeconomic conditions. “The inflows were an immediate response to the lower-than-expected CPI report on Wednesday, with the latter three trading days of the week making up 89% of the total flows,” the firm’s Head of Research, James Butterfill, wrote in a Monday blog post.Bitcoin price movements have historically correlated with central bank policy expectations, with prices rising as interest rates fall, and vice versa. With April CPI inflation rising just 0.3 percent month over month, markets have renewed confidence that the Fed may soon conclude its battle to slow rising prices across the country. That should bring lower interest rates, cheaper debt, and higher valuations for both stocks and crypto. According to CME FedWatch, markets are 50% confident that the Fed will first lower interest rates by 25 basis points in September. Aside from the changing macro outlook, numerous major U.S. investors disclosed allocations to Bitcoin spot ETFs as part of mandatory 13F filings this month. By the end of Q1, exactly 944 unique filers—each of which controls over $100 million in assets—reported owning $10.7 billion worth of Bitcoin ETF shares. Those holdings make up over 20% of total assets in those ETFs. One such investor included the State of Wisconsin Investment Board, which held $163 million in BTC across BlackRock and Grayscale’s Bitcoin ETFs as of March 31. As a whole, the pension fund held $155 billion in assets as of Q4 2023.In a memo last week, Bitwise CIO Matt Hougan said the filings had him “incredibly bullish” on the ETFs, since those massive asset managers who had already invested would likely allocate more over time. “Hightower Advisors may have $68 million allocated to Bitcoin ETFs today, for instance, which is great, but it’s just 0.05% of their assets,” he noted. If that were to eventually grow to 1%—as is typical of most investors, in Hougan’s view—that would mean a $1.2 billion allocation from Hightower alone. In other Bitcoin ETF news, Michael Sonnhenshein, CEO of the world’s largest such fund, Grayscale, stepped down from his position on Monday, saying “the crypto asset class is at an important inflection point and this is the right moment for a smooth transition.”Edited by Ryan Ozawa.Daily Debrief NewsletterStart every day with the top news stories right now, plus original features, a podcast, videos and more.

Institutions Ramp Up Crypto Exposure As Weekly Volume Plummets: CoinShares - The Defiant

Large entities recorded inflows of $932 million, mostly in response to U.S. CPI data.
Weekly inflows into digital asset funds climbed by the most since late March even as volumes dropped, according to CoinShares’ latest Digital Asset Fund Flows Weekly Report.Major institutions added $932 million in cryptocurrency to their portfolios last week, the report said, while volume dropped by 75% from March to $10.5 billion. The seven days ended on May 19 mark the second weekly inflow in a row after four weeks of outflows.The additional $932 million brings the yearly total for institutions to a whopping $13.8 billion.An age-old adage dubbed “sell in May and go away” appears to be in full force. Seasonal behavior among traders, with activity dropping as summer approaches, explains lower volumes. Meanwhile, inflows remain strong as institutions continue to load up on digital assets thanks to spot ETFs.The disparity, according to James Butterfill, head of Research at CoinShares, “signifies that the hype around the launch is over and now it's trading more on fundamentals.” He told The Defiant, however, that volume continues to be higher than the $2 billion weekly average from 2023.Last week, major firms responded swiftly to the U.S. CPI report that showed signs of inflation beginning to slow down, leading to a significant bounce in prices across the crypto market. On May 15, the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics reported that consumer prices had dropped for the first time in six months.Butterfill added that the latter three days of trading–once the report had been published–represented 89% of all institutional trading, “highlighting our view that Bitcoin prices have recoupled to interest rate expectations.”Grayscale Stumps AnalystAfter suffering $16.6 billion in outflows since the launch of the Bitcoin ETF on Jan. 11, Grayscale saw minor inflows the past week for the first time, increasing its crypto holdings by $18 million.“I’m stumped regarding Grayscale,” said Butterfill. “It's a much higher cost product, my only idea is that every ETF needs due diligence, and if you already have an issuer onboarded it saves a whole load of due diligence for a fund manager.”So why are investors using it? “Simply ease of access,” he said.It'a All About BitcoinBitcoin was most favored by large firms with $942 million in inflows on the week, hinting at an overall positive sentiment. Over the course of the month, institutions have accumulated $790 million in BTC, which brings the yearly total to $13.5 billion.On the other hand, the least favored asset by big funds continues to be Ethereum. The asset registered outflows worth $23 million, notching the monthly total to $46 million offloaded. Year to date, $57 million has left institutional coffers.Most other cryptocurrencies registered minor accumulation from institutions. Large players added $4.9 million in SOL over the past week, along with $3.7 million in Chainlink, and $1.9 million in XRP.Entities from the United States continue to dominate over their European, Asian, and Latin American counterparts. More than $1 billion in inflows went to U.S.-based funds, while Hong Kong turned bearish with $82 million exiting companies.

                        Major blockchain company Ripple has faced multiple criticisms over its increasing sales of the XRP token. On May 19, Ripple’s Chief Technology Officer (CTO), David Schwartz, explained why the company was selling its XRP holdings.Ripple’s XRP Holdings and Escrow Release Strategy
Schwartz’s comments were in response to a thread that criticized Ripple’s large XRP holdings and sales strategy.As detailed in its Q1 2024 report, Ripple’s XRP holdings are divided into two main categories: liquid and available XRP in Ripple’s wallets and XRP locked in escrow accounts set for controlled release over 42 months.As of March 31, 2024, Ripple held 4.8 billion XRP tokens directly, while another 40.1 billion XRP were locked in escrow.A portion of escrowed XRP is released each month, though most are subsequently returned to reset the escrow clock.Schwartz portrayed the sales as Ripple’s only viable option for accessing liquidity from its XRP holdings besides letting the tokens sit indefinitely. The company has not indicated plans to halt or dramatically ramp up the sales.In response to Schwartz’s revelations about Ripple’s XRP sales, an anonymous crypto researcher known as Darkhorse urged the company to reconsider its strategies. One suggestion was temporarily halting sales to gauge the price impact.Schwartz stressed the importance of transparency in Ripple’s actions, asserting that deliberate price manipulation would be unethical.Some users asked Schwartz if Ripple might change its approach in the future. They also suggested that Ripple’s large XRP holdings might discourage developers from building network projects. This doesn’t seem to be the case. As CryptoNews reported, XRP Ledger transactions jumped 100% in the first quarter of 2024.As the third-largest crypto by market cap, XRP is trading around $0.50 per token, down from recent highs around $0.80. After an upward price trend from May 2023 to April 2024, XRP has pulled back around 22% and is currently testing support levels. At press time, XRP trades at $0.517.SEC Criticized for Aggressive Stance on Crypto Firms
Ripple’s legal tussle with the SEC continues, and there is no end in sight. In a recent filing, the blockchain company pushed back against the regulator’s demand for a $2 billion penalty fee, which it deems excessive and overly punitive.Ripple’s argument is simple – the penalty demanded by the SEC is not justifiable since there were no accusations of reckless or fraudulent behavior.“In a case that had no allegations (or findings) of recklessness or fraud, and in which Ripple won on significant issues, the SEC’s task is just more evidence of its ongoing intimidation against all of crypto in the U.S,” Ripple Chief Legal Officer Stuart Alderoty explained.The SEC has been getting a lot of flak lately for its crackdown on crypto firms. Recall that Coinbase’s chief legal officer Paul Grewal had called on other crypto companies to query the regulator’s previous actions, citing the SEC’s case against Debt Box. Grewal believes the SEC’s departure from its usual processes raises questions about the validity of its claims and possible abuse of power.

A Milestone in the Cryptocurrency Market - 2 Billion Dollar Deal Approved by Judge - Bitcoin Sistemi


In a critical decision, a New York bankruptcy judge gave the green light to a $2 billion settlement between the New York State Attorney General's Office and crypto lender Genesis.
The approval comes several months after Genesis filed a petition in the U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of New York seeking Judge Sean Lane's approval of the settlement.


New York Attorney General Letitia James expressed her satisfaction with the result in her statement today. “When investors suffer losses due to fraud and manipulation, they deserve to be compensated,” James said.

“This historic settlement is an important step towards ensuring that victims who invested in Genesis have a piece of justice.”


The settlement, the largest settlement against a crypto firm in state history, includes a victim fund designed to assist New York investors who contributed more than $1.1 billion to Genesis through its Gemini Earn program.





The lawsuit was first filed by Attorney General James against Bitcoin exchange Gemini, Genesis, and later its parent company, Digital Currency Group, over Gemini's cryptocurrency lending program. Genesis and Gemini offered the program to individual investors in 2021 and promised the opportunity to earn returns of up to 7.4 percent.

Here’s Why ETH Just Exploded 10% Back To $3400


																Ether (ETH) surged 10% on Monday in the span of a few minutes following credible rumors that the asset could receive its own spot ETF in the United States within days.

ETH traded for $3150 on Monday at 17:44 UTC, before surging to $3450 within 25 minutes.
This followed a tweet from Bloomberg ETF analyst Eric Balchunas at 17:20 UTC that he and his partner, James Seyffart, were upping their odds of ETH ETH approval this month from 25% to 75%.
“Hearing chatter this afternoon that SEC could be doing a 180 on this (increasingly political issue), so now everyone scrambling (like us everyone else assumed they’d be denied),” he explained.
Earlier this month, the US House and Senate passed H.J.Res.109 – a resolution to scrap an anti-crypto banking rule previously established by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).
The resolution passed both chambers with bipartisan support despite a promise from President Joe Biden to veto the act if it reached his desk, showing that many Democrats don’t respect the anti-crypto position adopted by their party’s leadership.
Seyffart confirmed that his and Balchunas’ accounts were not hacked and that their odds changes were based on input from multiple sources. “Should see a bunch of filings over coming days if we’re correct,” he added.
Fox Business reporter Eleanor Terret also said on Wednesday that she’d received input from a prospective ETF issuer that things are “evolving in real time” regarding the approval of their application.
Bitcoin also pumped on the news, rising 5% to $69,850 on Monday. According to Coinglass, the crypto market has experienced $226 million in liquidations within the past 24 hours.

After Epic Jump in Bitcoin and Ethereum, Big Bear il Capo Reveals What to Expect Next in Price - Bitcoin Sistemi


After the last big rise in the cryptocurrency market, il Capo of Crypto, one of the most well-known analysts, talked about what he expects.
Almost all analysts and the market were expecting a rejection decision for Ethereum Spot ETFs, which had a decision deadline of May 23. Prices were suppressed due to this effect.


In a seriously surprising development today, Bloomberg analysts Eric Balchunas and James Seyffart stated in their statement that they received some information and increased the probability of approval of Ethereum Spot ETFs from 25% to 75%. Bloomberg analysts saw confirmation as unlikely, although their previous official estimate was 25%.

Now, there is a great sense of hope in the market and the market is on the rise.





Cryptocurrency analyst il Capo stated in his message that Bitcoin reached its target of between $69,000 and $70,000. Evaluating Ethereum, the analyst said that the $ 3,300 resistance was broken, which he described as bull confirmation.
il Capo stated that the rise started under the leadership of Ethereum and Solana and shared that he thought most altcoins would follow them.

WIF Surges 10% Amid Whale Frenzy, New ATH Soon?


																The recent market pump saw the surge of many sectors in the crypto market. Fueled by Roaring Kitty’s return, part of the memecoin sector registered remarkable gains over the past week, with Tokens like Pepe (PEPE), Popcat (POPCAT), and Dogwifhat (WIF) leading the way.

	Related Reading



Due to its recent performance, some analysts forecast a new boost for WIF soon, while some whales load their bags with the dog-themed token.
Whales Put Their Hats On
Dogwifhat’s price soared after Roaring Kitty’s comeback, surging to $3.25 and prompting whales to fill their bags. However, the price fluctuations over the past week have made some large investors sell the dog-themed memecoin at a loss.
After WIF’s price dropped over the weekend, a whale sold 1.7 million tokens at a loss to buy BONK and the Donald Trump-inspired memecoin TREMP, the address initially bought WIF at $2.94 in March and sold it on Sunday at an average of $2.57.
Nonetheless, the price drop was seen as an opportunity for other large-scale investors. According to Lookonchain, a whale created a new wallet to buy Dogfight. On Monday, the wallet withdrew 1.83 million USDC from Coinbase to buy the dog-themed token.
At the time of the report, the investor had spent 606,000 USDC to buy 227,896 WIF at $2.66.  The wallet had 1.22 million USDC left to continue the buying spree. A few hours later, the whale had spent another 400,000 USDC to buy 145,000 more tokens. As of this writing, the address displays a total WIF balance of 472,614, worth around $1.28 million.
Similarly, another whale created a new wallet to buy dogwifhat. Per the reports, this whale used SOL to scoop 1 million WIF, worth around $2.53 million, on Sunday. Since then, the address has added more tokens to his bag, currently holding 1.39 million WIF, worth $3.8 million.
WIF Ready For A New ATH This Month?
The recent whale activity seemingly fueled the token’s price to soar above $2.7, hovering between $2.7 and $2.73 in the following hours. The surge represents a 10.4% increase in the past 24 hours.
Despite the recent performance, the token still registers red numbers in longer timeframes. WIF’s price has decreased by 8.3% and 14.8% in the weekly and bi-weekly timeframes. Moreover, its daily trading volume has seen a significant 21.6% decrease in the past 24 hours.
Nonetheless, market watchers consider that this cycle’s dog-themed sensation still has its hat on. Crypto trader Scient identified a bull pennant pattern on WIF’s chart.

Per the trader, the token is still consolidating inside the pattern. The token’s performance displayed “another bullish sign indicating that this consolidation is ending soon” after having a higher high followed by a lower high.
Similarly, Ansem, a popular trader and figure in the crypto world, suggested that WIF could be preparing for new highs.

To him, dogfight will reach a new all-time high (ATH) alongside Solana (SOL) by the end of the month? The breakout will end a “3-month period of bullish consolidation after the last leg up,” lining “with BTC’s bullishness.”

Canada’s ‘Crypto King’ Facing Multiple Years Behind Bars for Allegedly Running $30,475,000 Fraud: Report - The Daily Hodl


								Canadian authorities have arrested a 25-year-old man for allegedly masterminding a crypto Ponzi scheme that defrauded investors for over $30 million.
After an 18-month investigation, police in Ontario have announced that they arrested Aiden Pleterski for fraud and money laundering charges, Canadian government-funded media CBC reports.










Says Ontario Police Chief Peter Moreira,
“It’s alleged that Pleterski solicited funds from investors promising massive profits and also guaranteeing no loss for the original money put out by investors…
These investors became concerned when they were unable to access money held by Pleterski and came forward to police.”
Police in Durham, Ontario initially received complaints in July of 2022 from investors concerned that they couldn’t access their money, sparking a joint investigation between Durham Regional Police and the Ontario Securities Commission (OSC) dubbed Project Swan, according to Moreira.
27-year-old Colin Murphy, an alleged associate of Pieterski, was also arrested and charged with fraud.
According to CBC, a Toronto-based bankruptcy proceeding in Ontario’s Superior Court has recovered about $2.20 million for roughly 160 investors.
An investigation by a licensed insolvency trustee found Pleterski – self-proclaimed as the “Crypto King”– only invested about 2% of his investors’ funds. At the same time, he spent $11.75 million to fund a luxurious lifestyle including going on vacations, renting jets and mansions and buying high-end cars.
Stephen Henkel, a senior investigator for the Ontario Securities Commission (OSC), says the size of the alleged fraud was “massive” and required specialized investigators to fully cover the complex paper trails of the case.
“The investigative team included forensic accountants from the OSC…
This specialized skill set was vital in the investigation because it enabled us to analyze huge volumes of financial information, quantify the alleged fraud and follow the money…
It is critical that all those considering whether to purchase digital assets or any investment product first check whether the person or the business they deal with is registered with Canadian securities regulators.” 
BBC reports that Pleterski faces a maximum of 14 years behind bars if convicted.

Ether ($ETH) Enjoys Massive Surge in Purchase After Bloomberg Analysts Increase Odds of Spot ETH ETF Approval by U.S. SEC | Cryptoglobe


                                
Ether (ETH) experienced a significant price surge, climbing 11.4% during U.S. trading hours on Monday. The rally was sparked by a noteworthy update from two well-known Bloomberg ETF analysts, Eric Balchunas and James Seyffart, who substantially increased their estimated likelihood of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) approving spot ETH ETFs.







In a post on the social media platform X, Balchunas shared that he and Seyffart had revised their odds of spot Ether ETF approval from 25% to 75%. The decision to increase the odds was based on rumors circulating in the afternoon, suggesting that the SEC might be reconsidering its stance on this increasingly political issue. Consequently, market participants are now scrambling to adjust their positions, as many had previously assumed that the ETFs would be denied approval.







The SEC is currently facing several final deadlines this week regarding the approval or denial of spot ETFs, having postponed decisions on these funds on multiple occasions. The potential approval of spot ETH ETFs is expected to have a significant impact on the cryptocurrency market, as it would provide a new avenue for institutional investors to gain exposure to Ether.







            
            

            
            

            
            

        

In response to the news, Bitcoin (BTC) has also experienced gains, rising more than 5% and approaching the $70,000 level. 







The positive sentiment surrounding the potential approval of spot ETH ETFs appears to be spilling over into the broader cryptocurrency market as investors anticipate increased institutional adoption and liquidity.

Programmable Bitcoin Blockchain - The Key To Triggering The Next Explosive Price Surge? | Bitcoinist.com


								Following the launch of the first US spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) in January and last month’s Halving event, crypto investors have been waiting for the next major catalyst to propel Bitcoin to new heights beyond its current record of $73,700, set on March 14. 
According to a recent Bloomberg report, for a growing chorus of developers, the answer may lie in improving the cryptocurrency’s core blockchain with greater programmability.
The Next Chapter In Crypto? 
Bitcoin has long been viewed primarily as “digital gold,” doing little beyond basic transactions. In contrast, the Ethereum network has gained a reputation for its smart contract functionality, with applications ranging from lending and borrowing to yield farming.
A wave of upcoming new projects is working to bring this kind of programmatic flexibility to the Bitcoin blockchain. Using techniques like the “Ordinals” protocol for embedding data in BTC’s smallest unit (the satoshi), developers are reportedly opening up new possibilities for creating tokens, smart contracts, and even decentralized applications (dApps) directly on the Bitcoin network.

“It’s a huge unlock for Bitcoin,” said Kyle Samani, co-founder of crypto investment firm Multicoin Capital, which recently led a $7 million funding round for Arch, a startup building a programmable platform on top of Bitcoin. 
According to the report, Arch, which is expected to open to all developers as early as this month, will allow apps built on the Solana blockchain to be ported to run on BTC. Some 20 teams are building Ordinal-based applications for borrowing, lending, decentralized exchanges, and stablecoins.
The Layer 1 Foundation is also developing a programmable module for the BRC-20 metaprotocol, which stores executable code directly on the Bitcoin blockchain. 
This approach is said to take advantage of BTC’s relatively longer block confirmation times, 10 minutes (compared to Ethereum’s 12 seconds), to enable more complex computations. 
Can Bitcoin’s DeFi Ecosystem Eclipse Ethereum?
Despite these advances, not everyone is convinced that Bitcoin’s programmability will be the key to its next rally. Jeff Garzik, a former BTC core developer, believes that layer 2 scaling solutions will ultimately win out because they can offer cheaper transaction costs than running applications natively on the network.
Still, proponents of programmable BTC are betting that this new wave of decentralized finance (DeFi) applications could be a major driver of growth. Toby Lewis, founder of OrdinalsBot stated on the matter: 
Bitcoin’s DeFi ecosystem could grow to the largest in all of crypto. It is possible that the Bitcoin DeFi ecosystem could grow to trillions of dollars of market cap over the next few years, and it appears to be one of the major drivers of growth in crypto this cycle.


If these predictions come to fruition, the community may have found the long-awaited catalyst to ignite the cryptocurrency’s next major price surge.

As of press time, the largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, trades at $67,300, up by over 7% in the past seven days.

Binance Warns Against Low Float/High Valuation Coins, Puts Out Call for Small Projects With Strong Fundamentals - The Daily Hodl


								Binance, the largest crypto exchange in the world, is speaking out against the trend of new projects listing with low float and high fully diluted valuations (FDVs).
Float refers to the amount of circulating tokens while the the FDV refers to the market capitalization if 100% of the maximum supply of tokens are taken into account.










The combination of low float and high FDV may result in overly high sell pressure in the future and therefore be unfavorable to retail investors.
Says Binance,
“In recent months, we have observed a trend of tokens launching at high valuations with low initial circulating supplies…
To foster a healthy industry with a variety of market participants, including projects with lower to medium valuations, Binance is taking the lead to engage small to medium projects…
Launching tokens at a high fully diluted valuation and low circulating supply can result in dilutions from future unlocks which can place selling pressure on tokens. Such a market structure can be unfavorable for retail investors and loyal community members of the project. We are committed to reshaping this trend and fostering a more diverse market environment for our users and for all market participants.”
The exchange also wrote a full report on the topic called “Low Float & High FDV: How Did We Get Here?”
In response to the issue, Binance says it is putting out a call for “small to medium valuation relative to competitors in their respective sectors” to apply for possible listing on the exchange.
Projects from any sector are welcome to apply but should have significant token allocation reserved for community users, “moderate” token float during token generation events, and smaller allocations to non-community users.
“Actively supporting small to medium capitalization projects is one of our approaches to mitigate some of the risks that we have observed in certain aspects of the market. We invite all eligible projects to apply for listing with Binance, as we collectively strive to foster a more balanced and robust market environment.”

Grayscale CEO Michael Sonnenshein To Step Down In Leadership Shake-Up ⋆ ZyCrypto

&nbsp

&nbsp
A seismic shake-up in Grayscale’s top leadership has occurred. CEO Michael Sonnenshein stepped down after a decade of leadership. Starting on August 15, Peter Mintzberg of Goldman Sachs will succeed Sonnenshein.



Grayscale Appoints TradFi Veteran As New CEO



Grayscale CEO Michael Sonnenshein has departed from his role to “pursue other interests.” Sonnenshein joined Grayscale in 2014 as an account executive and became CEO in 2021.



“It has been an honor and a privilege to work alongside such smart, passionate people to grow Grayscale into an industry titan over the last decade,” Sonnenshein said in a company release. “I would like to thank Barry Silbert for his vision and partnership and for entrusting me to lead Grayscale’s business. The crypto asset class is at an important inflection point and this is the right moment for a smooth transition.”







Peter Mintzberg will serve as the company’s chief executive officer on August 15, 2024, and will join Grayscale’s board of directors. Before joining Grayscale, Mintzberg served as Goldman Sachs’ global head of strategy for asset and wealth management. He has over 20 years of experience in the traditional finance sector, having previously worked at prominent investment firms, including BlackRock, OppenheimerFunds, and Invesco.



Speaking on Sonnenshein’s departure, Barry Silbert, CEO of Grayscale’s parent company, Digital Currency Group stated:

&nbsp



“I want to thank Sonnenshein during his 10 years at Grayscale. Michael guided the firm through exponential growth and oversaw its pivotal role in bringing spot bitcoins ETFs to the market, leading the way for the broader financial industry. We wish him the best in his future endeavors.”



Grayscale’s Spot ETF



In mid-January, Grayscale was one of 11 companies to finally get a regulatory green light from the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to list spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) in the United States. The firm had sued the SEC over the agency’s frequent denials to allow it to transform its Bitcoin Trust (GBTC), then a closed-end fund, into an ETF.



Grayscale’s GBTC is currently the largest BTC ETF with $19.37 billion of assets under management. Notably, GBTC hemorrhaged over $15 billion in three months as the company held fees higher than its rivals. However, Grayscale started witnessing inflows in early May, snapping a 78-day streak of outflows.



Bloomberg’s senior ETF analyst Eric Balchunas described the CEO switch as a “big shakeup at Grayscale,” adding that “they were just beginning to see inflows again too! Curious the story behind this.”

                        XLink announced a partnership with cybersecurity firm Kaamel Technology on May 20. The collaboration will thoroughly investigate the ‘root cause’ of a data breach on May 15 that involved nearly $10 million of user funds.XLink stated that Kaamel Technology would conduct a ‘deep investigation’ and take measures to ‘eliminate vulnerabilities and prevent future misconduct.’Bitcoin Bridge XLink Partners with Kaamel Technology Following Security Breach
XLink disclosed that it has “accelerated” collaborations with cybersecurity firms to strengthen the platform’s defenses against future breaches. To enhance its security measures further, XLink is expediting its partnership with Ancilia Inc. to boost “real-time on-chain monitoring infrastructure.” Ancilia played an important role in the recent incident by alerting XLink to the attack, allowing the bridge provider to take swift actions that prevented additional fund losses.Additionally, XLink is collaborating with Cobo, its BTC custodian, to expand its setup and expedite migrating its web3 key management to the Cobo MPC infrastructure. XLink emphasized that in addition to its partnerships with Cobo, Ancilia, and Kaamel Technology, it plans to announce further partnerships in the future as part of its efforts to enhance the security of its platform.XLink Recovers Stolen Assets
XLink’s security breach involved its Ethereum and Binance Smart Chain (BSC) endpoints. The breach saw around $4.3 million lost after the attacker obtained private keys through a phishing scheme. Swift action by a white hat hacker led to the recovery of the stolen assets, however.The company clarified that the exploit only affected the BSC and Ethereum endpoints, with other endpoints remaining secure. Responding to the breach, XLink promptly suspended all operations on the bridge to facilitate a thorough investigation in partnership with security experts and liaisons from Binance. The company urged users who interacted with the compromised contracts to revoke any approved spending limits as a precautionary measure to mitigate further risks.In a related incident, Bitcoin layer-2 developer Alex Labs, the creator of the XLink bridge, suffered a separate attack on May 15. Due to compromised private keys, the attacker stole approximately $13.7 million in Stacks (STX) tokens.

Why Every New JPMorgan Will Get Trained in Prompt Engineering | Cryptoglobe


                                
JPMorgan Chase & Co. is now providing artificial intelligence training to every new banking employee. This initiative is spearheaded by the firm’s Chairman and CEO, Jamie Dimon, who has compared the revolutionary potential of AI to that of the printing press and steam engine.



According to an article by Bloomberg News, earlier today, at the firm’s recent investor day, Mary Erdoes, head of the asset and wealth management division, announced that all incoming employees will receive prompt engineering training to prepare them for the future of AI. Erdoes emphasized that AI is making substantial contributions in her division by saving time and boosting revenue. She said that AI is enhancing efficiency by streamlining the process of retrieving information on potential investments during client calls and eliminating monotonous, repetitive tasks. Erdoes noted that some analysts have already saved two to four hours of their workdays thanks to these advancements.



Daniel Pinto, the financial giant’s President and Chief Operating Officer, highlighted the financial significance of this emerging technology, estimating its value to the firm at between $1 billion and $1.5 billion. AI is poised to have a profound impact on JPMorgan’s workforce, particularly its 60,000 developers and 80,000 operations and call centre employees, nearly half of the company’s total staff.



In a symbolic gesture of AI’s pervasive influence at JPMorgan, Erdoes began her presentation with the accompaniment of a song generated by feeding the slide deck into a large-language model. This underscores the extent to which AI has been integrated into the company’s culture and daily operations.







            
            

            
            

            
            

        

According to CNBC, on 12 March, Jamie Dimon shared his views on Bitcoin and artificial intelligence at the Australian Financial Review Business Summit.



Dimon, known for his critical stance on Bitcoin, remained skeptical about its practical uses. He suggested that much of Bitcoin’s usage is tied to illicit activities. Nonetheless, he defended the right to purchase Bitcoin, stating, “I don’t know what the bitcoin itself is for, but I defend your right to smoke a cigarette, I’ll defend your right to buy a bitcoin. I won’t personally ever buy a bitcoin.”



CNBC also highlighted Dimon’s comments on artificial intelligence (AI) and its role at JPMorgan. He revealed that the bank employs 2,000 people working on 400 AI technology use cases. Dimon mentioned that he personally uses AI at home to summarize books he doesn’t have time to read.



In an interview with CNBC’s Leslie Picker at J.P. Morgan’s 2024 Global Emerging Markets Corporate Conference (26-28 February 2024) in Miami, Dimon emphasized his strong belief in AI’s revolutionary impact, stating that it is not just hype but a real game-changer. He contrasted current AI advancements with the late 1990s tech bubble, noting that AI’s practical applications are already being implemented within JPMorgan. The firm’s dedication to AI is demonstrated by its team of over 200 researchers who are investigating the potential of large language models to drive innovation in areas like cybersecurity and pharmaceutical research.

Cryptocurrency Market Soars - Ethereum Up 7 Percent in Minutes, Bitcoin Tops $69,000 - What's Happening? - Bitcoin Sistemi


The cryptocurrency market faced a sudden rise.
Bloomberg analysts Eric Balchunas and James Seyffart, who were previously extremely pessimistic about the approval of Ethereum Spot ETFs by the SEC, announced in their latest update that they had received some information and increased the probability of approval to 75%.


Analysts said that the reason they limited the approval probability to 75% was not to rush before possible filings in the coming days. So analysts' sentiments can be extremely strong.
However, after this news, the Ethereum price experienced a surge and increased by approximately 7% within minutes.







On the other hand, there were signs of increase in the price of Bitcoin, although not as much as Ethereum. The world's largest cryptocurrency has gained 2% in value in the last hour and is trading at $69,900 at the time of writing, according to CoinMarketCap data.



When the liquidation data is examined, it is seen that there has been a liquidation of 85 million dollars in the cryptocurrency market in the last hour. 80 million dollars of liquidations occurred in short positions. While Ethereum experienced a liquidation of 33 million dollars, the amount in Bitcoin was 30 million dollars.

Cardano Could Be Crypto's Next Big Comeback Story As Fat Whale Wallets Eye $1 ADA Price ⋆ ZyCrypto

&nbsp

&nbsp
Significant moves by major investors often signal upcoming shifts in the crypto market. Recently, Cardano (ADA) has caught the attention of these large-scale investors, commonly known as “whales.” This renewed interest could trigger a substantial comeback for the 10th biggest cryptocurrency.



Cardano Whales Increase Holdings



Data from IntoTheBlock shows a significant trend: Cardano whales, holding more than 100 million ADA tokens, increased their holdings by 11% last month. They now control almost 7% of Cardano’s entire supply. This accumulation is typically considered bullish, indicating that these influential investors are adjusting their positions and buying more promising projects.



It’s not just the whales that are showing confidence in Cardano. Retail investors are also involved in the bullish momentum. More data from IntoTheBlock highlights ADA’s positive bid-ask volume imbalance, indicating that buying pressure exceeds selling pressure. Additionally, the ‘In The Money’ metric, which measures the profitability of current holders, has flipped positively.



Growing Confidence in Cardano’s Ecosystem



Beyond investor sentiment, the overall confidence in the Cardano ecosystem is rising. According to DeFiLlama, the Total Value Locked (TVL) on Cardano increased by more than 5% in the last week. TVL is a critical metric in the DeFi space, reflecting the total value of assets staked or locked in the network’s smart contracts.



Moreover, Cardano’s trading volume has significantly risen. Higher trading volumes generally suggest greater market activity and interest, which may raise prices.

Analysts Predict a Bullish Future for Cardano



Several prominent crypto analysts are forecasting a substantial rally for Cardano. An analyst known as World of Charts has noted that ADA’s breakout is confirmed, and the token is moving accordingly. The analyst expects Cardano to reach $1 in the next few weeks.



Similarly, another analyst, Trend Rider, has identified a bullish pattern for Cardano. They noted a jump in ADA’s price following a bullish signal on the daily chart and expect ADA to hold above the $0.5 level in the short term.



Dan Gambardello, founder of Crypto Capital Venture, also shared his opinion on Cardano’s price movements. He pointed out that ADA is exceeding its 20-day moving average (MA). Gambardello mentioned the formation of a golden cross on Cardano’s daily chart – where the 50-day MA crosses above the 200-day MA.



The resurgence of whale activity, strong retail investor interest, and growing confidence in Cardano’s ecosystem paint a promising picture for ADA. The combination of these factors and bullish predictions from several analysts indicate that Cardano could be on the verge of a significant comeback.

Shiba Inu’s Shibarium Sees Massive Drop In Interest As Transaction Volume Crashes 90%, What’s Going On? | Bitcoinist.com


								Shibarium, the Layer 2 network from the Shiba Inu team, has seen its performance come under the spotlight, given the recent change in fortune. Considering how integral the network’s success is to Shiba Inu’s (SHIB) growth, this development has undoubtedly been a cause for concern among members of the SHIB community. 
Shibarium’s Daily Transactions Declines By Over 90%
Data from Shibariumscan shows that the daily transactions on Shibarium have declined by over 90% since hitting a recent high of 121,000 transactions recorded on April 19. On May 19, the layer-2 network recorded a daily transaction of just over 11,000. This has been the trend for a while now, with May 3 being the only time the layer-2 network recorded a daily transaction above 20,000 this month. 

Shibarium’s decline is worrisome, especially considering the immense success the layer-2 network recorded at the end of last year. In December 2023, Shibarium averaged over 7 million transactions for most of the month. However, things began to go downhill from the beginning of the year when Shibarium’s daily transactions crashed by almost 50%. 
Meanwhile, Shibarium’s underperformance cannot be ignored, given its role in Shiba Inu’s growth. Since the layer-2 network launched, the Shibarium team has committed to using some transaction fees earned to carry out SHIB burns. Thanks to this, over 33.8 billion SHIB tokens were burned in December when Shibarium achieved its peak success. 
However, the decline in the number of daily transactions on the Shibarium network has reduced the amount of transaction fees earned, ultimately affecting the number of SHIB burns carried out by the network. This has caused SHIB’s burn rate to drop significantly as of late, with tokens burnt weekly nowhere close to the amount burned when Shibarium was on a high. 
Shiba Inu Has Continued To Shine Regardless
Despite Shibarium’s underperformance since the start of the year, Shiba Inu has still made significant price gains. The meme coin currently boasts a year-to-date (YTD) gain of over 131% and is among the best-performing crypto assets this year. Shiba Inu’s impressive performance this year has been mainly thanks to its fundamentals, with the Shiba Inu team actively working on ways to improve the ecosystem. 

Shiba Inu has also been a huge beneficiary of the meme coin narrative, with this category of crypto tokens projected to be one of the leading narratives in this bull run. Meanwhile, from a technical analysis perspective, crypto analysts have also offered a bullish outlook for Shiba Inu, predicting that the meme coin will hit a new all-time high in this market cycle. 
Therefore, Shiba Inu is still expected to enjoy further price surges as this bull run progresses. However, there is no doubt that an increase in Shibarium’s daily transactions could provide more bullish momentum for the second-largest meme coin by market cap.

Kennedy Airport in New York on May 18 and charged with operating Incognito Market, a so-called dark web service accessible only through encrypted and obfuscated channels that allowed buyers and sellers to conduct illegal transactions anonymously.In a 15-count indictment unsealed Monday in the Southern District of New York, Lin faces charges including engaging in a continuing criminal enterprise, narcotics conspiracy, and money laundering. The most serious charge carries a mandatory minimum sentence of life in prison."As alleged, Rui-Siang Lin operated a sophisticated and dangerous online narcotics marketplace through which he profited millions of dollars at the community's expense," U.S. Attorney Damian Williams said in a news release. "The dedicated prosecutors from the Southern District of New York and our law enforcement partners will pursue criminal actors regardless of whether they operate on street corners or in the dark corners of the internet."According to a criminal complaint, the Incognito Market launched in October 2020 and operated until March 2024, facilitating sales of heroin, cocaine, LSD, MDMA, oxycodone, methamphetamines, ketamine and alprazolam, among other substances.

New Statements from Analysts Giving the Good News that Ethereum Spot ETFs Will Most Likely Be Approved! When Will ETFs Be Traded? - Bitcoin Sistemi


Bloomberg analysts Eric Balchunas and James Seyffart, who announced minutes ago that the approval probability of Ethereum Spot ETFs increased from 25% to 75%, published a new statement.
Analysts shared that they had received new information and thought that the SEC could make a 180-degree turn regarding the Ethereum Spot ETF.


In his post minutes ago following the previous announcement, James Seyffart stated that the 75% rate in question was for 19-b forms, which had a final decision date of May 23. May 23 is known as the deadline for the SEC to decide whether to reject or approve VanEck's Spot ETH ETF application.

Seyffart said that the possible approval on May 23 should be followed by S-1 approvals. According to the analyst, this second approval may take weeks or months to arrive. So, the analyst says that it still takes time for Ethereum Spot ETFs to open for trading.





However, Seyffart stated that if they are proven right and the 19-b approvals come, the S-1 approvals will no longer be an “if scenario” but a “when scenario”, meaning their approval will be finalized.
In summary, both 19b-4 and S-1 approvals are required for a crypto spot ETF to fully operate in the market. Form 19b-4 allows the ETF to be listed on a trading platform, while registration S-1 allows it to be sold to the public.

Charles Hoskinson: ‘Under the Trump Administration, We Founded and Built Cardano’ | Cryptoglobe


                                
In a recent video titled “Humility,” Charles Hoskinson, Co-Founder and CEO of IOG (Input Output Global), shared his insights on humility, the current political landscape in the United States, and its implications for the cryptocurrency industry. This blog post delves into Hoskinson’s key points, especially his views on former President Donald Trump and current President Joe Biden, as well as his call to action for the 2024 election.



Hoskinson starts by addressing a Reddit post that critiques him for lacking humility. He clarifies that while he strives to be a decent person who acknowledges others’ contributions, true humility involves recognizing the value of viewpoints other than one’s own. He admits that his logical, mathematical mindset can sometimes obscure the complexities of real-world perspectives.



The Reddit post suggests that Hoskinson struggles with admitting the validity of differing viewpoints. It argues that his approach to logical reasoning might lead to a misunderstanding of the nature of reality and other perspectives. Hoskinson agrees that humility is about recognizing potential misperceptions and valuing other viewpoints.



Hoskinson criticizes the Biden administration for its definitive anti-crypto stance. He attributes this position to a deal made between Biden and Senator Elizabeth Warren during the 2020 presidential campaign. Warren, a staunch opponent of cryptocurrency, was given control over domestic treasury policy, leading to the appointment of many anti-crypto officials in the Treasury Department.



He highlights the administration’s systematic efforts to unbank cryptocurrency companies, evidenced by Wells notices against major players like Robinhood, Coinbase, Uniswap, Kraken, and Binance. Hoskinson points out a clear trend of hostility towards the industry.



Despite the cryptocurrency industry’s extensive efforts to engage with the Biden administration through meetings, open letters, and private discussions, Hoskinson believes the administration remains unyielding and duplicitous. While claiming to be open to dialogue, the administration has aggressively worked to undermine the industry.







            
            

            
            

            
            

        

Hoskinson asserts that the Biden administration’s policies have created significant challenges for the cryptocurrency industry, including driving businesses abroad and treating crypto users as criminals.



Hoskinson contrasts the Biden administration’s hostility with the relatively neutral stance of the Trump administration. While the Trump administration did not provide regulatory clarity, it did not exhibit the same level of adversarial actions toward the cryptocurrency industry.



Hoskinson suggests that a potential Trump victory in the next election might not lead to the same level of hostility towards the industry as seen under Biden. However, he emphasizes the importance of electing pro-crypto candidates regardless of their party affiliation.



Hoskinson endorses Robert F. Kennedy Jr. (RFK) for the presidency, arguing that the American people deserve better leadership than what is currently offered by both Trump and Biden. He believes RFK represents a much-needed alternative.



Hoskinson stresses the importance of the 2024 election for the future of the cryptocurrency industry. He argues that the political consequences of opposing cryptocurrency should be made clear. If anti-crypto stances result in electoral losses, politicians will be forced to reconsider their positions.



Hoskinson argues that the issue at hand is not about humility but about policy. The cryptocurrency industry has consistently approached the government with humility, presenting well-reasoned arguments and data. However, the administration’s actions suggest a predetermined decision to oppose cryptocurrency, regardless of the industry’s efforts.



In his closing remarks, Hoskinson calls on the cryptocurrency community to vote for pro-crypto candidates in the 2024 election, regardless of their political affiliation. He emphasizes the importance of preserving liberty and freedom and urges the community to fight for a better future.

Bitcoin punches above $70K, on brink of second breakout in months - Crypto Briefing


            
            
                            
            
                            
            
            Bitcoin has once again breached the $70,000 mark, reaching $70,225 per coin for the first time in over a month, marking its highest level since April 12.The 6% surge in 24 hours, as reported by CoinGecko, highlights a strong bullish sentiment from investors flooding newly approved spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) with capital.The recent surge in Bitcoin’s price comes as positive market sentiment and institutional interest grow. The upward trajectory began in late February, with Bitcoin rising from around $47,500 to approximately $55,000 by early March. This initial rise was followed by a period of bullish momentum, with the alpha crypto peaking at roughly $62,500 before the week closed. As the second week of March came in, Bitcoin reached the $70k level.This peak represented a period of intense buying activity and market enthusiasm, driven by speculation and heightened interest in the crypto market.Today’s surge to $70,225, influenced by the US Bureau of Labor Statistics report showing lower-than-expected inflation in April, suggests that the Federal Reserve might cut interest rates, making assets like Bitcoin more attractive compared to traditional investments.The general trend from February to May indicates a bullish market sentiment, with significant price increases and sustained periods of high trading volume. Over the past 24 hours, over $235 million in crypto positions were liquidated, with $63 million in Bitcoin short positions alone, highlighting the intense market activity and investor optimism.The recent speculation that the SEC might approve spot Ethereum ETFs with a 75% chance has also contributed to the bullish momentum.

BREAKING: More Good News About Ethereum Spot ETFs - SEC Accelerates the Process - Approval Could Come Before Thursday - Bitcoin Sistemi


The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) is reportedly urging exchanges to expedite the update of 19b-4 filings for Ethereum Spot ETFs, according to three sources familiar with the matter cited by Coindesk. According to sources, this move indicates that the SEC may be aiming to approve these applications before a key deadline this Thursday.

However, this does not necessarily mean that Ethereum Spot ETFs will be authorized. Potential issuers also need to have their S-1 applications approved before the products can begin trading. It could take an indefinite period of time for the SEC to approve the S-1 filings because there is no set deadline for the process, a person familiar with the matter said.

Could Eric Balchunas and James Seyffart, Who Announced Ethereum Spot ETF Good News, Have Been Hacked? They Released a Statement - Bitcoin Sistemi


Two Bloomberg analysts, who shared that the approval possibilities of Ethereum Spot ETF applications, which made a big impact in the cryptocurrency market, were strengthened, had to publish a statement.
This positive news, which deeply affected the market, was approached with caution due to the previous experiences of the cryptocurrency market. However, two analysts stated in their statement published on X that their accounts were not hacked. James Seyffart, one of the analysts who shared that Ethereum Spot ETFs could be approved, announced that neither he nor fellow analyst Eric Balchunas were hacked.



He stated that the development was also confirmed by another cryptocurrency journalist, Eleanor Terrett.
In her statement, Eleanor Terrett said that a representative of one of the applicant companies contacted her and that things were “changing in real time” within the busy agenda. So, it was confirmed by Terrett that there has been some change in the SEC's stance regarding these Spot ETFs.

Don't Buy That Hot New Token | Bankless


Don’t Ape That. Prolific pseudonymous crypto trader “Cobie” has been largely absent from industry discourse in recent months but returned yesterday, publishing a lengthy screed to his blog discussing the issues and misconceptions surrounding new token launches. Why does Cobie think new tokens are going down-only from here?Despite Cobie’s hopes that crypto market participants would have become more sophisticated when investing in low-float, high-FDV tokens (crypto assets that have only a small percentage of their total supply available for trading), retail capital continues to blindly flock to these tokens, with traders seemingly forsaking the lessons they should have learned from the damage wrought by unlocks during the 2021-2022 bear market.Crypto valuations have swelled from the industry’s nascent days alongside increasing demand for the technology and proven returns for blue chip assets like BTC and ETH, but a glaring divergence has formed between the returns available to public and private investors.Why This Cycle Is Cooked on BanklessThe ‘points’ meta isn’t sustainable.Ethereum ICO participant returns are only 1.5x better off than those who purchased at the lowest publicly traded price, but investors in Solana’s seed rounds have enjoyed 10x higher returns than those available on public markets…Optimism’s initial private investors bagged 30x higher returns than public market participants. Meanwhile, practically every public market purchaser of STARK is underwater as seed investors flaunt 138x paper gains!Source: Cobie's SubstackPurchasing Solana at a $5B FDV in December 2022 was arguably one of the best liquid token plays of the post-COVID era, but this depressed valuation was only achieved through the excoriation of FTX; increasingly, it appears that crypto alpha has come to be entirely captured by private market participants.Although the presence of a low float itself is not necessarily problematic, the reduced capital required to pin such tokens at high valuations leaves them liable to be easily manipulated and distorted by bad actors. As uninformed token buyers purchase low-float tokens on the public market with the expectation of future profit, they are blind to the fact that price discovery has already taken place in a private market that is either rigged, delusional, or both.Prior to the public market launch of tokens, valuations are not yet in price discovery mode, instead reaching the maximum price private market investors are willing to pay. Once tokens begin trading in public markets, dislocations can occur between the prices uneducated public market-restricted retail buyers are willing to pay and the alternative prices sophisticated investors can pay through private markets.Cobie claims that it's currently impossible to “be early” to contemporary token launches when all of the near-term upside has already been captured by private market participants and advises investors to simply opt out of playing the games insiders use to inflate their FDVs by simply not purchasing new tokens, even if they believe the project is good.While it was Cobie’s Substack article that turbocharged the debate on low float, high FDV tokens, Dragonfly Capital managing partner Haseeb Qureshi also addressed the topic via long-form Twitter post.
 In his analysis, Qureshi addresses three of the leading hypotheses for why these tokens are dumping: insiders dumping on retail, retail is rage quitting to buy memecoins, and there is too little supply to have meaningful price discovery.After providing evidence to reject each of these explanations, Qureshi comes to the conclusion that there is simply nothing to do, as the free market will eventually force valuations to come back into balance with fundamentals.Crypto’s alt markets went into risk-off mode in the middle of April, seemingly on fears of elevating Middle Eastern conflict, a fact clearly evidenced through the steep declines experienced by many of crypto’s newest tokens since this ominous turning point.FOMO is a powerful force that compels investors to ape the newest tokens with the shiniest narratives, but unfortunately, it appears that demand for these assets dried up last month and prices must further digest inevitable unlocks before alts can yet again outperform.Source: TradingView

$ADA: The Centralization Debate Surrounding Cardano’s Genesis Keys | Cryptoglobe


                                
Recently, a heated debate has emerged within the Cardano community concerning the centralization implications of its “genesis keys.” Earlier today, Justin Bons, Founder and CIO of Cyber Capital, sparked the discussion with a series of posts on social media platform X, where he highlighted the centralized control these keys afford to Input Output Global (IOG), one of the three organizations responsible for Cardano’s research and development.



Bons’ Critique of Cardano’s Centralization



Bons’ thread began with a stark assertion that Cardano (ADA) possesses “genesis keys,” a multi-signature setup that controls all protocol rules. He argued that ADA’s claim of being the “most decentralized” chain is contradicted by this centralized feature, as IOG controls five out of seven keys, allowing them to unilaterally change the protocol. Bons emphasized the irony in ADA’s claims of decentralization.



In his second post, Bons elaborated on the power these keys grant, allowing code changes without the need for a hard fork. He warned that IOG could potentially halt the chain, alter emission schedules, or censor transactions, which he described as an unprecedented level of centralized control for a Layer 1 blockchain.



Bons traced the origin of these keys to the Shelley update in 2020. Initially, IOG did not have absolute control; however, one of the other key holders, the Cardano Foundation (CF), delegated their control to IOG, granting them full authority. Bons criticized this design, arguing that even requiring IOG to gain the support of only one of two other parties was insufficiently decentralized.



While acknowledging Cardano’s efforts towards on-chain governance with the Voltaire upgrade, Bons noted that the genesis keys still render ADA centralized at present. He concluded by urging the community to “verify, not trust,” highlighting the importance of scrutinizing such centralized mechanisms.



Cardano YODA’s Response



Cardano influencer “Cardano YODA” responded to Bons with a detailed clarification, aiming to correct what he saw as misconceptions. He explained that fundamental protocol changes in Cardano must first be accepted by full node operators who install the new version of the client. Genesis keys, he noted, are merely a tool to trigger a hard fork, and cannot initiate changes without broad community support.



YODA pointed out that the genesis keys are used to adjust protocol parameters such as staking rewards or block size, always with community approval. He cited an example where a vote preceded the lowering of the fixed reward minimum from 340 ADA to 170 ADA, emphasizing transparency in the process.







            
            

            
            

            
            

        

He defended the genesis keys as a flexible and smart solution, arguing that they allow for necessary adjustments without the need for extensive new code development and testing. Furthermore, YODA asserted that genesis keys cannot censor transactions, steal user funds, or halt consensus, as these are protected by users’ private keys.



YODA concluded by noting that Cardano’s governance will soon transition to the community, with genesis keys losing their functionality. Roles currently held by IOG, CF, and Emurgo will be replaced by decentralized representatives (DReps), enabling more distributed decision-making.



Bons’ Rebuttal



In his response, Bons expressed appreciation for YODA’s detailed explanation but maintained his stance on the centralization issue. He acknowledged that validators must install new versions of the client but pointed out that most blockchains set a fork to activate at a specific block height, unlike Cardano’s centralized multi-signature trigger.



Bons reiterated that while he never claimed genesis keys could steal user funds, they do have the potential to set ADA’s capacity to zero, effectively censoring all usage. He welcomed the move towards decentralization and expressed eagerness to analyze ADA’s on-chain governance once fully implemented.



The Broader Implications



YODA replied by comparing Cardano’s hard fork process to Bitcoin’s, noting similarities in how changes are implemented and activated. He argued that the real measure of decentralization lies in the number of operators making decisions. While Bitcoin’s consensus can be influenced by a few dominant pools, Cardano involves hundreds of operators and stakers, which he believes is more indicative of decentralization.



This debate underscores a critical issue in the blockchain community: the balance between flexibility and decentralization. While genesis keys offer a practical solution for protocol adjustments, their centralized nature raises concerns. Cardano’s commitment to transitioning towards a more decentralized governance model is a positive step, but the community will need to remain vigilant to ensure these changes promote true decentralization.

Ethereum Soars As ETF Analysts Increase Odds for ETH ETF Approval To 75% - The Defiant

Bloomberg analyst Eric Balchunas said he “heard chatter” the SEC could be reversing their stance.
Two of the industry’s top ETF analysts have increased the likelihood of a spot Ethereum ETF approval to 75% from 25% as the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) approaches its May 23 deadline to respond to the first applications.Blackrock and Fidelity are the first to receive a response from the SEC.According to Bloomberg analysts Eric Balchunas and Jeff Seyffart, the increase is due to Balchunas “hearing chatter this afternoon that the SEC could do a 180.” He said ETF filings have become increasingly a political issue.Ethereum soared by more than 12% to $3,428 as speculation mounts. The token is approaching the $3,500 mark for the first time since early April. ETH Price - CoinGeckoMeanwhile, Grayscale’s Ethereum ETF fund has spiked even more, flying 23% now trading for $28.80. But ETH isn’t alone in its price action, and has sent the entire crypto market flying. Bitcoin jumped 5% as it approaches the $70,000 mark.After the spot Bitcoin ETFs took nearly ten years to get approved, analysts remained mostly bearish that the Ethereum ETF could take a more expedited route. But that appears to have changed, and has caught most off guard, including Balchunas and his colleague Seyffart.“Now everyone is scrambling (like us, everyone else assumed they’d be denied),” he posted on X, adding that they have capped the likelihood at 75% pending more information, and updates on filings.Several of the world’s largest asset managers have filed for a spot Ethereum ETF. The latest was $1.6 trillion fund Franklin Templeton, who joined $4.6 trillion Fidelity which had recently added ETH staking to its filing.

Bitcoin is rapidly heading towards $70k

A month after its ‘halving’ and in the midst of Bitcoin Pizza Day this week, the leading cryptocurrency seems to be in the mood for celebration. Spirit Airlines drops change and cancellation feesBitcoin was trading around $68,000 on Monday, which was up 3.4% in the last 24 hours and over 9% in the past week. Bitcoin’s all-time high is $73,835, which it reached on March 14, 2024.Ether, the second-largest cryptocurrency by market cap, followed suit, hovering around $3,100, with a 3% gain. Solana, also known as ‘ethereum-killer,’ saw more than a 6% jump Monday, to $180, meaning it now has jumped over 21% in a week. Top memecoins Dogecoin and Shiba Inu saw modest jumps of over 2% each. Overall, the global cryptocurrency market was up nearly 3% on Monday, standing at $2.47 trillion, according to CoinMarketCap.The surge in the crypto market is primarily driven by macroeconomic factors, such as the ease in the inflation rate. Meanwhile, gold hit a record high on Monday, causing analysts to speculate about how it reached the new peak and whether Bitcoin will surpass its all-time high mark.Possibly, the answer lies in the mining of metals and cryptocurrencies, said Neil Roarty, an analyst at investment platform Stocklytics.“The cost of extracting gold from the ground has been rising steadily due to various factors, including disrupted supply chains and Russia’s invasion of Ukraine,” he said. “Meanwhile, Bitcoin’s recent halving event reduced the rewards Bitcoin miners receive by 50% in April. “With political uncertainty and the promise of falling interest rates likely to sustain demand for both categories, the rising cost of supply should give the bulls of both camps reason to be optimistic.”In addition, spot Bitcoin ETFs have been performing well the past few days. According to industry tracker Farside, investors have been putting money into the various spot Bitcoin ETFs since May 15. Even Grayscale’s GBTC, which was in the red for months, was also receiving funds from investors.Since May 1, BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust, or IBIT, has seen an inflow of $15 billion, followed by Fidelity’s FBTC with $8.4 billion, ARK 21Shares’s Bitcoin ETF ARK with $2.4 billion, and Bitwise’s BITB with $1.8 billion, per Farside.

Bitcoin Price Hits $70,000 as Crypto Liquidations Top $235 Million - Decrypt

We do the research, you get the alpha!Get exclusive reports and access to key insights on airdrops, NFTs, and more! Subscribe now to Alpha Reports and up your game!Go to Alpha ReportsBitcoin has passed the $70,000 mark for the first time in more than a month, since April 12. The price of the biggest digital asset is now at $70,225 per coin, data from CoinGecko shows, jumping 6% in 24 hours. And crypto liquidations are surging as a result, with short positions dominating the carnage.The asset's rise comes as investors again flood the newly approved spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) with money following weeks of outflows. Data on Monday showed that nearly $1 billion hit the new funds, which give investors exposure to the biggest digital asset.The flood of investment comes after the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics last week showed that inflation wasn't as high as expected in April in a report.People invest in assets like Bitcoin if inflation is low, because it means the Federal Reserve will be more likely to cut interest rates—which stand at a 23-year high.The cryptocurrency's surge today means that most other coins and tokens are shooting up in price. Traders betting on the price of the digital assets going down are therefore having their positions liquidated: in the past 24 hours, over $235 million in positions have been closed, CoinGlass data shows.Some $63 million of that number is in Bitcoin short positions alone, part of $173 million in total crypto shorts liquidated over the past 24 hours.Bitcoin in March touched a new all-time high of $73,737. It is now just 5% below that level. The coin's run appears to be mostly due to the new Bitcoin ETFs, which trade on traditional stock exchanges and allow investors to buy shares which track the price of the asset.However, there may also be residual effects from the sudden price spike that Ethereum also just experienced on Monday afternoon, amid fresh speculation from analysts that an SEC approval of spot Ethereum ETFs is likely to happen this week.Edited by Andrew HaywardDisclaimerThe views and opinions expressed by the author are for informational purposes only and do not constitute financial, investment, or other advice.Daily Debrief NewsletterStart every day with the top news stories right now, plus original features, a podcast, videos and more.

Analysis Company Announces: "These 12 Altcoins Have a High Degree of Dump Alert" - Bitcoin Sistemi


In a recent study, DYθR published a comprehensive analysis of venture capital (VC) exposure across a range of projects. The study focuses on two key metrics: VC Dominance and dump pressure.
Venture Capital Dominance is determined by comparing the Investor Supply percentage with the median of the Investor Supply percentages. If the Investor Supply percentage is greater than the median, the altcoin is classified as having high VC Dominance. Conversely, if it is lower than the median value, the project has low VC Dominance.


Dump printing is rated based on Unrealized Profit expressed in multiples. Projects with Unrealized Profit greater than the median are categorized as having high dump pressure, while those with Unrealized Profit smaller than the median are considered to have low dump pressure.

The analysis revealed that projects such as Celestia, Ethena, REZ, OMNI, Altlayer, SEI and SAGA exhibited both high VC Dominance and high dump pressure.





On the other hand, projects like ZETA, Arkham, ONDO, Dymension and Pixels exhibit low VC Dominance but high dump pressure.

BTC surges 6% to touch $70k as Ethereum ETF rumors cause market frenzy

Bitcoin (BTC) surged past the $70,000 mark on May 21, marking a significant milestone driven by a flood of investment into spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) and a broader market rally.Bitcoin’s price climbed to $70,325, a 6% increase over 24 hours, before settling at $68,700 as of press time, based on CryptoSlate data.Ethereum (ETH) arguably led the rally over the past couple of hours — experiencing a staggering 14.5% rise within an hour on Monday amid speculation that the US SEC might approve spot Ethereum ETFs.ETH climbed from $3,143 to $3,518 as of press time.Renewed interestThe renewed interest in Bitcoin ETFs follows weeks of outflows, with nearly $1 billion flowing into these funds, providing investors with exposure to the leading digital asset.The surge has led to significant liquidations in the market, with over $235 million in positions closed in the past 24 hours, including $63 million in Bitcoin short positions alone, according to CoinGlass.Analysts indicate that most on-chain metrics suggest the beginning of a bull market despite some showing signs of potential peaking. The recent bounce near $60,000 has sparked renewed interest, with Farside Investors reporting approximately $950 million in inflows last week, a level not seen since March.Bitcoin’s 51% year-to-date gain reflects investors’ anticipation of US monetary expansion, evidenced by the M2 monetary base surpassing $21 trillion in April 2024. This increase in circulating money suggests rising inflationary pressures despite a period of company and individual spending hesitancy.Meanwhile, the Federal Reserve’s efforts to manage inflation and avoid a recession could affect liquidity and the attractiveness of assets like Bitcoin.ScarcityBitcoin reached a new all-time high of $73,737 in March and is now just 5% below that level. The recent run appears to be largely driven by the new Bitcoin ETFs, which trade on traditional stock exchanges and allow investors to buy shares that track the price of the asset.Supporting the bullish sentiment, Bitcoin reserves on major exchanges have dropped to a seven-year low. Data from CryptoQuant shows only 1,918,417 BTC available on major trading platforms as of May 19, a significant decrease from the previous year.This scarcity, coupled with the recent halving event that reduced the potential new supply from miners, makes a bearish outlook on Bitcoin increasingly difficult to justify.The crypto community continues to watch closely as Bitcoin’s price action unfolds, with many wondering whether the digital asset will continue its ascent or face a significant correction in the coming weeks.Bitcoin Market DataAt the time of press 11:11 pm UTC on May. 20, 2024, Bitcoin is ranked #1 by market cap and the price is up 4.93% over the past 24 hours.

Ethereum ETF Approval Incoming? | Bankless


Bloomberg’s ETF analysts have suddenly and unexpectedly increased their odds of spot ETH ETF approval from 25% to 75%!What’s the scoop?Renewed Communication: Senior Bloomberg ETF analyst Eric Balchunas claims that the SEC has suddenly reversed its decision to deny spot ETH ETFs, leading issuers to scramble to finalize applications ahead of the first final decision deadline on May 23.Politically Motivated: While the Biden Administration has adopted a radically anti-crypto policy stance in recent weeks, Balchunas points to the increasing politicization of crypto as the driving factor behind the sudden shift.Market Shock: Sentiment had been decidedly negative regarding Ether’s chances of spot ETF approval – with the market implied odds according on Polymarket indicating just an 11% chance of approval this morning – but this probability now stands above 50% for the first time since January as the ETH/BTC ratio is rebounding with strength.Bankless Take:Although Balchunas indicates that political pressure forced the SEC to cave on its denial stance, Ethereum's ETF approval appears to have been inevitable for many months. ETF experts previously extolled that a lack of meaningful communication between the SEC and proposed issuers was a red flag indicating denial, but the decision to approve spot products was likely already made when the regulator approved commodity futures-based ETH ETF products last October, solidifying Ether's status as a non-security. With the experts once again confident on approval, crypto market participants are coming to consensus that ETH ETF approval is likely certain to occur this Thursday.

Spot ether ETF decision week just got a bit more interesting - Blockworks


It’s spot ether ETF decision week — a pre-Memorial Day celebration of sorts for a certain segment of the crypto and financial communities.
Or a letdown. 
The lead-up to the ruling didn’t seem to carry the same buzz as the Securities and Exchange Commission’s verdict on BTC funds in January. 
That perhaps changed a bit Monday.
After weeks of industry watchers expressing doubts that the SEC was ready to approve such funds, Bloomberg analysts changed their SEC approval odds from 25% to 75%.

Ether rose above $3,500 just before 5 pm ET Monday — up about 14% on the day.
A person familiar with the spot ether ETF applications told Blockworks that “conversations are progressing.” They were granted anonymity given the sensitivity of the discussions. 
An SEC spokesperson declined to comment.
The Bloomberg analysts alluded to a potential regulatory change of stance given how crypto has appeared to become more of a political issue in recent days and weeks.  
Donald Trump has essentially promised to be a pro-crypto president if returned to the White House in the upcoming election. Then, 12 Democratic senators joined Republicans last week to pass a resolution to overturn the SEC’s Staff Accounting Bulletin (SAB) 121. The move could signal that more Democrats look to gain favor with pro-crypto voters the way Republicans historically have.  
Still, industry watchers have named several reasons they think the SEC might not be ready to allow spot ether ETFs to start trading. 
“Concerns over the liquidity of ETH’s spot and futures markets, along with its previous classification as a security by the SEC, contribute to skepticism about swift approval,” Fineqia International analyst Matteo Greco said in a Monday research note.
Read more: Why the SEC could choose to deny ether ETFs, and what could happen next
Others have pointed out the lack of SEC engagement with prospective issuers over the last weeks and months — a divergence from the many meetings the regulator had with fund firms ahead of the bitcoin ETF approvals.  
21Shares President Ophelia Snyder had previously countered that point, noting there was “less to look at” this time around given “how fresh most of the documentation is” following the bitcoin ETF approvals.
As the agency did with spot bitcoin ETFs, the SEC would have to approve the 19b-4 documents submitted by the stock exchanges on which these products would trade, as well as S-1 registration statements from the issuers.
The SEC is asking exchanges to update their 19b-4 documents “on an accelerated basis,” CoinDesk reported Monday, citing unnamed sources.
Nate Geraci, president of the ETF Store, said in an X post that the SEC could theoretically approve the 19b-4s and wait on greenlighting the S-1s as more engagement with issuers takes place. 
“This decision could be favorable for issuers, as traditional finance investors seem [to remain] strongly focused on BTC, potentially reducing market activity around ETH spot ETFs if launched next week,” Greco said in his research note.
Should the SEC reject the spot ether funds, issuers would need to re-submit their filings, restarting a 240-day clock. This could potentially lead to approval in this year’s fourth quarter, or in early 2025, Greco noted.  
Some lawyers have said issuers might look to sue the SEC if they reject the planned ether products given a court decision was what ultimately helped get US spot bitcoin ETFs to start trading.

After Bitcoin Climbs Above $70,000, Santiment Reports Increased Whale Activity in Two Altcoins - Bitcoin Sistemi


Cryptocurrency analysis platform Santiment, in its latest evaluation, drew attention to some altcoins after the market boomed.
With the emergence of statements that Ethereum Spot ETFs may be approved and these being confirmed by Bloomberg analysts Eric Balchunas and James Seyffart, it started to rise under the leadership of Ethereum.


In their analysis, Santiment analysts announced that whale activity in Optimism (OP) and Chiliz (CHZ) altcoins has increased significantly.
According to analysts, this sudden increase in the onchain activities of these two altcoins may be a harbinger of great volatility and reversal in the two altcoins.





Following today's developments, the Bitcoin price managed to exceed the $ 70,000 limit after a long time.

However, although the approval news was for Ethereum, there were also altcoins that rose more than ETH. Ethereum layer-2 protocol Lido Dao, decentralized exchange Uniswap, and PEPE, an Ethereum-based memecoin, showed double-digit increases.


On the other hand, despite the huge rise in the market, GALA and XMR stood out as declining altcoins.

Dogecoin And Shiba Inu Fear & Greed Index Drops To Neutral, Time To Buy? | Bitcoinist.com


								Shiba Inu and Dogecoin continue to remain top choices for investors leading into the bull market. But the crashes from recent weeks have rocked not just their prices, but the market sentiment among them. As the sentiment for both of these meme coins fall, it could mean that it is time to get back into them.
Dogecoin And Shiba Inu Drop To Neutral
The Fear & Greed Index is a scale that helps to tell how crypto investors are looking at a particular asset at a given time. The higher the scale is, the more investors are willing to invest in the assets. While the reverse is the case when the scale falls.

This scale measures sentiment across five categories, including Extreme Fear, Fear, Neutral, Greed, and Extreme Greed, and these are represented by numbers. 1-25 is Extreme Fear, 26 to 46 is Fear, 47 to 53 is Neutral, 54 to 75 is Greed, and 76-100 is Extreme Greed.
Now, since the crypto market saw a recovery since the start of 2024, coins like Shiba Inu and Dogecoin saw their market sentiment rise into the greed territory, even as high as Extreme Greed. However, now, as prices begin to correct back downward, sentiment has fallen as well, sending them toward the fear territory. Currently, both indexes for Dogecoin and Shiba Inu are sitting in neutral.
Data from the CFGI website puts the Shiba Inu sentiment at a value of 51, which is neutral. At the same time, Dogecoin sits at a score of 52, which is neutral as well. At this time, this means that investors are not making any moves and are instead waiting to see where the prices go before throwing their hats in the ring.
Is It Time To Buy?
Historically, the best time to buy is when investors are wary of the market. This often means that prices are hitting their bottom, making them the ideal entry point. However, this has usually been in times of extreme fear and not neutral sentiment.
For example, both Dogecoin and Shiba Inu are still seeing some bullish metrics. One of these is the daily trading volume of these assets. Dogecoin’s trading volume is up 15.51% in the last day to $845.7 million. While the Shiba Inu trading volume is up 22.86% in the same time period to reach $389 million.

This suggests that despite sentiment rolling toward neutral, there is still a lot of interest in both of these meme coins. Therefore, it is not the ideal time to go all in. But rather, smaller positions and dollar cost averaging (DCA) are a better route.
However, with the bull market expected to continue and outpace the previous bull markets, it is expected that current prices will seem like a bargain once the cryptocurrency market does begin to move.

Crypto Whales Amassed Nearly $16.8 Billion Worth of Bitcoin After Spot ETF Launch | Cryptoglobe


                                
Institutional investors have entered the cryptocurrency space with force, with data suggesting that deep-pocketed investors gained interest in the space after the launch of spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) in the United States, leading to whales accumulating over $16 billion in BTC since.



According to data shared by cryptocurrency analytics firm IntoTheBlock, the long-awaited arrival of institutional adoption in the crypto space appears to be underway as cryptocurrency whales — defined by wallet addresses with 1,000 or more BTC in them — have amassed nearly $16.8 billion worth of Bitcoin since spot Bitcoin ETFs were greenlit earlier this year.



In total, according to the firm, these whales added 250,000 BTC since the launch of the spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds, with the aggregate amount Bitcoin whales are holding now being back “near the levels it was prior to the FTX collapse.”



However, IntoTheBlock points out a key shift in the composition of these whales. Traditional finance firms appear to be taking the place previously occupied by crypto-native asset managers.



As reported, Bitcoin selling pressure on the popular cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase has eased as the well-known Coinbase premium, which tracks the price difference of Bitcoin on Coinbase and other exchanges, has significantly narrowed.



The “Coinbase Premium Gap,” as on-chain analysis firm CryptoQuant shows, has narrowed after dipping into significantly negative territory this week, suggesting significant selling pressure on the exchange that is known to be used by institutional investors entering the cryptocurrency space.







            
            

            
            

            
            

        

The narrowing of the gap indicates that selling pressure has eased, likely as flows to spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) started stabilizing and as the price of the flagship cryptocurrency started surging.



Recent filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission have been revealing hedge funds and Wall Street giants added exposure to Bitcoin via spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds in the first quarter of the year, with Bracebridge Capital, a Boston-based hedge fund managing roughly $12 billion in assets, buying up $360 million over three funds.



The disclosure comes amid several others, with the U.S. state of Wisconsin recently becoming the first local government entity to reveal an investment in Bitcoin after purchasing 94,562 shares of BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT), worth nearly $100 million, in the first quarter of the year.



The move sees the state of Wisconsin join several Wall Street giants, including JPMorgan Chase and Wells Fargo, in revealing BTC exposure through investment in spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds, according to 13F filings.



JPMorgan revealed an investment of $731,246 in BlackRock’s IBIT ETF, Bitwise’s BITB, Fidelity’s FBTC, and Grayscale’s GBTC, while Wells Fargo disclosed $141,817 in GBTC holdings. BNP Paribas and BNY Mellon have also made similar disclosures.



BNP Paribas, the second-largest bank in Europe whose asset management arm has over $600 billion in assets under management, has gained exposure to the flagship cryptocurrency Bitcoin in the first quarter of the year as well by purchasing shares of IBIT.

Microsoft Debuts AI PCs That Will ‘Recall‘ Everything You Do - Decrypt

Following last week’s updates from OpenAI and Google, it was Microsoft’s turn to show off its AI prowess during its annual developer conference on Monday, headlined by its new CoPilot+ laptops and Surface Pro tablets built around generative AI.Microsoft said the new Copilot-enabled computers will remember and later be able to find anything displayed on screen—including emails, websites, and applications—with a new Recall feature that stores local snapshots of everything the user does. Copilot+ PCs can also generate and refine AI images on-device using Cocreator, and translate over forty languages with Live Captions.The new Copilot+ PCs also promise extended “all-day” battery life even though they are capable of 40+ trillion operations per second (TOPS).“With Recall, you can access virtually what you have seen or done on your PC in a way that feels like having photographic memory,” Microsoft said. “This helps you remember things you may have forgotten so you can find what you’re looking for quickly and intuitively by simply using the cues you remember.”The prospect of Windows constantly recording everything users see and do, making it possible to find even snippets of text that appeared on screen quickly, sparked both praise and concern. Many tech pundits praised it as a “cool” feature.Others saw it as a dangerous precedent.Commentators compared Microsoft's new Recall feature to Rewind—now Limitless AI—which developed a similar AI tool that used persistent screen recordings to make it possible to find past actions quickly.Beginning June 18, Copilot+ PCs will be available from Acer, Asus, Dell, HP, Lenovo, and Samsung.“[The] interesting thing, which is if you sort of take all of what we've been talking about with AI, it all came about because of the abundance of compute, all primarily in the cloud,” Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella told the Wall Street Journal ahead of Monday's announcements. “So that's what created the GPT-4 for example, which essentially changed the world.“Now what happened in the cloud is going to come to the [Microsoft] Edge and the Edge that first needs to be reinvented before we talk about everything else is the PC,” he continued. “That's what I think of as the ‘AI PC’ or the Copilot+ PCs.”As Nadella explained, the new Copilot+ PCs will utilize cloud computing and internal computing, using a new processor called the Neural Processing Unit (NPU).“So if you want to build any AI application, you have to have an accelerator, just like we have in the cloud to be able to run these matrix math multiplications fast in order to drive our AI features,” Nadella said. “And that's what the NPU does.”To make accessing Copilot even easier, Microsoft in January announced that a dedicated hardware AI key would be coming to Windows 11 keyboards.“Every Copilot+ PC comes with your personal powerful AI agent that is just a single tap away on keyboards with the new Copilot key,” Microsoft wrote at the time. “Copilot will now have the full application experience customers have been asking for in a streamlined, simple yet powerful and personal design.”Rumors around Microsoft’s plans to add Copilot to Windows began circulating in December. The official update, code-named “Hudson Valley,” replaces Microsoft’s Cortana virtual assistant, which was discontinued last August.Like Google, and Amazon, Microsoft has invested heavily in generative AI, including over $10 billion investment in ChatGPT creator, OpenAI, according to a report by the New York Times. Leveraging its partnership with OpenAI, Copilot comes with several of the AI developer’s products, including Dall-E 3 for image generation.“Copilot puts the most advanced AI models at your fingertips,” the tech giant said. “In the coming weeks, get access to the latest models, including GPT-4o, from our partners at OpenAI, so you can have voice conversations that feel more natural.”Microsoft did not immediately respond to a request for comment from Decrypt.Edited by Ryan Ozawa.Generally Intelligent NewsletterA weekly AI journey narrated by Gen, a generative AI model.

Ethereum Soars As SEC Reconsiders Spot Ether ETF Approval - Brave New Coin

The price of Ethereum jumped 18% as the SEC reconsiders it’s position on the approval of an Ethereum Spot ETF.
On Monday, new developments suggest that the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) might be rethinking its stance on spot Ether (ETH) exchange-traded funds (ETFs). Bloomberg ETF analysts James Seyffart and Eric Balchunas have indicated a shift in the SEC’s approach, raising the odds of approval from 25% to 75% after “hearing chatter” about the financial regulator’s internal discussions.
Analysts Adjust Predictions
On Monday Seyffart and Balchunas posted on X to update their predictions regarding the SEC’s decision on spot Ether ETFs. “The SEC might be doing a 180 on their expected denial of spot Ether exchange-traded funds this week,” wrote Balchunas. This new perspective is based on various signals, including recent SEC filings, public statements from SEC Chair Gary Gensler, and insider reports suggesting that the commission might be leaning towards approval following political pressure on Democrats to reverse course on crypto.
Seyffart echoed this sentiment, mentioning that the issue had become “increasingly political.” He hinted at a surge of related filings in the coming days if their sources were correct. “Never gonna hear the end of this from the [Ether] people in my replies if this turns out to be true,” Seyffart remarked, highlighting the potential impact on the cryptocurrency community.
Upcoming Deadlines and Broader Implications
The SEC’s decision on VanEck’s spot Ether ETF is due by May 23. This decision is critical as VanEck’s application is the first in a series of pending spot Ether ETFs, including those from ARK 21Shares, Hashdex, Invesco Galaxy, BlackRock, and Fidelity. The SEC has already delayed VanEck’s application as long as allowed under regulatory guidelines, setting the stage for a potentially groundbreaking decision.

Ethereum soared to $3,636 on the news
In an April interview, VanEck CEO Jan van Eck expressed skepticism about the SEC’s approval of his company’s ETF application in May. This skepticism seemed justified when Grayscale withdrew its application for an Ether futures ETF on May 7, followed by CEO Michael Sonnenshein’s resignation announcement on May 20 (Cointelegraph).
Political and Regulatory Dynamics
The evolving political landscape could also influence the SEC’s decision. Recently, U.S. lawmakers in both the House of Representatives and Senate voted to overturn an SEC rule impacting banks dealing with companies holding digital assets. This congressional resolution’s future remains uncertain, pending President Joe Biden’s decision to either veto or sign it into law.
Furthermore, the SEC has requested exchanges to update their 19b-4 filings, suggesting a potential move towards approving these applications. This request has led to speculation that the SEC might be progressing towards an approval decision. However, even if the 19b-4 filings are approved, the ETFs would still need their S-1 applications cleared before trading could commence, a process without a defined timeline.
 
Industry Reactions and Future Prospects
One company in talks with the SEC reported a more optimistic outlook, feeling that the regulatory body was no longer dragging its feet. This optimism is bolstered by the reassessment from Seyffart and Balchunas, who increased their approval odds based on new information and insider sources
The SEC’s investigation into whether Ether qualifies as a security continues to add complexity to the situation. This investigation, launched after Ethereum transitioned from a proof-of-work to a proof-of-stake consensus mechanism, could influence the SEC’s final decision. A recent development from Prometheum, which launched its Ether custody service with plans to offer services for other digital assets considered securities, might also play a role in shaping the SEC’s view.
As the May 23 deadline approaches, the financial and crypto communities are on high alert. The SEC’s decision could significantly impact the market, setting a precedent for future cryptocurrency ETF approvals, taking crypto centre stage for the upcoming election cycle, and shaping the regulatory landscape for digital assets in the United States.

Crypto Market Rallies As SEC Reportedly Moves Forward With Ether ETF Process - Benzinga

The prices of cryptocurrencies surged on Monday evening as new details emerged about the Securities and Exchange Commission advancing the process for the first U.S. exchange-traded funds holding Ethereum ETH/USD.What Happened: On Monday, the SEC’s Trading and Markets Division instructed asset managers to revise their 19b-4 filings, which are typically used to request the SEC’s permission to amend their rulebooks for the listing of a new type of ETF, according to The Wall Street Journal.This move was seen as a positive development by many investors, leading to a surge in crypto prices. The updated filings are anticipated to be live in the near future, WSJ reports.Despite the lack of communication between the SEC staff and potential ETF issuers, the SEC’s decision to instruct asset managers to amend their filings has raised hopes for an Ether ETF approval this week, according to the Journal. This has led to an 18% surge in the price of Ether and a more than 5% increase in the price of Bitcoin BTC/USD.Why It Matters: The potential approval of an Ether ETF is a significant development for the cryptocurrency market. Ether is the second-largest cryptocurrency after Bitcoin, and an ETF would make it easier for investors to gain exposure to this digital asset.What’s Next: The updated 19b-4 filings are expected to go live in the coming days, WSJ reports. Some analysts have raised their estimates for an ether ETF approval to 75% following this development.See Also: Coinbase Says Ethereum ETF Approval More Likely Than You Think— Here’s WhyWhy It Matters: The SEC’s recent actions have sparked hope for the approval of Ether ETFs, with analysts Eric Balchunas and James Seyffart raising the odds from 25% to 75% on Monday. However, they later clarified that the odds were related to the 19b-4 approvals, not the final ETF authorization.The SEC is expected to make a decision on the VanEck spot Ether ETF on Thursday. The SEC has been investigating whether Ether, the primary native asset to the Ethereum blockchain, is a security. If deemed a security, this could be grounds for the regulator to reject the spot Ether ETF applications.What’s Next: The potential approval of Ether ETFs has already had a significant impact on the market. Following the news, Bitcoin surged past $70,000 and Ethereum’s price rose by 14%.Ethereum’s co-founder, Vitalik Buterin, recently praised the platform’s culture of welcoming criticism, a sentiment that was met with mixed reactions on social media.Read Next: Top Crypto Trader Dumps Entire Bitcoin Portfolio To Buy Altcoins, But Should You Be Taking This ‘Huge’ RiskThis content was partially produced with the help of AI tools and was reviewed and published by Benzinga editors.Photo: Shutterstock.

BlackRock Exec Predicts Tidal Wave of Institutional Money Flooding Into Bitcoin ETFs ⋆ ZyCrypto

&nbsp

&nbsp
Robert Mitchnick, head of digital assets at BlackRock, anticipates a new wave of investment into bitcoin ETFs, particularly from large financial entities such as sovereign wealth funds, pension funds, and endowment funds.



Mitchnick’s prediction comes despite a recent pause following consistent inflows into spot bitcoin ETFs for 71 days. Regardless, the BlackRock exec suggested, “The current lull is likely to be followed by a new wave from a different type of investor.”



In an interview, Mitchnick shared insights on the renewed dialogue around Bitcoin, saying, “Many of these interested firms – whether we’re talking about pensions, endowments, sovereign wealth funds, insurers, other asset managers, family offices – are having ongoing diligence and research conversations, and we’re playing a role from an education perspective.”



BlackRock’s Strategic Expansion into Digital Assets: Spotlight on Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs



Since their approval earlier this year, spot bitcoin ETFs have seen significant interest, with over $76 billion accrued across these products. BlackRock’s bitcoin ETF, IBIT, has notably amassed $17.2 billion in assets. This compares to Grayscale’s Bitcoin Trust, now an ETF holding approximately $24.3 billion.



The increase in IBIT’s assets is partly due to transfers from Grayscale’s product, shifts from higher-priced ETFs in Canada and Europe, and conversions from bitcoin futures ETFs.

&nbsp



Nonetheless, Mitchnick emphasized that BlackRock is not solely focused on becoming the leading provider of spot bitcoin ETFs but prioritizes client education and comprehensive asset management. Moreover, the firm is expanding its digital asset initiatives, demonstrated by its recent application for an Ethereum ETF.



This move follows CEO Larry Fink’s hyping of the transformative potential of tokenization, which represents “traditional assets on blockchains.”



However, market experts argue that BlackRock’s potential introduction of an ether exchange-traded fund (ETF) prompts the need to educate clients about the Ethereum blockchain. Likewise, investors may question the need for another crypto ETF after adjusting their portfolio’s risk return through spot Bitcoin ETF’s Sharpe ratio.



Mitchnick emphasized that BlackRock views digital assets from three critical perspectives. These components are considered interconnected, each informing the firm’s strategies and insights into others. “When we think about this space, we see the potential for digital assets to benefit our clients and capital markets, with a focus in three areas: crypto assets, stablecoins, and tokenization. And these pillars, they’re all interrelated.” Mitchnick expressed.



This holistic approach aims to equip clients with a nuanced understanding of effectively incorporating digital assets into their investment portfolios.

Ethereum Soars 20%, Lifting Arbitrum and Optimism - Decrypt

We do the research, you get the alpha!Get exclusive reports and access to key insights on airdrops, NFTs, and more! Subscribe now to Alpha Reports and up your game!Go to Alpha ReportsRumors of a potential approval of Ethereum spot ETFs have fueled a full day of gains for the Ethereum ecosystem, with the price of ETH skyrocketing 20% intraday to just shy of $3,700—trading at $3,687 at time of writing—and sister tokens Arbitrum (ARB) and Optimism (OP) both notching gains of 18% on Monday.The optimistic mood had already spread to other cryptocurrencies, including Solana (SOL) and Avalanche (AVAX), which are peaking above $40 and $188 respectively, as of this writing, representing more than 25% gains over the last seven days for both.The sudden rally to start the week was sparked moments after two Bloomberg ETF analysts—Eric Balchunas and James Seyffart—revealed their joint prediction that the Securities and Exchange Commission “could be doing a 180 on this increasingly political issue” and approve Ethereum spot ETFs when its first major deadline comes later this week.They increased their estimated odds of approval to 75%—a huge upgrade from their prior estimate of 25%, which was already more pessimistic than other analysts who placed the chances at 50-50 earlier this year.Crypto oddsmakers are certainly shifting their views, with the collective probability of an Ethereum spot ETF approval by the end of the month leaping from 10% yesterday to 61% on Polymarket, as of this writing. Optimism had been declining steadily since the betting option appeared in January at 76%, when Bitcoin spot ETFs were unleashed.As with the long and meandering Bitcoin spot ETF approval process, the SEC has systematically delayed making a decision on the Ethereum equivalents. Hopes for approval had dimmed, with fears peaking that this week's deadline would prompt the federal regulator to outright declare Ethereum a security, decisively separating it from the commodity status enjoyed by Bitcoin.Late last week, however, a debate on Capitol Hill prompted many Democrats to join Republicans in defiance of Pres. Joe Biden's pro-SEC stance, a significant battle in a broadly partisan war over U.S. crypto policy.Meanwhile, leading cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase said it saw Ethereum spot ETFs as an eventuality—if not immediately approved on May 23.All of this came as top coin Bitcoin was in the middle of its own rally, the price of BTC clearing $70,000 earlier in the day amid massive short-position liquidiations—heights not seen since April 12, and approaching the $73,737 all-time high set in March.The good mood was contagious, and by late Monday, the top 25 cryptocurrencies by market cap were all green for the day—and for the prior 7 days.Among meme coins, Bonk and Pepe are both up more than 20% in the last 24 hours.Daily Debrief NewsletterStart every day with the top news stories right now, plus original features, a podcast, videos and more.

Shiba Inu (SHIB) Delivers Devastating Performance, Solana (SOL) Performs Massive Breakthrough, Is Ethereum (ETH) Ready For Bullish Market?

Shiba Inu's inability to break through the 50 EMA is a problematic situation for the asset as it limits the potential SHIB had in the current market recovery phase. Unfortunately, the lack of trading volume and inflows suggests we are not going to see any changes in the foreseeable future whatsoever.Analyzing the chart, Shiba Inu has been struggling to maintain upward momentum. The 50 EMA, which acts as a significant resistance level, has proven to be a formidable barrier. SHIB's repeated failures to surpass this level indicate a weak buying pressure, which is crucial for any sustained rally.SHIB/USDT Chart by TradingViewAdditionally, the Bollinger Bands show that SHIB is trading within a narrow range, reflecting low volatility. This lack of movement is further compounded by the low trading volumes, as seen in the volume bars. The MACD histogram is also in the red, indicating bearish momentum.One of the critical issues for Shiba Inu is the absence of significant inflows. The market appears to be lacking confidence in SHIB, which is crucial for driving up the price. Without new capital entering the market, the asset is unlikely to see any substantial gains. Solana gains strengthSolana has finally broken through the local resistance level at $172, signaling a potential upcoming surge for the cryptocurrency. Fortunately, the current market conditions appear favorable for a sustained reversal. This breakthrough could set the stage for further bullish momentum in the coming days.The chart shows that Solana has been steadily climbing, with strong support from the 50 EMA and the 200 EMA, which are acting as significant support levels. The recent price action indicates a strong bullish trend, with SOL gaining momentum as it broke through the $172 resistance level. This move is critical as it opens the door for Solana to aim for higher targets, possibly reaching $200 in the near future.The volume profile also supports this bullish outlook, with increasing buying volume accompanying the price surge. This indicates strong demand for SOL, which is essential for maintaining the upward trajectory. The RSI is currently in the neutral zone, suggesting that there is still room for further price appreciation before entering overbought territory.Bitcoin and Ethereum are also showing strength. This overall bullish sentiment can provide additional tailwinds for Solana, helping it sustain its upward movement. Potential targets for SOL are $190 and $200.Ethereum needs another pushEthereum didn't deliver the performance the majority expected from it, but in reality, it's really close to entering a substantial bullish trend if the 50 EMA gets finally broken. Obviously, some serious inflow of buying power is needed for that.Analyzing the chart, Ethereum has been struggling to maintain upward momentum for several weeks. The 50 EMA has acted as a significant resistance level, preventing ETH from achieving a more substantial bullish trend. The current price level is hovering around $3,100, which is crucial for Ethereum to break through to signal a strong bullish move.The Bollinger Bands indicate that Ethereum is trading within a relatively narrow range, reflecting low volatility. However, the recent green candles suggest that there is some buying interest, though not yet enough to push ETH past the 50 EMA. For Ethereum to enter a bull market, a significant increase in trading volume is necessary.The RSI remains in the neutral zone, suggesting that there is still room for buying pressure without the asset becoming overbought. The MACD (Moving Average Convergence Divergence) histogram shows a slight bullish divergence, which could indicate a potential upward move if the buying interest continues.Ethereum's performance has lagged behind expectations, especially compared to Bitcoin. The lack of significant inflows and investor confidence has kept ETH from reaching its full potential during the recent market recovery phase. However, the technical indicators suggest that Ethereum is on the verge of a breakout.

Can Solana's speed propel SOL prices to a new high - AMBCrypto



Solana’s high TPS might have attracted more users as its active addresses increased. 
SOL’s price action remained bullish as it increased by 20% last week.

Solana [SOL] has created quite some buzz in the crypto space, not just for its price but also for its network stats. In fact, the blockchain has outperformed other top players like Polygon [MATIC] on a key front. 
Solana tops the table
The latest data from CoinGecko revealed that Solana ranked number one on the list of blockchains by transactions per second (TPS). 
This achievement showed the efficiency and dependability of the blockchain as it processed the maximum number of transactions in a set timeframe. 
Apart from SOL, Sui, Binance Smart Chain, and Polygon also made it to the top four on the same list. However, it was interesting to note that while Polygon’s TPS stood at 190, Solana had a major lead as its TPS was 1053. Ethereum was lower down on the list with a TPS of just 22.
AMBCryto’s look at Solana Explorer revealed that, at press time, SOL’s TPS was 2303.
Source: Solana Explorer
AMBCrypto then checked Artemis’ data to see whether Solana’s high TPS had any impact on its network activity. We found that SOL’s daily active addresses have increased over the past three months. The number spiked in mid-March as it exceeded 2.4 million. 
However, despite an increase in daily active addresses, the blockchain’s daily transaction count remained somewhat similar to that at the beginning of February. 
Notably, SOL’s daily transactions did witness a major uptick on the 11th of April, but the trend didn’t last.
Source: Artemis
Things in terms of captured value also didn’t look good for the blockchain. SOL’s fees registered a massive drop after spiking on the 18th of March. 
Thanks to the drop in fees, the blockchain’s revenue also followed a similar declining trend over the last several weeks. Nonetheless, SOL’s performance on the DeFi front remained on par as its TVL continued to grow. 
Solana investors are rejoicing 
In the meantime, SOL’s price action gained bullish momentum. According to CoinMaerketCap, SOL was up by more than 20% in the last seven days. 
At press time, it was trading at $178.08 with a market capitalization of over $79.9 billion. Surprisingly, the price uptick didn’t help stir up bullish sentiment in the market, as its weighted sentiment remained in the negative zone.

Bearish sentiment around SOL might not be enough to stop the bulls. AMBCrypto’s analysis of SOL’s daily chart revealed that its Relative Strength Index (RSI) registered a massive uptick. 
Its Chaikin Money Flow (CMF) also looked bullish, as it had a value of 0.15 at press time. The concerning indicator was the Money Flow Index (MFI), as it indicated that SOL’s price might witness a correction.

Bitcoin Exchange Balances Hit Rock Bottom: Are We On The Verge of A Major Bull Run?


								Amid anticipating the major post-Havling rally, Bitcoin (BTC) exchange reserves have hit an unprecedented low, falling below $2 million. This trend is particularly noteworthy as it signals an impending price for BTC.
Thomas Fahrer, co-founder of Apollo, echoed this in his recent post on the social media platform X, noting that the dwindling BTC exchange reserves could be the harbinger of a significant uptick in price, particularly with the anticipated influx of ETF flows.

Bitcoin Outlook: A Bullish Signal
In his post on X, Fahrer emphasized that Bitcoin’s current low levels on exchanges could spark a parabolic price surge, driven by a potent mix of “Demand shock + Inelastic supply.”

His comments reflect a growing optimism among investors who view the plunging exchange supply as an indicator of an upcoming bullish market phase. This trend, particularly, suggests that numerous investors are transferring their BTC off exchanges, likely opting to hold them long-term in anticipation of rising prices.
Furthermore, the evolving dynamics in BTC’s exchange supply are part of a larger pattern that includes substantial institutional interest, fueling speculation about a forthcoming second wave of ETF inflows.
Such inflows are expected to diminish the available supply of BTC further, exacerbating the supply squeeze and potentially driving prices upward.
Institutional players, including hedge funds and public pensions, are increasingly accumulating through ETFs. This trend marks a significant shift in how traditional financial entities perceive these assets.
For instance, Thomas Fahrer points out that Horizon Kinetic Asset Management has made a significant commitment to BTC. The firm has invested $913 million in IBIT and GBTC, representing approximately 14% of its total $6.5 billion in assets under management.

This massive allocation highlights the growing confidence that major institutions have in the future of BTC.
Retail vs. Institutional: A Divided Market
While institutional investors pile into BTC ETFs, retail investors seem more cautious. Bitcoinist recently cited IntotheBlock’s report revealing a bifurcated market where hedge funds and pension funds actively increase their BTC holdings through ETFs. In contrast, the average investor remains on the sidelines.
This division is highlighted by the recent activities of whales (large investors) who have added 250,000 Bitcoins to their holdings, returning their total to levels seen before the FTX collapse in 2023.
Hedge funds, expected to be major players in institutional adoption, have not disappointed. Firms like Millennium Management have invested billions in BTC ETFs, showcasing their belief in the cryptocurrency’s potential.

Public pensions are also entering the fray, with the state of Wisconsin investing $160 million in Bitcoin ETFs. This move highlights the growing acceptance of BitBTCcoin in traditional investment portfolios.
Moreover, Morgan Stanley’s recent filings reveal significant investments in the Bitcoin ETF market. The bank has purchased 31,712 shares of Ark’s 21Shares ETF (ARKB) and allocated $269 million to the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC).

These investments have made Morgan Stanley the third-largest holder of GBTC shares and a top 20 investor in Ark’s ETF, indicating strong institutional interest in BTC.

Trader Predicts More Rallies for Surging Ethereum Rival, Updates Outlook on Chainlink and Two Additional Altcoins - The Daily Hodl


								A closely followed crypto strategist says he’s bullish on one Ethereum (ETH) competitor that surged by as much as 43% last week.
Pseudonymous trader Altcoin Sherpa tells his 216,300 followers on the social media platform X that Fantom (FTM) will see more rallies in the coming months.










“FTM is going to $1-ish before any pullback and should go even higher in the next six months, in my opinion. Interesting upgrades/pivots coming here, and I have a bag. This looks strong in the short term.”

At time of writing, FTM is worth $0.856.
Looking at the native asset of the decentralized oracle network Chainlink (LINK), the trader says the altcoin is in a position to ignite a breakout rally.
“LINK goes to $20 if it can break past this $16 mark, in my opinion.
Still wouldn’t personally buy here though.”

At time of writing, LINK is trading at $16.53.
Next is the memecoin dogwifhat (WIF), which the analyst says is approaching a potential bounce level.
“WIF: $2.30 should provide a bounce area. Thought it would break past the range high but definitely was wrong. Could also see the wick tapped again, too, around $1.80. Those should be good short-term bounces overall.”
Source: Altcoin Sherpa/X
At time of writing, WIF is worth $2.54.
The last altcoin on the trader’s radar is the native asset of the Solana (SOL)-based decentralized exchange (DEX) aggregator Jupiter (JUP). According to Altcoin Sherpa, JUP is currently in the process of carving a bottom.
“Some of these charts look pretty good overall. JUP for example. expecting some sort of slow grind up after forming some sort of short-term bottom.”

                        South Korean analysts think new challenges await the “next generation” of stablecoins, as the industry continues to develop.The use of algorithms in stablecoin development, they say, will present new “risks” for token holders. And experts are still unconvinced by their algorithmic designs.The claims came in a report from researchers at the South Korean Bithumb crypto exchange, according to the media outlet Kyunghyang Games.
Stablecoin Market: Four Generations of Coins
The media outlet noted that stablecoins were currently used mainly to “purchase assets on exchanges.”The exchange said that some people also used these coins in the “remittance and payments spaces.”Bithumb identified “four generations” of stablecoins, beginning with “first-generation” coins like USDT.The top three stablecoins by market capitalization. (Source: CoinMarketCap)Such coins use fiat currencies such as the US dollar as reserves. Their issuers claim to hold assets matching the value of the number of coins in circulation.The exchange noted that USDT’s issuer was “initially criticized” for its “lack of transparency” on the status of its reserve holdings.Bithumb remarked that these concerns had largely been “resolved” by the fact that the issuer now published quarterly reports detailing asset holdings, including US Treasury bonds and Bitcoin.Second-generation coins, such as DAI, use crypto as a “source of reserve value,” Bithumb said.This helps such coins maintain their “decentralized value” and keep in “the basic spirit of the blockchain world.”However, these tokens also experienced the “disadvantage of greater value volatility,” with cryptoassets often experiencing sudden price fluctuations. Bithumb wrote:
“To address the shortcomings of second-generation stablecoin projects, [communities] have added US Treasury bonds and real-world assets (RWA) to their collateral reserves.”Stablecoins total market capitalization. (Source: DeFiLlama)Limitations – and Opportunities
The report’s authors noted that “in the case of second-generation stablecoins,” project teams have tended to “proceed with care” when issuing coins.This is “because the proportion of cryptoassets in their reserves” is large, the authors wrote.However, while this conservative approach has helped many such coins “protect value,” they have experienced “scalability” issues, the authors said.
Third-gen Problems and Advantages
The report then went on to discuss what it called “third-generation” stablecoins, which make use of algorithmic features.The authors noted that algorithmic stablecoins use neither fiat nor crypto as collateral. Instead, their issuers “control the supply and demand of coins using an algorithm that maintains the asset price stability.”As such, when market forces push the stablecoin’s value above $1, the algorithm triggers the release of more tokens into the ecosystem.Conversely, the algorithm can cause the network to burn tokens from designated pools if the value drops.Here, the authors noted, scalability “was maximized in favorable market conditions.”But if the inverse were true, “it was found that it could not maintain a fixed value only by controlling the circulation volume and arbitrage algorithm, without the use of collateral.”As such, developers have begun to issue what the exchange called “fourth-generation stablecoins.”These, the authors said, were created to address the risk of third-generation stablecoins “de-pegging” from their fixed value.While they also use algorithms to control supply, these algorithmic features are “improved” in 4th-gen coins such as Ethena (USDe).Experts Still Not Sure About Gen Four
Bithumb said that while many experts think these 4th-generation coins are still “risky,” they are expanding their market share and “attracting market attention to emerging assets.”The exchange noted that “since the emergence of 4th-generation stablecoins, USDT’s market share “has decreased from 80% to 70%.” The authors concluded:
“Many experts emphasize the risks of 4th-generation stablecoins, as they use algorithmic systems. Overcoming the perception of these experts will be a challenge for this new class of stablecoins.”

Solana-based Zack Morris crypto [ZACK] explodes 200%, but should you be wary? - AMBCrypto



Twitter user Zack Morris launched a new coin that surged by more than 100% in the last 24 hours.
Activity and volume on the Solana network also grew.

Solana [SOL] has been the hotspot for launching new meme coins for the longest time.
To cash in on the hype, Edward Constantinescu, who is known as Zack Morris on X (formerly Twitter), and the co-founder of Atlas Trading, recently launched a meme coin on the network, titled ZACK.
ZACK sees new heights
At press time, ZACK was trading at $0.04168 and its price had grown by 216.00% in the last 24 hours. But even though the token’s price had surged significantly, traders should be aware of Edward Constantinescu’s past.
Source: CoinMarketCap
Zack Morris crypto: Once bitten, twice shy
The sequence of events began on the 14th of December 2022, when the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) initiated legal action against Atlas Trading and Edward Constantinescu.
They were accused of defrauding investors to the tune of $100 million.
According to the SEC’s lawsuit against Atlas Trading, the two purportedly orchestrated a scheme involving the coordinated acquisition of shares, its promotion, and subsequent sale for significant profits.
During the COVID-19 pandemic and the GameStop meme stock frenzy from March 2020 to April 2021, Atlas Trading emerged as a prominent presence on Discord for traders.
Some argue that they played a pivotal role in the rise of the FinTwit phenomenon.
Edward Constantinescu became ubiquitous on X, promoting various penny stocks with his distinctive meme face, seemingly representing Atlas Trading.
The alleged modus operandi of the Atlas Trading scheme unfolded as follows.
Edward Constantinescu would acquire substantial stakes in a penny stock, then tout its potential meteoric rise on X.
Concurrently, anonymous users would hype up the stock on social media, declaring it was destined for great highs. Allegedly, these users also held positions in the company before the surge.
Once the stock was purportedly inflated, they allegedly offloaded their shares before their followers, reaping substantial profits in the process.
Due to these factors, the memecoin ZACK has met with some skepticism as well.
How will Solana be affected?
Despite the uncertainty of the usefulness of the Zack Morris crypto token, Solana continued to reap benefits.

The surge in deployment of meme coins on Solana has had a positive impact on the network, as activity and number of transactions on the network have surged.
However, if too many rugpulls occur, the sentiment around the network can be affected negatively.

Is $68,500 Bitcoin Recovery A Deadcat Bounce? What Data Says


								Here’s what futures market data could suggest about whether this latest Bitcoin recovery will be a dead-cat bounce or not.
Bitcoin Futures Market Shows No Signs Of Overheating So Far
As explained by an analyst in a CryptoQuant Quicktake post, the BTC funding rate has stabilized around a relatively low value recently. The “funding rate” here refers to an indicator that tracks the amount of periodic fees that derivatives market traders are paying each other right now.
When this metric’s value is positive, it means that the long contract holders are paying a premium to the short investors to hold onto their positions. Such a trend implies that the majority of the market shares a bullish sentiment.

On the other hand, a negative value of the indicator implies that short investors are the dominant force in the sector, and thus, the average derivatives user is bearish on the coin.
Now, here is a chart that shows the data for the Bitcoin funding rate, as well as its 7-day simple moving average (SMA), over the past year or so:

The value of the metric appears to have been positive in recent months | Source: CryptoQuant
From the above graph, it’s clear that the Bitcoin funding rate has been mostly at positive levels for a while now. This makes sense, as the asset has rallied over the last few months, so investors as a whole would be bullish about it.
Historically, though, a highly positive funding rate has been a bearish sign for the cryptocurrency’s price. This is because the asset tends to perform in the direction opposite to the majority’s expectation, and the likelihood of a contrary move rises as this expectation becomes stronger.
At high values of the indicator, there is an overwhelming bullish sentiment, so tops for the coin can become more probable. As is apparent in the chart, the Bitcoin all-time high (ATH) back in March was also set alongside a large spike in the metric.
The sentiment had initially remained at significant bullish levels in the consolidation period that followed this top, but recently, the metric has observed a cooldown.
The Bitcoin funding rates are still positive, but their scale is much smaller now. More specifically, the 7-day MA of the indicator is currently floating at just 0.45%, which is notably lesser than the 3% to 4% values seen in March.

So far, the metric hasn’t spiked alongside the cryptocurrency’s recovery beyond the $68,000 level, potentially suggesting that the sentiment hasn’t overheated yet. As the quant notes:
In previous “dead-cat-bounce” scenarios, funding rates were higher, with March 2021 seeing a rate close to 3% before a correction to $30,000, and November 2021 rates between 0.7% and 0.8% before the 2022 bear market.
BTC Price
At the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading around the $68,500 mark, up almost 9% over the past week.

Litecoin Whales Go On $230 Million Buying Spree: Will This Change LTC's Stars?


																On-chain data shows the Litecoin whales have gone on a $230 million buying spree recently, which could bring bullish winds for the coin.
Litecoin Whales Have Been Making Net Inflows To Their Wallets Recently
According to data from the market intelligence platform IntoTheBlock, the Litecoin whales have received large net inflows in their addresses over the past month or so.
The on-chain indicator relevant here is the “Large Holders Netflow,” which tracks the net amount of Bitcoin entering into or moving out of the combined wallets of investors owning at least 1% of the cryptocurrency’s circulating supply.

	Related Reading



IntoTheBlock defines such “large holders” as the whale entities of the asset. Whales are generally considered to be influential beings on the network, owing to their ability to move large amounts on the network in a short span of time.
When the Large Holders Netflow has a positive value, it means that these humongous investors are receiving a net amount of coins into their balance right now. Naturally, such buying can be bullish for the coin’s price.
On the other hand, the negative indicator implies the whales are potentially participating in selling currently, which could have bearish consequences for the asset.
Now, here is a chart that shows the trend in the Litecoin Large Holders Netflow over the past month:

The value of the metric seems to have been positive in recent days | Source: IntoTheBlock on X
As displayed in the above graph, the Litecoin Large Holders Netflow has mostly observed positive values inside this window, suggesting that the whales’ wallets have been receiving net deposits.
According to the analytics firm, these large holders have accumulated 2,751,633 LTC in the last 30 days. At the current exchange rate of the asset, this stack is worth a whopping $230 million.
As the chart also shows, the indicator spiked particularly strongly on the 10th of this month. During these net inflows alone, the whales bought 900,000 LTC, the highest daily amount since February, representing around one-third of the total accumulation in the past month.

	Related Reading



This buying spree from the large holders has come as the asset’s price has been consolidating around its lows following the mid-April crash. Thus, it would imply the whales believe the recent prices of Litecoin to have been worthy entry points into the coin.
This could certainly be a bullish sign for the cryptocurrency, so it remains to be seen how the asset’s price will develop in the near future. The indicator may be worth monitoring, though, as its value turning negative could instead spell a bearish outcome for the coin.
LTC Price
Litecoin has continued to consolidate inside its range recently as its price is currently trading around $84.

'We Messed Up': Gala Games Confirms $240 Million Worth of Tokens Swiped via Exploit - Decrypt

We do the research, you get the alpha!Get exclusive reports and access to key insights on airdrops, NFTs, and more! Subscribe now to Alpha Reports and up your game!Go to Alpha ReportsThe price of the Gala Games (GALA) token plunged on Monday after an attacker minted and made off with 5 billion tokens via the Gala smart contract, with the swiped tokens worth around $240 million at the time of the exploit.Ultimately, the attacker managed to sell 600 million of the tokens via decentralized exchange Uniswap, or about $29 million worth at the time of the exploit. The price dropped 20% in less than an hour amid the selling, plunging from about $0.048 to $0.038.“A compromised or rogue Gala Games admin address minted 5 Billion $GALA ($200M) and has been systematically selling the tokens for the past 2 hours,” pseudonymous smart contract developer and security auditor 0xQuit wrote on Twitter.Nearly two hours after the hack was spotted, Gala CEO Eric “Benefactor” Schiermeyer posted an update to the Gala Discord server confirming the exploit and explaining the situation.“We identified the compromise and within 45 minutes we secured and removed unauthorized access to the GALA contract,” Schiermeyer wrote. “It's important to note our ETH contract for $GALA is secure and under the protection of a multi-sig wallet. It was never compromised.”The same message was posted to the Gala Games Twitter account. Later, Gala said that the wallet in question had been "frozen." As a result, the remaining 4.4 billion tokens that weren't sold are described in the initial post as being "effectively burned," meaning they can't be transferred or accessed and thus are considered destroyed. The total supply of GALA encompasses 50 billion tokens."We messed up our internal controls... this shouldn't have happened and we are taking steps to ensure it doesn't ever again," Schiermeyer added. "We believe we have identified the culprit and we are currently working with the FBI, DOJ, and a network of international authorities."In a follow-up tweet, Gala Games described the attack as an "isolated incident." Gala did not immediately respond to Decrypt’s request for comment.GALA has rebounded to a price of about $0.04272 as of this writing, putting the token's price essentially flat over the past 24 hours. That's due in part to a market-wide surge that has seen Ethereum itself surge by 20% over the past day, with the residual effects of the market swing apparently offsetting the impact of the sales.In 2023, Schiermeyer sued fellow Gala co-founder Wright Thurston, alleging that the latter stole $130 million in GALA tokens.According to the lawsuit, GALA tokens were moved from a company wallet and spread across 43 wallets under Thurston’s control before being sold between September 2022 and May 2023.In a countersuit, Thurston alleges Schiermeyer neglected to seek his input while making transactions that led to the “sell off and waste [of] millions of dollars in company assets.”Edited by Andrew HaywardGG NewsletterGet the latest web3 gaming news, hear directly from gaming studios and influencers covering the space, and receive power-ups from our partners.

Crypto Investment Fund Exec Sentenced To 3 Years For Scheme


								Lilian Nurieva, former Head of Networks at Russian crypto Investment fund Finiko, has been sentenced to three years for defrauding private investors and participating in an organized criminal group.
The $55 million pyramidal scheme is considered the second-largest financial scam in Russia’s post-Soviet history by the Federal Foundation for the Protection of Investors and Shareholders Rights.

Crypto Investment Fund Turns Ponzi Scheme
In 2021, Russian authorities began investigating the ‘crypto investment fund’ Finiko for fraud and organized crime. According to the investigation, the fund was a Ponzi scheme that took millions in investors’ money.
From 2018 to 2021, Finiko served as a pyramidal scheme presented as a crypto fund to investors. The scam’s main organizer and beneficiary, Kirill Doronin, traveled the country offering master classes, attracting thousands of clients.
Alongside his accomplices, Doronin created a criminal community to systematically embezzle citizens’ money. The criminals would approach potential clients, stating they had developed a “unique automatic profit generation system” that “guaranteed” massive returns in cryptocurrencies, including Bitcoin.
Users would receive their dividends at first and be able to withdraw their money in BTC. However, things started to take a left turn for investors after Finiko’s crypto token started to devalue in 2021. In a month, the firm’s offices abruptly closed, and its website was shut down, leaving investors empty-handed.
Donorin assured investors that the crypto fund was experiencing technical failures, but it was later established that his associates had already fled the country with investors’ money.
According to the investigation, many clients had taken loans or sold their houses to invest in the fraudulent fund. It was revealed that the investment fund functioned as a Ponzi scheme, where old clients received payments from the new investors’ money.
At the time, the Ministry of Internal Affairs of the Russian Federation (MDV) estimated that the firm had scammed over 10,000 individuals and stolen over 5 billion rubles, around $55 million.
First Finiko Executive Sentenced
Lilia Nurieva, one of Finiko’s executives, has been found guilty of defrauding investors by the Vakhitovsky District Court of Kazan. Nurieva, a key participant in the crypto scheme, was given a “mild” sentence for collaborating with the prosecutors.
The former executive was originally sentenced to four and a half years for committing fraud and participating in an organized criminal association. However, Nurieva will only serve three years in prison as her pre-trial detention time will be counted as part of the sentence.
According to local reports, prosecutors requested six and a half years for the Russian executive, but the former Head of Networks was able to reduce her time due to a pre-trial agreement. This deal allowed Nurieva to avoid facing up to ten years in prison.
Moreover, the executive fully admitted to the charges and collaborated with the investigation, facilitating to be tried separately from the other defendants. Her lawyer, Maria Belousova, stated that the prosecutors’ accusations against her client were “fair.” She also noted that Nurieva was the only one among the defendants who had invested her money in the scheme.
Per Belousova, the former Finiko executive invested 40 million rubles in the investment fund before becoming part of the organization:

When she joined the criminal association, there were illusions that it was not criminal and illegal. Then, during communication with top executives, clarity came.

The other ten defendants, including Doronin, have yet to be tried. The Prosecutor General’s office approved their indictment on April 27 and sent it to the Vakhitovsky court. The defendants are also accused of organizing a criminal association and fraud on a large scale committed by an organized group.

Bitcoin eyes return to ATH, but are you holding it back? - AMBCrypto



BTC has stayed above $66,000.
Small BTC wallets have dumped more coins in the past week.

Bitcoin [BTC] is trading above $66,000 and is attempting to climb back to its recent all-time high. Despite this rebound effort, small wallets have been selling off their holdings. 
However, the overall accumulation of BTC has continued, suggesting that larger investors or institutions are still buying despite the sell-offs from smaller wallets.
Small Bitcoin wallets dump holdings
According to new data from Santiment, small Bitcoin wallets have been selling off their holdings in the past few weeks.
 Analysis of the total number of holders showed that over 182,000 holders sold their holdings in the past week.
 The chart indicated that wallets with under 0.1 BTC have reduced their holdings by 0.46% in the past week. This decline might be due to small wallets attempting to make quick profits.
Source: Santiment
However, despite this decline, the pattern of small wallets selling and large wallets accumulating is typically considered a bullish sign. 
Analysis of wallets holding 1,000 or more BTC showed that the volume held by these wallets has increased recently. At the time of this writing, the total number of Bitcoin holders was around 53.8 million.
Bitcoin continues to see negative netflow
Analysis of Bitcoin’s exchange netflow revealed that it recently experienced its highest negative volume. 
On 15th May, the netflow was -22,359 BTC, the highest since December 2023. The chart indicated that netflow has remained negative since then, meaning more BTC is being withdrawn from exchanges than deposited. 
This suggests that despite the sell-off from small BTC wallets, there is significant ongoing accumulation.
Source: CryptoQuant
This trend is typically a bullish signal, indicating confidence among larger holders and reducing the available supply on exchanges. Consequently, the price trend could benefit from this increased accumulation.
BTC struggles to stay above $66,000
A look at Bitcoin on a daily time frame showed that it has recently entered the $66,000 price zone and has been struggling to maintain it. 
According to AMBCrypto’s analysis, Bitcoin was trading at around $66,700, which is an approximate 0.7% increase at the time of this writing.

                        The Russian crypto mining industry could grow “by between 20% and 40%” in 2024, a new report has claimed.Per the media outlet Overclockers, the claims came from industry insiders in a report from BitRiver.The latter is Russia’s biggest crypto mining player. The firm is one of the driving forces behind a recent legislative push that could result in the “legalization” of the sector.
Russian Crypto Mining Industry ‘Continues to Grow’
In the report, analysts claimed that the “low cost of electricity” and “the absence of strict regulation by the authorities” were resulting in “good growth dynamics” for crypto miners.The report’s authors quoted the director of the Industrial Mining Association, Sergei Bezdelov, as stating that the industrial crypto mining market “doubled in size” in 2023.BitRiver claims that last year domestic Bitcoin miners accrued a combined total of about BTC 54,000.The firm said that Russia “continues” to be one of the world’s biggest crypto mining powers.BitRiver also claimed that “over 95%” of Russian miners’ “computing resources” are being used to mine BTC.However, not all experts agree on this statistic. The Co-founder of the Encry Foundation, Roman Nekrasov, said he believed BTC accounted for 90% of Russian mining efforts.He said 10% of Russian miners focus on altcoins like Litecoin (LTC) and Kaspa (KAS).KAS prices over the past seven days. (Source: CoinMarketCap)Market Still Largely Unregulated
At present, mining has no legal status in Russia. However, many in Moscow have proposed banning crypto in various forms.Miners want lawmakers to “hurry up and legalize” their sector, even if that means paying taxes on their earnings.The Energy Ministry has suggested easing the load on overworked grids by forcing miners to turn off their rigs for a fixed amount of time every year.The latest legislative proposals reportedly either suggest restricting private mining or allowing energy providers to fine suspected “home” crypto miners.Low Power Costs Spark More Growth Potential
Legal experts weighed in. They told the report’s authors that legal provisions for crypto and crypto mining already exist in Russia.Elizaveta Vikhlyantseva, a lawyer at the law firm Vegas Lex, noted that there was nothing in Russian law that “prohibited” the construction of “crypto mining farms.”Meanwhile, Yaroslav Shitsla, the head of the IT and IP dispute resolution department at the law firm Rustam Kurmaev and Partners, said that “cryptocurrency has already been recognized as property.”Shitsla pointed to the law “On Digital Financial Assets” as evidence for this claim. And while this may be true, critics have called this law “lacking in substance.”The Financial Action Task Force (FATF) appears to agree. It has downgraded Russia’s compliance rating accordingly.Regardless, experts struck an upbeat note. Nikita Vassev, the founder of Terracrypto, claimed that the rapid growth of mining in Russia was due to the low cost of electricity.Vassev added that Russia’s “climatic conditions” were also favorable for miners.The expert notes that “the majority of miners choose to operate in Siberia because of the opportunity to save on cooling costs.”Experts added that there were “many production sites” in the country that could “easily be repurposed for Bitcoin mining.”Most agreed that the “lack of strict control by local regulators” creates “positive conditions for cryptocurrency-related business.”

XRP Price Rises Within Range: Poised for a Breakout?


																XRP price avoided a major downside break as ETH’s surges. The price is back above $0.5220 and eyeing a key upside break in the near term.

XRP started a decent increase above the $0.5150 resistance zone.
The price is now trading above $0.5250 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average.
There was a break above a key bearish trend line with resistance at $0.520 on the hourly chart of the XRP/USD pair (data source from Kraken).
The pair could correct gains, but the bulls might remain active near the $0.5180 zone.

XRP Price Recovers
After a drop toward the $0.5065 support, XRP price started a recovery wave. Recently, Ethereum rallied over 20% and Bitcoin climbed above $70,000. It sparked decent bullish moves in XRP.
The price climbed above the $0.5150 and $0.520 resistance level. There was a break above a key bearish trend line with resistance at $0.520 on the hourly chart of the XRP/USD pair. The pair even broke the $0.5320 resistance and traded as high as $0.5386.
The price is now correcting gains and might test the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the upward wave from the $0.5064 swing low to the $0.5386 high.
It is now trading above $0.5250 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. Immediate resistance is near the $0.5380 level. The first key resistance is near $0.5420. A close above the $0.5420 resistance zone could send the price higher. The next key resistance is near $0.5550.

If the bulls push the price above the $0.5550 resistance level, there could be a fresh move toward the $0.5650 resistance. Any more gains might send the price toward the $0.5720 resistance.
Another Decline?
If XRP fails to clear the $0.5380 resistance zone, it could start a downside correction. Initial support on the downside is near the $0.5310 level. The next major support is at $0.5250.
The main support is now near $0.5220 or the 50% Fib retracement level of the upward wave from the $0.5064 swing low to the $0.5386 high. If there is a downside break and a close below the $0.5220 level, the price might accelerate lower. In the stated case, the price could drop and test the $0.5065 support in the near term.
Technical Indicators
Hourly MACD – The MACD for XRP/USD is now losing pace in the bullish zone.
Hourly RSI (Relative Strength Index) – The RSI for XRP/USD is now above the 50 level.
Major Support Levels – $0.5310 and $0.5220.
Major Resistance Levels – $0.5380 and $0.5420.

Sei Foundation Unveils ‘Parallelized’ EVM In v2 Upgrade, Driving 11% Spike In SEI’s Price


																To increase the capabilities of its Layer 1 (L1) blockchain, the Sei Foundation has announced a governance proposal to upgrade Sei to Version 2. This proposed upgrade will reportedly introduce a “high-performance, parallelized” Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) to improve the network’s overall functionality.
Sei Rolls Out Multi-Phase V2 Upgrade
According to the announcement, the Sei V2 launch will be rolled out in three phases to minimize risk, set user expectations, and optimize network performance. “By rolling out Sei v2 in measured steps, Sei Contributors can ensure a stable and scalable network for everyone,” the foundation stated.

	Related Reading



The first phase will focus on validating software upgrades and transitioning the existing Sei Pacific-1 mainnet to the new “v2” iteration. This will pave the way for deploying EVM-based contracts and infrastructure integrations on the Sei network.
The announcement cautioned that “not everything will be functional at the start of this period. “For example, bridges will need time to deploy to Mainnet before the community can use them.” 
However, the foundation promised to provide an official announcement once the v2 network is deemed stable and critical infrastructure, such as RPCs, bridges, indexers, and multi-sigs, is ready for use.
If the governance proposal is accepted, the Sei mainnet upgrade to Version 2 is scheduled for Monday, May 27th.
Interestingly, the announcement of the Sei V2 upgrade has already sparked a surge in the blockchain’s native token, SEI, which has emerged as one of the biggest gainers in the market over the past 24 hours, with a price increase of 11%.
All Eyes On All-Time High On Mainnet Upgrade Prospects
The SEI token is trading at $0.5830, surpassing its previous resistance level of $0.560. This breakthrough aims to consolidate the token’s price above this mark, a key level for the token’s prospects of testing higher resistance walls and potentially reaching its all-time high (ATH) of $1.14, set on March 16.
Furthermore, the token has recorded a trading volume of $95 million since the announcement, resulting in a substantial 150% increase compared to the figures recorded during the previous weekend, according to CoinGecko data.
Despite these positive developments, it remains to be seen whether the governance proposal to upgrade the Sei blockchain to Version 2 will be approved. 

	Related Reading



In the event of a bullish outcome and the successful implementation of the V2 upgrade, the key resistance levels to watch on the upside are $0.592, $0.613, and $0.637. These levels could be potential targets for the token’s continued bullish momentum.
Conversely, should the token experience a price correction, the $0.544 and $0.527 zones would be the levels to monitor for potential support and stabilization of the SEI price in the coming days.

                        As crypto markets lurched higher on Monday on optimism that Ethereum ETFs might soon get approval, renewed risk appetite saw traders hunting for top crypto gainers today flock to the on-chain markets.Ether (ETH) surged a stunning 19% on Monday and was last trading in the $3,600s.If spot Ethereum ETFs get US approval, that would be a huge stamp of approval from regulators for the asset.And it would open the door to a flood of institutional investment, as seen after spot Bitcoin ETF approvals.Bitcoin (BTC) also vaulted higher, gaining 8% on Monday and last trading around $71,000.And altcoin markets were a sea of green. The likes of Pepe (PEPE), Arbitrum (ARB), Optimism (OP) and Uniswap (UNI) all gained around 20% alongside ETH.There is scope for the rally to continue. Macro headwinds have eased this month, with Fed rate cut bets rising following less-hot-than-expected US jobs and CPI inflation data.And Ethereum ETF optimism could be just the catalyst needed to keep the rally going.Major cryptos like Bitcoin, Ether and Solana are above key short-term resistance levels and could retest yearly highs.While the outlook is strong, some crypto traders are looking for higher volatility.The highly illiquid on-chain markets are the perfect place for these highly risk-tolerant traders.New shitcoins and meme coins are launched every single day on blockchains like Solana and Ethereum.Most are scams or pump-and-dumps, and almost none carry long-term value. But in the short term, some do post impressive gains.Here are some top crypto gainers today in the on-chain markets, as per DEX analytics tool DEXScreener.Top Crypto Gainers TodayDogwifmaga (WIFMAGA)A just-launched MAGA-themed version of dogwifhat, dogwifmaga (WIFMAGA) is pumping hard in early Tuesday trade.WIFMAGA last had a market cap of $1.7 million, as per DEXScreener, with just over $100,000 in locked liquidity.https://twitter.com/DogwifmagaCTO/status/1792735559036891324The Trump-supporting spin on the original dogwifhat meme coin just applied to be listed on CoinMarketCap.https://twitter.com/DogwifmagaCTO/status/1792732911789048098The token already has 1,389 followers on X and over 1,000 followers on Telegram.Signs of early community traction don’t mean the token isn’t highly risky.

Traders must always do their own research.Crypto Alternatives to Consider
Altcoins are a great way to make quick gains in crypto. Most of the above-mentioned coins are already too well-established to provide traders with gains of upwards of 10x, however.For those bigger gains, traders will need to get in super early on newer coins.For risk-tolerant investors looking to add upside exposure to their portfolios, presale investing is potentially a good strategy.Web3 startups often sell their token at an early discount in presales to fund development and build hype.With so many presales on the market, it can be tough to know where to start.

Cardano's development soars: Checking the impact on ADA - AMBCrypto



Cardano’s latest report highlighted the work done by different teams last week.
ADA was down by 1.7% in the last 24 hours, and indicators suggested a few slow-moving days.

Cardano [ADA] developers pushed hard last week as the blockchain’s development activity went up. The blockchain recently posted its weekly report, highlighting the efforts made by different teams. Meanwhile, ADA’s price action turned bearish. 
Cardano’s development activity is rising
AMBCrypto’s analysis of Santiment’s data revealed that after a drop, ADA’s development activity graph has risen sharply over the past week. 
Additionally, its development activity contributor count also remained high last week. These are inferred to be positive updates, as high development means more efforts were made to improve the blockchain.
Source: Santiment
Input Output Global recently posted its weekly report that mentioned what new developments happened in the Cardano ecosystem over the last seven days. 
To begin with, the Lace team launched Lace v.1.11, a new update that comes with improved NFT functionality. The update introduced the ability to set a wallet avatar for the user’s favorite NFT and many more. 
The Mithril team, which is a division of ADA’s scaling team, released the new distribution 2418.1. The update was aimed at preventing memory fragmentation. 
Apart from these, the weekly development report also mentioned the updated statistics of the Cardno blockchain. As per the report, ADA’s total number of native tokens reached 10 million.
 The blockchain’s total number of transactions also exceeded 90 million, which looked promising. 
ADA’s bull rally is ending 
While developers pushed their efforts last week, ADA bulls also stepped in as the token’s value increased by nearly 4% in the last seven days. 
However, the trend changed in the last 24 hours as ADA dropped by 1.7%. According to CoinMarketCap, at the time of writing, ADA was trading at $0.4676 with a market capitalization of over $16.6 billion. 
The NVT ratio pointed out a possible reason behind this price correction as the metric shot up. Whenever the metric goes up, it indicates that an asset is overvalued, indicating a possible price decline. 
ADA’s weighted sentiment also dropped, meaning that bearish sentiment around the token was dominant in the market. Another bearish metric was the MVRV ratio, which also went down on the 19th of May.

To see whether this meant an end to ADA’s bull rally, AMBCrypto analyzed its daily chart. We found that its Relative Strength Index (RSI) went sideways near the neutral mark. 
The Chaikin Money Flow (CMF) also followed a similar trend. These indicated that investors might have to witness a few slow-moving days before ADA turns volatile again.

New CryptoPunks NFT Collection Unravels After Backlash to 'Woke' Artwork - Decrypt

CryptoPunks is arguably the most iconic and influential profile picture (PFP) collection in the NFT world, and after getting the project into museums, Yuga Labs has been trying to expand their entry into the art world by letting notable artists riff on the IP with the official Punks stamp.But the first effort, revealed Monday with the launch of a new Punks-branded NFT collection, faced immediate backlash from collectors and crypto observers alike—including claims of “woke” artwork, sometimes accompanied by personal attacks on the artist. Now Yuga is pivoting, and apparently abandoning future plans.Artist Nina Chanel Abney was previously named the inaugural selection for the Punk in Residence program, and over the weekend unveiled her new collection, “Super Punk World.” Following an opening event at The School at the Jack Shainman Gallery in New York, Yuga Labs and Abney revealed the planned NFTs on Monday.The Punk in Residence program was designed to generate on-chain collaborations that foster creative experimentation around the project and NFTs more broadly. Abney's limited-series digital collectibles incorporate her bold style and perspective, reimagining the iconic CryptoPunk traits through her own vision.Nina Chanel Abney (center) with original CryptoPunks creators John Watkinson (left) and Matt Hall (right) of Larva Labs. Photo: Yuga Labs"CryptoPunks are an iconic, pioneering project that has played a crucial role in the creation of the digital collectible space,” Abney told Decrypt ahead of the exhibition. “By collaborating with them, I saw an opportunity to be at the center of a unique intersection of art, technology, and culture."Having previously released a digital art collection titled "Super Cool World" through the Pharrell Williams-backed Gallery of Digital Assets (GODA), Abney is no stranger to expanding her work into the medium. For "Super Punk World," a 500-piece avatar collection, she hand-selected each of the avatars from over 10,000 outputs.This collection, randomly generated and then hand-curated by Abney, draws inspiration from iconic CryptoPunks traits and Super Cool World attributes. Each trait was hand-cut by Abney and digitized to create 195 unique 3D-sculpted attributes, based on 25 personas. These characters, set against colorful backgrounds informed by her previous works and printmaking techniques, embody Abney’s aesthetic and pay homage to the irreverent, early-Web3 roots of the CryptoPunks project."What we wanted to do was kind of introduce wallets and generative art, and Web3 and NFTs, to this more traditional art crowd and group of collectors,” Nathalie Stone, General Manager and Brand Lead of CryptoPunks, told Decrypt last week.A photo from the "Super Punks World" exhibition. Photo: Yuga Labs“We're trying to bring CryptoPunks to the masses here, in a way,” Stone added, “but also have them understand why digital ownership matters.”Abney's digital worldview reflects on virtual versus real-world identities, addressing the pricing disparities between digital avatars based on gender and skin tone. White, male avatars tend to generate higher secondary sale prices than their darker-skinned or female counterparts in prominent NFT collections.Her hybridized figures fuse racial components and aim to blur the lines between masculine and feminine, challenging societal notions of inherent value and pushing viewers to confront their implicit biases. However, after Abney’s riff on CryptoPunks was revealed earlier Monday, the project received substantial backlash across social media.Some commenters have taken aim at the art style itself or the concept of even trying to reimagine an iconic project, while others have levied “woke” accusations due to its emphasis on race and gender, igniting debates about the intersection of art, identity, and digital culture.It has also received negative attention for diluting the original Punks collection, with some collectors upset about Yuga Labs attempting to expand a project is considered a valuable, "blue chip" Ethereum NFT set.Yuga Labs initially declined comment to Decrypt once the backlash began, but early Monday evening, company CEO Greg “Garga” Solano tweeted a statement. The NFT were initially planned to be auctioned, but now will be distributed in some way to Super Cool World NFT holders, potentially through a “randomized airdrop.” And it appears that there will be no follow-up artist residency initiative, at least not in this same fashion.“Yuga will no longer touch Punks,” he wrote. “They will just be decentralized and preserved on the blockchain. The only thing we intend to do is support a few museums and institutions in their quest to acquire a Punk and help educate their audience about them.”Abney affirmed Solano’s statement in a tweet and thanked Yuga Labs for supporting her art and helping the pieces get into the hands of her holders—but then decried the hateful attacks sent her way on social media as a result of the project reveal.“I am utterly disgusted with some of the racist, sexist, homophobic, [and] transphobic comments the controversy around this project has unearthed,” she wrote.“What's really at the underbelly of this space?” Abney continued. “Now more than ever, I will continue my mission toward an inclusive community where everyone is accepted, and ideas that spark productive dialogue are welcomed. No hate tolerated.”Daily Debrief NewsletterStart every day with the top news stories right now, plus original features, a podcast, videos and more.

Trump's Coq (TRUMPCOQ) to Skyrocket 14,000% as KuCoin Listing Announced, While Shiba Inu and Dogecoin Struggle



                    

Trump’s Coq (TRUMPCOQ) could turn early investors into multi-millionaires if it becomes a mainstream coin, like Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE).



Trump’s Coq (TRUMPCOQ), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is poised to explode over 14,000% in price in the coming days.




This is because TRUMPCOQ has announced its first centralized exchange listing, which will be on KuCoin.



This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up.



Currently, Trump’s Coq can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jupiter and Raydium, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days.




Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Trump’s Coq could become the next viral memecoin.



Trump’s Coq launched with over $9,000 of locked liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains.



To buy Trump’s Coq on Raydium or Jupiter ahead of the KuCoin listing, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Trump’s Coq by entering its contract address – DNpRoQjdT95bGpLPvvpR3NnLYnvAWkBHVuqfV3BLzPoY – in the receiving field.



In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price.




If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner.



The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum.



This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like TRUMPCOQ.

Can Ethereum (ETH) Top $4,000 This Week if ETFs Are Approved?


																ETH prices topped $3,700 in an intraday high in early trading in Asia on Tuesday, May 21. It is the highest the asset has been since early April when it spiked to similar levels before dumping below $3,000 a week later.
The massive 20% move has been triggered by renewed hopes that the US Securities and Exchange Commission will approve the first spot ETH ETF from VanEck on May 23.
It is the largest 24-hour move for ETH for more than a year and it has pulled the rest of the crypto market up with it.
Total market cap is up 8.6% on the day to $2.74 trillion with bitcoin closing in on its all-time high tapping $71,600 during trading in Asia on Tuesday morning.
ETH Spot ETF Hopium
In a post on X on May 21, Bitcoin pioneer Anthony Pompliano said:




“If they approve the Ethereum ETF, they are approving the entire industry. This is the last dam to be broken.”
The big move follows commentary from Bloomberg ETF analysts James Seyffart and Eric Balchunas, who increased their approval odds from 25% to 75% on May 20.
Balchunas reported that the SEC wants revised 19b-4 forms returned to them by 10 am on May 21 “for likely approval as soon as Wednesday.”
There are ten issuers vying for America’s first spot Ethereum ETF, including BlackRock, Fidelity, and Grayscale which is aiming to convert its ETHE fund.


VanEck is the first deadline, followed by Ark 21Shares on May 24. The revelation is a turnaround from earlier this week when industry experts predicted that the SEC would procrastinate on approving the S-1 applications for listing the new products on US stock exchanges.
ETF Store President Nate Geraci said that the marriage between crypto and exchange-traded products “remains the most fascinating place in asset management right now.”


Prometheum Launches ETH Custody Service
In a related development, crypto asset trading and custody firm Prometheum has launched a controversial Ethereum custody service, treating the asset as a security, according to reports.
Observers have suggested that this could be in preparation for an SEC denial of ETH ETFs on the grounds that it also considers the asset a security.
However, the recent u-turn in sentiment could suggest the opposite may occur this week.

Solana's Tapswap coin rises post-launch - Here's all you need to know - AMBCrypto



TAPS increased by over 4%.
The community has favored Bybit as their exchange of choice.

Tapswap has generated significant attention, particularly with the recent launch of its TAPS token. The project, which focuses on mining, has seen the TAPS token surge in popularity following its recent Initial Coin Offering (ICO).
TapSwap launches TAPS
Tapswap is built on the Solana blockchain and serves as a trading platform and ecosystem where users can mine, stake, and participate in governance through its token. 
The Tapswap Coin focuses primarily on decentralized finance (DeFi) applications, with a particular emphasis on innovative token mining and decentralized exchange (DEX) functionalities. 
The platform aims to make token mining accessible to a broad audience through a user-friendly clicker game, enhancing the user experience and promoting widespread participation in the DeFi space.
Analyzing the Tapswap tokenomics
According to Tapswap’s tokenomics, the TAPS token will have a total supply of 1 billion tokens. Of this total supply, 500 million TAPS (50%) will be allocated to active community members. 
Additionally, 300 million TAPS (30%) are reserved for platform development, funding innovative projects, and marketing. 
Furthermore, 100 million TAPS (10%) will be allocated to the development team and founders, with these tokens locked and released over four years to ensure alignment with community interests. 
The remaining 10% will support advisory roles, marketing efforts, and liquidity enhancement.
According to the project roadmap, the token launch was part of phase two of the project.
TAPS continues to gain post-launch
Analysis of the Tapswap price trend showed that it traded at around $0.0085 when it launched on 8th May. However, it has seen a significant increase since then.
 At the time of this writing, TAPS was trading at around $0.0106, reflecting an increase of over 5%. The price trend indicates that TAPS has been experiencing substantial daily increases since its launch, with the highest daily increase recorded on 15th May, when it surged by 9.52%.
Source: CoinMarketCap
Despite these gains, TAPS has yet to be listed on any major exchanges. According to a poll on its X page, it might be listed on Bybit first. Additionally, a recent announcement revealed that TapSwap now has 17 million players.

Solana Tops Competition: Blazing Speed To Fuel Price Surge?


																Solana (SOL), the self-proclaimed “world’s fastest blockchain,” has been grabbing headlines for its blazing transaction speeds and surging token price. But is it all sunshine and rainbows in Solana land, or are there cracks in the seemingly smooth road?

Solana Takes The TPS Crown
According to CoinGecko data, Solana blew past competitors like Polygon and Ethereum in transactions per second (TPS). This translates to faster transaction processing times, a key factor for scalability and mass adoption in the blockchain world.
Source: Solana Explorer
However, a closer look reveals a more nuanced picture. While daily active addresses, which represent unique users interacting with the network, have indeed increased, the daily transaction count hasn’t kept pace.
This suggests a scenario where more users are entering the Solana ecosystem, but they aren’t necessarily conducting a high volume of transactions. Is this a case of casual crypto tourists dipping their toes in, or is there something else at play?
Fees Take A Tumble, But Is It A Sustainable Slide?
Another interesting wrinkle is the decline in transaction fees on Solana. This might seem like good news for users, but it could be a double-edged sword. Lower fees could indicate that the transactions being processed are less complex and require lower charges.
Total crypto market cap currently at $2.5 trillion. Chart: TradingView
This could potentially limit Solana’s revenue generation in the long run. Additionally, a drop in fees could signal a decrease in network congestion, which might explain the stagnant daily transaction count.
DeFi Keeps The Party Going, But Caution Flickers
A bright spot for Solana is the continued growth in its Decentralized Finance (DeFi) Total Value Locked (TVL). DeFi refers to a suite of financial services built on blockchains, and TVL represents the total value of crypto assets deposited in DeFi protocols.
Solana’s rising TVL indicates its growing adoption within the DeFi space, where users can lock up their crypto to earn interest or participate in other financial activities. This is a positive sign for the overall health of the Solana ecosystem.

However, a note of caution emerges from technical indicators like the Money Flow Index (MFI). This indicator suggests a potential price correction for SOL, hinting that the current uptrend might not be entirely sustainable.
Combine this with the mixed signals on network activity and the declining fee structure, and investors are left with a question mark hanging over Solana’s long-term prospects.

A Blockchain In High Gear, But the Destination Is Unclear
Solana’s impressive transaction speeds and strong DeFi presence are undeniable strengths. However, the network’s overall activity and tokenomics raise questions about its long-term viability.
Meanwhile, at the time of writing, SOL was trading at $185, up 7.1% and 26.0% in the daily and weekly timeframes, data from Coingecko shows. This price surge, coupled with the network’s breakneck transaction speeds, paints a picture of a project with immense potential.
However, for Solana to truly become a dominant force, it will need to address the questions surrounding its network activity and long-term sustainability, not to mention add more fuel to its price.

The newly acquired supply was worth more than $25 million at prevailing prices.Fickel has been longing ETH/BTC pair since the launch of Bitcoin BTC/USD spot ETFs in January. The founder of Amaranth Foundation has exchanged around 2,741 WBTC for 50,693 ETH since the beginning of the year.However, the bullish sentiment was not restricted to Fickel. In the last 24 hours, the number of traders going long on ETH rose dramatically against those shorting the cryptocurrency, as per the reading of Coinglass' Longs/Shorts Ratio.Why It Matters: Confidence in ETH comes as well-informed analysts raised their odds of a spot ETH ETF approval from 25% to 75%, resulting in a broader market rally. The turnaround in mood comes after months of gloomy expectations from experts about the approval, preventing the cryptocurrency from rising like other assets like Bitcoin.ETH's large transaction volume more than tripled in the last 24 hours, indicating strong engagement from whales, according to IntoTheBlock.

Hacker Mints 5 Billion GALA Tokens in Gala Games Exploit


Gala Games, a Web3 gaming project, faced a significant security breach on May 20. A hacker exploited the platform’s smart contract, minting 5 billion of its native GALA tokens worth approximately $214 million.
This incident has sent shockwaves through the community and sparked widespread speculations.
Gala Games Exploit: Key Details and Community Response

After exploiting the smart contract, the hacker promptly sold 592 million GALA for 5,952 ETH, approximately $21.8 million. The Gala Games team took immediate action to mitigate the damage. They blacklisted the hacker’s address, freezing their ability to offload more tokens.
In a public statement, the team emphasized their commitment to security and transparency. They assured users that they are currently collaborating with law enforcement to track down the perpetrators.

“This was an isolated incident, the cause of which has been addressed. […] We will provide updates as the investigation continues and take all necessary steps to prevent future incidents,” the statement read.

Eric Schiermeyer, CEO of Gala Games, expressed regret over the incident. He noted that the compromise was identified and secured within 45 minutes. Furthermore, he stressed that their ETH contract for GALA remains secure and protected by a multi-signature wallet.

“We messed up our internal controls. This shouldn’t have happened, and we are taking steps to ensure it doesn’t happen again. We believe we have identified the culprit, and we are currently working with the FBI, DOJ, and a network of international authorities. There is the issue of our daily distribution. We will be having a node vote on how to handle this issue. As usual, the community will decide how we proceed,” Schiermeyer said.


Schiermeyer’s acknowledgment of internal control failures aligns with findings by a Solidity developer known as Quit. According to Quit, the address responsible for the exploit had admin-level clearance, allowing it to perform arbitrary actions involving the smart contract. Quit advocates banning contracts with admin privileges capable of arbitrary token minting.
Following the hack, GALA’s price plunged from $0.047 to $0.038. However, it has slightly recovered to $0.041 at the time of writing.

Despite this recovery, fraudulent activity in the community persists. Scammers are capitalizing on the situation by impersonating Gala Games representatives and spreading malicious links under the guise of migrating to a new contract version.

Gala Games CEO admits fault in $240 million token exploit - Crypto Briefing


            
            
                            
            
                            
            
            Following the recent exploit that drained approximately $240 million worth of GALA tokens, Gala Games CEO Eric Schiermeyer responded with a statement, admitting to internal control failures and vowing to improve security measures. He also mentioned that the company has likely identified the perpetrator and is collaborating with the FBI, Department of Justice, and international authorities.“We messed up our internal controls…This shouldn’t have happened and we are taking steps to ensure it doesn’t ever again. We believe we have identified the culprit and we are currently working with the FBI, DOJ and a network of international authorities,” Schiermeyer stated.As reported by Crypto Briefing, an attacker gained unauthorized access to a Gala Games admin address on Monday. The attacker used this access to mint 5 billion new GALA tokens, worth around $200 million at the time, and then successfully sold 600 million newly minted tokens on the decentralized exchange Uniswap.This sale led to a swift 20% drop in the token’s value, from approximately $0.048 to $0.038, according to data from CoinGecko. The security lapse allowed the attacker to profit from roughly $29 million.The breach was initially flagged by 0xQuit, a smart contract developer and security auditor, on Twitter.Gala Games said it took measures to freeze the compromised wallet, effectively rendering the remaining 4.4 billion tokens unsellable and “effectively burned.” Schiermeyer reassured stakeholders that the Ethereum contract for GALA was never at risk, being protected by a multi-signature wallet.“It’s important to note our ETH contract for $GALA is secure and under the protection of a multi-sig wallet. It was never compromised,” he noted.This isn’t the first time Gala Games has faced an exploit. The project reportedly lost $130 million in a similar incident in 2021.Despite the turmoil, GALA’s price has recovered to around $0.04, influenced by a broader market upswing that saw Ethereum’s price increase by 20%.Ethereum surged past $3,500 on Monday after Bloomberg ETF analysts Eric Balchunas and James Seyffart increased their odds of spot Ethereum ETF approval to 75%. Their previous odds were 25%.

GALA Ethereum Contract Exploit Leads To $200 Million Losses - Coincu



	

Key Points:




The GALA Ethereum contract was exploited, leading to the unauthorized minting and sale of 5 billion GALA tokens, worth about $200 million.



The company has advised all token holders to immediately migrate to a new V2 contract before the V1 contract expires at midnight UTC.




Gala Games, one of the largest Web3 gaming protocols, suffered a major security breach on Monday, in which a hacker exploited a smart contract to mint 5 billion GALA tokens, valued at around $200 million. The company urgently advised all its token holders to migrate to a new V2 contract to prevent financial loss.





GALA Ethereum Contract Exploited, 5 Billion GALA Tokens Minted Illegally



The unauthorized minting and sale of these tokens on the Uniswap decentralized exchange made the value of GALA drop by a drastic 15% within hours. In order to contain the damage, Gala Games issued detailed instructions on the migration process through official channels, reminding everyone how important it is to complete the transfer before the old V1 contract expires at midnight UTC. Those who fail to migrate will see the GALA Ethereum contract decommissioned and, hence, face severe financial losses.



An investigation on-chain revealed that the address responsible for the exploit had admin-level clearance, granting it the ability to execute arbitrary actions involving the smart contract. Before the blocklist feature of the GALA Ethereum contract was triggered, the exploiter was able to transfer about $21 million to Ethereum, so preventing more sales. In spite of this, the attacker was able to sell 600 million GALA tokens, which at the time were worth about $29 million.



Scammers Exploit Crisis with Fake Token Migration Events



Scammers posing as Gala Games’ official profile on X, formerly known as Twitter, and advertising a phony token migration event escalated the situation. When consumers interacted with the linked links, the fraudulent schemes presented a serious risk to their funds and displayed slight modifications in the user handle.




Gala Games asks its community to stay vigilant and not follow any migration instructions from any other source but the official one to avoid being scammed. The swift response and precautionary measures are very important for the integrity and value of GALA tokens.

AI cryptos on the move: Should RNDR, GRT and INJ top your list? - AMBCrypto



On-chain metrics were used to analyze the state of three AI coins.
RNDR had a slightly more bullish price action in the past month.

AI cryptos are a promising sector in the crypto ecosystem. The rise of AI through tools such as ChatGPT, Fireflies, Midjourney, SaneBox, and a dozen others aids the automation of everyday tasks at the workplace or with innovation.
Combined with the relatively nascent nature of the AI sector of crypto, it has got denizens wondering if this is the niche to find the next gem.
The top five coins in the AI sector, according to CoinMarketCap, have a combined market capitalization of $21.2 billion. By comparison, the market cap of Dogecoin, the foremost among memecoins, stands at $22.18 billion at press time.
AMBCrypto decided to analyze the on-chain metrics of three of the top five AI cryptos, namely Render [RNDR], The Graph [GRT], and Injective [INJ] to understand holder sentiment and user engagement.
The big question is – Which of these AI coins has the most bullish outlook in the long term?
An introduction to the trio
In the past seven days, Bitcoin [BTC] has gained 8.9%. RNDR has lost 4.9% at press time, while GRT and INJ have rallied 13.9% and 18.1% respectively. This is important because when the market has conviction in an altcoin, it generally has outsized gains compared to Bitcoin.
This does not completely capture the price trends of the three coins in the 1-day timeframe. From a technical analysis perspective, INJ was the weakest among them. Both INJ and GRT have a bearish market structure on the 1-day chart.
Meanwhile, RNDR formed a short-term range below the $11.3 resistance level.
Coming to what the tokens aim to do, Render Network is peer-to-peer and utilizes the blockchain to distribute GPU rendering power. Its goal is to democratize GPU cloud rendering and make it more efficient and scalable.
The Graph is an indexing protocol that allows developers to find and use public data to build decentralized apps. It aims to reduce the costs for developers with its market data and improve server uptime, among other targets.
Injective is a decentralized exchange on the Cosmos blockchain that allows the cross-margin trading, futures, and forex. It is built as a Layer 2 application and uses cross-chain bridges to allow traders to access assets from the Polkadot and Ethereum networks.
Now that we have an idea of what they do, a deeper dive into the metrics of these AI cryptos could be more insightful.
On-chain metrics reflected the price trends to an extent

RNDR had a rising trend of daily active addresses in the past three weeks. However, its development activity values were extremely low at 0.048, for comparison Cardano [ADA] logged 94 at press time.
The weighted sentiment was negative and has largely been that way since the 22nd of March. On the other hand, the mean coin age was trending higher to indicate market-wide accumulation.
The MVRV ratio was near zero, indicating slight profits for holders. Overall, accumulation and active users were positive but the development activity was concerning.

GRT witnessed a downtrend in its daily active addresses since early March. On the other hand, its development activity was reasonable at 12.17 at press time, reaching a peak of 39.4 in May.
Weighted sentiment has picked up over the past week but was negative at press time.
GRT also saw an uptrend in the mean coin age and a positive MVRV ratio. This highlighted accumulation and short-term holders in profit and signaled that there was room for more gains.

Injective, unlike the other two, had a more drastic downward slope to its active users, especially compared to the December peaks. Its development activity was also low at 3.69 at press time, and weighted sentiment was consistently negative.
The mean coin age was also in a steady downtrend and highlighted selling pressure.

Read Render’s [RNDR] Price Prediction 2024-25

In the past three weeks, the price has stabilized above the $20 mark, and its short-term holder profits have increased during the recent rally. Yet, of the three it had the weakest bullish outlook.
With its high daily active users, accumulation trends, and rising prices from the recent lows, Render Network has a good chance of outperforming the other two in the coming weeks.

                        Martin Gruenberg, the chairman of the United States Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC), to step down from his position following an investigation that exposed a toxic workplace culture at the bank regulator.Gruenberg, who has been leading the FDIC since August 2005, made the announcement on May 20, expressing readiness to relinquish his responsibilities once his successor is confirmed, according to a report from Reuters. The investigation, conducted by a third-party, focused on allegations of sexual harassment and other forms of interpersonal misconduct at the FDIC, as well as the management’s response to these incidents.Its findings shed light on the depth of the issues within the organization.Subsequently, on May 15, Gruenberg testified before Congress, facing criticism from both Republicans and Democrats who expressed shock and disappointment at the widespread sexual harassment allegations and mistreatment of subordinates at the FDIC.Lawmakers Called for Martin Gruenberg’s Resignation
Lawmakers, including Senate Banking Chair Sherrod Brown, called for Gruenberg’s resignation, and the White House has confirmed its intention to nominate a new candidate for the FDIC chair position.However, Senator Elizabeth Warren voiced her confidence in Gruenberg’s ability to bring about change within the agency, which was met with criticism from industry veterans.“It is shameful how Elizabeth Warren circled the wagons to keep one of her disgraced puppets in place. I’m so looking forward to the debates,” digital asset industry lawyer John Deaton commented.The crypto community has celebrated Gruenberg’s decision to step down, with individuals like Nic Carter, partner at Castle Island Ventures, calling it “the best day ever.”Gruenberg’s role in facilitating what has been dubbed “Operation Choke Point 2.0,” an effort by the FDIC to discourage banks from providing services to cryptocurrency firms, has drawn criticism.In October 2022, Gruenberg delivered a speech comparing crypto assets to risky financial innovations that played a role in the 2008 financial crisis, such as subprime mortgages and collateralized debt obligations.Anti-Crypto SEC Chair Gary Gensler Remains
Despite Gruenberg’s resignation, the crypto industry still faces one major anti-crypto lawmaker: SEC Chair Gary Gensler.Since assuming the role of SEC Chair, Gensler has adopted a more skeptical approach, using a “poker chips” analogy to describe cryptocurrencies.He warned Congress in October 2021 about the growing stablecoin market, emphasizing the systemic risks associated with it.“I do think that if this continues to grow – and it’s grown about tenfold in the last year – it can present those systemic wide risks,” Gensler said.Gensler increased his crypto crackdown after the collapse of cryptocurrency exchange FTX, which brought allegations of negligence towards the SEC and Gensler himself.In June last year, the SEC sued both Binance, the world’s largest cryptocurrency exchange, and Coinbase, the largest US-based cryptocurrency.The commission filed 13 charges against Binance and its US affiliates, ranging from allegedly operating as an unregistered exchange to offering unregistered securities.The regulator also levied similar charges against Coinbase, claiming that it operated as an exchange, broker, or clearing agency without the required registrations.

Ethereum Surpasses Mastercard by Market Cap


Ethereum, the second-largest cryptocurrency, has now surpassed payments giant Mastercard by market capitalization ($440 billion and $427 billion, respectively). This comes after the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission made an apparent U-turn regarding the approval of spot Ethereum exchange-traded fund applications. As reported by U.Today, Bloomberg analysts suddenly increased the approval odds to 75% despite previously capping them at just 25%. The reassessment was based on some chatter about the SEC rapidly changing its stance. Just days ago, the consensus was that VanEck's ETF filing was going to be shot down by the SEC due to the lack of engagement. According to Eric Balchunas, Bloomberg's senior ETF analyst, the SEC has asked exchanges to swiftly update their 19b-4 filings. The SEC could approve an Ethereum ETF as soon as this Wednesday. Alex Thorn, head of research at Galaxy Digital, claims that the SEC would recognize the underlying as a non-security while staked Ether would be considered to be a security. "That would be somewhat congruent with their various court cases, as well as with reports about their various investigations, and perhaps allow SEC to approve Ethereum ETFs while maintaining their previously stated/arguing opinions," he added. The price of the largest altcoin surged by as much as 16.2% over the past 24 hours, according to CoinGecko data. The price of Bitcoin has also added 6%, peaking at $71,650 earlier today. ETH is still down 25.4% from its all-time high of $4,878 which was achieved two years ago.

Bitcoin Could Reach $420K With 1% Global Asset Allocation, Predicts Financial Guru Ric Edelman - Benzinga

Renowned financial advisor Ric Edelman has made a bold prediction about the future of Bitcoin BTC/USD, suggesting that the cryptocurrency could reach a staggering $420,000.What Happened: Edelman, the founder of the Digital Assets Council of Financial Professionals, recently shared his forecast in an interview with Yahoo Finance's "Wealth." He based his prediction on the potential impact of planned allocations from financial advisors, which could drive up the price of Bitcoin.Edelman’s analysis suggests that if 1% of the world’s $740 trillion in financial assets were to be invested in Bitcoin, it could result in $7.4 trillion in inflows, ultimately raising the price of Bitcoin to $420,000. “If everybody who owns those assets were to simply allocate 1% to Bitcoin, that would represent a market cap of $7.4 trillion that translates to 420 grand per Bitcoin,” he said See Also: Top Trader Ditches Bitcoin For Altcoins, ‘Dogecoin Killer’ Shiba Inu’s Potential Breakout And MoreWhy It Matters: The prediction from Edelman comes at a time when Bitcoin has been a topic of intense debate. Just a few days ago, well-known economist and Bitcoin critic Peter Schiff tried to downplay Bitcoin’s recent surge, highlighting its underperformance relative to silver. However, Edelman’s prediction suggests a very different future for the cryptocurrency.Moreover, Edelman’s forecast aligns with the growing interest in Bitcoin among institutional investors. Just a few days ago, Anthony Scaramucci, the founder of SkyBridge Capital and a former ally of ex-President Donald Trump, predicted that more pension funds will soon include Bitcoin in their investment portfolios. Despite the ongoing debates about Bitcoin’s future, its popularity continues to grow. As the Bitcoin price surges, investors who have lost access to their accounts are turning to crypto wallet recovery firms in droves.The cryptocurrency market rallied handsomely on Monday over increased odds of approval of spot Ethereum ETH/USD ETFs, with Bitcoin coming close to breaking its all-time highs.Price Action: Bitcoin is currently trading at $70,846, marking a 0.82% decrease in the last 24 hours. Despite this short-term dip, the King Crypto has seen a remarkable 60.39% increase in value since the beginning of the year, according to the data from Benzinga Pro.Read Next: Bitcoin Smashes $70K, Ethereum Pumps 12% On ETF Approval Bombshell: ‘Odds Of Approval 75%,’ Tweets ETF AnalystImage Via Shutterstock Engineered by Benzinga Neuro, Edited by Kaustubh BagalkoteThe GPT-4-based Benzinga Neuro content generation system exploits the extensive Benzinga Ecosystem, including native data, APIs, and more to create comprehensive and timely stories for you.

BingX CPO Vivien Lin on 6 Years and Its Bold Plans


							
Looking for insights into the crypto world? Dive into our interview with Vivien Lin, Chief Product Officer at BingX, where we explore their unique approach in a crowded market. From innovative solutions to strategic partnerships, discover how BingX is reshaping the exchange game and gearing up for global expansion. Plus, get Lin’s take on the recent Bitcoin halving and lessons learned for ongoing success.



1. How does BingX differentiate itself from other platforms, and what makes its approach unique?























At BingX, we’re all about putting our users first. Building a crypto exchange? Sure, that’s exciting. But what really sets us apart is our commitment to cultivating a community that resonates with traders of all levels.



Let’s dive into a quick example to show what we mean. We noticed that traders weren’t too happy about slippage when setting their take profit/stop loss orders, despite our efforts to collaborate with liquidity providers to stabilize the market for perpetual contracts. So, we went back to the drawing board, searching for a clearer way to tackle this pesky issue.



Enter our innovative solution: for a nominal fee — just a few basis points — we offer price protection. This means we guarantee our users’ trade will execute at the price they set, with no surprises. And here’s the kicker: unlike complex options, our price protection feature is straightforward, without the headache of having to understand maturities or strike prices. It’s just simple, effective, and perfectly aligned with what the users expect. This is just one way we’re rethinking the exchange game to ensure it’s winning for users.



2. Reflecting on BingX’s 6th anniversary, what are the key milestones or achievements that stand out to you the most?







As we celebrate BingX’s 6th Anniversary, it’s quite the journey to look back on. Not everyone realizes that BingX has been around for six years. During this time, we’ve chosen a path of quiet growth, focusing our energies on delivering the best possible experience to our 10 million users. Perhaps one of our proudest achievements is being the first exchange to introduce revolutionary copy trading features to crypto trading. This innovative approach has not only set us apart but has significantly enhanced the trading experience on our platform.



Our dedication and hard work have paid off, propelling BingX to great heights. We’ve seen remarkable success, with our trading volume skyrocketing to an impressive $12 billion per day. Furthermore, the platform now boasts a diverse portfolio with 750 new tokens listed, and we’ve expanded our language support to 18 languages. These milestones are a testament to the incredible progress we’ve made.



But, as we reflect on our past achievements, we’re also looking to the future. It’s time for a strategy shift. While our commitment to our users remains unwavering — they will always be our top priority — we’re gearing up to take BingX global. This year marks a significant push in our global expansion strategy, aiming to introduce BingX’s unique products and services to more markets worldwide.



You’ll soon find BingX making its mark in various corners of the globe. Yet, as we expand, we’re not losing sight of what’s important: customizing our products and services to meet the specific needs of each market. We understand that each region has its unique challenges and opportunities, and we are committed to tailoring our offerings to ensure we meet, and exceed, the expectations of our users, no matter where they are



3. Could you share any standout moments or insights you gained from attending the TOKEN2049 conference?







Attending TOKEN2049 was an absolute ride, and I’ve got loads to share! First off, let’s just say that when it comes to the crypto community, there’s no stopping us. Despite the floods in Dubai, we all somehow made it. Picture this: some of our colleagues, determined not to miss out, ended up in Oman thanks to the weather but still managed to join the event. Now if that’s not commitment, I don’t know what is!



 And let’s not forget the backdrop to all this excitement. After two rather silent years, where it felt like everything was on pause, this conference was a burst of energy. It was like watching the crypto world come back to life in the most vibrant way. Bitcoin and cryptocurrency, despite the ups and downs, have this incredible knack for bouncing back. It’s resilience and energy like nothing else.



Being there, seeing the determination and passion, really impressed upon me how unstoppable the Bitcoin and cryptocurrency movement is. It’s more than just transactions and technology; it’s about the community, the drive, and this undeniable force that keeps pushing us forward. So yeah, TOKEN2049 wasn’t just another conference. It was a testament to the spirit of the crypto world, proving yet again that we can weather any storm (literally!) and come out stronger.



4. Can you explain how BingX teaming up with Chelsea FC fits into the company’s goals or plans?







This strategic partnership marks BingX’s inaugural foray into sports and entertainment and a testament to shared commitments to excellence. It unites two industry powerhouses poised to shape the future. It is always important for us to pick brands that strategically align with us. Both BingX and Chelsea F.C. share a passion and commitment to investing in the future and empowering those who are close to the respective brands.



In this dynamic partnership, Chelsea and BingX have collaborated on a range of activities focusing on global brand growth and engaging both Chelsea fans and BingX users through exciting digital and physical content. We recently kicked off celebrating Empowered with Chelsea F.C., showing empowerment isn’t just a word, but a daily commitment to growth and support. BingX will connect with hundreds of millions of loyal Chelsea fans worldwide and billions tuning into the Premier League each season.



5. What’s your take on the recent Bitcoin halving’s impact on BingX and the broader cryptocurrency market?







While important, the Bitcoin halving didn’t directly impact BingX since we solely facilitate the buying and selling of Bitcoin. We did, however, host various trading events to commemorate the halving occasion, which is special and unique to the asset, highlighting its scarcity. 



The impact of the halving on the greater cryptocurrency market is still being felt. However, while prices typically dip in a retrace phase following the halving, it is difficult to solely point a finger to this halving for the dip in the market. With so many micro and macroeconomic events happening, investors were sent  into a risk-off mode, selling assets like Bitcoin. Therefore, the halving should be looked at not independently but as a factor of the broader cryptocurrency market.



6. What important lessons have you learned as BingX’s Chief Product Officer for its ongoing growth and success?







The most important lesson I’ve learned is to always be user-centric. This encompasses listening to both new and long-term users so your entire ecosystem can maintain retention. As we have seen, the market has grown and changed from 2022 to now. The companies that have weathered the storm are those that develop and launch products that cater directly to what the user needs. Ensuring products are user-friendly will also give you the edge.

House Democrats Choose "No Whip" Stance on FIT21 Crypto Bill


In a recent development, a report revealed that the House Democrats leaders have stated that they will not whip against the Financial Innovation and Technology for the 21st Century Act (FIT21).
This stance is seen as significant given the ongoing debate over regulating cryptocurrencies and digital commodities.
Background and Concerns Raised by House Democrats

Eleanor Mueller, a reporter at Politico, recently shared an email from the House Democrats regarding the FIT21 Act bill. The email outlines a quick background of the bill and the House Democrat’s overall perspective.
It highlights concerns about language in the bill that treats digital assets sold as “investment contracts” as non-securities, allowing them to be traded in the secondary market. The email notes this language undermines decades of legal precedent, creating uncertainty in traditional securities markets.

“The bill also provides a safe harbor in which entities can file an ‘intent to register’ if they meet certain requirements, effectively shielding them from SEC rules and regulations until the SEC and CFTC finalize their rules, which weakens investor protections and opens the door to fraud and market manipulation,” the email reads.

While the email does not urge the Democrats to vote “no,” it states that Ranking Member Maxine Waters strongly opposes the bill. Ranking Members Waters and David Scott sent a letter to their colleagues to vote “no” on the bill.
They express concerns that the bill would result in the mass deregulation of crypto and some traditional securities. Furthermore, they see this deregulation would severely undermine US capital markets by removing key protections for investors and consumers.

“The entities that stand to benefit from this bill are not ordinary investors trying to build wealth but rather the crypto firms that have chosen not to register with the SEC or otherwise comply with the securities laws. They have already made billions of dollars unlawfully issuing or facilitating the buying and selling of crypto securities. Many of these firms, like Coinbase, are being sued by the SEC for breaking our nation’s securities laws. Now, rather than comply with the law, these firms are lobbying Congress to legitimize their illegal activities,” Ranking Members Waters and Scott wrote in their joint letter.

Conversely, Republican House Financial Services Committee lawmakers announced that the House will vote on the FIT21 legislation this week.
Support and Legislative Progress for FIT21
FIT21 was introduced in July 2023 by Chairman Glenn “GT” Thompson and co-sponsored by several prominent Republicans. It aims to establish clear federal requirements for digital asset markets and balance innovation with robust consumer protections.

Several industry advocates and House members support the bill. The Blockchain Association and Crypto Council for Innovation have both called on House leadership to support FIT21. The Blockchain Association recently sent a letter to House Speaker Mike Johnson and Rep. Hakeem Jeffries, advocating for a floor vote.

“The policy issues facing our industry are complex – and passing this legislation in the House will enable further discussion and debate in the Senate. Therefore, our members urge the House of Representatives to vote “yes” on H.R. 4763,” the Blockchain Association explained.

Besides FIT21, other crypto-focused legislation is also progressing. BeInCrypto recently reported that the US Senate voted to pass H.J. Res 109, a resolution to overturn the SEC’s controversial Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 121 (SAB 121). However, it did not secure enough votes to be veto-proof. President Joe Biden has vowed to veto the resolution, arguing that overturning SAB 121 would weaken the SEC’s ability to protect investors and the financial system from crypto-related risks.

                        Former Congressman Kendrick Meek (D-Fla.) is hopping on board Coinbase’s global advisory council, The Hill reported on Monday.Faryar Shirzad, Coinbase’s chief policy officer, welcomed Kendrick for his experienced leadership, noting its importance in updating the system, especially with 52 million Americans diving into the crypto economy.Meek’s appointment to the council comes just before the House vote on the Financial Innovation and Technology for the 21st Century Act (FIT21).The new legislation aims to clarify how digital assets are regulated. It assigns clear roles to the Securities and Exchange Commission and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission. Specifically, the law would give the CFTC more power to oversee most cryptocurrencies, treating them like commodities.The bill cruised through the House Agriculture and Financial Services committees last summer with backing from both parties. But it needs Democrat votes to pass the full House on Wednesday.Former Congressman Champions Crypto for Underserved Communities
Meek served in the House of Representatives for Florida’s 17th Congressional District from 2003 to 2011. He also held positions on the House Ways and Means Committee, the Democratic Steering and Policy Committee, and the Congressional Black Caucus. Additionally, he chaired the board of directors of the Congressional Black Caucus Foundation.“As we work to address the compounding economic stressors of the traditional financial system, digital assets offer new opportunities to address the systemic issues that have plagued our financial system and failed too many Americans,” Meek said in a statement.“And for Black and Hispanic Americans and other underserved communities, the need for a more equitable and inclusive financial system has never been more urgent.”The ex-congressman joins a high-profile council of Washington insiders.Last November, Coinbase welcomed former Defense Secretary Mark Esper, former Rep. Stephanie Murphy, and other policy heavyweights to the global advisory council, launched in May. Its initial members included former Sen. Patrick Toomey and former Reps. Tim Ryan and Sean Patrick Maloney. Maloney stepped down earlier this year.“I’m looking forward to using my seat on the Council to support American leadership in shaping the future of digital assets and building in protections for vulnerable communities,” Meek said.First Crypto Regulation in US Could Be Near Pending FIT21 Approval
On Monday, the Blockchain Association called for a full House floor vote on the FIT21 initiative. If both the House and the Senate approve, it would represent the first crypto-focused regulation
in the US.Regulators in the US have faced criticism for their handling of the crypto industry, particularly the SEC for its enforcement-oriented regulation.

                        The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) is requiring exchanges to update their spot Ethereum exchange-traded fund (ETF) filings.According to a recent post shared by Bloomberg Intelligence ETF analyst Eric Balchunas, the SEC is asking the applicants to file new Form 19b-4 on an “accelerated basis” to inform the Commission of a proposed rule change.Spot Ethereum ETF Approval Odds 75%: Analysts
The post suggested that this move indicated the SEC’s tendency to approve the Ethereum ETF applications by the Thursday deadline, marking potential issuance of the second spot digital asset ETF in the United States.Balchunas and another Bloomberg ETF analyst James Seyffart estimated that the odds of Ethereum ETF approval increased significantly from the previous 25% to the current 75%. The prediction was made before the updated Form 19b-4 request.The ETF Store president Nate Geraci said in a social media post that the SEC must approve both the 19b-4s and S-1s for exchange rule changes and registration statements so the ETFs can launch.Though a part of the crypto community has been expecting an approval, Balchunas believed that it was merely “wishcasting.”US Crypto Policy Could Do a 180
“If the spot ETH ETF is approved, it will be a true shock to everyone I know in DC who’s close to this process,” said Variant Fund Chief Legal Officer Jake Chervinsky. “That doesn’t mean it won’t happen.”“It means approval could signal a major shift in US crypto policy after the SAB 121 vote, perhaps more important than the ETF itself,” said Chervinsky.Seyffart seconded Chervinsky’s statement, saying, “This is the correct take. I was literally in DC last week for @PerianneDC’s Blockchain Summit and almost every single person I spoke to said that it was going to be denied.”The Biden administration could look more crypto-friendly once the ETFs are approved. Former CFTC commissioner Chris Giancarlo recently said that Donald Trump is the “First Crypto President,” who is running for re-election.

Ripple Vs. SEC Reaches Climax With Final Filing: Details


								The legal battle between Ripple Labs and the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has intensified with the SEC’s latest court filing, marking the final submission before Judge Analisa Torres of the Southern District of New York deliberates on the remedies phase of this landmark case.
Ripple Vs. SEC: The Final Move
In its filing dated May 20, 2024, the SEC provided a comprehensive rebuttal to Ripple’s request to seal certain financial documents and other evidence crucial to the case. The SEC’s letter to Judge Torres articulates a staunch opposition to Ripple’s motion, particularly concerning the concealment of financial data and contractual terms integral to the Court’s evaluation of appropriate remedies.

The SEC’s opposition hinges on the principle of public access to judicial documents, a cornerstone of legal transparency and accountability. Citing Lugosch v. Pyramid Co. of Onondaga, the SEC emphasizes the historical importance of public access, especially in cases that involve public interest and regulatory enforcement. “The common law right of public access to judicial documents is firmly rooted in our nation’s history,” the SEC forcefully argues in its brief, highlighting the necessity of transparency for public scrutiny and trust.
While the SEC consents to the sealing of five exhibits in their entirety, it contests the company’s request to withhold key financial figures and terms of contracts cited in the remedy deliberations. This includes details that would reveal Ripple’s current financial health, the volume of recent XRP sales, and the specifics of revenue and expenses—all deemed vital for assessing the company’s compliance and determining any potential penalties.
The SEC critically assesses the motives for sealing: “Ripple invites the public to form opinions about the merits of the SEC’s positions. It cannot simultaneously hide from them the evidence on which that position is based,” the SEC stated, pointing to a contradiction in the company’s public communications versus its courtroom requests.

Ripple’s justification for its sealing requests cites the potential harm that public disclosure of sensitive financial details could inflict on its competitive position in the market. However, the SEC counters this by highlighting inconsistencies in Ripple’s argument about the relevance and sensitivity of the information.
The Commission challenges the claim that the sealed information is irrelevant, stating, “Once an item is deemed relevant to the exercise of judicial power, the weight to be given the presumption of access must be governed by the role of the material at issue in the exercise of Article III judicial power.”
The SEC also notes the staleness of some information Ripple wishes to seal, arguing that financial details from years past are unlikely to impact Ripple’s current business operations significantly. “Stale business records cannot support the necessary finding of harm,” the SEC argues, reinforcing its stance on the need for transparency of outdated financial records.
As Judge Torres prepares to make her ruling, the crypto industry watches closely. The stakes are notably high, with the SEC proposing fines and penalties amounting to approximately $2 billion, while Ripple’s counteroffer recommends a maximum penalty of merely $10 million.
Notably, the only remaining step in the Ripple vs. SEC case before Judge Torres can issue her final decision is for Judge Netburn to determine whether Andrea Fox is a summary or expert witness. However this decision alone could potentially lead to further complications.
At press time, XRP traded at $0.53487.

SEC may let Ethereum spot ETFs happen, but not with staked ETH: Galaxy Digital Head of Research - Crypto Briefing


            
            
                            
            
                            
            
            The US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) may greenlight spot Ethereum exchange-traded funds (ETFs) that do not include the staking feature, suggests Alex Thorn, Head of Research at Galaxy Digital. He believes the SEC would distinguish Ethereum (ETH) and staked ETH in the approval process.“If the speculation about a 180 from SEC on the Ethereum ETFs is true, I would guess they try to thread a needle between “ETH” NOT being a security and “staked ETH” (or even more flimsily, “staking as a service ETH”) as BEING a security,” he stated.According to Thorn, by setting clear boundaries between ETH and staked ETH, the SEC could approve spot Ethereum ETFs without contradicting its past actions, including the alleged investigation into the Ethereum Foundation and entities associated with Ethereum, like Consensys.“In this case and perhaps for other reasons, you would expect [the] SEC to prohibit the ETFs from staking the ETH they hold,” he added.Recent comments from Bloomberg ETF analysts James Seyffart and Eric Balchunas have fueled the conversation around the SEC’s potential shift in stance.The two analysts said on Monday that the odds for a spot Ethereum ETF approval had increased to 75%. Balchunas noted that the key factor appears to be a “political issue.”Commenting on a post by Scott Johnsson, Van Buren Capital’s general partner, regarding the matter, Bloomberg ETF analyst James Seyffart suggested that the removal of staking could be the deciding factor.The SEC’s decision on VanEck’s spot Ethereum ETF is expected by May 23, and the ARK21 Shares Ethereum ETF’s deadline follows on May 24.Middle groundApart from the latest development, exchanges seeking to list and trade shares of spot Ethereum ETFs have reportedly been asked to revise their 19b-4 filings. This suggests another scenario: the SEC may approve 19b-4s for spot Ethereum ETF but delay S-1 applications.For an ETF to be approved and begin trading, the issuer needs the SEC to approve two applications: a 19b-4 application, which grants regulatory approval for its listing, and an S-1 application, which lets the ETF launch and operate fully.In short, while a 19b-4 might be technically approved without an S-1, the ETF would not be operable without an S-1’s approval. Trading on the spot Bitcoin ETFs began just a few days after both applications were approved around the same time.The SEC may want to avoid backlash from the crypto community, but it may not be comfortable allowing spot Ethereum ETFs on the market just yet.To achieve this middle ground, the SEC may consider approving the 19b-4 for the general product but delaying the approval of any specific S-1 applications from issuers. This approach would let the agency effectively stall the launch of specific Ethereum ETFs until further scrutiny.The SEC’s consideration of spot Ethereum ETFs comes amid intensifying regulatory scrutiny of crypto in the US.Crypto has increasingly become a political flashpoint between the two parties that dominate American politics. There have been signs that Democrats are leaning more toward tightening enforcement, though not all Democrats are against crypto. Last Thursday, 21 Democrats joined Republicans in voting for a resolution to overturn the SEC’s Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 121 (SAB 121).Under the leadership of the Biden administration, the US has been known for its regulatory crackdown on the industry. The US SEC makes itself an example of this skeptical approach. The federal agency’s legal actions against crypto entities have been an ongoing topic of discussion over the past few years.

                        Taiwanese national and dark web drug dealer Rui-Siang Lin, ‘Pharaoh’, who allegedly made more than $100 million in cryptocurrency sales of illegal narcotics, has been arrested by U.S. authorities.Lin used the identity “Pharoah” to operate the online “Incognito Market” for nearly four years and was arrested at New York’s John F. Kennedy Airport on Saturday. Lin allegedly sold illegal narcotics including deadly fentanyl to customers around the world, said the U.S. attorney’s office in a statement.To capture Lin successfully, U.S. authorities and FBI worked with the El Dorado Task Force’s Darkweb and Cryptocurrency Task Force using cutting-edge techniques targeting savvy criminals.Charges Against the Pharoah
According to the statement, Lin is being charged with one count of engaging in a continuing criminal enterprise, which carries a mandatory minimum sentence of life in prison. One count of narcotics conspiracy, which carries a mandatory minimum sentence of 10 years in prison and a maximum potential sentence of life in prison.One count of money laundering, which carries a maximum potential sentence of 20 years in prison; and one count of conspiracy to sell adulterated and misbranded medication, which carries a maximum potential sentence of five years in prison.“As alleged, Rui-Siang Lin operated a sophisticated and dangerous online narcotics marketplace through which he profited millions of dollars at the community’s expense,” said U.S. Attorney Damian Williams, in the press release.“The dedicated prosecutors from the Southern District of New York and our law enforcement partners will pursue criminal actors regardless of whether they operate on street corners or in the dark corners of the internet.  The so-called ‘dark web’ is not a safe haven for those who seek to break the law,” added Williams.Incognito Market Operated for Four Years
‘Pharaoh’ allegedly operated the Incognito Market, which the FBI describes as “one of the largest online platforms for narcotics sales” for almost four years. The platform conducted $100 million in illicit narcotics transactions and reaped millions of dollars in personal profits.Each listing on the Incognito Market was sold by a particular vendor which paid 5% from every transaction to ‘Pharaoh’. This fee then funded Incognito Market’s operations, including paying its employee salaries and for computer servers.To facilitate the transactions, Incognito Market had its own bank, which allowed its users to deposit cryptocurrencies on the site into their own “bank accounts.”  After a narcotics transaction was completed, crypto from the buyer’s bank account was transferred to the seller’s bank account, less the 5% fee that Incognito collected, said the U.S. authorities.“Under the promise of anonymity, Lin’s alleged operation offered the purchase of lethal drugs and fraudulent prescription medication on a global scale.  The FBI is committed to targeting and dismantling all criminal enterprises, especially those whose leaders distribute illegal substances on the dark web,” said FBI Assistant Director in Charge James Smith.

SEC Chair Gary Gensler Mocked By Popular Crypto Analyst After Spot Ethereum ETF Progress: 'His Meltdown Would Be Historic' - Benzinga

Prominent crypto market observer and founder of venture fund Cinneamhain Ventures, Adam Cochran, took a dig at SEC Chair Gary Gensler over the latter's stance on Ethereum ETH/USD being a security.What Happened: Cochran, one of the fiercest critics of Gensler, took to social platform X mocking the SEC Chief's duplicitous position on categorizing cryptocurrencies as securities.He wrote, "I'd love to see @iampaulgrewal ask @GaryGensler in court to explain the difference between ETH (a non-security) and the countless assets he claimed are securities in their cases." Cochran went to the extent of saying, "His meltdown would be historic."Cochran mentioned Paul Grewal, Coinbase’s Chief Legal Officer — an outspoken critic of Gensler himself who has maintained throughout that Ether is a security. He had previously remarked that the regulator has “no good reason” to deny the ETF applications Why It Matters: Cochran's remarks come as the SEC reportedly moved forward with the spot Ether ETF applications, asking issuers to revise their 19b-4 filings.This move, combined with Bloomberg analysts boosting their odds of a spot ETH approval, has prompted experts to assume that the SEC no longer considers ETH security. Several reports in recent months have alleged a planned move by the SEC to brand the cryptocurrency as a security. Gary Gensler has tiptoed around the issue, leaving an element of uncertainty regarding the SEC's actual position.Image from Shutterstock and Third Way Think Tank on FlickrPrice Action: At the time of writing, ETH was exchanging hands at $3,648.03, following a 16% bounce in the last 24 hours, according to data from Benzinga Pro.Read Next: Big Ethereum Whale Adds On To Bullish Long Position As Spot ETF Approval Probability Jumps — Swaps Wrapped Bitcoin Worth Over $25M For ETH

Mapping Litecoin's next move this bull cycle as BTC hits $71k - AMBCrypto



Even as LTC makes no appearance in a lot of portfolios, data shows that it is more stable than BTC and ETH.
Both the RSI and MACD are showing clear bull signals.

Litecoin [LTC] is one of the oldest cryptocurrencies in the world and yet, one of the most undervalued. Historically, LTC has never been an investor favorite even as it proves to be relatively more stable than Ethereum [ETH] or even Bitcoin [BTC] in recent years.
It rarely comes up in expert suggestions or analyses, and sometimes even gets mocked. But data shows that Litecoin has some strong potentials in this bull cycle. Let’s break them down.
Examining LTC’s True Potential
Taking a look at LTC’s trading chart, we see that the RSI is near the lower end, indicating that Litecoin is undervalued. It is the perfect opportunity for investors or traders who believe in its fundamentals and long-term prospects. 
Moreover, the MACD shows convergence (shorter-term moving average crosses above the longer-term average), increasing bullish momentum, supporting the case for a potential upswing for the underestimated altcoin.

At press time, LTC was worth $87. We see that over the past month, $77 has acted as a major support level, where price rebounds have occurred multiple times throughout the month. 
It is both a strong psychological and a technical support zone. But Litecoin did not fall below the support since February, showcasing its resilience even as Bitcoin and Ether were plunging. 
$81.00 to $85.00 seems to be where Litecoin has spent a considerable amount of time oscillating within the month. The breakout to $87 will see LTC aiming for $90 in the short-term.
Are investors waking up?
Interestingly, the whales seem to finally be waking up. Recent data from IntoTheBlock reveals that on 10th May, whales accumulated nearly three million LTC coins, worth over $900k at press time. 
Historically, LTC follows a clear pattern in each cycle. Prices stay stable during the halvings until about 4-5 months after the Bitcoin halving. After that, the price usually shoots up. If this pattern holds, we can expect the price to rise towards the end of Q3 this year.

The whale purchases have reignited talks of LTC on crypto Twitter, albeit only slightly.
 But data says more than social sentiment, and the verdict from examining historical patterns is that LTC could skyrocket starting around August or September.

Ether (ETH) ETF Hopes Drive Futures Open Interest to Record $14B

Late Monday, Bloomberg's ETF analysts increased the probability of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) green lighting the spot ETH ETFs to 75% from 25%. Meanwhile, CoinDesk reported that the SEC had asked exchanges looking to list and trade potential spot ether ETFs to update 19b-4 filings on an accelerated basis, a sign of the regulator attempting to fast-track the process.

Crypto Leads FBI to $100 Million Incognito Market's Drug Kingpin


The FBI tracked Rui-Siang Lin, a 23-year-old alleged to control a notorious dark web marketplace. This development marks a significant breakthrough in combating cyber-enabled drug distribution. 
Lin, who reportedly oversaw a multimillion-dollar operation, was traced and captured through meticulous analysis of crypto transactions linked to drug sales.
How FBI Tracked Incognito Market Owner

Initiated in October 2020, Incognito Market quickly rose to infamy, facilitating over $100 million in illicit drug transactions until its closure in March 2024. Operating under the pseudonym “Pharoah,” Lin orchestrated all aspects of the operation. 
His platform allegedly sold dangerous narcotics, including heroin, cocaine, and counterfeit pills.
The unraveling of Lin’s empire began when the FBI detected crypto transfers from Incognito Market to a centralized exchange. FBI task force officer Mark Rubens explained how Lin’s wallet received funds from the Incognito Market. 
Lin used to convert the funds from Bitcoin (BTC) to Monero (XMR) through a swapping service, enhancing their anonymity. These funds were subsequently deposited into a centralized exchange account under Lin’s name.


“Documents from the centralized exchange indicate that its user provided a mobile number, email address, and a Taiwanese Driver’s License as proof of identity. The Taiwanese Driver’s License lists an address in Taipei, Taiwan, and the name is “林睿庠,” which is the Mandarin language spelling of Rui-Siang Lin,” Rubens wrote.

Incognito Market mimicked legitimate e-commerce platforms, complete with customer service, branding, and a vendor registration system. Vendors paid a 5% commission on their sales, generating revenue that supported the site’s operations and Lin’s profits. 
Court documents reveal that as Incognito Market grew, so did the deposits into Lin’s accounts, escalating from about $63,000 in 2021 to nearly $4.2 million by 2023.
The dangers of Lin’s operation were highlighted during undercover investigations, where drugs sold as safe medications turned out to be deadly. For instance, pills purported to be oxycodone were actually fentanyl, significantly increasing the risk to public health.

The US authorities arrested Lin at John F. Kennedy Airport on May 18, 2024, effectively ending his illegal activities. He now faces multiple charges, including engaging in a criminal enterprise and conspiracy to sell adulterated medication, with potential penalties ranging from 10 years to lifetime in prison.

“As alleged, Rui-Siang Lin’s brazen operation resulted in the illicit sale of over $100 million in narcotics, including those that were mislabeled and later found to include deadly fentanyl.  The El Dorado Task Force’s Darkweb and Cryptocurrency Task Force leverages cutting-edge techniques to target even the Internet’s most savvy criminals,” HSI Special Agent Ivan J. Arvelo said. 

Indeed, Lin’s arrest is part of a larger trend in the fight against crypto-facilitated crimes. Last week, the Department of Justice arrested two brothers who allegedly conducted a $25 million theft on the Ethereum blockchain.

Watch Out! Dogecoin Creator Warns Of Exploding Social Media Ad Scams


								Dogecoin creator Billy Markus, the internet personality also known as “Shibetoshi Nakamoto,” fired a shot across the bow of social media advertising with a recent critique.
Markus, a major figure in the cryptocurrency world, took to his favorite platform, X, to express his frustration with the prevalence of scam ads. This issue has long been a thorn in the side of crypto users, who have repeatedly been targeted by fraudulent schemes on social media platforms.

Markus’s message struck a chord with the crypto community, long plagued by fraudulent activities on social media platforms. Projects like Shiba Inu and Ripple have consistently warned their communities about these dangers, highlighting the pervasiveness of the problem.
Click Here, Steal Your Crypto: The Malware Menace
The Dogecoin founder’s core argument hinges on the prevalence of “malvertising” – deceptive ads that embed malware designed to steal user data or hijack devices. These malicious tactics not only erode user trust but also push them towards employing ad blockers, essentially shutting out legitimate advertisers.


Dogecoin: Crypto Scams Get Cunning
Beyond malware, the cryptocurrency world itself has become fertile ground for elaborate scams. A recent heist, where a Bitcoin whale lost over 1,000 BTC, exemplifies the vulnerability of users to social engineering and cleverly disguised fraud. This incident highlights the evolving tactics scammers employ within the crypto space.
Dogecoin is currently trading at $0.16. Chart: TradingView
Building A Safer Web3
Markus’s message serves as a clarion call for a multi-faceted approach to tackle scam ads and build trust in the Web3 landscape. Advertisers need to prioritize user safety and eliminate all forms of deceptive content. This includes stricter vetting processes and a commitment to ethical marketing practices.

Crypto influencers and project leaders have a crucial role to play in educating users about common scams and red flags to watch out for. Social media platforms like X need to invest in robust detection and prevention measures to weed out scam ads and protect their user base.
The Dogecoin founder’s message may have been delivered with a dose of internet sass, but the underlying issue is no laughing matter. By working together, advertisers, social media platforms, and the crypto community can create a safer online environment for everyone, paving the way for a future where innovation thrives without the constant shadow of deceit.

Michael Saylor Says 'The Price Of BTC Is Still Less Than $0.08M' As King Crypto Within Touching Distance Of A New ATH - MicroStrategy (NASDAQ:MSTR) - Benzinga

MicroStrategy Inc. MSTR co-founder and one of the biggest Bitcoin BTC/USD advocates, Michael Saylor, deemed the King Crypto's recent surge as just the beginning, subtly hinting at its enormous potential.What Happened: Saylor took to social platform X to remark, "The price of $BTC is still less than $0.08M." In other words it was less than $80,000.One of the biggest Bitcoin whales, Saylor cheered other proponents like him, many of whom believe in the cryptocurrency’s million-dollar potential.Why It Matters: It is noteworthy that previously Saylor has made similar declarations. In February, he reminded his followers on X that the value of Bitcoin was less than $0.05 million. His method of valuing the cryptocurrency in decimals underscores his belief in the asset’s upside.He had previously said, “If Bitcoin is not going to zero then it’s going to $1 million. If it’s a legitimate institutional asset then everybody is under-allocated to it.”Bitcoin came close to breaking its all-time high on Monday, following a rip above $71,000 for the first time in 7 weeks. The prize digital asset was up 15% over the week, and more than 9% over the month, as investors' risk appetite for cryptocurrencies rose sharply.Top analysts amped up their bullish expectations for the apex cryptocurrency following the launch of spot Bitcoin ETFs earlier this year. British multinational bank Standard Chartered forecasted a surge to $100,000 by the end of the year, and close to $200,000 by the end of 2025.These predictions appear conservative in comparison to former Twitter Boss' Jack Dorsey's belief in the cryptocurrency hitting $1 million by 2030 or Ark Invest CEO Cathie Wood's $2.3 million bet by 2030.Price Action: At the time of writing, Bitcoin was trading at $71,161.22, following a 7.60% increase in the last 24 hours, according to data from Benzinga Pro. MicroStrategy shares closed Monday's trading session 9% higher at $1,727.24.Read Next: SEC Chair Gary Gensler Mocked By Popular Crypto Analyst After Spot Ethereum ETF Progress: ‘His Meltdown Would Be Historic’Editor’s Note: The headline has been updated to correct the spelling of Michael Saylor’s name.

The Sharp Rise in Bitcoin and Ethereum Upset the Bears! 340 Million Dollars Evaporated! - Bitcoin Sistemi

This week has entered a critical week for Ethereum. While until yesterday it was more likely that the SEC would reject spot ETH ETFs, yesterday's news increased the possibility of approval.
Bloomberg senior ETF analysts stated that they revised the approval probability, which they had previously announced as 25 percent, to 75 percent, based on their X accounts.


This positive news from the USA was met with great enthusiasm in the cryptocurrency market, and there were significant increases in altcoins, especially Ethereum and Bitcoin.
First of all, due to the impact of the news, ETH experienced an impressive rise of more than 18% in the last 24 hours and reached $ 3,670.





BTC, on the other hand, rose above $ 70,000 again with a 6.2% increase and reached $ 71,240.
This rising wave initiated by the Ethereum ETF news also mobilized other altcoins besides ETH.


Accordingly, Lido DAO (LDO) ranks first with a 30% increase in the last 24 hours, while Pyth Network (PYTH) ranks second with a 25% increase; Bonk (BONK) ranked third with its 19% increase.
Ethena (ENA) 19.25%; Pendle (PENDLE) 18.4%; Arbitrum (ARB) 17.17%; Ethereum Classic (ETC) increased by 12.9%.






After the Sharp Rise in Bitcoin and Ethereum, $340 Million Evaporated!
While there were sharp increases in Bitcoin, Ethereum and altcoins, investors in short positions were left in reverse and liquidated.
At this point, according to data from CoinGlass, $340 million was liquidated in crypto futures in the last 24 hours. Of this, $263 million consisted of short positions and $77 million consisted of long positions.

Additionally, while 78,928 investors were liquidated in the last 24 hours, the largest liquidation took place in the ETH-USDT transaction on the Huobi exchange.
The largest liquidation occurred in ETH with $115 million, followed by Bitcoin with $99.9 million.

Why Is The Crypto Market Up Today?


The total crypto market cap observed rose massively over the last 24 hours, along with Bitcoin’s price inching closer to breaching the all-time high. Amid this rally, Lido DAO surprised its investors by registering 30% gains in 24 hours. This is likely due to the changing landscape of Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs.
In the news today:-

Gala Games exploited and hacker mints 5 billion GALA tokens worth $214 million. Proceeds to sell 592 million GALA worth $21.8 million before being blacklisted.
Ethereum outperforms Mastercard regarding market capitalization, with the former reaching $437 billion compared to the latter’s $427 billion.

The Total Market Cap Crosses Significant Milestones

The total market cap crossed the $2.50 trillion mark yesterday following bullishness from investors. The rise was driven by the surge in spot Bitcoin ETF inflows over the past week and the potential approval of spot Ethereum ETFs. 
The past 24 hours recorded more than $237 million in inflows, including $9.4 million observed by Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC).

This has propelled TOTAL to a $2.53 trillion market cap, marking a monthly high.

However, it is testing the support at $2.52 trillion, and a drop below it could cause a potential decline to $2.4 trillion.

Bitcoin Price Is Close to an All-Time High
Bitcoin’s price, currently at $71,000, is close to breaching $73,650 and forming a new all-time high above this price. The crypto asset shot up by more than 7% in the span of a day, rising from $66,000.
The crypto asset has followed the target pattern established by the flag pattern for the past three and a half months. If BTC manages to flip the resistance at $71,800 into support, it could establish a new all-time high before the end of the week.

But if the breach fails, it could trickle back down to $68,500 to test it as a support floor, as it has been multiple times in the past.
Lido DAO Takes the Top Spot
Along with Bitcoin and other top crypto assets, Lido DAO’s price rallied and emerged as the best-performing asset of the day. Within 24 hours, LDO gained nearly 30%, bringing the trading price to $2.28 from $1.7.
Closing above the support at $2.20 will enable LDO to attempt an escape from the ongoing death cross. This would be confirmed once the 50-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA) crosses over the 200-day EMA.

On the other hand, if the support of $2.20 is broken, the altcoin could fall to $2.00 or $1.85. Consequently, the bullish thesis would be invalidated, and the recent gains would also be lost.

                        The American Bankers Association (ABA) on Monday urged House leaders to back a bill that would stop the Federal Reserve from creating a CBDC for individuals and using it for monetary policy tools.Congressman Tom Emmer (R-Minn.) introduced the CBDC Anti-Surveillance State Act (H.R. 5403) in Sept. 2023. The bill, which has gained support from 165 cosponsors, is expected to be voted on this week.“ABA believes strongly that a CBDC, defined as a digital form of central bank money that is widely available to the general public, is unnecessary in the United States and would present unacceptable risks and costs to the financial system,” the association said in the letter to Speaker Mike Johnson and Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries.“The dollar is already digital today, and it is unclear how issuing a CBDC would improve financial inclusion or achieve other laudable goals,” it added.
Fed Studying CBDC Despite Reservations from Top Officials
The ABA’s letter also warned that a CBDC would disrupt the current financial system in several ways. It could fundamentally alter the relationship between citizens and the Federal Reserve, weaken the role of banks, worsen economic downturns, and make it harder for the Fed to manage the economy effectively, the letter said.While the US hasn’t launched a CBDC yet, the government has shown interest in digital currency. The New York Fed’s 12-week pilot program testing a simulated digital dollar is just one example of these ongoing initiatives.Fed officials, including Chair Jerome Powell and Governor Michelle Bowman, might be hesitant about a digital dollar. But that hasn’t stopped the Fed from actively researching its potential.
ABA Warns of Crippling Impact on Banks
Further, the Fed launching the FedNow Service for instant payments in October has some experts on edge. They worry it could be the building block for a future CBDC.According to the ABA, a CBDC would do more harm than good. The association fears it would siphon money away from banks and into the Fed, crippling banks’ ability to lend and hindering economic growth across the country. In simpler terms, the ABA sees a CBDC as a powerful competitor that could steal deposits from banks, making it harder for them to provide loans that fuel local economies.

Experts Forecast Crypto Regulation Pivot By Joe Biden


								The Biden administration may be preparing for a strategic pivot on crypto regulations, potentially aligning closer with the digital asset community ahead of the upcoming November election. This speculation follows recent developments indicating a possible approval of a spot Ether ETF, a significant change in stance by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).
On Thursday, Bloomberg ETF analysts James Seyffart and Eric Balchunas dramatically increased their forecast for the approval of a spot Ether ETF from 25% to 75%, citing sources close to the SEC. The analysts reported a sudden change in sentiment within the SEC, possibly reflecting a broader political recalibration by the Biden administration in response to former President Donald Trump’s endorsement of Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies.
This news has sent shockwaves through the financial and crypto markets, with Ethereum and other altcoin prices experiencing double-digit surges. Notably, the approval process requires the SEC to green-light both the 19b-4s, which involves exchange rule changes, and S-1s, the registration statements needed for ETFs to launch. This move is seen as the first concrete sign of the Biden administration‘s reorientation towards a more crypto-friendly policy framework.
Crypto Community Speculates On 180-Degree U-Turn
Following the news, several experts came forward, speculating on a complete turnaround from the Biden administration. Haseeb Qureshi, Managing Partner at Dragonfly, stated via X: “Been saying for weeks that Biden is going to soften on crypto going into the election. He doesn’t want to lose votes in a tight race over what is ultimately a minor issue to him. ETF is the first sign of this—I think we see other agencies also softening in the next few months.”.

This sentiment suggests a tactical adjustment rather than a full policy overhaul, aimed at mitigating political risks rather than championing digital currencies.
Sam Lyman, Director of Public Policy at Riot Platforms, highlighted a series of crypto-friendly shifts, including Trump’s overt support for digital assets, the SEC’s policy reversal on the Ether ETF, and significant legislative developments.
Lyman provided a list of recent victories for the crypto sector, such as the repeal of SAB 121 and the resignation of the FDIC Chair, seen as a result of political pressures from pro-crypto factions.


Jake Chervinsky, Chief Legal Officer at Variant Fund, commented on the potential implications of the ETF approval beyond its market impact. “If the spot ETH ETF is approved, it will be a true shock to everyone I know in DC who’s close to this process. That doesn’t mean it won’t happen. It means approval could signal a major shift in US crypto policy after the SAB 121 vote, perhaps more important than the ETF itself,” Chervinsky explained.
Vijay Boyapati and Adam Cochran both agreed with Chervinsky. Boyapati, a renowned crypto expert, pointed out the political calculations at play, suggesting the Democrats were recalibrating their stance to mitigate electoral losses.

“The abrupt about-face by the SEC on the Ethereum ETF approval is nakedly political. The Democrats have seen that their hostility could potentially cost them the election and Biden likely commandeered the SEC to be more friendly despite the [Senator] Warren wing of the party,” Boyapati remarked.
Cochran, partner at CEHV, expanded on this, indicating a broader realization within the Democratic Party that a pro-crypto stance could appeal to a wider voter base, including moderates and independents focused on financial policies.
He remarked via X:
Warren had a strangle hold over financial policy under the Dems. This is showing the WH and Senate Dems are starting to realize that’s toxic to their election odds. […] This is a big and rapid shift in crypto policy, […] If that’s accurate, it’s more important than the ETF itself. It could mean the winter is over and it’s time for a US renaissance in crypto!
At press time, ETH traded at $3,659, up 18% within the last 24 hours.

Cream Finance crypto Jumps 65%: Is it the new hot pick? - AMBCrypto



CREAM’s trading volume surged by 378.65% in 24 hours and drove the price near $75.
Almost all the holders of the crypto are whales but Cream Finance’s TVL has been underwhelming.

CREAM, the native token of Cream Finance, a DeFi protocol, has taken the crypto market unaware as its price rallied by 65.25% in the last seven days. This surge came at a time when the prices of most cryptocurrencies were either shrinking or consolidating.
At press time, CREAM’s price was $72.25 with a market cap of $133.40 million. However, Cream Finance’s reach in the market seems limited considering that the crypto is not a part of the top 100.
For those unfamiliar, AMBCrypto explains what the project entails in this article.
What is Cream Finance?
Cream Finance is a part of the yearn.finance [YFI] ecosystem. However, Cream does not just work as a lending protocol for individuals. Instead, it also allows institutions and other protocols to access liquidity on its network.
Cream Finance is a permissionless and open-source network and works for users on the Binance Smart Chain, Ethereum, Polygon, and Fantom blockchains.
Not many know this but CREAM came to life after a hard fork of Compound Finance [COMP] in 2020. In crypto, a hard fork is a change to the protocol of a blockchain’s network.
When this happens, previous blocks become invalid as well as transactions. Furthermore, users and nodes upgrade to the latest version to remain compatible with the upgrade.
Sometimes, a hard fork comes with a new token. Sometimes, it does not. For Cream Finance the 2020 split brought about the development of the CREAM cryptocurrency.
With CREAM, users can stake, lend, and borrow assets on the network. However, the token is not the only asset that can be used on the network. Cryptos like COMP, ETH, YFI, some stablecoins, and a few other tokens can interact with Cream Finance.
“This group” is driving the price higher
As per the recent price increase, AMBCrypto noticed that Cream Finance did not announce any major developments. However, using IntoTheBlock’s data, we observed that there was an increase in the activity of whales.
Whales own a greater dollar amount of a cryptocurrency. Most times, the tokens held by this cohort represent 1% of the total circulating supply.
According to press time data, about 94.74% of CREAM holders are whales. Out of this group, 19.42% of them engaged in 1,362 transactions in the last 24 hours.
Source: IntoTheBlock
This number is considered high whale activity and is enough to move prices significantly. As such, it seemed the reason Cream Finance has outperformed other projects was because of high whale activity.
Confirmation of this increase appeared in the trading volume. As of this writing, CREAM’s volume has increased by 378.65% in the last 24 hours.
On the 19th of May, the volume surpassed $100 million according to Santiment’s data. With this volume, CREAM’s price was closed in on $75.
Moments later, the price decreased indicating that some holders of the token were booking profits. Though the volume had slightly fallen from this point, it might not be enough to force a double-digit correction.
Source: Santiment
If the volume continues to rise while the price increases, CREAM could drive another 15% increase that could take the price to $83.95.
However, a decline in volume could mean waning strength for the token. In this case, the price could fall to $53.59 which was another area of interest.
Is CREAM dependable?
Despite the mind-blowing price increase, the Total Value Locked (TVL) indicated a bearish signal. TVL is an indicator of a protocol’s health.
If the metric increases, it means that market participants are depositing assets into the ecosystem. When the TVL falls, it indicates a surge in withdrawals.
In this instance, it could mean that participants no longer trust the system to provide good yield. According to AMBCrypto’s analysis using DeFiLlama, Cream Finance’s TVL was more than $ 2 billion in 2021.
Source: DeFiLlama
But after a Flash Loan attack in 2021, the metric has become a shadow of its former self. For context, a Flash Loan attack happens when capitalizes on a flaw in a protocol and takes out uncollateralized loans from a lending protocol.

Realistic or not, here’s CREAM’s market cap in ETH terms

The attackers, in question, use this to manipulate the market while stealing assets owned by depositors. This ugly side of DeFi was what Cream Finance experienced such that its TVL was a little over $15 million at press time.
While the TVL might not necessarily influence the crypto price, it serves as a sign that users are wary of interacting with the protocol.

Hex Trust launches USDX stablecoin on Flare, offering real-world yields through clearpool partnership


    Hex Trust Group, a leading digital asset custodian with billions in assets under management, has unveiled USDX, the first native stablecoin for the Flare blockchain, according to the information shared with Finbold on May 21. 



USDX, pegged 1:1 to the US dollar, debuts with a Clearpool vault, allowing holders to earn real-world yields.



USDX, the critical DeFI asset on Flare



USDX is a product of HT Digital Assets, Hex Trust’s tokenization ecosystem, and serves as the key decentralized finance (DeFi) asset on Flare. 







Its value is backed by US dollar equivalents, primarily 1–3 month Treasury Bills, securely held by regulated tier-1 financial institutions, ensuring reliability and trustworthiness.



The stablecoin is set to play a foundational role in Flare’s emerging DeFi and bridging ecosystem, being utilized across various applications, including lending and borrowing protocols and perpetual futures exchanges. 



Staking USDX



Users can also stake USDX in a dedicated T-Pool created by Clearpool, offering them real-world yield opportunities. 



Staking has no lock-up periods, so users can maximize returns through both base yield and bonus FLR incentives. 



Staking USDX on Clearpool yields cUSDX, which can be used as collateral in Flare Labs’ FAsset system, integrating non-smart contract assets like Bitcoin (BTC) and Dogecoin (DOGE) into Flare’s DeFi ecosystem.



The importance of stablecoins in DeFi



Hugo Philion, Co-Founder of Flare, emphasized the importance of stablecoins in building a vibrant DeFi ecosystem, stating: 




“Stablecoins are fundamental for the development of a vibrant DeFi ecosystem. The collaboration between USDX and Clearpool on Flare delivers a 1:1 backed stable asset with immediate access to real world yield. This will be particularly useful for FAsset agents, putting their stable collateral to work even while it’s locked in the system.”




Alessio Quaglini, CEO & Co-Founder of Hex Trust, likewise described the launch of USDX on Flare as a significant milestone. 



Quaglini noted that USDX bridges traditional financial security and blockchain innovation, promising reduced market volatility, streamlined transactions, and enhanced trust within the digital asset ecosystem.



Democratizing yield from stable holdings



Jakob Kronbichler, CEO & Co-Founder of Clearpool, highlighted Clearpool’s position as a leading borrowing and lending platform on Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM)-compatible chains, stating:




“Clearpool is the leading borrowing and lending Dapp active on the top EVM-compatible chains. Launching a custom T-Pool for USDX on Flare is great for both everyday users who want to earn a real world yield from their stable holdings, and for FAssets agents who can earn additional yield for their USDX while it’s collateralized in the system.”




The introduction of USDX on Flare is expected to reduce crypto market volatility, streamline transactions, and enhance overall security. 



As more Flare-native projects adopt USDX, its utility will expand, offering new opportunities for users to earn returns on their digital assets.

"The collaboration between USDX and Clearpool on Flare delivers a 1:1 backed stable asset with immediate access to real world yield," Flare's co-founder Hugo Philion said. "This will be particularly useful for FAsset agents, putting their stable collateral to work even while it's locked in the system.”

Yuga Labs discontinues CryptoPunks amid backlash over 'woke' collection - CoinJournal



                    

                    
Yuga Labs faces backlash over its new Super Punk World collection.
The Super Punk World collection pays homage to the irreverent, early-internet roots of CryptoPunks.
Yuga Labs’ decision focuses on preservation and education rather than active development.

Yuga Labs, the NFT giant behind the iconic CryptoPunks, has announced it will cease any further development on the project following intense community backlash over its new Super Punk World collection.
The decision came after fervent criticism from the crypto community, accusing Yuga Labs of compromising the original essence of CryptoPunks with what some described as a “woke” initiative.
The Super Punk World collection
On May 20, the official CryptoPunks account launched the Super Punk World collection, featuring 500 pieces of hybridized 3D sculptures.
These pieces, created by New York-based painter Nina Abney, were designed to pay homage to the irreverent, early-internet roots of CryptoPunks while addressing themes of race and gender.
 The backlash against Super Punk World collection
However, despite the artistic intentions, the collection quickly faced a storm of criticism.
One community member bluntly declared, “Yuga killed Punks today,” echoing the sentiment that the project had strayed too far from its original ethos.
The backlash included threats from NFT holders to sell their CryptoPunk assets, and sarcastic comments questioning if the official account had been hacked. A prominent NFT trader even urged the community to boycott Yuga Labs and move forward without them.
Yuga Labs’ response
In response to the uproar, Yuga Labs CEO Greg Solano issued a statement on X clarifying that the team’s vision was to bridge Web3 with the traditional art world by collaborating with esteemed artists like Abney.
Solano noted that despite the backlash, the goal was to connect with those already supporting Abney’s work, possibly by airdropping the new collection to holders of her previous works, such as SuperCoolWorld.
Addressing the future of CryptoPunks, Solano announced that Yuga Labs would no longer be involved in the project’s development.
“What about punks? Yuga will no longer touch punks. They will just be decentralized and preserved on the blockchain,” he stated.
The CEO went further and emphasized that Yuga’s focus would shift to supporting museums and institutions in acquiring CryptoPunk NFTs and educating the public about their significance.
However, despite the controversy, the CryptoPunks collection has demonstrated resilience.
In March, two record-breaking sales highlighted the enduring value of these digital assets. On March 4, a rare alien CryptoPunk sold for 4,500 Ether (approximately $16 million), followed by another sale on March 20 for 4,850 Ether (around $16.4 million).

Ethereum Founder Vitalik Buterin Received a Proposal for Layer 2 Transfers! Here are the Details - Bitcoin Sistemi

Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin has called for the development of an open, decentralized protocol that will facilitate the rapid transfer of assets between Layer 2 (L2) solutions.
Vitalik Buterin Advocates Decentralized Protocol to Improve Layer 2 Asset Transfers
In a statement, Buterin emphasized the need for a protocol that works without operators or management, providing a seamless and efficient user experience.


Buterin proposed that such a protocol be integrated into wallets' default sending interfaces and enable a variety of transactions, including token transfers, Ethereum Name Service (ENS) transactions, and key changes for both personal and enterprise smart contract wallets.
This integration aims to simplify the process of moving assets between different L2 networks, which are increasingly adopted due to their scalability and lower transaction costs compared to the Ethereum mainnet.





“An open, decentralized (operator-less, management-free) protocol to quickly move assets from one L2 to another is essential. This will greatly increase the functionality and usability of Layer 2 solutions and make them more accessible to everyday users,” Buterin said.
Buterin also highlighted the success of ENS as a prime example of a non-financial application of blockchain technology.



ENS, which allows users to register and manage human-readable names for Ethereum addresses and decentralized websites, has seen significant adoption and integration across various platforms.
“ENS is the most successful non-financial application of blockchain,” said Buterin, underlining its impact and potential for broader use cases beyond financial transactions.





The push for a decentralized asset transfer protocol reflects ongoing efforts within the Ethereum community to improve interoperability and user experience across different blockchain layers.
As Layer 2 solutions continue to evolve, such innovations are expected to play a key role in driving the next phase of blockchain adoption and development.

Crypto Markets Add $200B Overnight as BTC, ETH Soar to 6-Week Highs (Market Watch)


																After a few days of trading sideways at around $67,000, bitcoin went on the offensive hard yesterday, jumping by several grand to a multi-week peak of $72,000.
The altcoins’ rally was led by Ethereum, which skyrocketed by approximately 20% at one point amid reemerging hopes about the US SEC approving ETH ETFs soon.
BTC Reclaims $72K
The ever-volatile crypto market can change a lot in the span of a week and this is exactly what transpired in the past seven days. Just last Tuesday, the primary cryptocurrency failed to overcome $63,000 and slipped back down to $61,000.
However, it started surging in value once the US CPI numbers came out on Wednesday and shot up to around $67,000. After a few more fluctuations around that level, the asset calmed during the weekend and stood primarily in a range between $66,000 and $67,000.
Monday also started on a calm note, but the landscape changed during the evening US trading session, and BTC exploded out of the gate. In a matter of hours, the cryptocurrency skyrocketed by about five grand and charted a 6-week high of $72,000.


Thanks for subscribing, you will get your first report in the next hours!


Despite retracing since then, BTC still stands above $70,000, being 6% up on the day. Its market cap has tapped $1.4 trillion, but its dominance over the alts has been reduced to under 51%.

ETH’s Show
The news that sent the entire crypto market flying was related to Ethereum and the eventual approval of spot ETFs in the States. Naturally, the underlying asset gained the most. ETH shot up by 20% at one point from around $3,100 to over $3,700, which became its highest price tag since April 9.
Binance Coin, Ripple, Toncoin, Dogecoin, Cardano, Shiba Inu, Polkadot, and Bitcoin Cash are also well in the green, with gains of up to 8%. Avalanche is the other double-digit gainer from the larger-cap alts.
The total crypto market cap added approximately $200 billion in a day. The metric is now up to $2.750 trillion.

BitFuFu’s Net Income Soars 13X in Q1 2024: Here’s Why


BitFuFu, a leading digital asset mining service provider, announced a substantial increase in its net income for the first quarter of 2024. The company’s net income soared to $35.3 million, up from just $2.7 million in the same period last year, marking a significant 13-fold increase.
BitFuFu is not the only crypto miner to record stellar performance in the first quarter of 2024. Various other crypto-mining companies also achieved remarkable growth in the same period.
BitFuFu Stock Underperforms Despite Positive Q1 Reports

BitFuFu credits this growth to its strategic cloud-mining solutions and robust Bitcoin self-mining operations. Total revenue for the quarter reached $144.4 million, a 149% increase from the previous year’s $58.0 million. 
Moreover, cloud-mining revenue, which surged to $81.5 million, up 181% from the prior year, was a considerable part of this growth.
The company’s Bitcoin self-mining operation revenues reached $60.1 million, up 117% from last year. This was facilitated by optimized mining operations and favorable market conditions, although a higher mining difficulty slightly impacted overall Bitcoin output.

Leo Lu, CEO and Chairman of BitFuFu commented on the results, emphasizing the benefits of their business model. 

“Our cloud-mining solutions allow us to reduce revenue volatility created by sharp swings in digital asset prices and significantly strengthen cash flow by pre-selling hashrate at a fixed price that can be invested in expanding our business,” Lu said.

Regarding operational costs, the cost of revenue climbed to $122.7 million, representing a 120.7% increase. This rise was primarily due to expanded operations in cloud-mining and self-mining.
The company’s EBITDA also showed positive trends, with adjusted figures reflecting a 430.9% increase to $49.9 million. This includes an $11.8 million unrealized gain on Bitcoin, attributed to the early adoption of new accounting rules for digital assets.
Despite these strong financial outcomes, BitFuFu’s stock experienced a decline of over 6% on May 20, 2024, with a significant year-to-date drop of over 60%.

BitFuFu’s Q1 2024 report aligns with the broader industry trend. Notably, other crypto miners like Core Scientific have also reported strong performances. 
Core Scientific rebounded from bankruptcy, reporting a net income of $210.7 million in the first quarter of 2024. Its recovery was largely due to a strategic overhaul of operations and financial management, which included significant gains from extinguishing pre-emergence obligations.

Marathon Digital also showcased impressive results in the same period, with revenues soaring by 223% year-over-year to $165.2 million. Its net income increased by 184% to $337.2 million, bolstered by efficient operational advancements and increased Bitcoin mined.

Bieber, Fallon, Trump: Detailed Look at Their Crypto Portfolios


Arkham Intelligence data has exposed the crypto portfolios of some of the world’s most well-known figures: Justin Bieber, Jimmy Fallon, and Donald Trump.
The surprising findings offer a glimpse into these celebrities’ digital investments, revealing substantial holdings and intriguing transactions.
Crypto Portfolios of Bieber, Fallon, and Trump: What’s Inside?

According to Arkham Intelligence data, pop icon Justin Bieber has a crypto net worth of $556,890. His top holding is Ethereum (ETH), worth approximately $536,080.
Other notable Bieber holdings include ApeCoin (APE) and Dione (DIONE). He owns 12,136 APE and 301,027 DIONE.
His DIONE holding is particularly interesting, given it is an altcoin with a relatively small market capitalization of $148.69 million today. According to the on-chain data, his DIONE tokens came from an address labeled “an OpenSea user (0x6A2)” through Uniswap V2 Pool. His last active transaction in the wallet was buying an Otherside NFT for $20,000 on Opensea on May 1, 2022.

Bieber made headlines in Web3 when he purchased a Bored Ape Yacht Club non-fungible token (NFT) collectible. In January 2022, he bought Bored Ape #3001 for 500 ETH, worth approximately $1.3 million. However, at the time of writing, Bieber’s NFT is valued at 12.06 ETH, which translates to $44,259.
The dashboard further reveals that Donald Trump, an entrepreneur and former US president, has a crypto net worth of $8.3 million. His top holding is a MAGA (TRUMP) meme coin worth roughly $4.5 million.
Other notable Trump holdings include 434,341 ETH ($1.59 million) and 374,772 Wrapped Ether (WETH), valued at $1.37 million. His last active transaction in the wallet was sending 250 ETH to the crypto exchange Coinbase on December 28, 2023.

Trump recently made headlines after publicly announcing that he would accept crypto donations for his presidential campaign. BeInCrypto reported that during a special event for holders of his “Mugshot Edition” NFTs in Florida earlier this month, Trump also expressed his comfort with crypto.

“And if you like crypto, […] if you’re in favor of crypto, you better vote for Trump,” he said.


Trump’s positive stance towards the industry also sparked the resurgence of political-themed meme coins, particularly ones related to him. In early May, the top 50 meme coins saw a collective market cap increase by over 10%. During the period, TRUMP, TurboToadToken (TURBO), and Ponke (PONKE) went up by 12%, leading the charge.
Meanwhile, Jimmy Fallon, an American host known for Saturday Night Live and The Tonight Show, has a crypto net worth of $181,097. His top holding is Ethereum, worth approximately $124,820. Besides Ethereum, Fallon’s noteworthy holdings include 10.09 million APE. His last active transaction in the wallet was claiming an Otherside NFT around two years ago, on May 16, 2022.

Fallon was known as one of the public figures who tapped early into the NFT space through his BAYC acquisition. However, in late 2022, Fallon, Bieber, and other Hollywood celebrities sued in a class action suit for engaging in “insidious marketing and promotional activities […] to increase demand” for BAYC NFTs.
Bieber, Trump, and Fallon are just a few public figures holding cryptocurrencies and NFTs. Other names include rapper Snoop Dogg and Brazilian footballer Neymar, who are also known for their significant investments in crypto.

Ethereum Still Above $3,600 as ETF Approval Hopes Swell - Decrypt

We do the research, you get the alpha!Get exclusive reports and access to key insights on airdrops, NFTs, and more! Subscribe now to Alpha Reports and up your game!Go to Alpha ReportsEthereum took a big leap last night and early this morning on reports that the Securities and Exchange Commission has asked spot ETF applicants to submit revised 19b-4 filings.The 19b-4 filings are what firms use to propose rule changes to the SEC. In this case, applicants would need the regulator to change their rules to allow for Ethereum spot ETFs to trade on exchanges.When this happened for spot Bitcoin ETF applicants in January, the industry was just days away from an historical approval of all 11 spot Bitcoin ETFs. There's no guarantee, of course, that things will play out quite the same as they did then. But sentiment around this week's upcoming deadline has taken a big swing and sent ripples throughout the market.At the time of writing, the Ethereum price is holding above $3,600 and has seen volumes increase 219% in the past 24 hours, according to Coinglass.Stablecoin Open Dollar founder Joseph Schiarizzi noted on Twitter last night that Ethereum increased its market capitalization—now $439 billion—in 3 minutes by as much as half that of Ethereum competitor Solana.Delegate Labs and Clusters founder Foobar noted on Twitter that the spike in price had created the largest ETHUSD daily candle in history as the price went from $3,070 to $3,661.Meanwhile the open interest, or open ETH futures contracts, has swelled 26% in the past day to $15 billion. And call options—which are opened by optimistic traders who think the price of an asset is going to increase—outnumber put options almost 2:1, according to Coinglass.There's now $3 billion worth of open interest in Ethereum options that expire at the end of May and June.The potential approval, or at least a step towards it, has gotten analysts wondering how the SEC could grant an approval while also fighting court battles over ETH's status as a security."If the speculation about a 180 from SEC on the Ethereum ETFs is true, I would guess they try to thread a needle between 'ETH' NOT being a security and 'staked ETH' (or even more flimsily, 'staking as a service ETH') as BEING a security," wrote Alex Thorn, head of research at Galaxy Digital, wrote on Twitter.Just a month ago, Ethereum software giant Consensys filed a lawsuit against the SEC over its attempts to regulate ETH like a security. It was only a few weeks ago that court filings from that lawsuit revealed that a leaked internal memo from the SEC showed that the regulator has considered Ethereum to be a security for more than a year.If the SEC does approve spot Ethereum ETFs to begin trading, Singapore trading firm QCP Capital predicts ETH could quickly close the gap to $4,000 and rise as high as $5,000 before the end of the year."⁠If not approved, we could expect an ugly move back to 3k," the firm wrote in a blog post. "This uncertainty has resulted in higher volatility, but the better trade might be spot-futures basis which is now yielding above 10% again."(Disclosure: Consensys is one of 22 investors in Decrypt)Daily Debrief NewsletterStart every day with the top news stories right now, plus original features, a podcast, videos and more.

CryptoPunks face backlash while DMarket leads NFT sales


The top-ranking non-fungible token collection for Monday was DMarket, which recorded sales of US$742,104, with 4,016 unique buyers and 3,648 sellers engaging in 34,740 transactions. 



The second-ranking collection of the day, Fantasy Top, experienced a big daily sales dip to US$682,369 from the previous day’s US$1.80 million, according to CryptoSlam’s NFT rankings.



NodeMonkes claimed the third spot in the daily rankings, with sales amounting to US$642,517, a rise from the previous Sunday’s US$274,929. The collection attracted 33 unique buyers and 27 sellers, resulting in 34 total transactions.



However, the day’s hot development came from CryptoPunks, which recorded US$636,242 in sales at fourth place.

	
	
	
	


CryptoPunks under Yuga Labs, the firm that acquired the collection’s IP in 2022, announced its new Super Punk World NFTs that “blur the lines of race & gender and reflect upon virtual versus real world identities.”



However, the new collection quickly received heavy backlash from community members.



Certain members critiqued the artistic approach while others have sparked controversy by labeling it as “woke” because of its focus on race and gender.



“Yuga will no longer touch punks,” said Greg Solano, the firm’s chief executive, responding to the public backlash. “They will just be decentralized and preserved on the blockchain.”

	
	
	

	


Bored Ape Yacht Club, Yuga Labs’ flagship collection, followed CryptoPunks at fifth with US$502,064.



Both collections are part of the Ethereum blockchain, which reported a total daily sales volume of over US$6.35 million to lead all chains on Monday.

Ethereum ETF approval likelihood increases with SEC's positive signals


The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) appears to be leaning towards approving spot Ether exchange-traded funds (ETFs), prompting a surge in Ether’s value.



Ether traded as high as US$3,710 in the past 24 hours, according to CoinGecko.



Bloomberg analysts Eric Balchunas and James Seyffart have revised their approval probability from 25% to 75%, citing a rise in discussions about expedited 19b-4 filings, a critical step for ETF launches. 



This potential regulatory shift has not only elevated Ether’s price but also spurred a wider market rally, with Bitcoin trading above US$70,000 for the first time since April.

	
	
	
	


The price jump and market optimism coincide with the SEC’s upcoming deadline to rule on VanEck’s spot Ether ETF application by May 23. 



While the market reacts positively, Seyffart warns that the necessary S-1 registration statements could still face delays. 



The SEC’s evolving stance is influenced by expectations of a potential shift in crypto policies, including a recent cryptocurrency-supportive legislation.

Drop Hunting on CryptoRank: The Best Airdrop Guides at One Place | Bitcoinist.com


								Recently we released a new product dedicated to airdrops, Drop Hunting, and in this article we want to familiarize you with its functionality. This tool is now available to every CryptoRank user. With it, airdrop hunting will become more advanced, efficient and simple.
Airdrop mania has taken over minds and now literally everyone is doing it: from cab drivers to bank employees. Noticing the need for clear and structured information on drop hunting, we decided to create a product that will cover all activities, as well as be easy to use and have wide functionality.
Overview
While on the CryptoRank homepage, you can click on the “Products –> Drop Hunting” tab, which will take you to the dashboard page.

The dashboard can be divided into two components:

Overview widgets located in the first half of the page;
A list of all current projects with airdrop campaigns, located below the widget;

Let’s take a detailed look at both components of the page.
Widgets – All the Most Important Information in One Place
The overview widget is three scoreboards that show:

Current Activity Overview, including quantitative analytics on:

Number of new campaigns added during the week.
Number of projects with confirmed airdrop.
Number of airdrops which can already be claimed.
The average amount of airdrop per account.


Near-term rewards, which includes projects that are expected to go live distribute airdrop soon, or have already opened claim page.
Hot activity – projects that are directly worth being active in.

All Airdrops in One Place
Right below the widgets is a list of all current projects in which you can be active. Let’s take a closer look at this block. In the upper part there is a panel of filters by various criteria, after which the list of projects starts.

The list includes the name of the project, types of task and potential rewards, status, the amount of money raised from venture capital funds, and the Twitter (X) account score of the project. With all these metrics, you will be able to select the most relevant project with the highest potential.
However, one of the most important metrics is “Project Status Update”. It indicates the stage of the project, i.e. it ultimately helps users answer the question, “is it still worthwhile to participate or is it too late?”.

The statuses are categorized into:

Potential means that airdrop from the project is not confirmed, but is very likely.
Confirmed means that airdrop has been confirmed by the project.
Snapshot means that a project has already taken a snapshot, so it is too late to take active actions.
Verification means that a project has launched a website where you can check if you are eligible.
Reward available means that the claims page has been launched and you can click on the link to get the airdrop.
Distributed means that the claiming period is over or the airdrop has already been distributed automatically.

The second metric to look at is “Reward Type”.

Types are categorized into:

Airdrop, a distribution of project tokens to users who have performed certain activities.
Ambassador, a role in the project, in which the user must perform certain marketing tasks aimed at the development of the project, for which he will then be rewarded.
Whitelist, activity for which users can get on a list that gives them an opportunity to participate in a future closed token sale or a similar event from the project.
NFT stands for a distribution of non-fungible tokens, which are given for certain merits and can potentially become a multiplier in a future airdrop.
Points, a recently introduced type of airdrop, in which project tokens are distributed among users according to the number of accumulated points.
Role, a role on the project’s discord server, which is given for certain merits and can potentially become a multiplier for a future airdrop.

If you are a beginner, it is better to choose “Airdrop” and/or “Points” among this list to guarantee your reward. Using filters, you will simplify your research and save your time.
The Drophunter’s Main Assistant – Detailed Guide from CryptoRank
In addition to the sections described above, we also make detailed guides for all the projects in the list, as far as possible. To view a detailed guide, just click on the project you are interested in and you will be taken to its page.

The top part of the guide page repeats the project metrics from the previous page.
The bottom part is a detailed manual with detailed descriptions.
Note that in many projects it is better to perform several activities to have a better chance to get airdrop.

SEC takes surprising step towards approving spot Ether ETFs - Crypto Valley Journal

The US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has asked the partner exchanges of applicants for spot-based Ether Exchange Traded Funds (ETFs) to update their documentation. This is a first step toward an ETH ETF approval and a surprising change of position by the SEC.Since November 2023, BlackRock, Fidelity and other funds have been racing to launch the first spot-based ETF on Ether (ETH), the second largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization. Ideally, the applicants hope to replicate the overwhelming success of bitcoin ETFs. Over the past few weeks, the chances of approval by the upcoming May 23 deadline had steadily diminished due to a lack of communication between the SEC and the applicants, as well as a campaign by the SEC to classify Ether as a security. In a complete change of course, the SEC may now approve the spot Ether ETFs after all.Chances of ETF Approval Jump from 10% to 75%The first rumors of progress in the Ether ETF approval process first circulated on Twitter. Due to increased political pressure, the SEC supposedly suddenly changed course. Insiders confirmed the rumors to crypto media journal CoinDesk. Crypto exchanges have been asked by the SEC to update their 19b-4 filings on an expedited basis. However, this does not guarantee approval of the Ether ETFs. Product providers must first have their S-1 filings approved, for which there is no set deadline. But, the ball is rolling.Ether ETH/USD (daily) / Chart: TradingviewOn the prediction market Polymarket, traders had previously placed a 10% chance of approval, which immediately jumped to 70% after the rumors started circulating. Bloomberg ETF analysts Eric Balchunas and James Seyffart put the odds slightly higher at 75%. The Ether price immediately responded with a jump of +19.12%. The approval should become official in the coming days.Political pressure too highThe surprising turnaround may be due to new political pressure from the White House. A week ago, the U.S. Senate passed a resolution overturning the SEC's new accounting rules related to crypto custody at financial institutions. For the first time, the agency faced bipartisan opposition. Previously, the Democratic Party had been more critical of the sector, while Republicans have long criticized the SEC's apparent hostility to cryptocurrencies under Chairman Gary Gensler.Presidential candidate Donald Trump is using this situation in his campaign, publicly declaring himself "pro-crypto" and warning against SEC missteps. The Biden administration may backtrack before the election to avoid alienating crypto enthusiasts. It is estimated that 20% of all Americans hold digital assets. An unwarranted delay of the Ether ETFs would put the current president in an uncomfortable position.

Binance Launches Project Applicant Plan for Token Listings


Binance, announced a project applicant plan for the crypto listing, where it will give preference to “high-quality” projects. It admitted that there is a pattern of tokens being issued with high valuations and low initial floats.
Binance noted that there is concern in the community, as there are “little advantages” for traders from the rise of tokens with high valuations and low supply. It believes this trend will not decrease in the coming years; it is quite the opposite.
Binance Will Allow Only “Serious Projects” on Token Listings

Crypto exchange Binance pledged to help design a “healthy and sustainable” market that puts users’ interests first, not just companies seeking liquidity. 
Binance megadrop is the token issuance platform that integrates exchange coin-earning products with the web3 wallet. This allows users to be early adopters of web3 projects, even if they have not yet been launched on Binance.
Meanwhile, Binance Launchpad is a platform that supports aspiring projects for existing blockchains, triggering a paradigm shift in the cryptocurrency crowdfunding field.

The crypto exchange accused that some airdrops with diluted valuation and a low generation model are harmful because they generate “enormous” advantage pressure, affecting potential investors and members loyal to the project. Binance promised to “reshape that trend.”
The exchange estimated that $155 billion in tokens will be unlocked between 2024 and 2030, creating “selling pressure” due to the substantial amount of tokens entering the market.

“Binance is committed to providing value to users while safeguarding their interests. Supporting small and medium-sized crypto projects is one of the ways to reduce the market risk that has been observed from some sectors,” explained in his statement.


Binance seeks to finance projects in the industry by valuation (small and medium-sized companies), businesses, and products. Additionally, foundations (social commitment and community), and regulation and compliance.

Researchers noted that over 80% of the tokens listed on Binance have lost value in the last six months. Only 5 out of 31 listed tokens have seen price increases since their airdrop. These tokens – ORDI, Jupiter (JUP), Dogwifhat (WIF), Jito (JTO), and Memecoin (MEME) are meme coins or projects without significant venture capital backing.

Elon Musk Issues Important “Black Mirror” Statement to Warn Community


Serial tech entrepreneur Elon Musk, who runs X, Tesla, xAI and several other innovative companies, has taken to his own social media platform X (formerly famous as Twitter) to warn the global community about a clear possibility of “Black Mirror” TV series coming true in real life soon.Musk’s warning was about a new AI product announced by Microsoft – the patron of OpenAI which Musk sued earlier this year.Elon Musk's "Black Mirror" warningElon Musk has commented on the new AI feature presented by Microsoft. It is called “Recall.” This addition to the Windows operating system will constantly take screenshots on users’ computers to let them remember and quickly access everything they did on their computers in archives later.Elon Musk pointed out that this sounds like an episode from the TV series Black Mirror – the project was made to show likely dystopian scenarios of how technologies in the future may be used for controlling and ruling global population to wide TV audiences.Musk tweeted that he will definitely turn this Microsoft feature off. New Microsoft "Recall" feature described by CEO NadellaMicrosoft CEO Satya Nadella stated that Recall is a way to introduce photographic memories into users’ history. They will be able to do a semantic search in it if they want to recall what they did on the PCs at a certain point, on a certain day, in a particular month, year, etc, to “recreate moments from the past.” Then all this data will be processed with an AI to make it searchable. Musk saw another point here, though. The tech magnate perhaps implied that this data with screenshots can be easily accessed and used for controlling users’ actions and to see what exactly web pages they visited, to have a peek into their personal files, photos, correspondence, etc. In the conditions of strengthening authoritarian and totalitarian regimes around the world, this could become one of the perfect tools for controlling the population through constant surveillance of their PCs.Satya Nadella assures that this will be only done locally on users’ PC and that those who believe this feature could be dangerous and privacy interfering have nothing to worry about.

Gala Games $200M Exploit Was An 'Isolated Event,' Team Working Closely With Law Enforcement


																Web3 gaming project Gala Game was exploited by an unknown attacker, who was described as a compromised or rogue admin address, minted 5 Billion GALA, worth more than $200 million. The security incident has since been contained while the affected wallet has been frozen.
The team also said that the exploit was an isolated incident and law enforcement agencies have been roped in to identify the perpetrator.
‘Isolated Incident’
The exploit on Gala Games resulted in the unauthorized sale of 600 million of the tokens valued at $29 million worth at the time of the exploit via the decentralized exchange Uniswap. According to Solidity developer 0xquit, the attacker can create an additional 12 billion tokens before reaching the maximum limit.
However, the address that was exploited has been blocked, preventing further actions from that address. For the bad actor to mint or steal more tokens, they would need to gain access to a different administrator address.
Gala Games’ CEO Eric Schiermeyer took to X (formerly Twitter) to reveal that the exploit was identified within 45 minutes following which the team secured and removed unauthorized access to the GALA contract.




But this action did not stop the price of GALA from crashing almost 20% on May 21st from $0.048 to $0.039. The token has since stabilized.
Gala Games CEO Owns Up to Lapse
The exec admitted that Gala Games had failed to implement proper internal controls, leading to this unfortunate incident that should never have occurred. While Schiermeyer stated that the team believes they have identified the culprit behind the attack, they are now working closely with the FBI, Department of Justice, and international authorities to further investigate and address the matter.
Additionally, the CEO highlighted the pressing issue of the daily token distribution, stating that the community would decide through a node vote on how to proceed with handling this aspect.
“We messed up our internal controls…This shouldn’t have happened and we are taking steps to ensure it doesn’t ever again. We believe we have identified the culprit and we are currently working with the FBI, DOJ and a network of international authorities.”

Decrease of Bitcoin ATMs in the USA

In this month of May the number of Bitcoin ATMs in the USA has decreased. 
This is a real news, because it was in August of last year that they were constantly on the rise. 

The variations of Bitcoin ATMs in the USA
The peak number of Bitcoin ATMs in the USA occurred in August two years ago, when they exceeded 34,600. 
Starting from January 2023, however, there was a sharp decline, ending only in July of the same year when they had dropped below 26,900. 
Da notare che questo livello in realtà era ancora piuttosto alto, perchè sebbene dal picco dell’anno prima erano spariti più di 7.700 ATM Bitcoin, rimanevano comunque aumentati di ben 20.000 unità dall’inizio dell’ultima grande bullrun. 
Moreover, compared to 2019 they had almost increased tenfold. 
Therefore, the decline of 2023 was not actually particularly significant, so much so that still today more than 80% of these automatic teller machines in the world are concentrated on US soil. 
Starting from August 2023, however, there has been a sort of rebound, that is, Bitcoin ATMs in the USA had returned to grow. 
In the month of September alone, they increased by almost a thousand units, and the following month they still increased by more than 800. 
Insomma, nel giro di pochi mesi erano tornati ad essere più di 29.000, ed a marzo di quest’anno sono tornati anche sopra i 30.000. 
The recent drop in Bitcoin ATMs in the USA
This year, after four consecutive months of growth, in May just over 300 have been closed. 
It would almost seem like a reversal of trend, since in April they had increased by 470 units, and in March by more than 580 units. 
Overall, there are still more than 30,000 Bitcoin ATMs in the USA, but by the end of April they had also risen above 31,000 units. 
The causes of this decline are not precisely known, so it is not even possible to understand if it is a momentary decline or a real trend reversal. 
However, what is clear is that in the USA authorities have closed some of these automatic bullion machines because they were involved to varying degrees in fraudulent or illicit activities. However, it does not appear that any of the major Bitcoin ATM operators in the USA have had serious trouble with authorities, so it would seem to be only a temporary bearish trend. 
The rest of the world
Things, instead, are going differently in the rest of the world. 
Indeed, although in Canada the Bitcoin ATMs in May decreased by over 8 units, in Europe they increased by 4 units. 
It should be noted, however, that the USA and Canada control more than 90% of this market, so what happens in the rest of the world from this point of view remains marginal. 
Indeed, taking into account what is happening worldwide, in May the reduction was of 282 units, and this means that if in USA and Canada the overall reduction was of 310 units, in the rest of the world Bitcoin ATMs have increased by 28 units. 
At this moment 37,621 crypto ATMs are currently mapped around the world, with 30,960 in the USA, 2,989 in Canada, 1,624 in Europe, 1,047 in Spain, and the remaining 1,001 in the rest of the world. 
The decrease in May is therefore concentrated almost exclusively in USA and Canada, but comes after nine consecutive months of recovery. 
The crypto ATMs
Crypto ATMs are primarily used to buy and sell Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies in cash, that is, with paper bills. 
The fact is that they are the only safe way to carry out this type of cash trading, since obviously banknotes cannot be used on online exchanges, and other systems are not without risk. 
For this very reason, in many States the verification of identity for users of crypto ATM has been made mandatory, and this has led to a significant reduction in 2022/2023, as at that point several automatic machines were found to be non-compliant with the new rules. 
However, unlike what is commonly believed, these automatic teller machines are rarely used by users for speculative purposes. 
In fact, according to what the largest crypto ATM operator in the USA, Bitcoin Depot, has stated, the majority of their users use the ATMs for non-speculative purposes, such as money transfers, international remittances, and online purchases. 
After all, for those who have banknotes and want to send them abroad, crypto ATMs can be a very fast and effective solution, with costs that can be much lower than the classic alternatives. 
Those who speculate on cryptocurrencies prefer to use online exchanges, and above all digital money. 
This is also confirmed by the fact that the number of crypto ATMs from 2022 to date does not vary much with the fluctuation of the crypto market, because even though there was a decline in 2022, and a recovery in the second half of 2023, the variations in the number of crypto ATMs are minimal compared to the much broader fluctuations of the crypto markets.

Biden Wind in Ethereum ETFs! Did President Joe Biden Change His Mind? - Bitcoin Sistemi

Critical decision week has arrived for spot Ethereum ETFs. Until this week, market analysts, including Bloomberg ETF analysts, thought there was little chance the SEC would approve spot ETH ETFs.
Ethereum ETF Approval Possibility Increased!
However, the ETF pessimism that lasted for weeks suddenly changed yesterday and the probability of the SEC's approval of ETFs increased to 75% again.


Blommberg ETF analysts Eric Balchunas and James Seyffart think it is much higher in their posts.
“James Seyffart and I are raising our probability of spot Ethereum ETF approval to 75% (from 25% to 75%),” said Bloomberg Senior ETF Analyst Eric Balchunas.





Has Joe Biden's Cryptocurrency Policy Changed?
While there were sharp increases in altcoins along with Ethereum and Bitcoin (BTC) after these statements, it was evaluated that this change in spot ETH ETFs could be a clue to the change in US President Joe Biden's crypto policy.
Analysts claim that while there may not be a complete reversal on Biden's anti-crypto stance, the Biden administration will take a more conciliatory approach towards crypto to avoid alienating potential voters in what could be a very contentious election.


At this point, analysts evaluate that this sudden change in the approval status of ETH ETFs may be a reflection of the Biden government's policy change.
Speaking to The Block, Eric Balchunas said:






“Some of the political policy seems to have changed rapidly with the increasing likelihood of approvals on Spot Ethereum ETFs.
We see that cryptocurrencies in general are becoming a more politicized issue ahead of the upcoming presidential elections.
I'm not exactly sure, but President Joe Biden's administration may be trying to appear less stubborn about cryptocurrencies.
“In contrast, rejecting Ethereum ETFs could further fuel the notion that the current president and his administration are anti-crypto.”

Among a series of spot Ethereum ETF applications filed with the SEC, VanEck is first in line. The SEC will make its final decision on VanEck's application on May 23.

Ripple v. SEC case update as of May 21, 2024


    As the wait for the final resolution to the long-running courtroom standoff between Ripple and the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) is still keeping the cryptocurrency community at the edge of its seat, the regulator has responded to the blockchain company’s request to seal certain information.



Specifically, after Ripple filed its motion to seal certain documents filed in connection with the SEC’s motion for judgment and remedies, the agency replied that this information should be public, as per the document shared by a defense attorney and former federal prosecutor, James K. Filan, in an X post on May 21.







Ripple v. SEC: Regulator’s reasoning



Indeed, as the document, addressed to Judge Analisa Torres, reads, the SEC states that the “Court should deny Ripple’s request to conceal financial and securities sales information because that information constitutes ‘judicial documents,’” arguing that:








“The SEC does not challenge the sealing of Ripple’s recent financial statements as a whole. But where financial figures or specific terms of contracts have been used by the parties to calculate and justify remedy requests, that information should be made public.”




At the same time, legal expert and popular commenter on the case, Bill Morgan, has pointed out that the SEC has acknowledged that none of the XRP sales to institutions with discounts were on-demand liquidity (ODL) contracts. That said, he also stated that:




“It remains a mystery why Judge Torres lumped them in with the other contracts with Institutions. I bet the SEC knows the ODL contracts are not investment contracts.”




SEC v. Ripple news



As a reminder, Ripple earlier filed a motion to seal or redact confidential information, including the company’s “negotiated financial terms of its contractual agreements with certain third-party business partners,” with support from its chief financial officer, Jonathan Bilich, as Finbold reported on May 14.







In early May, the regulator submitted a remedies reply brief, in which it argued for the need for injunctions, stressing that Ripple’s claims refuting the accusations of acting recklessly were “contrary to the evidence” and accusing the crypto firm of planning “to issue a new unregistered crypto asset,” referring to a new stablecoin.



Meanwhile, XRP, the token at the center of this ongoing legal battle, was at press time trading at the price of $0.54, recording a 5.76% gain on the day, growing 7.27% across the week, and accumulating an increase of 2.03% in the past month, as per the most recent charts on May 21.

                        Bitcoin Price PredictionBitcoin price predictions are gaining significant attention as the cryptocurrency’s value approaches its all-time high. Recent surges have propelled Bitcoin to $71,000, fueled by strong inflows into Bitcoin spot ETFs and renewed interest from institutional investors like Morgan Stanley and JPMorgan.The overall positive market sentiment, bolstered by the potential approval of Ethereum ETFs, further supports the bullish outlook. As Bitcoin nears its peak, speculation about its future performance intensifies among investors and analysts alike.



Increased Digital Asset Investments Boost Bitcoin Inflows










Recent data shows a notable rise in investments in digital asset products, despite lower overall trading volumes. Total inflows reached $932 million for the second consecutive week, primarily driven by an unexpected Consumer Price Index (CPI) report.
This report spurred a surge in investment, with 89% of inflows occurring in the last three trading days. Bitcoin saw substantial inflows of $942 million, indicating growing investor confidence.

Other cryptocurrencies like Solana, Chainlink, and Cardano also attracted investments.
Ethereum faced $23 million in outflows due to ETF approval concerns.
Blockchain-related stocks experienced challenges with outflows.
The U.S. led with $1.002 billion in inflows, supported by positive developments at Grayscale.
Switzerland and Germany saw modest gains, while Hong Kong and Canada had outflows.

The increased investment in digital asset products, particularly Bitcoin, highlights the market’s positive sentiment and confidence in its future performance.





Ethereum ETF Approval Boosts Market Sentiment and Bitcoin Price
Ethereum’s price jumped over 16% as Bloomberg analysts raised the likelihood of spot Ethereum ETF approval to 75%, citing potential political pressure on the SEC.However, Grayscale’s CEO stepping down complicates the situation ahead of the SEC’s decisions on VanEck’s and Ark 21Shares’ ETF applications, expected on May 23 and 24.Nate Geraci outlined the SEC’s ETF approval process, indicating that approval of 19b-4 filings could lead to eventual S-1 approvals. Despite initial doubts due to the CEO’s resignation, the improved ETF approval odds suggest a positive outlook for Ethereum.
Ethereum price surged by 16%
Increased ETF approval odds to 75%
Grayscale’s CEO resignation adds complexity
SEC decisions due on May 23 and 24
The potential approval of Ethereum ETFs is likely to boost market sentiment, which could also positively influence Bitcoin’s price due to the correlation between major cryptocurrencies.Bitcoin (BTC/USD) currently trades at $71,254, down 0.75% amid correction, yet Bitcoin price prediction remains bullish. The 4-hour chart indicates several key price levels to monitor. The pivot point is set at $71,995, with immediate resistance at $73,306, followed by further resistance levels at $74,567 and $75,656. On the downside, immediate support is at $70,560, with additional support levels at $69,695 and $68,263.Technical indicators suggest a cautious outlook. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) stands at 80, indicating overbought conditions that often precede a pullback. The 50-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA) is positioned at $65,588, underscoring the underlying bullish trend despite recent volatility.Bitcoin Price PredictionBitcoin has recently closed a Doji candle, followed by solid bullish engulfing candles, which typically signal a potential bearish correction. On the downside, BTC could drop to the 38.2% Fibonacci retracement level around $69,500.Conversely, a bullish breakout above $72,000 could pave the way for further gains towards $73,275 or even $74,500.
Current Trend: Bitcoin’s technical outlook is bearish below $72,000. A break above this level could shift sentiment to a more bullish bias, targeting $73,275 and beyond. 
Conversely, failure to hold above immediate support at $70,560 may lead to further declines towards $69,695 and $68,263.

Ex-Ethereum Dev Joins Staking Startup: Can He Prevent a Dystopian Future?


							

Ethereum researcher Dankrad Feist joins restaking protocol EigenLayer



Feist to focus on decentralization & risks associated with restaking



Feist to help mitigate risks, sees potential benefits for Ethereum




Ethereum Foundation researcher Dankrad Feist has been appointed as an advisor to EigenLayer, a restaking protocol for the Ethereum blockchain. Feist’s decision, announced in a recent online post, follows a similar move by fellow Ethereum researcher Justin Drake, who joined EigenLayer earlier.







Feist emphasized that his role as an advisor is undertaken in a personal capacity and is not affiliated with the Ethereum Foundation. He has pledged to prioritize issues of decentralization and the inherent risks associated with restaking protocols. While collaborating with EigenLayer, Feist is expected to offer critical perspectives on the project’s development.









Feist elaborated on the potential dangers of restaking, highlighting the principal-agent problem as a key concern. This long standing issue, also present in Liquid Staking Tokens (LSTs), arises when a conflict of interest exists between delegators and those managing their staked assets.



Feist further identified the increased burden on stakers when running restaking services, which in turn leads to centralizing forces. In addition, he talked about the idea of “dystopia” that many community members fear, where poorly designed restaking services become commonplace due to their supposed yield advantages.




 “Something many fear is that Eigenlayer will lead to a dystopia of dangerously designed restaking services that stakers will have to opt in, because they will provide most of the staking yield. I think restaking yield will be much more moderate as (a) if there were very high yields to have… (b) total crypto revenue is very moderate and I think the appetite to pay restakers by diluting tokens will not be that high.” 




Feist concludes by expressing that his main focus is to help EigenLayer to overcome these threats. Commenting on the protocol’s potential, he cited, “I think Eigenlayer will be a major benefit to Ethereum.”

Kaspa (KAS) Price Avoids Death Cross: Could a 12% Rally Follow?


Kaspa’s (KAS) price is observing positive signals from its investors, and the broader market is also supporting a rally.
The chances of the altcoin marking a monthly high in May are solid, which could propel KAS to a key price point.
Kaspa Holders Pour in Money

Kaspa’s price is increasing, and investors are helping drive this rally. This is likely due to the sudden surge noted in the Open Interest (OI). Open interest refers to the total number of outstanding derivative contracts, such as options or futures, that have not been settled. 
It is a key indicator of market activity and liquidity, showing money flow into or out of a market.
In the last 24 hours, the OI surged by $6 million, the highest within a single day this quarter. The last time Kaspa noted $6 million inflows into OI was in early April over a period of two weeks.

This shows that investors want to make the most out of the present opportunity.
Secondly, the broader market also exhibits bullishness, which is evident in the Relative Strength Index (RSI). The Relative Strength Index (RSI) is a momentum oscillator that measures the speed and change of price movements from 0 to 100. 
Typically, an RSI above 70 indicates an overbought condition, while an RSI below 30 suggests an oversold condition.

Currently, KAS is in the bullish zone above the neutral mark at 50.0 but below the overbought threshold. This will provide the altcoin enough room for growth as we advance.
KAS Price Prediction: A Rally Ahead?

Kaspa’s price is changing hands at $0.13 at the time of writing after escaping the Death Cross earlier this month. A death cross is a bearish formation that occurs when the long-term 200-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA) crosses over the short-term 50-day EMA. This usually results in correction.
But KAS escaped this and is recovering, inching close to the resistance at $0.14. Flipping this resistance into support would mark a 12% rally and enable the altcoin to head towards $0.15, a key technical and psychological price level.

However, a failed breach could result in Kaspa’s price falling back down to the support of $0.11. Losing this support would extend the decline and invalidate the bullish outlook.

US House of Representatives to Vote on 'Decentralization Law': Details


The long-awaited "decentralization bill" might be accepted by the end of this month. Its full title is the Financial Innovation and Technology for the 21st Century Act, and it might make cryptocurrency regulation much clearer and more understandable for us.By the end of this month, the House of Representatives will vote on a major bill (HR 4763) — one that is crucial for the crypto industry. Known as the Financial Innovation and Technology for the 21st Century Act (FIT21), this bill could significantly clarify crypto regulations in the U.S. If passed, FIT21 will provide blockchain projects with a safer and more effective pathway to launch in the United States. It will outline the responsibilities between the SEC and CFTC, determining whether digital assets are securities or commodities. Additionally, it will ensure oversight of crypto exchanges and further protect American consumers by implementing rules on crypto trading.According to the bill, the CFTC would regulate a digital asset as a commodity if the blockchain or digital ledger on which it runs is functional and decentralized. Conversely, the SEC would regulate a digital asset as a security if its associated blockchain is functional but not decentralized. The bill defines decentralization as the condition where no person has unilateral authority to control the blockchain or its usage, and no issuer or affiliated person has control of 20% or more of the digital asset or its voting power.The bill also establishes other consumer protection requirements, such as the segregation of customer funds, lock-up periods for token insiders, limitations on annual sales volumes and disclosure requirements. Despite being around for over a decade, the crypto industry has lacked a proper regulatory framework in the United States. The current regulatory environment is quite unclear, creating challenges for innovation and development of the industry. For example, legitimate entrepreneurs and start-ups have been subject to "regulation-by-enforcement," which hurts innovation and economic growth for the sector in the U.S., causing migration of crypto-related companies into other jurisdictions.

Macro Strategist Jim Bianco Reveals Retail Investors Hold 85% of Bitcoin ETF Shares As of Q1 2024 - The Daily Hodl


								Macro strategist Jim Bianco is blowing up the narrative that institutions and high-net-worth investors are the ones heavily accumulating shares in Bitcoin (BTC) exchange-traded funds (ETFs).
Bianco tells his 398,400 followers on the social media platform X that new mandatory 13F filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) reveal the breakdown of investor types in the spot BTC ETFs for the first quarter of 2024.










“Anyone with over 5% beneficial ownership or at least $100 million in assets must file a 13F within 45 days of the end of the quarter. This was May 15th. ~7,000 were filed. 
What did we learn from the spot BTC ETF filings? 
The table below shows some top-line results. 
The shaded blue area shows the investment advisors’ holdings. They are very small, between 2.5% and 4% (and 8.81% for GBTC). A recent Citi report says the average ETF is about 35% owned by investment advisors. Throughout the quarter, we were confidently told boomers were calling their wealth managers and telling them to get into BTC. This is not the case for 95+% of the spot BTC ETF holdings.“
Source: Jim Bianco/X
He says the forms reveal that about 85% of investors in the spot Bitcoin ETFs are retail investors as of the first three months of the year.
“I feared the spot BTC ETFs were effectively ‘orange FOMO poker chips.’ The Q1 13F filings only further convinced me this was the case. 
Only ~3% of the outstanding ETF market cap was held by investment advisors, completely blowing up the narrative that ‘the Boomers are coming.’ They might over time (as in years) but did not in Q1. ~10% is held by hedge funds, and ~85% by non-institutional investors (read: retail).”
At time of writing, Bitcoin is trading for $70,947, up over 7% in the past day.

Ethereum ETF approval odds jump from 25% to 75% - What changed? - AMBCrypto



ETH ETF approval odds jumped from 25% to 75% after the recent SEC update.
The market rallied, but 100% ETF approval is not guaranteed unless S-1s are approved, too. 

The US SEC’s reported surprise 180-degree pivot on Ethereum [ETH] ETF approval has tipped Bloomberg analysts to increase chances of approval odds from 25% to 75%. 
According to Bloomberg ETF analyst Eric Balchunas, the approval became a ‘political issue’ and could have led to the SEC’s move.
‘Update: @JSeyff, and I are increasing our odds of spot Ether ETF approval to 75% (up from 25%), hearing chatter this afternoon that SEC could be doing a 180 on this (increasingly political issue), so now everyone scrambling (like us everyone else assumed they’d be denied).’
The SEC has reportedly asked exchanges to update 19b-4 filings on an accelerated basis. This signals an approval intention per most market watchers.  
SEC’s update on Ethereum ETF approval
For the unfamiliar, an ETF can only be launched or sold to the US public when the SEC approves 19b-4 and S-1 forms. 
Exchanges like the NYSE and Nasdaq submit the 19b-4 forms (also known as Exchange Rule Changes) to the SEC when listing a new product on their platforms. 
The S-1 forms, also known as ‘Registration Statements,’ are filed by potential issuers, in this case, asset managers like BlackRock, VanEck, etc. They cover the structure of the funds, their management, and the operations of the proposed ETF product. 
The development that shored up ETF approval odds from 25% to 75% involved the Exchange Rule Changes (19b-4s). 
According to Balchunas, the SEC requested updated 19b-4s from exchanges by the morning on 21st May.
“Hearing the SEC wants revised 19b-4s returned to them by 10 am tomorrow morning (based on a bunch of comments they just received today) for likely approval as soon as Wednesday.’
Ethereum ETF approval and its impact
The development was reflected in the prediction market, Polymarket, as approval odds jumped from 10% to 59% at the time of writing. 
The changed sentiment was also evident on ETH price charts. The altcoin jumped by over 19% and hit $3.7K, erasing April losses. The bullish sentiment boosted the whole crypto sector, including Ethereum Classic [ETC]. 
ETC rallied by 17%, from $28 to $32.9, and flipped the market structure bullish. With the ETC halving event deadline (31st May) fast approaching, ETH’s update could set ETC for a wild upside. 
However, according to Coinglass data, leveraged ETH short traders suffered the most from the update, with $79 million worth of short positions liquidated in the past 12 hours. 
That said, it’s worth noting that the update only involved the 19b-4s and not the S-1s. Nate Geraci of ETF Store predicted that SEC’s update could lead to ‘technical’ approval of 19b-4s but a slow-paced play on S-1s. 
“Technically possible for SEC to approve 19b-4s & then slow play S-1s (esp given reported lack of engagement here)”
If the 19b-4s are approved, the ETH ETF’s final approval could take some time. But according to some market watchers, it will be a matter of when, not ‘if.’ However, the staking feature remains an unresolved issue at this stage.

Expert Slams SEC Chairman For Lack Of Clarity On Ethereum's Regulatory Status | Bitcoinist.com


								As discussion regarding Ethereum‘s status heats up, the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) Chairman Gary Gensler has come under fire from well-known cryptocurrency market watcher and Cinneamhain Ventures founder Adam Cochran for the continued lack of clarity surrounding Ethereum regulations.
Cochran’s criticism is focused on what he believes to be the SEC’s erratic and ambiguous position regarding Ethereum’s classification, which might be impeding innovation in the cryptocurrency landscape and causing a great deal of uncertainty.
Need For Gensler’s Emphasis On Ethereum’s Legal Status
The Cinneamhain Ventures founder Adam Cochran noted that he would like to see one of the other SEC cases moved forward right away, citing its case with Ethereum. 

He demands that Paul Grewal, the Chief Legal Officer (CLO) of Coinbase should ask Gary Gensler to clarify in court how ETH, which he believes is not a security, differs from several assets he has asserted are securities in their cases.
It is worth noting that ETH is currently being investigated by the SEC to determine whether it should be classified as a security. As a result, several companies have been served subpoenas by the Commission, requesting financial information and documentation pertaining to their interactions with the Ethereum Foundation.
Following Ethereum’s successful move to a proof-of-stake basis in September 2022, the investigation seems to have gathered momentum. This transition appears to have potentially impacted the asset’s status as the agency considers the transition similar to an investment contract.
Cochran might be insinuating that the SEC’s chairman may not be able to provide clarity on the matter, claiming that Gensler’s meltdown would be historic.
The founder has been a constant vocal critic of Gensler, blasting the chairman on multiple occasions. Adam Cochran previously called Gensler a political weasel, following news of the SEC demanding that ETH Spot Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs) applicants update their 19b-4s filing.
Responding to the development Cochran highlighted that it stands as a big win for ETH regarding its status as a non-security asset. “Ethereum is not a security, you overreached and were forced into line, you political weasel,” he stated.
Qualified Figure To Replace Gensler
Adam Cochran is displeased with Gensler’s tenor and hopes to see the chairman step down someday soon, in order for someone more qualified and rational to take control.

Thus, he cites the SEC’s Commissioner Hester Pierce as the right figure for the position, if the Biden-Harris administration gets tired of Gensler. “But, if not me, I would settle for someone rational and qualified, you know like Hester Peirce, who is already at the commission, engaged in topics, and a great way to show cross-aisle collaboration to court swing voters,” he stated
According to the founder, when financial regulation was not overseen by a self-serving clown like Gensler, many moderate and fiscal Republicans would be willing to vote.

                        Yuga Labs, the company behind of the iconic and influential NFT collection CryptoPunks, has faced significant backlash and controversy over its latest venture.After introducing CryptoPunks into museums, Yuga Labs revealed plans to allow notable artists to contribute to the project with the official Punks stamp.The first effort involved artist Nina Chanel Abney, who was initially chosen as the inaugural selection for the Punk in Residence program.Abney’s Super Punk World Prompts Controversy
She unveiled her new collection, “Super Punk World,” over the weekend at The School at the Jack Shainman Gallery in New York.The planned NFTs for the collection were revealed on Monday. The collection featured her hand-selected avatars, which drew inspiration from the iconic CryptoPunks traits and her previous work.Each avatar was meticulously curated and digitized to create 195 unique 3D-sculpted attributes, reflecting Abney’s aesthetic while paying homage to the irreverent roots of the CryptoPunks project.Yuga Labs intended to introduce wallets, generative art, Web3, and NFTs to a more traditional art crowd and collectors.“We’re trying to bring CryptoPunks to the masses here, in a way,” Nathalie Stone, General Manager and Brand Lead of CryptoPunks, said, “but also have them understand why digital ownership matters.”Abney’s collection also addressed pricing disparities in NFT collections based on gender and skin tone, challenging societal perceptions of value and implicit biases.However, once Abney’s interpretation of CryptoPunks was revealed, the project faced a wave of backlash on social media.“Woke” Artwork
Critics attacked the art style, the attempt to reimagine an iconic project, and accusations of being “woke” due to the emphasis on race and gender.The project also received negative attention for diluting the original CryptoPunks collection, with some collectors expressing their dissatisfaction with Yuga Labs’ attempt to expand a project that is considered a valuable “blue chip” Ethereum NFT set.Initially, Yuga Labs chose not to comment on the backlash.However, CEO Greg “Garga” Solano later tweeted a statement clarifying their stance.He said that the NFTs, originally planned for auction, will now be distributed in some way to Super Cool World NFT holders, possibly through a randomized airdrop.Additionally, there will be no follow-up artist residency initiative in the same manner.“Yuga will no longer touch Punks… The only thing we intend to do is support a few museums and institutions in their quest to acquire a Punk and help educate their audience about them.”Back in March, Starbucks, the renowned multinational coffee chain, made the decision to terminate its NFT rewards program.The move by Starbucks follows a trend of companies discontinuing their involvement in the NFT space.In January, gaming retailer GameStop announced the closure of its NFT marketplace after scaling back its crypto services over the past two years.More recently, X (formerly Twitter), under the ownership of Elon Musk, discontinued a feature that allowed premium users to use NFT images as their profile pictures.

Eagle Materials (EXP) Reports Q4: EPS and Revenue Fail to Meet Expectations - Tokenist


					
Neither the author, Tim Fries, nor this website, The Tokenist, provide financial advice. Please consult our website policy prior to making financial decisions.



Eagle Materials Inc. (NYSE: EXP) reported its financial results for the fiscal fourth quarter and full year ended March 31, 2024. Despite facing some challenges, the company achieved notable milestones in revenue and profitability, underscoring its resilience and strategic focus. For the fourth quarter of fiscal 2024, Eagle Materials reported revenue of $476.7 million, reflecting a 1% increase compared to the same period last year.



However, net earnings for the quarter were $77.1 million, marking a 23% decline. Diluted earnings per share (EPS) for the quarter stood at $2.24, down 20%. The quarter’s adjusted EBITDA was $154.4 million, a decrease of 10% from the previous year. The company attributed these declines to adverse weather conditions and increased maintenance costs in its Cement, concrete, and Aggregates segments.



For the full fiscal year 2024, Eagle Materials achieved record revenue of $2.3 billion, up 5% from the prior year. Net earnings for the year were also a record, reaching $477.6 million, a 3% increase. The company reported record diluted EPS of $13.61, up 9%, and adjusted EBITDA of $834.5 million, up 7%. The company also repurchased 1.9 million shares of its common stock for $343 million, demonstrating its commitment to returning value to shareholders.



Eagle Materials Falls Short of EPS and Revenue Expectations in Q1



When comparing the current performance against expectations, Eagle Materials’ fourth-quarter results fell short of analysts’ estimates. The expected EPS for the quarter was $2.67, whereas the actual EPS was $2.24, a significant shortfall. Similarly, the anticipated revenue was $482.29 million, but the company reported $476.7 million, missing the mark by a narrow margin. The lower-than-expected performance can be attributed to the adverse weather conditions and increased maintenance costs, which impacted the company’s Cement and Concrete and Aggregates segments.



Despite these challenges, the full-year performance of Eagle Materials was more aligned with expectations. The company achieved record revenue and earnings, demonstrating its ability to navigate a challenging economic environment. The strategic investments and operational efficiencies implemented throughout the year contributed significantly to this strong performance.





Eagle Materials Cautiously Optimistic on Fiscal 2025 Guidance



Eagle Materials has provided guidance that reflects cautious optimism. The company expects the underlying fundamentals in its markets to remain solid during fiscal 2025, supported by large-scale infrastructure spending and domestic manufacturing projects. Additionally, the company anticipates increased residential construction activity as mortgage rates stabilize and the housing supply shortage continues. These factors are expected to drive strong demand for cement, a key product for Eagle Materials.



The company has also announced several growth initiatives, including the start-up of a slag-cement facility in Houston and a $430 million investment to modernize and expand its Mountain Cement facility in Wyoming. These projects are expected to enhance the company’s production capacity, reduce manufacturing costs, and lower the carbon intensity of its operations. The slag-cement facility, set to begin operations this summer, will have a manufacturing capacity of 500,000 tons, catering to the increasing demand in the Texas market.

Why Fidelity Opted Out of Ethereum Staking in ETF?


Fidelity Investments has revised its upcoming spot, Ethereum exchange-traded fund (ETF), notably removing the staking feature. 
This modification, detailed in the latest S-1 filing with the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), reflects a strategic shift in response to regulatory uncertainties.
Why Fidelity Removed Staking Facility?

The filing states that the Trust will neither stake the Ethereum it holds nor invest in derivatives. Designed to provide a simple and efficient avenue for Ethereum investment, the ETF avoids the complexities of direct crypto transactions. Fidelity clarified that it would not participate in the Ethereum network’s proof-of-stake validation mechanism.
Emphasizing the passive investment strategy, the Trust declared that shareholders will play a minimal role in its management. Shareholders will also lack voting rights in most situations.
Read more: Ethereum ETF Explained: What It Is and How It Works
Regarding asset custody, the Ethereum will be securely stored in segregated accounts. Most of these assets will be in cold storage to maximize security, with a minor portion in hot storage to facilitate operational efficiency.
This is a pivot from Fidelity’s S-1 filing in March 2024. Back then, the asset manager planned to include the staking facility in its spot Ethereum ETF.
This strategic change coincides with growing speculation about the SEC’s approach to Ethereum ETFs, especially those that include staking. 

“If the speculation about a 180 from SEC on the Ethereum ETFs is true, I would guess they try to thread a needle between “ETH” NOT being a security and “staked ETH” as being a security. That would allow SEC to approve Ethereum ETFs while maintaining their previously stated opinions,” Alex Thorn, the Head of Research at Galaxy Digital said.


However, without staking facilities, ETF investors cannot earn the extra yield that is possible through participation in the proof-of-stake validation mechanism. Crypto-savvy investors might prefer Ethereum’s self-custody and stake on various decentralized platforms rather than investing through ETFs.
Nonetheless, if the SEC approves spot Ethereum ETFs, it would be a milestone, representing the amalgamation of altcoins with the traditional finance market.

Amid these regulatory deliberations, optimism is rising regarding the likelihood of spot Ethereum ETF approvals. This is because Bloomberg ETF analysts Eric Balchunas and James Seyffart have increased their approval probability from 25% to 75%.

Sei Foundation Proposes EVM-Compatible Blockchain Upgrade


The Sei Foundation has proposed a significant upgrade to the Sei blockchain, transitioning to version 2.
This upgrade aims to introduce a high-performance, parallelized Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM), set to enhance the network’s capabilities. 
Sei Network’s Transition to Version 2: Enhancing Performance

On Monday, the foundation announced a proposal to upgrade the Sei blockchain to version 2. If approved it will take place a week later.
The upgrade will enable seamless porting of Ethereum-based contracts to Sei, offering sub-second transaction finality. This means the blockchain will confirm and finalize transactions in less than one second, enhancing user experience and network efficiency with near-instantaneous processing.
In addition, Sei v2 will provide compatibility and advanced features like parallelized execution. This positions it to compete with other parallelized EVMs like Monad and Neon.
The blockchain will also integrate SeiDB, a new data structure for the platform’s storage layer. This will help manage data more efficiently. It will reduce state bloat and minimize the excessive growth of stored data. This integration will also facilitate smoother state synchronization for new network nodes. New nodes will update quickly and accurately with the latest information.
Market Impact and Future Prospects of the Upgrade
The proposed upgrade will be implemented in three stages: governance voting, alpha launch, and beta launch. The initial stage involves governance voting, which, if approved, will lead to an alpha launch where only partners can use the infrastructure.

“Crucially, the work to continuously optimize Sei does not end here. The goal is to build a blockchain that can support truly consumer-grade applications, serving millions of users,” Sei team noted.

According to Sei Labs, prominent Ethereum-based applications such as Uniswap, Frax, X2Y2, Bancor, Balancer, Rarible, Layer Zero, Nansen, and The Graph plan to deploy on the Sei v2 network. Since its mainnet beta launch in August 2023, the network has supported Cosmos-based dapps written in Rust.

The announcement of the v2 upgrade positively impacted its market performance. The cryptocurrency’s value increased by 10% following the news, highlighting the market’s optimistic view of the upgrade’s potential to enhance the network’s functionalities.

Crypto guru Willy Woo predicts Bitcoin short squeeze to all-time high


    With the cryptocurrency market sentiment turning bullish and leading cryptocurrencies Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) posting solid gains in the past 24 hours, the race to new all-time highs has begun.



Bitcoin added 6.06% to its value the previous day, propelling it above the $70,000 threshold for the first time in over a month. Due to the short squeeze, experts believe the new all-time high for the flagship crypto is approaching, as traders who had bet against Bitcoin are forced to buy back their positions, further driving up the price.



In the past 24 hours, a sudden decrease in the number of short BTC positions has been noted. The number fell from 291 BTC to just 165, meaning that almost half of the short positions were liquidated with Bitcoin’s rapid price increase, leading to a cascade of buy orders as they rushed to cover their shorts.

Willy Woo sees this short squeeze as record-setting



The most recent liquidation of 1 month of Bitcoin short positions leaves only one layer of shorts before a potential short squeeze that could propel the maiden crypto to new all-time highs, according to cryptocurrency expert Willy Woo’s post on X on May 21.

If the thesis holds, the current price difference of just 2.92% will be easily surpassed, making a new all-time high above the previous $73,079 on March 14 a reality.



Patterns similar to previous bull runs



Zooming out on the price charts can often offer an additional layer of insight for traders, and that is exactly what professionals do when trying to predict potential future moves.



This price pattern closely resembles the one of the 2017 bull run, which saw BTC’s price surge by over 800%, going from $2,100 to almost $20,000 in a span of six months–an increase that happened from May to December.Now, crypto trading analyst Jelle thinks that history is repeating once again, as patterns look strikingly similar, according to the post on May 21.

If gains are similar, the current bull run may elevate Bitcoin price well above $100,000, with the potential for gains being even higher as the price goes into uncharted territory.

Ethereum (ETH) price Surges on ETF Approval Rumors


                                ETH price increased due to speculation about ETF approvals                                The second-largest Cryptocurrency in the crypto market, Ethereum, has been garnering attention lately due to the accelerated speculation regarding the imminent approval of Ethereum ETFs. Recently, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has instructed exchanges to update their 19B-4 filings for their Spot Ethereum ETFs. The SEC is urging exchanges interested in Ethereum ETFs to update their filings, indicating that the SEC may soon move forward with approving ETF applications.This is significant news for Ethereum, signaling its potential to follow in the footsteps of Bitcoin and establish its own ETF. However, before ETFs go live, applicants must also have their S-1 applications approved. The approval process for Ethereum ETFs is progressing rapidly, suggesting that we may soon witness Ethereum ETFs in the market. Some market experts even speculate that Ethereum ETF approval could happen as early as this month.Ethereum Price SurgedThe news of Ethereum ETF approval has had an impact on Ethereum, leading to a significant surge. In the last 24 hours, Ethereum's price has risen by 19%, currently trading at $3,678, with a market cap of $443 billion. Additionally, ETH has increased its weekly gains by over 25%. On the other hand, daily trading volume for ETH has also surged by more than 264%, surpassing $36.24 billion.The first decision on the VanEck spot Ethereum ETF is expected by Thursday, May 23rd. Thus, we can expect price fluctuations to continue. Any positive developments could push Ethereum's price above $4,000 and beyond.Ethereum Whales have become ActiveDue to the price surge in Ethereum, Ethereum whales have also become active. In the past 24 hours, Ethereum whales have purchased 110,000 ETH worth $341 million. Additionally, despite a strong rally in Bitcoin, the ETH/BTC pair is experiencing rapid growth. As a result, some market players have started exchanging their Bitcoin for Ethereum. Despite observing Ethereum whale activity, it is speculated that the price of Ethereum may continue to rise, potentially reaching the $4,000 level easily.Also Read:- Bitcoin's Ascent: How Close Is It to Becoming the Ultimate Asset?

Yen Slump: Is This a Lose-Lose for Global Trade and Crypto?


							

Weakening Yen sparks fears of trade disruption & likely crypto impact.



China shifts focus to manufacturing, challenging Japan’s exports.



Stable USDCNY rate remains crucial with possible US Fed interventions.




The recent depreciation of the Japanese Yen against the US Dollar has sparked economic anxieties across global markets. Financial experts, including former BitMEX CEO Arthur Hayes, are closely monitoring the situation due to its potential to disrupt international trade, exacerbate currency competition, and ultimately, impact the cryptocurrency sector.



In response to Japan’s monetary policy, China appears to be shifting its economic focus from real estate to strengthening its manufacturing sector. This strategic move, aimed at boosting export competitiveness, carries particular significance for the automotive industry, a major export sector for both China and Japan.

As the CNY/JPY exchange rate climbs, Chinese products become less competitive relative to their Japanese counterparts thereby escalating tensions between these two economic powerhouses.

Caption: Relatively stable USDCNY exchange rate over recent years, despite global economic turbulence



Meanwhile, the relative stability of the USD/CNY exchange rate remains a critical factor in this evolving situation. Hayes speculates on the potential role of the U.S. Federal Reserve and Treasury in managing these currency dynamics through interventions such as currency swaps.



These economic maneuvers are of particular interest to the cryptocurrency market as they can influence global liquidity and potentially affect cryptocurrency valuations. The USD/JPY rate is especially crucial for crypto traders, as fluctuations in this rate can have immediate consequences for market conditions. Hayes argues,




“The real ‘oh, they are real fucked’ moment came as I read two recent Solid Ground newsletters… about the lose-lose situation in which the monetary mandarins in charge of Japan and Pax Americana wallow.”




Moreover, Arthur Hayes’ recent insights shed light on the underlying factors driving the yen’s depreciation, pointing to Japan’s monetary policies aimed at maintaining export competitiveness by devaluing their currency.









Finally, he explores the broader implications of currency movements, particularly the Japanese Yen, and their potential to destabilize economic conditions and influence global economic policies.

Lowe's Companies (LOW) Q1 2024: EPS Decline Amid 4.1% Sales Drop - Tokenist


					
Neither the author, Tim Fries, nor this website, The Tokenist, provide financial advice. Please consult our website policy prior to making financial decisions.



Lowe’s Companies, Inc. (NYSE: LOW) has released its financial results for the first quarter of 2024, showcasing a mixed performance. The company reported net earnings of $1.8 billion, translating to a diluted earnings per share (EPS) of $3.06.



This is a decrease from the previous year’s first-quarter diluted EPS of $3.77, including gains from the 2022 sale of its Canadian retail business. When adjusted for these gains, the diluted EPS for Q1 2023 was $3.67. Total sales for the quarter came in at $21.4 billion, down from $22.3 billion in the prior year. The decline in comparable sales by 4.1% was partially attributed to decreased DIY big-ticket discretionary spending, although this was somewhat balanced by positive sales in the Pro and online segments.



Despite declining comparable sales, Marvin R. Ellison, Lowe’s chairman, president, and CEO, expressed satisfaction with the company’s start to the spring season. He highlighted strong execution and enhanced customer service as key drivers. The quarter saw the national rollout of a new DIY loyalty program, expanded same-day delivery options, and market share gains in key categories. Ellison also noted the company’s growing momentum with its Total Home strategy, which is reflected in the growth of Pro and online sales. As of May 3, 2024, Lowe’s operated 1,746 stores, covering 194.9 million square feet of retail space.



Lowe’s Beats Expectations in Q1 But Sales Down by 4.1% 



The company exceeded EPS forecasts when comparing Lowe’s current performance against market expectations. Analysts had anticipated an EPS of $2.95, but the actual figure was higher at $3.06. This beat suggests that Lowe’s managed to control costs effectively or gain efficiencies in its operations. The revenue also exceeded expectations ($2.14 billion) slightly, coming in at $21.4 billion.



The decrease in comparable sales by 4.1% is a significant factor. The decline in DIY big-ticket discretionary spending was a notable drag on sales, although this was partially offset by gains in the Pro and online segments. The company’s gross margin also saw a slight decline, from 33.68% in Q1 2023 to 33.19% in Q1 2024. Additionally, operating income as a percentage of sales decreased from 14.71% to 12.42%. These figures suggest that while Lowe’s managed to maintain profitability, it faced challenges in driving sales growth and maintaining margins.





Lowe’s Affirms FY2024 Outlook, Expects Total Sales Between $84 Billion and $85 Billion



Lowe’s has affirmed its full-year 2024 outlook, providing a range of guidance metrics. The company expects total sales to be between $84 billion and $85 billion, with comparable sales projected to decline by 2% to 3% compared to the previous year.

Inflows into Bitcoin ETFs Continue as the Likelihood of Approval of Ethereum ETFs Increases! Here are the Details - Bitcoin Sistemi

US spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) had another big day on Monday, with net inflows of $241.12 million. This marks the sixth consecutive day of inflows, the longest streak of positive momentum for these funds since mid-March.
Spot Bitcoin ETFs Report Net Inflows for Sixth Day in a Row
Ark Invest and 21Shares' spot Bitcoin ETF led this rush, receiving $68 million in new investment.


BlackRock's IBIT followed closely behind at $66 million, according to SoSoValue data. Fidelity's FBTC reported a net inflow of $64 million, while Bitwise's spot ETF attracted $28 million in investment.
Grayscale's GBTC, which until recently had mainly experienced net outflows, saw net inflows of $9 million. WisdomTree's BTCW fund added $5 million to the list.





Over the past six days, 11 spot Bitcoin ETFs have collectively generated more than $1.18 billion in net inflows, bringing total net inflows since January to $12.87 billion.
Despite this upward trend, overall flows for ETFs remain significantly lower than their peak levels in March.



In line with ETF inflows, the Bitcoin price increased by 6.35% in the last 24 hours, rising above $71,000. This price increase further underlines the growing investor interest and confidence in Bitcoin.
Bloomberg ETF analysts Eric Balchunas and James Seyffart noted that the likelihood of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission approving spot Ethereum ETFs has increased significantly, from 25% to 75%.





This shift in probability indicates broader acceptance and potential regulatory approval of more cryptocurrency-based investment products in the near future.

Arbitrum (ARB) Breaches Resistance Amid General Market Surge


Arbitrum’s (ARB) price has rallied above a key resistance level amid the rally in the general cryptocurrency market in the past 24 hours.
Trading at $1.15 at press time, the token’s 17% price growth in the past 24 hours mirrors the 8% spike in the global cryptocurrency market capitalization during that period. 
Arbitrum Sees Spike in Bullish Activity

Due to the increased activity around ARB in the past 24 hours, the token’s trading volume has seen a significant uptick. Totaling $1.04 billion at press time, the token’s trading volume is currently at its single-day highest level since March 21.

When an asset’s price rises alongside its trading volume, it is considered a bullish signal. It suggests that more traders are interested in buying the asset, increasing the price. 
The surge in market interest in ARB has been depicted in its rising futures open interest. Thus, at $243 million, the token’s futures open interest has increased by 19% in the past 24 hours.

ARB’s futures open interest tracks the total number of its futures contracts or positions that have not been closed or settled. When it rises this way, it suggests an uptick in market activity as more market participants move in to open new positions.
ARB Price Prediction: Why the Bulls Must Not Relent
In addition to rallying above resistance at $1.13, ARB’s price now sits above its 20-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA) and its 50-day Small Moving Average (SMA).
Conversely, when an asset’s price rallies past these key moving averages, it is viewed as a bullish signal because it suggests that the asset’s recent and medium-term price movements are positive. Traders view it as a signal that the asset in question is experiencing an upward momentum.
Confirming the upswing in demand for the altcoin, ARB’s Relative Strength Index (RSI) was 57.12, which was an uptrend. Furthermore, at this value, the momentum indicator suggested a preference for ARB accumulation over its distribution.

ARB’s price may touch $1.17 if this accumulation momentum is sustained.

However, if the buyers become exhausted, bears may regain control. This would allow them to push ARB’s price below resistance and force it to trade at $1.09.

The latest updates for the crypto Sora AI and Fetch.ai

In this article we delve into the crypto Sora AI and Fetch.ai, both linked to the artificial intelligence sector, reporting the most relevant news and analyzing the price action in the cryptographic market.
Let’s talk about two coins and two extremely different projects, with separate technological infrastructures and communities with different scopes.
Sora AI is indeed a much smaller project compared to Fetch.ai, which has already established itself on several occasions as one of the main leaders in big data and machine learning.
Let’s see everything in detail below.

Crypto and Artificial Intelligence: Sora AI and the art of imitation
Since OpenAi released ChatGPT in November 2023, the attention of crypto investors towards everything related to the world of artificial intelligence has grown significantly.
Thanks to the exploits of the graphics card manufacturer Nvidia, all cryptographic tokens related to AI have recorded a momentum as protagonists.
One of these, namely the community token Sora AI, has recorded a decent success despite not being in any way connected with the latest text-to-video model developed by the OpenAI leader, with its release scheduled for the second half of 2024.
Actually this cryptocurrency, while publicly admitting to not having affiliations with Sam Altman’s company, constantly publishes on X contents that suggest a connection with the new model of artificial intelligence that generates realistic images based on a text prompt.
This is a rather misleading marketing, where newcomers could be misled into thinking that the token is an official resource of OpenAI

In other contexts this token could be marked as scam, but in the midst of the hype madness for the AI sector, Sora AI has still managed to reach the milestone of 6,000 holders with a market capitalization of 4 million dollars.
The currency is also listed on several second-tier centralized exchanges.
It goes without saying that most likely this project will cease to exist and its investors will be left holding the candle.
Latest news for Fetch.ai: Chainlink integrated with BlockAgent
Speaking instead of a legitimate project, we report the latest updates at Fetch.ai, with very interesting news on the horizon.
The protocol, which aims to connect blockchain, AI agents and big data around a machine learning network, has recently incorporated Chainlink with the BlockAgent toolkit.
Quest’ultimo monitora le funzioni blockchain nel mondo reale, raccogliendo ed organizzando dati in base alle richieste degli utenti utilizzando la tecnologia Ai Agent di Fetch.ai

The integration of the Chainlink oracle with BlockAgent allows to obtain reliable price feeds of a wide range of cryptographic assets, relying on the track record of the project belonging to the Ethereum, Polygon, and Arbitrum networks.
In this way Fetch.ai users have the opportunity to organize their own set of data accurately and reliably, with the veracity of the information entrusted to Chainlink, and the automation of outputs (notifications, alerts, various interactions) in the real world entrusted to BlockAgent.
The use cases that emerge from this implementation are multiple, such as the creation of  marketplace NFT, tracking on-chain of a long set of data, the implementation of decentralized copy trading contracts and much more.
Other use cases include initiating effective trading on decentralized exchanges, monitoring governance activities related to DAOs, and providing real-time records to comply with established rules. 
Very likely with the growth of the Chainlink protocol and the expansion of the world of verifiable data from the oracle, opportunities for connection with the outside world will also grow and use cases related to the AI BlockAgent will also multiply.
The limit in this case is only the imagination.
Analysis of the prices of the crypto Sora AI and Fetch.ai
Let’s now see how the two tokens, Sora.AI (SORA) and Fetch.ai (FET) behave graphically in the cryptocurrency market.
Let’s start from the assumption that in addition to the technical side, these two resources are extremely different also in terms of capitalization and market share in the artificial intelligence sector.
In this sense SORA is much smaller and less known compared to FET, which ranks in the top 100 of the CoinMarketCap ranking.
By analyzing individually the price action of these two crypto, we can immediately notice how SORA in just 3 months has lost about 80% of its value after reaching the all-time high around 0.02 dollars.
At the time of writing this article, this resource is priced at 0.004 dollars, highlighting a very strong selling pressure due to the presence of a large supply of tokens against a virtually non-existent use case.
Not even with the concomitance of the pump of ETH  this coin managed to emerge, suggesting its decline and loss of public interest.
From March onwards, SORA investors have started to liquidate their positions pushing the prices of this crypto to its all-time lows.
Probably it will not be able to recover anymore and will end up losing several percentage points before disappearing definitively from the market.
Pay attention to these products, created ad hoc to push newcomers to invest and enrich its founders.

As for the Fetch.ai token, the price evolution tells a different story: the chart suggests a marked interest from investors, who in just one year of trading have pushed prices to grow by 10 times.
In the last 24 hours FET grows by 13%, approaching the historical high of 3.3 dollars and resuming the upward trend following a violent dip that characterized the entire market in the months of March and April.
The volumes are increasing and the currency is about to break the $2.6 resistance, thus canceling the last retracement and pushing prices towards much wider horizons.
In this case, the strong utility component of FET could help the project maintain a solid user and buyer base, thus keeping the prices of the cryptographic asset high.
However, it must be recognized how the speculation factor has driven the recent growth of FET and other AI-related tokens, pushing an irrational influx of capital into a sector that is still premature and lacking successful real-world applications.The potential of Fetch.ai is enormous, but investors have already priced in the achievement of great milestones, without taking into account the setbacks and difficulties that the project could encounter in the coming years.
For this reason, despite the sentiment on FET at this moment is clearly bullish, and could support another price growth, we believe that this crypto is overvalued.
Most likely from here to year, even with the next integration with Ocean and SingularityNet, and with the consequent merger of the token in ASI, those who invest now in this product will find themselves with a strong loss in their portfolio in the coming years.
The narratives of the crypto world unfortunately, if entered late, end up being extremely harmful and dangerous for the finances of the portfolio.

Dormant Bitcoin Wallet From 2013 Moves $7.6 Million in BTC


A long-inactive Bitcoin wallet has resurfaced, moving 114 BTC worth $7.6 million after nearly 11 years of dormancy.
The wallet, which dates back to 2013, made headlines as it transferred a substantial amount of Bitcoin, raising questions and concerns within the crypto community.
Dormant Bitcoin Wallet From 2013 Moves $7.6 Million

On May 19, 2024, the dormant wallet executed its first transaction in over a decade. This movement was detected by blockchain analysts and has sparked significant discussion about the potential implications for the Bitcoin market.
Dormant Bitcoin wallets are addresses that have not shown any activity for extended periods. When these wallets suddenly move large amounts of BTC, it often causes a stir. Analysts usually interpret such events as negative signals because they can indicate that early adopters or significant holders, sometimes referred to as “crypto whales,” are cashing out their holdings.
In the context of recent market trends, the reactivation of this wallet has come at a time when institutional interest in Bitcoin is on the rise. According to CryptoQuant, increased activity from institutional investors has led to fluctuations in previously dormant crypto addresses. 
This trend suggests that large holders are becoming more active, possibly in response to changing market conditions or new regulatory developments.

Understanding why dormant wallets move funds is noteworthy and requires some background in market psychology. Substantial sales of Bitcoin can flood the market with supply, potentially lowering prices.
However, Javier Bastardo, the Bitcoin Ambassador at Bitfinex, believes the dormant Bitcoin whale’s activities would have no significant impact on the market.

“I don’t think this is a significant movement that will affect or influence BTC price. However, it’s important for users to understand that there are a significant number of long-term investors who are ready to hold their BTC positions for years,” Bastardo told BeInCrypto.

A notable Bitcoin (BTC) transfer valued at $231.45 million has recently attracted attention. Thus, Whale Alert reported that an entity identified by the address "bc1qc" executed the transaction, transferring 3,250 BTC to Kraken, a major cryptocurrency exchange in the United States.The history of the sender’s address, "bc1qc," reveals limited information. Its initial transaction occurred in March 2024, receiving 0.002 BTC from another unidentified and now empty wallet. A closer examination of the transaction chain shows a series of exchanges between various unknown addresses over several months. This recent transaction represents a significant but not overwhelming portion of the wallet's total holdings. Currently, 20,282 BTC, valued at approximately $1.44 billion, remain stored in "bc1qc."Market participants often view such substantial transfers as potential indicators of a major player preparing to sell their holdings. Transferring Bitcoin to highly liquid platforms like Kraken is a common practice before executing large sales.  However, it has not yet been confirmed whether this transfer will result in an immediate sell-off.

                        The Ethereum price has shot up to $3,657 today, after the SEC asked Ethereum ETF applicants to submit new fillings ahead of a Thursday deadline.Analysts have taken this development as a sign that the SEC is likely to approve ETH ETFs this week, making Ethereum the second cryptocurrency after BTC to see spot-based ETFs in the US.This news has enabled ETH to post an 18% gain in 24 hours, while the alt is up by 25% in a week and by 15% in a month.And with the coin also sitting on a 100% return in a year, its long-term momentum could combine with ETF approvals to result in some big rallies in the very near future.Ethereum Price Prediction as ETF Decision Deadline Approaches – $10,000 ETH Possible?
Unsurprisingly, ETH’s chart has gone parabolic, with its price and indicators all shooting up in the past 12 hours.Its relative strength index (purple) climbed beyond 90 today, and while this would call for a correction, it still remains close to 80, showing big momentum.Source: TradingViewETH’s 30-day average (orange) is also flying well beyond its 200-day (blue), a clear sign that it has entered an expansionary phase and still has some growth to spare.What’s also highly bullish is that its volume has rocketed to $36 billion, up from $7.5 billion a day ago.This indicates some massive interest in the token, with traders and investors clearly trying to get into ETH before any spot-based ETF gains approval.And according to the latest reports, such approvals could arrive as early as this week, given that the SEC has asked applicants to quickly refile before an incoming deadline.The request for “accelerated” refilling is leading some to conclude that we will see approvals on Thursday – 23rd of May.This means ETH is likely to continue rallying, at least until this date.And while the cryptocurrency market has a tendency towards ‘buy the rumor, sell the news’ dynamics, the approval of spot-based ETH ETFs will see the Ethereum price climb steadily in the medium- and long-term.We need only remember what happened to Bitcoin’s price and volumes in February and early March, when institutions began jumping on the ETF bandwagon that set off in January.Something similar will happen to ETH, which could reach $5,000 by the end of summer if the ETFs do win approval this week.Diversify into Low-Cap Coins for More Upside Exposure
While ETH is undoubtedly one of the safest bets possible in crypto, there are alternatives traders can consider if they’re looking to diversify their portfolios and maximize their exposure to positive volatility.This includes one of the new meme tokens generating momentum right now, with several holding their presales as they get ready to list.Possibly the hottest such token at the moment is Dogeverse (DOGEVERSE), a multi-chain crypto that has raised in excess of $15 million in its presale.Source: DogeverseWhat sets Dogeverse apart from other new meme coins are its tokenomics and fundamentals, which combine to make it a serious investment prospect.As the first ever Doge-themed multi-chain cryptocurrency, Dogeverse will operate not only on Ethereum, but also on Polygon, BNB Chain, Solana, Avalanche, and Base.This means it could gain traction on many apps and trading platforms than it would have otherwise, thereby increasing its demand and, in theory, its price.What’s also bullish is that DOGEVERSE has a capped supply of 120 million tokens, with this ceiling potentially making it a deflationary cryptocurrency.And because holders of DOGEVERSE can stake it to earn a passive income, the coin may experience a strong supply squeeze over time.VIDEOThis all helps to explain why DOGEVERSE has been one of the biggest presales of the year so far, with investors able to join in at the official Dogeverse website.1 DOGEVERSE is selling at $0.00031, which is its final sale price, before it lists on platforms and possibly moons.Buy DOGEVERSE Today

$4.9 Trillion Fidelity Pushes for Ethereum Spot ETF Approval


In a significant move, Fidelity, a leading U.S. asset management firm with $4.9 trillion under management, has amended its S-1 application with the SEC for the approval of its spot Ethereum ETF. This adjustment is anticipated to increase the likelihood of approval, with senior ETF analysts now estimating a 75% probability of passage.The latest amendment notably excludes a previously included clause regarding Ethereum staking. Initially, Fidelity's filing indicated that the fund intended to stake a portion of its assets through infrastructure providers. The previous version of the application also highlighted that staking rewards would be treated as taxable income, creating a taxable event for investors without corresponding distributions from the fund.The removal of the staking clause appears to address concerns about these additional risks, simplifying the fund's structure and possibly aligning it more closely with SEC expectations. Industry experts suggest that the complexities and uncertainties associated with staking have been a major hurdle in the approval of spot Ethereum ETFs. By eliminating this aspect, Fidelity might be mitigating perceived regulatory risks, thus enhancing the chances of the ETF's approval.What's wrong with staking ETH?The SEC has shown caution regarding staking, given its potential classification of staked Ethereum (sETH) as a security, which adds another layer of regulatory scrutiny. By excluding staking from its ETF proposal, Fidelity is likely aiming to present a more straightforward product that adheres strictly to the existing regulatory framework for nonstaked assets.Fidelity's push for approval comes at a pivotal time for the cryptocurrency market, which is eager for institutional-grade investment products. The approval of a spot ETH ETF would mark a significant milestone, providing investors with a regulated, accessible means to gain exposure to the major altcoin.

Bitcoin Hits $71K as Ether ETF Hopes Build

ETH has been buoyed by favorable regulatory developments that seem to indicate increasing chances of spot ether ETFs being approved by the SEC after the regulator asked exchanges to update 19b-4 filings, which propose rule changes. As a result, the ether implied volatility curve, which shows market expectations of future volatility across different strike prices and expirations, flattened as 25-delta risk reversals hit year-to-date highs above 18%, and traders heavily bought $4,000 calls for 24 May and 31 May, Presto Research analysts wrote. A Polymarket contract asking if an ether ETF would be approved by May 31 jumped from 10 cents to 55 cents, representing a 55% chance that approval will take place by then.

ERC-7683: Uniswap and Across Protocol's New Standard


Uniswap Labs and Across Protocol have launched ERC-7683, a new Ethereum token standard that promises to simplify cross-chain transactions and interoperability.
The new standard introduces a new way to handle transactions between different blockchains. It creates a common network that connects these blockchains, solving the problem of having different systems that don’t work well together. ERC-7683 also lowers costs and makes the process simpler for everyone involved.
Enhancing Cross-Chain Interoperability

Uniswap Labs has adopted ERC-7683 for cross-chain swaps on UniswapX, enhancing trading across automated market makers (AMM) and other liquidity sources. 

“ERC-7683 proposes that all cross-chain intents follow the same order structure, so that a universal, shared filler network can fulfill transactions,” Across Protocol noted.

Different blockchains manage transactions differently, making it complex and expensive to transfer assets across them. ERC-7683 aims to standardize this process, reducing the need for each blockchain to have its own system. This standardization makes cross-chain interactions more efficient and cost-effective, benefiting users by lowering fees and speeding up transactions.

Uniswap Labs and Across Protocol have shared their proposal on the Ethereum Magicians forum, seeking feedback and further discussions. Following its announcement, Uniswap’s native token, UNI, saw a 2.43% increase in value, trading at $7.79.
ERC-7683 and Its Technical Specifications

ERC-7683 introduces two key features: the CrossChainOrder structure and the ISettlementContract interface. These features create a flexible and unified system for handling trades between different blockchains. The new standard allows developers to customize how transactions are processed while maintaining a consistent framework.
ERC-7683 overview. Source: Uniswap Labs
Launching ERC-7683, Uniswap Labs and Across Protocol address major challenges in cross-chain transactions, such as ensuring there is enough liquidity and making the process user-friendly. By standardizing how transactions are handled, ERC-7683 promotes fair competition among transaction processors (fillers). This leads to better fulfillment of user requests and more successful trades. Overall, ERC-7683 represents a significant step forward in making blockchain technology more efficient and accessible.

Here's The Number of Ethereum Holders in Profit as ETH Surges to $3.8K


																Ethereum’s (ETH) dramatic rally to the $3,700 price zone has put a substantial portion of the cryptocurrency’s holders in profit, boosting their investment returns significantly.
According to a tweet by IntoTheBlock, 90% of market participants holding ETH are currently in profit, while the remaining 10% are at the money. No ETH holder is at a loss, at the time of writing.
90% of ETH Holders in Profit
Monday was an eventful trading day for ETH as the asset rallied 10% in 25 minutes, surging past $3,150 to $3,450. At press time, the crypto asset had risen to $3,790, indicating a 22% increase in the past 24 hours. This significant uptick has put the majority of ETH holders in profit.
Ethereum on-chain indicators witnessed similar dynamics roughly two months ago, shortly after the Dencun upgrade. However, the crypto asset saw a significant plunge at the time. ETH fell more than 11% within a week and settled at $3,500. Regardless, around 89% of the asset’s holders were in profit.
This time, ether is rallying on news of the potential launch of spot Ethereum exchange-traded funds (ETF) in the United States, seeing its highest 24-hour move in a year.




Ether ETFs on the Horizon
Bloomberg ETF analysts Eric Balchunas and James Seyffart increased their odds of Ether ETF approval this month from 25% to 75%, citing input from multiple sources and talks that the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) could be reversing its stance on greenlighting the products.
If Balchunas’s prediction is correct, there could be an influx of filings from potential Ether ETF issuers in the coming days.
Besides the increased odds from the ETF analysts, certain developments in the U.S. government signal a positive trajectory for ether in the short term. The U.S. House and Senate recently passed a resolution to scrap an anti-crypto banking rule previously established by the SEC.
The resolution receiving bipartisan support from both chambers came as a shock because it is widely believed that President Joe Biden’s administration has adopted an anti-crypto stance.
Meanwhile, analysts believe ETH could hit $4,000 in a few days if the ETFs are eventually approved. Such a move could bring the asset closer to breaking its all-time high of $4,891.

USDX: the first stablecoin issuance on the layer-1 Flare

Hex Trust, a leader in the digital asset management and custody sector, recently made headlines by issuing the first stablecoin native on the Layer-1 Flare blockchain. 
Called USDX, this stablecoin is pegged on a 1:1 basis with the US dollar and offers several innovative features that could potentially transform the landscape of digital currency.

Overview of USDX: the first stablecoin on the Layer-1 Hex blockchain
USDX is designed to maintain a stable value by being directly backed by the US dollar or equivalent valuable assets.This approach ensures that USDX maintains a constant value relative to the dollar, making it an attractive option for users seeking stability in the often volatile cryptocurrency markets.The introduction of USDX on the Flare blockchain is particularly notable because it marks one of the first examples of a stablecoin fully integrated into a Layer-1 blockchain solution.
Flare is a Layer-1 blockchain that aims to bring greater scalability, faster transaction speeds, and lower costs to its users. By leveraging the Flare network, Hex Trust can capitalize on these features to offer a more efficient and cost-effective stablecoin experience.Flare’s blockchain is also known for its unique consensus mechanism, which combines elements of the Avalanche and Federated Byzantine Agreement systems. This hybrid model allows for high throughput and low latency, ideal for the needs of modern financial applications.
One of the most convincing aspects of USDX is the opportunity for users to earn a return in the real world. 
Users who stake their USDX on the Flare blockchain are rewarded with cUSDX, a secondary token that represents the staked USDX and accumulates additional gains over time. 
This staking model not only provides an incentive to hold USDX but also helps stabilize the supply and demand dynamics.
The launch of the stablecoin
The concept of yield in the real world is a revolutionary feature in the field of stablecoin. It implies that the returns on USDX staked are linked to assets that generate income outside the world of cryptocurrencies.
This could include returns from debt instruments, dividends from stocks or other financial products. 
By linking staking rewards to real-world assets, Hex Trust and Flare are bridging the gap between traditional finance and cryptocurrencies, offering investors a familiar yet innovative way to interact with digital assets.
The launch of USDX could have significant implications for both retail and institutional investors. For everyday users, the stability and easy convertibility of USDX make it a practical choice for transactions and savings. 
On the other hand, institutional investors may find USDX attractive due to the staking opportunities and integration with a scalable blockchain like Flare, which could handle large transaction volumes at lower costs.
Furthermore, USDX could be used as protection against volatility in other cryptocurrency investments. In times of market turbulence, investors may shift their assets to USDX to preserve value, and then convert them back when conditions stabilize.
Benefits and conclusions
Given that stablecoins have been under increasing scrutiny from regulators around the world, the launch of USDX comes at a critical time. 
Hex Trust’s approach to compliance and security, through its custody and asset management services, can provide a model on how stablecoin can meet regulatory expectations while providing safe and transparent financial services.
Furthermore, by operating on the Flare network, USDX benefits from the enhanced security measures intrinsic to the design of the blockchain.
These features ensure that USDX transactions are not only fast and efficient, but also secure and resistant to various types of cyber threats.
The introduction of USDX by Hex Trust on the Flare blockchain represents a significant milestone in the evolution of digital currencies. 
Combining stability with performance opportunities in the real world, USDX sets a new standard for what stablecoins can offer. 
While the landscape of digital assets continues to evolve, the role of innovations like USDX will be crucial in shaping the future of finance, combining traditional financial principles with the benefits of modern technology.

Dogecoin (DOGE) Breakout: Potential 21% Price Rise Ahead?


Dogecoin’s (DOGE) price is primed to see gains as the recent increase in price has triggered recovery.
The short liquidations observed in the last 24 hours have generally been followed by a rise, which might also be the case this time.
Will Dogecoin Bears Step Back?

Dogecoin’s price rose by 11% in the past day when the entire crypto market rallied, bringing the meme coin to trade at $0.163. This led to the traders who were pining for a price fall losing their money, as evident in the short liquidations worth nearly $7 million.
This is the largest single-day short liquidation in more than two months. Historically, such large liquidations have seen rises in the following days, and the same is anticipated presently. This liquidation may also result in the bears backing off as investors await a rally.

Investors’ optimism is fueled by the $1.28 billion worth of profits they will witness. According to the Global In/Out of the Money (GIOM) indicator, about 7.87 billion DOGE were bought between $0.16 and $0.18.

This supply could turn profitable soon since Dogecoin’s price is exhibiting bullish signs. However, this would warrant a breach of the $0.16 resistance level. Since DOGE holders are close to noting such huge profits, they will likely act accordingly until the altcoin hits $0.18.

This will likely drive the rally.
DOGE Price Prediction: Where Will the Rise Stop?
Dogecoin’s price has moved within an ascending triangle pattern for the past month. The ascending triangle pattern is a bullish continuation pattern characterized by a horizontal resistance line and an upward-sloping trendline. It indicates that buyers are gradually gaining strength, often leading to a breakout above the resistance level.

DOGE is breaking out of this pattern at the time of writing, with volumes declining consistently. However, the pattern will be validated when the meme coin marks a 22% rally to reach $0.20. This crucial price point has been marked as a target per the pattern and also stands as key psychological support.

However, the more practical outcome would be Dogecoin’s price breaching $0.18, making the aforementioned supply profitable.
On the other hand, failure to breach $0.16 could lead to a fallback into the pattern. This would turn the breakout into a fakeout, and further decline could send DOGE to $0.15 or lower. Consequently, the bullish thesis would be invalidated.

Bitcoin surges above $70k again as Bitbot’s presale officially hits $3.5m



                    

                    Key takeaways

BTC is now trading around $71k per coin after adding 6% to its value.
Bitbot’s presale has officially crossed the $3.5 million mark as it draws closer to its end.

Bitcoin hits $71k as it eyes new all-time high
Bitcoin, the world’s leading cryptocurrency by market cap, has been performing well over the past few days. It is up by more than 14% in the last seven days, allowing it to break past the $70k psychological level once again.
At press time, the price of Bitcoin stands at $71,388, up by more than 6% today. The rally comes as the broader crypto market embarks on a recovery. If BTC continues with its recent momentum, it could set a new all-time high in the near term. 
What is Bitbot?
With the crypto market in a bull run, several projects are emerging that seek to make it easier for users to interact with the ecosystem. Bitbot is one of the projects that could change how cryptocurrency traders approach the market.
Bitbot is a Web3 project designed solely for crypto traders. It is a telegram trading bot that allows users to access high-end trading features.
With Bitbot, retail crypto traders can have access to a wide range of cryptocurrency pairs via their cold wallets on Telegram. The trading bot will leverage Telegram thanks to its position as the leading messaging platform for crypto users. 
The team revealed that the tool will provide retail traders with world-class features to help them manage and grow their trading portfolios. 
With the total cryptocurrency market cap now at $2.6 trillion, Bitbot intends to leverage the exceptional growth in trading volume to gain massive adoption in the coming months and years.
Bitbot to offer high-end features to retail traders
While there are several trading tools available to retail traders, Bitbot intends to provide them with high-end features that would allow them to improve how they view the market and trade crypto pairs. 
Bitbot will integrate Knightsafe into its system, allowing it to offer a self-custody solution, eliminating the typical risks associated with Telegram trading. The anti-MEV and anti-rug solutions currently in development will ensure user assets are safe at all times. 
This Telegram trading bot will also come with ultra-flexible wallet management powered by non-custodial API technology to provide an added layer of security to the users.
In addition to that, the Copy Trading feature will be easily available to novice traders. This would allow them to copy the trades of the strongest-performing wallets based on on-chain activities.
Bitbot’s presale surpasses $3.5m
The Bitbot presale is in the 14th stage and has already raised over $3.5 million. The 14th stage will end once the amount raised reaches $3.924 million. 
The presale continues to attract more investors as the crypto market embarks on a recent rally. Currently, the $BITBOT token is going for $0.0189 but is set to increase to $0.02 once the next round commences.
Per the project tokenomics, the development team will hold 20% of the total token supply and will use it to fund ongoing development. 14% of the total token supply has already been allocated to marketing & CEX listings while 3% goes to exchange liquidity provision.

Could $BITBOT rally after listing on exchanges?
The Bitbot presale is only one stage away from completion, after which the team will look to list the token on centralised and decentralised exchanges. The listing could see the token surge higher in the short to long term,
The crypto market has been bullish over the last couple of months and market analysts are expecting a bigger pump in the coming months. If this happens, altcoins could rally higher in the medium to long term. 
Bitbot could be a big winner in the market if it rolls out its products and lists on exchanges. The project is set to take advantage of the growing trading volume in the market to obtain a sizable market share.

Bitcoin short squeeze: $85M in BTC shorts liquidated in 24 hours


    Bitcoin (BTC) experienced a dramatic market shift as its total liquidations surged to $97.06 million, driven by $10.98 million in long positions and a staggering $85.08 million in short positions being wiped out. 



The sudden price increase caused over $260 million in market-wide short liquidations on May 20, the largest since February 28th. Ethereum (ETH) shorts lost over $115 million, followed by Bitcoin shorts at just over $97 million, according to data from Coinglass.



This upheaval occurred as Bitcoin’s price surged around 5% in the past 24 hours, reaching $71,078.15. The cryptocurrency’s 24-hour trading volume also skyrocketed by 138%, valued at $54.065 billion, with a market capitalization of $1.40 trillion.







A short position in Bitcoin derivatives allows investors to magnify their potential gains from a price decline. However, if the price moves in the opposite direction, those positions risk liquidation. 



The largest cryptocurrency’s price surge resulted in significant losses for short sellers, with $85 million in BTC shorts liquidated in just 24 hours, according to CoinGlass.



Expert insights and optimism



Statistician Willy Woo commented that bullish traders were tackling overhead resistance that had been in place for over a month. 



Currently, BTC is trading with the 20-day  exponential moving average (20-EMA) at $64,371 and a positive relative strength index (RSI), indicating that an upward breakout is more likely. 



To add to the optimism, analyst ELI5 of TLDR commented that the majority of on-chain indicators point to a nascent bull market, despite some showing topping patterns.



CoinGlass data indicated $70,600 as the area with the thickest bid liquidity below the spot price at the time of writing.

Market liquidity and exchange reserves



Adding to the bullish sentiment, exchange BTC reserves have plummeted to a seven-year low, with CryptoQuant data showing only 1,9184,152 BTC available on major trading platforms as of May 20, a significant decrease from the previous year.

This reduction in exchange reserves is considered bullish because it indicates that more investors are moving their Bitcoin off exchanges and into personal wallets. 



This behavior suggests that they are holding onto their Bitcoin for the long term, expecting the price to rise. 



When fewer BTC are available on exchanges, it can lead to reduced selling pressure and increased scarcity, potentially driving up the price.



Despite the optimistic outlook, investors must remain cautious with Bitcoin trading. This is due to macroeconomic concerns related to the Fed’s interest rates and microeconomic concerns related to Bitcoin miners’ revenue drop, which affects network security.



While Bitcoin was experiencing notable liquidations, Ethereum also saw significant price action. ETH pumped by 20%, adding to the overall market excitement. 



The movements in both Bitcoin and Ethereum highlight the current volatility in the cryptocurrency market, driven by various factors, including ETF developments and technical market resistance levels.



Nevertheless, cryptocurrencies are highly volatile, and is hard to forecast further performance.

Fidelity Files Amended S-1 Application with SEC for Spot Ether ETF, Removes Staking


                        
                            Fidelity Files Amended S-1 Application with SEC for Spot Ether ETF, Removes Staking

                        Asset manager Fidelity has made an amended S-1 application to the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) for its spot Ether exchange-traded fund (ETF).The updated application specifies that the underlying Ether tokens of the ETF will not be staked, according to recent reports. S-1 filings are mandatory registration forms required by the SEC for launching publicly traded securities products in the United States.SEC Might Greenlight Ether ETFs
This filing comes in the wake of reports suggesting that the SEC has reversed its stance on spot Ether ETFs, potentially influenced by political pressures. As a result, the commission has reportedly requested ETF issuers to revise their 19b-4 filings. The upcoming deadline for the SEC’s decision falls on May 23, specifically for VanEck’s Ether ETF proposal.While senior Bloomberg ETF analyst Eric Balchunas has increased the likelihood of approval to 75%, up from the previous estimation of 25%, this specifically applies to the 19b-4 form.However, approval for Ether ETF issuers also necessitates the acceptance of their S-1 filings, as highlighted by Bloomberg ETF analyst James Seyffart in a recent post.Seyffart indicates that the approval process for S-1 filings could take weeks to months, even if the theoretical approvals for 19b-4 filings occur this week. Despite the potential delay, Seyffart suggests that S-1 approvals are a matter of “When” rather than “If.”The SEC faces final deadlines to make decisions on VanEck and ARK‘s spot Ethereum ETF applications on May 23 and May 24, respectively.Liquidity Concerns Remain
In a recent note, Matteo Greco, a research analyst at digital asset investment firm Fineqia International, added that concerns over the liquidity of ETH’s spot and futures markets, along with its previous classification as a security by the SEC, contribute to skepticism about swift approval.“If rejected, issuers would need to resubmit filings, potentially leading to approval in Q4 2024 or Q1 2025 at best,” the analyst wrote.Greco added that another possible scenario involves the approval of the 19b-4 filings while “slow-playing” the S-1s. The SEC must approve both the 19b-4s and the S-1s for the launch of Spot ETH ETFs.The 19b-4s filing allows national security exchanges like the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) or Nasdaq to list new products, such as Spot ETH ETFs. The S-1s are the initial registration forms required for new securities offered to the public.Notably, fund companies engaged in active dialogue with the SEC and submitted multiple amended versions of paperwork to address the SEC’s concerns prior to the greenlighting of Bitcoin ETFs.However, there has been significantly less activity in this regard for spot Ethereum ETF filings. This lack of public activity has led many to anticipate a disapproval order.“Most people are universally expecting a disapproval order,” Katherine Dowling, general counsel for Bitwise, which filed for a spot-Ether ETF in March, told Bloomberg.“You’re not seeing the types of public activities that you would see if there was going to be an approval.”

Crypto bros upset over Wikipedia’s ‘garbage’ Solana coverage


Crypto bros have branded Wikipedia’s Solana coverage ‘absolute garbage’ and have voiced concerns about Web3 is Going Just Great creator Molly White’s role in editing online articles.
Ethereum researcher Emmanuel Awosika took issue yesterday with Wikipedia’s coverage of the crypto industry on X (formerly Twitter), claiming “Solana manlets are probably the worst hit here.”
“No way I’d be touching [Solana] if Wikipedia was my first source of information (Ethereum, surprisingly, had better coverage). Someone needs to edit that page and spend less time on Twitter ads.”
Awosika also brought up White’s potential involvement in editing crypto-related articles for Wikipedia and her influence on Wikipedia’s decision to reject cryptocurrency donations. “Do non-profits like Wikimedia have a COI policy, too,” he asked.
He then added, “People have complained about Wikipedia’s coverage of the crypto industry, but I never grasped the problem until someone made a ‘Wikipedia Is Going Great’ joke referring to Molly’s potential involvement.”
Molly’s post calling out Awosika’s claims.
In her defense, White noted that her ‘potential involvement’ in the editing of the Solana Wikipedia page amounted to just one grammatical edit — correcting the miscapitalization of ‘non-fungible-token.’ 
She also refuted Awosika’s claim that her Wikipedia editing was ‘news,’ noting that she lists herself as a ‘Wikipedian’ (a volunteer separate from the Wikimedia Foundation that helps edit pages) in her bio.
Awosika tried to claim that Wikipedia has a ‘clear anti-crypto stance,’ highlighting its refusal to accept crypto donations and an alleged history of failing to report on crypto-related subjects. 
White noted, “The Wikimedia foundation doesn’t accept donations of livestock either but somehow we manage to write articles on cows just fine.”

Awosika also shared images of Wikipedia’s Solana page that detail lawsuits, outages, and hacks related to the platform and its suffering due to FTX. He asked White, “Surely, there’s more to a protocol like Solana than just lawsuits, token price crashes, and outages?”
White responded, “I think that most crypto projects (even large ones like Solana) is very limited to industry publications, which generally don’t pass the bar for reliable sourcing on Wikipedia.”
She added, “Wikipedia articles are based on what reliable, secondary sources have to say about a topic, not what a topic has to say about itself.”

Panama City, Panama, May 21st, 2024, Chainwire


Pioneering Bitcoin DeFi developer Velar has announced that it is partnering with BOB (Build on Bitcoin) to support the launch of Velar Artha, the world’s first Perpetual Decentralized Exchange (PerpDex) on Bitlayer’s EVM-compatible Bitcoin Layer 2.
BOB will provide technical support to optimize the development and mainnet launch of Velar Artha, drawing upon its best-in-class developer tooling, analytics, wallets, and blockchain infrastructure. This will accelerate the launch of the PerpDex and ensure that it is anchored by a strong technical foundation.

COTI V2 Developer Network Goes Live, Unveils Privacy-Centric Possibilities


																Web3 infrastructure development firm COTI has unveiled a developer network ahead of its upcoming launch of the privacy-centric Ethereum-based layer-2 network COTI V2.
According to a press release sent to CryptoPotato, the COTI V2 developer network has gone live, introducing a novel layer of confidentiality and advanced garbled protocols to the blockchain.
COTI V2 Devnet Goes Live
The developer network will enable market participants to explore several web3 use cases, including confidential decentralized finance (DeFi), on-chain sensitive data management, confidential machine learning and artificial intelligence, Dynamic Decentralized Identification, and confidential transactions for payments, stablecoins, and real-world assets.
The COTI V2 devnet provides several tools for development teams, including a Python SDK, a faucet to cover gas for on-chain activity, a NodeJS SDK, server access, extensive documentation, and an explorer for on-chain analytics.
COTI designed the network to enable experimentation with new smart contracts using COTI V2. The web3 infrastructure development company claims developers can use the network to build one of the best techniques within multi-party computation for securing private information.




COTI Unveils $52M Grant Program For Devs
To spur developers to build on the devnet, the COTI Foundation has unveiled a new grant program to reward builders for their contribution. The foundation has set aside 400 million COTI, worth roughly $52 million at current prices, from the token’s existing supply as it looks to incentivize groups to explore new use cases and the range of opportunities a privacy-centric web3 ecosystem can provide.
The COTI foundation dubbed the grant the ABC Growth Fund for ambassadors, builders, and creators on the devnet. The program seeks applications from innovative builders, developers, and researchers interested in testing the limits of the COTI ecosystem’s capacity.
COTI CEO Shahaf Bar-Geffen said: “We’re opening our doors to the world with the COTI V2 Developer Network, and with our Builders program, we’re inviting teams around the world to take part in COTI V2’s developer network and share what you’re building. We have an incredible year ahead of building new things, making new partners, and growing COTI’s network.”
COTI is commencing the builders program of the ABC Growth Fund, which has a four-tiered structure in order to have an ascending impact on the ecosystem. Developers interested in the program are required to submit their applications to create proofs of concept (POCs) for privacy-preserving smart contracts, tools, and products.

    Velar, a Bitcoin (BTC) decentralized finance (DeFi) platform, has announced a partnership with Build on Bitcoin (BOB) supporting the launch of Velar Artha, the world’s first Perpetual Decentralized Exchange (PerpDex) on Bitlayer’s EVM-compatible Bitcoin Layer 2, as per the information shared with Finbold on May 21.



The collaboration aims to expedite the launch of the PerpDex, ensuring a robust technical foundation.



Bringing DEXs to Bitcoin Layer 2

The decentralized exchange will debut on Bitlayer, a Bitcoin Layer 2 that supports the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM). 



As an initial strategic partner, BOB will play a crucial role in overseeing the platform’s security, decentralization, and user experience.



BOB will streamline the development and mainnet launch of Velar Artha, utilizing its top-tier developer tools, analytics, wallets, and blockchain infrastructure. 



Velar CEO Mithil Thakore emphasized the significance of the partnership, stating:

We’re excited to pioneer this journey together, pushing the boundaries of Bitcoin DeFi and delivering value to the Bitcoin community.”




Perpetual swaps on Velar Artha



Velar Artha will empower Bitcoin users to perform perpetual swaps for assets, including BTC, and to open leveraged long and short positions.

Solana-Based Wallet Phantom Buys Web3 Specialist Bitski

“In the future, we think embedded wallets really make sense for decentralized applications, rather than being forced to build their own or use less trusted firms or experimental products,” said Wu in an interview. “With Bitski's expertise in embedded wallets, onboarding will be much easier. Instead of telling people to download a separate mobile app, and adopt a seed phrase, simply sign up with an email and get started immediately.”

Web3 Marketing Startup Spindl Launches On-Chain Ad Network

"It's more transparent. It's fair. It's natively on-chain. It's, to be blunt, better for privacy," said Garcia Martinez, CEO of Spindl, whose core service is attribution. "We're not using weird, sketchy Web2 data," such as consumers' browsing history or their personal information, to target campaigns – just on-chain transactions, which are already public.

Strong Gains for Injective (INJ): Key Price Levels to Observe


Injective (INJ) has demonstrated a strong 24-hour performance, gaining 17% in the last 24 hours. 
This surge raises the question: Can INJ recover from the 65% drawdown from its all-time high?
Injective Technical Analysis: Testing Key Levels
The Injective price has approached or tested the daily Ichimoku cloud, which is a very bullish sign. The size of the cloud highlights the significance of this level. 

INJ/USDT Daily Price Action. Source: TradingView
Key resistance levels in the mid-to-long term are $29.5, $34, $38.4, and $43. If the daily Ichimoku cloud breaks on INJ, it could witness a price appreciation toward $33. Additionally, if Bitcoin’s price reaches back to $73,000, the price could easily increase by another 18% in the mid-term.
Correlation with Bitcoin: INJ has shown a notable correlation with Bitcoin, standing at 0.6. This suggests that movements in Bitcoin’s price significantly impact INJ. If Bitcoin continues its upward movement and reaches $73,000, we can expect INJ to trade between $30 and $34.

On-Chain Metrics: Validating Price Appreciation
On-chain activity indicates that the price appreciation is genuine, with notable spikes in key metrics:

Active Addresses Rising: The number of active addresses has been increasing, which is a positive indicator of network activity and engagement.

Large Transactions Decline: The number of large transactions has been declining noticeably, which can be beneficial for the coin’s stability. Decreasing large transactions can reduce volatility and make the market less susceptible to sudden, large-scale sell-offs, leading to a more stable price and a less risky investment environment.

Strategic Recommendations and Price Projections
Bullish to Neutral Outlook:

Target Level at $29.5: If the price enters the daily Ichimoku cloud, the initial target is $29.5. This level serves as a significant resistance.
Major Price Appreciation: A break above $29.5 could trigger major price appreciation, with potential targets at $34, $38.4, and potentially reclaiming $40.
Downside Risk: If the price tests the lower boundary of the Ichimoku cloud and fails to hold, it could lead to an exit to the downside, negating the bullish probability and leading to further declines.

SEC asks updated spot Ethereum ETF filings from US exchanges: Report - Crypto Briefing


            
            
                            
            
                            
            
            The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) reportedly asked exchanges that would list spot Ethereum (ETH) exchange-traded funds (ETF) in the US to update their filings, said Joseph Edwards, head of research at Enigma Securities, to Reuters.“Opposing the ETH ETF after the BTC one was approved always seemed like an odd case for the SEC to try to push, unless they were willing to open up questions on Ethereum’s securities status more broadly, and it’s likely that the call has come in somewhere to not take that fight,” added Edwards.To Reuters, an SEC spokesperson said they did not comment on individual filings.On May 20, Bloomberg ETF analysts Eric Balchunas and James Seyffart raised the odds of a spot Ethereum ETF approval from 25% to 75%, mentioning that the US regulator is motivated by “political issues.”This development was enough to raise ETH’s price by 22.5% in the last 24 hours and also propelled the crypto market as a whole.The SEC has two decisions on spot Ethereum ETFs this week related to filings from VanEck and ARK Investment Management. As it happened with spot Bitcoin ETFs in the US, analysts expect a blanket approval, which means that if the regulator gives the green light, all spot Ethereum ETFs will have permission to be traded in the country.Close to an all-time highBitcoin raised 96% within two months before its first spot ETF approval in the US and registered different all-time highs in the two following months after the SEC permitted this investment product trading.At the time of writing, Ethereum is 23% away from its all-time high of $4,878.26, according to data aggregator DefiLlama. If a similar move ensues, ETH might hit a new price peak at the beginning of Q3.However, due to the market expectations around the Ethereum ETF, a refusal from the SEC might have a significantly negative impact on the crypto market.

Ethereum ($ETH) Price Soars Nearly 20% as Crypto Market Cap Surges by $200 Billion | Cryptoglobe


                                
The price of the flagship cryptocurrency Bitcoin ($BTC) has surged past the $71,000 mark in a cryptocurrency market rally that saw Ethereum’s Ether, the second-largest cryptocurrency, skyrocket nearly 20% while the total market cap of the space grew by over $200 billion.



The sudden move came as Bitcoin broke through the $65,000 mark earlier this week after being range-bound after its highly-anticipated halving event, which cut the coinbase reward miners receive per block found in half.



The rally extended to several other major cryptocurrencies, with Binance’s BNB moving up 7.7% in the last 24 hours, XRP moving up 5.5%, and DOGE moving up nearly 8% over the same period, among others.



Total Crypto Market Cap Chart via TradingView



The catalyst for the broader market surge appears to be news related to the potential approval of spot Ether exchange-traded funds (ETFs) in the U.S as the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has abruptly requested that the exchanges that want to list and trade these funds update key filings related to these products, fueling speculation that the regulator is considering approving these products.







            
            

            
            

            
            

        

Before any trading can begin, issuers of spot Ether ETFs must receive the go-ahead on their S-1 registration statements, with the SEC having no set deadline to review these filings.



The SEC’s ongoing investigation into Ether, the native cryptocurrency of the Ethereum blockchain, has intensified over the last few months, especially after the network’s transition to a Proof-of-Stake protocol.



Should Ether be classified as a security, it could provide the SEC with a basis to deny the applications for spot Ether ETFs.

House Democrats Challenge Bill on Digital Asset Regulation


							

Maxine Waters and David Scott have opposed the FIT21 crypto bill.



The lawmakers emailed their colleagues to explain their reason for opposing the bill.



They believe FIT21 will shield crypto entities from‌ securities laws, rules, and regulations.




Two senior House Democrats, Representatives Maxine Waters and David Scott, have voiced opposition to the Financial Innovation and Technology for the 21st Century Act (FIT21). In emails to fellow Democrats, they expressed concerns that the bill could disrupt existing regulations and weaken investor protections. However, a report by Politico noted they did not whip their members against the bill.



The FIT21 Act aims to establish a regulatory framework for digital assets by clarifying how these assets are classified and overseen. It proposes expanding the authority of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) in regulating certain digital assets.



However, Reps. Waters and Scott argue that the bill undermines established legal principles and creates uncertainty within the traditional securities market. A portion of their email states:




“This language undermines decades of legal precedent and case law, creating uncertainty in our traditional securities market.”




The lawmakers further point to a section of the bill that allows entities to file an “intent to register” under specific conditions. They believe this could shield such entities from existing securities regulations while the SEC and CFTC develop new rules.









According to the email, the ranking lawmakers fear that the new bill will weaken investor protection and open the door to fraud and market manipulation. They consider it a “not fit for purpose act.”



Proponents of the bill, including a coalition of industry organizations and companies such as Coinbase and Andreessen Horowitz, argue that FIT21 provides much-needed regulatory clarity for the digital asset industry.

This Is Why Ethereum Meme Coins Are Soaring: PEPE, MOG Lead


The anticipation surrounding the potential approval of spot Ethereum (ETH) exchange-traded funds (ETFs) in the US has triggered a remarkable surge in Ethereum-based meme coins. 
Over the past 24 hours, several tokens within the Ethereum ecosystem have experienced significant gains, fueled by heightened investor interest and optimism.
Pepe and Mogcoin Skyrocket

Ethereum meme coins, often viewed as high-risk, high-reward assets, have become a popular way to bet on the network’s growth. They are considered a leveraged bet during Ethereum rallies. 
This phenomenon was observed recently when two Bloomberg analysts increased the likelihood of ETH ETF approval. Consequently, the Ethereum ecosystem tokens surged.

Pepe (PEPE), one of the most notable Ethereum meme coins, is trading near its all-time high, soaring over 17% in just 24 hours. PEPE is known for its volatility and potential for outsized gains, making it a favorite among speculative investors.
Another standout performer is Mogcoin (MOG), which has skyrocketed by nearly 45% over the same period. Amid these developments, the story of mogillionaire.eth, an Ethereum Naming Service (ENS) address, has captivated the crypto community. 
In July 2023, mogillionaire.eth invested 8.8 ETH, equivalent to $16,000 at the time, to acquire 3.37 trillion MOG tokens. 

“Fortunately, 7 months later, his dream came true, and he became a millionaire on Feb 27, 2024. The 3.37 trillion MOG was worth more than $4 million at the peak and is currently worth $2.83 million,” on-chain analysis platform Lookonchain said.

While PEPE and MOG have grabbed headlines with their impressive gains, other Ethereum-based tokens have also performed well. Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Floki (FLOKI), though not matching the explosive growth of PEPE and MOG, have still posted increases of nearly 7% and 10%, respectively.

The surge extends beyond meme coins. Arbitrum (ARB), another Ethereum-based token, has climbed by 25%. 
Additionally, Lido DAO (LDO) has seen a remarkable 33% increase. These gains reflect a broader bullish sentiment within the Ethereum ecosystem, driven by the potential ETF approval and the network’s ongoing development.

Hong Kong-based Crypto Custody Hex Trust Announces the Release of a New Stablecoin! Here are the Details - Bitcoin Sistemi

Hex Trust Group, a leading crypto custodian based in Hong Kong, has launched USDX, the first native stablecoin on the layer-1 blockchain Flare.
Hex Trust Releases First Native Stablecoin on Layer-1 Blockchain Flare
This stablecoin is backed 1:1 by US dollars or equivalent assets and can be staked on the Flare blockchain.


The launch of USDX is set to enhance decentralized finance (DeFi) activities on Flare by providing new opportunities for users and developers.
The stablecoin will be integrated into various lending protocols and exchanges and will also have a staking mechanism in a private T-Pool created by Clearpool, a decentralized lending marketplace.





Users who stake USDX will receive cUSDX in return, which can be used as collateral in DeFi protocols on the Flare network. This integration aims to provide a stable, yield-generating asset for the Flare ecosystem.
“USDX and Clearpool's collaboration on Flare delivers a stable asset with 1:1 backing that provides instant access to real-world returns,” said Hugo Philion, co-founder of Flare.


This will be particularly useful for FAsset brokers and will work even when their stable collateral is locked in the system,” he said.

Alessio Quaglini, CEO of Hex Trust, highlighted the benefits of USDX, stating that it will help “reduce volatility in the cryptocurrency market” and “facilitate transactions.”





The launch of USDX marks a significant milestone for Flare as it continues to develop its DeFi capabilities.
Earlier this year, Flare raised $35 million in a private financing round from investors including Kenetic and Aves Lair. According to DeFiLlama, the blockchain currently has a total value locked (TVL) of $8 million.
This new development underscores Flare's commitment to expanding its ecosystem and providing robust financial tools for its users. With the launch of USDX, Flare is poised to attract more participants and significantly increase DeFi activity.

Standard Chartered anticipates spot Ethereum ETFs approval this week - CoinJournal



                    

                    
Standard Chartered expects SEC approval of Ethereum ETFs this week.
The bank predicted inflows of $15-45 billion that could drive ETH price to $8,000 by the end of 2024.
Ether’s price has surged 19% in the past 24 hours, reflecting the optimism in the market.

Standard Chartered expects the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to approve Ethereum (ETH) ETFs this week.
If it happens, it could herald a substantial influx of capital into the ether market, with projections estimating inflows between $15 billion and $45 billion in the first 12 months post-approval.
The critical ether ETFs proposal deadlines
The SEC is approaching critical deadlines for several ether ETF proposals, with VanEck’s submission due on May 23 and Ark Invest/21Shares’ on May 24.
Geoff Kendrick, Head of FX Research and Digital Assets Research at Standard Chartered, stated that the approval of spot ether ETFs could drive significant market activity, with anticipated inflows ranging from 2.39 million to 9.15 million ether.
Kendrick emphasized that these inflows, as a percentage of market capitalization, are comparable to those seen with bitcoin ETFs, which have proven to be accurate predictors of market behaviour.
Ethereum (ETH) price forecasts
In light of this, Standard Chartered has reiterated its ambitious price target for Ethereum (ETH), forecasting it to reach $8,000 by the end of 2024. This projection is based on maintaining the current 5.4% price ratio between ether and bitcoin, with bitcoin itself expected to hit $150,000 by year-end.
The bank’s outlook extends even further, predicting that by the end of 2025, Ethereum (ETH) price could soar to $14,000, assuming Bitcoin reaches a staggering $200,000.
These optimistic targets underscore the potential impact that ETF approvals could have on the broader cryptocurrency market.
SEC requested updates to the 19b-4 spot Ethereum ETFs filings
The momentum towards approval gained additional support on Monday when the SEC requested updates to the 19b-4 filings for spot ether ETFs.
This move suggests progress, albeit without guaranteeing approval. However, the likelihood of approval has been bolstered significantly.
As a result of the SEC’s move, Bloomberg ETF analysts James Seyffart and Eric Balchunas increased their approval probability estimates from 25% to 75%.

Update: @JSeyff and I are increasing our odds of spot Ether ETF approval to 75% (up from 25%), hearing chatter this afternoon that SEC could be doing a 180 on this (increasingly political issue), so now everyone scrambling (like us everyone else assumed they'd be denied). See… https://t.co/gcxgYHz3om
— Eric Balchunas (@EricBalchunas) May 20, 2024

Reflecting the growing optimism, Ethereum’s price surged over 19% in the past 24 hours, reaching $3,782.68 as of 12:28 P.m. ET on May 21.
The broader cryptocurrency market also reacted positively, with the GM 30 Index, which tracks the top 30 cryptocurrencies, rising by 9.25% to 148.75.

Shiba Inu Breaks Out Of Bull Flag Pattern-Like, Signaling Uptrend


																In a noteworthy development for Shiba Inu investors and traders, well-known cryptocurrency analyst and enthusiast Javon Marks has verified SHIB’s break out from the Bull Flag pattern, an indicator that typically signals the start of an upward price movement.
Shiba Inu Breakout To Trigger A Continuation 210% Price Increase
Mark’s emphasis delves into the current bullish momentum surrounding Shiba Inu, which has caused traders and investors in the meme coin market to feel optimistic once again, indicating that the crypto asset could be positioned for more gains.

	Related Reading



According to the expert, SHIB has now exited a smaller Bull Flag-like pattern, and it is currently holding above it. This breakout appears to be significant as Javon Marks noted that it could start another major wave in an already enormous run on the upside.

Specifically, this lesser break can trigger a continuation in an over 210% (3X) run to $0.000081 from the $0.0000254 level, provided that the larger breakout also holds. In addition, should Shiba Inu surpass the $0.000081 level, it might be poised for an additional 90% increase to the $0.0001553 mark.
The post read:
With a larger breakout also holding, this smaller break can initiate a continuation in an over 210% run to the $0.000081 target which is more than 3X from here. A break above $0.000081 and SHIB may just be set for another +90% move to $0.0001553.
The analyst further drew attention to his previous forecasts, in which he predicted a run to the $0.000081 price level. He previously noted that Shiba Inu has made a strong comeback and appears to be primed for yet another huge surge towards the $0.000081 target.
Thus, given the progressive breakout from the resisting trend, another 141% upside move to hit the aforementioned price target may not be far off. Also, following price declines, SHIB will garner strength to reach the level and move even higher to $0.0001553.
Pullbacks To Buttress The Move
Javon Mark affirms that since SHIB’s break out from the resisting trend, it has increased by over 129%, suggesting that a run is well within reach. At this point, Marks claims that as long as current prices maintain their breakout, pullbacks might only enhance these prices. Additionally, an extra 252% price increase toward $0.000081 will be aided by these pullbacks.

It is important to note that the analyst’s prediction began when SHIB ended a 441-day downtrend in September last year. Given the significance of the development, Marks believed SHIB was about to surge, putting his target at $0.000081, a 975% rise from $0.0000074.
As of the time of writing, Shiba Inu was trading at $0.0000257, demonstrating over 6% growth in the past day. Both its market cap and trading volume have also attracted significant gains of about 6.83% and 147%, respectively.

Monster whale activity to watch for these 2 cryptocurrencies


    The cryptocurrency market has started this week dominated by a bullish sentiment, with most cryptocurrencies accruing gains. This recent price action has attracted the interest of crypto whales, reaching short-term record highs.



In particular, an insight from Santiment shows Optimism (OP) and Chiliz (CHZ) with rising whale activity on May 20. However, despite a seemingly positive metric, Santiment‘s analyst, Brian Q, believes this could foreshadow volatility and trend reversals.




“With crypto rebounding big today, keep an eye on the rising whale activity among many altcoins like Optimism and Chiliz. Sudden high onchain activity among their largest traders typically will foreshadow major volatility and OP & CHZ reversals.”
– Brian Q, for Santiment








Notably, the chart shows 392 and 46 whale transaction counts for OP and CHZ, respectively. This category includes all transactions worth $100,000 or more registered on the Ethereum (ETH) and Optimism networks.

How does whale activity correlate to price?



Essentially, cryptocurrencies moving on the blockchain usually means one of these three things:



One, someone has purchased these amounts in a cryptocurrency exchange, withdrawing to a self-custody wallet. Two, Someone wants to sell these amounts and is depositing to an exchange for that intent. Or, three, someone is making a wallet-to-wallet transaction either for themselves or for someone else.



However, the first two are the most common activities— buying or selling, while withdrawing or depositing.



On that note, withdrawing activity is retroactive, meaning the whale has already bought the tokens and influenced their price. Meanwhile, if spotted in time, depositing can forecast further price impacts as the assets are yet to be sold.



Therefore, high whale activity could sometimes foreshadow volatility and reversals, although not guaranteed.



Optimism (OP) and Chiliz (CHZ) price analysis



As of this writing, OP was trading at $2.92 per token, up nearly 20% in a month, while CHZ was trading at $0.124, up 7.6% in the same period.

Notably, Optimism is currently testing a price resistance in the monthly chart, while CHZ has broken out of resistance in the weekly chart and heading toward key zones in the higher time frame.



This suggests that, if Santiment’s analyst is right, these assets could experience increased volatility and likely retrace at any moment. Nevertheless, the market is unpredictable, and everything can happen in the short term for these cryptocurrencies.

Web3 Gaming Token GALA Crashes After $240M Exploit - The Defiant

The price of GALA dropped 20% to $0.038 from $0.047 on Tuesday morning.
Gala Games, a popular web3 gaming network, is reeling after a hacker breached its smart contracts and minted a massive sum of GALA tokens.The attack triggered a 20% plunge in the price of GALA to $0.038 from roughly $0.047, according to CoinGecko.A hacker exploited the smart contract for the GALA token and minted tokens worth $240 million.While the attacker was able to sell roughly 600 million tokens worth $21 million via the decentralized exchange Uniswap, Gala Games moved quickly to freeze the remaining 4.4 billion GALA.Rogue Admin"Our ETH contract for $GALA is secure and under the protection of a multi-sig wallet,” Gala CEO Eric Schiermeyer said . “It was never compromised."Schiermeyer also took responsibility for the incident, stating that Gala had made mistakes with its internal control.“This shouldn’t have happened, and we are taking steps to ensure it doesn’t happen again," he said.The breach was first identified by Solidity developer 0xQuit.“A compromised or rogue Gala Games admin address minted 5 Billion $GALA ($200M) and has been systematically selling the tokens for the past 2 hours,” they tweeted.Hacker IdentifiedGala Games’ CEO noted the project has identified the culprit and are currently working with authorities.Regarding daily distribution, Schiermeyer said there will be a vote to decide how to handle this matter, emphasizing that the community will decide how they proceed.In this context, "daily distribution" refers to the regular release of GALA tokens to network participants, such as node operators and users, as rewards for their contributions.Schiermeyer noted that the frozen 4.4 billion tokens can be considered "effectively burned," meaning they cannot be transferred or accessed and are therefore considered destroyed.The price of GALA has since rebounded to around $0.041. This recovery is partly due to a broader market rally, with Ethereum experiencing a 20% surge.Dominant in GameFiGala Games holds a dominant position in the GameFi ecosystem on Ethereum, capturing over 60% of the user base according to data from Dune Analytics. In comparison, The Sandbox follows with 25% of the users, and Axie Infinity comes in third with 11%.Gala Games has a 60-person team and boasts more than 1.3 million active users worldwide, according to a CoinMarketCap 2021 research report. Some popular titles within the Gala Games ecosystem include Mirandus, Spider Tank, Town Star, Fortified, and Echoes of Empire.The GALA token is integral to the Gala Games ecosystem, serving as a medium for in-game purchases, rewarding node operators, and enabling governance through voting on platform decisions.

How Bitcoin ETFs Are Changing the Risk-Reward Ratio for Institutional Investors

Prior to FTX, a lot of people put those risks aside and focus on price appreciation and gaining access to the market. Post FTX, people are saying, I want to be involved, but I need to know I'm protected at a basic level. The ETFs do that, while exposing institutional investors to the reliant counterparties in crypto. They’ve put the industry back on a positive track.

Sui Sets New Standard for Blockchain Transaction Speeds



                    
Grand Cayman, Cayman Islands, May 21st, 2024, Chainwire


Set to hit Mainnet this summer, Sui’s new Mysticeti protocol cuts consensus latency down to 390 ms.
Sui, the pioneering Layer 1 blockchain that offers industry-leading performance and infinite horizontal scaling, today announced the successful deployment of Mysticeti, its latest consensus protocol, on Sui Testnet. This significant breakthrough reduces consensus time on Sui’s public Testnet by 80 percent at 390 milliseconds while maintaining the protocol’s industry-leading throughput. This impressive demonstration confirms that Sui is the fastest consensus layer in the industry.
Developed from deep research into Byzantine fault tolerance (BFT) consensus mechanisms, Mysticeti represents a significant advancement from Narwhal-Bullshark, the consensus algorithms Sui launched into its Mainnet a year ago, achieving unprecedented transaction speeds and reducing CPU requirements for validators. This enhancement extends Sui’s impressive low latency performance to all transaction types across the network.
Sui’s uniquely object-oriented architecture enables the network to process transactions differently based on the characteristics of the transaction and the objects involved. On Sui, transactions involving only “owned objects”, such as peer-to-peer transfers, do not require consensus. Instead, they follow a fast-path execution that can be completed in a shorter time. In contrast, transactions involving the same shared object, for example, transactions involving marketplaces, auctions or collaborative game assets, do require consensus. In the past, that meant more processing latencies. Mysticeti changes that, by processing shared object transactions using an optimized version of BFT consensus. The Mysticeti design involves minimal cross-validator communication and fully takes advantage of network bandwidth in order to maintain high throughput.
“Mysticeti represents a major leap forward, not just for Sui but for blockchain technology as a whole,” said George Danezis, Co-founder and Chief Scientist of Mysten Labs which originated the Sui Network and pioneer of global research on BFT consensus. “It reduces consensus latency to what we understand to be its lower limits while retaining the benefits of high capacity and low computation cost. It also allows transaction processing faster than consensus within the same protocol, a feature unique to Sui. Mysticeti is yet another instance of Sui pushing the boundaries of what blockchain technology can achieve.”
Results on Testnet have been remarkable, demonstrating the capability to commit transactions with an 80% reduction in latency compared to Narwhal. The enhancement implemented by Mysticeti significantly decreases complexity and optimizes resource use, allowing the Sui network to handle tens of thousands of transactions per second with latencies well below one second.
These advancements are critical as Sui continues to cement its position at the pinnacle of blockchain speed and scale, and provide a seamless experience for developers and users at scale. 
“Mysticeti’s launch is the result of a successful collaboration between research, engineering, and our validator community,” said Dmitri Perelman, Head of Engineering at Mysten Labs. “The lessons we learned from building and tuning previous-generation consensus in production provided the context and inspiration for the researchers to come up with the new protocol. After the first Mysticeti prototype demonstrated undeniable performance superiority, the engineering team was fully onboard and the next-gen consensus implementation is being rolled out to Mainnet with the support of validators in a matter of months.”
Kevin Nelson, Co-Founder of Aftermath Finance said, “With Mysticeti, Mysten has proven that the DAG-based structure can surpass state-of-the-art performance in both consensus throughput and, importantly, latency. At Aftermath, we are excited to see Mysticeti roll out on testnet and even more excited for when it will touch the hands of our users with its release on Mainnet. Moreover, we are looking forward to taking advantage of Mysticeti’s new design to provide a better end-to-end experience on Aftermath.”
Greg Siourounis, Sui Foundation Managing Director added, “Low latency and fast transaction speeds have always been fundamental to Sui’s value as a top choice for builders, and with Mysticeti, the developer experience gets even better. This breakthrough once again showcases an ongoing and relentless focus on innovation, unlocking new possibilities for the types and quality of decentralized applications that can be built on Sui.”
The key innovations of Mysticeti are detailed in the newly published paper, “Mysticeti: Low-Latency DAG Consensus with Fast Commit Path,” which shows the scalability of this new technology and is available for review.

‘Nvidia of crypto’ targets $20 ahead of earnings call


    With the majority of assets in the cryptocurrency sphere recording a bullish streak, things are looking up for one specific artificial intelligence (AI) token, popularly known as the ‘Nvidia of crypto’ as well, which is eyeing significant gains as an important earnings call awaits.



Specifically, Render (RNDR), often referred to as the ‘Nvidia of crypto’ due to its specialization and explosive growth similar to that of Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA), is targeting $20, according to the observations shared by pseudonymous crypto analyst D0c Crypto in an X post on May 21.



Render price prediction 2024



Indeed, the crypto expert also pointed out that Render’s stochastic relative strength index (RSI) is demonstrating oversold conditions “on the weekly,” adding that Nvidia’s first-quarter fiscal 2025 earnings report, which many expect to be exceedingly positive, is launching on May 22, possibly triggering the “AI season 3.0.”

Render price analysis



For now, Renders is changing hands at the price of $11.04, suggesting an increase of 8.16% in the last 24 hours, as well as an 8.57% advance across the previous seven days, as it accumulates a gain of 23.45% on its monthly chart, according to the latest data on May 21.

Notably, Nvidia has long positioned itself as the leading provider of graphics processing units (GPUs), while the Render crypto asset belongs to a decentralized GPU network aiming to disrupt the rapidly growing market for 3D rendering in virtual worlds, augmented reality (AR), and the metaverse.



Ultimately, thanks to its mission and continuous efforts, the ‘Nvidia of crypto’ might, indeed, proceed towards its next price target at $20 and continue beyond, but caution is necessary, and doing one’s own research is critical when investing, as things in the cryptoverse can sometimes change on a whim.

Angel investor and entrepreneur Anthony Pompliano, who is also a renowned Bitcoin supporter, has published a tweet about his take on the impact that an approval of the Ethereum ETF is likely to have.In the meantime, according to a recent report, the odds of the regulator approving spot Ethereum ETFs have increased to 75%. Still, not all cryptocurrency influencers expect these ETFs to get the green light."The last dam to be broken" for cryptoProminent Bitcoin advocate Pompliano, who holds BTC and has launched several business projects in the crypto space, tweeted that if the SEC decides to issue a positive decision on the spot Ethereum ETF after all, in that case they will be “approving the entire industry.”After spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds got approved in January after many months of waiting, he pointed out that the potential approval of the ETFs based on Ethereum is “the last dam to be broken” for the crypto space to be entirely embraced by Wall Street. Several companies, including Ark Invest, BlackRock, VanEck and Grayscale (who wants to convert their Ethereum Trust into a spot ETF), filed submissions for spot funds based on Ethereum after their Bitcoin ETFs were allowed to start trading.Many crypto influencers have been watching this situation. They have split into those who believe the SEC will approve the ETFs and those who do not believe it will happen this year. Dogecoin cofounder Billy Markus belongs to the latter. On Monday, he shared his take on the X platform. Odds of ETFs approval surge high, Ethereum soarsAccording to a recent tweet published by the Santiment on-chain data aggregator, Bloomberg analysts have made another assessment of the Ethereum ETF situation and have published a positive outcome. Now, per the report, chances for the spot ETFs to be allowed to launch have increased to 75% after staying at 25%.This has provoked the immediate growth of Ethereum, pushing the second-largest cryptocurrency on the market above the $3,650 level for the first time since April 9. At the time of writing this, Ethereum is changing hands at $3,735 upon demonstrating a whopping 20.7% price jump. Still, there is also a risk that the SEC may label Ethereum a security.

Crypto Experts Predict New ETH Price Targets With Ethereum ETF Approval News


This article was paid for*
The Ethereum price is undergoing a significant bullish repricing, following the dramatic surge in the odds of spot Ethereum ETF approval on Monday. 
Bloomberg ETF analysts James Seyffart and Eric Balchunas backtracked from their pessimistic outlook, now projecting a 75% likelihood that the SEC will greenlight the spot ETH ETFs on May 23rd. 

In response, the Ethereum price printed its biggest green candle ever, rallying 20% to trade above $3,700.

Experts project ETH to continue its bullish trajectory, both before and after a potential spot ETF approval. 
Why Spot Ethereum ETF Approval is Now a Strong Possibility?
Most crypto market participants have been caught unawares with the sudden turn of events in the spot Ethereum ETF approval saga. 
Even with BlackRock being one of the applicants, the market had fully priced in a rejection from the SEC, with ETH trading as low as $2,880 last Tuesday. 
Bloomberg ETF analyst James Seyffart remained decidedly pessimistic just 3 days ago, stating on X, “It’s just not happening guys. Sorry”. Meanwhile, his colleague Eric Balchunas called the measured optimism from Coinbase a “risk-free PR move”.

However, there may have been a few indications regarding this oncoming shift in expectations. For instance, on-chain analyst Ali Martinez reported that crypto whales purchased over $341 million worth of ETH in 24 hours. 

Such conviction could have indicated two possibilities – either the whales believed that the spot Ethereum ETF rejection is fully priced in or that the SEC may surprise investors with an approval. 
Balchunas and Seyffart have since bumped the odds up to 75%, citing the fact that spot Ethereum ETF approval has become an increasingly political issue. 
Indeed, other experts have highlighted that a rejection from the SEC would not bode well for US President Joe Biden in an election year, given Donald Trump’s openly pro-crypto stance. 
Crypto Experts Predict New ETH Price Targets
The market had largely expected the SEC to reject all spot ETH ETF applications, resulting in Ethereum adopting a bearish stance.
The second largest cryptocurrency is now repricing, with experts projecting it to continue its bullish trajectory in the coming weeks. 
Analyst Miles Deutscher expects Ethereum to trade near the $6,500 mark, considering that the Bitcoin price rallied over 75% after its spot ETF approval. 

However, crypto influencer That Martini Guy projects ETH to hit $10,000 in the aftermath of spot Ethereum ETF approval.

Analyst Nebraskangooner highlights that ETH has broken out of a bullish cup and handle pattern, with a long-term price target of over $11,000. 
Ethereum Meme Coins Set to Explode
Meme coins remain highly correlated to their respective native tokens during this bull cycle. Experts are already gearing up for Ethereum meme coins to explode next once the spot ETH ETFs are approved. 
For instance, analysts such as Michael Wrubel and Jacob Bury believe that WienerAI – a new ERC-20 meme coin – has 100x upside potential and could be one of the best crypto to invest in 2024. 

$WAI is no ordinary meme coin. As the name suggests, the token offers cutting-edge AI utility, allowing its token holders to gain an edge in crypto trading. From MEV protection to enabling seamless swap, the WienerAI trading bot is designed to be the perfect companion for investors, especially during a bull market. 
$WAI has its own staking pool as well, which has a current reward rate of 400%,
It’s therefore not surprising that the WienerAI presale has already raised close to $2.5 million in the first few weeks. 
Interested buyers can still visit the wienerdog.ai presale website and utilize the over-the-counter widget to purchase the meme coin.

Hex Trust launches USDX, the first native stablecoin on Flare, backed 1:1 by USD.
USDX can be staked in Clearpool’s T-Pool for real-world yield without lock-ups.
USDX aims to enhance Flare’s DeFi ecosystem, supporting lending and borrowing.

Hong Kong-based digital asset custodian, Hex Trust Group, has launched USDX, the first native stablecoin on the Flare network.
The move by Hex Trust Group will bolster the decentralized finance (DeFi) ecosystem on Flare, a layer-1 blockchain tailored for data-intensive applications.
USDX stablecoin by HT Digital Assets
USDX, developed by HT Digital Assets, Hex Trust’s tokenization ecosystem, is a stablecoin backed 1:1 against the U.S. dollar or equivalently valued assets.
The stablecoin’s reserves primarily consist of 1-3 month Treasury Bills, held securely by regulated tier-1 financial institutions, ensuring stability and trust in the stablecoin’s value.
The stablecoin is designed to serve as a fundamental building block for DeFi on the Flare blockchain. It will be available for various applications, such as lending and borrowing protocols, as well as perpetual futures exchanges.
USDX’s integration with Clearpool
While launching the USDX stablecoin, Hex Trust Group also announced a strategic partnership with Clearpool, a decentralized credit marketplace.
Through this collaboration, USDX holders can stake their tokens in a dedicated T-Pool created by Clearpool.
This innovative staking mechanism allows users to earn real-world yields without the constraints of lock-up periods.
In return for staking USDX, users receive cUSDX tokens, which can be utilized as collateral across DeFi protocols on the Flare network, including Flare Labs’ FAsset system. This system supports the use of non-smart contract assets like Bitcoin (BTC) and Dogecoin (DOGE) in DeFi applications.
Market impact and future prospects
Hex Trust’s CEO, Alessio Quaglini, emphasized that the launch of USDX will reduce cryptocurrency market volatility and streamline transactions. He highlighted that USDX bridges the gap between traditional financial security and blockchain innovation, enhancing trust and security within the digital asset ecosystem.
In addition, Hugo Philion, the Co-Founder of Flare, remarked on the essential role of stablecoins in developing a vibrant DeFi ecosystem and noted that the collaboration between USDX and Clearpool on Flare delivers a stable, yield-generating asset that will greatly benefit the network’s users.
Jakob Kronbichler, the CEO & Co-founder of Clearpool, also weighed in on the launch stating that the launch of a custom T-Pool for USDX on Flare provides everyday users with opportunities to earn real-world yield from their stable holdings.
