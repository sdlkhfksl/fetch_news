Here's why you should closely watch these 2 cryptocurrencies


The overall cryptocurrency market is experiencing sustained short-term buying pressure, with most digital assets endeavoring to recover from recent losses. While Bitcoin (BTC) garners much attention as it aims to reclaim the $65,000 resistance, altcoins are also attracting significant interest.
In light of this, Finbold has identified two cryptocurrencies worthy of monitoring. These cryptocurrencies are notably influenced by significant on-chain developments and metrics, which will likely impact their prices amid the prevailing bullish sentiments.
Solana (SOL)
Following the ongoing rally, Solana (SOL) aims to surpass the crucial $150 resistance zone, which is pivotal in achieving another record-high price. Undoubtedly, the decentralized finance (DeFi) platform continues to be the activity center.


It’s worth noting that Solana previously experienced a rally, fueled in part by the growing interest in meme coins launched on the platform. Currently, meme coins are gaining attention again, making Solana a noteworthy asset to watch.
To recap, meme coins on Solana, including Dogwifhat (WIF) and Bonk Inu (BONK), gained prominence as they sought to compete with established players like Shiba Inu (SHIB). However, the spotlight on dog-themed meme coins appears to wane, with a new class of themed around cats emerging. Recent activity surrounding cat-themed tokens has contributed to the SOL price spike.
For instance, Solana-based Popcat (POPCAT) experienced double-digit gains on May 2, skyrocketing by over fivefold in just two weeks. It will be intriguing to observe whether more cat-themed tokens can replicate the performance of their dog-themed counterparts and potentially influence the value of SOL.
Furthermore, the Solana network has seen a notable increase in its locked value, reaching $4.013 billion at the time of writing, according to DefiLlama data. This figure marks a growth of over 160% in 2024.

The escalating TVL indicates expanding user engagement and confidence in the platform and heightened liquidity and trading volume within the protocol. 
By press time, Solana was trading at $147, gaining almost 4% in the last 24 hours. Over the past week, SOL has been up over 7%.

Shiba Inu (SHIB)
In the short term, Shiba Inu stands out among cryptocurrencies with notable gains, surging by over 10% in the last 24 hours. Beyond the overall bullish sentiment in the market, SHIB appears to benefit from factors such as increased trading activity, token burns, and ongoing network developments.
Of particular interest is the network development, which could be the main driver behind SHIB’s price movements. Shiba Inu’s layer-2 blockchain solution, Shibarium, underwent a successful hard fork. This upgrade addresses user concerns regarding network usability and transaction efficiency, which are crucial factors supporting SHIB’s price growth.
The development seeks to promote faster transaction speeds by reducing processing times on the Shibarium network. Additionally, it introduces a system for predictable gas fees, making transactions more cost-effective. Security is also prioritized, with enhancements implemented to safeguard user assets and bolster network security.
Furthermore, crypto analyst Ali Martinez highlighted technical indicators suggesting that SHIB was forming a bull flag, indicating a potential bullish breakout. Martinez suggested that the formation could propel SHIB to $0.000072323, representing a growth of almost 180%.

As of the latest update, SHIB is valued at $0.000026, having rallied almost 6% in the last seven days.

In summary, it’s worth noting that besides the underlying fundamentals, the two cryptocurrencies will likely be influenced by the overall market sentiment.

Along with the increased network activity, Dogecoin's price has skyrocketed, jumping by 13% within 24 hours.In a tweet, IntoTheBlock reported that Dogecoin activity was spiking with the number of new Dogecoin addresses increasing sharply this week. It said that 28,000 addresses were created on May 2 alone, a 102% increase from the monthly low set on Monday. On-chain data also highlights the growth in non-empty addresses for Dogecoin. Santiment, an on-chain analytics startup, revealed a 27% increase in Dogecoin non-empty wallets over the last six months, totaling 6.6 million wallets.This spike in non-empty wallets could indicate renewed interest and engagement in the Dogecoin community.Dogecoin's price has risen by 13% in the previous 24 hours as a result of increasing demand and favorable sentiment towards the cryptocurrency. This price surge demonstrates the impact of network growth on the value of Dogecoin, as increased adoption is frequently correlated with upward price momentum.The Dogecoin price increase coincides with the general crypto market comeback following the release of weaker-than-expected job data. Cryptocurrencies rebounded on Friday, headed by Bitcoin's (BTC) rise, raising expectations that the worst of the fall may be over.The U.S. economy added 175,000 jobs in April, falling short of the expert estimate of 245,000 and the previous month's 315,000 increase. The latest Nonfarm Payrolls data also showed that the jobless rate increased to 3.9% from 3.8% in March.Dogecoin posted a sharp rise consequently, extending its recovery from its May 1 lows of $0.1198.

Gaming needs tokenization - Blockworks


Imagine spending countless hours upgrading your race car in your favorite game, fine-tuning every detail and unlocking new features as you play to make it both beautiful and blazingly fast…only to lose it forever when you stop playing the game. 
What if you could truly own and monetize your in-game creations? Enter the world of tokenized user-generated content (UGC).
Throughout history, humans have prized self-expression and individuality. And in the gaming sphere, this desire has reached new heights with the rise of UGC. Games like Roblox and Minecraft — which average hundreds of millions of players monthly — have revolutionized the industry by empowering players to create worlds, characters, and experiences.
Yet, one key aspect is missing in the majority of these types of games: true ownership. 
While players can create and share content, they have little control over how it’s used or monetized. They spend hours making worlds and upgrading in-game items that add massive value for a studio, driving player retention and enjoyment, without benefiting from the rewards. 
Think about it. The average Fortnite player spends a whopping ten hours a week playing, and some of the most popular builds in the game are player-created. Epic Games (its creator) is directly benefiting from the time these players put into playing and building in the game.
How can we address this challenge and empower players with real ownership and fairer rewards for their creations? 
Tokenization offers a transformative solution.
By representing in-game assets as unique non-fungible tokens (NFTs) on the blockchain, players can assert ownership rights and track their creations’ provenance securely. Smart contracts can automate royalty payments, ensuring fair compensation for player contributions. 
To demonstrate this further, imagine if my daughter’s Lego car creation was tokenized. By creating a digital token or NFT of the car, she can formally certify it as her own and earn rewards when it’s traded. She could even receive royalties if someone used her car in their own game. Tokenization makes this possible in the digital realm.
The billion-dollar opportunity
Deloitte predicts that UGC gaming platforms will pay out nearly $1.5 billion to content developers in 2024. But to realize tokenized UGC’s full potential, we must address negative perceptions surrounding blockchain technology in gaming.
To begin, we need to address the user experience issue. Many early blockchain games suffered from clunky interfaces, complicated wallet setups and a lack of intuitive design. Layer this with exploitative microtransactions (think Axie Infinity), and it’s no surprise mainstream gamers were left wary. 
Imagine a gamer having to manually manage private keys or decipher cryptographic hash functions just to play. That’s a surefire way to deter adoption. 
Instead, the focus should be on creating immersive worlds where the blockchain functions invisibly in the background, enabling ownership and monetization without compromising the gaming experience.
The NFT market has also been prone to wild speculation, with some assets selling for eye-popping sums while others go to zero. While this has generated buzz, it has also led to concerns about market stability and the potential for bubble-like behavior. 
For tokenized UGC to gain mainstream acceptance, it’s crucial to foster a more stable, sustainable market driven by the inherent utility and value of the assets rather than mere speculation. This means designing in-game economies with balanced incentives, sinks and faucets to ensure long-term viability. By shifting the focus from speculation to utility, we can build trust and stability in the market.
Read more from our opinion section: Memecoin mania can teach us something
As more games embrace tokenized UGC, blockchain networks will need to handle a massive influx of transactions. If the infrastructure can’t scale to meet demand, we risk congestion, high fees and a degraded gaming experience. 
We want to avoid another Crypto Kitties-style Ethereum network breakdown. To prevent this, developers must choose scalable blockchain architectures that can grow with their player base. This may involve using layer-1 solutions that can bridgelessly connect to other blockchains, sharding or other techniques to increase throughput without sacrificing decentralization or security. It’s also crucial to optimize smart contracts and game logic to minimize unnecessary transactions and reduce the load on the network. 
One of the most important prospects of tokenized gaming is the ability for a users’ in-game assets to move seamlessly between different game worlds. Imagine being able to take your hard-earned sword from one game and use it in another, or having your spaceship navigate through various universes. This level of interoperability would unlock incredible possibilities for player expression and engagement.
The road to mainstream adoption
Achieving this vision requires overcoming significant technical and coordination challenges. Different games may use different blockchain networks, token standards and data models. Bridging these gaps requires robust cross-chain communication protocols and standardized metadata formats.
It will take a concerted effort from developers, players and the wider blockchain community. But if we get it right, the future of gaming will be a more open, collaborative and rewarding space for all.
And we’re on the right track. Over the past two decades, the UGC gaming landscape has undergone rapid transformation, with what once seemed improbable now on the brink of becoming commonplace, thanks to the integration of blockchain technology. 
Tokenization is the catalyst for creating this billion-dollar gamer-driven economy, where players have unprecedented control over their creations. 
The ownership revolution is here; it’s up to us to seize it.

Optimism's Superchain is a $6 billion hit - What does that mean for OP? - AMBCrypto



Optimism Superchain collected massive amounts of revenue for the protocol over the last few weeks
Despite the protocol’s performance, interest in the OP token tanked

Despite the growing competition in the Layer 2 sector, Optimism[OP] has continued to exhibit growth across various fronts.
Super chain brings in the dough
One of the reasons for the same is the Optimism Superchain. Optimism Superchain recently become a magnet for capital, attracting over $6 billion in deposits from Ethereum L1. This surge in popularity can be further underlined by the fact that assets bridged to the Superchain account for a significant portion – 25%, of the total value locked (TVL) bridged from Ethereum L1.
For context, the Optimism Superchain is like a collection of L2s. It bundles multiple L2s together, both technologically and economically. This combined approach offers several advantages, including streamlined operations and potential cost efficiencies.
As an incentive for participating in the Superchain, Optimism furnishes developers with access to a valuable toolkit, the OP Stack & Governance framework. This common set of tools simplifies development and streamlines governance processes for L2s within the Superchain.
In April 2024, Base demonstrated its commitment to the Superchain by paying $1.86 million in Superchain membership fees to Optimism. This financial contribution helps to ensure the ongoing development and maintenance of the Superchain.
Source: X
However, there were some concerns that arose when it was seen that Base had a higher number of monthly active users than the OP mainnet. In fact, Token Terminal’s data indicated that despite having a higher number of monthly active users, Base doesn’t necessarily undermine OP Mainnet’s position within the Optimism Superchain.
OP Mainnet can retain its role as the Superchain’s Hub by providing a shared governance framework for all member chains. Strong performance by individual member chains, like Base, can be beneficial for the entire ecosystem. This, because high-performing chains contribute more fees back to OP, further supporting the Superchain’s development.
How is OP doing?
Despite Optimism network’s progress, overall interest in the OP token declined. Additionally, the price of OP has fallen by 5.59% in just 24 hours. At press time, OP was trading at $2.96. The volume at which OP was trading also fell by 22.75%.

 Realistic or not, here’s OP market cap in BTC’s terms

Also, network growth around the OP token declined significantly, indicating that the number of new addresses showing interest in OP fell.
If the waning interest from new addresses continues, the price of OP could see a correction in the near future.

Jack Dorsey makes $21m commitment to Bitcoin and open source | Cryptopolitan

Jack Dorsey, the guy behind Twitter, just threw a massive $21 million towards OpenSats. This money is meant for pushing forward with open source and Bitcoin development. As we all know, Dorsey is big on Bitcoin, seeing it as a revolutionary financial instrument. I mean:“Bitcoin changes absolutely everything. I don’t think there is anything more important in my lifetime to work on.“Jack DorseyOpenSats said they got this cash in May 2023. It’s part of Dorsey’s giving nature through his #startsmall thing, which had already put $10 million into their coffers for similar projects, including something called Nostr, which is all about decentralized social media. Money Where It MattersThe breakdown of this $21 million Dorsey donation is pretty strategic: $15 million is going straight into the General Fund, another $5 million is earmarked for The Nostr Fund, and a cool $1 million is for operational costs. This isn’t just throwing money around; it’s about fuelling ongoing and new stuff that makes a difference in the Bitcoin space and the broader arena of tech that lets people do what they want without interference.Recently, Nostr got a huge boost. We’re talking about integrating Bitcoin payments for developers, which has sparked a user surge to 16 million, with 500,000 folks logging in daily. That’s not small potatoes.With all this cash flooding in, OpenSats didn’t just sit on it. They’ve brought in new brains and brawn to their committee and board. Now, there’s a user named @Fiatjaf and another, NVK, who are eyeing future projects. NVK, along with Gigi, is also stepping up on the board. This squad is about creating a space where open-source software can thrive, keeping digital big brother at bay, as OpenSats put it—they’re fighting “digital totalitarianism.”A Look at Past EffortsOpenSats isn’t new to this game. They’ve been backing projects that sync with their mission to beef up the Bitcoin ecosystem and other open-source ventures. Before this latest cash infusion, they had already supported 21 teams, like the Bitcoin Policy Institute and the BTCPay Server, which is a DIY payment processor. They’ve handed out nearly $10 million in grants to over 100 grantees.This time around, Dorsey’s money is also setting aside some for legal defense funds, helping Bitcoin developers who might get into legal scraps over their work. While they’re keeping the details under wraps, it’s clear that Dorsey’s backing isn’t about the money, but rather having the backs of those in the trenches of Bitcoin development.It’s not just Dorsey who’s into OpenSats. The group has been pulling in donations from the public and other philanthropic bodies. The Reynolds Foundation also kicked in $1 million last month. OpenSats is all about getting more folks to chip in, helping push high-impact projects across the tech world.So here’s the deal. Last year, Dorsey already handed over $10 million to OpenSats, and now, with another $21 million, he’s keeping his position as a major player in the movement towards more open, free tech infrastructure.OpenSats has a lot on its plate, but with financial injections like these and a clear focus on impactful projects, they’re set to keep the momentum going. Remember, this is about shaping a future where technology enhances freedom rather than restricts it. Dorsey and OpenSats are on a mission to make sure that future comes to pass, with Bitcoin right in the middle of it.

2 Reasons Why Polygon (MATIC) Could Enter a Bull Rally


Polygon (MATIC) price awaits strong bullish cues that could propel the altcoin out of the consolidation it is currently stuck in.
Given that the altcoin is among the lowest profit-bearing assets, it is likely that investors will push for a price rise to book profits.
Polygon Investors Hint at Accumulation
MATIC price could see a breakout above the $0.74 barrier if only investors act accordingly. As long as these MATIC holders refrain from selling, consolidation could continue, and accumulation could enable an upswing.
This is the likely outcome for MATIC’s price, which is observing a surge in buying pressures. The supply held on the exchanges has seen a 20 million MATIC decline in the last three days. Although compared to other values and market capitalization of the altcoin, this supply is not much, it is a testament to the investors’ sentiment.

In the past, such instances of buying have been followed by short-term price spikes. If MATIC price witnesses the same outcome this time, it could invalidate the consolidation.
MATIC Exchange Supply. Source: Santiment
Less than 34% of the entire circulating supply of MATIC is in profits, which is relatively uncommon. Despite the recent corrections, at least 50% of most of the cryptocurrency supply is in profit.
This suggests that Polygon investors are likely desperate for profits, which could keep them from selling their holdings. Since MATIC has considerable room to grow, it could also witness extended bullishness.

MATIC Supply in Profit. Source: Santiment

MATIC Price Prediction: Reclaim $0.80 
MATIC price is consolidated between $0.74 and $0.64. This range has been unbroken on both ends for the past three weeks. Since mid-April, the Polygon native token has attempted multiple times to breach the upper limit, acting as resistance. 
Now, the altcoin is close to doing the same this time around. A push from Polygon investors’ accumulation could help MATIC breach $0.74, pushing it towards $0.80. Successfully flipping the resistance of $0.81 would initiate a recovery rally.

On the other hand, if the breach fails, MATIC’s price could remain rangebound and slip back down to $0.64. Losing this support could send the altcoin to $0.60 and lower, invalidating the bullish outlook.

Ripple's XRP Can Avoid Another Price Dip Under One Condition


Ripple (XRP) price recovery rally largely depends on the broader crypto market and the investors’ behavior.
However, neither party favors a price rise, which could cause considerable damage to XRP holders.
Ripple Investors Take a Step Back
XRP price attempts to move upward, but by the looks of it, this effort will be thwarted. This is because Ripple is noting bearishness at the hands of its investors, particularly traders.
Bearish bets against XRP have increased in the futures market, which is evident from the funding rate. 

The funding rate in cryptocurrency futures trading is the fee paid or received by traders holding leveraged positions overnight. Market conditions determine it and serve to balance the market between long and short positions. Generally, positive funding rates suggest the dominance of long contracts, whereas negative rates hint at short contracts’ taking the preference. 
XRP is witnessing negative funding rates, which suggests traders are betting on a price decline.

At the same time, the broader market is also exhibiting bearishness, as can be seen in the Relative Strength Index (RSI). The RSI is a momentum oscillator that measures the speed and change of price movement. It is used to identify overbought or oversold conditions in an asset.
Given that XRP is struggling to secure the neutral line at 50 as support, a bearish outcome seems rather likely.

XRP Price Prediction: Another Dip
XRP price trading at $0.51 notes a potential breakout of the symmetrical triangle pattern in effect since early April. 
A symmetrical triangle pattern is a technical analysis formation characterized by converging trendlines. It indicates a period of consolidation before a potential breakout. It typically signifies indecision in the market and can lead to a bullish or bearish move. 
Considering the aforementioned conditions, the chances are that the XRP price could face a bearish move, which could bring it down to $0.47. Falling through this support will extend the losses by a mile toward $0.42.

On the other hand, flipping $0.51 into a support floor can represent a significant milestone. Indeed, it will enable the altcoin to invalidate the bearish thesis and allow the XRP price to eventually secure a 27% rally to hit the target of $0.65, as derived from the triangle pattern.

Michael Saylor warns these popular cryptocurrencies will be deemed securities


Michael Saylor, founder of MicroStrategy (NASDAQ: MSTR) and a prominent Bitcoin (BTC) advocate, recently stated that the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) is likely to classify major cryptocurrencies like Ethereum (ETH) as securities, not commodities. He anticipates that this classification will result in the denial of all spot Ethereum ETF applications this summer.
Saylor’s comments extended beyond Ethereum, predicting a similar future for other prominent cryptocurrencies such as Binance Coin (BNB), Solana (SOL), Ripple (XRP), and Cardano (ADA). This announcement was made during his speech at the MicroStrategy World 2024 conference on Thursday.

“Ethereum is deemed to be a crypto asset security, not a commodity. After that, you’re gonna see that Ethereum, BNB, Solana, Ripple, Cardano, everything down the stack is just crypto-asset securities unregistered”



Michael Saylor on BNB, SOL, and XRP ETFs
His remarks reflect a broader skepticism about the potential for these assets to gain mainstream financial products such as spot ETFs, which are often seen as a bridge to institutional investment. 
“None of these tokens will ever be wrapped by a spot ETF, none of them will be accepted by Wall Street, none of them will be accepted by mainstream institutional investors as crypto assets,” Saylor added.
Contrasting sharply with his views on Ethereum and others, Saylor reaffirmed Bitcoin’s status as the premier cryptocurrency, uniquely recognized as an institutional-grade asset.
According to Saylor, Bitcoin stands as the “one universal” crypto asset that has achieved full institutional acceptance. This distinction highlights the potential for Bitcoin to remain largely unaffected by the regulatory challenges that might beset other cryptocurrencies.
Diminishing prospects for Ethereum ETF
The prospects for an Ethereum ETF are currently bleak, as evidenced by recent developments and expert opinions. 
Justin Sun, the CEO of Tron (TRX), voiced a similar sentiment regarding the challenges ahead for Ethereum’s acceptance by regulators, emphasizing the need for “long-term education with regulators.” 

This aligns with the cautious stance of the SEC, which recently postponed its decision on Franklin Templeton’s proposed spot Ethereum ETF to June 11, 2024.
James Seyffart, an analyst from Bloomberg Intelligence, also indicated skepticism, noting that the current batch of Ether ETF applications might ultimately be rejected.
The public comment period initiated by the SEC in April, seeking opinions on proposals from various firms, including Bitwise Ethereum Trust and Fidelity Ethereum Fund, further underscores the regulatory uncertainties surrounding Ethereum.
Despite the prevailing pessimistic outlook, some industry figures like Larry Fink, CEO of BlackRock, remain optimistic. Fink suggested that an Ethereum ETF might still be feasible even if ETH is classified as a security, with BlackRock actively exploring the possibility of launching such a product.

The forthcoming SEC decision on May 23, which includes considerations for VanEck’s ETF proposal among others, will be crucial in determining the future landscape for Ethereum and potentially setting a precedent for how other cryptocurrencies are perceived and regulated.

Why Shiba Inu (SHIB) Price May Drop This Weekend


Shiba Inu (SHIB) is threatened to note a decline due to the lack of recovery observed in the broader market cues.
SHIB investors are not keenly bullish either, which could translate into losses for the meme coin.
Shiba Inu Whales Are a Problem
Shiba Inu’s price could experience a price correction due to the waning support from SHIB holders. These meme coin enthusiasts have been losing optimism toward a rally, which is visible in their increasing selling pressure.
In the last two months, the addresses holding more than $1 million and $10 million worth of SHIB have sold off a huge chunk of their supply. Nearly $10 billion worth of SHIB has left their wallets, creating a bearish impact on the meme coin.

Such major selling tends to counter any potential an asset has at rallying, which could be the case with Shiba Inu.

Furthermore, the correlation this meme coin shares with Bitcoin also threatens its gains. SHIB shares a high correlation of 0.81 with BTC. A high correlation indicates a strong statistical relationship between the two assets. This implies that changes in one of them are closely associated with changes in the other.
Given Bitcoin is the bigger asset and is also noting bearish cues, it is difficult to predict a bullish outcome for Shiba Inu. Thus, there is a good chance that the meme coin could have a bearish weekend.

SHIB Price Prediction: Support Could Fail
Shiba Inu’s price has been trading under a downward trendline for the most part since the beginning of March. Even though the meme coin attempted breakouts in the past, it failed to retain the rally.
Consequently, SHIB is now threatened to fail the breach of the downtrend line and fall back to $0.00002093. Losing this support would result in a significant correction to $0.00001491.

Shina Inu must print a daily candlestick close above $0.00002584 to invalidate the bearish thesis. Such upward movement could break the descending trendline SHIB has maintained since March and push prices toward $0.00002835 or higher.

Is the lack of liquidity in Bitcoin futures threatening price stability? | Cryptopolitan

Bitcoin surged to $64,500 on May 4, with out-of-hours trading pushing it to new local highs of $64,522 on Bitstamp. This marked a significant recovery for the cryptocurrency, hitting its peak for May.Daily Market MovementsData from TradingView confirmed the spike, which rode on positive U.S. employment data and signals of crypto market recovery, notably the first cash inflows into the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) in almost three months. Currently, Bitcoin’s price is up 5% for the month, starkly contrasting with a 15% drop experienced in April, according to CoinGlass.On Twitter, popular trader Daan Crypto Trades shared, “Had a great push into the market close yesterday.” He added, “I like how the charts are on the higher timeframes, but I’ll be patient and won’t start buying just because it’s green this weekend. We’ll see how it goes.”This weekend’s market did show some unexpected moves. There was a notable difference between the Bitcoin prices on spot markets and the closing prices of Bitcoin futures by CME Group, revealing a “gap” that tends to close later.Source: Daan CryptoMarket VulnerabilitiesHowever, some market watchers are skeptical about the rally’s strength, pointing out the lack of traditional finance (TradFi) involvement. Keith Alan from Material Indicators commented on the fragility of the market due to thin liquidity in the order books. “We need more bid liquidity to sustain this rally,” he said, warning that “it wouldn’t take much to trigger a sell-off through this thin liquidity.”Credible Crypto, another prominent voice, noted that the market setup might favor short sellers under certain conditions. “If we stay below the main resistance around $69,000, going short could be a good strategy,” he mentioned in a post, sharing a chart that predicted two potential paths for Bitcoin’s price.“The ideal path is we keep the gains we’ve made and push towards major resistance. That lets me set up shorts for several altcoins. The less ideal path is we drop these gains early, and I miss the short zones I’m watching,” he explained.Credible Crypto also pointed out that buying opportunities could arise if Bitcoin falls below $56,000, indicating a strategy to capitalize on potential dips.Institutional Engagement in BitcoinThe ongoing submissions of 13F filings are shedding light on institutional interest in Bitcoin ETFs. Institutions managing over $100 million must disclose their quarterly holdings, and these filings have shown varied levels of engagement.BNY Mellon reported owning nearly 20,000 shares of the IBIT and about 7,000 shares of GBTC. In contrast, BNP Paribas holds around 1,000 shares of IBIT, indicating a more cautious stance.More aggressive positions are seen in smaller firms. Pittsburgh-based Quattro Advisors owns 468,200 shares of BlackRock’s ETF, while Legacy Wealth Management disclosed ownership of over 350,000 shares of Fidelity’s ETF. A significant stakeholder is Yong Rong, holding over a million shares of BlackRock’s ETF, making it a major part of their portfolio.Bloomberg’s Eric Balchunas highlighted that Yong Rong is among several Hong Kong asset managers heavily investing in Bitcoin ETFs, including Fidelity, Grayscale, and Bitwise, alongside IBIT.

Bitcoin Surges Past $64,000 as Altcoins Seek Recovery Amidst Weekend Momentum



                    

Bitcoin surged past $64,000 before the weekly close on April 28, while altcoins aimed for a rebound. Data from Cointelegraph Markets Pro and TradingView showed increased momentum in Bitcoin’s price over the weekend. 



After hitting a weekly low of $62,400, BTC/USD reversed its course and maintained levels around $63,500 at the time of reporting. 




Altcoins also saw positive performance during off-hours trading, with the total altcoin market cap rising by approximately 1% for the day.



Popular trader Skew, commenting on recent market trends, noted the bounce in altcoins but expressed caution regarding their tendency to peak early in the week. 



Skew anticipated sell-side pressure on Bitcoin around its range highs, which could hinder further bullish advances.




Trader and commentator Moustache expressed optimism about an upcoming “altseason,” suggesting it could rival the market’s performance during the 2017 all-time highs.

He pointed to the monthly dominance chart of the stablecoin Tether, indicating a potential “backtest” after breaking below a rising trendline earlier in the year.



Market participants awaited the introduction of “TradFi” trading, such as Bitcoin futures, for additional insights into the crypto market’s trajectory. 




Fellow trader Daan Crypto Trades shared positive sentiments about weekend price action, anticipating limited movement in Bitcoin until after the reopening of CME.



Despite consolidating below previous all-time highs, Bitcoin’s monthly chart drew optimism from trader Alan Tardigrade. 



Tardigrade highlighted Bitcoin’s position above the Triangle Top on the monthly chart as a bullish indicator, emphasizing the necessity of consolidation for a sustained bull run in the future. 



He compared Bitcoin’s current situation to the pre-breakout period of the Nasdaq Composite Index in 2013, suggesting potential for significant growth ahead.

Short squeeze alert for May: 2 cryptocurrencies with skyrocketing potential


The cryptocurrency market shifted from bearish to bullish as the week ended, following nonfarm payroll data reported on May 3. After days of continuous short-selling pressure, some cryptocurrencies display skyrocketing potential within the possibility of a short squeeze.
Notably, TradingView‘s total crypto market cap index surged by over $277 billion month-to-date from a local bottom on May 1. On May 4, the index reached a $2.318 trillion capitalization local high, up over 13% in three days.

However, previous fear, uncertainty, and doubt (FUD) led cryptocurrency traders to massively short Bitcoin (BTC) and other cryptocurrencies. Thus, this increases the likelihood of short-squeeze events for BTC and targets higher prices, as reported by Finbold on May 3.


In addition, Finbold spotted two cryptocurrencies in a similar situation, with negative funding rates and accumulated short-position liquidations.
Short squeeze alert for BNB Chain (BNB)
The BNB Chain’s (BNB) current funding rate is the leading signal for a potential short squeeze to Binance‘s native token. We retrieved this data on May 4 from the CoinGlass 30-day funding rate heatmap.
In particular, BNB short-sellers are paying a 32.63% APR for long-position traders, which could fuel short liquidations. The BNB Chain has the sixth-largest open interest in the derivatives market, increasing this signal’s relevancy.
Funding Rate Heatmap: BNB, 30-day, ordered by Open Interest. Source: CoinGlass
As for the price targets, BNB has short-position liquidity pools from $600 to $630, currently trading slightly below this level.

Bitcoin Cash (BCH)
Bitcoin Cash (BCH) has an even higher negative funding rate of 35.96%, the 10th-largest cryptocurrency ordered by open interest.
Funding Rate Heatmap: BCH, 30-day, ordered by Open Interest. Source: CoinGlass
While BCH’s liquidity pools are less concentrated than BNB’s, the coin’s current price is far below the pending liquidations. Interestingly, there are unbalances in a large range from $500 to above $700. This offers a skyrocketing potential that could result in over 40% gains if Bitcoin Cash suffers a short squeeze.

However, despite the above economic analysis, these cryptocurrencies could still display negative price performance in the next few days. Short squeeze technical indicators do not guarantee the event will happen. Things can quickly change as the market moves, so investors must remain cautious.

Here Are The Top 10 Altcoin Networks With The Most Users In April - Ethereum Ranks 6th - Bitcoin Sistemi


While the cryptocurrency market rose led by Bitcoin after the weak employment report from the USA, analysis company CryptoRank identified the altcoin networks with the highest number of users in April.
Bitcoin price has increased by approximately 7% in the last 24 hours and is traded at $ 63,257 at the time of writing this article.


Here are the altcoin networks with the most users and their number of users in April:

Tron (TRX) – 54.7 million
Near (NEAR) – 53.8 million
BNB (BNB) – 35.5 million
Solana (SOL) – 35.2 million
Polygon (MATIC) – 33.6 million
Ethereum (ETH) 12 million
Base – 10.7 million
zkSync Era – 9.8 million
Arbitrum (ARB) – 9.3 million
Linea – 5.6 million
Celo (CELO) – 4.9 million
Optimism (OP) – 4.2 million
Aptos (APT) – 3.2 million
Scroll – 2.6 million
Blast – 2.5 million


It is noteworthy that Ethereum, which has the largest market value, can rank sixth on the list. The reason why Ethereum's number of users remains lower than others is the high transaction fees required by the network to process transactions.





However, it is thought that the reason why Tron, which ranks first, has such a large number of users is that most of the USDT stablecoin transfers occur on the Tron network.

BTC-e crypto exchange operator pleads guilty to money laundering in the U.S.

Alexander Vinnik, a Russian national who operated the crypto exchange BTC-e, pled guilty to charges of money laundering conspiracy in the US on May 3, according to a Bloomberg report.BTC-e was one of the world’s largest crypto exchanges between 2011 and 2017. According to the prosecutors, it processed transactions worth $9 billion and had a customer base of over 1 million worldwide.The prosecutors added that BTC-e was used by cyber criminals to transfer, launder, and store criminal proceeds from illegal activities. This included proceeds from hacking, ransomware, and narcotics distribution.According to a statement by the US Attorney’s office in San Francisco, Vinnik operated the exchange until he was arrested and BTC-e was shut down by law enforcement. Vinnik, sentenced to five years imprisonment for money laundering in France in 2020, faces a maximum of 20 years in prison in the U.S.The statement noted:“Vinnik operated BTC-e with the intent to promote these unlawful activities and was responsible for a loss amount of at least $121 million.”Prosecutors claim that BTC-e did not have a vetting system and allowed criminals to convert illicit cash into cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin anonymously. The prosecutors stated that the exchange was found to have handled Bitcoin traced to a Russian military intelligence hacking unit that was responsible for releasing Democrats’ emails during the 2016 U.S. elections in an attempt to sway votes.In recent months, there has been increasing scrutiny and regulatory action against cryptocurrency-related fraud in the U.S. Sam Bankman-Fried, the co-founder of now-defunct crypto exchange FTX, was sentenced to 24 years in prison in March for orchestrating a multi-billion dollar fraud scheme.Additionally, Do Kwon, the founder of Terraform Labs, was found liable for fraud in a civil case in April 2024. Terraform Labs collapsed in 2022, triggering a chain of bankruptcies and wiping out $40 billion from the market.More recently, Changpeng Zhao (CZ), the founder of Binance, one of the world’s largest crypto exchanges, was sentenced to four months in prison this week for failures that allowed illicit activities, including criminal and terrorist financing, to occur on the platform. CZ had previously pled guilty while Binance paid the biggest fine in history and agreed to being monitored.Furthermore, Former SEC Division of Enforcement Assistant Director Jennifer Lee said this week that if Donald Trump is elected President for a second term this year, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) will continue to “define its space and reach over crypto.”Mentioned in this article

Bitcoin Price Prediction
Bitcoin’s price shows a robust ascent, now trading at approximately $63,200, with recent highs of $64,446. This activity is part of a wider trend that has seen the global crypto market cap increase to $2.36 trillion, up over 7% over the last day.
The uptick is influenced by the Federal Reserve’s decision, as indicated by Chair Jerome Powell, to halt further interest rate increases, a policy move that often favors investments like Bitcoin by enhancing their appeal.
The surge is also supported by significant inflows into Bitcoin ETFs and the successful launch of similar products in Hong Kong, highlighting a renewed and growing confidence among investors.
The combination of these factors indicates a possible increase in the price of Bitcoin.





Bitcoin ETFs See $378M Inflows, Marking Market Confidence Resurgence

Bitcoin ETFs have recently witnessed a notable surge in inflows, totaling $378 million on May 3, marking a recovery after a week of outflows.
This influx includes a significant $63 million investment in Grayscale’s Bitcoin ETF (GBTC), its first since January. This is notable considering Grayscale’s previous $17.5 billion loss attributed to higher fees compared to competitors.


Other prominent Bitcoin ETFs, like Fidelity’s FBTC and Franklin Templeton’s EZBC, also reported significant inflows.

Grayscale’s Surprise Recovery: GBTC secures $63 million, reversing previous declines.
Market Recovery: Indicators suggest rising institutional confidence and potential positive impacts on Bitcoin’s price.

These inflows reflect a renewed confidence in the crypto market, potentially signalling a broader recovery and rising demand for Bitcoin.
Hong Kong Bitcoin ETFs Attract $258M, Fueling BTC Price Surge and Market Stability

Hong Kong’s Bitcoin ETFs have made a remarkable entrance, attracting $258 million in just three days of trading. This surge in capital inflows highlights a growing investor appetite for Bitcoin and underscores the strength of Hong Kong’s crypto market, especially compared to the global landscape.
While the US Spot Bitcoin ETF market experienced $860 million in outflows, Hong Kong’s market saw nearly $300 million in inflows, demonstrating its robustness during global market volatility.
This financial dynamism coincided with a 5.75% increase in Bitcoin’s price to $63,050.11, showcasing the market’s resilience.

Rapid Growth: Hong Kong ETFs quickly gathered $258 million, indicating strong investor confidence.
Market Contrast: Outshines US market dynamics with substantial weekly inflows.

The significant interest in Hong Kong’s Bitcoin ETFs likely played a pivotal role in the recent BTC price uptick, reinforcing positive market sentiment amid broader economic uncertainty.








The technical outlook suggests a bullish Bitcoin price prediction, as BTC is holding around a pivotal price point of $61,651. Ascending beyond this mark, Bitcoin faces immediate resistance at $64,565, with further resistance anticipated at $67,085 and $70,000.Conversely, if Bitcoin’s price falls, it encounters immediate support at $59,165, with subsequent levels at $56,675 and $54,335 poised to offer further stability.Recent trends on the 4-hour chart show Bitcoin surpassing the 50-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA) at $61,575, transitioning it from a resistance to a support level.As discussed in the morning story on Bitcoin price prediction, the ‘three white soldiers’ candlestick pattern suggests strong bullish momentum. Nonetheless, a resistance near $63,200 could temper the ascent, demanding a breakthrough for further gains.Bitcoin Price Prediction – Source: TradingviewShould Bitcoin overcome this barrier, it is likely to challenge the next resistance at $64,564 promptly.Overcoming this could thrust Bitcoin towards $67,084 and potentially reach as high as $70,000, especially if it surpasses a distinct double-top pattern near $67,000.Supporting this bullish scenario is the Relative Strength Index (RSI) at 63, signaling robust buying interest.Technical Indicators:
RSI: 63, reflects strong buying pressure.
50 EMA: $61,574, now provides support.
With these dynamics, Bitcoin’s prospects appear favourable above the $61,650 pivot. Remaining above this level could lead Bitcoin to test upper resistances. However, slipping below could trigger significant sell-offs, targeting lower support levels as the market reassesses its direction.Secure Early Advantages with the 99Bitcoins Presale

Kitty With Hat (KITHAT) to Surge 14,000% Ahead of MEXC Listing, as Shiba Inu, Bonk and Dogecoin Lag



                    

Early investors in memecoins like Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) made astronomical returns, and Kitty With Hat (KITHAT) presents a similar opportunity for a limited time.



Kitty With Hat (KITHAT), a newly launched Solana memecoin, is poised to explode over 14,000% in a matter of days, as former Shiba Inu (SHIB), Bonk (BONK) and Dogecoin (DOGE) investors pour funds into this new token.




KITHAT will be listed on MEXC, one of the largest centralized exchanges in the world, within a few days – and this is a massively bullish development for the token, as millions of new investors will easily be able to buy Kitty With Hat.



Currently, Kitty With Hat can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jupiter and Raydium, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days.



To buy KITHAT on these platforms, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Homo Pepe by entering its contract address – 3Wdkgv1iTBQQ9MnvA4TkAefe2SLdtSKfHwZbhKcEMZk8 – in the receiving field.




KITHAT currently has a market cap of just under $10,000, with over $4,000 in locked liquidity, meaning it has huge upside potential.



Early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and Bonk (BONK) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price.



If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner.

Venture Capitalists Funnel Nearly $2,500,000,000 Into Crypto in Q1 of 2024: Galaxy Research - The Daily Hodl


								New data from crypto insights firm Galaxy Research finds that during the first quarter of the year, venture capitalists poured in billions of dollars into the digital assets industry.
In a new article, Galaxy Research says that venture capitalists invested $2.49 billion into cryptocurrencies during Q1 of 2024, a 29% quarter-over-quarter (QoQ) rise.










The analytics platform says that heavy investments during Q1 of 2024 signal that Q4 of 2023 could have been the bottom of the market.
“In Q1 2024, venture capitalists invested $2.49 billion (+29% QoQ) into crypto and blockchain-focused companies across 603 deals (+68% QoQ). 
This was the first rise in both capital invested and deal count in three quarters, perhaps signaling that Q4 2023 was the ‘bottom,’ although a continuation of QoQ increases – and a more meaningful increase – would confirm that over the coming quarters.”
Source: Galaxy Research
Galaxy Research goes on to note that while venture capitalist investments into the crypto space have correlated with the price of Bitcoin (BTC) in the past, the crypto king’s massive rise in 2024 caused them to decouple.
 “While venture capital investment in the crypto sector has typically correlated to the Bitcoin price, that correlation has broken down over the past year, with bitcoin rising significantly since January 2023 but VC activity mostly languishing. 
Q1 2024 saw a significant rise in BTC, and while capital invested also rose, the investment activity is still nowhere near the levels when Bitcoin last traded over $60,000. 
The combination of crypto industry-native catalysts (Bitcoin exchange-traded funds, new areas like restaking, modularity, Bitcoin layer-2s, etc.) and macro headwinds (rates) contributed to the notable divergence.”

Bitcoin is trading for $62,754 at time of writing, a 5.2% increase during the last 24 hours.

Bitcoin's present price volatility points to the ETF mania

Bitcoin seems to be aligning with the viewpoints of traditional investors who have entered the digital asset space via the introduction of US exchange-traded funds. Furthermore, the price of BTC surged to $64,500 on May 4 due to fresh gains in out-of-hours trading.Bitcoin Wild West pricesThe largest crypto experienced a surge on Friday following a report that revealed a smaller-than-expected rise in US employment. This news has reignited expectations for interest rate cuts, which in turn has increased the attractiveness of speculative assets. The rally managed to recover a significant portion of the losses experienced earlier in the week due to increasing worries about the Federal Reserve officials adopting a more hawkish stance and a decrease in demand for the ETFs.Bitcoin experienced a significant 7% increase on Friday, reaching a price of $62,937. This upward movement also had a positive impact on other cryptocurrencies, including Ether, Solana, and even meme-based coins like Dogecoin. Bitcoin experienced a significant decline on May 1, reaching its lowest point in approximately two months at $56,527.On Wednesday, a significant amount of money, totaling $564 million, was withdrawn by investors from a group of nearly a dozen US ETFs. This marked the largest outflow of funds since these products were introduced in January. Higher-for-longer interest rates have also had a negative impact on other markets, such as equities.The drop in Bitcoin from the record of almost $74,000 reached in March has raised concerns among traders. According to some market analysts, some traders may perceive risks in the global macro environment that the Fed or general investors have not yet recognized.Bitcoin price movementCurrently, the value of Bitcoin (BTC) stands at $63,571.91. This represents a slight decrease of 0.2% compared to an hour ago, but a notable increase of 2.9% since yesterday. The current value of BTC is 1.0% higher than its value a week ago.The current global crypto market cap stands at $2.47 Trillion, with a 2.42% change in the last 24 hours and a significant 100.47% change compared to one year ago. Currently, BTC’s market capi stands at $1.25 Trillion, indicating a Bitcoin dominance of 50.63%. Meanwhile, the market cap of Stablecoins stands at $161 Billion, accounting for 6.51% of the total crypto market cap.The strength seen in the United States employment data gained momentum towards the end of the day, driven by positive signs of recovery in the crypto market, such as the recent inflows into the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) after a gap of almost three months.According to data from monitoring resource CoinGlass, BTC/USD has seen a 5% increase month-to-date at the time of writing, which is a significant improvement compared to the 15% losses in April.Despite the impressive weekend performance, there were concerns about the overall strength of the market without the participation of traditional financial institutions.One X user said, “Two main scenarios I am looking out for on $BTC at the moment. Green path is ideal. We hold the local highs we broke above and continue up to the major resistance. This will allow me to fill shorts on a number of alts across the board.”He ended by saying, “Red path is not ideal. We fail to hold this reclaim, see an “early” breakdown, and ideal short zones for most alts I’m eyeing up are not met.”

Vodafone looks to integrate crypto wallets with sim cards

Vodafone, a United Kingdom-based telecommunications provider, hopes to bring blockchain technology to smartphone users by integrating cryptocurrency wallets with subscriber identity module (SIM) cards. The ambitious move comes amid a company finance plan that reportedly involves Vodafone Idea Ltd., a separate entity operating in India that Vodafone Group carries a 45% stake in, taking on nearly $3 billion in debt including $1.8 billion in loans over the next two years. In a recent interview with Yahoo Finance Future Focus, Vodafone Blockchain Lead David Palmer discussed the company’s plans to integrate blockchain technology into smartphone sim cards:“By 2030 we’re expecting more than 20 billion mobile phones to be in operation, many of those being smartphones. … So we’ve focused on linking the sim card to digital identity, linking the sim card to blockchains, and using the cryptography we have in those sim cards for that integration.” Palmer elaborated on the figures he presented, stating that he expected there to be some eight billion smartphones in use by 2030 and predicting a surge in crypto wallets to 5.6 billion in the same time frame — enough to account for nearly 70 percent of all people on Earth.Despite the financial wrangling occurring with India-based Vodafone Idea Ltd, which recently sold off $2.2 billion worth of shares ahead of a debt raising plan worth a reported $3 billion, Vodafone Group has had a busy 2024. As Cointelegraph recently reported, the company entered into a 10-year strategic partnership with Microsoft to bring generative artificial intelligence (AI) services to Vodafone’s customers. Upon announcing the deal, Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella took the opportunity to hawk the disruptive nature of his company’s AI technologies declaring that the “new generation of AI will unlock massive new opportunities for every organization and every industry around the world.”This isn’t the first time a company’s worked to combine cell phone technology with blockchain hardware. Back in 2019, U.S. startup VaultTel announced its ambitions to create a physical wallet that could be slotted into a smartphone's SIM slot.Related: Vodafone auctions world’s first SMS 'Merry Christmas' as NFT for charity

Ethereum Bounces Back Strongly After $2,871 Support Rejection | Bitcoinist.com


								On Wednesday, ETH, the native coin of the Ethereum blockchain experienced a significant rejection at the resistance level of $2,871. Since this rejection, the price of Ethereum has gained a significant upward movement of over 9% and showing signs of even moving further.
At the time of writing, the price is still showing strong signs of moving upward toward the 100-day Simple Moving Average (SMA) and the trendline, both in the 4-hour and the 1-day timeframe. The price of ETH is currently trading around $3,116 and about 0.47% up in the last 24 hours.
A Further Look At The Ethereum Chart With The Following Technical Indicators
100-Day Moving Average and Trendline: As seen in the image below, although the price of ETH is currently moving toward the 100-day simple moving average and the trendline, it is still trading below these two indicators. This means at a certain point, the price of Ethereum could make a possible reversal and continue in its movement toward the downside.

The RSI Indicator: Also observing the chart with the help of the Relative Strength Index Indication (RSI), it shows that the RSI signal line is trending above the 50 line which strongly indicates that the price might still move upward, as seen in the chart.
The 4-Hour MACD Indicator: After a close look at the MACD indicator in the 4-hour timeframe, it can be seen that the MACD histogram has moved above the zero line. Also, the MACD line and the signal line have crossed and are heading toward the zero line. This suggests there may be sustained upward price movement until a potential reversal.
Final Thought On ETH Movement
Based on Ethereum’s previous movement, there are two resistance levels of $3,250 and $3,355, and a support level of $2,819. As the price of Ethereum is moving upward, if it manages to break above the resistance level of $3,250, it might continue to move even further toward the $3,355 resistance level. 
On the contrary, if Ethereum fails to break its previous resistance level, it might reserve and start a move downward toward its previous support level of  $2,819. Should ETH succeed in breaching this level of support, it may descend even further to establish a new low.

US Crackdown Prompts Acinq and zkSNACKs to Discontinue Services for American Crypto Users



                    

Amidst a recent crackdown on self-custodial cryptocurrency wallet providers by U.S. regulatory agencies targeting major players like Consensys and Samourai Wallet, Acinq’s Phoenix Wallet and zkSNACKs’ Wasabi Wallet have made the decision to discontinue services for customers based in the United States.



Expressing concerns over the legitimacy of self-custodial wallet providers as money service businesses in the wake of regulatory actions, both Acinq and zkSNACKs have taken steps to restrict access for U.S. users.




“In light of recent announcements by U.S. authorities, zkSNACKs is now strictly prohibiting U.S. users from using its services,” stated zkSNACKs in an April 27 release.



Similarly, Acinq highlighted uncertainties regarding the regulatory landscape in an April 26 post, explaining, “Recent announcements from US authorities cast a doubt on whether self-custodial wallet providers, Lightning service providers, or even Lightning nodes could be considered Money Services Businesses and be regulated as such.”



Acinq has set a deadline of May 2 for Phoenix Wallet users to adapt to the impending changes, while Wasabi Wallet’s new policy was immediately put into effect.

Advising Phoenix Wallet users to empty their wallets without force-closing them to avoid significant on-chain fees, Acinq provided guidance for the transition period.



Regulators worldwide have voiced concerns that self-custody crypto wallets might facilitate illicit activities like money laundering. 



This sentiment was underscored by recent actions taken against Consensys and Samourai Wallet.




Consensys received a Wells notice from the SEC, signaling potential enforcement actions related to its MetaMask products, while the co-founders of Samourai Wallet face charges of money laundering and operating an unlicensed money transmitting business brought by the U.S. Justice Department.



In contrast, European regulators have taken a more relaxed stance on potential regulations concerning self-custody wallets. 



Scrapping a proposed 1,000 euro limit on crypto payments from self-hosted wallets, European Parliament’s lead committees emphasized the importance of due diligence measures by crypto exchanges for transactions exceeding this threshold.

Crypto startups see rapid growth through 'fluid valuations' and decentralized cap tables â Bloomberg - Crypto Briefing




Cryptocurrency startups are increasingly adopting an aggressive form of fundraising known as open-ended or rolling funding rounds.This approach allows startups to continuously raise capital and rapidly boost their valuations, in contrast to the traditional venture capital model of discrete funding rounds spaced over several years.According to a report from Bloomberg, the rise of open-ended funding rounds in the crypto industry reflects both the sector’s recovery from the 2022 bear market and venture funds’ desire to deploy previously static cash.With this fundraising model, earlier investors benefit from the rapid increase in a startup’s valuation driven by commitments from later backers.While some investors and industry experts view these “fluid valuations” as perplexing and potentially lacking in fundamental drivers, the report claims that the traditional approach to venture capital formation may not be suited to digital-asset companies.“Capital formation in crypto is always evolving — governance, liquidity, and other important concepts that we’ve figured out in traditional startups are often a little different,” said Matt Luongo, chief executive at Thesis.Thesis is a venture studio, which helped develop and launch Mezo, a Bitcoin L2 protocol designed as an economic layer. Ed Roman, managing partner at Hack VC, noted that crypto startups generally prefer “decentralized cap tables” to help with governance, making the traditional priced rounds with a single, large, lead investor less suitable.Michael Heinrich, co-founder of 0G Labs, a blockchain startup focused on decentralized and modular artificial intelligence, noted that this type of structure is becoming more common when a deal is highly oversubscribed.“Investors are still willing to pay higher prices because it is seen as a signal of market success, even if in rapid succession,” Heinrich said.0G Labs itself raised $35 million in March through a rolling fundraise, with offers exceeding its planned raise by 20 times. The company’s valuation ranged from less than $40 million to hundreds of millions of dollars, depending on the investor.According to data from The Block Research as cited by Bloomberg, the average Series A round in crypto reached $26 million in the first quarter of 2024, the highest since early 2022. Overall venture investment in the sector increased to $2.5 billion during the same quarter.

Bitfinex users' personal information about to be leaked | Cryptopolitan

Recent unsettling news has erupted around Bitfinex, as the notorious ransomware group FSociety claims they have hijacked 2.5TB of data from the cryptocurrency exchange. They assert possession of not just trading data but also the personal details of 400,000 users.What’s more terrifying? They’re threatening to leak KYC (Know Your Customer) information of every user unless their demands are met. This alarming situation has sent waves of concern throughout the crypto community.Initial Leak DetailsFSociety has taken to the dark web, specifically their onion site, to broadcast their claim. They’ve even posted links to text files that supposedly contain a chunk of usernames alongside plaintext passwords. Interestingly, after scouring the list, some Bitfinex account holders, including individuals associated with major trading firms like Alameda Research, have reported that their details do not appear in the leaked data.The hackers have thrown down the gauntlet, stating that if their undisclosed requirements aren’t fulfilled, they will dump the KYC documentation for all users. The sheer volume of data they claim to possess suggests that they could potentially have every KYC record since Bitfinex’s inception.A deep dive into the leaked data reveals numerous email domains, predominantly public ones such as Gmail, Yahoo, and Outlook, among a long list of others. A peculiar standout in the list is coinfarm.co.za, which could hint at targeted trimming of more sensitive or valuable accounts from the bulk data.Community Reactions and Official ResponseThe leak’s authenticity was inadvertently tested when an individual tried one of the passwords from the file, only to be met with a prompt for two-factor authentication—suggesting the data might be genuine. Adding to the chaos, Bitfinex’s CTO, Paolo Ardoino, has been tagged in ongoing discussions to address these claims.In response, Ardoino expressed skepticism regarding the breach’s origin, suggesting that the data might have been gathered from other sources rather than from Bitfinex itself. He mentioned that out of the 22.5k email-password pairs posted, only about 5k match Bitfinex accounts, which would be unlikely if the data were directly from their databases. Ardoino also pointed out that Bitfinex was never contacted by the hackers, which contradicts typical ransomware protocol where hackers would reach out to negotiate.Despite the lack of direct extortion attempts towards Bitfinex, the hackers have made the compromised data freely downloadable. This unorthodox approach has led to speculation that the true motive might be less about a direct ransom and more about promoting some dubious investment linked to the data breach publicity.Implications and Ongoing InvestigationsThe unfolding situation raises numerous red flags concerning digital security in the cryptocurrency landscape. Notably, Ardoino has reassured the community that an extensive analysis is underway to ascertain the integrity of Bitfinex’s systems. Furthermore, the platform’s KYC system, designed with stringent rate limits, theoretically prevents mass data exfiltration, suggesting that any large-scale data leak might be implausible.The incident has drawn the attention of various security experts and researchers, accelerating the spread of fear, uncertainty, and doubt (FUD) across the sector. It’s worth noting that many of the leaked account details correlate with data from previous breaches, like the one at Coinmarketcap, highlighting a common issue where users recycle credentials across multiple platforms.As investigations continue and the crypto community remains on high alert, the real challenge lies in discerning the true scale and impact of the breach. With funds reportedly secure, the primary concern now shifts to the potential misuse of personal data and the overarching vulnerabilities exposed by such incidents in the cryptocurrency exchanges.

MATIC Bullish Signals Abound: Technical Indicators Hint At Sustained Uptrend


                            MATIC is the native utility token of the Polygon blockchain and it is currently ranked 18th by market cap, with a total supply of 10 billion MATIC and a total trading volume of over $204 million in the last 24 hours. It has been moving upward since its last rejection at a $0.6342 support level.  
Following the recent bullish trend of the crypto market, MATIC has not been left behind as the price has been on an uptrend with very strong momentum for a while now. Since its last rejection point, MATIC has seen a price reversal of over 10%.
Technical Indicators Point Toward Sustained Uptrend For MATIC
To figure out where MATIC’s price might be headed next, several indicators can be used to examine the chart;
1-Day MACD: A technical look at the MACD indicator from the 4-hour timeframe, the MACD histograms are trending above the zero line, and both the MACD line and the Signal line have crossed and are heading towards the MACD zero line, indicating a bullish trend.

1-Day RSI: the formation of the Relative Strength Index (RSI) in the above image also suggests an upward movement as the RSI signal line is seen moving toward the 50% level. This indicates that buyers are gradually becoming active in the market therefore overpowering the strength of sellers.
4-hour Alligator: A look at the alligator indicator from the 4-hour time frame shows that the crypto asset is trading above the alligator lines as the alligator lip and teeth have both successfully crossed above the alligator jaw, suggesting that the price might continue to move in an upward direction.

Potential Price Movement
From the previous downward movement, the price of MATIC has managed to create one major resistance level of $0.7365 and one major support level of $0.6324. Currently, MATIC is moving toward this resistance level and if it breaks above this level, it might go even further to test the next resistance level of $0.7680. 
However, if it fails to break above this major resistance, it will reverse and start a downward movement toward its previous support. Also, if it manages to break below this support level, the price might move further downward thereby continuing on its downtrend. As of the time of writing the price of MATIC was trading around $0.7253 and about -0.94% down in the last 24 hour

Bitfinex CTO denies new allegations of user data hack, assures funds are secure - Crypto Briefing




Bitfinex has been thrust into the spotlight recently after a ransomware group, named “FSOCIETY,” claimed to have gained access to 2.5TB of the exchange’s data and the personal details of 400,000 users. In response to the allegations, Bitfinex CTO Paolo Ardoino clarified that the claims of a database hack appear to be “fake” and assured user funds remain secure.Ardoino found out there were data discrepancies and user data mismatches in the hacker’s posts.The hackers posted sample data containing 22,500 records of emails and passwords. However, according to Paolo, Bitfinex does not store plain-text passwords or two-factor authentication (2FA) secrets in clear text. Additionally, of the 22,500 emails in the leaked data, only 5,000 match Bitfinex users.According to him, it could be a common issue in data security: users often reuse the same email and password across multiple sites, which might explain the presence of some Bitfinex-related emails in the dataset.Another highlight is the lack of communication from the hackers. They did not contact Bitfinex directly to report this data breach or to negotiate, which is atypical behavior for ransomware attacks that typically involve some form of ransom demand or contact.Moreover, information about the alleged hack was posted on April 25, but Bitfinex only became aware of the claim recently. Paolo said if there had been any genuine threat or demand, the hackers would have likely used Bitfinex’s bug bounty program or customer support channels to make contact, none of which occurred.
“The alleged hackers didn’t contact us. If they had any real information they would have asked a ramson through our bug bounty, customer support ticket etc. We couldn’t find any request,” wrote Ardoino.
Bitfinex has conducted a thorough analysis of its systems and, so far, has not found any evidence of a breach. Paolo said the team would continue to review and analyze all available data to ensure that nothing is overlooked in their security assessments.After news of a potential breach surfaced, Shinoji Research, an X user, confirmed the authenticity of the leak. The user said he tried one of the passwords in the leaked information and received a 2FA.However, at press time, he removed his post and corrected the previous information.In a separate post on X, Ardoino suggested that the real motive behind the exaggerated breach claims is to sell the hacking tool to other potential scammers.The idea is to generate buzz around these high-profile (Bitfinex, SBC Global, Rutgers, Coinmoma) hacks to promote their tool, which they allege can enable others to carry out similar attacks and potentially make large sums of money.Additionally, he questioned why the hackers would need to sell a hacking tool for $299 if they had really accessed Bitfinex and obtained valuable data.

How stablecoins are shaking up parallel financial networks | Cryptopolitan

Imagine a world where monetary authorities might need to rescue cryptocurrency markets. We almost saw this scenario unfold with the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank (SVB) last year. SVB’s downfall shook the stablecoin operator Circle, which had a whopping $3.3 billion uninsured at SVB. This crisis saw Circle’s USDC—a token touted for its stability—lose its peg to the dollar until the Federal Reserve stepped in to secure the bank’s deposits, averting a larger crisis. As the crypto market rebounds from its low in 2022, stablecoins are capturing widespread attention. These tokens, created by private firms, mimic digital cash, typically matching the U.S. dollar one-for-one. Their reserves are expected to hold equivalent U.S. dollar amounts. The push for stablecoins is gaining momentum with new entries from corporations like PayPal and Ripple. Legislative support is also on the rise, with Senators Cynthia Lummis and Kirsten Gillibrand proposing laws to provide a solid framework for these tokens.The reemergence of Stripe marked another turn. After a six-year hiatus from crypto payments, Stripe’s return underscores a renewed interest in integrating cryptocurrency into mainstream finance. Jonathan Bixby, a notable figure in the crypto world, remarked that Stripe’s strategy mirrors the earlier U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs, which aimed to integrate traditional capital into crypto. He suggested that Stripe’s initiative might be a reversal, bringing crypto into everyday financial transactions.The use of stablecoins goes beyond just technological innovation; they are beginning to answer the critical question of crypto’s practical applications. These tokens are not just theoretical but are actively used in real-world transactions. Visa’s analysis revealed over $2.5 trillion in stablecoin transactions within just 30 days, with USDC outpacing its rival Tether. However, removing automated trading transactions drops the volume dramatically, suggesting a heavy reliance on programmed trading in decentralized finance platforms.This growing use of stablecoins positions them as potential major players in the shadow banking system, which includes various non-bank financial institutions like asset managers and insurance companies. If stablecoins can command large-scale transactions, they could become custodians of vast sums of money.Currently, most stablecoin holders invest in short-term U.S. Treasuries or keep funds in bank deposits, benefiting from returns or safekeeping. Some engage in reverse repo markets, lending out cash for short periods against secure collateral like Treasuries. This strategy safeguards against counterparty risks, essential in maintaining financial stability.However, Frances Coppola, a financial commentator, points out the drawbacks of these strategies. If stablecoin operators focus solely on short-term asset holding, they might struggle to generate significant profits. Moreover, the mismatch between the durations of their assets and liabilities could pose additional financial risks.There’s a broader fear among federal regulators that stablecoins might accumulate too many Treasuries, prompting discussions about potentially limiting their growth. Although concerns about their size and impact may seem distant, underestimating these factors could lead to significant issues as the market scale increases.The reintroduction of crypto payments, coupled with Stripe’s expanded service offerings allowing integration with competing payment solutions, shows a strategic pivot towards more open and versatile financial operations.John Collison, co-founder of Stripe, humorously noted that transaction settlements and costs with stablecoins are now far more manageable, unlike the epic scale of Christopher Nolan’s films. This comparison not only lightens the mood but also emphasizes the efficiency and user-friendliness of using stablecoins over traditional cryptocurrencies.

Cryptocurrency investor loses $70 million in six hours: Address poisoning attack


A cryptocurrency investor has fallen victim to an address poisoning attack, resulting in a staggering loss of $70 million worth of Wrapped Bitcoin (WBTC). The incident, which unfolded over the course of around six hours, has sent shockwaves through the cryptocurrency community.
According to a post by Lookonchain on the X, the unfortunate investor created a new address, “0xd9A1b0B1e1aE382DbDc898Ea68012FfcB2853a91,” and transferred a small amount of Ethereum (ETH), approximately 0.05 ETH, to this newly generated destination.

This observed behavior is common in the decentralized finance (DeFi) space, mainly due to the need for gas fees. Essentially, when cryptocurrency investors create new crypto wallet addresses, they need to fund them with the native token first to pay for future gas fees, in this case, Ether or ETH.


However, a scammer had been waiting unbeknownst to the investor, ready to strike at the opportune moment.
Address poisoning attack
The scammer, employing a technique known as address poisoning, generated an address that shared the same starting and ending letters as the investor’s new address. In a calculated move, the scammer transferred zero ETH to the investor, causing it to appear in the investor’s transaction history.
Many cryptocurrency wallets hide the middle portion of addresses with ellipses (“…”) to enhance user interface aesthetics. Therefore, when the investor attempted to transfer their 1,155 WBTC, valued at approximately $71 million, they inadvertently copied the scammer’s cleverly crafted address, believing it to be their own.
Notably, crypto users often only check the destination address by quickly glancing at the first and last four characters.
The devastating consequence of this mistake was the irreversible transfer of the investor’s WBTC holdings to the scammer’s address. The crypto community has expressed shock and disbelief at the magnitude of the loss, with many calling for increased awareness and education surrounding the risks associated with cryptocurrency transactions.

This incident underscores the critical importance of thoroughly verifying addresses before initiating any transfers, particularly when dealing with substantial sums of digital assets. As the cryptocurrency landscape continues to evolve, it is imperative that investors remain vigilant and stay abreast of the latest security measures and best practices to safeguard their investments.

Weekend Market Watch - Altcoins soar as Bitcoin recovers above $64K

Following a week of declining trends, Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Dogecoin experienced a surge in trading on Saturday afternoon. Following the April 2024 jobs data release by the U.S. Labor Department, there was a significant surge in crypto values. Last month, the U.S. saw an increase of 175,000 jobs, resulting in a slight rise in the unemployment rate to 3.9%. Experts had predicted the addition of 235,000 new jobs and a 3.8% unemployment rate.Altcoins season dominates yet againBitcoin experienced a tumultuous trading week with significant price drops on multiple occasions. The week began with a promising surge as BTC reached nearly $65,000, but unfortunately, the market quickly fell under the control of the bears, causing it to drop to $62,000.The downward trend continued as the asset plummeted to and below $60,000. The correction reached a two-month low of $56,500 on Wednesday, just before the latest US FOMC meeting.After the necessary steps were taken and the Federal Reserve announced its decision to hold off on raising interest rates in the near future, BTC experienced a sudden surge of $2,000 followed by a rapid decline, ultimately returning to its initial position. It made significant progress in the subsequent hours and came close to reaching $60,000 yesterday, as reported.Initially halted, it eventually managed to overcome that mental barrier later in the day. The market bulls maintained their momentum and drove BTC to reach a multi-day high of $63,500. Despite experiencing a slight decline, the current value of Bitcoin is approximately $63,000.With a daily increase of 6%, the market cap of this asset has now reached $1.240 trillion, solidifying its dominance over altcoins at 50.5%.The top performers among the largest altcoins are found in the unpredictable meme coin sector. Dogecoin, the first and largest of the cohort, has experienced a significant increase of over 20%. Following the recent announcement, Tesla has decided to accept DOGE as a form of payment.PEPE has experienced a significant increase of 11.7%, while SHIB has also seen a gain of 8% and is now valued above $0.000025. Ethereum and Binance Coin have both experienced a notable increase of approximately 3.5%. As a result, the price of ETH has surged to over $3,127, while BNB is currently trading at $590.The remaining larger-cap altcoins are also showing gains, such as TON, BC, AVAX, NEAR, and HBAR. The crypto market cap has seen a remarkable recovery, surging by over $200 billion since Wednesday’s low. Currently, it stands at an impressive $2.4 trillion, according to CoinGecko.Bitcoin market performanceBitcoin’s price has experienced significant fluctuations over the past few weeks. The bulls are making a strong comeback, successfully reclaiming their dominance by surpassing the $60K mark. But can it be sustained in the long run? The price of BTC has experienced a significant rebound of over 12.50% within a span of three days, following a recent dip to a two-month low of around $56,550. It has now surged past $64,000 as of May 4.The recent upturn has been primarily driven by the U.S. Federal Reserve’s pledge to keep interest rates steady until 2024. In addition, the latest U.S. employment data shows a decrease in jobless claims to their lowest point since mid-February, which has contributed to the continued upward trend in Bitcoin’s price.Some members of the Bitcoin market are hopeful for a sustained BTC bull run in the upcoming months. One independent market analyst predicts that the price of BTC could potentially reach $85,000. The crypto market has experienced significant growth in 2024, despite the presence of higher interest rates and indications of a weakening economy. In addition, the approval of Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) in the U.S. provided a significant boost.However, it is important to note that certain factors that have been driving the market may be losing momentum, which could have a negative impact on valuations in the future. Unless there is a substantial improvement in the practicality of cryptocurrencies, this could pose a long-term challenge.Currently, the value of Bitcoin (BTC) stands at $63,636.10, reflecting a slight 0.1% increase within the past hour and a notable 3.3% increase since yesterday. The current value of BTC is 1.4% higher than it was 7 days ago.

Ethereum and XRP Statements from Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse - Bitcoin Sistemi


Fox Business' cryptocurrency journalist Eleanor Terrett explained in her statement the details of the speech given by Brad Garlinghouse, CEO of Ripple, the company behind XRP, at the conference called “the future of digital assets”.
According to Terrett, Ripple CEO said in his statement that Ethereum is not a security, and in addition, XRP is not a security either. Garlinghouse stated that the SEC was “very wrong” and called SEC chairman Gary Gensler “an unethical person.”


The SEC maintains that all cryptocurrencies other than Bitcoin are securities and must be registered with the SEC. However, the institution, which previously had a more moderate attitude towards Ethereum, has recently been working on the fact that ETH is also a security.

However, in his tweet, Garlinghouse expressed his excitement at the increase in the amount of events held by the XRP community this year, including XRP Las Vegas and XRPL apex, as well as the XRP Gold Coast event in March.





Garlinghouse also expressed his welcome for new native capabilities for projects built on the XRP Ledger.

EXCLUSIVE: Trump-Themed MAGA Memecoin Plans To Rival Dogecoin And Shiba Inu With 'Four More Years Of Catalysts' - Benzinga

“I can't think of anyone else who is a greater source of meta than Donald Trump.”Steven Steele, chief marketing officer of MAGA Memecoin TRUMP/USD, the Trump-themed cryptocurrency that has been making waves for being the former president’s biggest portfolio holding, thinks it is “increasingly likely” the 45th president becomes the 47th president of the United States.In that case, we could be provided with “four more years of hilarity and catalysts,” Steele told Benzinga in an interview. Polls have the former and the current presidents neck-and-neck, as have prediction markets, which gave Trump a two-point edge over Joe Biden, as of May 4. Whether he secures a successful re-election bid or not, interest in Donald Trump will likely intensify between now and Nov. 5.And with it, the appeal of investing in TRUMP, Steele said. He told Benzinga he cannot think of any person that will be covered more than Trump going into the election season “and probably beyond.”How MAGA Memecoin Turned ‘The Most Covered Person’ Into A CryptocurrencyAndrew Kang, a crypto venture capitalist, sees Trump as “one of the best attention monopolizers in the world.”His fund Mechanism Capital announced on Feb. 6 that it had accumulated TRUMP — the first meme coin than can “rival Dogecoin DOGE/USD and Shiba Inu SHIB/USD.”Indeed, among meme coins, MAGA Memecoin is somewhat of a pioneer. It was the first to successfully introduce a meme coin based on a real-world person or cultural phenomenon. Speculating on the attention created by certain events, such as the death of former Secretary of State Henry Kissinger, has since become a staple of the meme coin circus.Steele, who initially was just an investor in TRUMP, said the “enormous potential” made him join as chief marketing officer. Following its inception in August 2023, TRUMP grew to a preliminary peak of $448 million in market capitalization on March 5 and is currently trading around a valuation of $220 million.Steele attributes this rise in value to several key points:Consistent marketing: MAGA Memecoin holds weekly spaces for its community and publishes Trump-themed memes on its X account.Philanthropic action: The project has donated over $1 million in Ethereum ETH/USD for 37 straight weeks to support for homeless veterans and the prevention of child trafficking. Steele pointed out this was one of key points that drew him in, with the National Veterans Homeless Support being able to scale its operation thanks to the donations.Partnerships: MAGA Memecoin recently announced it had onboarded controversial political figure and self-proclaimed “agent provocateur” Roger Stone as a partner. But the inevitable consequence of success is competition, a rule that applies even — or particularly — to meme coins.Read Also: Bitcoin, Ethereum, Dogecoin Rally, As Market Sentiment Soars On Macro Data: ‘Above $67,000 We Fly Like A Bird,’ Claims Trader‘To Get Unprecedented Results, You Have To Do Unprecedented Things’In a March interview with Coindesk, Steele said he wants TRUMP “up there with a DOGE or SHIB, that kind of scale and market cap and popularity.” Asked how to make that a reality, Steele told Benzinga, “To get unprecedented results, you have to do unprecedented things.” Signing Stone is one example of that, Steele pointed out, as it brought MAGA Memecoin a lot of “normie” investors that bought TRUMP as their first cryptocurrency. But since Steele’s March interview, the political meme coin landscape has changed. TRUMP isn’t the only politicial meme coin anymore. In fact, it currently isn’t even the biggest one. BODEN BODEN/USD a meme coin parodying Biden with intentionally poor spelling and cartoons, has recorded an astronomic surge to over $700 million in market capitalization and is currently trading at a valuation of around $290 million. The emergence of a quasi-rival has even sparked a prediction market about which meme coin would get to $1 billion first (BODEN is leading TRUMP 54% to 46%).Steele told Benzinga he is aware of the coin — and others that have boarded the “PoliFi” meta — but isn’t worried by or interested in them.Indeed, a de facto rivalry between the two meme coins, similar to that between Dogecoin and Shiba Inu, could be positive and create more interest and loyalty among holders.But what does the man whose face is on the memes powering MAGA Memecoin think of all of this?Read Also: Dogecoin Is ‘Primed For Higher’ But Pepe Is ‘On A Moon Mission,’ Exclaims Trader‘More Than Enough Reasons To Believe’ Trump Knows Of TRUMPDonald Trump’s stance on Bitcoin BTC/USD and crypto has shifted from considering them a “disaster waiting to happen” and being “not a big fan” in 2021 to now expressing enjoyment with crypto and the “crazy new currencies” apart from Bitcoin.Steele thinks there are “more than enough reasons to believe” the former president is aware of the meme coin his personality started, especially considering Stone was a consultant for Trump’s 2016 campaign. He suggested that Trump may have been referring to MAGA Memecoin in his mention of “crazy new currencies.”Steele also shared that Trump is aware and a fan of Shawn Farash, the host of the project’s weekly spaces and a proficient Trump impersonator.Trump’s allocation of TRUMP was an intentional “strategically savvy and hilarious” move by the project to promote the coin. And, just as planned, it has since become Trump’s biggest holding.But what if Trump sells “his bag” of MAGA Memecoin? If the meme coin were to appreciate going into the election season, Trump’s current holdings of $2.73 million may prompt him to think about cashing out.Steele acknowledged the possibility but does not see it as a problem. Similar to the 2021 incident when Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin sold and donated his allocation of SHIB, Steele thinks it may even have a positive impact on MAGA Memecoin.Whether TRUMP can really become, as Andrew Kang said, the first meme coin to break the reign of dog-themed incumbents remains to be seen. Meme coins like Pepe PEPE/USD and dogwifhat WIF/USD — yet another dog coin — hold a substantial lead over political meme coins. But when considering the combination of the “memecoin supercycle” with the “weirdest campaign” the incumbent president has ever been in, who knows what may happen between now and November?Read Next: Trump Says London, Paris No Longer Recognizable: ‘We Can’t Let That Happen Here’Image created using artificial intelligence with Midjourney

Paolo Ardoino Says There Is No Evidence of Bitfinex Hack


Bitfinex CTO Paolo Ardoino has confidently dismissed claims of a security breach at the cryptocurrency exchange. 
Ardoino’s clarification comes after rumors circulated about a potential database leak involving 22,500 records of emails and passwords purportedly from Bitfinex users.
Bitfinex CTO Paolo Ardoino Denies Hack Rumors
According to Ardoino, the evidence presented by the alleged hackers does not align with Bitfinex’s data handling practices. He highlighted a significant discrepancy in the data. Consequently, noting that only about 5,000 of the 22,500 emails matched Bitfinex user accounts. 
This is a clear indicator, he suggests, that if these records were from Bitfinex, there would be a complete match.

“We don’t store plaintext passwords, nor 2FA secrets in clear text. [And] only 5,000 of 22,500 emails are matching with Bitfinex users. If that was part of our database, we would expect 100% matching,” Ardoino said. 

The timing and method of the hackers’ claim also raise questions about its legitimacy. Ardoino pointed out that the hackers did not contact Bitfinex directly. Their claim was made public on April 25, with a seven-day response window, which Bitfinex only discovered a day before the deadline. 


“If they had any real information, they would have asked for a ransom through our bug bounty program, customer support ticket, emails, or Twitter,” Ardoino explained.

Security experts quickly jumped on the bandwagon, hyping the breach without substantial evidence. For instance, Shinoji Research claimed that 2.5 terabytes of customer data was leaked. However, Bitfinex’s preliminary investigations suggest that the database is likely a compilation of information from various cryptocurrency breaches.
Ardoino noted that it is common for users to reuse email and password combinations across multiple sites, which might explain the overlap.

As Bitfinex continues its thorough review and system analysis, Ardoino reassured users and stakeholders, stating, “While we believe this is pure FUD, we’ll keep reviewing information to ensure no stone remains unturned.”

Fed's Williams insists that 2% inflation target 'critical'

According to New York Federal Reserve Bank President John Williams, maintaining price stability and achieving economic prosperity heavily relies on the U.S. central bank’s 2% inflation target.In the coming months, policymakers at the Fed are set to conduct a comprehensive evaluation of the central bank’s policy framework, with several critics advocating for significant modifications.Fed set to go hard on rate cutsIn the face of ongoing demands for the Reserve to revamp its approach to guiding, setting, and communicating policy, he staunchly defends the importance of the inflation target.Theory and experience have also shown the importance of transparency and clear communication, including setting an explicit, numerical longer-run inflation target, and of taking appropriate actions to support the achievement of that goal […] These are critical in anchoring inflation expectations, which, in turn, help keep inflation at the target.
New York’s reserve President John WilliamsFor over two years, the Fed has been actively addressing the issue of high inflation. In March 2022, they made the decision to raise interest rates by over 5%  points, which is a remarkably bold move not witnessed in four decades.Although price pressures have eased since their peak in mid-2022, inflation continues to exceed the Fed’s 2% goal, which has been a key focus of the Fed’s policy since 2012. In fact, Lawrence Summers, the former U.S. Treasury Secretary, suggested at the same conference that the Fed should reconsider its 2% inflation goal.According to his prediction, retaining it would lead to a significant economic downturn in the United States in the near future. Summers also criticized other aspects of the Commission’s communication, particularly the variety of policy views expressed by central bankers in speeches and public events.Rate cuts effects on the crypto marketSpeaking on the same panel as Williams, Chicago Fed President Austan Goolsbee emphasized the importance of diverse perspectives and highlighted the significance of effective communication.It would be beneficial for the Fed to enhance its quarterly “dot plot” of policymakers’ interest-rate-path views by incorporating the individual economic expectations that shape each projection.In a recent decision, the entityls policymakers opted to maintain short-term borrowing costs within the 5.25%-5.5% range, which has remained unchanged since July 2023. Goolsbee and Williams did not provide any recent insights into the direction of inflation this year or the timing of potential rate cuts by the Fed.Traders have been shaken by the recent decline in digital asset prices, which has been further intensified by ongoing macroeconomic challenges. How negative are the sentiments in the crypto market today?Fed and the crypto weekendIndicators of optimism, or the lack thereof, can be observed in betting markets such as Polymarket and Fed fund futures, which are actively traded on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange. These vague yet combined predictions regarding the timing of potential interest rate cuts by the Fed Reserve highlight a noticeable difference.Traders on Polymarket, a decentralized prediction market platform, observed a 7% probability in March that the Commission would maintain interest rates unchanged until 2024. Currently, traders are estimating a 38% probability that the entity will not implement any rate cuts throughout the year.That’s significantly more negative than the 23% probability of no rate cuts calculated on Tuesday by investment analysis firm Bianco Research. The organization utilized data from the CME’s FedWatch Tool, which indicates that CME traders are predicting a 45% probability of a rate cut by the Fed in September.When interest rates rise, the appeal of riskier assets such as stocks and crypto tends to diminish. Investors find the returns on these assets less enticing compared to more stable options like cash and U.S. Treasury bills.Following its policy meeting in March, the Fed Reserve projected three rate cuts of a quarter-percentage point each for the remainder of the year. In light of recent indications of persistent inflation in the United States and unexpectedly robust wage growth, Fed Reserve policymakers and participants in the financial markets have become less confident.

Another Cryptocurrency Platform Developer Disappears with Investors' Money - Bitcoin Sistemi


LENX Finance, which had raised $10.22 million through LBP financing on January 7 this year, is now under suspicion of a rug pull scam. Many users reported that all treasury funds were transferred on March 27, and the official Twitter account also stopped updating since then.
Originally known as RenaissanceDAO, a fragmented NFT marketplace inspired by OlympusDAO, the LENX team closed a $250,000 seed round investment in Frax Finance on February 28, 2022.



In another development, the cryptocurrency space faced another rug pull claim about two weeks ago. This time, blockchain platform ZKasino was at the center of the accusations, with many investors claiming their money was stolen. Despite the allegations, ZKasino continued to post updates before disappearing from the public eye along with investors' money.
The latest development shows that a suspect was arrested by authorities in the Netherlands and over $12 million was seized in the process. A 26-year-old man was arrested earlier this week over a ZKasino rug pull, the Dutch Financial Information and Investigation Service (FIOD) announced on Wednesday.





According to the press release, Dutch authorities began investigating the $33 million crypto platform scam on April 25. The criminal investigation began with online reports from the crypto community and information from FIOD's intelligence departments.

Crazy Wolf (CRAWOLF) Coin Will Surge 7,000% Within 48 Hours, as it Looks to Challenge Shiba Inu and Dogecoin



                    

Crazy Wolf (CRAWOLF) could become a viral memecoin, like Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE).



Crazy Wolf (CRAWOLF), a Solana memecoin that was launched today, is aiming to challenge other memecoin giants, such as Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE).




Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Crazy Wolf presents a similar opportunity.



The exciting memecoin is poised to rally 7,300% in the coming two days, and Crazy Wolf could potentially reach a multi-million dollar market cap within a few weeks.



Currently, Crazy Wolf can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jupiter and Raydium, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days.




To buy Crazy Wolf on these platforms, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Crazy Wolf by entering its contract address – 4cra6VGCDowfFz3HDz5ctXtCSAhQQ5FEscKMLGzB56ML – in the receiving field.



In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price.



If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner.



The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum.




This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like CRAWOLF.

Wrapped Bitcoin (WBTC) Wallet Loses $69,300,000 Worth of Crypto in Apparent Address Poisoning Scam - The Daily Hodl


								A crypto wallet lost $69.3 million worth of Wrapped Bitcoin (WBTC) in an apparent address-poisoning attack, according to the blockchain security firm CertiK.
Address poisoning usually involves a scammer sending a wallet a tiny amount of crypto via an address that’s designed to look similar to the wallet’s, according to an explanation provided by Ledger, a digital asset wallet provider.










The ploy is designed to trick wallet holders into mistakenly copying the scammer’s address from their transaction history and having funds sent to that wallet instead.
In this instance, CertiK notes that a scammer mimicked a transfer of 0.05 Ethereum (ETH), which tricked the victim into sending 1,155 WBTC worth $69.3 million to the wrong address.
WBTC is an ERC-20 token pegged to the price of BTC, allowing traders to speculate on Bitcoin while staying within the Ethereum ecosystem. The 16th-ranked crypto asset by market cap is trading at $62,953 at time of writing and is up nearly 7% in the past 24 hours.
The blockchain security firm Peckshield notes that the scammer swapped out the stolen WBTC for 23,000 ETH and then transferred them out.
Ethereum is trading at $3,116 at time of writing. The second-ranked crypto asset by market cap is up more than 4% in the past 24 hours.

Dogecoin Price Slides Amidst Crypto Market Correction: Down 4.82% to $0.15



                    

Dogecoin‘s value has taken a hit amidst a broader decline in the cryptocurrency market. On April 27, DOGE saw a decrease of 4.82%, settling at approximately $0.15.



This decline was more pronounced compared to the overall crypto market, which experienced a 2.25% drop on the same day. 




Over the past month, Dogecoin has plummeted by 38% from its recent peak of $0.229.



The recent downturn in Dogecoin’s price can be attributed to several factors, with one significant influence being the release of the U.S. gross domestic product (GDP) report on April 25. 



The U.S. economy’s growth in the first quarter of 2024 fell short of expectations, recording a 1.6% increase instead of the anticipated 2.5%. 




Additionally, there was only a 0.3% rise in personal consumption expenditures for March.



Consequently, expectations for Federal Reserve interest rate cuts in 2024 have been revised down to just 33 basis points, a considerable reduction from earlier projections.



The anticipation of sustained high interest rates has led to a rise in the yield on the benchmark U.S. 10-year Treasury note, reaching 4.739% on April 24, its highest level in five months. 



This increase has made riskier crypto assets less appealing to investors. For instance, on the day when the yield peaked, five spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) experienced outflows totaling $217 million.

Furthermore, Dogecoin’s open interest (OI) has declined to $865.63 million on April 27 from its peak of $2.21 billion nearly a month ago. 



Additionally, the funding rate has dropped to 0.0063% per eight hours. 



These developments indicate a prevailing bearish sentiment in the market, with traders adopting a cautious stance due to uncertainty surrounding Dogecoin’s future price movements or reduced interest in high leverage trading.



Today’s decrease in Dogecoin’s price appears to be a continuation of a selling trend that started when the price encountered resistance marked by a descending trendline and the 50-day exponential moving average (50-day EMA). 



The descending trendline resistance has consistently hindered DOGE’s upward movements over the past 30 days. 



Currently, the cryptocurrency is testing its multi-week ascending trendline support, suggesting a potential rebound that could propel the price towards the descending trendline resistance at around $0.159 by the end of April.

Ukraine Unveils a 'Technological Leap That No Diplomatic Service in the World Has Yet Made'" | Cryptoglobe


                                
According to a report by The Guardian, Ukraine’s Foreign Ministry recently a groundbreaking announcement on Wednesday, introducing an AI-generated spokesperson named Victoria Shi, a pioneering move in the world of international diplomacy. Dressed in a dark suit and presented in a video on social media, Victoria is designed to deliver official statements that are written and verified by human staff but presented through her digital persona.



The Foreign Ministry highlighted that this innovative approach is intended to optimize resource utilization and save time for its diplomats. Victoria’s introduction represents a significant shift towards integrating advanced technology in government operations, underscoring a commitment to modernization and efficiency.



According to the report, Victoria Shi, termed a “digital person” by the ministry, embodies a blend of technology and human effort. She gesticulates and moves naturally, adding a layer of human-like interaction that is often missing in digital communications. The statements she delivers are crafted by human experts, ensuring that the content remains accurate and trustworthy while the AI handles the visual representation.



Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba described the initiative as a “technological leap that no diplomatic service in the world has yet made,” pointing to the innovative use of AI in public administration. 







            
            

            
            

            
            

        

The name “Victoria Shi” draws from the word “victory” and the Ukrainian phrase for artificial intelligence, “shtuchniy intelekt.” Her creators, a team known as the Game Changers who are also involved in virtual-reality content related to the war in Ukraine, designed her to embody a forward-looking, victorious image that resonates with the Ukrainian spirit.



Interestingly, the report went on to say that Victoria’s appearance and voice are modeled after Rosalie Nombre, a well-known Ukrainian singer and a former contestant on Ukraine’s version of “The Bachelor.” Nombre, born in the now Russian-controlled city of Donetsk, lent her likeness to the project without charge, contributing to a cause that blends national pride with technological innovation.



To maintain authenticity and prevent misinformation, all statements made by Victoria will be accompanied by a QR code linking back to the text versions on the ministry’s official website.

Economist Nouriel Roubini blasts Bitcoin’s decentralization as ‘nonsense'


Renowned economist Nouriel Roubini has once again delivered a scathing critique of Bitcoin (BTC), questioning its decentralization and doubts about security and scalability. 
Notably, Roubini has maintained a dismissive stance towards Bitcoin and the broader cryptocurrency space, often branding them as scams.
In a May 3 debate organized by financial news aggregator Zerohedge, where Bitcoin was pitted against gold, Roubini dismantled the foundational principles of the leading cryptocurrency. 


Drawing on his reputation for accurately predicting the 2008 financial crisis, he argued that Bitcoin’s security and scalability promises are less fulfilled than those of traditional monetary systems.
Roubini underscored the vulnerability of Bitcoin holders, stressing the irreversible nature of transactions once private keys are compromised. Unlike traditional banking systems that offer recourse options in case of theft, he pointed out that the loss of private keys results in permanent loss of funds, painting a bleak picture of Bitcoin’s security landscape.
Questioning Bitcoin’s decentralization 
Furthermore, Roubini challenged the concept of Bitcoin’s decentralization, dismissing it as “nonsense.” He highlighted the concentration of mining power among a few significant players, which, in his view, undermines any claim to decentralization. 

“In the traditional financial system, there’s massive scalability. Yes, we have a centralized system. Bitcoin, first of all, is not secure. <…> It’s not even decentralized. <…> This idea of decentralized is nonsense. It’s neither decentralized, secure, nor scalable. It’s three NOs,” he said. 

Roubini raised concerns about the dominance of mining operations, particularly in regions with tax regulatory oversight, which threatens the network’s integrity.
Alternative to traditional finance
In addition, he rejected Bitcoin as a viable alternative to traditional financial systems, citing its purported inefficiency in handling large transaction volumes. 
The financial expert also likened storing Bitcoin to burying gold in the ground, describing it as a cumbersome and impractical solution in the digital age.
His sentiment comes amid his continued bashing of cryptocurrencies. The economist has termed crypto “totally corrupt” and the “biggest criminal heist in human history.” 
The expert has also warned of a possible “crypto apocalypse” for the industry, mainly due to regulators cracking down on the sector.

The hike in price also had a major impact on SHIB’s social metrics, as its social volume rose last week. Additionally, its weighted sentiment surged on the charts. Simply put, bullish sentiment seemed to have regained its market dominance as SHIB’s value climbed.

This outcome seems likely as the memecoin’s price was moving inside a bullish flag pattern, at press time. World of Charts, a popular crypto-analyst, recently shared a tweet about this pattern. As per the same, if SHIB manages to break above the pattern, it could result in a 100%–120% rally in the following weeks. 
Shiba Inu has more to offer
The possibility of a 100% bull rally translating into reality increased when AMBCrypto checked Glassnode’s data. We found that the memecoin’s Network to Value (NVT) ratio dipped over the last few days. 
A drop in the metric means that an asset is undervalued, hinting at a price hike in the near term.

Apart from this, investors’ confidence in SHIB remained high as buying pressure on the altcoin increased. Shiba Inu’s supply on exchanges dropped slightly while its supply outside of exchange went up, indicating buying pressure on the meme coin was high. 
Our look at CryptoQuant’s data also revealed that investors have been buying SHIB as its exchange reserves dropped.

A few indicators seemed to support the idea of a rally sustaining itself.
 For instance, the MACD projected the possibility of a bullish crossover. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) also registered an uptick and at press time, had a value of 49.7. 
AMBCrypto then checked Hyblock Capital’s data to find the immediate targets SHIB might hit on the road if it initiates a 100% rally. As per our analysis, it will be crucial for SHIB to go above $0.000025 in order to sustain the same.

If it manages to achieve that, then the next possible target could be $0.000027, as liquidation would rise sharply at that level. A successful breakout above that level could allow SHIB to hit $0.00003 soon.

SEC charges Trump Media auditor with ‘massive fraud’

An auditor associated with former president Donald Trump’s Trump Media is facing serious allegations of engaging in fraudulent activities and operating an illegitimate audit operation, as stated by the US’s leading financial regulator (SEC) on Friday.BF Borgers and its owner, Benjamin Borgers, who serves clients such as Trump Media, have been charged by the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) with a fraudulent scheme that impacted over 1,500 SEC filings. Borgers has also represented financial technology and cryptocurrency companies, as indicated by SEC filings.Trump’s media head under SEC’s reviewAs stated in the company’s most recent annual report filing, BF Borgers was named as the auditor for Trump Media on March 28. The company revealed during that period that BF Borgers had also conducted its audits prior to the company’s public debut through a merger with Digital World Acquisition Corp, a shell company with substantial funds.BF Borgers has agreed to pay a $12m civil penalty, while Benjamin Borgers has agreed to pay a $2m civil penalty, in order to settle the SEC’s civil charges. They have also agreed to permanent suspensions from practicing as accountants on SEC filings, effective immediately.It was unclear right away which filings or companies had been impacted.The company had previously gone through at least two other auditors — one that resigned the account in July 2023 and another that was terminated by the board in March, just as it was re-hiring BF Borgers.In a statement, Trump Media expressed its anticipation of collaborating with new auditing partners in compliance with the recent SEC order.As per the SEC, Borgers failed to adequately prepare and maintain audit documentation, falsely claimed to have conducted audit planning meetings, and at times used previous audits as if they were for the current audit period.According to Gurbir Grewal, director of the SEC’s division of enforcement, Ben Borgers and his audit firm, BF Borgers, were involved in a significant failure by gatekeepers in our financial markets.As a result of their fraudulent conduct, they not only put investors and markets at risk by causing public companies to incorporate non-compliant audits and reviews into more than 1,500 filings with the commission but also undermined trust and confidence in our markets.
The SECSEC’s stand on BF BorgersOut of 369 clients served by BF Borgers, a significant majority of their filings from January 2021 through June 2023 included audits that did not meet the SEC’s regulations.BF Borgers’ shortcuts involved the unethical practice of duplicating audit documentation from a previous year, altering important dates, and presenting it as current documentation. Furthermore, the fabricated documentation not only included records of work that was never performed, but also falsely claimed that planning meetings with clients took place and misrepresented that both Benjamin Borgers and another reviewer had endorsed the audit work.During the period of the SEC’s complaint, BF Borgers represented Trump Media. In late March, Trump Media merged with a publicly traded shell company, Digital World Acquisition Corp, in a deal that valued the social network at close to $8bn. The company now trades under the ticker symbol “DJT,” using the initials of its founder.Shares of Trump Media have experienced a significant decline since their initial launch. However, despite doubts about the value of the social media platform and the company’s financial challenges, the stock has continued to greatly enhance the wealth of the former president.The share price of Trump Media experienced a decline of over 5% on Friday but ultimately closed the day with a decrease of 1.54%. However, it has shown an overall increase of nearly 14% over the past five trading days. The company’s current valuation exceeds $6.5 billion. As the company’s largest shareholder, Trump recently qualified for a bonus based on the company’s share performance. This boosted the paper value of his stake to $3.7bn.

More than half of the Fortune 100 uses Apple’s Vision Pro headset

Apple’s Vision Pro headset, a mixed-reality spatial computing device, has been adopted by a majority of Fortune 100 companies with more than half purchasing at least one. Company CEO Tim Cook relayed the information during Apple’s first quarter 2024 earnings call, citing Vision Pro adoption as a sign of increased enthusiasm for the company’s products:“For example, more than half of the Fortune 100 companies have already bought Apple Vision Pro units and are exploring innovative ways to use it to do things that weren't possible before.”The Vision Pro launched in early February of 2024 with a price tag of $3,499 in the United States. In the time since, it doesn’t appear to have made much of a dent in the consumer market where much lower priced options such as Meta’s Quest line of VR headsets. As Cointelegraph recently reported, however, the Vision Pro headset and Apple’s lead in the spatial computing arena have it poised to bring the metaverse mainstream and become the default choice for enterprise adoption. Where the most popular headsets tend to offer virtual reality experiences featuring total immersion in a digital space, the Vision Pro is designed for mixed and augmented reality experiences combining the real world and digital imagery. Apple refers to this as spatial computing. VIDEOInstead of featuring the device as a gaming and social product, the companies adopting the Vision Pro appear to be using it for metaverse-related enterprise functions. One such example involves using the headset to help train doctors to perform surgeries when cadavers aren’t readily available. Cook also teased an upcoming update during the earnings call, stating that the Fortune 100 adoption is “just the beginning.” He then added that “Looking ahead, we're getting ready for an exciting product announcement next week that we think our customers will love.” It’s unclear if this will be related to Vision Pro — rumors have the Vision Pro 2 launching in 2026 with a less expensive model arriving in the interim. If true, the timing of Apple’s next event, dubbed “Let Loose,” on May 7, could be perfect for the company to announce a cheaper Vision Pro for 2025.

Dogecoin’s Astronomical Flight To $1 Price Looks Nigh As Tesla Officially Adds DOGE Payment Option ⋆ ZyCrypto

&nbsp

&nbsp
Elon Musk’s favorite cryptocurrency, Dogecoin (DOGE), has formally been included on Tesla’s website as one of the EV maker’s official modes of payment.



The price of DOGE has soared double digits over the past day to cross $0.16 as the wider crypto market experiences a sharp recovery. The meme coin’s upswing today has led to enthusiasts questioning whether this marks the beginning of a full-fledged bull rally.



DOGE Appears Among Payment Methods On the Tesla Website



Tesla’s payments page has been updated to officially include the original meme coin, Dogecoin (DOGE).



Notably, Elon Musk’s electric vehicle manufacturer only accepts DOGE for certain merchandise in the online Tesla Store. The addition notes that “Dogecoin may also be accepted on select products.” To purchase an item, buyers simply need to send DOGE to Tesla’s Dogecoin wallet address and make the payment.



On the website, Tesla clarifies that it supports only Dogecoin payments, and any other “non-Dogecoin digital assets sent to Tesla will not be returned to the purchaser.”

&nbsp



Dogecoin, with a market value of $23 billion, was created in 2013 as a mere joke, but the doggy-themed meme token has a semi-serious place in Musk’s heart. Tesla started accepting DOGE payments for its company merchandise in early 2022. Later that year, Musk’s aerospace company SpaceX also began accepting DOGE for merch. In March this year, he hinted that Tesla cars could be purchased using DOGE “at some point” in the future.



Though the eccentric billionaire no longer posts about Dogecoin as much, his cheerleading on X (formerly known as Twitter) spurred Dogecoin’s meteoric climb in 2021. DOGE hit its current all-time high of $0.73 on May 8, 2021, ahead of Musk’s appearance on SNL.



$1 Dogecoin Price In View



DOGE price has climbed over 15.9% over the last 24 hours to trade for $0.1623 at publication time on the major Tesla news.



Meanwhile, Musk’s “everything app” X is anticipated to integrate cryptocurrencies like DOGE in its upcoming payment feature, given his apparent infatuation with the canine-themed crypto.



Looking ahead, Dogecoin supporters remain optimistic about the meme cryptocurrency’s future price prospects. If it continues its recovery momentum, there is hope that DOGE could soon break past the $0.20 psychological resistance, paving the way for a potential rally to the coveted $1 mark and higher.

$83,000 Drained From Wells Fargo Accounts in Minutes - Customers Say Bank 'Rolling Their Eyes,' Blaming Them, Refusing To Reimburse - The Daily Hodl


								Two Wells Fargo customers are calling out the banking giant after scammers ripped tens of thousands of dollars from their accounts in a matter of minutes.
Jolinda Crocker says $60,000 was ripped from her account while she was teaching at her music school in Italy, reports the Daily Mail.










Crocker says she received a text message from the bank asking her to call and verify whether she had made two transactions, one for $24,973 and another for about $10,000.
She promptly called the bank, filed an online fraud report and thought everything was fine.
But a week and a half later, the bank began to blame Crocker stating she has initiated $60,000 in transactions herself, when her login history shows a login from Italy and another from California on the same day.
Crocker has now spent two years battling the bank to get her money back.
“It feels like everybody is just rolling their eyes. $60,000 is nothing to Wells Fargo but it’s my life savings.”
The story is similar to that of Judy Barr, who lost $23,865 to criminals pretending to be with Wells Fargo’s fraud department.
The scammers, who somehow had Barr’s social security number and personal banking details, sent an authorization code to Barr’s phone and asked her to repeat the numbers.
Now, the bank says Barr essentially initiated the transactions herself and refuses to reimburse.
“I was so embarrassed I didn’t even want to meet my friends for dinner. I felt like such an idiot. I was a Wells Fargo customer for over 20 years yet they have refused to take any responsibility. They put me through endless loops trying to get my money back.”
Wells Fargo is one of several large US banks facing lawsuits from customers who claim the financial giants have lax security measures, don’t properly verify large transactions and shrug their shoulders as fraudulent transactions are reported in real time.

Cardano (ADA) Historical Trends Suggest Parabolic Bull Run, Says Analyst | Cryptoglobe


                                
Crypto analyst Ali Martinez recently published an interesting thread on social media platform X (formerly known as Twitter) about Cardano (ADA), in which he analyzed historical price trends and compared them with the current market situation. According to him, the 50% price drop in ADA over the past month could be a great buying opportunity, as Cardano seems to be preparing for a parabolic bull run. Let’s take a closer look at his analysis.



In 2019, Martinez says Cardano consolidated within a parallel channel, signaling the end of the bear market. He went on to say that following this stagnation, the ADA price broke out of the channel with a 75% surge, followed by a 56% price correction, which set the stage for an impressive 4,095% bull run.



He also mentions that a similar situation occurred in 2023. Cardano again consolidated within a parallel channel, marking the end of another bear market. After this period of stagnation, the ADA price broke out of the channel with a 72% surge. Now, Cardano is undergoing a 50% price correction.







Martinez believes that while history doesn’t repeat itself, it often rhymes. Per his thread, if this rule holds true for Cardano, investors should prepare for what lies ahead. He adds that the current price correction could be one of the last opportunities to buy ADA at a low price before a new parabolic rise.



Of course, it’s important to remember that past performance does not guarantee future results. Technical analysis is a powerful tool, but it doesn’t provide 100% certainty; as usual, investors should always conduct their own research and weigh potential risks and rewards before making investment decisions.







            
            

            
            

            
            

        

On April 18, Frederik Gregaard, CEO of the Cardano Foundation, revealed plans for a new governance structure for the Cardano blockchain, marking a critical development phase. The Cardano Foundation, headquartered in Zug, Switzerland, plays a vital role in overseeing the Cardano ecosystem. It focuses on various functions, including adoption, shaping policy, community expansion, ensuring stakeholder accountability, and fostering partnerships.



Gregaard announced the creation of an interim constitution aimed at laying the foundation for decentralized governance, underlining the importance of community involvement in determining the future of the ecosystem. This constitution encapsulates the core values of the global Cardano community, promoting transparency, openness, and responsible decision-making. It also ensures that every ADA holder has a voice in the ecosystem, making the governance structure inclusive and representative.



Additionally, the interim constitution outlines the rights, privileges, and responsibilities of all ADA holders, developers, and community members, emphasizing a fair voting system to maintain true ownership and participation. Gregaard also discussed the introduction of checks and balances within the governance system, involving delegates, stake pool operators, and a constitutional committee to reflect community will, uphold the constitution, and protect the ecosystem’s integrity.



The governance model is currently in a testing phase, with plans for a final constitution to be developed through global workshops and a constitutional convention in late 2024. These initiatives are intended to engage the community actively in refining governance strategies. Gregaard sees the constitution as evolving with the community and is enthusiastic about the future of Cardano’s governance, highlighting the blockchain’s model as an industry benchmark.

New York Resident Charged in $43 Million Crypto-Related Ponzi Scheme


																A New York court and the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) have revealed an indictment against Idin Dalpour.
The 39-year-old New York resident is accused of organizing a sophisticated Ponzi scheme that allegedly defrauded investors of $43 million.
$43 Million Ponzi Scheme
According to the indictment, he ran the Ponzi scheme from approximately 2020 through April 2024. He targeted investors in the United States and abroad, soliciting investments through an entity he controlled called “Entity-1.”
This entity had interests in two business ventures: a cryptocurrency trading operation and a Las Vegas hospitality enterprise. Dalpour falsely claimed to purchase cryptocurrency at wholesale prices and sell it at a profit to retail investors promising substantial returns with assurances of safety and insurance for their investments.
He also claimed Entity-1 had deals with a management company and a top Las Vegas hotel to rent condos to visitors.




Investors were lured into the scheme with promises of substantial returns, with initial rates advertised at 42% per year. Dalpour allegedly provided investors with fabricated contracts, email correspondence, and bank statements to support his false claims about the profitability and legitimacy of the ventures.
The indictment outlines that Dalpour did not use investors’ funds as promised. Instead, he used the money contributed by later investors to pay earlier participants their returns.
Dalpour also reportedly used investor funds for personal expenses, including gambling losses totaling approximately $1.7 million, expenditures from Art Direct amounting to over $400,000, and private school tuition for his children.
When investors sought to recover their investments, he reportedly provided false explanations, including claims of frozen funds due to a hack of the Hotel’s servers and non-existent bank accounts.
Dalpour Faces Upto 20 Years in Prison
The indictment also details a confrontation in November 2023, where Dalpour reportedly confessed to lying about the operation of the Las Vegas hospitality business, the misuse of investor funds, and the fabrication of contracts and bank records.
During this encounter, Dalpour said, “What you already have, you have, you can put me in jail now, like right now.”
Dalpour’s arrest marks a significant step in the investigation, If convicted, he faces a maximum sentence of 20 years in prison for wire fraud.
The Securities and Commodities Fraud Task Force of the Southern District of New York is handling the case. Dalpour will appear in Manhattan federal court before U.S. Magistrate Judge Barbara Moses.

Automobile Giant Tesla Updated Payment Information: There is New Dogecoin Detail - Bitcoin Sistemi


Tesla, one of the world's largest electric car manufacturers, also included Dogecoin (DOGE) detail in an update made in the payment section of its official website.
According to the official website, American Express, Discover, Mastercard, Visa and Apple Pay payment options are used when purchasing Tesla products. However, Tesla also stated in the note he added that Dogecoin can be used for some products.


According to the cryptocurrency community, Dogecoin was not previously mentioned among the payment options. However, DOGE cannot be used to purchase Tesla cars. It can only be used to purchase certain products.

Users who want to purchase Tesla products with DOGE are given a price showing the DOGE equivalent of the product for a certain period of time, but this is valid for a short time. The price needs to be updated after some time. It is known that the reason for this is the volatility of DOGE.





However, it is not currently possible to purchase any of Tesla products with Bitcoin. For a while, even Tesla cars could be purchased with BTC.

Dogecoin Price Slides Amidst Crypto Market Correction, But Will it Bounce Back and Take on Shiba Inu?



                    

Dogecoin‘s value has taken a hit amidst a broader decline in the cryptocurrency market. On April 27, DOGE saw a decrease of 4.82%, settling at approximately $0.15.



This decline was more pronounced compared to the overall crypto market, which experienced a 2.25% drop on the same day. 




Over the past month, Dogecoin has plummeted by 38% from its recent peak of $0.229.



The recent downturn in Dogecoin’s price can be attributed to several factors, with one significant influence being the release of the U.S. gross domestic product (GDP) report on April 25. 



The U.S. economy’s growth in the first quarter of 2024 fell short of expectations, recording a 1.6% increase instead of the anticipated 2.5%. 



Additionally, there was only a 0.3% rise in personal consumption expenditures for March.



Consequently, expectations for Federal Reserve interest rate cuts in 2024 have been revised down to just 33 basis points, a considerable reduction from earlier projections.



The anticipation of sustained high interest rates has led to a rise in the yield on the benchmark U.S. 10-year Treasury note, reaching 4.739% on April 24, its highest level in five months. 



This increase has made riskier crypto assets less appealing to investors. For instance, on the day when the yield peaked, five spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) experienced outflows totaling $217 million.

Furthermore, Dogecoin’s open interest (OI) has declined to $865.63 million on April 27 from its peak of $2.21 billion nearly a month ago. 




Additionally, the funding rate has dropped to 0.0063% per eight hours. 



These developments indicate a prevailing bearish sentiment in the market, with traders adopting a cautious stance due to uncertainty surrounding Dogecoin’s future price movements or reduced interest in high leverage trading.



Today’s decrease in Dogecoin’s price appears to be a continuation of a selling trend that started when the price encountered resistance marked by a descending trendline and the 50-day exponential moving average (50-day EMA). 



The descending trendline resistance has consistently hindered DOGE’s upward movements over the past 30 days. 



Currently, the cryptocurrency is testing its multi-week ascending trendline support, suggesting a potential rebound that could propel the price towards the descending trendline resistance at around $0.159 by the end of April.

$2,000,000,000,000 - $3,000,000,000,000 Wealth Transfer Happening This Year As ‘Largest Move of Assets in World History’ Approaches Climax: Report - The Daily Hodl


								Big Four accounting firm Ernst & Young (EY) says the greatest transfer of wealth in human history is in motion, with trillions of dollars in assets passed down this year.
In its Global Wealth Management Industry Report, EY estimates baby boomers will hand down up to $3 trillion in assets to their kin this year.










EY expects the “tidal wave” of wealth transfer from baby boomers to their families to continue until the dawn of a new decade.
“It can be estimated that US$2 trillion – $3 trillion will be inherited from wealthy donors during 2024; in many markets, tens or even hundreds of billions [of dollars] will change hands this year. In 2023, more billionaires were created by inheritance than by entrepreneurship.
The inheritance of baby boomers’ wealth is not only the largest transfer of assets in world history; it will also have a transformative effect on female and next-generation inheritors. Wealthy donors will pass a staggering US$18 trillion, roughly equivalent to the annual GDP of China, to beneficiaries by 2030.” 
The firm’s $18 trillion wealth transfer is significantly lower than estimates released by other firms. Global real estate consultancy firm Knight Frank believes baby boomers will pass down $90 trillion to millennials in the next two decades while others estimate the number to be between $53 trillion and $84 trillion.
Amid the “unprecedented” movement of assets, EY warns that the beneficiaries are not equipped with the necessary knowledge, experience and network to manage their new-found wealth.
“No two clients are alike, but many wealthy donors have features in common. Most are male, aged 70 or over, have benefited from decades of favorable markets and have long-standing wealth manager relationships.
In contrast, inheritors’ needs and values – and banking relationships – are far more diverse and underserved.
The first beneficiaries are often female, frequently with less exposure to managing wealth. This is a client segment whose requirements and preferences have often been less well-served than their male counterparts in the past. Younger generations, too, typically have very different goals from older donors. This includes factors such as the internationalization of wealthy families, less traditional family structures, lower financial literacy and more idiosyncratic investment beliefs.”

New Solana Memecoin Skinny Doge (SKINDOGE) to Surge 7,100% and Challenge Shiba Inu and Dogecoin



                    

Skinny Doge (SKINDOGE) could become a viral memecoin, like Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE).



Skinny Doge (SKINDOGE), a Solana memecoin that was launched this week, is aiming to challenge other memecoin giants, such as Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE).




Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Skinny Doge presents a similar opportunity.



Skinny Doge has market cap below $13,000 at the moment, meaning that when it just reaches a modest market cap of $200,000-$500,000, early investors would generate returns of 2,000%-5,000% in a matter of days or hours.



The exciting memecoin is poised to rally 7,100% in the coming two days, and Skinny Doge could potentially reach a multi-million dollar market cap within a few weeks.




Currently, Skinny Doge can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jupiter and Raydium, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days.



To buy Skinny Doge on these platforms, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Skinny Doge by entering its contract address – 913qkdtENF3qvSBZjtoNxETZi93xHgRDuHNGvdzkECF4 – in the receiving field.



In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price.



If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner.




The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum.



This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like SKINDOGE.

itcoin: The Teenage Prodigy of the Financial World? | Cryptoglobe


                                
Introduction In a recent post on X (formerly Twitter), Nate Geraci, President of the ETF Store, shared an intriguing description of Bitcoin, originally coined by Eric Balchunas, Senior ETF Analyst at Bloomberg. The metaphor, “It’s like gold, but as a teenager,” sparked an engaging discussion among followers, shedding light on the unique characteristics and potential of the world’s most prominent cryptocurrency.



Balchunas’ comparison of Bitcoin to a teenage version of gold is a fascinating way to frame the digital asset’s position in the financial landscape. Gold has long been considered a reliable store of value, with a history of stability and resilience during economic turmoil. Bitcoin, on the other hand, is a relatively new player in the world of finance, having emerged in 2009.



Much like a teenager, Bitcoin is still growing, learning, and experiencing the volatility that comes with maturation. Its value fluctuates more dramatically than that of gold, and it is subject to the whims and speculations of a rapidly evolving market. However, just as a teenager holds immense potential for growth and development, Bitcoin has the capacity to revolutionize the way we think about money and transactions.



One insightful reply to Geraci’s post took the metaphor a step further, painting a picture of Bitcoin as the son of gold, a father who “had issues and paid no attention to his son.” This poignant analogy highlights the challenges Bitcoin has faced in its journey to legitimacy and widespread adoption.



Unlike gold, which has the backing of governments and centuries of trust, Bitcoin had to forge its own path. It emerged from the shadows of the internet, born out of a desire for a decentralized, transparent, and secure financial system. Bitcoin’s growth has been marked by trial and error, with the cryptocurrency community learning from its mistakes and adapting to the ever-changing landscape of digital assets.







            
            

            
            

            
            

        

Balchunas’ response to the father-son analogy likened Bitcoin to Generation X in 1994. This comparison is apt, as it reflects the rebellious and innovative spirit that defines both Gen X and Bitcoin. In the early 1990s, Gen X was coming of age, challenging the status quo, and embracing new technologies that would shape the future.



Similarly, Bitcoin emerged as a disruptive force in the world of finance, offering an alternative to traditional banking systems and fiat currencies. Its decentralized nature and the underlying blockchain technology have the potential to revolutionize not only financial transactions but also various industries, from supply chain management to voting systems.



The metaphor of Bitcoin as a teenage version of gold resonated with many readers, with one commenter noting that it “not only makes Bitcoin more relatable but also encapsulates its dynamic and transformative nature in the financial landscape.” As Bitcoin continues to mature and gain acceptance, it has the potential to reshape the way we think about money and value.



Another reply highlighted the similarities between Bitcoin and gold as a store of value, stating that while gold is more established and stable, Bitcoin similarly appeals to those seeking alternative investments.

Shiba Inu Community Alert: TREAT Token Release Misinformation Sparks Urgent Caution



                    

The Shiba Inu community is currently on high alert due to the spread of misinformation surrounding the release of the TREAT token. 



Shibarmy Scam Alerts, a dedicated source for uncovering scams within the community, has issued an urgent warning. 




They emphasize that the TREAT token has not been officially launched and refute recent claims suggesting otherwise. 



According to them, the SHIB team has not initiated any official release of the token. As a precautionary measure, the Shiba Inu community is urged to exercise caution and refrain from participating in any transactions or investments related to TREAT until its official release is confirmed by legitimate sources. 



It is advised to safeguard assets by avoiding unauthorized TREAT-related activities and prioritizing financial security.




In recent developments, Shiba Inu has secured $12 million from strategic VC partners led by Cypher Capital to facilitate the launch of its next-generation Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE) blockchain, which will be powered by the forthcoming TREAT token.

The FHE technology, enabling computations on encrypted data, promises significant advancements in privacy and trust within the cryptocurrency sphere. 



However, amidst the anticipation, there are considerable risks associated with the TREAT token, prompting the issuance of the urgent alert.




The Shiba Inu community is reminded to disregard any claims of the TREAT token’s release, as no such action has been initiated by the SHIB team. 



Official announcements should be relied upon for accurate information regarding the TREAT launch. 



In other significant news for the ecosystem, the decentralized exchange ShibaSwap has completed its migration to Shibarium from Ethereum, marking a milestone in its progress. 



This move is expected to bring forth innovations and new possibilities for the ShibaSwap platform within the Shibarium blockchain environment.

Crypto Venture Capital Trends: Q1 2024 Analysis by Galaxy Digital Research | Cryptoglobe


                                
In a recent research report titled “Crypto & Blockchain Venture Capital – Q1 2024” by Galaxy Digital, it was highlighted that while digital asset markets have shown significant recovery from the lows of 2023, venture capital investment in the sector has not kept pace with previous bull market trends. Galaxy Digital noted that venture capital dollars are trailing, unlike in the 2017 and 2021 bull runs, where there was a high correlation with liquid crypto asset prices. Several factors contribute to this stagnation, including high interest rates, which dampen risk appetite, a lingering reluctance in the crypto market following the 2022 blowups, and a scarcity of later-stage companies capable of absorbing large venture investments. As a result, early-stage companies have attracted the most interest, both in terms of capital and deal count, with a modest quarter-on-quarter increase in total capital invested and a 50% rise in deal count, mainly at the Series A stage or earlier.



Galaxy Digital’s report also points out that the trend towards early-stage investment is a positive indicator for the long-term health of the cryptocurrency ecosystem. These companies are often at the forefront of developing new technologies, including scaling solutions, games, and tools that integrate artificial intelligence with blockchain technology. Despite challenges in raising capital for later-stage ventures, the flourishing of innovative projects suggests a vibrant and evolving landscape.



The introduction of spot-based Bitcoin ETFs in the United States is another focal point of the report. According to Galaxy Digital, these ETFs provide an accessible, low-fee, and highly liquid means for investors to gain exposure to Bitcoin. However, this ease of access could potentially divert interest away from crypto startups, as these ETFs fulfill some investors’ need for exposure to the crypto market, potentially impacting venture investments in crypto-linked equities.



With regards to specific blockchain technologies, Galaxy Digital highlights significant venture capital interest in Bitcoin Layer 2 projects during Q1 2024. The development of new token standards on Bitcoin, such as BRC-20 and Runes, and the application of technologies pioneered in the Ethereum ecosystem, like optimistic and zk rollups, have piqued investor interest. This shift views Bitcoin not just as a monetary system but as a platform network supporting a variety of applications.







            
            

            
            

            
            

        

The report by Galaxy Digital further explores the distribution of venture capital across different sectors within the blockchain space. While Web3 and Trading categories continue to dominate in terms of deal count and capital raised, the Infrastructure category has seen substantial growth, becoming the leader in capital raised and second in deal count in Q1 2024. This includes investments in tools like staking, re-staking services, and platform tools, with notable rounds such as EigenLayer’s $100 million financing.



Moreover, Galaxy Digital comments on the challenges faced by fund managers in the current economic climate, noting a downturn in the size of funds and the capital allocated to them since the tumult of 2022. However, a slight uptick in the number of new funds indicates emerging opportunities and continued growth in crypto prices and adoption could rejuvenate investor confidence and funding activities.



Finally, the United States remains at the forefront of the crypto startup ecosystem, though regulatory challenges could potentially drive some operations overseas. Galaxy Digital underscores the importance of thoughtful policymaking to maintain the U.S. as a hub for technological innovation and to support the continuing development of the cryptocurrency and blockchain ecosystem.

Veteran Analyst Peter Brandt: 8 Trading Tips for Crypto Traders


A seasoned market analyst, Peter Brandt, offers a rigorous guide for those looking to dive full-time into crypto trading. 
With years of trading experience, Brandt outlines essential tips aimed at aspiring traders who wish to transition from day jobs to trading as their primary source of income.
8 Tips for Crypto Traders by Peter Brandt
Firstly, Brandt emphasizes the importance of genuine trading skills over luck. Aspiring crypto traders should rely on their abilities rather than hoping a single market bet will pay off. He advises traders to ensure they have substantial account capital. 
“Multiply your needed living expenses by five,” Brandt suggests, highlighting the need for financial stability derived from actual profits, not loans or savings.
Additionally, Brandt stresses the importance of having enough savings outside one’s trading account to cover living expenses for up to two years. This is crucial considering the possibility of losing money in the first year. 

“[Novice traders] risk way too much of the $100,000 per trade. Risking more much more than 2% per trade is a recipe for failure. The only solution in my mind is a commitment to a marathon and not a sprint,” Brandt added.

Brandt also recommends paper trading for at least a year to refine one’s trading approach, focusing on the minute details that often determine success or failure.
Understanding the low success rate among crypto traders is also vital. Only about 3% to 5% of those who try to trade full-time actually succeed, according to Brandt. He challenges traders, saying, “Prove me wrong, and then let me know where I was wrong after two years.”
Brandt also tackles a common misconception in trading. Especially the need for a large starting capital. He argues that success in trading does not correlate with the size of one’s capital. In fact, starting small can help traders quickly identify and rectify mistakes, which is crucial in the steep learning process of trading.


“There is a huge misconception that an aspiring trader needs a big account to be successful. Most “market wizards” would tell you that if you cannot be profitable with a small amt of capital, then you won’t be profitable with more. Actually, with a smaller account mistakes become self apparent sooner. Successful trading occurs when a person climbs a steep wall of learning by making mistakes,” Brandt concluded.

Brandt’s insights provide a robust framework for crypto traders aiming to make a significant shift in their professional lives, emphasizing that successful trading is about solving problems and learning from mistakes, not just having a strong start.

Kitty With Hat (KITHAT) to Rally Over 13,000% Ahead of MEXC Listing, While Shiba Inu, Bonk and Dogecoin Lag



                    

Early investors in memecoins like Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) made astronomical returns, and Kitty With Hat (KITHAT) presents a similar opportunity for a limited time.



Kitty With Hat (KITHAT), a newly launched Solana memecoin, is poised to explode over 13,000% in a matter of days, as former Shiba Inu (SHIB), Bonk (BONK) and Dogecoin (DOGE) investors pour funds into this new token.




KITHAT will be listed on MEXC, one of the largest centralized exchanges in the world, within a few days – and this is a massively bullish development for the token, as millions of new investors will easily be able to buy Kitty With Hat.



Currently, Kitty With Hat can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jupiter and Raydium, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days.



To buy KITHAT on these platforms, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Homo Pepe by entering its contract address – 3Wdkgv1iTBQQ9MnvA4TkAefe2SLdtSKfHwZbhKcEMZk8 – in the receiving field.




KITHAT currently has a market cap of just under $10,000, with over $4,000 in locked liquidity, meaning it has huge upside potential.



Early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and Bonk (BONK) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price.



If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner.

The Top Layer 2 Networks by Development Activity in April


																While the crypto market witnessed significant bloodshed in April, layer-2 networks recorded substantial developer activity, signaling a strong belief in these projects despite the latest slumps in the value of their native tokens.
A tweet by crypto data analytics platform Santiment revealed that the top ten layer-2 networks were selected by counting each project’s non-redundant GitHub activity and averaging their daily activity over the past 30 days.
According to Santiment, analysts obtained the projects’ GitHub activities from their repositories through a back-tested process to ensure that only the teams’ efforts to improve and innovate were included. A project’s GitHub activity can be used to determine whether the team is actively working on the protocol. High developer activity could also reduce the probability that a project is an exit scam.
Through Santiment’s methodology, analysts discovered that Ethereum-based scaling protocol Optimism emerged as the top network with the highest developer activity of 541.33 commits, 146% more than the next project. Conversely, its native token, OP, plunged more than 17% in the last 30 days.
Following Optimism is the permissionless decentralized zero knowledge-rollup network Starknet, which recorded a developer activity of 220.23. Despite Starknet’s high activity, its native token, STRK, lost roughly 36% of its value in April.




Arbitrum came third with a developer activity of 110.77, while its native asset, ARB, fell 32% within the same period. Next is the modular scaling protocol Cartesi, Immutable X, and Skale Network, which came fourth, fifth, and sixth, with developer activities of 56.97, 49.07, and 28.07, respectively. Their native assets also witnessed notable declines, running into double digits.
The last four projects on the list are Bitcoin layer-2 sidechain MintLayer, and Ethereum-based networks Polygon, MetisDAO, and Mantle, with developer activities of 23.53, 20.43, 7.87, and 5.33. Like other projects, their native tokens also recorded substantial losses in April.

Shiba Inu Scores Another Major Listing That Could Send Price Flying


								Shiba Inu has scored another major listing as PayPal users within the United States can now buy the dog-themed cryptocurrency through MoonPay, opening up new avenues for adoption and potentially fueling a price increase. 
PayPal Teams Up With MoonPay For Shiba Inu Access
American multinational financial technology company PayPal has made a strategic partnership with MoonPay, a crypto payment platform, allowing US users to access cryptocurrency assets like Shiba Inu. MoonPay made the exciting announcement on X (formerly Twitter), revealing that PayPal can now offer seamless fiat-to-crypto transactions within the US. 

The integration of MoonPay’s services into PayPal marks a significant milestone in the democratization of cryptocurrencies in the US. MoonPay has disclosed that it will allow PayPal users to purchase over 110 cryptocurrencies, including doggy-themed cryptocurrency, Shiba Inu. 
Through the collaboration, millions of users in all 50 states of the US will be exposed to Shiba Inu tokens, presenting a step forward in the cryptocurrency’s vision for mainstream adoption. This could in turn potentially drive up the price of the cryptocurrency as it attracts new investors from different parts of the country. 
Moreover, after the announcement of the partnership, the price of Shiba Inu surged considerably. The cryptocurrency jumped from $0.000022 to $0.000024 in just a day, increasing by 7.72% over the past 24 hours, according to CoinMarketCap. 
MoonPay has outlined the process for users to access its extensive library of cryptocurrencies via PayPal, disclosing that new MoonPay users with a PayPal account can seamlessly conduct online cryptocurrency transactions.

The crypto payment platform disclosed that PayPal users can fund their crypto accounts through different channels including direct bank withdrawal, PayPal balance, and debit card. 
Welcoming the pivotal partnership, MoonPay’s co-founder and Chief Executive Officer (CEO), Ivan Soto-Wright, emphasized the importance of the alliance, aimed at facilitating broader cryptocurrency adoption within familiar ecosystems. 
He disclosed that MoonPay’s integration into PayPal underscores the crypto platform’s deep commitment to expanding access to cryptocurrencies through trusted networks.
MoonPay Set To Transform PayPal Crypto Access
Including Shiba Inu, MoonPay will also grant PayPal users within the US access to top cryptocurrencies like Solana (SOL), Ethereum (ETH), Dogecoin (DOGE), Bitcoin (BTC), and others. Additionally, the crypto service platform has revealed that other crypto assets initially available on its platform such as Pepe (PEPE), Cosmos (ATOM), Toncoin (TON), Binance Coin (BNB) and a few more, will not be accessible to US users. 
MoonPay has also revealed key benefits it will be offering PayPal through its crypto services, including flexible payment methods, an extensive variety of cryptocurrencies, seamless onboarding, transactional speed, and other user-friendly features. 

Furthermore, the crypto platform has hinted that in the third quarter (Q3) of 2024, it plans to integrate PayPal into its partner networks, expanding opportunities for the adoption of cryptocurrencies like Shiba Inu, which could potentially boost the token’s value.

New Global Currency Designed To Ditch US Dollar, Avert Sanctions Emerging As BRICS Leaders Prepare To Meet: Report - The Daily Hodl


								A group of economically-aligned nations known as BRICS is reportedly hammering out the details on a new currency designed to drop dependence on the US dollar.
South African Ambassador to China Siyabonga Cyprian Cwele says BRICS members will meet this month to discuss the specifics, reports the Chinese state-backed Global Times.










On the agenda is a debate on whether a digital currency would effectively facilitate global trade and settlement while reducing the risk of sanctions.
“The BRICS are advancing the progress of its common currency, while actively promoting the use of local currencies from member states to reduce the risks of solely relying on the US dollar…
Cwele stressed the importance of supporting the use of local currencies with open financial data sharing, while looking into digital currencies as ways to explore multiple and stable mechanisms for trade and settlement to reduce the risks such as sanction by just relying on a singular currency.”
The push for a new currency comes amid a period of expansion for BRICS, which stands for Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa.
Last year, the organization added Saudi Arabia, Iran, Ethiopia, Egypt and the United Arab Emirates.
And according to Cwele, more than 20 additional countries have now “expressed an interest” in joining.
Cwele says BRICS leaders are working to create new guidelines for adding additional countries that are non-discriminatory and address issues aside from economics.

CZ gets jail sentence, Gensler viewed Ether as security, and FBI targets mixers: Hodler’s Digest, April 28 - May 4 - Cointelegraph Magazine


            
Top Stories This Week



Ex-Binance CEO Changpeng Zhao sentenced to four months in prison



Former Binance CEO Changpeng “CZ” Zhao has been sentenced to four months in prison for failing to maintain an effective Anti-Money Laundering program at the cryptocurrency exchange. The sentence was delivered by Judge Richard Jones in the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Washington on April 30, following Zhao’s guilty plea in November. Although prosecutors initially sought a three-year prison term, Judge Jones decided on a shorter sentence, noting that there was no evidence Zhao was directly informed of specific illegal activities at Binance.



SEC and Gensler believed Ether was security for at least a year



The lawsuit filed by Consensys against the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has revealed details about the Commission’s view of Ether as a security. Based on court documents, the SEC and its chair, Gary Gensler, have reportedly considered Ether to be an “unregistered security” not in compliance with federal regulations for at least a year. The revelation is part of Consensys response to a Wells notice from the SEC with an unredacted complaint in a Texas federal court.



FBI warning against crypto money transmitters ‘appears’ to be aimed at mixers



An advisory issued by U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation against using unregistered cryptocurrency money-transmitting services may be targeting smart-contract privacy tools, according to legal professionals. On April 25, the FBI issued a public service announcement advising Americans to only use registered crypto businesses that adhere to Know Your Customer and Anti-Money Laundering regulations. The FBI highlighted that it had taken action against unlicensed cryptocurrency services, warning that users of such services could face financial disruptions, especially if their funds are mixed with those obtained illegally.







Bitcoin post-halving price consolidation could last 2 months — Bitfinex



Bitfinex analysts predict that Bitcoin may enter a one to two-month period of price consolidation following the halving event, with potential price fluctuations of up to $10,000. According to the report, Bitcoin is expected to remain a key benchmark for price action in the crypto market throughout May and serve as a primary indicator for the overall market cap. Lastly, the report adds that any positive impact on Bitcoin’s price following the halving will be seen in later months.



Hong Kong Bitcoin, Ether ETFs attract over $200M on day 1

Prediction of the week



Bitcoin bottom in, now headed for a ‘slow grind higher’ — Arthur Hayes



Former BitMEX CEO Arthur Hayes believes Bitcoin has hit a local bottom and will slowly grind back up over the next few months. In a blog post on May 3, Hayes commented on the recent market slump, claiming that “The price action played out as I expected.”



Bitcoin hit a local low of around $58,600 earlier this week but will rally to above $60,000 and then remain rangebound between $60,000 and $70,000 until August, he said.



Hayes expects crypto markets to slowly grind higher after the recent sell-off, driven by increased dollar liquidity from the Federal Reserve’s quantitative tightening taper and the U.S. Treasury’s debt issuance plans.



“The slow addition of billions of dollars of liquidity each month will dampen negative price movement from here on out,” he added before predicting that prices will “bottom, chop, and begin a slow grind higher.”







FUD of the Week



US Justice Dept charges Roger Ver with tax fraud



Officials with the United States Department of Justice announced charges against early Bitcoin investor Roger Ver, known by many as “Bitcoin Jesus.” In an April 30 notice, the Justice Department said authorities in Spain had arrested Ver based on criminal charges in the U.S., including mail fraud, tax evasion and filing false tax returns.

Bitcoin Relative Strength Jumps To 40%: 10x Research Reveals Next Steps From Here


                            Crypto research platform 10x Research recently noted that the Bitcoin Relative Strength has jumped to 40%. In line with this, they provided insights into what major moves the flagship crypto might make soon enough. 
What Next For Bitcoin?
In their newsletter titled “Fake Dip?” 10x Research drew the crypto community’s attention to the fact that Bitcoin has historically experienced potential rallies whenever its relative strength index (RSI) drops to 40%. As such, there is the possibility that BTC could again rally following its recent decline. 

The research platform warned that a “line in the sand” at the $62,000 mark could keep the flagship crypto from rallying. However, Bitcoin has already broken above that level, which could mean there is still a bullish sentiment around the crypto token. 
Meanwhile, the research hinted that BTC would need a catalyst to enjoy a sustained rally. They highlighted four bullish events that helped Bitcoin enjoy a parabolic run soon after breaking a vital support level. These events included Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen’s bid for uncapped deposit insurance, BlackRock’s application for a Spot Bitcoin ETF, Franklin Templeton also filing for a Spot Bitcoin ETF, and when US Core PCE dropped below 3.0%.
This echoes the sentiment of Andrey Stoychev, Head of Prime Brokerage at Nexo, who previously mentioned that Bitcoin would need a catalyst to make a significant move to the upside. He predicts that Bitcoin will only continue to trade around the $67,000 range without this catalyst. 
10x Research didn’t sound optimistic about BTC enjoying a sustained rally, as their trend model indicates that the flagship crypto is in a downtrend. Despite that, they are not ruling out the possibility of BTC experiencing a bullish reversal. The research firm also revealed that they would look to buy the dip if Bitcoin drops significantly or rallies from here. 
BTC Still Destined To Hit New Highs
Crypto analyst Mikybull Crypto recently suggested that Bitcoin will still hit new highs. He stated that Bitcoin’s current price action is meant to create “more fear across the market and then bottom for upward continuation.” Crypto analyst Ali Martinez also recently suggested that the bull run was far from over, bearing in mind that Bitcoin consolidated around this period in the last two bull runs. 

He claimed that BTC might be over 500 days away from hitting its market top for this cycle. As to how BTC could rise, Martinez mentioned that it could hit a new all-time high (ATH) of $92,190 if it breaches the resistance level of $69,150. It is also worth noting that crypto analyst PlanB stated that Bitcoin hitting $100,000 this year is “inevitable.”
At the time of writing, BTC is trading at around at around $63,500, up over 7% in the last 24 hours, according to data from CoinMarketCap.

Solana Primed To Establish Itself As ‘Third Major Crypto Asset’ After Bitcoin and Ethereum: Franklin Templeton - The Daily Hodl


								Global investment giant Franklin Templeton thinks Solana (SOL) is primed to establish itself as the “third major crypto asset” after Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH).
In a new analysis, the firm’s digital assets unit notes that the Solana network has witnessed significant increases in total fees and decentralized exchange (DEX) volumes in the past year.










“We expect this growth to continue as Solana’s network effects grow stronger and its network performance improves even more, positioning itself to capture the next trends in crypto. The network has proven to have some of the lowest fees, lowest transaction latency and highest data throughput relative to other networks. This is where Solana really shines.”
SOL is trading at $143.34 at time of writing. The fifth-ranked crypto asset by market cap is up nearly 3% in the past 24 hours but down more than 22% in the past month.
Franklin Templeton also believes Solana is “uniquely qualified” to serve as the focal point of adoption for several sectors in the crypto space, including decentralized physical infrastructure (DePIN), payments, compression non-fungible tokens (NFTs) and centralized limit order books (CLOBs). In addition, the investment titan sees activity in the Solana network surging in the coming months due to potential airdrops and the resurgence of memecoin mania.
“Further, the Solana ecosystem has more expected airdrops in the coming months which should continue adding a wealth effect to the ecosystem. And memecoin activity has shown no signs of slowing down on the network.”

Grayscale Spot Bitcoin ETF Turns Positive After $17.5 Billion In Outflows, Sees Inflows For The First Time | Bitcoinist.com


								In a rather shocking development, Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) has recorded its first-ever inflow after witnessing significant daily outflows since its launch. 
Grayscale Bitcoin ETF Records Over $60 Million In Inflows
Grayscale’s Spot Bitcoin ETF has finally broken its 82-day streak of outflows since its launch on January 11, 2024. GBTC saw its first day of inflows on May 3, after witnessing approximately $17.46 billion in outflows. 

According to data from Farside, an investment management firm, Grayscale’s Spot Bitcoin ETF had amassed inflows of about $63 million, alongside other Bitcoin ETFs like BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) which had inflows of $12.7 million. 
The total inflows recorded in that single day amounted to approximately $378.3 million, with Franklin Templeton’s Spot Bitcoin ETF, EZBC, leading the pack with the highest inflows of $102.6 million. 
Expressing disbelief at Grayscale’s turnaround, Bloomberg senior analyst and ETF expert, Eric Balchunas remarked that he had to make thorough verifications to confirm the unexpected development. 
Moreover, the surprising influx comes after a recent occurrence which saw 10 US Spot Bitcoin ETFs, including BlackRock’s IBIT, collectively recording enormous outflows worth over $563.7 million in a single day. These outflows were possibly triggered by the Federal Reserve’s (FED) decision to keep rates unaltered, resulting in a broader downturn in the crypto market. 
BTC had also experienced significant declines around the same time, however, currently the cryptocurrency is up by 6.36% in the past 24 hours, jumping above $60,000 support levels to trade at $63,175, according to CoinMarketCap. 
Factors Behind GBTC’s Massive Outflows
Grayscale saw its first recorded inflow after experiencing hundreds of millions worth of daily outflows since its inception. The asset management firm’s Spot Bitcoin ETF had also experienced its highest outflow of approximately $589.9 million on February 29. 

Various factors have contributed to GBTC’s daily outflows, including its exorbitant annual management fee of 1.5%. Compared to all 12 Spot Bitcoin ETFs in the United States (US), Grayscale has the most expensive Spot Bitcoin ETF fee, exceeding even BlackRock, the second largest BTC ETF provider, which has an average annual management fee of 0.25%. 
Some of Grayscale’s outflows were also a result of a reported selling connection with insolvent crypto exchange, FTX and other defunct cryptocurrency companies. FTX had sold about $1 billion worth of GBTC while Genesis, a cryptocurrency brokerage for institutional investors had sold almost 36 million shares in GBTC to purchase 32,041 BTC worth more than $2.1 billion.

OpenAI Faces Privacy Complaint Over Chatbot Accuracy Concerns



                    

OpenAI, a leading developer in artificial intelligence (AI), finds itself embroiled in a privacy complaint brought forth by Noyb, a data rights protection advocacy group based in Austria.



Noyb launched the complaint on April 29, alleging that OpenAI has neglected to address erroneous information generated by its AI chatbot, ChatGPT. 




The group contends that this inaction may violate privacy regulations within the European Union (EU).



The complaint stems from an incident involving an unidentified public figure who sought information about themselves from OpenAI’s chatbot. 



Despite repeated requests, OpenAI purportedly declined to rectify or delete the inaccurate data, citing technical limitations. 




Furthermore, the company refused to disclose details about its training data and its origins.



Maartje de Graaf, a data protection lawyer at Noyb, emphasized the importance of adherence to legal standards in technology, stating, 



“If a system cannot produce accurate and transparent results, it cannot be used to generate data about individuals. 



‘The technology has to follow the legal requirements, not the other way around.”

Noyb escalated the complaint to the Austrian data protection authority, urging an investigation into OpenAI’s data processing practices and the mechanisms it employs to ensure the accuracy of personal data processed by its large language models.



De Graaf underscored the current challenges faced by companies in aligning chatbot technologies like ChatGPT with EU data protection laws.



Noyb, also known as the European Center for Digital Rights, operates out of Vienna, Austria, with a mission to support European General Data Protection Regulation laws through strategic legal actions and media initiatives.



This incident adds to a growing concern surrounding the accuracy and compliance of chatbot technologies. 



In a similar vein, in December 2023, a study revealed issues with Microsoft’s Bing AI chatbot, now called Copilot, providing misleading information during political elections in Germany and Switzerland. 



Additionally, Google’s Gemini AI chatbot faced criticism for generating inaccurate imagery, prompting the company to issue an apology and commit to model updates.

BitFinex Under Threat? Hackers Allege Access to 400K Accounts - DailyCoin


        
FSOCIETY sparked panic by claiming to have compromised BitFinex. 



Initially, security researchers authenticated the hack, citing a match with some leaked passwords.



BitFinex CTO Paolo Ardoino chimed in, casting doubt on the hack. 
Notorious hacking group FSOCIETY, styled after the crew in the hit TV show Mr. Robot, claimed successful hacks on several victims on its dark web homepage, which included crypto exchange BitFinex. Their hacking group claimed to possess terabytes of users’ data from the exchange and threatened to release it, plunging users into panic. Yet, as users scrambled to safeguard their accounts, FSOCIETY’s credibility waned, leaving many questioning if they were just another group crying wolf.BitFinex Hacked?On April 25, FSociety proudly announced on the dark web that it compromised over 400,000 BitFinex accounts, grasping over 2.5 terabytes of user data. The hacking group issued a seven-day ultimatum for the exchange to reach out, backing up their claim by leaking a text file containing a partial dump of usernames and plaintext passwords. 
But it didn’t stop there. FSociety upped the ante by threatening to unleash the KYC details of all users if their demands weren’t met promptly. As the clock ticked down, chaos rippled through BitFinex’s user base. In a frenzy to validate the breach, security researchers tested the leaked passwords, triggering 2FA prompts and sending a wave of urgency for users to change their credentials.Amid the panic, Paolo Ardoino, BitFinex’s CTO and CEO of Tether, chimed in, casting doubt on the legitimacy of the hack.BitFinex CTO Clears the AirAfter a week of panic, Ardoino offered some relief on Friday, clarifying that the data originated from another breach and not from BitFinex. The executive also revealed that the hackers never reached out for ransom.
The BitFinex CTO detailed that FSociety’s data contained 22,500 records of emails and passwords, of which only 5,000 were linked to BitFinex users. Ardonio also emphasized that the exchange didn’t store passwords in plaintext. He also highlighted that if any real information had been compromised, they would have been contacted through their bug bounty program, customer support ticket system, emails, or Twitter.https://x.com/paoloardoino/status/1786751936760312050Shinoji Research linked the emails to the recent CoinMarketCap breach, asserting that the compromised accounts had a significant presence on HaveIBeenPwned, a website that indicates if your email has been compromised.Ardoino maintained that BitFinex found no breaches after a deep analysis of its system. In a separate tweet, he unveiled FSociety’s motives, claiming the ransomware group aimed to promote its ransomware tool and share profits with subscribers.Ardoino questioned, "If they truly hacked BitFinex, do they really need to sell stuff for $299?"On the Flipside
The panic surrounding Bitfinex stems from its notorious hack in 2016. Two individuals pleaded guilty to money laundering charges in connection with the hack, surrendering over 95,000 Bitcoin to the government.



Losses due to crypto hacks dropped by 67% in April to $60.2 million, marking a notable reduction in crypto attacks, representing the first significant decline in 2024.
Why This MattersThe panic surrounding BitFinex’s alleged hack serves as why it is essential to do your research, talk to officials, and stay up to date with official communication from the team to keep yourself safe.Are altcoins under threat?Michael Saylor Warns SEC to Flag ETH, ADA, SOL as SecuritiesBitcoin pulls a surprise comeback:Bitcoin Reclaims $63,000 After Massive Liquidation Scare

Ethereum's $35 million shake-up: How ETH's 7% hike triggered a 2-month high - AMBCrypto



ETH’s price appreciated by over 5% on 3 May
This contributed to a hike in the number of short positions liquidated

Ethereum’s [ETH] 7% price rally during the intraday trading session on 3 May caused short liquidations on its derivatives market to rally to a two-month high, according to Coinglass. 
In fact, the on-chain data provider went on to reveal that on that day, $35 million worth of ETH’s short positions were liquidated. In comparison, long liquidations totalled just $7.16 million. 
Source: Coinglass
Liquidations happen in an asset’s derivatives market when a trader’s position is forcefully closed due to insufficient funds to maintain it. Short liquidations occur when the value of an asset suddenly rises, and traders who have open positions in favor of a price decline are forced to exit their positions. 
According to Santiment’s data, the altcoin closed on 3 May above $3000 after trading below that price level since the beginning of the month.
Derivatives market traders stay their hands
Still extending its gains at press time, ETH’s price was up by over 5% in the last 24 hours. At the time of writing, the market-leading altcoin was valued at $3,104. 
Here, it’s worth noting that Coinglass data also suggested that the price rally has not instigated any significant activity in ETH’s derivatives market. In fact, trading volume in that market grew by just 2%.

Similarly, the coin’s Futures open interest recorded a minor 3% hike over the same period. ETH’s Futures open interest was $10.68 billion at press time. Furthermore, ETH’s Options volume cratered by over 50% during the period under review.
 Options trading grants participants the right to buy or sell an asset at a specified date. Generally, when ETH sees a decline in its Options volume, it means that there is less speculation on its future price movements as market participants wait to see where the coin’s market might be heading next. 
A combined reading of the minor hike in ETH’s Futures trading volume and its declining Options volume suggests that the coin’s derivatives market participants have adopted a “wait and see” approach. Simply put, they are not placing significant bets on where its price might head next.

Shiba Inu and Dogecoin Challenger Crazy Wolf (CRAWOLF) Will Surge 7,000% Within 48 Hours



                    

Crazy Wolf (CRAWOLF) could become a viral memecoin, like Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE).



Crazy Wolf (CRAWOLF), a Solana memecoin that was launched today, is aiming to challenge other memecoin giants, such as Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE).




Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Crazy Wolf presents a similar opportunity.



The exciting memecoin is poised to rally 7,300% in the coming two days, and Crazy Wolf could potentially reach a multi-million dollar market cap within a few weeks.



Currently, Crazy Wolf can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jupiter and Raydium, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days.



To buy Crazy Wolf on these platforms, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Crazy Wolf by entering its contract address – 4cra6VGCDowfFz3HDz5ctXtCSAhQQ5FEscKMLGzB56ML – in the receiving field.



In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price.



If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner.



The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum.




This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like CRAWOLF.

Telegram Becoming Crypto-Based Everything App, What Will Happen to TON?


After months of Elon Musk teasing about turning X into an "everything app" and introducing peer-to-peer crypto payments in 2024, Telegram is now making waves as the first major platform to embrace the Web3 ecosystem.In a recent interview with Tucker Carlson, the founder of Telegram praised Musk for his innovative mindset and efforts to build the SocialFi platform, aiming to empower content creators with fair ad revenue returns.SocialFi represents a fusion of social media and decentralized finance (DeFi), offering users control over their content without reliance on central authority. Creators retain ownership of their content and data, unlike in Web2 platforms. Users can monetize their engagement and following without limitations, opening up new financial opportunities.With Telegram's recent adoption of TON, Tether and other features, the platform has garnered more attention from the crypto community than ever before.Does TON belong to Telegram?The Open Network (TON) was initially developed by Telegram, but a subsequent legal battle with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission saw the messaging application abandon its development efforts in May 2020.The blockchain was originally designed to integrate with Telegram, but its initial attempt was foiled by the United States Securities and Exchange Commission. Telegram was able to reunite with TON after the network was relaunched by independent developers, making it the only major messaging platform to incorporate Web3.In a post dubbed “What Was TON And Why It Is Over,” the Telegram CEO said that they made the decision in response to a U.S. court prohibiting Telegram from distributing its Gram tokens anywhere in the world. Durov wrote:“The US court declared that Grams couldn't be distributed not only in the United States, but globally. Why? Because, it said, a US citizen might find some way of accessing the TON platform after it launched,” Durov complained.Durov decided to part ways with TON, which became an independent community of validators, launched the TON blockchain independently from Telegram on May 7.However, Telegram endorsed TON in September last year, saying the blockchain and the associated token would be its "official Web3 infrastructure.""To limit Telegram’s share of TON at ≈10% of the supply, we’ll be selling the upcoming surplus of our TON holdings to long-term investors — under 1-4 years lockup and vesting plan, but at a discount to the market price. This way free-floating TON will get locked up, stabilizing the ecosystem and reducing volatility," he statedNew Web3 infrastructureIn September 2023, Telegram introduced its long-awaited crypto wallet built on the TON blockchain.The TON Foundation announced that projects operating on the TON blockchain would receive priority access to Telegram's advertising platform, Telegram Ads. While the wallet feature is currently available in settings for existing users, a global rollout is scheduled to commence in November, excluding the United States and select other countries.In February 2024, Telegram revealed a plan to share ad revenue with channel owners and pay rewards using the Toncoin (TON) token. Telegram recently implemented that plan and allowed users to purchase in-platform ads with TON.On March 31, Telegram introduced a reward system that would allow channel owners with substantial subscribers to earn 50% of the revenue from ads shown in their channels in Toncoin (TON), the project’s native cryptocurrency.Durov said that 50% of the revenue Telegram receives from displaying ads and broadcast channels would be shared with channel owners and content creators using TON’s network.To further extend the Web3 infrastructure, Telegram plans to tokenize its stickers and emojis by transforming them into NFTs on the TON blockchain. This announcement was made at the Token2049 event in Dubai, where Durov highlighted the potential of socially relevant NFTs integrated into human culture and communication.Tether joins TelegramIn a big move with potential game-changing repercussions, Tether recently launched its USDT token and Tether Gold (XAUT) on TON, marking a significant expansion to 15 blockchains. The integration with Telegram, boasting over 900 million users, is expected to enable seamless peer-to-peer (P2P) payments within Telegram's user base.By introducing USDT and XAUT on TON, Tether aims to enhance value transfer between users in the TON ecosystem and other blockchain networks, with increased speed and reduced costs. The addition of USD₮ and XAU₮ on TON is expected to enhance liquidity and activity while offering users a financial experience comparable to traditional systems, advancing Tether's mission of open financial infrastructure across blockchain technology.The Open Network claims to “revolutionize” global peer-to-peer payments, allowing Telegram users to send money instantly without needing a blockchain address or downloading a new app.Notably, USDT on TON will be complemented by fully integrated on-ramps supporting most fiat currencies globally. Additionally, integrated global off-ramps will facilitate users’ withdrawal of supported fiat directly to their bank accounts or cards.The TON Foundation has allocated 11 million TON tokens as incentives to drive adoption. Five million TON will be utilized to boost rewards in USDT/TON liquidity pools across TON decentralized exchanges (DEXes) like StonFi and Dedust.Another 5 million TON will be distributed to users who deposit USDT to the Earn campaign of Telegram’s wallet. Furthermore, withdrawals to TON from supporting exchanges such as OKEx, Bybit and KuCoin will be free for all users until the end of June 2024.The TON community lead urged other cryptocurrencies to join:
New investmentFollowing the news of Tether’s involvement in Telegram, Pantera Capital, a multibillion-dollar hedge fund and venture capital firm, announced its investment in the platform.Pantera sees TON as a platform to broaden cryptocurrency adoption, expecting TON's continued growth among Telegram users, highlighting its scalability and cost-effectiveness."We believe TON has the capacity to introduce crypto to the masses because it is used extensively within the Telegram network. Telegram has over 900 million monthly active users on its future-facing, fast, and secure messaging platform that is used for personal and group communications, large-scale community building, content sharing, and more," the company stated. Toncoin priceIn February, Toncoin embarked on a series of initiatives, demonstrating continued positive momentum. The most recent initiative involved distributing 30 million TON for user participation in ecosystem projects.In late March 2024, Toncoin (TON) surged by 31.83% to $3.68, hitting a two-year high, driven by anticipation of Telegram's upcoming IPO. Trading volumes for TON spiked by 301.96%, reaching $269 million.Source: CoinMarketCapThe integration of the TON wallet into Telegram led to a nearly 7% surge in the price of Toncoin upon the announcement. Following the disclosure of the partnership with Tether, the Toncoin price reached $8.02.

Bitcoin will 'propel the next leg up' if key trading pattern confirms - Traders

Bitcoin’s (BTC) price could see a bullish trend reversal and “propel the next leg up” if the popular trading indicator known as the inverse head and shoulders pattern is confirmed, according to a crypto trader."If we don't break straight through $67.5k then something like this forming over the next month would make sense for a bottom pattern reversal,” crypto trader Matthew Hyland explained in a May 4 post on X.He is referring to the inverse head and shoulders pattern — a bullish indicator which signals the downtrend is easing, and buyers are becoming more dominant in the market.“It would be a great setup to propel the next leg up,” he declares.Although it is crucial that Bitcoin holds above its short-term holder price of $59,500 to "maintain its bullish trend," pseudonymous crypto analyst and co-founder of CMCC Crest Willy Woo told his 1.1 million X followers on May 3.If the inverse head and shoulders pattern forms, Bitcoin's price could dip to $60,000 support levels before hitting new all-time highs. Source: Matthew HylandThe setup appears when Bitcoin’s price forms three troughs below a so-called neckline resistance, with the middle trough — otherwise known as the head  — deeper than the left and right shoulder. Bitcoin’s price has slightly rebounded from the “head" at $58,614 on May 1, and if the pattern continues as Hyland’s model suggests, it will find support around its second shoulder, at $60,000 — a key support level.The decline would represent a 5% from its current price of $63,350, as per CoinMarketCap data. Dropping to this level would liquidate $530 million in long positions, according to CoinGlass data.Bitcoin is currently trading at $63,340. Source: CoinMarketCapAccording to Hyland's model, Bitcoin may rise above the neckline and exceed its current all-time high of $73,800 by June.On top of this, buyer interest in the crypto market is slowly increasing, according to the Fear and Greed Index.The index is currently sitting on a "Greed" score of 69, a major recovery from three days ago when it indicated "Fear" with a score of 43.Related: Bitcoin opens $63K futures gap as thin liquidity threatens BTC priceMeanwhile, some traders expect Bitcoin's price to remain stagnant in the near term, but they don't necessarily view this as negative.“The longer the Bitcoin consolidation takes, the higher its price will meet the trendline,” added pseudonymous crypto trader Titan of Crypto.“Bitcoin’s previous cycle all-time highs tend to slow down price and make Bitcoin stall for some weeks,” pseudonymous crypto trader Daan Crypto Traders told his X followers in a May 4 post.Magazine: Meme coins: Betrayal of crypto’s ideals… or its true purpose?This article does not contain investment advice or recommendations.

Bitcoin's bull cycle - Don't be 'fooled' by BTC price's 'April Turmoil' because... - AMBCrypto



Experts like Tom Lee believe Bitcoin will climb higher
Metrics suggested the market hasn’t bottomed yet in light of the persistent sell-side pressure

The last few weeks have been very critical for Bitcoin [BTC], with its price dropping below the critical $60,000-level too. However, following significant corrections, the coin recovered on the charts to trade at $63,167 at the time of writing.
BTC’s 6% hike over a period of just 24 hours points to a potential reversal in the cryptocurrency’s market trajectory. Needless to say, this has renewed a sense of optimism among investors and observers alike.
Is there a buying opportunity amidst volatility?
As volatile as Bitcoin may be right now, however, many execs believe this is an opportunity too. Specially, some see this as a good buying opportunity. Foremost among them is Tom Lee, with Fundstrat’s co-founder claiming during an interview, 
“I think that we’re kind of being fooled by the April turmoil and I think that’s why it’s a buying opportunity for both Bitcoin and stocks now.”
He added, 
“It doesn’t mean it’s going to turn around today but, I don’t think this is a top.” 
According to the exec, the most recent decline was a healthy correction, one possibly driven by profit-taking.
That’s not all, however, with another analyst – @el_crypto_prof – taking to X (Formerly Twitter) to draw a parallel with a historical market trend. 
“History doesn’t repeat itself, but it often rhymes. $BTC has touched a trend line that has played an important role since the beginning of 2023. 
Shedding light on Bitcoin’s future outlook he added, 
“The thing will be sent higher. It’s only a matter of time, imo.” 
Source: El_crypto_prof/Twitter
Crypto-analyst TechDev chipped in too, with the analyst stating,  
“The impulsive structure of the last 1.5 years says 90-100K is next. $BTC”
Source: TechDev/Twitter
Simply put, the general consensus among most analysts is that these market conditions are not the end of the bullish cycle. Rather, they are simply a temporary setback.  
What are the metrics hinting at? 
AMBCrypto’s analysis of BTC’s Age Consumed data echoed its previous findings. Since 3 April, there has been minimal activity, suggesting no indication of a price bottom.
Additionally, Bitcoin’s Network Realized Profit/Loss (NPL) data, which measures the difference between the last moved price and the current market price, also failed to show signs of a price bottom.
Source: Santiment
Ergo, both metrics contradict the sentiments shared by Lee and others, suggesting that the market may not have reached its bottom yet. 
Echoing the same, an analysis by Glassnode highlighted an uptick in Bitcoin outflows in April – A sign of selling pressure in the market.

Why Regulators Should Embrace DeFi - The Daily Hodl


								
 
Stress tests of major banks have repeatedly failed to uncover serious issues that have led to billions of dollars in losses – DeFi (decentralized finance) changes all of this.
Right now, the world’s financial system operates under a veil of secrecy.
Global banks currently undergo stress tests to examine whether they can withstand significant and sudden market downturns.
But in some cases, regulators only require these exercises to take place once every two years – and the outcomes can be unacceptably opaque.
It is only 16 years since Lehman Brothers spectacularly filed for bankruptcy in what was the world’s biggest commercial collapse ever.
Millions of high-risk mortgages had led to an unstable financial system, as well as a deep and punishing recession when the bubble burst.
Some lessons were learned back then. Scrutiny of major banks increased, and more aggressive affordability checks for home loans were imposed.
Yet despite tighter laws, closer oversight and more stringent stress tests, history keeps on repeating itself.
Just last year, yet another crisis unfolded – with the Bank for International Settlements describing it as “the most significant system-wide banking stress” since 2008.
Silicon Valley Bank, Signature and First Republic all suffered high-profile failures, while Credit Suisse endured a humiliating bailout and takeover by rival UBS.
In the space of 11 days, four banks with an astounding $900 billion in assets were shut down – creating a contagion effect and a crisis of confidence among consumers.
The Federal Reserve’s aggressive rate hikes exposed inadequate risk management procedures within these corporations, with losses on government bonds leading to large deposit outflows that dealt a fatal blow to their liquidity.
The fact that all of this could unfold so quickly painfully exposes the flaws that exist within stress tests.
Regulators are only getting a mere glimpse into the financial health of banks that billions of people rely on every day – and when things go wrong, they’re left playing catch up.
To make matters worse, inadequate levels of transparency are coinciding with an increasingly uncertain economic picture.
Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell has once again admitted that inflation in the US is taking longer than expected to cool – and interest rate cuts may not come as soon as hoped.
The heightened cost of borrowing is causing mortgage defaults to tick upwards.
Widespread issues in China’s property market have also cast a dark shadow over the world’s second-largest economy, with effects that could be felt elsewhere.
Meanwhile, the International Monetary Fund has warned ongoing conflicts in Ukraine and the Middle East could jeopardize growth prospects in the coming years.
Put it all together, and one thing becomes clear.
It’s never been more important for regular, in-depth stress tests to expose potential vulnerabilities in the financial system – but current methods are falling well short of what’s required.
DeFi offers a compelling alternative and should be embraced by regulators as a matter of urgency.
Lifting the veil of secrecy
When compared with the smoke and mirrors in the world of CeFi (centralized finance) – which means sizable risks to the health of an economy are only detected when it’s too late – DeFi delivers full transparency and in real-time.
DeFi protocols are self-contained ecosystems governed by smart contracts visible to all.
They’re powered by lines of code that dictate the rules for transactions, eliminating the prospect of human error and greed.
An open-source environment means anyone can access and scrutinize these smart contracts, allowing potential issues to be identified and acted upon quickly.
This is in the interests of all parties concerned – the regulators vying to achieve stability, the businesses that wish to avoid costly and reputation-damaging incidents and the consumers who want cast-iron assurances that their savings are safe.
So, what does this mean in practice? Well, it ensures that protocols can be continuously monitored.
Through online simulations, experts can examine how a platform’s liquidity and health are impacted by a multitude of factors – including changes to interest rates, mass withdrawals or a sudden decline in asset prices.
This delivers instant feedback on potential weak spots, meaning preventative safeguards can be put in place.
Never before have regulators been able to access such a vast wealth of data so quickly – and ascertain the financial fragility or resilience of an entire ecosystem with every passing transaction.
Fostering innovation and competition
All of this goes beyond helping regulators uphold high standards. DeFi also ushers in a new financial era – one of inclusion.
Anyone can participate and innovate in the many protocols that now exist today and see where their entrepreneurial spirit takes them.
Whereas old-fashioned firms have proprietary algorithms and complex structures that create barriers to entry, open protocols foster competition and prevent powerful incumbents from forming.
This already has real-world consequences – with banks quick to hike the cost of borrowing when interest rates rise but slow to reward savers.
In Australia, banks have been accused of ‘profit push’ pricing because there are few rivals in the market.
Over in Belgium, regulators have compared the financial sector to an ‘oligopoly,’ where competition is suppressed by major banks.
And in a recent poll, two-thirds of Irish adults said they believe that there’s a lack of competition within the banking industry, and it’s difficult to switch to other providers.
It’s time for change.
By embracing DeFi’s transparency and open architecture, regulators can gain a more holistic view of the financial landscape.
Real-time monitoring, coupled with a decentralized structure, offers the potential for a more resilient and inclusive financial system.
DeFi’s promise of interoperability – where different protocols seamlessly interact – further fosters innovation and paves the way for a vibrant ecosystem.
The time for opaque financial institutions and inadequate stress tests is over.
DeFi presents an opportunity for a more transparent, secure and dynamic financial future – and many existing protocols are keen to cooperate with regulators.
PwC recently said, “There is no investment without trust” – and achieving compliance can actually add value to a project, as well as encourage adoption.
The potential of DeFi to revolutionize financial systems is undeniable. Its core principle – radical transparency – offers a powerful tool to prevent future financial crises.
By openly recording all transactions on a public ledger, DeFi eliminates the opaque practices that fueled past meltdowns.
Regulators, instead of fearing disruption, should recognize DeFi’s potential as an early warning system, enabling them to identify and address risks before they snowball.

Uniswap founder talks about 8 ethical factors regarding token launch | Cryptopolitan

Ethical issues related to token launches have continued. There have been various tokens that were launched on a speculative basis and have brought nothing but losses to investors. Uniswap founder Hayden Adams has opened up about ethical issues related to the token launch and talked about the different aspects of this matter. Token launch and related issuesThe token launch has been one of the critical issues in the blockchain ecosystem. If the developers are clear and fair about the token, it can gain traction in a matter of less time. But if they deceive the investors through fake claims, it can result in a loss of trust in crypto. It has happened multiple times, affecting the trust of customers in the market. Hayden Adams is one of those leaders in the market who continue to ask for fair play in order to improve trust in the crypto market. He has been active in the market since the launch of Uniswap as its founder. He developed Uniswap as a decentralized app on Ethereum, making it one of the most used in the dApp world.  Uniswap is a decentralized crypto exchange that has a set of smart contracts that can be used for crypto trades. In contrast to centralized exchanges, it has certain smart contracts that facilitate crypto trades. Those who invest their crypto assets in this exchange and agree to not trade or sell them can earn UNI tokens. Hayden built one of the most robust protocols for cryptocurrency exchange and developed its token into a valuable one. Now, he has opened up about being heedful to certain issues related to token launches that can affect trust in the crypto market.  Hayden Adams’ (Uniswap founder) take on token launchUniswap founder Hayden Adams has been clear about the token launch. He shared his own perspective regarding them in a detailed Tweet where he covered eight different ethical issues regarding the launch of tokens. He clarified it in the tweet that it wasn’t aimed at any specific project or a developer but rather advice for all. He added that he had seen a growing discourse regarding this issue so he wanted to add his view to it. The first thing he talked about is that the developers should focus on tokens not points. He took a negative view of teasing the investors by creating ambiguity regarding the token distribution. Many developers don’t share the details and keep them delaying in order to grow numbers. He also said that there should be no speculation about a token if there is no clarity about it. He said that if the team doesn’t know what comes next for the token, they shouldn’t be speculating publicly about its value. The Uniswap founder believes in sharing details when ready and has the same advice for developers. Furthermore, he said that he didn’t like float tokens which are malicious. He added further, that developers don’t need exchanges and market makers for effective distribution of tokens. He also said that the developers shouldn’t make an absurdly high token supply which creates unit bias. He also advised against stinginess which will create problems. Further insights regarding tokensHe added that the token price shouldn’t be marketed. If influencers and celebrities are involved in the marketing of tokens, then it means that the developers aren’t building real value. He advised against it and said that they should focus on building real value for tokens. In his final advice, he said that market leaders should be careful about their decisions. He said that decisions shouldn’t be haphazard, making them laughing stock for crypto Twitter. ConclusionUniswap founder Hayden Adams talked about the problems related to token launch in a Tweet. He covered a range of issues in eight points. The narrative talked about building value instead of fanfare so that tokens launches don’t make market leaders a laughing stock.

WIF can flip PEPE in the memecoin race, but ONLY if... - AMBCrypto



WIF recorded a massive surge in market cap over the last few days, while also inching closer to PEPE
Social volume and sentiment around WIF fell, despite the hike in price

Dogwifhat [WIF] has been one of the market’s most popular memecoins over the last few months. While once the memecoin saw its fair share of ups and downs, it would seem that the altcoin is now well on its way to break into the memecoin sector’s top-3
A WIF of success
Over the last few days, the marketcap of WIF has surged significantly. Owing to the same, WIF is now exceedingly close to overtaking PEPE’s marketcap and rank.
Source: CoinMarketCap
However, for WIF to surpass PEPE and claim the number 3 position, the price of WIF would need to climb significantly higher. Also, while WIF did climb by a significant 25% in just 24 hours, it wasn’t able to reverse its prevailing market trend. In fact, until the most recent bout of price appreciation, the memecoin was on its way down, hitting multiple lower lows and lower highs on the charts.
For WIF to break past this bearish trend and possibly push itself to the $4.382-level, it would have to test and move past the $3.594-level.
Worth noting, however, that the CMF (Chaikin Money Flow) for WIF was on its side and had risen significantly – A sign of rising money flow and buying pressure.
However, the RSI had a reading of 74.86, indicating that the price may be in the overbought zone despite all the bullish momentum. Ergo, WIF may see a correction in the next few days before rising higher again.
Source: Trading View
Looking at the socials
A huge majority of WIF’s price surge can be attributed to the social volume around the WIF token. However, over the last few days, the social volume around WIF declined, which may cause massive problems for WIF’s price in the future.
Additionally, the weighted sentiment around WIF fell too, suggesting that the number of negative comments around WIF grew.

On the flipside, social volume around PEPE continued to remain consistent, while its weighted sentiment grew. The positive outlook around PEPE on social media platforms may give PEPE the right amount of edge needed to retain its number 3 position in the memecoin sector. Especially since alongside WIF, PEPE also hiked by double-digits on the charts.

New Lawsuit Filed Against Coinbase: Affecting Solana and 7 Other Altcoins - Bitcoin Sistemi

Coinbase, the leading cryptocurrency exchange by trading volume in the United States, is once again under the legal spotlight. A new class-action lawsuit has been filed against the company, claiming that its entire business model has been unlawful from its inception. This case mirrors a similar lawsuit the company is currently facing.
Plaintiffs in the new lawsuit claim that the ALGO, XLM, SOL, MANA, MATIC, NEAR, UNI and XTZ tokens traded on Coinbase are, in fact, securities. The lawsuit was filed in the Northern District of California by west coast law firm Scott+Scott, which represents plaintiffs from California and Florida.


The lawsuit alleges that Coinbase has “knowingly, willfully, and repeatedly violated state securities laws since it began doing business.” In response to these allegations, Coinbase issued a statement denying the allegations as “legally unfounded,” expressing full faith in due process, and stating their intent to fully address the allegations at the appropriate time.

Interestingly, this case bears a striking resemblance to another case currently pending in the courts. This other lawsuit also alleges consumer damages resulting from the sale of securities on Coinbase's platform. The case, which was initially dismissed in February 2023, was partially revived following a recent decision by the 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals.





This latest case differs from Coinbase's highly publicized legal battle with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) on a similar issue, namely whether tokens sold on Coinbase are securities. In this ongoing case, Coinbase recently filed a temporary appeal challenging a judge's decision to allow the case to proceed.

                        Today’s Ripple price prediction is closely watched as XRP trades at $0.5283 with a 24-hour trading volume of $675 million. Despite a slight decline of 0.40%, Ripple maintains its position as the seventh-ranked cryptocurrency on CoinMarketCap, with a market capitalization of approximately $29.18 billion. The currency has a circulating supply of 55.24 billion XRP coins out of a maximum supply of 100 billion, highlighting its significant stake in the cryptocurrency market.860,000 Investors Flock to XRP Despite Price Drop
Over the past month, the number of XRP investors holding between 1,000 and 1,000,000 tokens has increased to 860,000, a rise of 0.23%, according to data from Santiment. This uptick in holders comes in spite of a decrease in XRP’s market value.Notably, this group of investors, often referred to as “whales,” experienced a decline early in the year, with numbers dropping from 867,000 to a low of 858,000 by April 3. However, the count rebounded shortly thereafter.This slight yet significant growth in investor numbers is remarkable given the broader context of a 7% loss in XRP’s value recently. Such an increase in whale activity typically suggests a potential price rally could be on the horizon.Despite the prevailing bearish market conditions, the resilience of the demand for XRP highlights its ongoing appeal among substantial stakeholders.
XRP whale count hints at a possible price rally.
Despite a 7% drop in value, investor interest in XRP remains high.
Key momentum indicators like the Chaikin Money Flow (CMF) show positive signs despite the price decline.
Ripple Price Prediction
The four-hour chart demonstrates that XRP/USD is currently teetering near its pivot point of $0.5180. Should XRP manage to sustain its position above this level, the outlook could remain bullish.Conversely, a drop below this threshold may precipitate a sharp downward trend. This pivot point acts as a critical juncture for determining XRP’s short-term price movements.On the technical front, key resistance levels are established at $0.5555, $0.5957, and $0.6280, which Ripple would need to breach to confirm further bullish momentum. Support levels are identified at $0.4877, $0.4586, and $0.4361, which will provide cushions if the price falls.The presence of a symmetrical triangle pattern on the chart suggests that XRP is consolidating within these bounds. Depending on market forces and trader sentiment, a breakout or breakdown may occur.Ripple Price Prediction – Source: TradingviewThe Relative Strength Index (RSI) is at 54, indicating neither overbought nor oversold conditions. The 50-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA) is positioned at $0.5207, closely aligning with the current pivot and reinforcing its role as a significant support level.Conclusion: Ripple’s performance is currently balanced with a cautious outlook; remaining above $0.5180 could foster a bullish scenario while dropping this pivot below might lead to significant selling pressure.Dogeverse Raised Over $13 Million; Secure Now

Paolo Ardoino (Bitfinex CTO) has denied rumors of data breach | Cryptopolitan

There have been claims about a hacker group breaching the personal data of users from Bitfinex. The company has denied any such claims saying that the customer data is safe. They are carrying out investigations to ensure that no such event has taken place. Claims regarding rumors of Bitfinex data breachBitfinex is a cryptocurrency exchange that is registered in the British Virgin Islands. It was founded in 2012 and has continued to be one of the biggest names of trust in the crypto market. Initially, it was designed to be a Bitcoin P2P exchange but was later modified to accommodate other cryptocurrencies.It faced a big data heist in 2016 when BTC worth more than $71 million was heisted in a matter of hours. This breach is considered one of the biggest heists in crypto history. Serious flaws in the Bitfinex security protocol were pointed out which were later remedied. Though the thief hasn’t been found, there have been individual developments where the stolen Bitcoins were recovered. iFinex, the owner company of Bitfinex, commissioned a report to find out the reasons for the heist. The commission found a number of reasons for this happening. There was a recommendation for some operational, financial, and technological controls to ensure that no such event takes place again.Since then, Bitfinex has continued to be safe for users as no such event has been reported again. But recently some hackers posted mega links about the data breach of Bitfinex. According to hackers, it contained the personal data of the users.  Paolo Ardoino’s response Bifinex’s CTO responded to the claims regarding the data breach saying that it was nothing but rumors. He said that everyone was panicking about the possibility of the data breach but it seemed fake for a number of reasons. He mentioned that the hackers have posted mega links that contain a sample of passwords and emails. He refuted the claim that they don’t store passwords in plaintext. In addition to that, nor are 2FA stored in clear text. Furthermore, the 22.5 emails contain only 5K of the Bitfinex users. He added further that if the emails were from their database, they would have matched 100%. In contrast, it is the opposite and makes sure that no data breach has taken place. Also, the hackers had posted about the data breach on 25 April 2024 but no one contacted the Bitfinex team regarding ransom. Paolo is of the view that if they had data they would have asked for ransom in the possible options available.He also chided data security experts for hyping the matter without getting enough information. He said that these emails are possibly from different crypto breaches that the hackers have collected to get hype for their claims. No need to panicPaolo Ardoino added consoling words for the customers saying that they don’t need to panic and no such breach has taken place. He said that they had analyzed their system and no such evidence regarding the breach was found. Furthermore, they were performing a deep analysis which will confirm whether any data has been lost to hackers. He assured the users that it was a FUD and they would ensure that no stone remained unturned to ensure the security of the platform. ConclusionBitfinex CTO has refuted the claims of a possible data breach. He assured the users that no such event had taken place and there was no proof regarding the data breach. His arguments were solid and he assured that they will continue investigations about the matter.

Horoscope crypto from May 6th to May 12th

New week, new crypto horoscope dedicated to the upcoming week from May 6th to May 12th.
This week will be characterized by the transit of the New Moon in Taurus on Wednesday 8/5.
For several months now we have been dedicating space to the crypto horoscope written by Stefania Stimolo, an expert in astrology and blockchain. It is a weekly column with the horoscope of each zodiac sign available every Sunday only on The Cryptonomist. 
In our slogan “Telling the Future”, we wanted to delve deeper into the topic, jokingly speaking, with this entertainment column. 

The crypto horoscope
We call it crypto horoscope simply because industry terminology is used. 
Words like NFT, metaverse, and Over-The-Counter to describe actions and scenarios, but also trading terminology like bullish, bull run, bear market, or dump to identify the mood of each zodiac sign during the days of the week.
Obviously, the famous to-the-moon cannot be missing to indicate the mood of that sign! 
In general, you could experience a period of “hard-fork”, intended as an “inner split”, or pass your lightning torch to the next zodiac sign, meaning that the Sun is moving into the next sign. 
Or, simply, you need to reflect on some situations that go into “verify“, that is when the planet is in dissonance with the zodiac sign. Moreover, with each new change of guard of the Sun through the constellations of the zodiac, the roadmap of each sign will touch a new step. 
Obviously no investment advice is given, in fact, it is pure entertainment, just like any other horoscope. It must be said that there are many beginners in the sector who have understood the specific crypto terminology also thanks to the horoscope on The Cryptonomist. 
“Don’t Trust, Verify”
Astrology is not an exact science, but it aims to predict the future in its own way. So why not associate the typical phrase of blockchain “Don’t Trust, Verify” here as well. 
And in fact, what the author wants to propose is her interpretation of the planetary transits that occur during the week, describing the reaction of each zodiac sign, following the “logic” of traditional astrology. 
For those who are astrology lovers, they could stay updated just on the transits that are communicated weekly and somehow influence us. A Mercury Retrograde, or the days of the Full Moon. 
Others, on the other hand, could access the dedicated page, which is updated every Sunday, and read the horoscope of their zodiac sign, their rising sign, or why not, even the horoscope of friends and loved ones. 
And so, just for entertainment purposes, don’t waste time and click here to read your horoscope for this week!

Bitfinex database breach 'seems fake,' says CTO

The claims by hacking group FSOCIETY that they hacked cryptocurrency exchange Bitfinex's database and leaked 22,500 customer emails and passwords “seems fake,” according to Bitfinex chief technology officer Paolo Ardoino.“If they had any real information they would have asked a ramson through our bug bounty, customer support ticket, emails, Twitter, etc. We couldn't find any request,” Ardoino claimed in a May 4 post on X.“We don't store plaintext passwords, nor 2FA secrets in clear text,” he added.Adoino clarified that out of the 22,500 records of emails and passwords, only 5,000 matched with Bitfinex users. He suggested that it is more likely the hackers gathered data from various other crypto data breaches.“Most users unfortunately use the same email and passwords across multiple sites,” he explained.He also shared a message from a security researcher, who believes the hackers were claiming to have hacked Bitfinex as a way to promote a data retrieval hacking tool.“So by creating a buzz about successfully hacking wellknown companies / a university, it is an advertisement of how good their tool is and others should buy it so they can make millions of dollars by using it to exploit companies using this tool.”Ardoino assured users that they would keep investigating the situation, but no breach has been detected so far, and all "funds are safe."Related: Bitcoin post-halving price consolidation could last 2 months — BitfinexThis is not the first time Bitfinex has faced scrutiny over data breach concerns.In November 2023, Cointelegraph reported a minor information security incident at Bitfinex when one of its customer support agents was hacked.This resulted in a series of phishing attacks targeting Bitfinex users, though Bitfinex stated that little harm occurred.Meanwhile, in 2016, Bitfinex suffered a security breach resulting in the loss of 119,576 customers' Bitcoin (BTC), worth around $70 million at the time, and $7.6 billion now.Magazine: Meme coins: Betrayal of crypto’s ideals… or its true purpose?

PEPE 7-day price prediction - 3 key factors will help the memecoin - AMBCrypto



Rising active addresses propelled the significant price increase.
Circulation fell, and many old coins remained stagnant, indicating another upside.

The price of Pepe [PEPE] increased by 15.75% in the last 24 hours before falling 2%, according to data from CoinMarketCap.
Though other memecoins also jumped, AMBCrypto found specific reasons why the hike was special for PEPE.
Price is tied up with activity
According to on-chain data from Santiment, PEPE’s 24-hour active addresses increased from 2669 on the 1st of May to 4470 at press time.
Active addresses show the number of distinct users transacting on the network. In the broader crypto market, this metric does not always correlate with price.
However, a look at PEPE’s situation showed the price has a strong correlation with network activity.
Source: Santiment
Should the metric continue to rise, the price of PEPE might also follow. On the contrary, a decline in active addresses might slow down the memecoin’s upward movement.
As a result of the price increase, Social Dominance jumped. Social Dominance shows the rate of discussions about a project when compared to others in the top 100.
Therefore, the increase implied that the market gave the memecoin the attention that others did not get. However, an extremely high social dominance might not be great for price as shown in the chart below.
A rise to $0.00001 may be next
For instance, when Social Dominance hit 2.21% on the 4th of March, the token reversed from its upswing.  A similar situation occurred on the 1st of April, as the metric indicated that PEPE was overhead.
Furthermore, Social Dominance was at a relatively healthy level. As such, the price of the token might hit $0.00001 before any retracement appears.
As for Social Volume, AMBCrypto noticed that it was not near previous peaks, indicating that the search for PEPE was not intense.
Following historical data, this means that there might be a buying opportunity available before it reaches the local top.
Source: Santiment
In the meantime, the one-day circulation fell from 11.50 trillion to 3.97 trillion. Regarding its price, the decline in circulation might help PEPE sustain the northward move.
This is because less circulation gives room for less selling pressure. However, this would only be the case if the buying momentum increases.
Another metric we evaluated was the dormant circulation. At press time, the 90-day dormant circulation decreased to 59.54 billion.
Source: Santiment

Realistic or not, here’s PEPE’s market cap in DOGE terms

This decrease meant that old holders of the token refrained from moving their assets. Hence, most are unwilling to sell. Should this be the case going forward, another PEPE rally could be close.
This time, the token could drive toward a new high.

XRP Plunges Ahead Of The SEC’s Upcoming Reply Brief On May 6 - Coin Edition


							

XRP pulled back on Saturday as users anticipate the SEC’s reply brief on May 6.
The brief will follow up on the ongoing case between the SEC and Ripple.
The brief’s content will inform users of the strength of the SEC’s case against Ripple.




XRP made a slight pullback on Saturday as users look forward to the upcoming reply brief by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) in its case against Ripple. The court expects the commission to file a remedy-related reply brief on Monday, May 6, to argue why Ripple should be penalized.



The expected reply brief will be one in a series of filings between the SEC and Ripple, which started with the SEC’s opening brief in March. The commission had pressed for a punitive penalty and an injunction against Ripple, alleging that the latter breached U.S. Securities laws after the December 2020 complaint.



Following the SEC’s remedy-related opening brief, Ripple filed a remedy-related opposition brief to counter the SEC’s allegations. In its opposition brief filing, the fintech firm asked the court to strike the SEC’s filing, citing irregularities and lateness in the brief filing. Ripple also noted that it made the post-complain XRP sales to accredited investors through ODL agreements. Hence, it did not constitute an infraction.



Meanwhile, crypto investors, especially members of the Ripple community, look forward to the SEC’s upcoming reply brief on May 6. It will provide information on the strength of the SEC’s case for a punitive penalty and injunction on Ripple. XRP could come under selling pressure peradventure the SEC provides substantive for its claim that XRP breached the law after the December 2020 complaint.



An injunction prohibiting Ripple from selling XRP to institutional investors would significantly affect Ripple’s plans for the U.S. market. It will also impact investors’ sentiment and induce a selling pressure on the altcoin.



XRP traded for $0.52661 at the time of writing, reflecting a 2.78% drop from its Saturday high, according to data from TradingView.

Bitcoin Maintains $63K, Dogecoin's Rise Continues With Another 6% Surge (Weekend Watch)


																Bitcoin’s price recovery tour took it to a multi-day peak of $64,500 yesterday, but the asset failed to continue upward and has retraced by over a grand since then.
Most larger-cal alts are slightly in the red on a daily scale, with TON, ADA, and SHIB declining by 2-4%.
BTC Stopped at $64.5K
The start of May was quite painful for the bitcoin bulls as the cryptocurrency slumped hard after failing to pump above $65,000 a day earlier. The massive correction drove the asset to its lowest price tag in over two months of $56,500.
The Fed’s refusal to raise the interest rates any further brought more volatility, as BTC pumped and dumped by $2,000 in minutes on Wednesday afternoon. Only then started the gradual price recovery as bitcoin jumped to $59,000 by Friday.
The bulls initiated another leg up then that drove the asset to and beyond $62,000. This increase culminated yesterday with an increase to a multi-day high of $64,500.


Thanks for subscribing, you will get your first report in the next hours!


However, bitcoin failed to overcome that level and has retraced by more than $1,000 since then. Still, it trades above $63,000 and its dominance over the alts has neared 51%. In contrast, its market cap has declined to $1.244 trillion on CG.

Bitfinex CTO Dispels FUD, Refutes Data Breach By Ransomware Group | Bitcoinist.com


								In an interesting turn of events, Bitfinex chief technology officer (CTO) Paolo Ardoino has dismissed rumors of the exchange being involved in a large-scale data breach. This came in response to claims of a significant security breach by the hacking group FSOCIETY a little over a week ago.
On April 26, FSOCIETY claimed on its dark web homepage that it had successfully breached the security measures and obtained sensitive data of several entities, including Bitfinex. Other organizations the group contacted include Rutgers University, SBCGlobal, and Coinmoma (likely a wrong spelling of the Coinmama crypto exchange).
FSOCIETY, in its messages to the supposed victims, gave an ultimatum of seven days for each organization to make a substantial payment to avoid the leak of sensitive data. Despite the one-week deadline elapsing, none of these establishments have confirmed a server breach or the payment of a ransom.
Bitfinex CTO Responds To Data Breach Rumors
On Saturday, May 4th, Bitfinex CTO Paolo Ardoino took to the X platform to share a message on a purported breach of the exchange’s servers and security. According to the CTO, the ransomware group never directly contacted the exchange about any data breach, as they only got to find out about the claim on Friday, May 3rd.



Ardoino, who is also the CEO of Tether, mentioned that only 5,000 of the supposedly stolen 22,500 emails match that of Bitfinex customers. The exchange executive claims that hackers merely collected a database of emails/passwords from various crypto hacks.
Ardoino added in his post:
Most of users unfortunately use same email/passwords across multiple sites. We’re performing deep analysis of our systems and no breach was found currently. Also the KYC platform has heavy rate limiting that would disallow downloading in bulk.
While labeling the data breach rumors as pure FUD (fear, uncertainty, and doubt), the Bitfinex CTO reiterated that they will keep evaluating the situation to ensure that “no stone remains unturned.” Ardoino also assured the exchange users that all funds are safe.
Data Breach Claim Was A Marketing Strategy: Security Researcher
In a follow-up post on X, Paolo Ardoino revealed a message from an independent security researcher on the purported data breach incident. According to the unnamed investigator, the FSOCIETY’s claim of the data breach was a ruse to market their ransomware products.

Source: Paolo Ardoino/X
The researcher’s message read:
I believe I start to understand what is happening and why they are sending these messages claiming you were hacked. The message in the screenshot in the ticket came from a TG channel (not reporting here to avoid helping them with free advertisement). There it seems they are selling the tool used that supposedly was used to hack Bitfinex and Rutgers.

With this revelation, Ardoino questioned the credibility of their claims of hacking different organizations. “If they truly hacked Bitfinex, do they really need selling stuff for 299$?,” the CTO said.

Uniswap Founder Shares His Two Cents On Good Token Distributions


                            Hayden Adams, founder of the Uniswap protocol, has shared his opinion on what characterizes a good distribution or rollout of a token. In a recent post on the X platform, the prominent crypto figure listed 10 qualities of good token distributions, highlighting the complexities surrounding the launch of a cryptocurrency.
Uniswap Founder Gives Opinion On Good Token Distributions
Adams began his take on good token distributions by stating that projects should allocate “tokens, not points” to the community. This phrase implies that participants should receive actual tokens that hold value within a particular ecosystem or on a network, instead of receiving points that may have limited utility.


Secondly, Adams warned against creating ambiguity or being vague about a token distribution to increase the number of participants or to “farm the farmers.” A good token distribution practice includes sharing real details when ready, according to the Uniswap founder.

Additionally, Adams criticized “low float tokens,” while calling them malicious. The prominent DeFi figure urged project teams to ensure sufficient tokens are available in circulation to prevent manipulation and allow genuine price discovery.
Adams also discouraged hyping a token’s price and how it will skyrocket before it launches. The founder believes hiring an influencer or a marketing company to promote a token’s value only depicts a get-rich-quick scheme rather than a genuine attempt at building real value.
What’s more, the Uniswap founder stressed the importance of free token airdrops during token distributions. “Don’t be stingy – give a significant amount away. If you don’t think the community deserves a significant amount, don’t release a token,” Adams said in his post.
Ultimately, Adams advised new crypto projects to be careful and thoughtful in their decision-making to avoid making mistakes that might put them at odds with the crypto community. “Create something you’re proud of and stand behind it,” the Uniswap founder added.
A Jab At Friend.tech and its FRIEND?
At the beginning of his post, the Uniswap founder clearly stated that the opinion is not aimed at any specific project. However, the timing is interesting, especially after social media platform Friend.tech’s “unsuccessful” token airdrop.

On Friday, May 3rd, Friend.tech airdropped its new FRIEND tokens to users in conjunction with the launch of the protocol’s version 2. While the token’s value quickly rose to $167 after launch, FRIEND’s price nosedived to below $2 within a few hours.
Analysts pinpointed liquidity issues and a mass sell-off as the primary reasons behind the downturn of FRIEND and, ultimately, the ineffectual token launch. Moreover, many users complained about how challenging it was to claim the token airdrop, as technical drawbacks reportedly frustrated the process.

Sui Network clears up misunderstandings on token supply

Sui Network, a layer-1 decentralized platform, has responded to and corrected common misunderstandings about its token supply. This statement, posted on the X platform, refutes criticisms about its tokenomics, specifically addressing concerns about token distribution and founder control. The platform maintains that its token economics are sound, utilizing reputable third-party custodians to manage locked tokens. Tokens are released according to a predetermined emission schedule and are publicly accessible. The foundation emphasizes that founders cannot control the treasury or tokens allocated to investors, including the community reserve.According to feedback from the Sui Network, the Sui Foundation manages the primary wallet holding locked tokens, which are released under specific conditions to enhance the ecosystem. These allocations support various projects, including Move programming language development, network security enhancements, hackathons, and developer grants.Source: Justin BonsSui Network further explained the distribution of staking rewards circulating in the system. These rewards comprise stake derivatives and network commissions, all of which are returned to the community. This approach is a key aspect of Sui’s economic model, which aims to maintain balance and fairness.Despite Sui Network’s clarifications, Justin Bons from Cyber Capital expressed concerns about the founding team’s token holdings. Bons suggested that the founders may control a substantial portion of staked tokens, posing a centralization risk. This prompted calls for greater transparency and accountability from the network’s management, which the Sui team has since addressed.In contrast, Sui Network disputes this assertion as inaccurate regarding token distribution and management, emphasizing their commitment to transparency. They have disclosed that all tokens, whether distributed or not, are managed in compliance with legal and regulatory standards overseen by reputable custodial services like BitGo, Anchorage, and Coinbase Prime.Related: Can blockchain revolutionize digital securities management for stock exchanges?However, Bons challenged the Sui Network’s claim of transparency by urging them to accurately represent the status of the allocated stake and demonstrate that the founders cannot move or access it. Bons emphasized that his critique is motivated by a desire for SUI’s success. He suggested that misrepresenting these tokens’ status undermines transparency claims and that true transparency requires clear evidence that the allocated tokens are securely held and cannot be manipulated. In September 2023, Sui Network streamlined Web3 logins for users on its apps with Zero Knowledge login (zkLogin), enabling login via Google, Facebook, and Twitch details. Known for high transaction capacity with low fees since launch. Since its launch, it has built a reputation for handling high transaction volumes while maintaining low fees.Magazine: Memecoins make millionaires, Terraform and Do Kwon liable for fraud, and more: Hodler’s Digest, March 31 – April 6

Crypto Analyst Unveils Massive Bitcoin Price Target, Says BTC Flashing Bullish Chart Pattern - Here’s His Outlook - The Daily Hodl


								A widely followed crypto strategist believes that Bitcoin (BTC) can skyrocket over 337% based on a classical chart pattern.
Pseudonymous analyst Cheds tells his 330,400 followers on the social media platform X that Bitcoin appears to be forming a cup-and-handle pattern on the weekly chart.










Cheds says that based on classical charting rules, Bitcoin could soar close to $300,000 in about two years.
“BTC visual of a bull thesis. Measured move for a weekly cup and handle would be roughly $280,000 BTC, likely sometime in mid-2026.”
Source: Cheds/X
The trader highlights that his price target and timeline go against the two widely held views on Bitcoin’s market cycles. One is that the Bitcoin bull market will likely end in 2025 based on the four-year cycle and the other one involves a theory that BTC is witnessing diminishing returns each cycle.
But in the meantime, Cheds implies that Bitcoin may have already seen the bottom of its latest correction after reclaiming $61,500.
“BTC decent volume cluster building on the four-hour chart… flip $61,500 and it gets interesting.”
Source: Cheds/X
Looking at the trader’s chart, he seems to suggest that Bitcoin looks bullish following a fakeout to the downside. The chart also shows a diagonal resistance at around $63,500.
At time of writing, Bitcoin is trading for $63,438, a fractional increase in the past day.

Bitfinex CTO Debunks Data Breach Rumors On The Crypto Exchange - Coin Edition


							

Bitfinex’s CTO has debunked rumors of a suspected data breach on the crypto exchange’s platform.
Ardoino highlighted irregularities contained in the claim by the acclaimed hackers.
According to Ardoino, only 5,000 of 22,500 broadcasted emails matched with Bitfinex users.




Bitfinex CTO Paolo Ardoino has debunked rumors of a suspected data breach on the crypto exchange’s platform. In a recent post on X, Ardoino explained that information broadcasted by the acclaimed hackers is fake, and not derived from the crypto firm’s database.







After acknowledging the widespread panic among crypto users on the rumored database breach, Ardoino highlighted irregularities contained in the claim by the acclaimed hackers. According to the CTO, the alleged hackers have posted two mega links with sample data containing 22,500 records of email and passwords.



To substantiate his claims, Ardoino noted that Bitfinex does not store plaintext passwords nor 2FA secrets in clear text. Hence, no one can access such details from the platform. He further explained that only 5,000 of 22,500 broadcasted emails matched with Bitfinex users, insisting that only a 100% match rate can prove the broadcasted information was from Bitfinex. 



Meanwhile, Ardoino informed his followers on X that the alleged hackers did not contact Bitfinex. According to him, the hackers published the post on April 25, giving the firm a 7-day ultimatum to contact them. Yet, Ardoino noted that he and his team learned about the post on Friday, May 3.



Furthering his claims, Ardoino said the alleged hackers could have explored any available channels to demand a ransom. According to the CTO, they could have applied through Bitfinex’s bug bounty, customer support ticket, emails, or X account (Twitter).



According to Ardoino, initial investigations reveal the hackers collected a database of emails and passwords likely from different crypto breaches. He noted that most crypto users, unfortunately, use the same email and passwords across multiple sites. He assured users that Bitfinex is performing a deep analysis of its systems and hasn’t found any breach. The CTO also noted that his platform’s KYC has a heavy rate limit that would disallow downloading in bulk.

Oil King (OILKING) to Rally 8,300% After Solana Launch, Looks to Challenge Shiba Inu and Dogecoin



                    

Oil King (OILKING) could become a viral memecoin, like Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE).



Oil King (OILKING), a Solana memecoin that was launched today, is aiming to challenge other memecoin giants, such as Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE).




Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Oil King presents a similar opportunity.



Oil King has market cap below $25,000 at the moment, meaning that when it just reaches a modest market cap of $200,000-$500,000, early investors would generate massive returns in a matter of days or hours.



The exciting memecoin is poised to rally 8,300% in the coming two days, and Oil King could potentially reach a multi-million dollar market cap within a few weeks.




Currently, Oil King can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jupiter and Raydium, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days.



To buy Oil King on these platforms, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Oil King by entering its contract address – H5LmDBec75DmGLwtALURVAtLuVDUX1GMh5CGQ8r5h5rU – in the receiving field.



In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price.



If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner.




The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum.



This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like OILKING.

Warren Buffett Warns About AI


Legendary investor Warren Buffett has issued a major warning about artificial intelligence, comparing the red-hot technology to nuclear weapons during a recent shareholder meeting, Axios reports.Buffett's concerns center around the rapid proliferation of AI-powered scams. The American financier has stated that the technology "scares the hell out of him."According to the "Oracle of Omaha," AI has developed to the point where it is hardly possible to decipher what's real and what's actually fake.Buffett, one of the richest people, jokingly described scamming as "the growth industry" of all time.At the same time, he has also acknowledged that his knowledge about AI is limited.The billionaire himself has already fallen victim to scammers. Buffett has recalled how someone used the AI technology to create a convincing deepfake video of him in order to part someone with their money.Of course, Buffett is far from being the only businessman whose identity has been exploited by nefarious actors. As reported by U.Today, Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse has also repeatedly complained about AI fraudsters using his identity in order to promote XRP scams.Of course, plenty of prominent executives have also recognized the promise of AI technologies, with JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon recently comparing it to the steam engine.

Coinbase faces new lawsuit over alleged investor deception

Coinbase, the largest cryptocurrency exchange in the United States by volume and its CEO, Brian Armstrong, is facing a new class-action lawsuit alleging investor deception into buying securities. The lawsuit is from customers who say the company’s business model was illegal. This lawsuit echoes one already faced by the company. The lawsuit, filed in California’s Northern District by law firm Scott+Scott, representing plaintiffs Gerardo Aceves, Thomas Fan, Edwin Martinez, Tiffany Smoot, Edouard Cordi, and Brett Maggard from California and Florida, alleges that Coinbase’s digital asset sales knowingly violated state securities laws since the company’s inception.In the filing, the plaintiffs asserted that Solana (SOL), Polygon (MATIC), Near Protocol (NEAR), Decentraland (MANA), Algorand (ALGO), Uniswap (UNI), Tezos (XTZ), and Stellar Lumens (XLM) are securities.Class action suit by the plaintiff   Source: Court ListenerThe complainants claim Coinbase admitted it is a “Securities Broker” in its user agreement, making digital asset securities sold by the exchange as investment contracts or other securities. The plaintiff also took aim at Coinbase prime brokerage as a securities broker/dealer.The plaintiffs seek full rescission, statutory damages under state law, and injunctive relief through a jury trial. This lawsuit resembles another class-action suit alleging consumer harm from Coinbase’s sale of securities. However, Coinbase argued that secondary crypto asset sales didn’t meet securities transaction criteria, disputing the relevance of securities regulations. The court examined various aspects, ultimately overturning some of the lower court’s decisions while upholding others.Related: Coinbase's Base could make it the NVIDIA of DeFiThis new lawsuit is distinct from Coinbase’s highly publicized legal battle with the SEC, which also questions whether tokens sold on Coinbase should be classified as securities. Coinbase has recently filed an interlocutory appeal in response to a judge’s decision allowing the case to proceed.In an April 26 filing in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York, John Deaton, the crypto lawyer currently running a Senate campaign to unseat Elizabeth Warren, filed an amicus brief in support of a motion for interlocutory appeal on behalf of 4,701 Coinbase customers. Coinbase reported a strong rebound in the first quarter of 2024, supported by an uptick in market performance and the launch of Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs). The exchange posted $1.6 billion in total revenue and $1.2 billion in net income for the first quarter, achieving $1 billion in Adjusted EBITDA — which measures a company’s earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization.

Six to Twelve Months of ‘Parabolic Advance’ on the Horizon for Bitcoin, According to On-Chain Analyst - The Daily Hodl


								Prominent on-chain analyst Checkmate is updating his outlook on Bitcoin’s (BTC) current market cycle and says that a parabolic move to the upside is likely in sight.
The pseudonymous analyst tells his 90,000 followers on the social media platform X that based on previous cycles, Bitcoin is most likely in for about six months of “chopsolidation” – or a choppy period of consolidation with no real trend shift.










After six months, Checkmate says that six months to a year’s worth of parabolic moves could be in store, based on historical precedence.
“Bitcoin history tends to rhyme, and thus far, this cycle is no different.
The song sung during the last two cycles paints around six-months of chopsolidation ahead of us, followed by 6-12 months of parabolic advance.”
Source: Checkmate/X
While some are speculating that Bitcoin’s bull run may have already seen its top, Checkmate says such a scenario would be a major break from the “norm” of BTC’s past market cycles.
“If we measure from the cycle high, we see the same chorus.
Establishing a bull market top here would no question be a major break from the Bitcoin norm. It could for sure happen, but we must dig deeper to investigate…
April so far has seen prices drop by over $8,250 MoM (month over month)
I’m expecting text messages from the sidelines saying ‘Hey man, what’s up with Bitcoin, it’s down a lot, I hope you sold it?'”
Checkmate isolates every year in which a Bitcoin halving takes place, and notes that corrections like the one BTC has had since March are par for the course. The analyst also notes that the end of halving years tend to be quite bullish for Bitcoin.
“If we isolate Bitcoin halving years only (2012, 2016, 2020, 2024) we can see MoM performance via table and chart.
MoM corrections of this magnitude are the norm, not the exception, and the end of the year is usually pretty powerful (as per first charts).”

US Authorities Are Going After These Crypto Entities


																Over time, the United States government, through its regulatory agencies, has filed cases against several crypto firms, demanding compliance for their products and services.
While the list is extensive, some cases have stood out, like lawsuits against decentralized protocols like Uniswap, crypto mixing platforms like Tornado Cash, and big firms like Binance and Coinbase.
The U.S. Fights Crypto
The U.S. government’s fight against crypto entities became more intense last year. Within 48 hours in early June, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) sued Binance and Coinbase, the largest crypto exchanges globally and in the country. The allegations against the entities were similar: failure to register as brokers, national securities exchanges, clearing agencies, and violation of U.S. securities laws.
Two months after the Binance and Coinbase lawsuits, the  Department of Justice (DOJ) charged the co-founders of Tornado Cash, accusing them of laundering over $1 billion in criminal proceeds. This was a year after the Office of Foreign Assets Control sanctioned the crypto mixer for its ties to cybercrime groups.
Toward the end of last year, the SEC sued the crypto exchange Kraken on the same charges it brought against Binance and Coinbase. Around the same time, the DOJ charged Binance and its founder, Changpeng Zhao (CZ), with willfully violating the Bank Secrecy Act. The case saw the crypto exchange pay a fine of $4.3 billion, while CZ resigned from the role of CEO with a $50 million penalty.
The War Against DeFi
In March 2024, the DOJ charged crypto exchange KuCoin and its founders with violating the Bank Secrecy Act and operating an unlicensed money-transmitting business.
Last month, the SEC filed a notice of intent to sue Uniswap Labs, the company behind the largest decentralized crypto exchange Uniswap, for reasons yet to be disclosed. Around the same period, blockchain software technology company Consensys received a Wells Notice from the agency signaling intent of enforcement action against the company for violations of securities laws through its MetaMask wallet.
Also, the DOJ arrested and charged the founders of privacy-focused bitcoin wallet Samourai in the same month, accusing them of enabling over $100 million in laundered funds. At the time of writing, the wallet’s services were shut down, and its websites were seized. In addition, the DOJ recently arrested early BTC investor Roger Ver, popularly known as Bitcoin Jesus, for allegedly evading up to $50 million in taxes.
Meanwhile, one remarkable case in the industry is the SEC’s lawsuit against Ripple, which has helped the crypto community clarify crypto asset securities.

Bitcoin could drop further if this support zone is crushed


Bitcoin (BTC) has recently demonstrated a significant recovery, climbing above the $60,000 threshold, a development that follows a tumultuous week where its price dropped below $57,000 prior to the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting. 
This marked a surprising 8% drawdown, sending Bitcoin to its lowest in two months. However, amid a broader stock market rise and a weaker-than-expected US jobs report, Bitcoin’s price trajectory is looking optimistic.
In this context, RLinda, a prominent crypto analyst and professional trader, emphasized the importance of the key $64,500 level for Bitcoin in her May 5 TradingView post.


Bitcoin price analysis chart. Source: TradingView
A breakout and consolidation above this key resistance could set the stage for further growth, potentially propelling prices towards $73,000. Such a movement would signify a shift in market dynamics from neutral to decidedly bullish.

“The trend is still strong and bullish. The price is in a sideways range and continues to collect liquidity. The range boundaries are 73500 – 60000K. The key level below which there is a huge pool of liquidity is 59300-59500, there is a high probability that Bitcoin can test this area before further growth. I am expecting a rise because Bitcoin’s technical and fundamental components look very promising: Bullish trend, liquidity gathering at the expense of sellers (potential for growth), buyers are very confident to keep the price in the range, introduction of BTC-ETF in Hong Kong, which will only attract new investors and their money.”- she said

RLinda‘s analysis points out that while the $64,500 level is a crucial hurdle for Bitcoin, it’s equally important to consider the support levels that underpin the current price structure.
Key liquidity pools are observed between $59,300 and $59,500. Breaching these levels could lead to a significant price surge. However, support levels at $61,500, $60,200, and particularly $59,300 must hold to prevent further declines. If these support zones are crushed, Bitcoin could face a sharp downturn, challenging the bearish thresholds.
Market trends and strategic outlook
With increasing institutional interest, as demonstrated by substantial investments in Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETF) the bullish sentiment around Bitcoin continues to solidify. 
RLinda advises traders to closely monitor the market’s reaction to significant price levels and adjust their strategies accordingly, whether they are targeting bounce plays or preparing for potential false breakouts.
A crucial risk zone to watch is around $58,900. A breach here could indicate mounting downward pressure, confirming a bearish trend for Bitcoin. 
Conversely, maintaining momentum above the $64,500 resistance level could confirm the market’s bullish outlook, setting Bitcoin on a path toward higher valuations.

Elsewhere, a review of Bitcoin’s technical analysis shows a bullish momentum. A summary of the one-day gauges recommends ‘buy’ at 11; whole moving averages are for a ‘buy’ at 10. Despite Oscillators remaining  ‘neutral’ at 8,  there is a strong sentiment among traders anticipating an upward movement in price.
Overall, the market remains poised on the edge of a potential movement, likely setting the stage for an upcoming rally.

Bitcoin price can target $73,000 soon if this happens


Bitcoin (BTC) continues its recovery journey following a sharp decline that saw the flagship cryptocurrency plummet to as low as $56,000. 
Currently, Bitcoin is encountering resistance at the $65,000 mark, with market participants suggesting that breaching this level could propel the digital asset to above $70,000.
In this context, crypto analyst RLinda shared insights in a TradingView post on May 4, emphasizing the significance of monitoring a price target of $64,500.


According to the analysis, should Bitcoin break through and consolidate its price above this threshold, it could pave the way for further upward momentum, potentially pushing the price towards $73,000.

She highlighted that a breakout and consolidation above the $64,500 mark could signal a shift in market sentiment, transitioning from a neutral or bearish stance to a bullish one. This change in market dynamics could attract more investors, further fueling Bitcoin’s ascent.

“All eyes on 64500. Breakthrough and consolidation of the price above this level will be the reason for further growth to $73,000. A breakout and consolidation of the price above this zone ($64,500) may cause further growth,” the expert said. 

The expert also observed a local consolidation phase on the shorter timeframes, indicating that Bitcoin appears to be strengthening by 14% and testing a crucial area. This suggests a level of confidence in Bitcoin’s current trajectory.
Bitcoin’s risk areas to watch 
However, it’s important to note that the market expert pointed out that Bitcoin is not totally out of the woods yet, identifying a potential risk zone of around $58,900. 
Amidst the swirling projections surrounding Bitcoin’s price trajectory, the cryptocurrency faced a sluggish start to May, with bears seemingly gaining the upper hand over bulls. This resulted in Bitcoin’s price dipping to $56,000, marking its lowest point in approximately two months. 
The heightened volatility emerged following the Federal Reserve’s decision to maintain interest rates.
Bitcoin found some resilience in the wake of lower-than-expected United States employment data. This development will likely pressure the Fed to consider initiating an interest rate cut.
Furthermore, activity within the exchange-traded fund (ETF) sphere appears to influence Bitcoin. Particularly noteworthy were the first inflows for the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) in nearly three months, signaling renewed investor confidence.
Bitcoin price analysis
By press time, Bitcoin was trading at $63,779, boasting one-day gains of nearly 1%. On the weekly timeframe, BTC has seen an increase of about 0.26%.

Additionally, Bitcoin’s technical indicators, which are predominantly bullish, mirror the current market momentum. A summary of the one-day metrics retrieved from TradingView suggests a ‘buy’ rating at 11 while moving averages also indicate a ‘buy’ sentiment at 10. Oscillators are currently at a ‘neutral’ stance, tallying at 8.

In summary, all eyes are on Bitcoin bulls to sustain the cryptocurrency above the $63,000 mark and propel it towards the $65,000 threshold. Achieving this milestone would position the asset favorably for a potential resurgence towards the $70,000 mark.

Top Analyst Predicts Bitcoin To Hit $150,000 In 2025, Here’s Why


                            In the last week, Bitcoin has shown much resilience bouncing back above the $60,000 zone after a significant decline to below the $57,000 price zone. As Bitcoin bulls gather momentum to possibly initiate the crypto bull run, top analyst and market expert Peter Brandt has backed BTC to attain a particular six-figure digit value by 2025.


No Other Market Like Bitcoin, Brandt Says
In a blog post on May 3, Peter Brandt shared some insights on Bitcoin in celebration of his 50th anniversary in future markets trading. The veteran analyst described his experience with the maiden cryptocurrency as a “once-in-a-lifetime trade, never to be equaled”.

Brandt states that Bitcoin is a unique asset in comparison to commodities such as gold, cattle, iron ore, copper,  and even other cryptocurrencies such as altcoins and meme coins. He claims that BTC owes this uniqueness to its operational nature as well as its price behavior.
Analyzing BTC price history, Brandt notes that the coin has repeatedly produced exponential gains in the past not seen with any other trading asset. And while these gains are followed by significant corrections, the overall price performance sets BTC apart from other assets. 
Another aspect of Bitcoin’s uniqueness as highlighted by Brandt is that the asset’s volatility is also evident in its downturns resulting in a decline of more than 50% and even 75%. Therefore, Bitcoin exerts a special ability to generate substantial profits while also causing significant losses.
Now, following BTC’s parabolic price nature, Brandt predicts the asset is on course to reach $150,000 by 2025. Interestingly, if the bulls maintain market control, the analyst believes Bitcoin could rise as high as $300,000 beyond 2026.


BTC Price Overview
At the time of writing, Bitcoin trades at $63,303 having encountered serious resistance in the $64,000 price zone. The maiden cryptocurrency currently looks to be in consolidation and could be preparing for another possible breakout. 
If Bitcoin embarks on a bull run, investors would be hoping for a return to its all-time high value of $73,750. However, in the advent of more selling pressure in the future, BTC could drop below $60,000 again. Nevertheless, Bitcoin remains the diamond of the crypto bull season with several analysts hyping the digital asset to trade above $100,000 within the next 12 to 15 months.

Kraken Pro Expands Margin Trading with Shiba Inu Cryptocurrency, Emphasizing Community-Driven Growth



                    

Kraken Pro, a prominent U.S.-based cryptocurrency exchange, has recently announced the addition of new margin trading pairs, featuring Shiba Inu (SHIB), a popular meme-inspired cryptocurrency. 



This new offering allows SHIB to be traded on margin against the U.S. dollar. 




The exchange has set the maximum leverage for these transactions at three times, with a limit of 1.5 billion SHIB for both long and short positions.



Shiba Inu, known as an Ethereum-based meme coin, was first launched in 2020 by an anonymous developer named Ryoshi. 



The coin was conceptualized to explore what could happen if a cryptocurrency was entirely community-driven. 




This initiative poses the question: “What would happen if a cryptocurrency project was 100% run by its community?”



Four years after its inception, Shiba Inu has risen to become the 11th largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, which now stands at about $13.49 billion. 



Alongside SHIB, the Shiba Inu ecosystem comprises other cryptocurrencies such as BONE and LEASH, accumulating a market capitalization of approximately $180 million.

The ecosystem also includes Shibarium, a layer-2 Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) compatible blockchain, which was launched in August 2023. 



Since its launch, Shibarium has locked in a total value of $2.46 million. 



The blockchain statistics for Shiba Inu are notable, with 105,393 accounts, 1.79 million addresses, 415.52 million completed transactions, and 2,265 verified smart contracts, according to Shibariumscan.



The growth and development of Shiba Inu reflect its significant evolution from a mere dog-inspired meme to a substantial crypto ecosystem. 



Its primary token, SHIB, not only enjoys widespread acceptance as a payment method across various large platforms but also shows promise for further expansion with its continued inclusion on major trading platforms. 



This progress underscores the coin’s potential beyond the typical expectations of a meme-based cryptocurrency.

Doctor Pepe (DOCPEPE) to Explode 12,000% Ahead of MEXC Listing, as Shiba Inu, Dogecoin and Bonk Lag



                    

Early investors in memecoins like Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Bonk (BONK) made astronomical returns, and Doctor Pepe (DOCPEPE) presents a similar opportunity for a limited time.



Doctor Pepe (DOCPEPE), a newly launched Solana memecoin, is poised to explode over 12,000% in a matter of days, as former Shiba Inu (SHIB), Bonk (BONK) and Dogecoin (DOGE) investors pour funds into this new token.




DOCPEPE will be listed on MEXC, one of the largest centralized exchanges in the world, within a few days – and this is a massively bullish development for the token, as millions of new investors will easily be able to buy Doctor Pepe.



Currently, Doctor Pepe can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jupiter and Raydium, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days.



To buy DOCPEPE on these platforms, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Homo Pepe by entering its contract address – 3n8HMVVfMF2uqdpts5TUETAHUrvD1AFg8V1XLahpeTT8 – in the receiving field.




DOCPEPE currently has a market cap of just under $15,000, meaning it has huge upside potential.



Early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and Bonk (BONK) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price.



If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner.

Analyst Says Bottom Is In for Altcoin Markets, Predicts Crypto Rally Following Weak Economic Data - The Daily Hodl


								Popular analyst Michaël van de Poppe believes that crypto is gearing up for a marketwide rally amid signs of slowing economic activity.
Van de Poppe tells his 716,300 followers on the social media platform X he’s bullish on crypto after the US labor market missed estimates in April.










With unemployment rising to 3.9% and average hourly earnings growing less than expected, the analyst believes that the Fed will be forced to turn on the money printers to support the job market.
“Terrible economic data -> DXY (US dollar index) down, additionally the case for QE (quantitative easing) and rate cuts will increase and therefore risk-on assets rally.
Bitcoin back [above] $61,600.
FOMC (Federal Open Market Committee) was the low for the markets and the altcoin bull market has started.”
Looking at the market capitalization of all altcoins, the trader predicts that the alt market will witness a consolidation period before rallying to fresh all-time highs.
“The total altcoin market capitalization generally has seen the bottom of this correction. I think $880-$920 billion is the area where it’s going to stabilize, before a run towards the all-time high is on the horizon.”
Source: Michaël van de Poppe/X
The analyst also says that the return of retail traders is now in sight. He believes they will enter the crypto markets once altcoins print sizeable gains.
“Retail isn’t even in the markets, while Bitcoin is around the all-time highs.
When will they come back?
It will probably be after this summer when altcoins start to lift off.
They hold altcoins, so when they start to turn, they jump back in.
This means you’re still early.”

Token distribution tactics should focus on real value, not hype, says Uniswap founder - Crypto Briefing




While initial interest in blockchain projects might be sparked by marketing strategies like airdrops, what truly matters is what keeps users engaged with the project in the long run. Uniswap founder Hayden Adams shared his opinion on good token distribution, suggesting that token marketing should focus on providing real value, rather than merely building hype.“Don’t market token price – if you tweet about how your token is going to moon or hire influencers, or marketing firms to do so I assume you’re just trying to get rich quick vs build real value,” Adam noted in a recent discussion on the ethics of token distribution.Adam also outlined several principles he believes should guide token distributions, including the avoidance of ambiguous teasers and the necessity for real liquidity from day one.“Don’t farm the farmers – teasing and creating ambiguity around a token distribution to grow your numbers is bad behavior. If you don’t know yet, don’t speculate publicly. If you do know but are not ready to share full details, don’t tease them out. Just share real details when ready,” Adam stated.He additionally criticized the creation of low-float tokens, which he considers “malicious,” and the manipulation of token supply to exploit unit bias.“You don’t need to work with exchanges or market makers. It’s so easy. Just distribute enough tokens publicly that real price discovery happens on DEX. People should start thinking in FDV not [market cap] when valuing these things,” Adam noted. “Don’t create absurdly high token supply to farm people with unit bias, this is also bad behavior,” he added.Adam further advised against stinginess in token distribution. According to him, giving away a significant portion of tokens to the community shows a commitment to the community’s growth and trust. “If you don’t think the community deserves a significant amount, don’t release a token,” he stated.The Uniswap founder stressed the importance of making deliberate and well-considered decisions regarding token distribution. According to him, projects should be able to stand behind their choices with confidence and clear reasoning, without having to constantly defend themselves or apologize for their actions.“Put real thought and care into your decisions – so you can stand behind them and explain your rationale. Don’t end up in a situation where you’re fighting or apologizing to crypto twitter. Create something you’re proud of and stand behind it,” he stated.Adam’s comments follow recent debates surrounding token airdrops and distributions of several prominent projects, which attracted mixed opinions from the communities after announcing their tokenomics.A highly-anticipated token airdrop from LayerZero also received criticism and praise for its approach to Sybil behavior.

Binance-Listed Project Makes Official Statement on its Altcoin After Heavy Criticism - Bitcoin Sistemi


In a recent development, Cyber Capital founder Justin Bons expressed his concerns about the token offering of the cryptocurrency project Sui.
Bons criticized that more than 8 billion SUIs have been staked and more than 84% of the staked supply is controlled by the founding team. He also pointed out that the founders control most of the supply without any lock-in period and legal guarantees.


In response to these doubts expressed by the community, Sui clarified in his official response that the founders of MystenLabs do not control the Sui Foundation treasury, community reserve, staking allowances, or tokens allocated to investors. According to the statement, Sui Foundation is the largest owner of locked tokens.

In the official statement made by Sui, the following was emphasized:






“Recently, there have been some misleading posts about Sui's token offering. Let's clarify the situation, starting with the basics: locked tokens are locked by third-party custodians. They cannot be moved and are securely stored until unlocked according to Sui's token emission program. Additionally, 100% of the staking rewards earned by the Sui Foundation are returned to the community and included in the public emissions program.”

Brace for 'the biggest altseason' with $4 trillion altcoin market cap in sight


Bitcoin’s (BTC) recent surge to a record $73,750, followed by a pullback to $61,000, has set the stage for what many in the cryptocurrency sector believe could be the onset of an altcoin season. Diverse predictions from analysts hint at a massive upswing in altcoin valuations.
While Bitcoin traditionally kickstarts market cycles with a strong surge, the real action often unfolds during its consolidation phases, where other cryptocurrencies typically take the lead. This trend is expected to be more pronounced in the upcoming period, fueled by varying forecasts from leading analysts.
The integration of decentralized finance (DeFi), advancements in blockchain scalability, and the expanding use of smart contracts are key factors contributing to a potential altcoin rally, which could significantly alter the dynamics of the cryptocurrency market.


Expert predictions on altcoin breakouts
Ted, an expert analyst, recently shared an analysis on X (formerly Twitter) suggesting a significant upturn in the altcoin market. 
He pointed out a potential breakout, underpinned by technical patterns like the inverse head-and-shoulders formation, hinting at a bullish trend that could push the total market cap to $4 trillion. 
This growth is expected to unfold over the coming months, potentially reigniting significant interest from retail investors.

Furthermore, another trader and analyst Moustache highlighted in a recent post that “we are entering the largest altcoin season in at least four years”, drawing parallels from historical data.

On April 24, he noted that the total market cap of altcoins, represented by TOTAL2, had completed the ABC-correction phases of the Wyckoff method and was experiencing a breakout. This has stirred anticipation among crypto investors, as altcoins often offer higher risk-to-reward returns.
Despite these optimistic assessments, there’s a contrasting signal from the altcoin season index by Blockchain Center.
According to this index:

“If 75% of the top 50 coins performed better than Bitcoin over the last season (90 days), it is Altcoin Season.”

Top 50 performance over the last season. Source. Blockchain Center.
The index shows that only 51% of the top 50 altcoins have outperformed Bitcoin over the last 90 days. As the index is below 75, it suggests that it is not yet officially altcoin season, providing a more cautious perspective amid the enthusiastic forecast.
While the enthusiasm around an impending altcoin season is palpable, driven by technological advances and bullish analyst predictions, the more cautious altcoin season index reminds investors of the risks and uncertainties in predicting market movements. 
This blend of optimism and caution underscores the complex and dynamic nature of cryptocurrency markets, where opportunities and risks coexist.

Bitcoin: Here's how long you should wait for BTC's rally to $71K - AMBCrypto



BTC’s price moved marginally in the last 24 hours. 
Metrics and indicators suggested that BTC might turn volatile in the next seven days. 

Several investors speculated a fresh bull rally for Bitcoin [BTC] as its price gained upward momentum on the 3rd of May. 
However, the growth dropped as the king of cryptos’ price only moved marginally in the last 24 hours. Does this hint at yet another price correction? 
Is Bitcoin actually bullish?
Moustache, a popular crypto analyst, recently posted a tweet highlighting a few developments that hinted towards a bull rally. 
For the uninitiated, BTC’s price plummeted under $61k on the 30th of April. However, the king coin managed to come back above that mark, turning it into a support and hinting at a further price uptick. 
The tweet highlighted that BTC bounded up after touching a key trendline. Historically, whenever BTC’s price rebounded after touching the trendline, its price has risen sharply. 
Additionally, the Relative Strength Index (RSI) broke above a falling wedge pattern. This indicated that the RSI would increase, which supported the possibility of BTC’s bull run. 
AMBCrypto’s look at Glassnode’s data revealed yet another bullish signal. We found that Bitcoin’s reserve risk gained upward momentum inside the green zone. 
Each time this happened in the past, BTC’s price gained bullish momentum.
Source: Glassnode
What to expect from BTC
Though these aforementioned metrics looked bullish, BTC’s price action didn’t correspond. As per CoinMarketCap, BTC’s price only moved marginally in the last 24 hours. 
At the time of writing, the coin was trading at $63,368.70 with a market capitalization of over $1.25 trillion. 
However, investors mustn’t lose hope yet, as a few metrics hint at an increase in BTC’s volatility.

 AMBCrypto’s analysis of CryptoQuant’s data revealed that BTC’s net deposit on exchanges was low compared to the last seven days’ average, suggesting low selling pressure. 
The coin’s Coinbase premium was also green, meaning that buying sentiment was dominant among U.S. investors. 
Source: CryptoQuant
A few of the market indicators also suggested that BTC could turn volatile in a northward direction in the next seven days. 
Notably, the coin’s Chaikin Money Flow (CMF) registered a sharp uptick. Its MACD displayed the possibility of a bullish crossover.

If BTC manages to turn volatile next week, then it will be crucial for the coin to go above the $66.9k resistance level. A successful breakout above that level could allow BTC to touch $71k.
If everything remains bullish, then BTC can even cross its all-time high in coming days.

Uniswap CEO weighs In on ethical token distribution

Hayden Adams, Uniswap’s founder and CEO, has outlined his take on ethical considerations for effective token distribution. This comes a few days after the crypto community raised concerns about the transparency and fairness of token distribution on EigenLayer.In an X post, Adams emphasized that he was discussing tokens, not points. He then criticized the practice of teasing and creating ambiguity during token distribution to inflate engagement metrics.Adams cautioned against public speculation, mainly when the team is uncertain about future developments. He advised against teasing if one possesses information about a token distribution but does not plan to disclose the details.Source:  Hayden AdamsUsers who felt left out of the recently announced EigenLayer users who felt left out on a recently announced airdrop lashed out at the restaking protocol’s Monday announcement — highlighting its nontransferable token structure, aggressive geo-restrictions, and an apparently short snapshot period.The Uniswap executive strongly disapproved of low float tokens, considering them malicious and his biggest pet peeve. He believes that projects can effectively distribute tokens without relying on exchanges or market makers. He says the ideal approach is to distribute tokens openly, enabling genuine price discovery on decentralized exchanges (DEX).Adams also criticized the practice of creating an excessively high token supply to exploit people’s unit bias, stating that such an approach is unnecessary. Additionally, Adams advised token distributors against being too conservative, encouraging them to make a substantial portion of their tokens available for distribution.Related: SEC targets Uniswap Labs, raising concerns over open-source code liabilityHayden Adams cautioned against inadequate token distribution, particularly if the issuer does not believe the community deserves it. He also emphasized the importance of not revealing token prices during or before distribution. Any attempt to do so, whether through influencers or marketing firms, would raise suspicions about the project.According to Adams, this approach suggests that the issuer is prioritizing quick wealth over building real value. Token issuers and distributors are encouraged to maintain a straightforward distribution process, resonating with concerns raised due to recent industry rug pulls. Finally, the Uniswap executive urged token issuers to be thoughtful and transparent about their projects. He emphasized the importance of releasing a token they can be proud of and stand behind to avoid ridicule within the crypto community.EigenLayer, an Ethereum restaking protocol, distributed an additional 28 million EIGEN tokens to over 280,000 wallets following its initial airdrop, prompted by user concerns over the program’s restrictions.Magazine: The real risks to Ethena’s stablecoin model (are not the ones you think)

Vodafone Plans To Use SIM Card Tech For Blockchain-based Digital Wallets - Coin Edition


							

David Palmer underscored the importance of leveraging SIM card technology for blockchain integration.
Existing Reports show that 8 billion mobile devices will be in use by 2030.
Digital wallets on mobile phones will surge to 5.6 billion by 2030.




Vodafone Blockchain Lead and PairPoint CPO David Palmer has emphasized the pivotal role of mobile phones as the primary gateway to digital applications and commerce. In a recent interview, Palmer underscored the importance of leveraging SIM card technology for blockchain integration.







Discussing with Brian McGleenon, a renowned finance journalist, Palmer highlighted the sheer scale of mobile phone usage, citing a report predicting that 8 billion devices will be in use by 2030. He forecasted a mass adoption of blockchain-based digital wallets on mobile phones, predicting a surge to 5.6 billion wallets by 2030.



According to Palmer, the mobile phone is the touchpoint between people and accessing applications and doing business. With SIM cards as the soul of mobile phones, Palmer highlighted that his company is focusing on linking SIM cards to digital identity and blockchains.  The PairPoint CPO noted that his organization will use cryptography in the SIM cards for the planned integration.



Emphasizing the anticipated surge in digital wallets, Palmer identified the innovation as the gateway between people and financial services. He considers such wallets as tools to hold digital identity and other credentials. Hence, his company plans to link the wallets to SIM cards with the hardware needed for future transactional models.









In his view, Palmer believes the long-term pathway for the proposed innovation is to use public blockchains. He acknowledged that recent blockchain developments like Layer 2 protocols and the Ethereum fork are bringing about faster blockchains. However, he cited regulations in financial services as a factor that could prevent the use of public blockchains. 



For integration solutions, Palmer noted that PaiPoint provides a collaborative structure enabling big enterprises to use public blockchains by linking to PairPoint’s chain. That way, they can execute the Smart Contract, utilizing the private blockchain.

Dogecoin could be on the road to a 'long-term bullish rally' - Analyst’s take


Meme cryptocurrency Dogecoin (DOGE) continues to dominate the spotlight amid the ongoing market recovery, posting significant gains as it strives to breach the $0.20 resistance.
In this regard,  a crypto analyst using the pseudonym Behdark in a TradingView post on May 5 suggested that, based on technical indicators, Dogecoin’s price could be poised for a ‘long-term bullish rally.
The chart analysis indicated that Dogecoin may be in the final stages of a bullish diametric pattern with the current market position. Diametric patterns are characterized by alternating waves of price contraction and expansion, often leading to significant price swings.

Notably, the expert identified a robust support zone at $0.10, which has consistently propelled the price upwards whenever tested. This pattern suggests bullish market sentiment favoring higher prices, a factor that could instill confidence in Dogecoin traders.
DOGE enters bullish wave
According to the expert, Dogecoin appears to have entered a bullish wave marked by a notable uptrend. Compared to previous market movements, the current bullish wave is anticipated to last more than 500 days, signifying a potential sustained upward momentum.

“A strong support zone has formed on the chart (shown in green). Every time the price returns to this area, it will be rejected to the upside. From where we placed the green arrow on the chart, the price has entered a bullish wave,” the expert said. 

Additionally, the market analyst referenced a significant correction period lasting nearly 900 days preceding the current wave. In this case, such extended correction phases are typical in cryptocurrency markets and often precede substantial price movements. 
Dogecoin records spike in network activity 
Indeed, Dogecoin continues to be dominated by bullish sentiments, a trend also reflected in on-chain data. Notably, amidst the ongoing rally, data from IntoTheBlock highlighted increased network activity, contributing to sustained buying pressure surrounding the token.
For instance, data shared on May 3 indicated a significant spike in new Dogecoin addresses, with the platform adding 28,000 addresses on May 2 alone, marking a 102% increase from the monthly low observed earlier in the week.

At the same time, according to on-chain data, the coin appears to be experiencing renewed interest and engagement, evidenced by a surge in non-empty wallets. Insights provided by Santiment revealed a 27% increase in Dogecoin non-empty wallets over the last six months, totaling 6.6 million wallets.
In addition to network activity, Dogecoin is counting on other perennial catalysts to drive its price toward $0.20, a crucial level that could potentially propel the coin toward the $1 mark. Notably, investors are closely monitoring events involving Tesla (NASDAQ: TSLA) CEO Elon Musk.
In the latest development, Tesla’s payments page has been updated to include Dogecoin formally. Under this development,  DOGE will be accepted as payment for select Tesla merchandise. Furthermore, the potential role of DOGE in X Payments is a topic that has piqued investors’ interest. 
DOGE price analysis
By press time, DOGE was trading at $0.16 with daily gains of approximately 1.5%. On the weekly chart, the meme coin has seen an increase of nearly 8%.

In conclusion, it is worth noting that DOGE has increasingly traded in tandem with Bitcoin (BTC). Therefore, in addition to technical indicators and network activity, the token’s trajectory significantly hinges on how the maiden cryptocurrency performs in the market.

Solana-Based Dogwifhat and Dogecoin Pare Gains as Bitcoin Struggles to Reclaim $64K


Some of the major meme coins have pared their gains, struggling to maintain their momentum, according to CoinGecko data.At press time, Dogecoin (DOGE) is the only major cryptocurrency in the red, adding more than 1.5% over the past 24 hours.Shiba Inu (SHIB) is also in the red, losing 3% over the past 24 hours.Dogwifhat, a Solana-based upstart, is down more than 3% despite previously recording a double-digit gain.Bonk, another Solana-based cryptocurrency, is the worst performer among the leading altcoins, losing more than 8%.Greed returns to marketAccording to the "Fear and Greed" index, the market is once again dominated by greed.Yet, this excitement might be premature given that Bitcoin is still struggling to surpass the $64,000 level. The significant sentiment shift comes after the leading cryptocurrency succumbed to "fear" following a massive drop to the $56,000 level last week.Top performersWith Bitcoin being in consolidation mode, other major cryptocurrencies are also struggling to post significant gains.However, there are still some outliers. Monero (XM) and Avalanche (AVAX) are both up by almost 3%.Algorand (ALDO) and NEAR Protocol (NEAR) are also in the green despite being named as unregistered securities in the recent class action lawsuit against Coinbase.

Coinbase Charged With Operating “Fundamentally Illegal” Crypto Empire - Coin Edition


							

Coinbase is sued in a class action, claiming its token sales violate securities laws.
The lawsuit questions Coinbase’s decade-long legality of its business model.
The outcome of Coinbase’s ongoing SEC battle could influence this lawsuit’s fate.




Coinbase, the leading U.S. cryptocurrency exchange, is embroiled in a new class action lawsuit alleging its business model is fundamentally illegal. The suit was filed by Scott+Scott in the Northern District of California on Friday, April 3. It represents plaintiffs from California and Florida who claim Coinbase has consistently violated state securities laws.



Specifically, the plaintiffs claimed that Coinbase has been operating in “a shady crypto ecosystem outside the law for over ten years.” They asserted that the company’s whole business model is based on a lie: that it does not sell securities. According to them, Coinbase’s strategy seems to be hoping to get forgiven later rather than asking for permission upfront.









Notably, the legal action mirrors a previous case against Coinbase, which was initially dismissed but has since been partially revived by the U.S. Second Circuit Court of Appeals. The core issue at hand is whether the digital assets sold on Coinbase’s platform are, in fact, securities.



Coinbase has dismissed the allegations as “legally baseless” and expressed confidence in the judicial process to resolve the matter. However, this is not the company’s only legal challenge. 



It is also in a high-profile battle with the U.S. SEC over whether its listed tokens are securities. Coinbase is currently appealing a judge’s recent decision that approved the case for trial. Legal experts anticipate that the SEC’s court case will determine whether digital assets are classified as securities rather than relying on class-action lawsuits. 



Attorney John Jasnoch, known for his involvement in class-action litigation against various crypto entities, filed the new lawsuit. His previous cases have targeted projects like Safemoon and Ethereum Max, the latter of which resulted in a hefty fine for celebrity Kim Kardashian due to promotional activities.

Cardano (ADA) Founder Floats Idea to Integrate Surprise Altcoin into Cardano - Bitcoin Sistemi


Cardano (ADA) founder Charles Hoskinson has initiated discussions on X about the potential to transform Bitcoin Cash (BCH) into a “Cardano Public Chain” with advanced blockchain technologies.
More than 10,000 votes have now been cast, with 65% supporting the proposal.


Hoskinson's proposal aims to increase Bitcoin Cash's functionality as a proof-of-work chain by integrating it with Cardano's technological features.
Bitcoin Cash, a fork of the original Bitcoin protocol, was launched in 2017 to address scalability issues by increasing the cryptocurrency block size. Over the years, it has developed a unique community and found its place in the world of digital assets. Despite the legal challenges faced by prominent supporter Roger Ver, the Bitcoin Cash community remains active with ongoing projects aimed at improving the usability and adoption of the network.






Roger Ver was recently arrested in Spain and the extradition process to the USA was initiated.
Hoskinson's interest extends beyond the proposal in question. Hoskinson recently expressed curiosity about Bitcoin Cash's current developments and future roadmap. In another social media post, he asked the community to share details of ongoing projects and priorities in the BCH ecosystem.

Are Ethereum And XRP Securities? Ripple CEO Weighs In On The Debate


								The US Securities and Exchange Commission has long been at loggerheads with the crypto industry, especially concerning the security status of some cryptocurrencies. Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse recently had some strong opinions on the matter that he’s not afraid to share. While speaking at an interview, Garlinghouse noted that the SEC is “grossly wrong” in its approach of classifying both XRP and ETH as securities. 

Garlinghouse: XRP And ETH Are Clearly Not Securities
Garlinghouse’s take on the matter was first brought to light in a social media post by Fox Business journalist Eleanor Terrett. His comments were made in a fireside chat that took place in Las Vegas to discuss the future of digital assets. 


It is no longer news that Ripple and the SEC have been in a legal tussle for the past few years regarding the security status of XRP, a cryptocurrency created by the payments technology company. Similarly, there have been recent reports that players at the SEC are now looking into Ethereum on whether it qualifies as a security or not.
Ripple and Garlinghouse have taken a strong stance over the years and remain steadfast regarding XRP’s non-security status. The CEO has now reiterated his view and made some comments that crypto enthusiasts and investors would love to hear.
Apart from saying that XRP and ETH are not securities, Garlinghouse noted that SEC Gary Gensler is an “unethical human being.” This is most likely because of his criticisms against the cryptocurrency industry, which many investors have deemed to be unjust.

Ethereum is now trading at $3138. Chart: TradingView
The Future Of Crypto Regulation
Garlinghouse’s comments have come at a critical time when regulators are closely monitoring cryptocurrencies. The crypto industry is yet to have a clear-cut regulatory mechanism and regulators around the world are working to make this a reality. 
Interestingly, XRP is now the only cryptocurrency with regulatory clarity in the US after a federal judge declared the sale of XRP to retail investors sale of non-securities. However, both parties are still in court regarding the sale of XRP to institutional investors. Most analysts think the case will eventually result in a settlement. 
At the time of writing, XRP is trading at $0.53. Its failure to break above $1 for the past two years has led some investors and crypto analysts to label it as being dead in terms of investment.

According to a Fox Business report, SEC Chair Gensler could be looking to class Ethereum as a security under the Howey Test. As the second largest cryptocurrency, Ethereum’s classification as a security could lead to a chain reaction of setbacks in its growth and other cryptocurrencies.
While Garlinghouse is critical of the SEC’s handling of crypto regulation, he is optimistic about regulations emerging outside the US, especially in the European Union.

Where to store your crypto: Wallets provide diverse options for holders

Being in control of your own assets — having total freedom of how and to whom they are sent — is a foundational tenant of cryptocurrencies. Today, over 10,000 cryptocurrencies exist on a multitude of blockchains. With the increased adoption and proliferation of digital assets, crypto users have more options than ever regarding how they store their assets.However, there are trade-offs to consider: Hot wallets, those connected to the internet, are convenient for making frequent transactions but are more susceptible to hacks. Conversely, cold wallets are far more secure but more suited to storing crypto than actively using it. Further consideration must be given to whether a wallet is custodial or noncustodial, meaning whether the user is in charge of their own private keys or whether a third party holds them. Custodial wallets may be easier to use, especially for newcomers to cryptocurrency, but they are more exposed to security breaches, censorship, fees and fraud.With all of these complicated choices, Cointelegraph looked at five different wallets to consider their strengths and weaknesses. MetaMaskMetaMask is a decentralized wallet that has been downloaded over 22 million times as of 2023. It is available as a browser extension and mobile application, which users can download for free.The wallet is noncustodial and supports Ether (ETH) and ERC-20 tokens by default, but it can also connect to BNB Chain, Polygon, Optimism and others, as well as decentralized finance (DeFi) and GameFi applications.MetaMask’s user interface is relatively straightforward. Users can send and receive crypto by copying a wallet address or using a QR code. They can also purchase ETH with fiat through the “Wire” and “CoinSwitch” options. Users can also import an existing wallet using a saved JSON file with a private key. Hardware wallets like Trezor or Ledger can be connected to MetaMask, but this feature is available only on the browser version. However, MetaMask does not support popular cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin (BTC), Tronix (TRX) and XRP (XRP), which may be a disadvantage for some users.Security is also a concern, as MetaMask has long been a popular target for scammers. One well-known scam tactic redirects unwary users to fake websites that request access to their MetaMask wallets. Metamask wallet.

It was created with the support of crypto exchange Binance.The wallet boasts several safety features, including a PIN code, login password, fingerprint scan and even a built-in self-destruct mechanism. It also has an air-gapped sign-in mechanism that does not require users to connect to the internet or Bluetooth.The device has the same internal hardware security — the Secure Element chip — as Ledger hardware wallets, but it is somewhat cheaper at $49.99.The SafePal S1 allows users to store a potentially unlimited number of cryptocurrencies on 54 different blockchains. It also has its own utility token, SafePal Token (SFP), which is listed on Binance. The wallet has a lithium battery that charges in three hours and can last up to 20 days.SafePal S1 wallet.

The wallet also supports nonfungible tokens (NFTs).The wallet boasts a number of integrations, such as the ability to purchase crypto with fiat through the Simplex payments system. Thanks to its acquisition by Binance, users can also transfer crypto directly from their Binance funding wallet to Trust Wallet.

The wallet is also anonymous, so users don’t need to provide personal data to create a wallet.However, the wallet’s reputation took a hit in April 2023 when developers discovered a vulnerability in the browser extension that could allow hackers to steal funds. Hackers made off with nearly $170,000 through the exploit. Developers fixed the problem once it was flagged, and the wallet reimbursed affected users. The issue affected only wallets created through the Trust Wallet browser extension. Trust Wallet.

A more secure 24-word phrase cannot be generated. Coinbase Wallet. Source: CoinbaseAfter reviewing these five wallets, it can be concluded that there is no such thing as the ideal crypto wallet. When choosing a wallet, users must decide for which purposes they need it, whether that be to make transfers to other users, trade on cryptocurrency exchanges, or store savings. Desktop or mobile crypto wallets are more suitable for everyday use, payment and receiving transfers. Recent: USDC overtakes USDT: Compliance is key to stablecoin dominanceOnline services are good for those just starting to understand cryptocurrencies, but storing large sums on them is not recommended. Crypto holders can also combine various options, such as using a cold wallet to store assets in the long term while using a hot wallet for everyday trading or spending. The possibilities only grow along with greater crypto adoption.

Nigeria could halt P2P crypto trading tomorrow


The Nigerian government is taking further steps to regulate the cryptocurrency sector, with the latest move focusing on managing peer-to-peer (P2P) trading within the country. 
Specifically, through the country’s Securities Exchange Commission, the government is reportedly considering suspending P2P trading after a scheduled meeting on May 6, local media outlet Punch reported on May 5. 
The move to regulate the $56.7 billion P2P market comes amid growing concerns about the potential use of cryptocurrencies to facilitate illicit activities and the possible devaluation of the local currency, the naira.


According to the publication, the suspension may be temporary, intended to allow the government to establish a comprehensive set of rules. Sources familiar with the matter indicated that authorities may engage with crypto sector players to develop the regulations.

“The newly appointed Director General of the Nigeria Securities and Exchange Commission has proposed an industry-wide meeting with the Nigeria blockchain community. The meeting will be facilitated by the Blockchain Industry Coordinating Committee of Nigeria,” said the Blockchain Industry Coordinating Committee of Nigeria (BICCoN).

Need for crypto rules clarity 
Interestingly, crypto stakeholders hope the meeting will clarify the sector’s rules. For instance, the President of the Stakeholders in Blockchain Technology Association of Nigeria, Obinna Iwuno, noted that they hope to finally get clarity.

“There is a whole lot going on. It is not just clear the direction as we speak, but hopefully, on Monday, we will get to have a position,” Iwuno said. 

The Nigerian central bank had hinted at possible trade regulation following the institution’s decision to bar major fintech firms from onboarding new customers as part of an ongoing audit of their Know-Your-Customer (KYC) process.
Notably, at least three prominent fintech startups—Moniepoint, Paga, and Palmpay— opted to block accounts engaged in crypto transactions and report such activities to law enforcement authorities.
Role of crypto in Nigeria
Overall, this development could be a setback for cryptocurrency traders in Nigeria, estimated to number 33.4 million. Many rely on trading as a source of income in Africa’s most populous country.
It’s worth noting that many Nigerians have turned to cryptocurrencies partly as a hedge against the devaluation of the local currency, the naira. 
As reported by Finbold, the Nigerian naira has continued its downward trend against the United States dollar, reaching a new record low due to foreign currency shortages.

Is THIS threatening the Solana ecosystem? Yes, but here's why SOL is safe - AMBCrypto



Sui Network flipped Solana in terms of transaction activity.
DEX volumes on the network plummeted as the TVL continued to soar.

Activity on the Solana [SOL] has grown significantly over the past few months. However, recently, other competitors were seen to be going toe to toe with the network.
For instance, the SUI network recently outperformed Solana in terms of daily transactions.
This indicated that not only Solana was having a tough time attracting new users and creating engagement in its ecosystem, but the users were also moving to other networks and ecosystems.
Solana is not really in trouble
However, not all of these transactions are legitimate. In a recent tweet, Artemis clarified that a large number of transactions that were occurring on the SUI network were being caused by Spam Sui.
For context, the Sui network has a dApp called Spam Sui that offers a unique “Spam to Earn” concept. Unlike traditional crypto mining, you earn “SPAM” coins simply by sending transactions on the Sui network.
The more transactions you send, the more SPAM you receive.
With a staggering daily creation of one billion SPAM coins, the focus is on generating a high volume of transactions.
Source: X
So, it is hard to believe that the Sui network will be able to dethrone Solana anytime soon, despite the slowdown of activity on the latter’s network.
State of DeFi
Another factor that could impact the Solana ecosystem would be the state of its DeFi. Notably, the DEX (Decentralized Exchange) volumes on the Solana network had fallen significantly since March.
Poor DEX performances signal that users are opting for other networks for trading and swapping purposes.
Source: Artemis
Despite the plummeting DEX volumes, the TVL (Total Value Locked) on the Solana network had continued to grow, reaching $4 Billion at press time.

Realistic or not, here’s SOL’s market cap in ETH terms

This suggested that while Solana’s DEXes were not able to show positive performance, other sectors managed to pick up the slack and were able to generate value.
Source: Artemis
Coming to the state of the SOL token, it was observed to be moving mostly sideways. In the last 24 hours, the price of SOL had grown by 0.55% and was trading at $144.98 at the time of writing.

These Divisions Contributed Significantly to Tether’s Q1 2024 Profit of $4.52B


																Earlier this week, the largest stablecoin issuing company, Tether, revealed that it made more than $4.52 billion in net profit in the first quarter of 2024. With the firm having expanded its operations recently, a substantial portion of the profits came from its long-standing businesses and not the newly formed divisions.
Tether revealed in an attestation report that roughly $1 billion of the profit in Q1 2024 came from entities in charge of issuing stablecoins and managing related reserves.
Tether Made $4.52B in Profit Last Quarter
In mid-April, Tether announced that it was expanding its framework beyond stablecoins. The firm unveiled new divisions, including Tether Edu, Tether Power, and Tether Data, which would handle digital skills education, sustainable Bitcoin mining operations, and strategic investments in emerging technologies.
Tether Finance, which has been in existence, will continue spearheading the company’s stablecoin products and financial services. Tether revealed that the $1 billion this division made last quarter came from net operating profits derived mainly from its U.S. Treasury holdings. During the quarter, Tether increased its direct and indirect ownership of U.S. Treasuries via investments through money market funds and overnight reverse-repurchase agreements.
The remainder of Tether Q1 2024 profits came from mark-to-market gains in the company’s Bitcoin and Gold positions. Notably, the firm’s U.S. Treasury holdings are now in excess of $90 billion.




“With the first attestation of 2024, Tether has demonstrated its unwavering commitment to transparency, stability, liquidity, and responsible risk management. As shown in this latest report, Tether continues to shatter records with a new profit benchmark of $4.52 billion, reflecting the company’s sheer financial strength and stability,” Tether CEO Paolo Ardoino said.
For the other divisions, encompassing renewable energy, artificial intelligence, peer-to-peer communications, and Bitcoin mining, Tether made strategic investments totaling $5 billion in Q1 2024.
Additional $12.5B USDT Issued
Interestingly, Tether unveiled its net equity for the first time. The company witnessed a significant spike from the $7.01 billion recorded by the end of Q4 2023 to $11.37 billion as of March 31.
Meanwhile, Tether claims its stablecoin offerings saw a $1 billion increase in excess reserves, bringing the total to approximately $6.3 billion. Tether-issued stablecoins are now backed by cash and cash equivalents at 90%. The company also issued an additional $12.5 billion USDT last quarter.

Here’s the Next Price Target for Bitcoin As BTC Repeats Previous Bull Market Pattern: Crypto Analyst - The Daily Hodl


								A widely followed crypto analyst is laying out his bull market price target for Bitcoin, saying BTC is beginning to mirror its previous cycle.
Pseudonymous analyst TechDev shares with his 448,000 followers on the social media platform X a chart that compares Bitcoin’s current market cycle to that of 2020-2021.










Using Elliott Wave theory, which traditionally suggests that an asset goes through bullish impulses in five main waves, TechDev speculates that BTC is going through a final bullish move that will take it near the six-figure range later this year.
“The impulsive structure of the last 1.5 years says $90,000-$100,000 is next. BTC”
Source: TechDev/X
Based on his chart, TechDev is also suggesting that Bitcoin’s relative strength index (RSI) – a widely used momentum indicator – has cooled off, foreshadowing one more big upside move for BTC.
The analyst recently predicted that BTC will rally by over 120%, similar to what happened in late 2020 when Bitcoin surged from around $13,000 to over $29,000 in just two months.
“Bitcoin’s two-month candle is right on the candle body high, soon after max compression.
As RSI (relative strength index) is about to break 70.
These have been the conditions which led to the last three parabolic accelerations.
I suspect this next two-month candle will be as tall as Nov 2020.”

At time of writing, Bitcoin is trading at $63,330.

Satoshi's Privacy Legacy Reverberates Through Dogecoin; What Happened

In response to a recent observation that raised privacy concerns, vocal Dogecoin community member Mishaboar has echoed the principles laid out by Satoshi Nakamoto, the pseudonymous creator of Bitcoin.As outlined in the original whitepaper released in 2008, Satoshi envisioned privacy, which ties into the idea of decentralization.While Bitcoin's blockchain is transparent, Satoshi acknowledged the need for privacy, suggesting that users could maintain anonymity by keeping their public keys secret.Satoshi wrote that the traditional banking model achieves a level of privacy by limiting access to information to the parties involved and the trusted third party.The reverse occurs in the Bitcoin network, where all transactions are publicly announced; however, Satoshi contends that privacy can still be maintained by breaking the flow of information in another place: by keeping public keys anonymous. The public can see that someone is sending an amount to someone else but there is no information linking the transaction to anyone.Satoshi proposes that, as an additional firewall, a new key pair should be used for each transaction to keep them from being linked to a common owner.What happenedIn a recent tweet, Mishaboar, a Dogecoin community member, draws the community's attention to something apparent but often overlooked: self-custody equals privacy. He stated that most blockchains, including Bitcoin and Dogecoin, are entirely transparent, with a public ledger open to everybody, allowing anybody to see and track transactions. Mishaboar explained that in the original Bitcoin whitepaper, Satoshi Nakamoto suggested ways to protect privacy, including avoiding the reuse of addresses. However, this requires wallet apps that are developed with this in mind.The vocal Dogecoin community member cited an instance: Privacy-oriented wallets discourage users from reusing addresses and incorporate easy-to-use coin control features. However, this does not appear to be the case, as many wallet apps still push users toward a single address use.

Manager to Establish $ 1.25 Billion Cryptocurrency Fund Talks About Crypto Sector: "There is a Future in These Two Areas" - Bitcoin Sistemi


According to Franklin Bi, a general partner at Pantera Capital, the recent approval of spot Bitcoin ETFs in the US has significantly validated the cryptocurrency industry. The crypto venture capital firm is currently raising a new mega fund worth $1.25 billion.
While Bi declined to comment specifically on Pantera's new fund, he stated in an interview that the current climate is conducive for venture firms to raise new capital and position themselves to support new ventures.


Bi said the spot Bitcoin ETF approval “significantly validates” the crypto industry. “This approval showed people that regulations are still moving in a positive direction for digital assets,” Bi said. According to Bi, this confirmation reinforced the belief of many institutional investors that this is a long-term technology trend and a development cycle they need exposure to.

Within the crypto industry, Bi suggested that the gaming and decentralized finance (DeFi) sectors offer significant investment opportunities. He also noted the emergence of real-world asset tokenization as a continuation of DeFi, which brings traditional financial assets into the crypto space.





Bi added that blockchain technology is entering various global markets, including financial markets, supply chains and consumer applications. “I think it's a great time to really focus on those aspects of the industry and move forward in the long term, and that's what we're doing,” Bi concluded.

FLOKI: Is a bull rally on the way? Examining key indicators - AMBCrypto



FLOKI’s popularity was high as its social metrics soared.
The meme coin witnessed a slight price correction, but the trend might not last. 

Meme coins have created a lot of buzz of late, including Floki Inu [FLOKI], thanks to the surge in their popularity. 
At press time, the price of FLOKI broke above a bullish pattern, which might translate into a bull rally. 
FLOKI’s bullish move
AMBCrypto’s analysis of FLOKI’s daily chart revealed an interesting development. After peaking in mid-March, the meme coin’s price started to move inside a bullish flag pattern. 
It continued to consolidate inside the pattern for over a month and finally broke out on the 4th of May. A breakout above the bullish flag pattern suggested that FLOKI’s price might soon touch its March high again.
Source: TradingView
Things on the social front also looked optimistic for the meme coin. Per LunarCrush’s recent tweet, the meme coin’s social metrics were soaring, as over 48% of the market remained positive on FLOKI. 
Also, the meme coin’s official X (formerly Twitter) handle mentioned that FLOKI was trending on the social media site, reflecting its popularity. 
However, despite these optimistic signs, the meme coin’s price witnessed a correction. According to CoinMarketCap, the meme coin’s value plummeted by 1.5% in the last 24 hours. 
At press time, it was trading at $0.0001909. 
The bull trend might resume 
Investors should not be worried yet about the price drop, as a breakout above a bull flag pattern is often followed by a retest of the support level. Therefore, a slight price drop ahead of another bull rally is not rare.
AMBCrypto found that a possible reason for the recent price decline could be high liquidation. The meme coin’s liquidation increased sharply to the $0.0002 mark, after which its price dropped. 
Source: Hyblock Capital
AMBCrypto’s analysis of Santiment’s data suggested that the declining trend might not last. For instance, after an increase, FLOKI’s Funding Rate dropped. 
Generally, prices tend to move the other way around than the Funding Rate. Its MVRV ratio also remained pretty high, which can be inferred as a bullish signal.
 Nonetheless, its exchange inflow spiked, suggesting a rise in selling pressure. 
Source: Snatiment
To better understand whether the bull rally would resume, AMBCrypto then checked the meme coin’s daily chart.

Read Floki Inu’s [FLOKI] Price Prediction 2024-25  

As per our analysis, the meme coin’s Chaikin Money Flow (CMF) registered an uptick and was headed further above the neutral mark. 
Its MACD also displayed the possibility of a bullish crossover. These metrics and indicators suggested that the chances of FLOKI’s price turning bullish again in the coming days were high.

Bitcoin soars 12,464% in a decade outshining Amazon, Google; What's next for BTC?


In the past decade, Bitcoin (BTC) has posted an extraordinary 12,464% increase in its price, outshining tech giants such as Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN), Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ: GOOGL), and Netflix (NASDAQ: NFLX)
The analysis, published on X (formerly Twitter) on May 3 by WuBlockchain, examined Bitcoin’s performance alongside nine major technology stocks. This study highlighted its robust growth, further solidifying its reputation as a powerful  investment vehicle
The research revealed that  Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) led the pack with an even more impressive gain of 17,797%, dominating the tech sector with its cutting-edge GPUs and semiconductor products. However, Bitcoin’s rise to the second place, especially in such a volatile market, underscores its significant impact and potential within the financial ecosystem.



“The WuBlockchain team compiled the cumulative gains over the past 10 years of BTC and nine major tech stocks including Google, META, Apple, Netflix, and Amazon etc. BTC ranked second with an increase of 12,464%, while NVIDIA took the top spot with a surge of 17,797%”.-Wu Blockchain”

Other tech entities like Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ: AMD)  and Tesla (NASDAQ: TSLA) also showed considerable gains, with increases of 3,335% and 1,200% respectively. These figures demonstrate the dynamic growth within the tech industry, yet Bitcoin’s performance remains a notable story of success and resilience.

Despite the inherent volatility and uncertainties associated with cryptocurrencies, Bitcoin’s impressive growth trajectory over the past decade showcases its resilience and potential as a viable investment avenue.
As investors continue to diversify their portfolios and seek avenues for potentially high returns, the findings of this analysis offer a valuable reference point, highlighting the noteworthy performance of both established tech stocks and emerging digital assets like Bitcoin.
With technological innovation driving the markets forward, the intersection of traditional finance and digital assets presents new opportunities for investors to explore and capitalize on in the years to come.
Market Cap reshuffle among the Magnificent Seven
Recently, Nvidia has demonstrated a positive trajectory by rising above its 50-day moving average, setting a target for a stable price base with a buy point of 974. Google has maintained its upward momentum following a positive earnings report, whereas Meta experienced a significant setback on April 24, falling below its 50-day moving average.
In contrast, Tesla(TSLA), has rebounded above this key technical level after reporting strong earnings, a recovery mirrored by Amazon which also rallied following impressive earnings.
These movements have led to notable shifts in the market capitalization rankings among the top tech companies, often dubbed the “Magnificent Seven.” Microsoft has overtaken Apple in terms of Nasdaq market cap share, now making up 9.5% of the index compared to Apple’s 8.6%. 
Nvidia, with a market cap share of 6.9%, has surpassed both Alphabet at 6.6% and Amazon at 6.2%. Meanwhile, Meta’s share has declined to 3.6%.
These market dynamics have also impacted the Composite Ratings of these firms. Apple’s rating has dropped to 53, despite a recent earnings boost. This reshuffling reflects the volatile yet dynamic nature of tech stock performance and market valuations.
The Road ahead for Bitcoin

By press time, Bitcoin was trading at $63,800 with daily corrections of almost 0.86%. On the weekly chart, Bitcoin is down over 0.07%
Despite recent market downturns and a significant reduction in block mining rewards experts remain optimistic about Bitcoin’s long-term prospects.
Concerns about mining centralization and regulatory challenges persist, but the scarcity of Bitcoin, capped at 21 million tokens, is a critical factor that continues to drive its value. Looking ahead, industry insiders suggest that while the market may face short-term fluctuations, the long-term trajectory for Bitcoin looks promising.
As Bitcoin continues to compete with and even surpass major tech stocks, its role as a transformative asset in the investment landscape is becoming more pronounced.

Bitcoin Whale 'Mr. 100' Resumes Buying Amid Market Dip, Analysts Anticipate Price Consolidation and Potential Upswing



                    

The notable Bitcoin whale known as “Mr. 100” recently made a significant purchase of Bitcoin, marking his first buy since the Bitcoin halving event in April 2024. 



As the Bitcoin price briefly dipped to $56,000, Mr. 100 added over 4,100 BTC to his holdings, purchased around the $58,000 level. 




This acquisition, valued at approximately $242 million, was highlighted by the analysis of on-chain data from Bitinfocharts, brought to attention by user HODL15Capital.



This transaction comes after a hiatus since April 19, the day before the halving, during which the whale did not acquire any additional Bitcoin. 



The “Mr. 100” wallet, which began receiving regular BTC deposits following the November 2022 collapse of FTX, had been consistently accumulating at least 100 BTC daily since mid-February, excluding the period right after the halving.




Currently, “Mr. 100” holds over 65,155 BTC, making him the 12th-largest Bitcoin holder. The value of his wallet now exceeds $3.86 billion, with unrealized profits of $1.4 billion, a 33% increase from the average purchase price of $36,572 per BTC.



Amid this buying activity, market analysts have been debating the trajectory of Bitcoin’s price. 



Analyst Rekt Capital suggested in a May 2 video analysis that the current market conditions represented a prime buying opportunity, explaining, “Whenever we’d get close to a 20% downside, that was typically a fantastic buying opportunity before price reversals towards the upside. 



So if we’re deeper than 20%, it is an even better opportunity than we had this cycle, because the deeper we go the closer we get to a bottoming in Bitcoin’s price action.”




Other experts, like Jag Kooner from Bitfinex, predict a short-term consolidation in Bitcoin prices. 



Kooner anticipates a trading range with significant swings over the next couple of months, influenced by macroeconomic factors. 



He told Cointelegraph, “We could see a one-to-two-month consolidation in Bitcoin prices, trading in a range with swings of $10,000 on either side.

We expect the positive impact of the halving, which has brought about a reduction in Bitcoin supply, will be seen in later months. 



At this point, the economy is also expected to be performing better, having achieved a soft landing and avoiding a recession, providing further impetus to crypto assets.”



The $52,000 mark is seen as a crucial support-resistance level on Bitcoin’s weekly chart. A close above this threshold would likely indicate potential for further gains, according to crypto trader Marco Johanning.



Further context about the “Mr. 100” address was provided by Crystal Intelligence to Cointelegraph, identifying the address as associated with the Upbit exchange. 



The firm clarified, “We have found that the number and value of transactions associated with this wallet are indicative of a VASP-type service. 



‘Additionally, we can confirm with high accuracy that the incoming transactions originate from Upbit, and these have maintained a consistent value since the collapse of FTX.” 



This analysis was reinforced by the findings of Mai, an on-chain sleuth, who noted the operational similarities between Mr. 100’s transactions and Upbit’s typical activity with altcoins.

Warren Buffett compares AI to nukes after seeing deepfake doppelganger

Berkshire Hathaway co-founder Warren Buffett recently sounded off on artificial intelligence (AI) deepfakes and the perpetuation of scammers at the company’s annual shareholder meeting. Buffett, the ninth richest person in the world (as of April 2024), has seen his own net worth grow by some $16 billion through the first five months of 2024 alone. During the shareholders meeting held in Omaha, Nebraska he lauded the company’s growth and perseverance despite the November 2023 death of vice chairman Charlie Munger. However, the commentary quickly turned to AI as the meeting wore on. Speaking during a Q&A session, Buffett said “I don’t know anything about AI but that doesn’t mean I deny its existence or importance or anything of the sort." After this auspicious start, he compared the impact of AI technologies in illicit financial activities to the advent of the atomic bomb and the proliferation of nuclear weaponry. This, as the 93-year-old billionaire related it, stemmed from an experience he had wherein he was exposed to a deepfake doppelganger that looked, dressed, moved, and talked exactly like himself. Per a transcript of the meeting:“I mean, scamming has always been part of the American scene, but this would make me, if I was interested in investing in scamming, it’s going to be the growth industry of all time. And it’s enabled in a way. Obviously, AI has potential for good things too but I don’t know how you, based on the one I saw recently, I practically would send money to myself over and over in some crazy country."While this isn’t the first time that Buffett has decried what he sees as the scary potential of AI, it’s notable that Berkshire Hathaway’s largest investment holdings lie in the world’s second most valuable company, Apple. The Cupertino company’s number one spot was usurped by Microsoft who metaphorically strapped itself to a rocketship when it invested heavily in ChatGPT maker OpenAI. In the time since, it’s appeared as though Apple has been playing catch up. With a large portion of the company’s public-facing focus being placed on generative AI products.

Bitcoin Bull Michael Saylor Wants SEC To Corral Crypto Herd: ETH, ADA, SOL In The Crosshairs


								Michael Saylor, the tech entrepreneur who steered MicroStrategy into a Bitcoin behemoth, is back in the headlines. This time, he’s not championing the orange coin, but rather aiming his laser focus at its altcoin rivals.

At the recent Bitcoin For Corporations conference, Saylor unleashed a flurry of predictions, painting a picture of a future where the SEC cracks down on leading altcoins like Ethereum (ETH), Binance Coin (BNB), Solana (SOL), Ripple (XRP), and Cardano (ADA).
Bitcoin’s Lone Wolf? Saylor Casts Doubt On Altcoin Legitimacy
Saylor’s stance on altcoins is about as subtle as a Bitcoin mining rig – there simply isn’t room for another top dog. He boldly claimed that the SEC will reject all applications for spot ETH ETFs, effectively throwing cold water on the hopes of investors eagerly awaiting such a product.


But it doesn’t stop there. Saylor predicts the SEC will reclassify these altcoins as securities, yanking them away from their current status as commodities under the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC). This regulatory shift would significantly impact how these altcoins are traded and viewed by institutions.

“None of these tokens will ever be a part of a spot ETF, none of them will be embraced by Wall Street, and none of them will find favor with mainstream institutional investors as crypto assets,” declared Saylor.

His comments come at a crucial time, with the entire crypto market holding its breath as the SEC mulls over applications for Ethereum ETFs from investment giants like VanEck and Ark Invest. The deadlines for these decisions fall on May 23rd and 24th, respectively, making the next few weeks a potential turning point for the altcoin landscape.

SEC’s Past Hints At Saylor’s Prophetic Potential?
While Saylor’s predictions carry the weight of his industry expertise, it’s important to acknowledge his inherent bias as a Bitcoin maximalist. However, a look at the SEC’s recent history suggests there might be some truth to his warnings.

In 2023, the regulatory body came down hard on major crypto exchanges like Binance and Coinbase. The former’s case concluded with a hefty fine and imprisonment for its CEO, Changpeng Zhao, while the legal battle with Coinbase continues to unfold. These actions by the SEC demonstrate a growing focus on regulating the crypto space, and Saylor’s predictions might be a glimpse into the future of altcoin oversight.
Brace For Impact Or Business As Usual?
Saylor’s pronouncements have sent ripples through the altcoin community. Some fear a domino effect, with the SEC’s potential crackdown on ETH impacting the entire altcoin market. Others remain cautiously optimistic, believing the SEC’s focus might be on unregistered securities masquerading as altcoins, not established players like ETH or ADA.
The coming weeks will be crucial in determining the validity of Saylor’s prophecies. If the SEC denies the applications for spot ETH ETFs and moves towards classifying leading altcoins as securities, it could significantly reshape the cryptocurrency landscape.
However, if the SEC takes a more measured approach, focusing on weeding out bad actors while allowing compliant altcoins to flourish, then Saylor’s pronouncements might fade into the background noise of the ever-evolving crypto world.

Uniswap CEO Condemns ‘Farming the Farmers’ Tactics in Token Launches - Coin Edition


							

Hayden Adams stressed the importance of treating tokens as more than mere points.
He condemned the “farming the farmers” practice, where projects artificially hype token distribution to boost numbers.
Adams’ commentary comes amid recent outrage over EigenLayer’s token distribution methods.




Hayden Adams, the founder of the Uniswap DEX platform, has outlined his perspective on ethical token distribution, offering eight key principles. Adams’ commentary comes amid recent community concerns over transparency in token distribution, particularly in light of issues raised with EigenLayer’s distribution methods, where industry pundits have labeled it a scam.









Adams began by highlighting the importance of treating tokens as more than mere points. Next, he condemned the practice of “farming the farmers,” where projects create hype around token distribution to boost user engagement artificially. He advised against making public speculations without concrete information and recommended withholding details until they could be fully disclosed.







Furthermore, the Uniswap founder expressed a distaste for “low float” tokens, which he considers manipulative. He argues that projects should enable genuine price discovery from day one by distributing tokens widely enough for decentralized exchanges to determine their actual value.



Fourthly, Adams criticized the tactic of exploiting unit bias through excessively high token supplies, labeling it as unethical. In parallel, he called for generosity in distribution. “Don’t be stingy,” the industry pundit said. Adams recommended that a significant portion of tokens be allocated to the community supporting the project.



Meanwhile, he took a firm stance against marketing token prices. He suggested that projects focusing on price hype are more interested in quick profits than creating lasting value. 



Besides, the Uniswap founder urged simplicity in the distribution process to avoid the complexities that have led to scams in the past.



His parting message is one of integrity: create an effective token distribution model that project leaders can be proud of and support wholeheartedly.

Doctor Pepe (DOCPEPE) Rallies 225% in 5 Hours and Prepares for 3,000% Surge, While Shiba Inu and Dogecoin Struggle



                    

Doctor Pepe (DOCPEPE), a newly launched Solana memecoin, has been attracting significant investment from early Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) buyers.



Doctor Pepe (DOCPEPE) has surged around 225% in the first few hours since its launch,  delivering huge returns for early investors and attracting investment from early Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) buyers.




However, DOCPEPE still has plenty of potential to rise more, and it’s poised to rally another 3,000% in the coming 48 hours.



Furthermore, it has already been announced that the token will soon be listed on MEXC – as its first listing on a centralized exchange – and this will be another massively bullish event for its price.



Despite the rally so far, DOCPEPE still just has a market cap of around $34,000, meaning it has immense potential for more gains in the coming days and weeks.




Currently, Doctor Pepe can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jupiter and Raydium, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days.



To buy DOCPEPE on these platforms, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for DOCPEPE by entering its contract address – 3n8HMVVfMF2uqdpts5TUETAHUrvD1AFg8V1XLahpeTT8 – in the receiving field.



Early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and Bonk (BONK) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price.



If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner.

JPMorgan Chase Paying $448,000,000 Fine To US Regulators for Failing To Monitor Billions of Transactions on Bank's Global Trading Venues - The Daily Hodl


								JPMorgan Chase will pay a total of $448 billion to US regulators for failing to monitor potential market misconduct on billions of transactions in its global trading operation.
In a filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), the banking giant says it has made a deal with an unnamed US regulator that will add an additional $100 billion in penalties to a $348 billion enforcement action by the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) and the Federal Reserve Board (FRB).










In March, the two regulatory agencies accused JPMorgan of engaging in “unsafe or unsound” banking practices, saying that the lender’s corporate and investment bank division had significant gaps in its trade surveillance program. According to the OCC, the bank failed to properly monitor the actions of its traders and clients to detect potential market misconduct on billions of trading activities on at least 30 global trading venues.
Now, the banking giant says it’s paying an additional $100 million “after offsets for amounts paid to the OCC and FRB” to another US regulator to settle a separate enforcement action involving the same issue.
While JPMorgan does not name the third regulator involved, the firm says it “self-identified that certain trading and order data” at its Corporate & Investment Bank (CIB) was not feeding into its trade surveillance platforms.
The firm says it’s now determined to continuously enhance the reliability of its trade infrastructure and maintain rigorous controls.
Data from the Violation Tracker, a comprehensive corporate misconduct database, shows that JPMorgan has paid nearly $40 billion since 2000 to resolve 277 enforcement actions and lawsuits involving toxic securities abuses, banking violations, investor protection violations and other offenses.
The New York-based bank made $49.6 billion in net income last year.

Six Coinbase customers claim the exchange is violating securities laws in new lawsuit

Six Coinbase customers filed a new class-action lawsuit against crypto exchange Coinbase Global, two subsidiaries — Coinbase, Inc. and Coinbase Asset Management, LLC. — and its CEO, Brian Armstrong, on May 5.The lawsuit alleges that the digital assets listed on Coinbase are securities. This includes Solana (SOL), Polygon (MATIC), Near Protocol (NEAR), Decentraland (MANA), Algorand (ALGO), Uniswap (UNI), Tezos (XTZ), and Stellar (XLM). The plaintiffs argue that these tokens constitute ‘investment contracts,’ subject to state securities laws.Coinbase itself admits to being a “Securities Broker” in its user agreement, according to the lawsuit. Therefore, the defendants “knowingly, intentionally, and repeatedly violated state securities laws” and deceived its users, the lawsuit filed with the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California, San Francisco Division alleges.The lawsuit further notes:“Its (Coinbase’s) entire business model has been built upon a lie and a dream: the lie is that “we do not sell securities,” and the dream is that, knowing it would eventually be caught in the lie, “it is better to ask for forgiveness than permission.”The lawsuit was filed by plaintiffs Gerardo Aceves, Thomas Fan, Edwin Martinez, Tiffany Smoot, Edouard Cordi and Brett Maggard from California and Florida. The plaintiffs are seeking full recission, meaning a cancellation of their purchase agreements, along with statutory damages under state law and injunctive relief.Coinbase has already been battling a lawsuit by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) which alleges the exchange violated securities laws. Coinbase argues that secondary sale of crypto assets do not constitute securities. The exchange filed an interlocutory appeal after a judge allowed the SEC lawsuit to proceed.Late last month, pro-XRP lawyer John Deaton filed an amicus brief in support of a motion for interlocutory appeal on behalf of 4,701 Coinbase customers. Deaton is currently running an election campaign against Senator Elizabeth Warren.Earlier this week, Coinbase reported a surge in its Q1 revenue, which surged past expectations to $1.64 billion. The exchange’s transaction revenue nearly tripled to $1.07 billion, with consumer transaction revenue alone soaring to $935 million, marking a doubling compared to the previous year.Mentioned in this article

The cryptocurrency community is abuzz with anticipation as fintech giant Ripple teases progress on its much-awaited stablecoin. This development marks a significant milestone for Ripple and the XRP Ledger ecosystem.At the recent XRP Las Vegas conference, Ripple CTO David Schwartz presented everything about XRP Ledger, including AMM, lending protocol, the future Ripple stablecoin, AI and crypto.The XRP community listened intently to the Ripple CTO's remarks, drawing a few deductions from his presentation at the conference.One of the takeaways that was shared by some XRP community members was that further details on Ripple's stablecoin will be disclosed in roughly a month during the XRPL Apex event in Amsterdam, which is slated for June 11-13. While Ripple is yet to disclose detailed information regarding its stablecoin project, the mere mention of development in this area has sparked interest among XRP holders and the wider cryptocurrency community.Another takeaway from the Ripple CTO's speech is that the Ripple stablecoin is ideal for institutions that cannot yet employ digital assets but want to use XRP Ledger. This was echoed by Vet, an XRPL dUNL validator, who highlighted the vast potential use cases of the latest XLS-68D Sponsor specification in this regard.The proposed stablecoin by Ripple is supposed to be 100% backed by U.S. dollar deposits, short-term U.S. government treasuries and other cash equivalents.Ripple's stablecoin is expected to be a game changer for the XRP Ledger ecosystem. Ripple hopes to increase adoption and growth within the XRPL ecosystem by exploiting the platform's native features, which include a decentralized exchange and an automated market maker.The stablecoin will be a key entry point into new prospects for institutional and decentralized finance (DeFi) application cases across many ecosystems.

Employee at Billion-Dollar Bank Arrested, Accused of Stealing $44,000 From Account of Deceased Customer - The Daily Hodl


								An employee at a billion-dollar bank has reportedly been arrested and accused of stealing money from the account of a deceased customer.
Latia Wynn of Wilmington, Delaware, was arrested by police for allegedly withdrawing $44,000 from a deceased customer’s account at WSFS Bank, NBC affiliate Philadelphia10 reports.










When one of its customers passed away in a motor vehicle accident, their family reportedly began closing all of their accounts – but noticed a lot of money was missing.
After officers were dispatched to the family of the victim, investigators were led to Wynn, who was later identified as a suspect and is now charged with one felony count of identity theft, one felony count of wearing a disguise during the commission of a felony, and one felony count of theft of $1,500 or greater.
The 25 year-old has been formally charged and released on an $18,000 unsecured bail.
As of March 31, 2024, WSFS Financial Corporation had $20.6 billion in assets and $80.5 billion in assets under management and administration.
In a similar case, the US Attorney’s Office for the District of New Jersey recently said bank employee Jorge Nova has pleaded guilty to a count of wire fraud and faces a 30 year prison sentence for draining $105,000 from a deceased customer’s account.
Nova was working at an unnamed commercial bank in Nutley, New Jersey when he came across a deceased customer’s account that had continued to collect Social Security benefits by direct deposit.
The retiree, who was receiving $2,372 per month in benefits, passed away on August 29th, 2014 – but the Social Security Administration (SSA) was not notified of the person’s death.
Consequently, the beneficiary’s account continued to receive funds from the SSA for more than four years.

Bitcoin’s Downturn Impacts Hong Kong’s ETF Market Coin Edition


							

Hong Kong’s ETFs witnessed low trading volumes in the initial four trading days.
The Bitcoin ETFs marked $5.5 million in trading volume on Friday, much lower than the first day.
Bitcoin’s bearish track significantly impacts Hong Kong’s failure to attract investors to the ETF market.




Recent reports revealed that Hong Kong’s recently launched Bitcoin ETFs marked comparatively lower trading volumes in the first four days. Amidst declining Bitcoin price, the Bitcoin exchange-traded funds failed to attract investors and traders.









Reinforcing its vision of establishing a crypto hub, Hong Kong launched Bitcoin and Ether ETFs on April 30, following the Securities and Futures Commission’s (SFC) green light. In total, asset managers China Asset Management, Harvest Global, Bosera, and HashKey launched 6 Bitcoin and Ether ETFs.



In a previous interview, ChinaAMC executive Zhu Haokang posited that the initial listing scale of Hog Kong’s ETFs would exceed the initial day’s scale of US ETFs. He remained confident of the ETFs as he asserted, “The details will be revealed to everyone at 9:30 tomorrow morning.”



Contrary to Haokang’s words, on the initial day, the ETFs recorded a total trading volume of 87.58 million Hong Kong Dollars, equivalent to $12 million. The figure marked a severe low from the first-day trading volume of US spot Bitcoin ETFs, valued at $4.6 billion. However, Bloomberg’s ETF analyst Eric Balchunas asserted that considering the size of Hong Kong’s crypto market compared to that of the US, the volume doesn’t mark Hong Kong’s failure.



The trading volume declined substantially in the following days, with Bitcoin ETFs witnessing a $5.5 million trading volume on Friday. Reports state that the prevailing bear market and the falling BTC price, which lost nearly a tenth of its value in the past month, remain a significant barrier to the success of Hong Kong’s ETFs.



At present, Bitcoin is trading at $63,331, with a slight surge of 0.15% in the last day. The pioneer cryptocurrency even witnessed the $56k mark at the onset of May. Over the past week, Bitcoin has shown a decline of 0.96% and a dip of 5.33% over the past month.

Rated: Week's top 3 new cryptocurrencies with the largest trading volume


Amidst the crypto market’s recovery from the downturn in early May, there remains an influx of new projects.  Some of the projects are attracting investor interest in specific metrics as they move to take a share of the market. 
In this regard, Finbold has identified a selection of top new cryptocurrencies with substantial trading volume based on data retrieved from CoinMarketCap. 
Top 3 cryptocurrencies with the highest trading volume. Source: CoinMarketCap
Friend.tech (FRIEND)
Friend.tech (FRIEND), the decentralized social network launched in August 2023, leads with a trading volume of $66.73 million. Despite this impressive figure, the platform initially faced significant setbacks as its native token experienced a drastic 98% drop in value at one point.


Upon its introduction to the market, the FRIEND token debuted at $169, attracting 18,000 holders. However, recent developments have raised concerns among investors participating in the airdrop.
Some users reported issues with app functionality and encountered difficulties in claiming their airdrop. Moreover, the distribution process was criticized for purportedly favoring leading creators over retail investors.
To address these challenges, a leaked smart contract revealed plans to launch non-transferable v2 tokens called POINTS. These tokens aim to stabilize the market price by imposing a 1.5% transfer fee.
Meanwhile, by press time, FRIEND was trading at $2.98, reflecting a 24-hour gain of 87%.

RSIC•GENESIS•RUNE (RSIC)
RSIC•GENESIS•RUNE (RSIC), built on the Runes protocol, represents the first pre-Rune airdrop for early Bitcoin (BTC) Ordinals adopters. With a trading volume of $12.54 million, RSIC ranks second.
The platform provides individuals with an opportunity to engage with Bitcoin and contribute to a more decentralized future.
Notably, attention to the token can be attributed to a move by crypto exchange OKX, which announced the addition of RSIC on OKX Jumpstart, featuring a staking pool of 367.50 million tokens. In celebration of this addition, eligible users who stake BTC via OKX Jumpstart Mining can mine RSIC•GENESIS•RUNE as rewards.
By press time, RSIC was trading at $0.01461, with daily losses exceeding 1%.

Kamino Finance (KMNO)
Kamino Finance (KMNO), Solana’s (SOL) largest lending and liquidity protocol, emerged third with a trading volume of $10.66 million. Notably, the token, which debuted on April 30 and initially traded at $0.11, experienced heightened volatility, leading to a significant drop in value.
Despite facing initial challenges, Kamino Finance witnessed a significant 64% surge in price in just one day, attributed to a move by Bybit announcing a 3,750,000 KMNO Airdrop available in Bybit’s Kamino campaign.

It’s worth noting that Kamino Finance distinguishes itself by tokenizing users’ positions into LP tokens dubbed kTokens, which can be used as collateral in Kamino Lend. This feature adds composability to the protocol, enabling tokens to move between protocols via Kamino’s liquidity vaults.
At the moment, KMNO is trading at $0.077 with daily losses of almost 2%.

In essence, these highlighted cryptocurrencies will depend heavily on the overall trading activity within the crypto sector to maintain any market dominance. Importantly, investor interest is likely to be bolstered by the tokens’ ability to demonstrate robust fundamentals.

Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong Says Layer-2 Solutions Will Drive Many Use Cases in Crypto Economy - The Daily Hodl


								The CEO of US-based crypto exchange Coinbase is optimistic that layer-2 scaling solutions will transform the crypto economy.
Speaking at Coinbase’s first-quarter earnings call, Brian Armstrong says he sees layer-2 scaling solutions facilitating the explosion of crypto use cases with lower fees and faster transaction times.










“As a reminder, layer 2 solutions help blockchains scale, similar to when the Internet moved from dial-up to broadband. And we believe this scaling will drive many new use cases in the crypto economy.”
The CEO goes on to put the spotlight on Base, Coinbase’s Ethereum (ETH) layer-2 designed to onboard billions of users into web3.
“Base has helped dramatically reduce transaction fees and confirmation times, getting us closer to our goal of having the average crypto transaction take less than one second and cost less than $0.01 anywhere in the world.
Developer activity on Base increased eightfold in Q1. In the last 30 days, Base has processed over 2x as many transactions as the entire Ethereum network on layer 1. 
We’ve made Base faster and cheaper to use with fee reduction by about 80% through protocol upgrades, and our fees are now often below $0.01.”
As for Bitcoin (BTC), Armstrong says the spot market exchange-traded funds have helped re-energize the entire crypto market.
“I think the ETFs got a lot of attention. But what we’re seeing is that when there’s attention on crypto in general, I think it creates energy and interest across all kinds of products in the industry.”

This Week in Crypto Games: Supercell's Investment, Saga Airdrop, 'Parallel' Adds Expansion - Decrypt

The crypto and NFT gaming space is busier than ever lately, what with prominent games starting to release, token airdrops piling up, and a seemingly constant array of other things happening at all times. It’s a lot to take in!Luckily, Decrypt’s GG is all over it.

This Week on Crypto Twitter: Ethereum, CZ, and Roger Ver in US Government Crosshairs - Decrypt

We do the research, you get the alpha!Get exclusive reports and access to key insights on airdrops, NFTs, and more! Subscribe now to Alpha Reports and up your game!Go to Alpha ReportsIllustration by Mitchell Preffer for DecryptCrypto Twitter often delivers a heavy helping of the law, but the past seven days brought a double dose. On Monday, unredacted portions of a lawsuit filed by Ethereum software company Consensys against the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) revealed that the regulator has secretly considered ETH to be a security for over a year. The bombshell news quickly sparked anger and indignation, given the fact that SEC Chair Gary Gensler has repeatedly refused to comment publicly on his agency’s view of ETH in the intervening period. Even prominent American lawmakers waded into the debate. Rep. Patrick McHenry (R-NC), chair of the House Financial Services Committee, posted a stern statement on Twitter on Tuesday, accusing Gensler of having lied when he testified before Congress about ETH’s regulatory status without revealing the SEC’s internal, pre-existing determination on the subject. Shifting from the U.S. House to a federal courthouse, Binance founder Changpeng “CZ” Zhao was sentenced to four months in U.S. federal prison that same day. Zhao pleaded guilty to money laundering violations last year. While it was certainly significant to see yet another founder of a major crypto exchange sent behind bars, the punishment was far less harsh than the three years prosecutors were hoping for. Indeed, the prevailing sentiment on Twitter following the sentencing hearing was fairly lighthearted, with many joking that Zhao had predicted his own sentencing given his famed use of the number “4” as a signal to dismiss cynical deployments of “fear, uncertainty, and doubt,” or FUD.Zhao himself took to Twitter shortly after the sentencing hearing to share his plans for life after prison and assert that he accepted the outcome of the trial, writing, “I will do my time.”If that wasn’t enough criminal crypto news for one day, only hours later the U.S. Department of Justice announced that it charged Roger Ver, an early Bitcoin investor known in some circles as “Bitcoin Jesus,” with evading nearly $50 million worth of taxes. Ver was arrested by authorities in Spain on Tuesday. Many on Twitter decried the arrest as an unjust anti-crypto provocation, given the fact that Ver renounced his U.S. citizenship in 2014. Others signaled their indifference to Ver’s plight, validating his status as a controversial personality in the crypto ecosystem.Some people found a way to reconcile both perspectives. Edited by Ryan Ozawa.Stay on top of crypto news, get daily updates in your inbox.

Bitcoin Ordinals Size Record Broken Again-How Much Bigger Can They Get? - Decrypt

Bitcoin Ordinals and Runes platform OrdinalsBot has created the largest Ordinals inscription to date, weighing in at a hefty 3.969 megabytes. Inscription number 70,614,708, the OrdinalsBot team announced Friday, contains a copy of “A Declaration of Independence in Cyberspace” by Logos Network.OrdinalsBot co-founder Brian Laughlan told Decrypt that the size of the inscription had less to do with the length of the document, and more to do with publishing the document as an image that would be large enough to read.“It's really interesting because the actual text content, if you build that out, would be like two kilobytes,” Laughlan said. “It’s tiny, but what they did was add an image and blew up the image to be that size—just to get that top spot and really make a statement.”It's not the first time in recent months that we've seen the Bitcoin Ordinals inscription size record broken, but the increases lately have been relatively minuscule—and there isn't much more room to grow, given the limitations of the Bitcoin blockchain. In this case, the new record inscription was a mere 0.001MB larger than the previous record-holder from March.The storage capacity on the Bitcoin blockchain was massively upgraded in 2017, Laughlan explained. The Segregated Witness (SegWit) update pushed past the prior 1 megabyte maximum size of a Bitcoin block to 4MB. Attempts to inscribe anything larger will fail.“Part of our job is making sure we don't do that,” Laughlan said. “What we'll do essentially is we'll craft [the Ordinal] locally, send it to our local Bitcoin nodes, and see if it all goes through—but we won't even look at it if it's over 4MB. There’s no point because we know its going to fail.”Following the launch of the Ordinals protocol in January 2023, OrdinalsBot came online as a way for Bitcoin enthusiasts to capitalize on the new craze with an easy-to-use interface. This March, the OrdinalsBot platform was used to inscribe music Ordinals for rapper French Montana, followed by another music NFT by Wu-Tang Klan’s Ghostface Killah in April.For large inscription projects like the Logos Network Declaration and the 3.968MB Runestone inscription from March, OrdinalsBot worked with Bitcoin mining company Marathon Digital to add larger amounts of data to a single Bitcoin blockchain block. In this case, the total block came in at 3.99MB, nearly all of which was taken up by the Logos inscription.“Our engineers and the engineers at Marathon are some of the best Bitcoin developers in the world,” OrdinalsBot co-founder Toby Lewis said. “Watching them work, especially when it's going for the largest block, you feel like history has been made every time."“They're testing the parameters [and] fine-tuning stuff," Lewis added, "because they don't actually know what will work. But from testnet to production is a really exciting moment."Boasting over 200,000 users on its platform, OrdinalsBot claims it played a part in creating eight out of the top 10 largest files ever inscribed on Bitcoin, including the aforementioned Runestone, the Ordz Games inscription for the BitBoy One game console, and Inscribed Pepes.OrdinalsBot also provides backend support for Magic Eden’s inscription services. In April, OrdinalsBot launched the Trio Ordinals utility token using the BRC-20 Bitcoin token standard.Edited by Ryan Ozawa and Andrew HaywardStay on top of crypto news, get daily updates in your inbox.

Crypto's Resurgence: New Narratives, Same Risks, Says Molly White | Cryptoglobe


                                
As Molly White, a prominent blockchain and cryptocurrency critic, points out in her recent Bloomberg article, the crypto market has once again entered a period of speculative mania after more than a year of a deep crypto winter. Bitcoin prices have surged, venture capital firms are investing in cryptocurrency startups, and the infamous crypto bros are back, mocking skeptics with their “have fun staying poor” mantra. However, as White astutely observes, this resurgence comes with a veneer of normalcy and a reputational makeover that may not reflect the true nature of the industry.



According to White, the crypto market remains fraught with manipulation and scams despite the new spokespeople in suits focusing on regulatory compliance and the traditional financial institutions pitching cryptocurrencies as a way to diversify portfolios. The approval of spot Bitcoin exchange-traded products (ETPs) by the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has been seen as a watershed moment by crypto advocates, but as White points out, even SEC Chair Gary Gensler has reiterated that Bitcoin is primarily a speculative and volatile asset with ties to illicit activities.



White’s article alleges that there is still rampant market manipulation on crypto exchanges, with wash trading being a built-in feature and a relatively small number of large holders artificially propping up prices. Despite the industry’s push to present crypto as a legitimate new asset class, White argues that greater reforms and more stringent enforcement are necessary to protect investors.



One of the key points White makes is that crypto relies heavily on storytelling, as the underlying technology lacks practical applications for the average person’s daily life. The narratives surrounding crypto have shifted over the years, from Bitcoin being pitched as a stable alternative to traditional banking to the “web3” buzzword of the last crypto boom. Now, as White observes, the industry is latching onto the AI trend, with startups promising to use blockchains alongside AI models to address various issues despite blockchain systems’ inherent inefficiencies and limitations.







            
            

            
            

            
            

        

White also calls attention to the concerning trend of AI pioneers like OpenAI CEO Sam Altman also being involved in blockchain projects, such as the Worldcoin token, which has drawn the ire of data privacy agencies in multiple countries. The world of AI-blockchain hybrids, as White points out, remains light on products and heavy on speculation, much like the worst offenders of the web3 era.



As the specter of a new crypto mania looms, White argues that it is far past time to consider new solutions to the familiar downside. She says the industry’s scammers must no longer be allowed to exploit everyday people drawn in by promises of revolutionary technology. White acknowledges the concerns of some crypto skeptics who worry that regulation may leave loopholes for exploitation while legitimizing crypto, but she asserts that the past decade of regulators largely ignoring the industry has not worked.



White concludes by emphasizing the need for thoughtful, carefully crafted regulation to protect investors and limit the contagion any future crypto disasters can transmit to the rest of the financial world. She also calls upon industry leaders to hold one another accountable and support models of government regulation that require rigorous outside scrutiny.

Shiba Inu and Dogecoin Rival Crazy Wolf (CRAWOLF) to Surge 7,000% Within 48 Hours



                    

Crazy Wolf (CRAWOLF) could become a viral memecoin, like Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE).



Crazy Wolf (CRAWOLF), a Solana memecoin that was launched this week, is aiming to challenge other memecoin giants, such as Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE).




Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Crazy Wolf presents a similar opportunity.



The exciting memecoin is poised to rally 7,300% in the coming two days, and Crazy Wolf could potentially reach a multi-million dollar market cap within a few weeks.



Currently, Crazy Wolf can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jupiter and Raydium, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days.




To buy Crazy Wolf on these platforms, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Crazy Wolf by entering its contract address – 4cra6VGCDowfFz3HDz5ctXtCSAhQQ5FEscKMLGzB56ML – in the receiving field.



In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price.



If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner.



The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum.




This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like CRAWOLF.

Crypto Analyst Forecasts First Billion Users by 2025, Chart Reveals Path to Mainstream Adoption



                    

Cryptocurrency analyst Willy Woo predicts that the cryptocurrency industry could hit its inaugural billion-user mark by the conclusion of 2025. 



Woo conveyed his insights in an April 29 X post, stating, “On track for 1 BILLION crypto users by the end of 2025. 




An extrapolation of many independent prior studies in this chart. Binance estimates that 65% of crypto users hold Bitcoin.”



The chart presented by Woo marks a significant advancement, offering a comprehensive model aimed at delineating existing crypto asset users and forecasting the initial billion adopters. 



Daniel Batten, an investor and author of the Bitcoin ESG Forecast, lauded the chart’s significance, remarking in an X reply to Woo, “Incredible chart. 




The first view we’ve had of when we’ll cross the 1B threshold, with a full backtrace.”



The criteria for defining crypto users in the chart are unique entities that have completed Know Your Customer (KYC) verification and have previously engaged in blockchain transactions.



Attaining the milestone of the first billion crypto users has long been regarded as a pivotal moment for mainstream adoption.

Mainstream adopters have the potential to inject fresh capital into the ecosystem, a factor crucial for the appreciation of digital assets.



The trajectory towards 1 billion crypto users is underscored by substantial growth in ownership. 



According to a January 2024 report by Crypto.com, the number of cryptocurrency owners surged by 34% to 580 million in 2023. 



Bitcoin holders, constituting 51% of global crypto holders, swelled by 33%, from 222 million in January to 296 million by December 2023. 



The report attributes this growth primarily to developments surrounding Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs).



Despite these strides, achieving the coveted billion-user mark by 2025 appears challenging, given the need for a 72% increase from the current 580 million users, based on 2023’s growth trajectory.



A joint 2022 report by Boston Consulting Group, Bitget, and Foresight Ventures forecasts reaching the billion-user milestone by 2030. 



Drawing parallels with the internet’s adoption curve, the report suggests that sustained crypto adoption could emulate a similar trajectory. 



Currently, crypto adoption remains relatively low, with ample room for expansion, as only 0.3% of individual wealth is invested in crypto compared to 25% in global equities, as estimated by BCG.

Shiba Inu Owners, Beware: Impersonators Are Targeting Your Pack!


								The booming Shiba Inu (SHIB) community faces a growing threat: imposters posing as prominent developers on social media platforms like Telegram. Shibarmy Scam Alerts, a watchful community group, recently exposed this deceptive tactic, urging investors to exercise caution in the face of these digital wolves in sheep’s clothing.

Shiba Inu Developers Targeted: Kusama And Dhairya In The Crosshairs
Shibarmy Scam Alerts identified fake Telegram accounts masquerading as Shytoshi Kusama and Kaal Dhairya, two leading figures within the Shiba Inu ecosystem. The imposters meticulously crafted usernames that mimicked the real developers, with subtle alterations designed to bypass casual scrutiny. This highlights the sophistication of these scams, emphasizing the need for investors to be meticulous when verifying online identities.


Beyond Names: The Devious Depths Of Deception
The implications of these impersonations extend far beyond stolen usernames. Scammers leverage this facade to gain victims’ trust, potentially tricking them into surrendering sensitive information or even transferring their SHIB holdings. Shibarmy Scam Alerts warns that these bad actors may attempt to solicit private keys, seed phrases, or other crucial details that grant access to crypto wallets.
To combat this evolving threat, the Shiba Inu community is emphasizing the importance of information hygiene. Investors are urged to rely solely on verified sources for official updates and announcements. The Shiba Inu development team will never request personal information or wallet access through unsolicited channels.

SHIB market cap currently at $14.5 billion. Chart: TradingView.com
Lessons From The Past: Shibarium Giveaway Scam A Stark Reminder
This recent incident isn’t the first time the Shiba Inu community has grappled with deception. In 2023, a fake Telegram account impersonating Kusama promoted a fabricated Shibarium giveaway following the network’s version 2.0 launch. This serves as a stark reminder of the lengths scammers will go to exploit community excitement and enthusiasm.

As the Shiba Inu phenomenon continues to attract new investors, the community recognizes the growing vulnerability to scams. Groups like Shibarmy Scam Alerts empower individuals to identify and report fraudulent activity. By fostering a culture of awareness and vigilance, the community can collectively safeguard the integrity of the Shiba Inu ecosystem.
Being Aware Of Red Flags
While Shibarmy Scam Alerts plays a crucial role, individual responsibility remains paramount. Investors are encouraged to educate themselves on red flags associated with crypto scams. This includes being wary of unrealistic promises, unsolicited investment advice, and pressure tactics. Additionally, leveraging two-factor authentication and strong passwords for online accounts adds another layer of security.

Bitcoin or Gold? We asked ChatGPT which asset is a better buy for summer 2024


As summer 2024 approaches, investors are closely evaluating which asset–Bitcoin (BTC) or gold holds more promise.
With their divergent roles in investment portfolios, Bitcoin as a growing digital asset and gold as a traditional safeguard against economic shifts, Finbold sought insights from ChatGPT, OpenAI‘s advanced AI model, to determine which might excel in the coming months.
Amid a landscape riddled with economic and geopolitical uncertainties, the debate between Bitcoin and gold becomes increasingly relevant. Each asset offers distinct advantages: Bitcoin presents high growth potential, while gold is viewed as a stable hedge against inflation and volatility.


While both assets have historically been compared, their paths in 2024 have significantly diverged. Gold has surged amid rising global concerns, demonstrating its strength as a dependable asset during turbulent times
Conversely, Bitcoin has experienced more volatility; notably, its price took a hit during the Israel-Iran conflict, overshadowing positive sentiments from recent cryptocurrency halvings.
Despite reaching record highs earlier in the year, Bitcoin’s value plummeted to around $57,000 by May, marking a critical support level. Meanwhile, gold closed April at an all-time high, reinforcing its status as a robust investment option.
This contrast underscores the divergent paths and potential of each asset as investors weigh their options for the summer of 2024.
ChatGPT’s analysis: Bitcoin vs. Gold investment prospects
According to ChatGPT, the decision largely depends on individual investment strategies and risk tolerance. For those seeking higher growth potential and are comfortable with volatility, Bitcoin might be the preferable option.

Conversely, for those seeking stability and lower risk, gold might be the preferred choice.

Including both assets in a diversified portfolio could also be a wise approach to balance potential risks and rewards.

As of 2024, the year-to-date performance for Bitcoin and gold presents a clear contrast in investment returns. Bitcoin has seen a significant rise, with a YTD increase of 52%, showcasing its volatile yet high-growth nature. The current price of Bitcoin stands at approximately $64,342. 
On the other hand, gold, known for its stability and role as a safe haven asset, has gained 11.5% YTD, with its current price at about $2,301 per ounce.
This performance highlights the divergent characteristics and investor appeal between the two assets: Bitcoin attracts those seeking rapid growth and high returns, albeit at higher risk, while gold appeals to investors looking for a more stable and secure investment amidst economic fluctuations.

Crypto Rich vs. Lottery Winners: Bloomberg Explains How Spending Habits Differ | Cryptoglobe


                                
The rise of cryptocurrencies has not only created a new asset class but has also given birth to a new generation of wealthy individuals. As reported by Bloomberg News, a group of researchers has delved into the fascinating world of crypto wealth and its impact on the US economy. Their findings shed light on how the so-called “crypto rich” are spending their newfound fortunes and the ripple effects this has on various sectors, particularly the housing market.



According to the Bloomberg article, the researchers found that crypto gains have led to a significant increase in household consumption. Over the past decade, this extra spending amounted to approximately $30 billion. Interestingly, for every dollar of unrealized crypto gains, households spent about nine cents. While this may seem like a small figure, it’s nearly double the marginal propensity to consume compared to stock market returns, as noted by Bloomberg.



However, the spending habits of crypto winners differ from those of lottery winners. The researchers discovered that household spending from crypto gains more closely resembles the patterns seen in traditional equity investments rather than the splurges associated with sudden windfalls like lottery winnings, as reported by Bloomberg.



One of the most intriguing findings from the research, as mentioned by Bloomberg, is the impact of crypto wealth on local housing markets. The researchers found that a significant portion of crypto gains were channeled into real estate, particularly in regions where cryptocurrencies are popular, such as parts of California, Nevada, and Utah.







            
            

            
            

            
            

        

To quantify this effect, the researchers looked at the crypto boom of 2017, when Bitcoin’s price skyrocketed by nearly 1,400%. By comparing home prices in counties with high crypto wealth to those with less enthusiasm for digital assets, they discovered that home prices in crypto-wealthy counties grew 43 basis points faster. This translated to a median house price increase of about $2,000 over 12 months, as reported by Bloomberg.



Furthermore, the researchers analyzed the impact of crypto wealth on home prices over the decade leading up to 2023. Bloomberg reports that for every dollar gained in households’ crypto wealth, the median home price increased by 15 cents over the following three months.



The Bloomberg article also highlights an interesting trend observed by the researchers when analyzing investors who withdrew at least $5,000 from their crypto brokerages between 2018 and 2023. These individuals increased their total spending by around $5,754 in the year following a large withdrawal compared to the previous year.



Notably, while mortgage spending remained constant in the six months prior to large withdrawals, it rose significantly after the event. Bloomberg says that for every household that withdrew $5,000 from their crypto exchange account, one in 20 purchased a house for the first time.

9 Celebrity Endorsements That Are Pushing Crypto Mainstream


																Grammy award-winning rapper Eminem recently cut an ad for Crypto.com to advertise blockchain to NBA fans. Here are 10 other celebrity endorsements that prove cryptocurrency adoption is accelerating.
But real quick first— here’s “The Real Slim Shady” singer’s X post with the Crypto.com advertisement:


“From the beginning you couldn’t stop, breaking resistance with every swing and block. Your game plan never changed.”
Bloomberg called the collaboration between a major crypto exchange, the hip-hop superstar, and the NBA a “sign of a dramatic shift in the crypto industry’s marketing and advertising efforts.”
Celebrity crypto endorsements are appearing again in commercial advertising six months after a jury in New York delivered a guilty verdict in the fraud case against the founder of failed crypto exchange FTX.
Here are 10 other celebrity endorsements over the years that show just how far mainstream adoption has come for cryptocurrency since Bitcoin mined its first block on Jan 3, 2009:
1. Elon Musk – Notorious Doge Father
To the inveterate engineer and CEO of SpaceX and Tesla, finance isn’t all that interesting. In May 2020, he told Joe Rogan that finance is just a matter of keeping track of money, but what we do with our resources to advance civilization is more interesting to him.
However, Musk recognizes the important innovations blockchain has produced in finance. In fact, he has been pumping Dogecoin since 2019, when he first posted on social media, “Dogecoin might be my fav cryptocurrency. It’s pretty cool.”
Styling himself the “Doge Father,” Musk has said regarding his vocal support for cryptocurrencies:
“I might pump, but I don’t dump.”
2. Lindsay Lohan – Dollar Inflation Hawk
In Feb. 2021, less than a year after Bitcoin’s third halving, “Parent Trap” and “Mean Girls” star Lindsay Lohan tweeted “Bitcoin To The Moon” with a rocket emoji.


Lohan’s endorsement was true to form. As early as 2011, Lindsay tweeted that she was concerned inflation is getting out of control.
“Have you guys seen food and gas prices lately? U.S. $ will soon be worthless if the Fed keeps printing money!” Lohan posted.
3. Maisie Williams – Arya Long Bitcoin?
In Nov. 2020, just six months after Bitcoin’s four-year supply cut, HBO “Game of Thrones” star Maisie Williams tweeted, “Should I go long on Bitcoin” in 2020?” with a poll.
Nearly a million Twitter users voted, and 53% said “No,” while 47% said “Yes.”


4. Snoop Dogg – Pumps Dogecoin
Around the time Lindsay Lohan shipped Bitcoin in Feb. 2021, RIAA gold and platinum selling hip hop artist Snoop Dogg pumped DOGE tokens on Twitter.
The “Gin and Juice” singer had his mind on his money when he posted a photoshop of one of his album covers depicting him as a Shiba Inu, with the caption: “Snoop Doge.”


The price of DOGE tokens surged to a new record high of $0.0844 following the tweet from Snoop Dogg and another by Elon Musk. KISS frontman Gene Simmons joined in with a tweet encouraging Dogecoin owners to “HODLE!”
5. Ashton Kutcher – Early Bitcoin Investor
“That 70’s Show” actress Mila Kunis repped Bitcoin on Stephen Colbert’s show in 2021. Kunis told Colbert that Kutcher, who played Steve Jobs in the indie biopic “Jobs,” got them investing in Bitcoin as early as 2013.
“He sat me down and was like, ‘Hey, babe, I got to explain this thing to you; tell me if I’m crazy.’ He’s like, ‘There’s this thing, it’s like mining for money. It’s called cryptocurrency. And there’s this company.’ This was eight-plus years ago— ‘It’s called Bitcoin,'” Kunis told Colbert.
“I was like, ‘Well, I think this is a horrible idea,’ she continued. “And he went, ‘Cool, we’re investing in it.’ So, he didn’t listen to me. I mean, this happens all the time.”
6. LeBron James – Cut an ad for Crypto.com in 2022
Los Angeles Lakers Power Forward LeBron James and the LeBron James Family Foundation signed a multi-year contract with Crypto.com in 2022. The all-time leading scorer in NBA history’s first advertisement for the Singapore-based crypto exchange featured James giving advice to his younger self.
In the ad, James from the Future said, “I can’t tell you everything, but if you want to make history, you’ve got to call your own shots.”
VIDEO
7. Mark Cuban – Endorsed Polygon and Injective
In January this year, ABC Network’s “Shark Tank” judge and Dallas Mavericks owner Mark Cuban highlighted Polygon (MATIC) and Injective (INJ) to his 8.8 million followers on X. He wrote, “I’ve invested in both (DYOR).”
Cuban’s answer to fans who asked him about crypto in the AMA-style interview on X reveals he’s bullish for Ethereum because Polygon is an Ethereum Layer-2 extending the base chain’s ecosystem, and Injective is an L1 crypto with an ERC20 bridge to Ethereum for multi-chain interoperability.
8. Kevin O’Leary – Once Crypto Skeptic, Now Bitcoin Bull
Canadian businessman Kevin O’Leary, one of the other judges on the hit ABC show about venture capitalism, was once a crypto skeptic who called Bitcoin “garbage” and a “useless currency.” Like the late Berkshire don Charlie Munger, O’Leary believed “there is nothing here except raw speculation.”
Today, he is not only a Bitcoin bull but also calls himself a Bitcoin “purist” who buys to hold “digital gold” for the long term.
O’Leary doesn’t even support Bitcoin ETFs because he thinks it’s better to custody your own on-chain BTC so you are the bearer of your private keys. Plus, he says it saves on paying those ETF issuers’ fees, so crypto investors can accumulate faster.
Although O’Leary did predict the Bitcoin ETFs in July 2022.
9. Joe Rogan – Hyperbitcoinization Theory
Comedian, UFC announcer, and podcast king Joe Rogan told OpenAI CEO Sam Altman in an episode of his show last October:
“The real fascinating crypto is Bitcoin. To me, that’s the one that I think has the most likely possibility of becoming a universal viable currency. It’s limited in the amount that there can be [and] people mine it with their own [computer]. That to me is very fascinating. I love the fact that it’s been implemented.”
Rogan has also brought Bitcoin evangelist Andreas Antonopoulos onto his show for four separate episodes over the years to explain blockchain technology and the significance of cryptocurrency in the modern economy.

Real Estate Is the New Luxury for Bitcoin Millionaires


The narrative that early Bitcoin investors indulged in extravagant luxuries like Lamborghinis is shifting. 
Recent research suggests crypto millionaires are now channeling their newfound wealth into real estate investments, indicating a more mature spending pattern.
Bitcoin Millionaires Are Maturing
According to a study involving researchers from esteemed institutions like Brigham Young, Northwestern, and Imperial College London, the increase in crypto wealth has notably influenced the American real estate market. 
Their analysis, presented to the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp., used data from 60 million people over 13 years. It revealed that approximately nine cents fueled household spending for every dollar of unrealized crypto gains.
While social media often glorifies lavish spending on luxury cars and jewelry, the actual economic impact of crypto wealth has been more nuanced. The study highlights a propensity among crypto millionaires to invest in housing. This is paralleling traditional equity investments rather than fleeting lottery winnings. 

“Our estimates suggest that household spending out of crypto gains aligns more with the patterns from traditional equity investments,” noted Darren Aiello, assistant professor of finance at BYU.

This trend was particularly evident in 2017 when Bitcoin surged from about $950 to $14,000. Researchers found that home prices rose significantly faster in areas with high levels of crypto engagement than in less crypto-centric locations. Specifically, homes in these crypto-wealthy counties appreciated by an additional 43 basis points over 12 months.
Moreover, a separate analysis of crypto brokerage withdrawals showed that substantial sums withdrawn led to increased spending on housing shortly thereafter. 


“For every household that withdrew $5,000 from their crypto exchange account, one in 20 bought a house for the first time,” Jason Kotter, another finance professor at BYU, shared.

The shift towards real estate investment among Bitcoin millionaires reflects a strategic approach to wealth management. It diverges from the stereotypical image of frivolous spending.

Binance Ban in Philippines Spurs Shift to Local Exchanges Amidst Higher Fees and Token Limitations



                    

Following Binance‘s expulsion from the Philippines, traders in the country now face increased trading fees and a reduced selection of crypto tokens, as indicated by a regional executive.



On December 14, 2023, the Philippines Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) initiated a three-month countdown to a Binance prohibition. 




Kelvin Lee of the SEC noted Binance’s failure to register in the Philippines and adhere to regulations.



The National Telecommunication Commission (NTC) instructed local internet service providers to block the exchange on March 25. 



Subsequently, on April 23, the SEC directed Apple and Google to remove the Binance app from their stores.




With the ban in full effect, Cointelegraph contacted local stakeholders to gauge the impact of the Binance ban on the Philippine crypto space.



Ethan Rose, CEO of Pouch, which facilitates Bitcoin payments in the Philippines, applauded the ban, citing former Binance CEO Changpeng Zhao’s involvement in serious financial crimes.

Rose emphasized the ban’s protective nature for Filipino traders.




Rose highlighted a shift of business to local exchanges due to the ban, predicting a positive effect on the local economy and global investment funding for Philippine crypto businesses.



However, Rose acknowledged the trade-offs, foreseeing higher trading fees and fewer token options for Filipino traders.



Arlone Polo Abello, CEO of Global Miranda Miner Group, characterized the SEC action as not a significant crackdown but a reflection of the US SEC’s registration requirements for exchanges like Binance. 



Abello noted Binance’s lack of communication with Filipino traders, which was apparent in their focus group discussions.



Jay Ricky Villarante, CEO of Moneybees, emphasized the importance of regulatory compliance in the crypto industry. 



He viewed the ban as a step towards regulatory clarity in the Philippine crypto market, fostering confidence and responsible innovation.



In summary, while acknowledging both positive and negative implications, Villarante deemed the ban a significant development for crypto in the Philippines.

Subsidiary of Kraken Becoming Under-the-Radar Beneficiary of Multi-Billion ETF Boom: Report - The Daily Hodl


								A subsidiary of US-based crypto exchange Kraken is reportedly greatly benefiting from the success of the spot Bitcoin (BTC) exchange-traded fund (ETF) boom.
According to a new report by Bloomberg, CF Benchmarks – a London-based subsidiary of Kraken that provides reference data for about $24 billion in crypto ETFs – is emerging as an under-the-radar beneficiary to the launch of the BTC ETFs.










A benchmark is a standard used for comparative purposes when assessing the performance of assets or a portfolio.
According to Bloomberg, CF Benchmarks licenses its benchmarks to Bitcoin ETF issuers including BlackRock in exchange for fees that increase as an issuer’s assets under management rise.
Spot market BTC ETFs were approved by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) in January and also debuted in Hong Kong within the last two weeks.
CF Benchmarks chief executive Sui Chung tells Bloomberg in an interview that he envisions BTC ETFs hitting Israel and South Korea after being approved by regulators in Hong Kong.
“South Korea is a market where ETFs have become the wrapper of choice for long-term savings. It is also a market where digital assets have gained a high degree of adoption.”
According to Bloomberg, CF Benchmarks expected $5 billion of assets from spot market BTC ETFs that utilize its indices but ended up with a figure four times larger than that.
Chung also tells Bloomberg he expects another $1 billion in assets to come under management for Hong Kong BTC ETFs by the end of the year.
Chung says that CF Benchmarks – which was acquired by Kraken in 2019 for a nine-figure sum – sees its revenue growing to the “mid-double digits” this year.
Bitcoin is trading for $63,433 at time of writing, a marginal increase on the day.

Bitcoin Sender Struck With Staggering $100,254 Transaction Fee For A Single Transfer ⋆ ZyCrypto


            
            
Advertisement

&nbsp

&nbsp
An unidentified Bitcoin user has just shelled out a transaction fee of 1.5 Bitcoin (BTC), equivalent to $100,254, based on the current market price. The exorbitant fee was brought to light on Saturday by Whale Alert, a popular service that tracks large cryptocurrency transactions. 







The fee is quite higher than the average transaction cost, resulting in wild speculation regarding the circumstances that might have led to such an expensive fee. This Bitcoin user paid this high fee to have their transaction included in an ordinary Bitcoin block.



Possible Reasons



Bitcoin transaction fees are dolled out to miners as part of their reward for verifying transactions and including them in new blocks added to Bitcoin’s blockchain. Normally, Bitcoin users can pay any amount they wish for transaction fees. If the transaction fee is too low, miners might not accept it, and if it’s outrageously high, miners are incentivized miners to process the transaction more quickly.



Average transaction fees are typically around $2 or $4 but rose to as high as $128 recently amid the quadrennial halving event and debut of Casey Rodarmor’s new Runes. This represented a record-level period in terms of fees, with a few costly, urgent transactions skewing the metric.



However, transaction fees have since stabilized, and the latest sky-high fee appears to be an individual error instead of a wider market impact. It could also be reasons known only to the sender or even related to money laundering.

&nbsp



Over its history, Bitcoin has witnessed several high-value transaction fees. For instance, in September 2023, a Bitcoin user paid 19 BTC (worth $510,000 at the time) for a BTC transfer.



Additionally, another BTC user paid over 4 BTC in January to have their transfer added to Bitcoin block 826,032. The transaction was, therefore, charged with an eye-watering 1,800,890 sat/vB fee.



Bitcoin was valued at $63,942 at press time, shedding a measly 0.3% over the last 24 hours.

Cardano founder proposes Bitcoin Cash integration in X poll

Cardano founder Charles Hoskinson recently posted a “hypothetical poll” on the X social media platform asking the crypto community if they’d be interested in seeing a Cardano and Bitcoin Cash integration. The poll received more than 12,000 votes in its first 24 hours with a 66.3% early majority voting “yes” to the proposal. Source: @IOHK_Charles on X. “Would you like to see Bitcoin Cash become a Cardano Partnerchain upgraded with Useful Proof of Work Leios, NiPoPoWs, and Ergo tech, thus being the fastest and most useful proof of work chain ever built?”As mentioned above, Hoskinson labelled his poll as being hypothetical. However, as Elon Musk has shown since his purchase of the X platform, formerly Twitter, it’s possible to use the platform as a steering point for decision making. Ben Scherrey, founder and CTO of blockchain firm Biggest Lab, posted commentary in favor of the move, stating that he’d “always thought there was some natural synergy between the two chains given the shared UTXO model that allows for high scalability and decentralization.”While the community appears to support the idea of a Bitcoin Cash and Cardano integration, how such a partnership would form and function is a bit murky.On the technology side, Hoskinson used the term “partnerchain.” This seems to imply Bitcoin Cash would have to be bridged or cross-chained in some form in order to operate with the proposed upgrades. Assuming both development teams could come to an accord on the technical aspects of the partnership, there would still need to be a consensus among stakeholders and developers. Hoskinson’s discourse on social media comes as Cardano prepares for two “major upgrades” this year. As Cointelegraph recently reported, the company is preparing for the “Chang” hardfork slated for sometime in the second quarter of 2024 as well a new proof-of-stake model called “Ouroboros Leios.” The pending upgrades were lauded by Hoskinson in his response to an April 7 video posted by crypto influencer Ben “Bitboy” Armstrong. In the video, Armstrong referred to Cardano as “dead” Related: Crypto veterans call out DOJ for targeting Roger Ver a decade after he left US

Ripple CTO hints at progress in developing XRP Ledger stablecoin

Ripple has suggested substantial developments within its new stablecoin, billed to revolutionize the XRP Ledger environment. The information surfaced at the XRP Las Vegas conference where Ripple’s Chief Technology Officer David Schwartz revealed upcoming integrations, including the stablecoin, with the XRP Ledger.Ripple CTO provides insights at XRP Las VegasDuring the XRP Las Vegas conference, David Schwartz, who is the CTO of Ripple, provided a detailed review of the capabilities of the XRP Ledger including both the features it already has and the developments planned in the near future. The focus of his presentation was on the proposed automated market maker (AMM), a new lending protocol, and the combination of artificial intelligence with blockchain technology. Nonetheless, the biggest news for many of those present was the news on the work on a stablecoin developed by Ripple.Schwartz noted that more information related to the stablecoin would be revealed at the XRPL Apex event that will gather in Amsterdam from June 11 to 13. This news has increased the excitement among XRP holders and the market as well, emphasizing Ripple’s determination to develop its blockchain ecosystem.Ripple’s stablecoin effectSeen as an innovative addition to the XRP Ledger, the proposed Ripple stablecoin seeks to be backed by 100% U.S. dollar deposits, short-term U.S. government security, and other cash equivalents. This stablecoin is intended to help institutions that have not fully adopted digital assets to move easily into the realm of cryptocurrencies and take advantage of the decentralized nature of the XRP Ledger.The crucial part of XRP’s strategy is to leverage the ledger’s native decentralized exchange and upcoming automated market maker in order to drive wider adoption as well as support new institutional and decentralized finance (DeFi) applications. In particular, Vet, a dUNL validator, highlighted the use cases the XLS-68D Sponsor specification allows, once again making it clear that the XRP Ledger is technically capable to support such advanced features.XRP’s stablecoin enhances XRP Ledger flexibilityThe stablecoin’s launch is in compliance with Ripple’s general strategy aimed at enhancing the usefulness and flexibility of the XRP Ledger. The provision of a stable and dependable digital currency option would see Ripple bring on board new institutional users and DeFi applications and in so doing, making the network more robust and attractive.This program is part of Ripple’s innovative initiative aimed at bringing cryptocurrency applications that push the limit of blockchain capabilities and practicality of cryptocurrency in real life. As the forthcoming XRL Apex conference in Amsterdam gains traction, not only the XRP users but also the potential investors watch Ripple’s actions, casting their eyes at the future prospects of the digital financial market that would be reshaped by this development.

Trump vs. Biden: Krugman Examines the "Are You Better Off" Debate | Cryptoglobe


                                
In a recent opinion piece for The New York Times, economist Paul Krugman revisits the question once posed by Ronald Reagan: “Are you better off than you were four years ago?” 



Krugman is a renowned American economist, a Nobel Prize laureate, and a prominent public intellectual. He’s known for his expertise in international trade and economic theory, his work as a columnist for The New York Times, and his progressive economic views. Krugman has a strong academic background, having taught at prestigious institutions like MIT and Princeton. He won the Nobel Prize in Economic Sciences in 2008 for his groundbreaking work on economic geography and trade patterns.pen_spark



Krugman uses the famous question to evaluate the current political discourse surrounding the potential return of Donald Trump, suggesting that an honest assessment would favor President Biden due to significant improvements since 2020.



Krugman says that four years ago, during Trump’s presidency, the U.S. grappled with the peak of the Covid-19 pandemic, witnessing massive loss of lives daily, skyrocketing unemployment with over 20 million Americans out of work, and a surge in violent crime. Fast forward to today, Krugman notes, the U.S. has enjoyed the longest stretch of sub-4% unemployment rates since the 1960s and a reduction in violent crime rates that spiked under Trump.







            
            

            
            

            
            

        

Krugman argues against giving Trump a pass for the crises of 2020, which some attribute solely to the pandemic. He suggests that if Trump is excused due to these extraordinary circumstances, Biden should similarly be given leeway for challenges occurring during his administration that might be aftermaths of the same disruptions. He points specifically to the inflation surge of 2021-2022, which paralleled economic patterns in Europe, indicating broader, global causes likely related to the pandemic’s effects.



Addressing Trump’s touted economic wins, such as the brief period of sub-$2 per gallon gas prices, Krugman criticizes these claims as fleeting and linked to the global economic downturn caused by the pandemic, rather than successful economic policy. He emphasizes that, by most measures, Americans are economically better off now than before the pandemic began, with real per capita incomes and wages generally increasing more than inflation.



Despite these economic gains under Biden, Krugman observes a mismatch between public economic sentiment and actual personal financial conditions, a phenomenon he attributes to the psychological impacts of inflation, where visible price increases might overshadow real wage gains.



Krugman concludes by reflecting on the allure of “Trump-stalgia,” a nostalgic and perhaps glossed-over remembrance of Trump’s presidency, overlooking the significant hardships of 2020. He suggests that while Biden has successfully navigated the nation to a state of lower unemployment, reduced inflation, and decreased crime rates, many Americans remain unaware of these improvements, influenced by a selective memory of past challenges.

Ripple's Brad Garlinghouse Talks XRP Before Stablecoin Launch


Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse clarified the status of XRP and Ethereum in the eyes of regulatory bodies. 
Amidst Ripple’s intense legal encounters with the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), Garlinghouse’s comments carry significant weight, especially with Ripple nearing the launch of its stablecoin.
Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse: XRP Is Not a Security, Stablecoin Coming
Garlinghouse, in a conversation with Michael Arrington of Arrington Capital, stated that neither XRP nor Ethereum are securities. This assertion is crucial as Ripple prepares to introduce a stablecoin, underscoring its stance in a complex regulatory environment.

“Anyone who thinks Ripple is not 100% behind XRP is just missing the point. They have lost the plot. We are totally committed and we will remain totally committed,” Garlinghouse said.

The ongoing debate regarding the classification of digital assets like XRP and Ethereum has seen various developments. Notably, a July 2023 court ruling partially relieved Ripple by declaring XRP not a security. Still, it pointed out that certain institutional sales of XRP were unregistered securities sales.

Meanwhile, Ethereum faces its challenges. Consensys recently sued the SEC, seeking a declaration to preempt any claims that Ethereum is an unregistered security.

As Ripple gears up for the next phase, the fintech giant is teasing advancements in its XRP Ledger ecosystem. At the same conference, Ripple CTO David Schwartz discussed the upcoming Ripple stablecoin alongside innovations in automated market makers (AMM) and lending protocols. 
The Ripple community is keenly awaiting further details, which are expected to be unveiled at the XRPL Apex event in Amsterdam.
The proposed Ripple stablecoin, backed by US dollar deposits and short-term US government treasuries, is tailored for institutions unable to utilize digital assets directly but eager to leverage the XRP Ledger. According to Vet, an XRPL dUNL validator, the stablecoin could revolutionize institutional and decentralized finance by utilizing the ledger’s decentralized exchange and automated market maker features.

Bitcoin Whales Gobble Over 47,000 BTC Worth $2,967,768,000 in Just 24 Hours Amid ‘New Era’: CryptoQuant CEO - The Daily Hodl


								The chief executive of blockchain intelligence platform CryptoQuant says that Bitcoin (BTC) whales have snapped up nearly $3 billion worth of the crypto king in just 24 hours.
CryptoQuant CEO Ki Young Ju tells his 345,000 followers on the social media platform X that the deep-pocketed investors have gobbled up tens of thousands of BTC in just one day, signaling the approach of a new era.










“Bitcoin whales accumulated 47,000 BTC in the past 24 hours. We’re entering a new era.”

To get these results, Ju used CryptoQuant search filters to find whales of the top crypto asset by market cap that hold at least 100 BTC, had a transaction within a 24-hour time frame and do not qualify as a centralized exchange (CEX) or miner wallet.
Ju goes on to note that the recent spike of whale activity surrounding Bitcoin is not related to BTC exchange-traded funds (ETFs), which were approved by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) in January.
Last month, Ju said that newer crypto whales – or investors that CryptoQuant defines as holding at least 1,000 Bitcoin with an average coin age of less than 155 days – have accumulated nearly twice as much BTC as their long-term holder counterparts.
Long-term holder whales hold at least 1,000 Bitcoin with an average coin age of 155 days or more
At the time, Ju said old BTC tokens were being transferred to new holders after Bitcoin’s average dormancy rate recently hit a 13-year peak.
Bitcoin is trading for $63,582 at time of writing, a 2.86% increase during the last 24 hours.

Bitcoin’s Bullish Reversal: Is $83,500 in Sight Before July? - Coin Edition


							

Bitcoin has soared 14% since the crash to $56.6K, reclaiming the $64K channel.
An analyst said $67.5K re-entry sets the path to new ATH in the $83.5K level.
Where the re-entry fails, a retest of $60K is expected before the rally to $83.5K by July.




Over the last 48 hours, the crypto market has been in a significant recovery mode, with the premier cryptocurrency, Bitcoin (BTC), reclaiming the $64K threshold. This bullish market emerged less than a week after Bitcoin collapsed to $56,500.



With Bitcoin’s intraday high of $64,500 at press time, the premier asset has rebounded by over 14.15% since the May 1 crash. Expectedly, the alternative cryptocurrencies have leveraged Bitcoin’s rebound to regain lost territories.









However, given that the market’s recovery has been ongoing for at least two days, prominent market watchers are examining how long the recovery could last before another bearish turn.



Among those commenting on the subject is Matthew Hyland, a widely followed Bitcoin analyst. In a recent post on X, Hyland suggested two possible scenarios that could play out. 



Initially, the analyst argued that Bitcoin reclaiming $67,500 in this bullish run would set the path for a more aggressive rally that would drive the asset’s price to unexplored price territories. More specifically, he sees Bitcoin establishing a new all-time high shortly after regaining $67.5K.



Meanwhile, in a follow-up post, he highlighted other events that could surface if Bitcoin fails to re-enter the $67,500 range. He presented a chart that foreshadows Bitcoin’s trajectory.



The graph suggested the market could witness a brief retracement to the $60,500 price level. However, this development is anticipated to catapult Bitcoin’s value to $71,500. Meanwhile, another retest of the $67K range is expected following the surge to $71,500. 





In Hyland’s view, this retest would aggressively push Bitcoin toward the $83,500 range, a price level the premier asset has never seen. Interestingly, Hyland expects these projections to materialize before July.



Other prominent market observers have conveyed similar optimism that Bitcoin is headed for the $80K range after the crash to $56K. At press time, BTC trades at around $63,870.

Doctor Pepe (DOCPEPE) Surges 225% in 5 Hours and Prepares for New 3,000% Rally, While Shiba Inu and Dogecoin Struggle



                    

Doctor Pepe (DOCPEPE), a newly launched Solana memecoin, has been attracting significant investment from early Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) buyers.



Doctor Pepe (DOCPEPE) has surged around 225% in the first few hours since its launch,  delivering huge returns for early investors and attracting investment from early Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) buyers.




However, DOCPEPE still has plenty of potential to rise more, and it’s poised to rally another 3,000% in the coming 48 hours.



Furthermore, it has already been announced that the token will soon be listed on MEXC – as its first listing on a centralized exchange – and this will be another massively bullish event for its price.



Despite the rally so far, DOCPEPE still just has a market cap of around $34,000, meaning it has immense potential for more gains in the coming days and weeks.




Currently, Doctor Pepe can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jupiter and Raydium, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days.



To buy DOCPEPE on these platforms, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for DOCPEPE by entering its contract address – 3n8HMVVfMF2uqdpts5TUETAHUrvD1AFg8V1XLahpeTT8 – in the receiving field.



Early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and Bonk (BONK) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price.



If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner.

Crypto Analyst Foresees Altcoin Boom Amid Economic Downturn: 'Altcoin Bull Market Has Started' - Benzinga

In the wake of dismal U.S. economic data, crypto analyst Michaël van de Poppe forecasted a substantial rally in the altcoin markets.What Happened: On Friday, van de Poppe communicated his optimistic stance on cryptocurrencies to his followers on the social media platform X.This comes in the wake of the U.S. labor market falling short of estimates in April, with unemployment climbing to 3.9% and average hourly earnings growing less than anticipated. Van de Poppe believes that these economic indicators will compel the Federal Reserve to activate the money printers to bolster the job market, leading to a rally in risk-on assets.Also Read: Amid Dogecoin Crash, 374 Million DOGE Moved From Robinhood To Unknown Wallet"Terrible economic data -> DXY (US dollar index) down. Additionally, the case for QE (quantitative easing) and rate cuts will increase, and therefore risk-on assets rally," he said. The analyst also foresees a consolidation period for the altcoin market before it rallies to record new all-time highs.He predicted the total altcoin market capitalization to stabilize in the $880-$920 billion range before a run toward an all-time high.Van de Poppe also expects the resurgence of retail traders in the crypto markets once altcoins register significant gains."Retail isn’t even in the markets, while Bitcoin is around the all-time highs. When will they come back? It will probably be after this summer when altcoins start to lift off," he said.Why It Matters: The recent downturn in the altcoin market has been attributed to supply and demand dynamics and a loss of momentum, as reported by pseudonymous crypto strategist Pentoshi.The frequent launch of new altcoins diluted demand, necessitating around $200 million a day in new money inflows to maintain current prices.Furthermore, cryptocurrency strategist Altcoin Sherpa recently predicted a 267% surge in the value of Solana SOL/USD by the end of the year. He suggested that buying shares of Solana at current levels could yield substantial future gains. These forecasts align with van de Poppe's predictions, indicating a potential boom in the altcoin market.Now Read: Crypto Markets Tumble Following Iran's Drone Attack Against Israel, Investor Warns Of Continued SelloffThis content was partially produced with the help of Benzinga Neuro and was reviewed and published by Benzinga editors.Photo: Shutterstock

Lido Finance Surpasses One Million Ethereum Validators, Cementing its DeFi Dominance



                    

Lido Finance, the premier decentralized finance (DeFi) protocol for liquid staking on Ethereum, has celebrated a significant milestone, reaching one million Ethereum validators. 



This achievement was announced through an April 29th post on X, underscoring Lido Finance’s position as a leader in the DeFi space.




Liquid staking protocols such as Lido Finance play a crucial role in democratizing staking for retail users with limited capital. 



Typically, individuals would require 32 Ether to operate their own validator nodes on Ethereum. 



However, Lido Finance offers an alternative avenue, making staking accessible to a broader audience.




According to data from Dune, Lido Finance commands a substantial portion, 28.5%, of staked Ether, with an additional 13.6% staked through the Coinbase exchange. 



Presently, over 27% of the entire Ether supply is engaged in staking activities.



The appeal of liquid staking protocols like Lido lies in the liquidity benefits they provide. 



Users who participate in staking through Lido receive Lido Staked ETH (stETH) in return, which can be utilized in various other DeFi protocols. 




This stands in contrast to traditional staking methods, where staked Ether remains locked and inaccessible for the duration of the staking period.

The rise of liquid staking is significantly contributing to the growth of DeFi. 



Total value locked (TVL) in DeFi protocols has experienced a substantial surge, reaching $97 billion in the first quarter of 2024 from a low of $36 billion in the fourth quarter of 2023. 



Current TVL stands at $92.32 billion, according to DefiLlama.



This growth, which saw a 65.6% increase quarter-on-quarter, can be primarily attributed to liquid staking protocols like Lido, as noted by on-chain intelligence provider Messari. 



The cumulative TVL amassed by liquid staking protocols exceeds $47.7 billion, with Lido alone accounting for over $29.9 billion.



Despite its success, concerns have been raised about Lido’s growing dominance within the ecosystem. Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin has previously expressed apprehensions regarding potential centralization risks associated with Lido. 



In a blog post dating back to September 2023, Buterin highlighted the need for vigilance against such risks, acknowledging the efforts made by protocols like Lido in implementing safeguards while cautioning that one layer of defense may not suffice.

BNB wishes to cross $600, but why the altcoin can drop to $550 instead - AMBCrypto



A bullish invalidation could cause BNB to drop to $561.
Funding Rate and sentiment were negative, suggesting a bearish bias.

Binance [BNB] might attempt to break out according to the 4-hour chart. But AMBCrypto’s analysis revealed that this effort could be in vain.
One of the reasons for this prediction is the Exponential Moving Average (EMA). This indicator measures trend direction over some time.
At press time, BNB changed hands at $586. But the 20 EMA (blue) and 50 EMA (yellow) were at the same spot. The EMA positions indicated hesitation by bulls and bears to direct the price action.
Hence, BNB might trade within a tight range unless a crossover happens.
Golden cross gone: Death cross next?
If the 20 EMA crosses over the 50 EMA, the price might extend toward $593. But that seemed unlikely as the next target for BNB could be $561 where the last golden cross happened.
For those unfamiliar, the golden cross is the terminology used to describe a situation when the 20 EMA crosses above the 50 EMA. If the 50 EMA rises above it, then it is termed a dearth cross.
Source: TradingView
Apart from the indicator above, another one that suggested a decline was the Money Flow Index (MFI).
This indicator uses the price and volume data to show if a cryptocurrency is experiencing buying pressure or otherwise.
At press time, the MFI had decreased to 66.04, indicating that the BNB’s buying volume had subsided. Should the reading continue to decline, the bearish thesis might be validated.
However, this AMBCrypto analysis was not the only one sharing this view. A look at on-chain data revealed that a large part of the market expects the price of BNB to decrease.
Bears double-down on wager
This was evident from the Weighted Sentiment, which was negative at press time. This negative value shows that most comments about BNB on social platforms were bearish.
As long as this remains the same, it could be challenging for the price to jump. On the other hand, if remarks about BNB begin to get optimistic, the trend might change.
Furthermore, a look at the Funding Rate showed that it was on the extreme side of the negative area. The Funding Rate meant more traders leaned toward short positions.
Source: Santiment
If funding was positive, it would have implied that traders were bullish on the coin. In addition, funding also has an impact on the price. From the press time status, BNB’s price moved lower while funding was negative.

The reasonable inference here is that perp sellers are aggressive, and were getting rewards for their positions.
In a case like this, BNB might fade a bullish move, and a possible decline could be next unless spot buyers save the day.

Consensys Lawsuit Unveils SEC's Belief in Ether as Potential Security



                    

Consensys’ legal battle with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has brought to light significant revelations regarding the SEC’s position on Ether.



According to a report by Fox Business producer Eleanor Terret, the SEC and its chair, Gary Gensler, held the belief that Ether constituted a security, at least for a certain period. 




Terret, referencing court documents filed by Consensys on April 29, stated that the SEC and Gensler “appear to have believed for at least a year” that Ether was an “unregistered security trading out of compliance with current federal regulations.”



This disclosure follows Consensys’ submission of an unredacted complaint against the SEC to a Texas federal court on April 25, in response to a Wells notice from the SEC outlining its intent to sue Consensys for alleged violations of federal securities laws.



The newly revealed documents indicate that on March 28, 2023, Gurbir Grewal, the head of the SEC’s Division of Enforcement, sanctioned a formal investigation into Ether’s classification as a security. 




Dubbed the “Ethereum 2.0” investigation, this initiative empowered enforcement personnel to scrutinize and subpoena individuals and entities engaged in the trading of the cryptocurrency.



Sources familiar with the matter, speaking on condition of anonymity, disclosed that subpoena recipients were instructed to maintain strict confidentiality regarding the investigation if they sought additional information from the SEC.



The genesis of the “Ethereum 2.0” investigation stemmed from the SEC’s suspicion that potential unregistered offerings and sales of Ether had taken place since at least 2018.

Should the SEC under Gensler’s leadership deem Ether a security, it would contradict prior guidance provided by the SEC under former Chair Jay Clayton. 



In June 2018, Bill Hinman, then-Director of Corporation Finance, declared in a speech the SEC’s stance that Ether, along with Bitcoin, did not qualify as securities.



Further revelations from the filings indicate that the five-member commission authorized the Division of Enforcement’s “Ethereum 2.0” investigation on April 13, 2023, merely five days before Gensler faced questioning before the House Financial Services Committee, where he declined to clarify the SEC’s stance on Ether’s classification as a security.



This development coincides with recent assertions by applicants and entities involved in a potential Ether exchange-traded fund in the U.S., suggesting an anticipated delay by the SEC in reaching a decision regarding the approval of such a product in May.



ETF analyst Eric Balchunas from Bloomberg believes that Gensler’s ambiguous position on Ether could influence the decision-making process, given his previous reluctance to define Ether as a security.

                        The testing version of the ckETH minter on Internet Computer (ICP) mainnet has been upgraded, now featuring the Sepolia version of the USDC token.In a recent forum post, Christian Müller, Senior Software Engineer at DFINITY, revealed that users can obtain Sepolia ETH from various faucets available online and Sepolia USDC to engage with the Sepolia ETH and USDC tokens.Once acquired, users can deposit both Sepolia ETH and USDC to mint ckETH and ckUSDC, respectively. DFINITY Foundation is a not-for-profit organization developing technology for the Internet Computer (ICP) blockchain.Internet Computer’ ckETH is Not Required to Deposit USDC
It’s important to note that while ckETH is not required to deposit USDC, it is necessary to withdraw ckUSDC and receive USDC back. Additionally, a portion of the ckSepoliaETH will be used by the minter canister to cover transfer transactions on the Sepolia testnet.The canister IDs of the ckSepoliaETH minter are also available for reference. Furthermore, the ckSepoliaETH minter offers a dashboard displaying conversions and corresponding Ethereum transactions for both ckETH and ckERC20 transactions. Developers interested in supporting conversions between ERC20 and the corresponding ck-twin token in their dapps are encouraged to start experimenting with ckUSDC.Müller emphasizes that the project is still in development, meaning users may encounter bugs and the canister’s state may reset upon upgrades. “It is expected that there are still bugs. Please help us make ckETH/ckUSDC rock solid by reporting those here,” he wrote. “In case the instructions don’t work for you, please report back, and we’ll be happy to help and improve the instructions.”It’s worth noting that, currently, there is no user-friendly front-end available, so users should be comfortable using dfx calls, especially for the final step.In June last year, the ICP launched an upgrade proposed by the community to expand support for all canister smart contracts, enabling users to hold and transfer ICP tokens.Meanwhile, DFINITY aims to directly integrate the Bitcoin (BTC) network with the Internet Computer, bringing smart contracts to Bitcoin through an application of Chain Key cryptography, they said.

New 'Brokewell' Smartphone Attack Drains Bank Accounts and Leaks Location, Posing 'Significant Threat to Banking Industry': Report - The Daily Hodl


								Security researchers are issuing an urgent alert about a new malware attack that’s targeting Android users’ bank accounts.
The malware, which has been nicknamed “Brokewell,” takes the form of a fake Google Chrome browser update webpage that mimics Google’s own messaging style, reports ThreatFabric.










When users are directed to the page, they see a message stating that Chrome needs to be updated.
If users fall for the fake ad, criminals gain full control of the device, allowing them to capture banking credentials as they’re entered on screen as well as record audio, collect information about the device, access call history and track geolocation data.
“The analysis of the samples revealed that Brokewell poses a significant threat to the banking industry, providing attackers with remote access to all assets available through mobile banking. The Trojan appears to be in active development, with new commands added almost daily.”
Source: ThreatFabric / Fake Ad Depicted on Right
ThreatFabric says its analysis shows the malicious application is a previously unknown malware family with a wide range of capabilities.
“Brokewell is equipped with “accessibility logging,” capturing every event happening on the device: touches, swipes, information displayed, text input, and applications opened. All actions are logged and sent to the command-and-control server, effectively stealing any confidential data displayed or entered on the compromised device…
Malware families like Brokewell pose a significant risk for customers of financial institutions, leading to successful fraud cases that are hard to detect without proper fraud detection measures. We believe that only a comprehensive, multi-layered fraud detection solution—based on a combination of indicators, including device, behavior, and identity risks for each customer—can effectively identify and prevent potential fraud from malware families like the newly discovered Brokewell.”
The Federal Trade Commission (FTC) has released a set of guidelines on how to avoid malware attacks.
Among other things, the agency recommends that people download well-known software directly from the source, avoid clicking potentially suspicious links, ignore pop ups, read browser security alerts and scan devices for malicious activity.

Oil King (OILKING) to Explode 8,300% After Solana Launch, Looks to Challenge Shiba Inu and Dogecoin



                    

Oil King (OILKING) could become a viral memecoin, like Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE).



Oil King (OILKING), a Solana memecoin that was launched today, is aiming to challenge other memecoin giants, such as Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE).




Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Oil King presents a similar opportunity.



Oil King has market cap below $25,000 at the moment, meaning that when it just reaches a modest market cap of $200,000-$500,000, early investors would generate massive returns in a matter of days or hours.



The exciting memecoin is poised to rally 8,300% in the coming two days, and Oil King could potentially reach a multi-million dollar market cap within a few weeks.




Currently, Oil King can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jupiter and Raydium, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days.



To buy Oil King on these platforms, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Oil King by entering its contract address – H5LmDBec75DmGLwtALURVAtLuVDUX1GMh5CGQ8r5h5rU – in the receiving field.



In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price.



If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner.




The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum.



This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like OILKING.

Arbitrum leads Ethereum L2s in key areas: Will ARB's price follow? - AMBCrypto



Arbitrum outperformed all other Ethereum L2s in overall inflows.
Activity on the network grew, but TVL continued to decline.

Ever since Arbitrum [ARB] launched its token, it has taken over the L2 space, and how!
Over the last few months, the protocol has managed to retain its dominance in the Layer 2 sector despite new entrants.
Layer 2 networks see growth
According to Token Terminal’s data, Arbitrum has managed to see one of the highest amounts of inflows and has out-competed other Layer 2 solutions on the Ethereum [ETH] network.
Source: Token Terminal
Arbitrum was doing extremely well in terms of activity as well. AMBCrypto’s analysis of Artemis’ data revealed that the number of daily active addresses on the Arbitrum network had grown significantly.
In the past week, the number of active addresses grew from 250,000 to 400,000. The number of daily transactions grew as well, sitting at around 1.5 million at press time.
Source: Artemis
Some problems ahead
However, there were some problems being faced by Arbitrum on the DeFi front.
Notably, the DEX (Decentralized Exchange) volumes on Arbitrum had fallen from 2.2 billion to 500 million over the course of the last few days.
Coupled with that, the TVL (Total Value Locked) also took a hit. Since March, the TVL collected on Arbitrum fell from $3.30 billion to $2.65 billion.
The combination of these factors led to a loss of revenue for the network.
Source: Artemis
Another concern was the network development. AMBCrypto’s examination of Token Terminal’s data revealed that the number of code commits had declined.
Coupled with that, the number of core developers contributing to the network had also fallen. These factors could impede the overall growth of Arbitrum, going forward.
Source: Token Terminal
Even though these factors may momentarily impact Arbitrum’s growth, its rising activity proves that the protocol can improve in the future as users continue to stay interested in the network.
Moreover, the popularity of Layer 2 solutions such as Arbitrum, helps the popularity of Layer 1s, in this case, Ethereum.

Realistic or not, here’s ARB’s market cap in BTC’s terms

Layer 2 solutions help networks such as Ethereum scale, and make the network more accessible for users as well.
The growth of the Arbitrum protocol will invariably result in the rise in popularity of the Ethereum network as well.

With an infectious smile and upbeat personality, Sunny’s name is surprisingly apt. He’s the type of person whose deep intellect, quick wit, and unbridled passion light up the spaces around him.We were scheduled to meet at Cosmos Dubai during Token2049 but life had other plans. The Cosmos side event wasn’t to be. Dubai was struck by the worst floods in 75 years, reducing the skyscraping desert metropolis to a lake and plunging entire neighborhoods underwater. “There’s always Cosmoverse in October,” Sunny smiles. “We can catch up in person then.”The rise and rise of OsmosisI was looking forward to seeing what outfit Sunny would wear; he has quite the collection, donning a spectrum of eye-popping costumes, from a 40lb suit of chainmail armor to a Byzantine General costume with a striking red-crested helmet. “Ah, I keep the cooler outfits for the bigger events like Cosmoverse or Osmocon,” he explains, “if I wore a new one for every event, my costume budget would get way too high,” he laughs. On the other side of the screen, from Sunny’s New York apartment, he looks decidedly more lowkey today.As the Cosmos ecosystem’s largest decentralized exchange (DEX), Osmosis announced surpassing $32 billion in all-time trading volume that day. I ask how it feels to mastermind the most popular project in Cosmos and to reach such an impressive milestone.“I think it said Osmosis DEX wanted to get to $40 billion, [in the tweet]” he replies, “but I’m waiting for $100 billion.”Sunny is unashamedly ambitious. Did he always know Osmosis would be such a success? He ponders:“The immediate traction it got when we launched was very surprising. Cosmos had a lot of high-value assets that weren’t listed on centralized exchanges, but we didn’t realize how big of a deal that would be.”Growth hacking and the bumps along the roadIt wasn’t all smooth sailing to get here. Sunny has been in the web3 industry since 2017. Like all battle-hardened OGs, he’s lived through his fair share of ups and downs — crypto crashes, bear markets, and all-out implosions like Terra (LUNA) and FTX. I ask the most stressful situation he’s experienced so far, and he pauses:“I think I would have to say the Osmosis launch week. It was my first time launching a project and a company and a blockchain at once. There are a lot of last-mile things you don’t think about.”Osmosis had publicly announced its launch date and, unlike the plethora of software projects that kick their launch dates down the road like the proverbial can, Sunny was adamant about not moving his. But as more and more last-mile items kept piling up, the launch date hung over the team’s head like a dark and brooding cloud.“Osmosis went from idea to launch very quickly,” he says. “We went from development to launch in only three or four months and we procrastinated on a lot of important stuff until the last two weeks.”Would he have done anything differently with the benefit of hindsight?“I would have planned things further in advance. When you launch a project, there’s more than just the code. There’s a lot of operational stuff to consider and it takes longer than you think… I would have done all that a lot earlier.”Osmosis launched with a team of six and, despite the scrappy start, now has 45 full-time employees:“I like the size we’re at now,” he says. “We’re small enough that you still know everyone and can do full team offsite, but we’re big enough to pursue multiple unique product lines in parallel.”How does he handle the stress of being at the forefront of an ever-evolving industry? By throwing himself out of planes. Sunny’s a fan of aviation and is learning how to fly a plane, and taking a skydiving course.“I find it’s best to put yourself in a position where you can’t touch your phone, like flying a plane, or scuba diving,” (or hurtling toward the earth at 120 miles an hour). “Crypto markets aren’t volatile enough, I have to add more adrenaline,” he laughs.Travel, idols, and a ‘liveness-favoring’ mindSpending so much time in the air, Sunny also likes to travel, and if there’s one place closest to his heart, it’s Switzerland. He’s always been fascinated with the mountainous Alpine country and its rich history, culture, politics, and economy.He even taught a class about Switzerland while studying at Berkeley. He wouldn’t want to live there, though, as it’s “just a little bit too boring.” Sunny prefers the frenetic pace of a city like New York or “being at the front seat of technological innovation” in San Francisco’s Silicon Valley. He also loves Berlin, where his co-founder lives, and has many friends. “It’s like a second home.”Beyond continually improving Osmosis, helping other Cosmos ecosystem projects, and racking up his pilot miles, Sunny’s a keen reader. One of his biggest idols is Peter Thiel, whose writing and “way of thinking” greatly influenced Sunny’s worldview. Beyond Thiel’s Zero to One, he recommends the book Swarmwise by Rick Falkvinge, the founder of the Pirate Party political movement in Europe. The book speaks of how Falkvinge started a political party and turned it into a decentralized force through a concept called “swarms.”He elaborates:“In consensus protocols, you have this concept of safety-favoring and liveness-favoring protocols. In safety-favoring, you can never fork, you come to consensus on everything and then you make progress. Liveness-favoring protocols are constantly forking but they’re making fast progress, you don’t have to get the approval of the entire group to make a move… In the early stages of an organization where you’re focusing on growth, you need that liveness favoring so you don’t get bogged down in bureaucracy.”A ‘Bitcoin maxi’ of a different ilkAs a self-declared “Bitcoin maxi,” Sunny does not doubt the original crypto being the best money for the world; but the glacial pace of development doesn’t gel with his need for constant innovation. That’s why he worked on Cosmos infrastructure in the first place, “building the appchain layer for Bitcoin.” What’s he most excited about right now?“Definitely the Bitcoin renaissance. Ordinals changed everything, there’s been a cultural shift with all the Bitcoin L2s happening. I’m confident that we’ll have a good soft fork in the next year or two.”Wouldn’t that be a detriment to the sound-money qualities and adoption of Bitcoin as an asset? “It’s the limitations of Bitcoin that have caused the need for so many other money-like assets, but now Bitcoin can scale to more people and do more functionalities, like bring in DeFi, privacy, social… there’s a lot of stuff we can do on top of Bitcoin now.”What would Sunny be doing if he didn’t spend his time disrupting traditional finance? “Hardware.” Before working in crypto, Sunny studied robotics at school, and he’d like to return to his roots someday.“There are different ideas I’ve had. I spent a lot of time thinking about smart guns, having firearms that are safer, with security systems, like fingerprint scanners so people can’t steal them.” He pauses, “I’m really interested in anything that has an important political impact. That’s why I got into crypto in the first place.”If you want to catch up with Sunny, follow his personal Twitter or Osmosis account, or hop on over to his website for ideas and inspiration.

Bitcoin price shows strength: Analysts predict rally to $73,000

Bitcoin has shown strength, trading at .$63,667.93, and analysts say that it could reach $73,000 in the upcoming weeks. The crypto, which corrected sharply, has recovered well, prompting the bulls back in. Investors and traders anticipate more price reboundTechnical analysis indicators show Bitcoin trend as bullishTechnical analysis has a favorable point for Bitcoin, highlighting indicators like Bollinger bands indicating a bullish moment. The crypto’s fluctuating behavior on the 4-hour sheet, may mark a probable inclining movement. To grasp the significance of Bitcoin reaching above the $61,999 50-day EMA, it must be understood that it has historically been a sign of bullish market continuation and fluctuations.Source: coin market capThis pattern has been followed by a ‘three white soldiers’ candlestick pattern, which is extra strong evidence to back up the bullish attitude, which could, in turn, lead to further price increments. The traders use these signals to boost their confidence in making further profits by betting on the higher side of Bitcoin in a short period of time.Resistance and support levelsTrend reversals in the present market environment are difficult to predict, and the importance of resistance and support in determining price movements is becoming increasingly evident. Bitcoin is experiencing first-tier obstacles at $66,796 and $69,328. In case of a successful rise above these values, it can have an escalation below, which may cause it to develop. Apart from that, at $71,180, resistance lies before  Bitcoin’s all-time high again or not. Bitcoin will only manage that if it rises above $67,500, as per analysts.The level of resistance could be reached up to $61,735 in case of Bitcoin’s trend, providing support, to prevent sharp declines. The following lines of resistance are designated by $59,550 and $56,625 which are the levels to help the price to regain its grounds if the trend goes down.The market experts closely follow Bitcoin’s price rallies and might see $73,000 as a new high point if certain resistance levels are broken. The recovery of Bitcoin after a short correction pushed the market of crypto assets back but generated excitement among traders.As the majority of analysts claim that Bitcoin must gradually break the $67,500 mark once again, such a breakthrough may lead the way to result in more aggressive thrusts. The technical analysts advise that it would be risky not to climb higher than this level, which could lead to retesting of the support levels that have been taken.

Bitcoin Network Sets Record with Over 1.6 Million Transactions in a Day



                    

On April 23, the Bitcoin network achieved a new record with the highest number of confirmed daily transactions, just three days after entering a new halving cycle that started on April 20. 



This surge brought the total to over 1.6 million unique transactions processed between various senders and receivers.




Data comparisons from sources such as Blockchain.com and Glassnode have linked the spike in transactions to the launch of Bitcoin Runes. 



This new offering serves as an alternative to the existing Bitcoin Ordinals and the BRC-20 protocol on the Bitcoin blockchain, capturing a significant portion of the daily transaction volume. 



Notably, Runes accounted for 81.3% of all Bitcoin transactions on the day of the record.




Despite this initial dominance by Runes, Bitcoin (BTC) transactions regained their majority status over the network by April 29, with BTC transactions making up 77.8% of the total, while Runes transactions had decreased to 18.8%. 



The remainder of the transaction volume was made up of ordinals at 1.2% and BRC-20 transactions at 2.3%.



The influx of Bitcoin Runes transactions has proven beneficial for the mining sector. Major U.S. mining firms such as Stronghold Digital Mining and Marathon have reported positive impacts from the Runes transactions, both financially and functionally, as communicated to Cointelegraph.

Since the halving, Rune transactions have contributed over 1,200 BTC in transaction fees to miners.



Although the excitement surrounding Bitcoin Runes seems to be waning, Ignas, a pseudonymous decentralized finance (DeFi) researcher, sees continued potential in this market. 



In a post dated April 17 on platform X, Ignas commented, “Runestone, RSIC, and PUPS are already pumping, promising holders shiny new Rune token airdrops. 



And FOMO threads keep coming. But, like the NFT frenzy post-JPEG reveal, the market could soon cool off.”



Runes and BRC-20 tokens represent new fungible token standards designed to expand Bitcoin’s utility within the emerging sector of Bitcoin DeFi, or BTCFi. 



This initiative marks a significant shift towards integrating more complex financial functions directly on the Bitcoin blockchain, illustrating a growing trend of innovation within the cryptocurrency landscape.

Shiba Inu Price Forecast: Analysts Eye $0.00017 Amid Crypto Market Volatility



                    

Recent downward trends in the cryptocurrency market have exerted downward pressure on the price of Shiba Inu (SHIB). 



Nonetheless, several analysts remain optimistic about the token’s future trajectory, foreseeing it potentially reaching $0.00017 in the coming years.




Oscar Ramos, a well-known advocate for Shiba Inu, projects that the asset could hit $0.00017 by 2025, aligning with the anticipated culmination of the ongoing crypto bull cycle. 



This optimistic outlook implies a substantial 640% increase for investors who buy SHIB at its current price of $0.00002296.



On the other hand, platforms like Changelly and Telegaon adopt a more cautious stance, proposing a six-year timeframe for SHIB to attain this valuation, suggesting $0.000059994 as a potentially more realistic peak during the current bull market.




The possibility of SHIB reaching $0.0001 or beyond has been a frequent topic of discussion among analysts, citing its past performance as a basis for optimism. 



Analyst Eunice Wong suggests that a similar surge could propel SHIB to $0.000125.



Furthermore, SHIB’s expanding roster of partnerships adds to the positive sentiment surrounding its future prospects.

Collaborations such as the recent venture with CDSA to utilize Shibarium for combating piracy, alongside another undisclosed partnership hinted at by lead developer Shytoshi Kusama, contribute to the bullish outlook for the asset.



However, the prevailing bearish sentiment in the market has led to a decline in Shiba Inu’s price in recent months. 



According to data from CoinMarketCap, SHIB is presently trading at $0.00002466, marking a notable decrease from its peak in early March.



Analysts hold differing views on when SHIB might achieve the $0.00017 price target. 



While some anticipate it occurring within the current bull cycle, others believe it could take longer. 



Various factors, including market dynamics, successful partnerships, and the overall cryptocurrency market’s resilience, are anticipated to influence Shiba Inu’s trajectory moving forward.



As always, it’s imperative to acknowledge the high volatility inherent in cryptocurrency markets. 



Conducting thorough research and understanding one’s risk tolerance are essential prerequisites before making any investment decisions.

PEPE's fork PORK faces bloodbath: Here's what's going on - AMBCrypto



Metrics revealed that selling pressure on PORK increased. 
Most indicators hinted at a further price drop. 

Pepe’s [PEPE] forked token, PepeFork [PORK], gained much traction in the crypto community as its social metrics soared. While PORK’s popularity rose, its price action moved the other way around. 
Therefore, AMBCrypto planned to check PEPE and PORK’s current states to see how they are faring against each other. 
PORK’s latest bloodbath 
LunarCrush’s latest tweet highlighted an interesting development related to PORK, as its social metrics soared. 
A possible reason behind this increase in popularity could be the meme coin’s weekly rally of over 12%. 
Thanks to the price uptick, sentiment around the meme coin remained bullish, as evident from its high Weighted Sentiment.
Source: Santiment
However, the bull trend didn’t last long, as the meme coin witnessed a major price correction. According to CoinMarketCap, the meme coin was down by more than 10% in the last 24 hours alone. 
At press time, it was trading at $0.0000002431 with a market capitalization of over $102 million. 
AMBCrypto’s analysis of Santiment’s data revealed that PORK’s MVRV ratio dropped on the 5th of May, hinting that fewer investors were in profit. 
As the meme coin’s price turned bearish, investors chose to sell. This was the case as the meme coin’s active deposits increased. 
Additionally, its Supply on Exchanges increased, while its Supply outside of Exchanges dropped on the 5th of May. This meant that selling pressure was high at press time.
Source: Santiment
PEPE is in a better position
PEPE, on the other hand, acted differently. According to CoinMarketCap, its price only dropped 1.5% in the last 24 hours. 
At press time, it was trading at $0.000008569 with a market cap of $3.6 billion. Market sentiment around PEPE remained bullish as its Weighted Sentiment graph was up. 
Unlike PORK, PEPE remained under high buying pressure. The meme coin’s Supply on Exchanges dropped, while its Supply outside of Exchanges increased over the last week. 
In fact, AMBCrypto reported earlier about the possibility of PEPE touching $0.00001 in the coming days.
Source: Santiment
What to expect from PORK
Since PORK was in a concerning state, AMBCrypto planned to check its daily chart to better understand whether it could change the bearish trend. 
We found that its Relative Strength Index (RSI) registered a sharp downtick. 

Realistic or not, here’s PORK’s market cap in DOGE’s terms

The Chaikin Money Flow (CMF) also followed a similar declining trend. These suggested that the chances of a continued price decline were high.
Nonetheless, the MACD remained in buyers’ favor as it displayed a bullish advantage in the market.

Crypto Trader Says Three Altcoins Are His Golden Tickets, Flips Bullish on One Memecoin With ‘Monster’ Chart - The Daily Hodl


								An analyst who continues to build a following with timely crypto calls says he has his radar locked on three altcoins.
Pseudonymous trader The Crypto Dog tells his 776,300 followers on the social media platform X that he’s bullish on an Ethereum (ETH) challenger and a pair of memecoins as the digital asset market bounces.










“Seems NEAR, WIF and PEPE are my golden tickets right now.”
On Near (NEAR), the crypto analyst says that he unloaded some of his Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum holdings to accumulate the ETH rival.
“You might have seen me try NEAR long last month. Didn’t work out with the whole market pullback, but kept my hunch it would outperform when we bottom.
I moved a chunk of spot ETH and BTC into NEAR earlier to ride into new yearly highs. Longed as well but closed too early.”
At time of writing, NEAR is trading for $6.84.
Looking at Pepe (PEPE),  the trader says the memecoin looks strong on the three-day chart.
“One hell of a chart.”
Source: The Crypto Dog/X
At time of writing, PEPE is worth $0.0000086, up over 6% in the last 24 hours.
As for Floki (FLOKI), the trader says the memecoin looks very bullish on the higher time frame.
“Maybe I should look at FLOKI too, that chart is a monster zoomed out.”
Source: The Crypto Dog/X
At time of writing, Floki is worth $0.00019, up over 9% in the past day.

Bitcoin reaches one billion transactions

The Bitcoin network has processed its one billionth transaction — marking a huge milestone moment for the network 15 years after its creation.Clark Moody’s Bitcoin dashboard shows that transaction 1,000,000,000 had been reached, which was mined into block 842,241 at 9:34 pm UTC on May 5, other data shows.Total number of transactions processed on the Bitcoin network. Source: Clark MoodyIt comes 15 years, four months and four days after Bitcoin (BTC) pseudonymous creator, Satoshi Nakamoto, mined the network’s first block on Jan. 3, 2009.It means an average of 178,475 daily transactions have been made on Bitcoin in its 5,603 day existence.


However, the transaction count doesn't include those made on the Lightning Network, a Bitcoin layer 2 network primarily focused on micropayments.Data from the Bitcoin-only exchange River found the Lightning Network processed a lower-bound estimate of 6.6 million transactions alone in August, 2023 — which could suggest that hundreds of millions of transactions have been made on Lightning since it launched in January, 2018.Daily transactions on Bitcoin spiked around the network’s fourth halving event on April 20, including a record high 926,000 transactions processed on April 23.Much of this demand came from the launch of the Runes protocol — a new Bitcoin token standard — at block 840,000.That said, Bitcoin’s daily transaction count has since cooled off to 660,260 on May 4.Despite Bitcoin being the oldest cryptocurrency network, it isn’t the first of its kind to process one billion transactions.Bitcoin's biggest rival, Ethereum, has processed well over 2 billion transactions since it launched in July 2015, Etherscan data shows.Related: Impact of Bitcoin halving event on transaction confirmation timesBitcoin is currently priced at $63,750, up over 12% since it hit a two-month low of $56,800 on May 2, according to CoinGecko.However, it is still down 13,6% from its all-time high of $73,740 set on March 13.Bitcoin’s change in price over the last 12 months.

BTC-e Founder Admits $9B Money Laundering Conspiracy Charge - DailyCoin


        
The BTC-e case has finally concluded. 



Co-founder Alexander Vinnik has pleaded guilty.



The DOJ accused Vinnik of laundering billions. 
US regulators have been relentless in their crackdown on crypto, targeting anyone that even smells of money laundering, including notable figures such as Tornado Cash co-founders, Binance’s former CEO Changpeng ‘CZ’ Zhao, FTX founder Sam Bankman-Friend (SBF), and more. Now joining this infamous list is BTC-e founder Alexander Vinnik, who, after a grueling five-year legal battle, has finally pleaded guilty to laundering billions. BTC-e Founder’s AdmissionOn Friday, May 3, the United States Department of Justice (DOJ) revealed that BTC-e’s co-founder Alexander Vinnik admitted to his role in money laundering through the exchange from 2011 to 2017, marking the climax of a years-long case.During Vinnik’s leadership, the DOJ detailed that BTC-e processed over $9 billion in transactions and amassed over one million users worldwide, mostly based in the US. Shockingly, the regulator revealed that over $4 billion worth of Bitcoin was laundered through the exchange.
Authorities highlighted that the platform was utilized to launder funds acquired from various criminal enterprises, including computer hacking, ransomware attacks, and drug trafficking. The investigation uncovered BTC-e’s flagrant disregard for legal compliance, notably lacking registration with the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) and AML or KYC protocols. With its lax compliance measures, BTC-e swiftly became a haven for bad actors seeking to evade regulatory scrutiny. The DOJ revealed Vinnik’s establishment of numerous shell companies and financial accounts worldwide, facilitating the illicit transfer of funds through the exchange and resulting in criminal losses exceeding $121 million.Following Vinnik’s admission, a federal court judge will now determine the co-founder’s sentence. Drawing parallels to the cases of Binance’s Changpeng ‘CZ’ Zhao and FTX’s SBF, Vinnik could face a sentence ranging from four months to 25 years.On the Flipside
Vinnik, a Russian citizen, previously attempted to broker a prisoner swap deal as part of negotiations between Russia and the United States. 



BTC-e was heavily implicated in the infamous Mt.Gox Hack.



In 2023, Alexey Bilyuchenko, an associate of Vinnik and former technology administrator of BTC-e, was fined and sentenced to three years and six months in prison for embezzling the exchange’s funds.
Why This MattersVinnik’s admission marks the end of a five-year legal saga, bringing closure to all those impacted by BTC-e. It also serves as a crucial juncture in cleansing the industry of bad actors and a stark example of the consequences for those who try to curb the law.Is BitFinex under threat?BitFinex Under Threat?

                        A top South Korean prosecution official says courts must deliver swifter justice to crypto offenders – with cases currently taking “too long” to process.The comments came from Lee Jeong-ryeol, the head of the Seoul Southern District Prosecutors’ Office’s joint crypto investigation unit, in an interview with the newspaper Hanguk Kyungjae.The unit is the nation’s only investigative organization dedicated to crypto-related crimes.Swifter Justice Will Help Fight Crypto Crime – Prosecutor
Lee claimed that “regulation rollouts” and the “punishment” of crypto-related crimes “have been slow.” He said:“We must restore trust in the virtual assets market, which has turned into a lawless zone. To do this, we must speed up not only the pace of investigations, but also trials and sentencing.”Lee insisted that while crypto-related crimes present courts with novel aspects, at their core, they are essentially no different from conventional financial fraud.He said that neither investigative agencies nor courts “should find it difficult to deal with virtual asset crimes using new IT.”Lee justified this by stating that the “essence of stealing property through lies does not change – regardless of the technology involved.” He said:“An integrated response across the government is urgently needed. This kind of approach will help address the problem of fast-evolving financial and high-tech crimes.”The prosecutor added:“We will only be able to help victims recover their funds if investigations can be conducted rapidly.”The main entry to the Seoul Southern District Prosecutors’ Office.

Lee is the unit’s first director. He was appointed when the team launched in July 2023.The unit is South Korea’s first and only dedicated cryptoasset investigation organization.It comprises around 30 professionals from seven government-funded agencies, including the National Tax Service, the Prosecution Service, the Financial Supervisory Service, the Financial Services Commission-run Financial Intelligence Unit, and the Korea Customs Service.The unit also comprises members of the Korea Deposit Insurance Corporation, the nation’s bank deposit protection agency, as well as the Korea Exchange.Since its launch, the agency appears to have been inundated with cases. These include a high-profile art-themed altcoin case involving police and prosecution corruption.Lee also noted that his unit has been dealing with cases such as “illegal over-the-counter (OTC) trade networks” worth “around $478 million.”The Financial Services Commission (FSC) building in Seoul, South Korea.

The unit has also investigated allegations surrounding Haru Invest and the crypto lending platform Delio, after the latter suspended withdrawals in October 2023.Lee also spoke about the challenging nature of his unit’s work, with investigators often entering terra incognita with their probes. He said:“The cases the joint unit investigates are mostly first-of-their-kind cases with no existing legal precedent.”Lee also commented on a recent wave of reports centering on alleged South Korean “scam coins,” saying:“Scam coins are no different from general scams. At their heart, their operators are out to make money by deceiving people.”Last month, police arrested a man for allegedly stealing almost $362,000 worth of cash in an armed robbery on an OTC crypto buyer.

Solana, AI, Memes: Daniel Yan’s Picks for May Outperformance


Amid the turbulence that rocked cryptocurrency markets in April, Daniel Yan, the Chief Investment Officer of Kryptanium Capital, has a clear vision for May’s trading strategies. 
He focuses on artificial intelligence (AI), Solana, and meme coins as potential leaders for a rebound.
AI, Solana, Memes to Lead May Catchup Trade
A blend of macroeconomic triggers and market dynamics marked April’s crypto crash. The US’s persistent inflation and hot labor market led to a significant selloff in US treasuries, impacting cryptocurrencies that are sensitive to such macroeconomic factors. Additionally, the behavior of the spot Bitcoin ETFs, which, contrary to expectations, acted more as a trading instrument than a stable investment, contributed to April’s downturn.
Altcoins suffered acutely due to poor liquidity and heavy unlocking schedules, leading to a dramatic drop not seen since the tumultuous events of 2022. 


“The medium performer of the top 100 tokens on CoinMarketCap in April saw a decline of 33%, compared with a milder 15.5% dip for Bitcoin and Ethereum,” Yan explained.

However, after a series of positive macroeconomic updates, Yan sees a silver lining. The introduction of the US Treasury Department’s first bond buyback program since 2002 and a dovish statement from the Federal Open Market Committee have helped stabilize the crypto market. These factors contributed to Bitcoin’s over 10% rebound in just a few days.
Looking into May, Yan predicts it to be a “very macro month for crypto.” He expects market stability until the mid-month Consumer Price Index report, likely influencing market direction. Specifically, Yan is bullish on categories like Solana, AI-driven coins, and meme tokens. 

“Solana category, AI category and Memes category are my top picks for the catchup trade – they should outperform Bitcoin in May. In general, I don’t think the theses for a very bullish 2024 is challenged at all. However, the April crash is a great lesson to all market players,” Yan asserted.

Despite April’s challenges, Yan remains optimistic about the long-term prospects of cryptos, viewing the recent crash as a crucial lesson for market participants.

1.24 Trillion PEPE Meme Coins Bought By Crypto Whale


A remarkable transaction has shaken the cryptocurrency market as a crypto whale reportedly invested $10.4 million into meme coin PEPE. 
This substantial investment, unfolding amid a surge in market activity, has triggered intense discussion about the future of this meme-inspired digital asset.
Crypto Whale Buys 1.24 Trillion PEPE Tokens
Spot On Chain, a well-regarded crypto analytics platform, spotlighted the transaction. Details emerged about a multi-signature wallet known as 0x1a2e64b8a1977bf018850b377020bc33eaaac3c9, which facilitated the movement of an astonishing 915.85 billion PEPE tokens from Binance. 
This initial transaction was valued at approximately $7.75 million, calculated at a rate of $0.000008466 per token.

In a swift succession over the next 28 hours, the same wallet executed additional withdrawals. It amassed a total of 1.238 trillion PEPE tokens from the centralized exchange. This sequence of transactions cumulatively amounted to the eye-catching $10.4 million PEPE investment.

“Overall, the wallet has withdrawn 1.238 trillion PEPE via 2 transactions from Binance at $0.000008424 on average ($10.4 million) in the past 28 hours for the first PEPE trade. Previously, the whale had gained $146,000 (+14.2%) from one INJ trade but lost $118,000 (-8.01%) from one RNDR trade. The whale did not hold both tokens for long,” analysts at Spot On Chain said.

Currently, PEPE exhibits promising market trends. Despite a slight 1.2% dip in the last 24 hours, the meme coin has soared by 29.70% over the last month. With PEPE trading at $0.000008532, its position above the 50-day Simple Moving Average and a healthy Relative Strength Index of 62.78 indicate a stable market sentiment, reinforcing investor confidence.

The influx of significant capital into PEPE highlights an expanding interest in niche cryptocurrencies. Indeed, these tend to benefit from robust community support and a meme-based allure. PEPE’s unique frog-themed branding has endeared it to a broad audience, contributing to its growing traction in digital currency.
Although the motives of the whale remain undisclosed, market analysts suggest that the investor might be capitalizing on the rising potential of meme coins to diversify their investment portfolio and harness nascent market opportunities.

Chainlink Partners with Rapid Addition to Launch FIX-Native Adapter for Enhanced Digital Asset Trading



                    

Blockchain oracle provider Chainlink has announced a partnership with FIX connectivity solutions firm Rapid Addition to create a FIX-native adapter aimed at enhancing institutional digital asset trading. 



This initiative leverages Chainlink’s Cross-Chain Interoperability Protocol (CCIP), designed to facilitate a variety of applications such as token transfers, gaming, and decentralized finance (DeFi).




Chainlink’s new development focuses on enabling banks and financial institutions to seamlessly communicate and interact with a diverse range of tokenized assets. 



The organization identifies this venture as a promising market opportunity, potentially revolutionizing sectors like renewable energy, carbon credits, and real-world assets (RWAs) including real estate, infrastructure, and collectibles.



Vince Turcotte, Chainlink Labs’ business development lead for Asia Pacific, shared insights with Cointelegraph regarding the capabilities of this adapter. 




Drawing parallels to Chainlink’s collaboration with the SWIFT banking system, Turcotte highlighted that financial entities can utilize the adapter to embed smart contracts with specific FIX tags and instructions. 



He emphasized its utility in the post-trade process, stating, “We expect this will be particularly useful for the post-trade environment, as it will allow a single source of truth for trade allocations, which can be shared simultaneously and without duplication between asset managers, brokers, and custodians.”



Turcotte also noted that the adapter facilitates integration into existing legacy systems, enhancing the efficiency by reducing settlement errors and rejections.

He explained that the synergy between Chainlink and FIX will allow traditional risk and execution platforms to effectively interact with emergent blockchain-based asset types.



Discussing the broader implications of this technological advancement, Turcotte projected that digitally native institutions are likely to lead in adopting this integration. 



“We expect that digitally native institutions will be the early adopters of this integration. 



“These institutions recognize the value of using the FIX protocol to engage with the broader TradFi ecosystem and the value of permanence and truth via blockchain,” he elaborated.



Turcotte also mentioned the cost benefits for asset managers and their clients, who could economize by using a unified, continuously updated platform for settlement instructions. 



“Asset managers and their clients can save costs by having a single source of truth for settlement instructions available to all counterparties to a trade and constantly updated 24/7,” he added, pointing out the financial and operational efficiencies enabled by the new adapter.

Bitcoin liquidation drops but BTC holds at $60K - What's next? - AMBCrypto



Over the past 48 hours, Bitcoin’s liquidation has been below $50 million.
BTC has held the $60,000 price range.

The past week witnessed a significant decline in Bitcoin’s [BTC] price as it slipped below the $60,000 threshold. 
This downturn resulted in a surge of both short and long liquidations, causing some positions to be wiped out. 
However, there appears to be a recent equilibrium between price movement and liquidations, suggesting a stabilization in the market.
Bitcoin liquidation declines
AMBCrypto’s analysis of the Bitcoin liquidation chart on Coinglass revealed a surge in liquidation on the 30th of April and the 1st of May.
 On the 30th of April, the liquidation volume was over $113 million, with long positions accounting for over $95 million. 
This trend continued into the 1st of May, with the liquidation volume surpassing $136 million and long positions representing over $100 million. 
Source: Coinglass
However, as the price of BTC rebounded and reclaimed the $60,000 price range, the liquidation volume began to decline.
 Subsequently, since the 2nd of May, the liquidation volume has only exceeded $50 million once. The latest data shows that the liquidation volume was around $10 million at press time.
Bitcoin maintains trend above $60,000
AMBCrypto’s look at Bitcoin’s price trend on the daily timeframe chart indicated a notable rebound following its declines on the 30th of April and the 1st of May, during which it experienced an 8% loss over 48 hours.
 AMBCrypto’s chart analysis revealed consecutive uptrends beginning on the 2nd of May, with a notable increase of over 6% observed on the 3rd of May. 
Source: TradingView
By the end of trading on the 4th of May, Bitcoin had increased by over 1%, reaching approximately $63,900.
 As of this writing, it was trading with a decrease of less than 1%, but it still maintained the $63,000 price range. 
Despite this rebound, its short moving average (yellow line) continued to serve as resistance at around $66,000.
Strained profit for 30-days holders
Bitcoin’s 30-day Market Value Realized Value ratio (MVRV) indicated that holders experienced a period of being underwater for much of April. 
The chart revealed that BTC remained below zero and reached its lowest point in months, dropping to -9.71%.

However, at the time of this analysis, the MVRV has slightly risen above zero, hovering around 0.026%. 
This suggests that holders within this timeframe are profiting, likely due to the recent slight increase in BTC’s price.

Despite Bitcoin Hitting $64K, Analyst Says King Crypto Remains In 'Prime Buy Zone' - Benzinga

Bitcoin BTC/USD has surged to $64,000, but a key metric indicates that it’s still in a “prime buy zone,” according to a prominent crypto analyst.What Happened: Ali Martinez, a well-known crypto analyst, pointed out that despite Bitcoin’s recent price surge, the MVRV 90-day Ratio suggests that the cryptocurrency is still in a favorable buying position.“Despite #Bitcoin’s recent surge from $57,000 to $64,000, the MVRV 90-Day Ratio indicates that $BTC remains in a prime buy zone!” Martinez wrote.As per Martinez, the MVRV ratio, which divides an asset's market capitalization by its realized capitalization, is a crucial metric in the crypto space. A higher MVRV ratio typically indicates a greater potential profit, potentially leading to increased selling pressure.See Also: Dogecoin Is ‘Primed For Higher’ But Pepe Is ‘On A Moon Mission,’ Exclaims TraderWhy It Matters: This news comes in the wake of a series of significant events in the crypto space.

Bad actors and ‘block storms’ - Bitcoin dev calls for testnet reboot

Bitcoin’s most popular testnet is in dire need of a reboot due to “block storms” and projects being able to charge users for testnet Bitcoin (TBTC), says Jameson Lopp, the co-founder of Bitcoin custody firm Casa.In a May 4 essay titled “Griefing Bitcoin’s Testnet,” Lopp argued the Bitcoin testnet — TBTC — needs to be reset partially due to ongoing “block storms,” which come about due to a unique consensus mechanism on the testnet. While the Bitcoin mainnet produces an average of 144 blocks per day, the testnet — which is subject to “slightly different consensus rules” — will occasionally produce over 10,000 blocks in a single day.Bitcoin's testnet has produced over 10,000 blocks in a single day on several occasions. Source: Jameson LoppLopp explained that as a result of these “block storms” the network stands at a current block height of 2,811,000 which is the equivalent of where the Bitcoin mainnet would be in 2061.Lopp noted that due to the vast increase in the testnet’s block height, the rewards for testnet miners had been reduced to near zero making the network practically unusable for developers looking for new tokens.Related: Someone ‘shit in the jacuzzi’ — Bitcoiners furious after testnet griefingAdditionally, Lopp said that the now-scarce testnet Bitcoin was being coopted by certain projects looking to take advantage of the token’s scarcity. “It's not uncommon for malicious folks to prey upon people's naïveté and sell them testnet bitcoin at mainnet Bitcoin exchange rates,” he said. He pointed to a recent example of a Bitcoin-based layer-2 network dubbed SatoshiVM which had been using TBTC to distribute airdrops to its holders as an example of a project that had been creating artificial value on the testnet for its own purposes. He called out several projects, including a DEX called MotoSwap and a brokerage firm called Buy Tesnet — for selling testnet tokens to users.“The sole reason I'm advocating for a testnet reset is because testnet is supposed to be free for developers to use. Other than that, everyone should be free to use testnet for whatever development purpose they wish.”“It's important for every wallet that supports testnet to have a bold disclaimer on the main screen that testnet coins have no value!” Lopp added.Ultimately, Lopp concluded that the only way to ensure a testnet does not accrue value is to “instill a culture of regular resets” and advised Bitcoin developers and users to migrate their infrastructure to “testnet4” in the coming months.

It is stable above the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the upward move from the $56,378 swing low to the $64,646 high. There is also a key bullish trend line forming with support at $62,800 on the hourly chart of the BTC/USD pair.
Bitcoin is now trading above $62,500 and the 100 hourly Simple moving average. Immediate resistance is near the $64,500 level. The first major resistance could be $65,000. The next key resistance could be $65,500.

A clear move above the $65,500 resistance might send the price higher. The next resistance now sits at $66,800. If there is a clear move above the $66,800 resistance zone, the price could continue to move up. In the stated case, the price could rise toward $68,000.
Another Decline In BTC?
If Bitcoin fails to rise above the $64,500 resistance zone, it could start another decline. Immediate support on the downside is near the $62,800 level and the trend line.
The first major support is $61,500. If there is a close below $61,500, the price could start to drop toward the 61.8% Fib retracement level of the upward move from the $56,378 swing low to the $64,646 high at $59,500. Any more losses might send the price toward the $58,000 support zone in the near term.

Hourly MACD – The MACD is now losing pace in the bullish zone.
Hourly RSI (Relative Strength Index) – The RSI for BTC/USD is now near the 50 level.

Bitcoin shakes off bears with weekend's recovery - Crypto Briefing




Bitcoin has recovered early losses with an uptick of over 10% over the weekend, crossing the $64,000 benchmark after hitting a low of around $56,800 on Wednesday.The renewed inflows into the US spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) in Friday’s trading session, particularly the first-time inflows into Grayscale Bitcoin Trust, acted as a positive catalyst for Bitcoin’s price action.The bloodbath of earlier weekdays took much of the confidence out of the crypto market. However, like Bitcoin’s recovery, investor confidence appears to have returned over the weekend.According to Alternative’s fear and greed index, market sentiment turned from “greed” last week to “fear” on Wednesday, stayed neutral the next day, and switched to “greed” over the weekend.Despite the uncertainty surrounding the current correction in Bitcoin’s value, this period has historically presented a favorable buying opportunity. Furthermore, some analysts believe Bitcoin is poised for a significant price increase.Ki Young Ju, CEO of CryptoQuant, reported that Bitcoin whales had accumulated over 47,000 BTC on Friday. This accumulation suggests that the recent price correction, which saw Bitcoin fall below the $60,000 psychological mark, is viewed by institutional investors as an opportunity to buy.Technical analyst Rekt Capital noted that historically, Bitcoin has experienced a short “danger zone” post-halving before continuing its upward trend. He sees the recent correction, one of the longest in this cycle at 49 days, as a precursor to a potential bullish spike in value from mid-September to mid-October 2025.Bitcoin could stabilize between $60,000 and $70,000 until AugustIn his recent blog post, BitMEX founder Arthur Hayes anticipates that Bitcoin will regain momentum as market conditions improve, particularly after the US tax season and other temporary market pressures, like speculation around the Fed’s rate decision, Bitcoin halving, and ETF demand, subside.Hayes suggested that “stealth money printing” and adjustments to Federal Reserve policies and US Treasury policies increase the attractiveness of non-fiat assets like Bitcoin. He predicts that Bitcoin’s price will rally above $60,000 and then stabilize in the $60,000-$70,000 range until August.

Chinese Authorities Arrest Suspect for Identity Theft in StarkNet Airdrop Scam, Over $91,000 in Crypto Stolen



                    

Chinese authorities have arrested Lan Mou, a suspect involved in a major identity theft case related to the StarkNet (STRK) airdrop. 



Lan is accused of using stolen identities to submit over 40 fraudulent Early Community Member Program (ECMP) airdrop forms, illegally acquiring over 40,000 STRK tokens intended for rightful recipients.




The airdrop, which began on February 20, was part of a large-scale initiative by the StarkNet Foundation to distribute 700 million STRK tokens. 



The airdrop targeted various groups within the Ethereum community, including solo and liquid stakers, StarkNet developers and users, and contributors outside the Web3 ecosystem. 



It drew significant attention, with the first 45 million STRK tokens claimed within just 90 minutes.




Following the airdrop, the stolen STRK tokens were transferred to an OKX wallet and converted into more than $91,000 in Tether. 



Lan Mou’s arrest occurred on April 25 in Guangdong Province, where authorities seized a computer and two mobile phones linked to the operation.



The incident sheds light on the prevalent issue of scams and phishing in the cryptocurrency sector. 



However, this case of identity theft for claiming airdrops on such a grand scale is particularly noteworthy, signaling a new level of threat in the space.

Yearn.finance developer Banteg previously highlighted a related issue on the same day the StarkNet airdrop began, noting that the eligibility list seemed to be populated heavily with airdrop squatters. 



These are individuals who target airdrops for financial gain, often manipulating eligibility by controlling multiple or fake accounts. 



Banteg pointed out that around 701,544 of the 1.3 million eligible wallet addresses were potentially linked to such activity, where squatters used repeated or renamed GitHub accounts to increase their chances of receiving airdrops.



In a related revelation from March 2023, it was discovered that airdrop hunters managed to consolidate $3.3 million worth of tokens from the Arbitrum (ARB) airdrop, channeling funds from 1,496 wallets into just two they controlled. 



This pattern underscores the ongoing challenges and exploitative practices within the decentralized finance sector, highlighting the need for continued vigilance and improved security measures to protect legitimate users and their assets.

Ethereum Price Reclaims 100 SMA But Bulls Still Lack Strength To Clear Hurdles


                            Ethereum price started a recovery wave above the $3,000 zone. ETH is now above the 100-hourly simple moving average and facing hurdles.

Ethereum found support at $2,820 and started a recovery wave.
The price is trading above $3,100 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average.
There is a key bullish trend line forming with support at $3,110 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD (data feed via Kraken).
The pair could gain bullish momentum if it clears the $3,165 resistance zone.

Ethereum Price Holds Ground
Ethereum price remained stable and started a recovery wave above the $3,000 level, like Bitcoin. ETH was able to clear the $3,050 and $3,120 resistance levels.
However, the bears were active near the $3,165 resistance zone. A high was formed at $3,168 and the price started a downside correction. There was a minor move below the $3,150 level. The price is now stable above the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the upward move from the $2,813 swing low to the $3,168 high.
Ethereum is also above $3,100 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. Besides, there is a key bullish trend line forming with support at $3,110 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD.

Immediate resistance is near the $3,165 level. The first major resistance is near the $3,200 level. The next key resistance sits at $3,250, above which the price might gain traction and rise toward the $3,350 level. If the bulls remain in action and push the price above $3,350, there could be a drift toward the $3,500 resistance. Any more gains could send Ether toward the $3,620 resistance zone.
Another Decline In ETH?
If Ethereum fails to clear the $3,165 resistance, it could start another decline. Initial support on the downside is near the $3,100 level and the trend line. The first major support is near the $3,000 zone or the 50% Fib retracement level of the upward move from the $2,813 swing low to the $3,168 high.
The main support is near the $2,940 level. A clear move below the $2,940 support might push the price toward $2,820. Any more losses might send the price toward the $2,650 level in the near term.
Technical Indicators
Hourly MACD – The MACD for ETH/USD is losing momentum in the bullish zone.
Hourly RSI – The RSI for ETH/USD is now above the 50 level.

Could stablecoin volumes overtake Visa this quarter?

Stablecoins may finally overtake payment giant Visa in total payment volume this quarter, according to research firm Sacra. Visa's head of crypto, however, disagrees. In a blog post by Sacra co-founder Jan-Erik Asplund, the firm argued that stablecoins’ "extreme product-market fit for cross-border money movement" could see its total payments volume exceed Visa, reaching over $4 trillion. “Stablecoins win on convenience, enabling cross-border payments to be completed any day of the week (rather than business days only), on speed (in minutes rather than 6 to 9 hours), and cost ($0.0037 vs. $12),” Asplund argued. “Today every major bank is working on using stablecoins to run their payment rails behind the scenes,” he added. Source: SacraVisa's head of crypto, Cuy Sheffield, disagrees, arguing there was a “lot of noise” with stablecoin data and that on-chain transactions resulting from interactions with bots and automated programs “don’t resemble settlement in the traditional sense.”Visa's recently launched dashboard claims as much as 90% of stablecoin transactions over the last 30 days are not made by genuine users. There has been around $2.2 trillion in total volume of stablecoin transactions in April. However, less than 10% of that volume or $149 billion, has been classified as genuine by the credit company, with the rest made of bot activity and automated transactions by entities such as centralized exchanges. Visa collaborated with Allium Labs to develop an adjusted stablecoin transaction metric for the dashboard which was announced in late April.“This adjusted metric aims to remove potential distortions that can arise from inorganic activity and other artificial inflationary practices,” states the company on its dashboard. Daily Stablecoin Transaction Volume Adjusted and Unadjusted. Source: Visa/AlliumThe dashboard applies two filters to its stablecoin data: a single directional volume filter that only counts the largest stablecoin amount transferred within a single transaction and an inorganic user filter that aims to remove bot activity and automatic transactions from large entities like centralized exchanges.The dashboard, however, reports that the total monthly stablecoin transaction volume, spurious or otherwise, has almost doubled since the beginning of 2024, the majority of which is Tether (USDT) and Circle’s USD Coin (USDC). Related: Visa, Mastercard could be key drivers for crypto in the year aheadMeanwhile, other payment giants are getting in on the act. PayPal launched its PYUSD stablecoin in 2023 and Stripe said that would allow merchants using its platform to accept stablecoins for online transactions in April. Also in April, Ripple announced plans to launch a USD-backed stablecoin to compete with market leaders. Current stablecoin market capitalization is around $161 billion and daily trading volume is $37 billion, according to CoinGecko. Cointelegraph reached out to Visa and leading stablecoin issuer Tether for further comments but did not receive an immediate response.

Bitcoin's blockchain has processed 1 billion transactions, 15 years after its creation - Crypto Briefing




The Bitcoin network has achieved a significant milestone today by processing its one billionth transaction, marking a momentous occasion in the cryptocurrency’s roughly 15-year history.The milestone was reached on May 5, 2023, at 9:34 pm UTC, when transaction #1,000,000,000 was mined into block 842,241.This landmark event comes 15 years, four months, and four days after Bitcoin’s pseudonymous creator, Satoshi Nakamoto, mined the network’s first block on January 3, 2009. Over the course of its 5,603-day existence, Bitcoin has processed an average of 178,475 daily transactions.Notably, though, this transaction count does not include those made on the Lightning Network, a Bitcoin layer 2 network. The milestone comes at an exciting time for Bitcoin, which has seen heightened levels of daily transactions over the past year as novel protocols like Bitcoin Ordinals and Runes attract more activity to the world’s first blockchain. The launch of spot Bitcoin ETFs has also contributed to bullish sentiment for the token.Daily transactions on Bitcoin spiked around the network’s fourth halving event on April 20, including a record high of 926,000 transactions processed on April 23. Much of this demand can be attributed to the launch of the Runes protocol, a new Bitcoin token standard, at block 840,000. However, Bitcoin’s daily transaction count has since cooled off to 660,260 on May 4.Bitcoin is not the first blockchain to process over a billion transactions though. Ethereum, for instance, has processed well over 2 billion transactions, despite being launched roughly six years after Bitcoin.Bitcoin is currently trading at the $63,700 level, easing into a 12% increase in price rebound since its two-month low of $56,800 on May 2. It is still down by 13.6% from its previous all-time high of $73,740 set on March 13 this year.

Shiba Inu and Dogecoin Rival Crazy Wolf (CRAWOLF) to Surge 7,000% Within Two Days



                    

Crazy Wolf (CRAWOLF) could become a viral memecoin, like Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE).



Crazy Wolf (CRAWOLF), a Solana memecoin that was launched this week, is aiming to challenge other memecoin giants, such as Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE).




Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Crazy Wolf presents a similar opportunity.



The exciting memecoin is poised to rally 7,300% in the coming two days, and Crazy Wolf could potentially reach a multi-million dollar market cap within a few weeks.



Currently, Crazy Wolf can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jupiter and Raydium, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days.




To buy Crazy Wolf on these platforms, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Crazy Wolf by entering its contract address – 4cra6VGCDowfFz3HDz5ctXtCSAhQQ5FEscKMLGzB56ML – in the receiving field.



In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price.



If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner.



The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum.




This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like CRAWOLF.

Bitcoin Hits 1 Billion Transactions Milestone


Bitcoin (BTC), the largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, has marked a significant milestone by processing its one billionth transaction. This achievement highlights the robust activity and growing adoption of Bitcoin despite the fluctuating market conditions.
The Bitcoin community, particularly on social media platforms like X (Twitter), has been abuzz with celebrations. The excitement highlights this milestone’s significance for investors and enthusiasts.
The Road Ahead: Bitcoin After 1 Billion Transactions
On-chain data confirmed this historic moment for Bitcoin. The dashboard from Clark Moody shows that the all-time transaction count on the Bitcoin network has reached 1,000,193,647. Additionally, data from Swan indicates that the 1 billion transaction milestone was achieved at the block height of 842,241.
Glassnode’s recent data points to April 23 as the day with the highest number of Bitcoin transactions in 2024 so far. On that date, 926,842 transactions were recorded when Bitcoin was priced at $66,403. However, the transaction count from the previous day was 625,859, with Bitcoin’s price around $64,000.

Despite this milestone, Bitcoin’s scalability remains a topic of discussion. Crypto analyst Colin Talks Crypto shared his insights. He sees that the challenges and potential scaling issues still remain as Bitcoin continues to grow.
He predicts that Bitcoin’s price might see “euphoric blow off tops,” leading to massive congestion and a significant increase in transaction fees. Such scenarios could make it unaffordable for many to transact. As fees might exceed the balance in over 90% of Bitcoin addresses, making these balances are essentially unspendable.


“It could also mean weeks or even months of waiting for the backlog of transactions to clear from the mempool. This is when I think things have a chance of changing. […] Only when congestion and fees have gotten bad enough that most people are priced out of using the system, will there be enough outcry to finally increase the block size. In my opinion, it could take things getting worse than the 2015-2017 transaction backlog and high fees to cause the shift,” Colin added.

Colin’s perspective highlights a critical debate within the Bitcoin community between ‘big blockers’ and ‘small blockers.’ The big blockers advocate for increasing the block size to handle more transactions and reduce fees. Conversely, the latter resist such changes, focusing on maintaining decentralization and security.
Furthermore, Colin also critiques the effectiveness of the Lightning Network, a proposed solution for Bitcoin’s scalability issues. He suggests that it fails to address core issues at the base layer.
As Bitcoin navigates these challenges, the community remains divided on the best path forward. While some argue for significant protocol changes to enhance scalability, others believe the current infrastructure, including secondary layers like the Lightning Network, will evolve to meet demand. Expected to occur without compromising the foundational principles of Bitcoin, this evolution will maintain the core values of the system.

Amidst the new milestone, Bitcoin’s market performance continues to capture attention. At the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading at $63,805, marking a 0.94% increase over the last 24 hours. This recent uptick follows a climb from below the $60,000 threshold, catalyzed by a favorable US labor report the previous Friday.

However, a new report from Bitfinex suggests a possible period of price stabilization for Bitcoin, which could last up to two months. This forecasted stability might provide a respite for the market, allowing users and developers alike to focus on long-term solutions for scalability and usability.

Investors Sue Coinbase for 'Knowingly' Violating Securities Laws


A group of investors has filed a class-action lawsuit against Coinbase, the popular US-based cryptocurrency exchange. They allege that the company has been offering and selling unregistered securities and investments to its customers.
The lawsuit was filed in the Northern District of California. It names Coinbase Global Inc. and its CEO, Brian Armstrong, defendants.
The Plaintiffs Allege Some Available Tokens on Coinbase as Securities
The plaintiffs allege that Coinbase has operated as an unlicensed broker-dealer since its inception. They also claim it has been offering and selling a wide range of digital assets, considered securities under California law.
The lawsuit lists an extensive list of tokens that are considered digital securities. This includes Algorand (ALGO), Near Protocol (NEAR), Polygon (MATIC), Uniswap (UNI), Solana (SOL), and many others.

Furthermore, the plaintiffs allege that Coinbase “knowingly and willfully” violated California securities laws by failing to register as a broker-dealer and register the securities it offered. Moreover, they claim that Coinbase actively promoted these digital assets through its website, social media, and traditional advertising. Even Super Bowl ads were used to encourage customers to invest in them.

“No use case other than investing was ever offered by Coinbase to the Plaintiffs or the Class (there is no other use case for them) and Coinbase to this day continues to disseminate similar investment bulletins and updates to the Plaintiffs and Class Members. Indeed, the Coinbase website posts a ‘Weekly Market Commentary,’ and as of April 15, 2024, Coinbase still advises that ‘Investors have several ways to gain exposure to the [investment in crypto],’” according to the complaint.


The lawsuit aims for full rescission of all digital asset transactions conducted on the Coinbase platform. Additionally, it calls for injunctive relief and statutory damages.
Notably, this lawsuit comes after the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) took legal action against Coinbase last year. The commission alleges that Coinbase has engaged in selling unregistered securities. The situation escalated in March 2024 when the court rejected Coinbase’s attempt to dismiss the lawsuit, positioning the SEC favorably in this ongoing legal battle.
This new development could have serious repercussions for Coinbase and the crypto industry in general. Coinbase could face significant penalties and damages if found guilty of selling unregistered securities. Additionally, this case could set an important precedent for cryptocurrency regulation in the United States.

It is important to note that the allegations in this lawsuit are just accusations. The crypto exchange has yet to have the opportunity to defend itself in court. However, this lawsuit is a significant challenge for the company and could significantly impact its future.

Giant Economy Country About to Sign Another Ban on Cryptocurrencies, According to Leaked Information - Bitcoin Sistemi


Nigeria, a West African country, is reportedly planning to ban financial institutions from intermediating peer-to-peer (P2P) cryptocurrency transactions.
The move comes as the country's Office of the National Security Adviser (NSA) classified cryptocurrency trading as a national security concern.


According to anonymous sources, three fintech startups known to enable P2P cryptocurrency transactions have been directed to block these transactions and report them to law enforcement. Speculation that Nigeria plans to ban P2P cryptocurrency transactions emerged just weeks after the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) was forced to publicly reject a letter claiming to reverse a decision made on February 5, 2021.
A report from local resource Techcabal revealed that the NSA, which has influenced the country's cryptocurrency transaction policy in recent months, has classified cryptocurrency trading as a national security issue. Tosin Eniolorunda, CEO of fintech startup Moniepoint, said such a definition could indicate that Nigerian authorities are considering banning P2P cryptocurrency transactions.






Eniolorunda also shared his views on why Nigerian authorities want to block P2P transactions. “NSA found a large number of accounts involved in crypto trading and blocked the accounts. They were worried that fintechs were quick to open accounts and told us to stop opening accounts,” said Moniepoint CEO.
Although no date has been specified for the implementation of the ban, an unidentified person quoted in the report claims that the ban is expected to be announced soon.

South Korea stops short of allowing crypto in updated donation laws

Digital currencies have been excluded from newly amended donation legislation in South Korea which could be a blow to the country's charities and donation drives. On May 5, local media outlet Kyunghyang Shinmun reported that the Ministry of Public Administration stated that some amendments to South Korea’s “Donations Act” have been filed but restrict the use of crypto assets for donation.Starting in July, those wishing to donate to charitable organizations or causes will be able to use various new methods such as department store gift vouchers, stocks, and loyalty points from Korean internet giant Naver, but not crypto assets such as Bitcoin (BTC).The act on the collection and use of donated goods was first enacted in 2006 when there were fewer types of payment methods and smartphones were not widespread, it noted. Methods of donation were also expanded from bank transfers and online methods to include automated response systems, postal services, and logistics services.The Ministry didn’t provide reasoning for excluding digital asset donations despite their popularity in South Korea, however, the legislation is set to permit donations in local government-issued, KRW-pegged stablecoins and blockchain-issued gift vouchers.More than $2 billion is estimated to have been donated globally using cryptocurrency as of January 2024, according to TheGivingBlock, a market that local charities would not be permitted to take. Source: TheGivingBlockMeanwhile, across the pond, it was recently reported that more than half of American charities now accept donations in digital assets.

Michael Saylor Celebrates Bitcoin's 1 Billionth Transaction


Michael Saylor, MicroStrategy's executive chairman, has taken to the X social media network to celebrate Bitcoin's latest milestone: one billion transactions.The transaction was recorded in block 842,241 on May 5. at 21:34 UTC, according to the data provided by the Clark Moody dashboard. Roughly 15.5 million transactions have been recorded over the past 30 days. The very first Bitcoin transaction took place on Jan. 12, 2009, between Bitcoin creator Satoshi Nakamoto and the late cypherpunk Hal Finney. Finney received 10 coins as a test. Shortly after that, Finney carried out an email conversation with the mysterious Bitcoin founder in order to report some bugs.    Finney went on to run Bitcoin for some time and later turned it off because it made his computer run hot. The computer programmer was diagnosed with Lou Gehrig's disease shortly after becoming the first person to receive a Bitcoin transaction. After tinkering with Bitcoin and walking away from it, he was surprised to find out that it actually had monetary value in late 2010. The network ended up surpassing one million transactions in July 2011. Back then, the largest cryptocurrency was trading at roughly $15.     Finney, who is one of the leading Satoshi candidates, passed away in 2014 after his battle with Lou Gehrig's disease. In late 2015, Bitcoin recorded 100 million transactions, which was a sign of growing adoption. The largest cryptocurrency was trading at roughly $455. In February 2020, the network topped half a billion transactions when the cryptocurrency was trading just above the $10,000 level.Saylor, one of the most prominent Bitcoin advocates, predicted that the market value of the flagship cryptocurrency could reach $100 trillion.

                        Dogwifhat, Pepe and Dogecoin All Spike As Crypto Market Cap Gains 7% – Is It Time to Buy Meme Coins?In a week marked by a notable 7% gain in the overall crypto market cap, meme coins such as Dogwifhat, Pepe, and Dogecoin have experienced significant spikes.Dogwifhat, currently priced at $3.27, and Pepe at a mere $0.000009, are drawing attention alongside Dogecoin, which has climbed to $0.162.Amidst this upward trend, the recent Sealana presale on the Solana blockchain, securing $237K, signals growing investor interest in emerging meme coins.Dogwifhat Price Prediction: Dogwifhat Soars to $3.27, Eyes Further Gains
Dogwifhat Price Chart – Source: TradingviewDogwifhat, a new cryptocurrency, is trading at $3.27 after a 3.71% dip. It ranks 35th by market cap, valued at over $3.26 billion, with nearly one billion WIF coins in circulation.Analyzing the technical outlook, Dogwifhat’s price hovers near a critical pivot point at $3.50 on the 4-hour chart. This level serves as a fulcrum for potential price movements, with current indicators suggesting a tentative stance among traders.If Dogwifhat sustains above this pivot, it could face immediate resistance levels at $3.87, followed by $4.24 and $4.64. These markers will test the asset’s ability to maintain upward momentum.
Dogwifhat maintains a strong market position with a live market cap exceeding $3.26 billion.
Immediate resistance levels are set just above the current price, with the potential to reach up to $4.64.
Conversely, should it fail to uphold the $3.50 mark, Dogwifhat might retreat towards lower support levels at $2.97, $2.64, and then $2.25, which could stabilize any further price declines. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) is positioned at 69, indicating a slight lean towards overbought conditions but still under the threshold that typically signals a sell-off.This is complemented by the 50-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA) which currently stands at $2.91, underscoring a generally bullish trend over recent weeks.Conclusion: Dogwifhat’s current position suggests the potential for higher climbs if it can robustly hold above its pivot.PEPE Price Prediction: Pepe Reaches $0.000009
Dogwifhat Price Chart – Source: Tradingview
Currently, Pepe’s price prediction is $0.000009. Pepe has seen a slight increase of 0.10% over the last 24 hours, with a robust trading volume of $719 million. This activity places Pepe at 30th in global cryptocurrency rankings, with a market capitalization of $3.58 billion. Pepe’s vast circulating supply is approaching its cap, reflecting the expansive scope of this digital asset.The technical setup on the four-hour chart shows Pepe trading just above the critical pivot point of $0.000008. Should Pepe sustain this level, it faces upcoming resistance at $0.000009, followed by $0.000010 and $0.000011. These markers could potentially guide Pepe toward incremental gains. Conversely, a descent below the pivot point might see Pepe testing support at $0.000007 and, if the downtrend intensifies, at $0.000006.Indicators such as the Relative Strength Index (RSI) at 61 hint at mild buying interest without straying into overextended territory. The 50-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA) stands at $0.00000757, aligning with recent positive sentiment yet underscoring the need for vigilance as prices approach critical thresholds.Dogecoin Price Prediction: DOGE Hits $0.162 Amid Market Optimism
Dogecoin Price Chart – Source: Tradingview
Dogecoin’s price prediction is favourable, trading at $0.161962 with a 24-hour volume of $1.3 billion. It’s up 1.85%, ranking as the eighth most valuable cryptocurrency with a $23.35 billion market cap, showcasing resilience in a volatile crypto market.As we examine the four-hour chart, Dogecoin is currently hovering around a critical pivot point set at $0.15. If it maintains above this threshold, it faces immediate resistance levels at $0.17, followed by $0.19 and $0.21. These levels are crucial for Dogecoin as surpassing them could confirm continued bullish momentum.Conversely, if Dogecoin slips below $0.15, it could encounter successive support levels at $0.14, $0.12, and potentially down to $0.10, signalling a bearish trend reversal. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) is presently at 71, suggesting that Dogecoin might be approaching overbought territory yet still has room for potential price appreciation before hitting critical levels.Additionally, the 50-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA) at $0.14 aligns closely with the current price, reinforcing the $0.15 pivot as a significant indicator of Dogecoin’s short-term direction.Conclusion: Dogecoin’s market stance is cautiously optimistic, pending sustained support above the $0.15 level.Sealana Presale on Solana: $237K Secured, Spotlight on New Meme Coin
Sealana ($SEAL), a unique meme coin inspired by a viral character, rapidly captured the attention of cryptocurrency enthusiasts, amassing $237,271 shortly after its launch. Sealana, crafted in the spirit of the famous Gamer Guy from South Park, represents a quirky twist on the traditional meme coin.Unlike typical canine-inspired tokens, Sealana brings a nautical flair to the blockchain, embodying a character deeply engrossed in finding the next big meme coin on Solana.This character, a humorous nod to internet culture, is portrayed as an overweight seal trading from his messy room, a stark departure from his svelte past, illustrating his commitment to his trade.The presale event allows investors to obtain 6,900 $SEAL tokens for every 1 SOL invested, positioning them advantageously for potential value spikes during the ICO and beyond.Conclusion: Sealana, with its innovative theme and solid backing from Solana, is poised for significant traction in the meme coin market, having raised over $235,000 so far.

                        Coinbase faces a new legal battle as customers filed a class-action lawsuit on Friday. The suit accuses two of the exchange’s subsidiaries — Coinbase Global and Coinbase Asset Management — of repeatedly breaking securities laws since Coinbase began operating.The lawsuit points out certain contradictions in Coinbase’s user agreement. While identifying some crypto assets as securities, Coinbase never registered them for sale, it alleges.Additionally, the lawsuit claims that Coinbase’s admits to acting as a “securities broker” and “securities intermediary.”It also specifically identifies several digital assets listed on Coinbase as “digital asset securities.” These include Algorand (ALGO), Decentraland (MANA), Polygon (MATIC), Near Protocol (NEAR), Uniswap (UNI), and Solana (SOL).Lawsuit Alleges Coinbase Misled Users
“Coinbase recognized early on the significant impact classifying digital assets as securities would have on the operation of the Coinbase Digital Asset Platforms,” the lawsuit states. “And for this reason chose, or was willfully blind, to not register the securities, persons, or broker-dealers as required by state law.”The exchange’s failure to disclose key information is alleged to have amplified deceptive marketing tactics. These tactics, the lawsuit claims, were designed to pressure customers into buying digital asset securities on Coinbase.A Coinbase spokesperson told Cryptonews that “the claims in this litigation are legally baseless.”
.
“We have full faith in the judicial process and look forward to addressing them in full at the appropriate time,” they added.Coinbase Denies Selling Unregistered Securities, Vows Legal Fight
Coinbase is already embroiled in a separate lawsuit with the SEC, which accuses the exchange of violating securities laws. The regulator specifically charged Coinbase with offering and selling unregistered securities through its staking program. Notably, the SEC did not target any Coinbase executives in its lawsuit.Coinbase maintains that secondary sales of crypto assets don’t qualify as securities. The exchange has appealed a judge’s recent decision allowing the SEC lawsuit to proceed.

                        Crypto, “including Bitcoin,” will be excluded from an amended South Korean donations law, government officials announced on May 5.Per Kyunghang Shinmun, the Ministry of the Interior and Safety said it wanted to “expand the scope” of donations – but has decided against allowing citizens to donate crypto.Donations Plans: Crypto Excluded
The ministry plans to make amendments to the Enforcement Decree of the Act on Collection and Use of Donations.These amendments will allow citizens to donate a slew of cash alternatives to charitable causes.These include loyalty points from tech giants such as Naver, as well as department store gift vouchers, securities, supermarket vouchers, and listed stocks.The ministry also plans to let citizens donate local government-issued, KRW-pegged stablecoins and blockchain-powered e-gift vouchers.The scope of donation platforms has also been broadened in the plans, with more online donation options set to be green-lighted.Citizens will also be able to make use of automatic response systems (ARS)-related technology when they want to give to charities.Ministry officials want lawmakers to approve the legal amendments in time for a July rollout.The ministry did not give reasons for its decision not to allow citizens to donate cryptoassets, despite the enormous popularity of BTC and other tokens in the country.The Ministry of the Interior and Safety, South Korea. (Source: MBC News/YouTube)Charities to Suffer?
The news will come as a blow not only to crypto enthusiasts, but also to South Korean charities.In recent years, charities have tried to launch crypto-powered donation drives. But they have had to contend with legal obstacles.South Korean law does not allow for charities to accept crypto donations. So past campaigns have relied almost entirely on the aid of domestic exchanges.In a January 2024 article for Bokji Times, Jang Yoon-ju, a researcher for The Beautiful Foundation – one of South Korea’s biggest charities – documented the crypto-related challenges charities face in the nation.She claimed that potential donors had “made inquiries about cryptocurrency donations.” But, Jang said, such questions were often “difficult to answer.”Exchanges Play Key Role
Jang noted that various attempts to launch crypto-powered donation platforms had failed in the past, with notable drives in 2014 and 2018 eventually coming to nothing.She added that donations made using crypto began “in earnest” in 2020, when four large domestic charitable organizations started encouraging the public to donate their tokens.But in each case, charities have had to team up with crypto exchanges that convert coins to cash, which they they pass on to the organizations.Rising Popularity of Crypto Donations in South Korea?
The researcher added that crypto donations are becoming increasingly popular in South Korea, with many seeking to donate their coins to overseas charities.Jang explained that South Koreans had donated a total of BTC 14 to charities involved in providing aid to victims of the 2023 Turkey–Syria earthquakes.The citizens made their donations via a platform operated by Dunamu, the creator of the South Korean market-leading Upbit exchange.Trading volumes on South Korea’s Upbit crypto exchange over the past 12 months.

1 Billion Hit: Bitcoin Gears Up For The Next Billion Transactions


                            Bitcoin, the trailblazer of cryptocurrencies, reached a symbolic milestone this weekend, processing its 1-billionth transaction. This achievement has ignited a celebratory mood among proponents, who hail it as a testament to the digital currency’s growing legitimacy and potential. However, beneath the champagne toasts, whispers of caution linger as analysts grapple with the true significance of this benchmark.

Bitcoin’s Blockchain Bonanza: Security And Speed Take Center Stage
At the heart of the celebration lies the accomplishment itself. Bitcoin’s decentralized network, often touted for its security, has demonstrably facilitated 1 billion transactions – a testament to its ability to function flawlessly at scale.
This feat, based on data by Clark Moody, is particularly noteworthy when compared to established payment giants like Visa, which took roughly 25 years to reach the same milestone. Proponents like Tarik Sammour emphasize this achievement, highlighting that “Bitcoin has done so flawlessly, securely, and without any centralized intermediary,” a stark contrast to the traditional financial system.

Bitcoin Vs. The Goliaths: Can Crypto Really Compete?
The celebratory mood extends to Bitcoin’s potential as a viable payments platform. Analysts point to the rapid growth of Bitcoin compared to established players like Visa and Mastercard. Founder of the Orange Pill App, Matteo Pallegrini, emphasizes this point, underscoring Bitcoin’s resilience despite facing giants with “billions of dollars in marketing spend and thousands of employees.”
This comparison fuels the narrative that Bitcoin is disrupting the payments landscape, offering a faster and more transparent alternative.

A Look Beyond The Billion: Challenges On The Horizon
While the celebratory chorus is loud, a closer look reveals some lingering concerns. Bitcoin grapples with scalability issues, struggling to handle the high transaction volume necessary to truly compete with traditional payment processors.
This often translates to high transaction fees, potentially hindering broader adoption. Furthermore, the environmental impact of Bitcoin mining, which relies on vast amounts of energy, remains a significant point of contention.

The Verdict: A Toast With Reservations
The 1 billion transaction milestone undoubtedly marks a significant moment for Bitcoin. It underscores the growing popularity and potential of this digital currency. However, a balanced perspective recognizes the challenges Bitcoin faces – scalability, transaction fees, and environmental concerns.

While institutional investment and comparisons to internet adoption are encouraging signs, widespread individual adoption remains a question mark. The future of Bitcoin hinges on its ability to address these issues and evolve into a truly viable alternative in the global financial landscape.

Bitcoin Flashing ‘Chad’ Setup and en Route to Witnessing Best-Case Scenario, Says Top Crypto Analyst - The Daily Hodl


								A crypto analyst who caught the 2022 Bitcoin bottom thinks BTC is close to witnessing a best-case scenario following mostly bearish price action last month.
In a new strategy session, pseudonymous analyst DonAlt tells his 59,200 YouTube subscribers that Bitcoin looks strong after losing $60,000 earlier this month only to recover the key level a few days later.










According to the analyst, the false downside move is a catalyst that could trigger a burst to the upside for BTC.
“That’s just a chad setup. I love those. Almost all the time when I get them where the daily time frame is bearish but the weekly and the monthly are bullish, when that flips you usually make quite a bit of money.”
While DonAlt is bullish on BTC, he doesn’t expect the crypto king to print new all-time highs just yet. The top trader highlights that Bitcoin rallied by over 170% from October to March, and he believes BTC needs more time to “digest” the move before exploding to greater heights.
“This is something I said a couple of weeks ago: the longer this goes sideways, the better for bulls because we’re basically digesting the move that we had. That was a really, really aggressive move. Usually, you have to digest those by just nuking the entire market, but you can also digest it by just going sideways for long enough.
A false breakdown into sideways afterwards would be the best-case scenario I think.
I generally think as long as you reclaim $62,500, that area, and you don’t lose $61,000 again this just looks really, really good.”
At time of writing, Bitcoin is trading for $64,285.

Real Users Account for Less Than 10% of Stablecoin Transaction Volume: Report

Stablecoins are a cryptocurrency tied to another asset class, usually the U.S. dollar, to keep a stable, steady value. They’ve come into sharp focus after PayPal and some others announced they were issuing their stablecoins. Legislation to regulate stablecoins is also seen to be the most likely to make it through the U.S. Congress.

Philippines Set to Unveil Crypto Guidelines in Second Half

                        The Philippines’ securities regulator is set to unveil a regulatory framework for crypto assets and trading by the latter half of 2024.SEC Chair Emilio Aquino announced plans last week to issue the framework by the second half this year, Business World Online reported Monday.The upcoming cryptocurrency guidelines target regulating trading within the Philippines, prioritizing investor protection. This announcement aligns with the SEC’s recent efforts to tighten its grip on unregistered platforms.Last month, the SEC actively pursued removing Binance-linked applications from Apple and Google app stores in the Philippines.“The SEC has identified [Binance] and concluded that the public’s continued access to these websites/apps poses a threat to the security of the funds of investing Filipinos,” SEC Chair Emilio Aquino said in letters to the companies.Philippines Takes Aim at Illegal Crypto Activity with App Removal
Aquino warned that selling unregistered securities and acting as an unlicensed broker in the Philippines is illegal under Republic Act No. 8799, or The Securities Regulation Code. The crackdown on Binance is aimed at stoppoing unauthorized operations in the country.He also reportedly mentioned that the tech giants usually act swiftly on requests to block apps. “I hope it’s fast. We already experienced this with lending apps before. The response is quick. It’s up to them (Google and Apple),” he said.VPNs Pose Challenge for Philippines’ Crypto Crackdown
The regulator further emphasized the importance of proper licensing and registration for trading platforms. He reiterated that Republic Act No. 8799 mandates this compliance before offering securities trading.He also acknowledged the ongoing challenge of users accessing unregistered platforms through virtual private networks (VPNs). While the SEC can’t completely prevent this, Aquino said: “They still can. But nobody gets to blame us. Maybe others might say that we didn’t do anything to stop these apps.”Aquino added that the Philippines SEC is taking lessons from Bahamas-based crypto exchange FTX’s collapse in Nov. 2022, where many Americans were “burned.”

                        For the second month in a row, crypto venture capital funding has exceeded the $1 billion mark, highlighting continued investor interest in the industry.According to data from RootData, April witnessed $1.02 billion in funding spread across 161 investment rounds, slightly down from March’s $1.09 billion across 186 rounds. Nonetheless, this marks the first time since October-November 2022 that the crypto sector has seen two consecutive months of funding surpassing $1 billion.Key Fundraisings in April
Key fundraises in April include a significant $47 million investment led by BlackRock into Securitize, a firm specializing in real-world asset tokenization. Another standout was the massive $225 million investment into Monad, a new layer-1 blockchain often dubbed a “Solana killer,” backed by Paradigm and Coinbase Ventures.Notable injections of capital also went into blockchain infrastructure startup Auradine and Cosmos-based layer-1 blockchain Berachain, receiving $80 million and $100 million, respectively.In terms of sector distribution, blockchain infrastructure firms dominated the funding landscape in 2024, securing $1.7 billion, followed by decentralized finance protocols at $626 million. In contrast, decentralized autonomous organizations received the least funding, with only $3 million so far this year.The momentum in venture capital funding reflects a broader trend of growth within the blockchain industry. With over $3.67 billion already invested across 604 funding rounds in 2024, the year is on pace to exceed the $9.3 billion raised in 2023.Since June 2014, the blockchain industry has seen over $100 billion in funding across 5,195 rounds, according to DeFiLlama.The surge in funding coincides with the ambitions of major VC firms like Pantera Capital and Paradigm, both seeking substantial sums for new cryptocurrency funds. Pantera Capital’s potential $1 billion raise would be the largest in the industry since May 2022 when a16z raised a record $4.5 billion.Interestingly, a16z, while raising $7.2 billion for investments across various sectors including artificial intelligence and gaming, opted not to further bolster its cryptocurrency-focused fund.VC Funding Surges in Q1
VC funding in the crypto space has experienced a surge in the first quarter of 2024, breaking a two-year downtrend.Both the total amount invested and the number of projects receiving VC funding have seen substantial increases since Q4 2023.The data shows a notable 38% rise in funds invested during the quarter, indicating a renewed investor confidence in the crypto industry. Moreover, there has been a remarkable 49% increase in the number of projects securing funding, a level not witnessed since Q4 2021. In total, Web3 startups managed to secure just under $1.9 billion in funding across 346 deals in the first quarter of 2024. This marks a significant 58% increase from the previous quarter, offering a glimmer of hope amidst the lingering downward trajectory of overall crypto VC interest.According to analysts at Bernstein Research, crypto funds could reach a staggering $500 billion to $650 billion within the next five years, a significant leap from the current valuation of approximately $50 billion.

Visa study reveals 90% of stablecoin transactions are done by bots and large-scale traders - Crypto Briefing




A recent study conducted by Visa and Allium Labs suggests that the vast majority of stablecoin transactions are initiated by bots and large-scale traders, not genuine users.The dashboard, designed to isolate transactions made by real people, found that out of approximately $2.2 trillion in total stablecoin transactions in April, only $149 billion originated from “organic payments activity.”The same study said that USDC, the stablecoin issued by Circle, has outpaced Tether’s USDT stablecoin in volume. Notably, on-chain analysis from Nansen revealed that the overall volume for stablecoins have surpassed Visa’s 2023 monthly average.Visa’s study directly challenges the arguments of stablecoin proponents, who claim that these tokens are revolutionizing the payments industry, which is currently valued at $150 trillion.Despite support and optimism from financial technology firms such as PayPal and Stripe, the data suggests that the adoption of these tokens as a genuine payment instrument is still in its early stages.“[…] stablecoins are still in a very nascent moment in their evolution as a payment instrument,” says Pranav Sood, executive general manager for EMEA at payments platform Airwallex.Sood opines that it is possible for stablecoins to have “long-term potential” but its short-term and mid-term focus “needs to be on making sure that existing rails work much better.”Data from Glassnode indicates that the record $3 trillion of total market circulation assigned to digital tokens at the peak of the 2021 bull market was closer to $875 billion in reality, pointing to a gap between nominal and “real” value between digital assets.Glassnode also published a Q2 report in which it claimed that stablecoin network velocity, a measure of how quickly value moves around its network, is nearing 0.2 on an aggregated scale. This means that 20% of the total stablecoin supply is processed in transactions daily.Stablecoin aggregate velocity. Source: Glassnode.The issue of double-counting stablecoin transactions is also a concern. Cuy Sheffield, Visa’s head of crypto, explained that converting $100 of Circle USDC to PayPal’s PYUSD on the decentralized exchange Uniswap would result in $200 of total stablecoin volume being recorded on-chain.Visa, which handled more than $12 trillion worth of transactions last year, is among the companies that could potentially lose out should stablecoins become a widely accepted means of payment. Analysts at Bernstein predicted that the total value of all stablecoins in circulation could reach $2.8 trillion by 2028, an almost 18-fold increase from their current combined circulation.

Crypto Gains Are Not Spent on Luxury, Researchers Unveil - Coin Edition


							

In a recent paper, a group of researchers studied the impact of crypto gains on the American economy.



The study unveils that the crypto gains were not spent on luxurious items but on home purchases, real estate etc.



Researchers posit that crypto gains cannot be compared to a lottery win or gambling.




A recent Bloomberg report spotted a group of researchers who studied the “wealth effect” of cryptocurrencies in the American economy. The researchers identified that the unexpected gains from crypto were not spent on luxury items like Lamborghini, as often narrated on social media.



Notably, researchers like Darren Aiello and Noelle Acheson presented the paper to the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. in March. Darren Aiello, Assistant Professor of Finance at Brigham Young University’s Marriott School of Business, asserted that investors spend their gains in a pattern that resembles traditional equity investments. He stated,




 “If households tend to treat crypto like gambling, then we would expect them to spend their gains in similar ways as lottery winners do. In contrast, our estimates suggest that household spending out of crypto gains is more like the patterns we see from traditional equity investments.” 




The study revealed that the gains of crypto investments couldn’t be compared with lottery wins or gambling. In addition, the researchers asserted that a significant portion of the individuals invested their gains in real estate, leading to a boost in local housing markets in states like California, Nevada, and Utah, where crypto is more popular.



Noelle Acheson, the author of “Crypto Is Macro Now,” highlighted the difference in utilizing crypto gains in different groups. She cited,




 “For lower-income investors placing less priority on wealth preservation, a crypto allocation could be seen as a make-or-break play — more to gain than to lose. So it makes sense that any gains would be spent on big-ticket items such as a house.”




In addition, the researchers discovered that crypto wealth has a remarkable impact on households’ consumption as it surged by about $30 billion in a decade. Unlike the flexes on social media, the money wasn’t spent on Lamborghinis but on home purchases, real estate, etc.

Bitcoin network surpasses 1 billion transactions


The Bitcoin network recorded its one billionth transaction, according to data from Clark Moody’s Bitcoin dashboard.



Bitcoin transactions and their corresponding fees have been a key discussion point among industry participants in recent weeks, in part, due to the introduction of Bitcoin Ordinals and Runes.



The latter, a fungible token protocol launched in tandem with the latest Bitcoin halving last month, raised transaction fees to an all-time record during its debut.



The halving reduces miners’ rewards by 50% roughly every four years, with the latest quadrennial event cutting them from 6.25 Bitcoins to 3.125.

	
	
	
	


Bitcoin is the world’s first blockchain-based cryptocurrency. 



The network’s genesis block was mined by its founder Satoshi Nakamoto in January 2009.



First introduced by the pseudonymous founder as a peer-to-peer payment system, Bitcoin has historically been an inefficient blockchain for tokenized assets such as non-fungible or fungible tokens when compared to other networks like Solana or Ethereum.



The introduction of Bitcoin Ordinals brought a new wave of tokenized assets onto the network by inscribing data onto satoshis, the smallest unit of Bitcoin, allowing a rendition of NFTs to exist on the network.

	
	
	

	


With the launch of Runes, primarily used for memecoins today, fungible tokens can potentially introduce new possibilities to the network, such as expanded applications for decentralized finance.

Hong Kong's Bitcoin ETFs May Open To Mainland Chinese


								Richard Byworth, Managing Partner at SyzCapital, has ignited rumors suggesting that Bitcoin ETFs listed in Hong Kong could soon be accessible to investors from mainland China. Byworth’s remarks on X, formerly known as Twitter, highlight the ongoing discussions about the possibility of the integration of these ETFs into the Stock Connect system. This integration could pave the way for a massive wave of capital inflow from the mainland into these digital asset funds.
Byworth stated, “I just got back from Hong Kong. There is talk that the ETF could be added to stock connect. The implications for this are absolutely enormous (basically means mainland money can buy it)”. This statement followed a dialogue initiated by Samson Mow, who commented on the impressive initial performance of the ChinaAMC Bitcoin ETF, which gathered $121 million on its first trading day.
Bitcoin ETF In Hong Kong To Open For Mainland Chinese?
Mow’s statement, “I think you guys should be a little more bullish,” reflects an optimistic outlook on the future of Bitcoin ETFs in Hong Kong. Adding depth to the discussion, Brian HoonJong Paik, Co-founder & COO at SmashFi, expressed his views on the financial and socio-economic motivations that could drive mainland Chinese interest towards Hong Kong’s Bitcoin ETFs.

He highlighted the vast amount of Chinese wealth locked in real estate, with approximately 100 million empty homes, pointing to a dire need for alternative investment opportunities to stabilize the socio-economic landscape. “It’s just a matter of time. The CCP needs an alternative asset to mitigate social unrest,” Paik stated.
Paik also tackled the widespread misconception that investors from mainland China are currently restricted from investing in ETFs available on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange. He explained that several existing financial arrangements already facilitate a robust flow of mainland capital into Hong Kong’s markets.
The Shanghai-Hong Kong Stock Connect and the Shenzhen-Hong Kong Stock Connect are prominent examples, allowing investors to trade stocks across the border, albeit regulated by a daily transaction quota.
Further, the Qualified Domestic Institutional Investor (QDII) scheme permits Chinese institutional investors to participate in overseas markets, including those in Hong Kong. Additionally, Chinese residents have the option to invest through brokerage firms that operate legally in both territories, navigating the complex regulatory landscape that governs foreign investments.

Another critical framework, the Mutual Recognition of Funds (MRF) between Hong Kong and Mainland China, facilitates the distribution of eligible mutual funds in each other’s markets through a streamlined approval process. According to Paik, excluding Bitcoin ETFs from these arrangements would likely provoke significant discontent and could disrupt the investment landscape in both regions.
“These mechanisms make the Hong Kong stock market one of the most accessible foreign markets for Chinese investors, promoting financial integration between the Mainland and Hong Kong. Excluding only the Bitcoin ETF would likely cause significant repercussions among both institutional and retail investors in both China and Hong Kong,” he stated.
Notably, Singapore-based Matrixport already projected in mid-April that the approval and subsequent inclusion of Hong Kong-listed Bitcoin Spot ETFs into the Southbound Stock Connect could attract $25 billion of capital. This program facilitates up to 500 billion RMB ($70 billion) per year in transactions.

AVAX Price Uptrend To Continue? These Could Be The Factors To Watch


                            AVAX price is gaining pace above the $36.50 resistance. Avalanche could rise further if there is a clear move above the $40.00 resistance zone.

AVAX price is moving higher from the $30.50 support zone against the US dollar.
The price is trading above $35.00 and the 100 simple moving average (4 hours).
There was a break above a key bearish trend line with resistance at $34.00 on the 4-hour chart of the AVAX/USD pair (data source from Kraken).
The pair could continue to rise if it stays above the $36.30 and $35.50 support levels.

AVAX Price Aims Higher
After a steady decline, Avalanche’s AVAX found support near the $30.50 zone. A low was formed near $30.58, and the price started a fresh increase, like Bitcoin and Ethereum.
The price gained over 10% and broke many hurdles near $35.00. There was a break above a key bearish trend line with resistance at $34.00 on the 4-hour chart of the AVAX/USD pair. The pair even cleared the 50% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $39.83 swing high to the $30.58 low.
AVAX price is now trading above $36.50 and the 100 simple moving average (4 hours). On the upside, an immediate resistance is near the $37.65 zone or the 76.4% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $39.83 swing high to the $30.58 low.

Dips Supported in Avalanche?
If AVAX price fails to continue higher above the $37.65 or $39.80 levels, it could start a downside correction. Immediate support on the downside is near the $36.30 level.
The main support is near the $35.20 zone and the 100 simple moving average (4 hours). A downside break below the $35.20 level could open the doors for a major decline towards $32.80. The next major support is near the $30.50 level.

Jack Dorsey leaves board of decentralized social network Bluesky

Twitter co-founder Jack Dorsey has left Bluesky’s board — the decentralized social media platform he conceived and funded in 2019 when he was Twitter’s CEO.Bluesky confirmed Dorsey’s exit in a May 5 post on the platform, writing that it was “searching for a new board member” and thanked Dorsey for his help in starting and funding the project.Hours earlier, Dorsey had responded with a curt “no” to someone on X asking if he was still on Bluesky’s board. Neither Bluesky nor Dorsey explained why he decided to leave. Bluesky did not immediately respond to a request for comment.Source: BlueSkyMeanwhile, the early Bluesky backer was busy on X plugging his grants for open interest protocols and calling the now Elon Musk-owned social network “freedom technology.”Source: Jack DorseyTech sector executive social activity tracking X account Big Tech Alert posted that Dorsey had unfollowed “well over 2000 people,” parsing his follow list down to three people: Musk, Stella Assange — wife of imprisoned WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange — and NSA contractor-turned-whistleblower Edward Snowden.Related: Decentralized social networks have a retention problem, say execsDorsey keeping Musk on his follow list and the endorsement of X suggests the two may have made amends.In April 2023, Dorsey took to Bluesky to lambast Musk, saying he was running X poorly and the board shouldn’t have forced the sale to him, according to TechCrunch.Dorsey announced Bluesky in late 2019 when he was Twitter’s CEO, posting that the firm was “funding a small independent team of up to five open source architects, engineers, and designers to develop an open and decentralized standard for social media.”Bluesky didn’t launch in beta until March 2023 and only opened to everyone on Feb. 7, 2024.

                        Bitcoin has officially processed over one billion transactions since its inception.According to data published on Clark Moody Bitcoin, this landmark was reached on May 5, when transaction number 1,000,000,000 was recorded. The transaction was included in block 842,241.
This achievement comes 15 years after the Bitcoin network went live on Jan. 3, 2009, taking a total of 5,602 days or roughly 800 weeks. The blockchain would see an average of 178,507 transactions per day.Bitcoin Gains New Ground in 2024
The year of 2024 has been a critical year for the leading crypto. In January, the spot bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) were approved in the United States, followed by the recent launch of similar products in Hong Kong, marking the first of its kind in Asia.In April, the fourth Bitcoin halving took place. It reduced the Bitcoin mining rewards by half, bringing it down from 6.25 BTC per block to 3.125 BTC.Due to the popularity of Bitcoin ETFs, the pre-halving hype, and the potential impact of U.S economy, the first cryptocurrency witnessed its all-time-high on March 24, 2024. CoinGecko recorded a trading price of $73,737.94, breaking the previous historical highs.Over the past 30 days, the crypto experienced significant fluctuations. BTC price dropped from the $70,000 level and saw a recent bearish period trading below $60,000. It is currently trading at $64,222, marking 1.2% up within the past 24 hours.GBTC Records First Net Inflows in 78 Dyas

Bitcoin Hits 1 Billion Transaction Milestone 10 Years Faster Than Visa


							

The Bitcoin blockchain network has processed its one-billionth transaction.



An analyst pointed out that the accomplishment surpasses Visa’s timeline by a decade.



Industry experts anticipate accelerated adoption as institutions enter the BTC market.




The premier crypto blockchain network, Bitcoin (BTC), has processed its one-billionth transaction. According to Clark Moody’s Bitcoin data, this milestone was reached on Sunday, May 5. The event comes when Bitcoin’s price shows signs of stabilization, hovering around the $64,000 mark.



Prominent figures in the Bitcoin community, including former Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey, have marked this development. 







Tarik Sammour, an associate professor at the University of Adelaide, South Australia, also reacted to the Bitcoin milestone. Sammour emphasized that the Bitcoin network processed 1 billion transactions flawlessly, securely, and without any centralized intermediary.



Meanwhile, other market commentators have leveraged the opportunity to draw attention to Bitcoin’s performance compared to traditional payment networks. Matteo Pallegrini, the founder of the Orange Pill App, highlighted that Bitcoin reached this milestone in a mere 15 years, a feat that took Visa 25 years to accomplish. 







However, the Alpha Beta Soup YouTube channel host disagreed with Pallegrini’s comparison with Visa. He pointed out that Visa was established in 1958 during an analog era. He highlighted that even online consumer banking did not emerge until 1994.



In rebuttal, Pallegrini highlighted that Visa enjoyed a monopoly until the 1970s. On the other hand, Bitcoin competes with hundreds of payment companies such as Visa, Mastercard, PayPal, Venmo, and Alipay, among others. Pallegrini underscored the billions of dollars in marketing expenditures in this competitive landscape, whereas Bitcoin has no such.









Notably, the crypto community anticipates that Bitcoin’s adoption curve will steepen significantly from its present trajectory, especially with the new involvement of institutions through Bitcoin spot ETF.Renowned Bitcoin analyst Willy Woo shared data suggesting that Bitcoin’s adoption rate is only 4.7%, akin to the internet’s adoption in January 1999. This comparison implies that, although Bitcoin is gaining traction, it remains in the early phase of its adoption journey.

Cardano: Forget $1, ADA is in danger of falling to $0.40 - AMBCrypto



The Elliot Wave showed that ADA had slipped below the crucial support.
Signals from the liquidation levels and OI predicted a decrease to $0.42.

More Crypto Online, a crypto channel, disclosed that Cardano’s [ADA] bottom was not yet in, and another decline could be close.
According to the session posted on YouTube, the anchor noted that the Elliot Wave confirmed the signal.
Explaining the thesis, the channel mentioned that,
“We have seen only a 3-wave corrective rally. These are typically not bullish and ADA might break down or movie sideways.”
Sellers are on the offensive side
The Elliot Wave is a technical theory that looks at recurrent price patterns. This way, traders can catch the tops and bottoms of a cycle.
However, More Crypto Online mentioned that ADA’s breakdown below the $0.48 support implied that any bullish bias has been invalidated.
Therefore, the price could slide down Wave 5 which could signal a large degree of downswing. Should this happen, the price of the Cardano native token might slide to $0.42.
As of this writing, ADA’s price was $0.45. This was a 2% decrease in the last 24 hours.
Previously, AMBCrypto reported how the token was showing signs that mirrored its incredible rally in the last 24 bull market.
But if this recent theory holds water, that prediction could be set back. However, technical data alone would not cut it for Cardano. Hence, we checked out the potential of the cryptocurrency from an on-chain angle.
First off, AMBCrypto looked at the Open Interest (OI). For context, OI refers to the sum of all open positions connected to a contract in the derivatives market.
Source: Santiment
An increase in the indicator implies an increase in net positioning. It could also imply that buyers (read longs) are aggressive.
However, Cardano’s OI was $548.6 million at press time— a decrease from the value seven days ago.
The inference in this case is that sellers (shorts) are the aggressive ones. If this decline goes unchecked, the prediction of $0.42 could be validated.
Will ADA move to $0.42?
Besides the OI, we also analyzed the liquidation levels and CLLD. CLLD stands for Cumulative Liquidation Levels Delta (CLLD). Liquidation levels predict price levels where price large liquidations might occur.
With this metric, traders can decide whether to go long or short. For the CLLD, its positive value indicates more long liquidations. On the other hand, negative values of the CLLD suggest more short liquidations.

Read Cardano’s [ADA] Price Prediction 2024-2025

From the chart below, there was no magnetic zone that could attract a rise in Cardano’s price. But the CLLD was positive, indicating a looming full retrace for Cardano.
Source: Hyblock
Therefore, this bearish bias could restrict ADA from starting an upside movement. For the time being, the price of the token could drop to $0.40. This might be the target in a highly bearish situation.

Legal Storm Brews For Coinbase: Lawsuit Claims Deceptive Practices


								Coinbase, a leading cryptocurrency exchange, finds itself embroiled in a multi-front legal war. From disgruntled investors to the watchful eye of the SEC, the company faces challenges that threaten its operations and cast a shadow over the future of crypto regulation.

Coinbase Accused Of Selling Unregistered Securities
A new class-action lawsuit filed in California alleges Coinbase knowingly violated state securities laws by selling unregistered securities. The plaintiffs, a group of investors, target specific tokens like Solana and Uniswap, arguing they should be classified as investments and not mere digital assets.
They point to a possible contradiction within the exchange’s own user agreement, which may define the company as a “Securities Broker.” This lawsuit echoes a similar one already underway, suggesting a growing trend of investor discontent with Coinbase’s crypto offerings.

Coinbase Vs. SEC: A Battle For Regulatory Clarity
The most prominent legal fight involves the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). The SEC accuses Coinbase of acting as an unregistered securities exchange and broker by offering unregistered tokens. The company vehemently denies these charges and has filed an appeal against the initial ruling.
This clash highlights the core issue: the lack of clear regulations governing cryptocurrency. Coinbase, along with many in the industry, views this lawsuit as an overreach by the SEC, pushing for a more defined regulatory framework that fosters innovation without stifling growth.

Bitcoin is now trading at $64.493. Chart: TradingView
John Deaton Joins The Fray
Adding another layer of intrigue is the involvement of John Deaton, a prominent crypto lawyer known for his advocacy against regulatory overreach. Deaton has filed an amicus brief in support of Coinbase in the SEC battle.
This move signifies the industry’s unified front against what they perceive as stifling regulations. Deaton’s pro bono work highlights the high stakes involved, not just for the crypto exchange, but for the entire crypto ecosystem.
Beyond The SEC: GYEN And Staking Programs Face Scrutiny
Coinbase’s legal woes extend beyond the SEC lawsuit. A separate case accuses the exchange of mishandling the GYEN stablecoin, a cryptocurrency pegged to the Japanese Yen. Plaintiffs allege that the firm promoted and traded GYEN despite knowing of its volatility, leading to significant investor losses.

Additionally, the company’s staking program, which allows users to earn rewards by holding crypto, has drawn the attention of regulators. The SEC views staking as an unregistered security, while several US states have joined the case, further complicating the legal landscape for Coinbase.

Dogecoin Price Prediction: Is a Massive DOGE Price Rally in the Making?


																TL;DR

DOGE spikes approximately 15% weekly, nearing $0.17, as analysts predict a bullish trajectory fueled by breaking multi-year resistance and increased transaction volume.
Some foresee DOGE’s potential to reach $1, drawing parallels to previous price corrections followed by significant surges.


DOGE Enters a New Bullish Trend?
The revival of the cryptocurrency market has been more than evident in the past few days, with Bitcoin (BTC) reclaiming the $64,000 mark and Ethereum (ETH) climbing above $3,100. However, one digital asset witnessed even more impressive gains, and that is Dogecoin (DOGE).
The price of the biggest meme coin by market capitalization is up approximately 15% on a weekly scale, inching towards $0.17.
DOGE Price, Source: CoinGecko

According to many analysts, the latest pump has established a predominantly bullish environment for DOGE, meaning its value could rise much more substantially in the following months.
One person to support that thesis is the X user Rekt Capital. The trader, who has almost half a million followers on the social media platform, claimed that Dogecoin “flipped a multi-year resistance into new support,” resulting in a “new Macro Uptrend.”




Crypto Catalysts was even more bullish, highlighting the meme coin’s increased daily transaction volume, “reclaiming weekly level,” and other positive factors. The X user assumed that DOGE’s path to the milestone of $1 is clear. 
Previous DOGE Forecasts
One crypto analyst who also chipped in lately is Ali Martinez. The X user remained unfazed by the market decline last week and DOGE’s plummeting price, maintaining that the asset’s retreat could be “part of its usual behavior before massive bull runs.”
He noted several occasions in the past years when the meme coin’s price dipped before soaring significantly. The first case was in 2017 when DOGE retraced by 40% before exploding by almost 1,000%.
The situation repeated four years later, with the token’s valuation nosediving by 56% but later skyrocketing by a whopping 12,000%, reaching an all-time high of almost $0.70.
“Now, in 2024, DOGE has yet again broken out of a descending triangle! It is currently undergoing a 47% price correction, very similar to previous cycles, which could ignite the next DOGE bull run,” Ali Martinez concluded.

How and where to view crypto transaction histories

Each transaction on the blockchain incurs a transaction fee based on a tiered pricing structure, meaning fees are determined by transaction size or network activity levels. These fees can vary significantly, making it important to monitor crypto transactions closely. A user can identify patterns and develop strategies to minimize costs by analyzing transaction history. Viewing transaction history can help with tracking and transaction analysis.A cryptocurrency holder can perform transaction tracking in various ways, such as utilizing the search function on a blockchain explorer. This article provides a step-by-step guide on checking crypto transaction logs and where to find the historical data, which is crucial for transaction analysis.Where to check crypto transactions historyUsers can employ several strategies for transaction viewing: 1. Blockchain explorerBlockchain explorers are blockchain-specific, meaning they only work with the particular blockchain they’re designed for. A blockchain explorer is a tool that reveals records on the crypto ledger.Most explorers are open to the public, enabling the viewing of all transactions initiated and completed on a blockchain network. Each entry contains transaction details, such as the amount, timestamp and the sender and receiver’s address.Blockchain explorers have an intuitive user interface (UI), allowing users to search for all transactions, blocks, wallet addresses and digital asset history. It keeps track of all cryptocurrency records, enabling the confirmation of transaction status, block and wallet balance. A blockchain explorer can help diagnose a transaction or wallet balance issue.Examples of cryptocurrency explorers include:btcscan.org/ - Bitcoinetherscan.io - Ethereumsolscan.io - Solanalive.blockcypher.com/ltc/ - Litecoinbithomp.com/explorer - XRPA user can use the explorer to verify the transaction history details of a wallet by entering the wallet’s address in the explorer’s search bar. This method is also effective for a cold wallet, which is not connected to the internet, by first securely accessing the address of the cold wallet to search for its transaction history. Before using this functionality, taking appropriate security measures to protect your funds and private keys is crucial.2. Crypto walletIf the searcher used a wallet to transfer tokens, they can use its cryptocurrency records to access the transaction history. A wallet records all the registered incoming and outgoing transactions in the history section of the wallet. Click any transaction to view its details.3. Third-party servicesSome third-party platforms can offer insights into transaction histories as they can provide a feed of all transactions. These platforms have a user-friendly interface that displays aggregated data from a blockchain.Most third-party platforms allow users to view transactions on desktops or smart devices. They allow users to filter transactions using parameters, such as the amount, date and transaction or token type, presenting the results in an easy-to-understand format.Similarly, the cryptocurrency market has plenty of crypto wallet tracker tools that help track wallet transactions. By entering the search query, a user will gain access to transaction history, investment patterns and potentially some wallet-holder information (if the network allows for reduced anonymity). 4. Downloading the entire blockchainExpert users can download the entire blockchain history by running a full node. This gives them offline access to local searches rather than relying on online resources. However, running a full archival node can be resource-intensive and requires significant storage space. For instance, it is not unusual for the node to require 340 gigabytes of space the first time a user runs it.How to view crypto transaction history on a blockchain explorerUsers may follow these steps when using a blockchain explorer to view transaction history:Step 1: Go to the search field on the blockchain explorer.Step 2: Enter the details of the crypto transaction. The explorer allows users to search by different parameters like the sender’s or receiver’s address, transaction ID, transaction date or the block hash where the transaction data is stored.If the results do not display after entering the search query, click “search” or the search button to start the search.Step 3: If the user enters the right transaction details on the search bar, they will receive a result or a list of the possible results that could match the transaction under search.To find a particular transaction, enter the exact details of the transaction, such as the transaction hash or the exact amount sent.Step 4: Click on the desired transaction to enter the transaction page, which provides further details about the transaction. View or download/export the transaction(s) for analysis, or copy a transaction ID and send it to anyone needing proof. How to utilize a blockchain explorer to view wallet historyInstead of logging into a wallet to view transaction history, a user can follow these steps to view the transaction history of a crypto wallet:Step 1: Go to the search bar of a blockchain explorer.Step 2: Enter the exact wallet address on the search bar. It’s preferable to copy-paste the address from the wallet app to avoid errors. Click the “search” or search button.N/B: Ensure the wallet under search is compatible with the blockchain explorer.Step 3: The search results will display the entire digital currency history and the assets present in the wallet. View the different categories, including analytics and public comments on the wallet.How to use wallet activity to view transaction historyThe multichain Exodus wallet is used for illustrative purposes to access wallet transaction history:Step 1: After logging into Exodus, click the wallet icon.Step 2: Locate and click the portfolio button. Users with multiple portfolios should click the corresponding portfolio for which they want to view the transaction history. Those with only one portfolio should skip to step 3.Step 3: Click the profile button at the bottom. Select the history button to view historical transactions. Step 4: To narrow the search, click the “All” drop-down menu to filter the transactions using options like sent, received or exchanged transactions.Step 5: Click on a transaction to view its details.How to use third-party services to view the transaction historyThe Exodus platform will be used to illustrate the use of third-party services for accessing blockchain history:Step 1: Click/tap the “History” icon on the Exodus desktop or mobile app. Users should click/tap the portfolio they want to view. If users do not have multiple portfolios, they should skip to the next step.Step 2: Filter the results using the “All assets” drop-down menu. The drop-down menu lets users filter results by sent, received and swapped categories. This assists in narrowing down the results, making it easier to locate particular transactions.Step 3: Click any individual transaction to scrutinize its details.Viewing transaction histories by downloading a blockchainThe Bitcoin network will be used for illustrative purposes.Step 1: Start the initial block download (IBD) process, which involves downloading the entire blockchain and then verifying the blocks. Although the installation process provides a wallet, it only stores and records transactions after installation.Step 2: Open the Bitcoin blocks subdirectory to view transaction history. Note that it will show all Bitcoin transactions, not just the users’.Since the transactions are indecipherable as they are .dat files, build or link a wallet interface/a web front end that installs a blockchain explorer UI. The wallet or explorer will visually represent the data, making it easier to understand.Step 3: If the user installed the wallet or blockchain explorer interface, follow the steps provided in the wallet and explorer sections above to view transaction histories.How to find lost crypto transactionsFor an investor, tracking out misplaced or lost cryptocurrency transactions can be a tedious experience. The first thing to do is to review existing records in detail. This includes looking through a cryptocurrency wallet’s transaction history, reviewing exchange statements to look for missing transactions, and looking through emails to find confirmations from exchanges or wallets. The transaction can be tracked using a blockchain explorer for the relevant cryptocurrency if a fragment of the transaction hash or wallet address is known. If investors need help finding the lost transaction history, they may also contact their exchange support or wallet provider. Specialized data recovery services for lost cryptocurrency transactions are also available; however, they should be utilized cautiously because they may involve costs, and scams are unfortunately prevalent in this area. Furthermore, to prevent the headache of lost transactions, investors should diligently maintain organized wallet histories, save all exchange statements, and archive any emails or bank statements related to their cryptocurrency transactions.

FHE: The Future of Encrypted Data Processing? Buterin's Resurface Raises Hopes


							

Vitalik Buterin reignites interest in FHE, encryption tech for calculations on encrypted data.



FHE’s potential applications include secure cloud computing and privacy-preserving data analysis.



Challenges remain for FHE, such as computational cost and security vulnerabilities.




Vitalik Buterin, the co-founder of Ethereum, has ignited fresh interest in a revolutionary encryption technology called Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE). Buterin recently resurfaced a 2020 article he authored titled “Exploring Fully Homomorphic Encryption,” prompting discussions about the tech’s potential to transform data security.







FHE’s unique selling point is that It allows users to perform calculations on encrypted data without ever decrypting it. This opens a world of possibilities for data privacy.



Buterin’s re-promotion of the article occurred because of the fresh interest of the public around FHE’s practical applications. This could be a game-changer for several sectors. Cloud computing could become significantly more secure as sensitive data could be processed in the cloud while remaining encrypted. 



According to Buterin’s article, while FHE’s potential is undeniable but challenges still remain. The computations performed on encrypted data can be computationally expensive and impacting processing speeds. Additionally, FHE is a new technology which requires further research to optimize performance and address security vulnerabilities.









However, Buterin’s focus on FHE gives optimism to the crypto community for the future of data security and privacy. Additionally, Vitalik’s article states that as FHE matures, its applications could extend far beyond the initial areas of interest shaping the way we handle sensitive data in an increasingly cloud-reliant world.



Vitalik has always been one for the safety measures, the founder recently revealed that 90% of his crypto is held in Multi-Sig Service. In a multi-signature solution, users hold some keys but are unable to recover the funds independently. A multi-sig solution is recommended to minimize the personal risks associated with hardware wallets.

This is Why MakerDAO Sold $31.20 Million in MKR


MakerDAO has recently executed substantial sales of its governance token, MKR. According to the on-chain analytical platform Spot On Chain, MakerDAO’s Multisign 0xbba deposited a significant 750 MKR, valued at $2.19 million, to Binance. This transaction happened through a middle wallet – 0x1cc at a price of $2,920.
This action is part of a broader trend that has garnered attention within the industry. 
Price Impact on MKR
Spot On Chain observed that since its resurgence on March 18, 2024, the multisign has consistently deposited MKR tokens. The deposits total a staggering 11,993 MKR, valued at $31.18 million at an average price of $3,184. These deposits often precede a price drop, indicating a strategic approach to managing market movements.
During this period, a notable transfer involved 9,043 MKR, amounting to $29.75 million, which flowed from Wintermute Trading OTC to various centralized exchanges (CEXs) like Binance, Coinbase, and Kraken between March 18 and April 22. Additionally, 2,950 MKR, valued at $8.43 million, was directly deposited into Binance via the intermediary wallet 0x1cc in the last 11 days.

Despite these transactions, the multisign still retains a substantial 18,978 MKR, worth over $60 million.
This flurry of activity coincides with MakerDAO’s plans to introduce two new tokens – NewStable (NST) and NewGovToken (NGT). NST, an upgraded version of Dai, promises enhanced stability features for broader adoption. On the other hand, NGT represents a revamped governance model aimed at fostering wider participation and dynamic decision-making within MakerDAO’s ecosystem.
Dai holders can seamlessly upgrade to NST, while MKR holders can convert each MKR into 24,000 NGT, promoting broader engagement in governance activities.


“These additions represent an expansion and will not replace the existing Dai (DAI) and Maker (MKR) tokens. Users will have the option to transition to NewStable and NewGovToken,” MakerDAO wrote.

Despite recent market fluctuations that saw MKR dip by approximately 28% from its April highs, there are indications of a potential reversal. 
Technical analysis points to the formation of a bullish cup and handle pattern, with a breakout from the neckline potentially pushing prices up by nearly 14% to $3327. However, failure to breach this level could see support forming around $2,700.

Grayscale Bitcoin Trust Sees Positive Inflow After 11 Weeks, Sparking Optimism for BTC Price
On the other side, the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) finally experienced a positive gain of $63 million after 11 straight weeks of outflows. This shift comes amid strong competition from spot Bitcoin ETFs that have gained popularity since January, impacting GBTC’s market position. Despite recent losses, GBTC remains the largest Bitcoin spot ETF with $18.7 billion in assets and around 297,000 bitcoins. Meanwhile, the BlackRock iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) holds $17.2 billion. To regain ground, Grayscale proposes a “mini” Bitcoin ETF with lower fees. This positive news for Grayscale surprised the market, with some analysts expressing astonishment at GBTC’s turnaround.











Thus, the positive inflow into the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust ETF (GBTC) signalled renewed investor interest and confidence, contributing to upward pressure on the BTC price amidst competition from spot Bitcoin ETFs.













Bitcoin‘s current pivot point stands at $64,655, keeping bitcoin price prediction bearish under this level and bullish above this. Should Bitcoin surpass this level, it will encounter resistance at $67,084, followed by $69,356, and $71,309.

Conversely, support levels are identified at $61,531, $59,164, and $56,677, which will be crucial if the downward pressure persists. 
The Relative Strength Index (RSI) is currently at 61, indicating neither overbought nor oversold conditions, while the 50-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA) at $61,652 could offer additional support. 
The market sentiment is bearish below $64,655, but crossing above this could shift to a more bullish outlook.

Bitcoin: good news for Grayscale's ETF

Good news for Bitcoin came over the weekend from Grayscale’s ETF. 
Indeed, quite unexpectedly, on Friday, May 3rd, there were recorded 63 million dollars of inflows towards the world’s largest Bitcoin ETF. 


The latest news on Bitcoin: Grayscale ETF outflows 
Since it was transformed into an ETF on January 11, 2024, the Grayscale fund on Bitcoin has recorded a long consecutive series of outflows.
It is enough to say that on January 10th he owned about 620,000 BTC, while now he only owns a little over 290,000, which is less than half. 
The outflows began on the very day of the stock market debut in the form of ETFs, so much so that already the next day they were forced to liquidate more than 2,300 BTC. 
Since then, practically during all daily stock market sessions, outflows had occurred, with a peak on January 23 followed the next day by a single daily liquidation of almost 16,000 BTC. 
Starting from the end of January, outflows began to decrease, reaching a first minimum peak at the end of February. However, at that minimum peak, a daily liquidation of more than 400 BTC followed. 
At the beginning of March, daily settlements returned above 9,000 BTC, only to drop below 300 BTC on April 11th. 
Since then, daily settlements have followed every day, ranging from 400 to 3,000 BTC. 
The trend reversal
No one expected this trend to reverse. 
It was expected that, as investors exited the Grayscale ETF to move to other more convenient ETFs, outflows would decrease, as indeed happened, but that there could be a net daily inflow at some point in this phase seemed really unlikely. 
For example, on Friday, May 3rd, Grayscale’s ETF had still liquidated more than 900 BTC due to outflows from the previous day. And the day before, it had liquidated almost 3,000 in one go. 
The influx on Friday, which has not yet been followed by a purchase of BTC due to the weekend break, was a real bolt from the blue. 
In fact, the crypto markets reacted well to the news, which was released on Saturday morning when traditional stock exchanges were already closed for the weekend. 
Actually, already on Friday evening the price of Bitcoin had risen with a single leap from $59,000 to about $62,000, but for other reasons. Also during the day on Friday it had risen up to $63,000.
On Saturday, however, it reached up to $64,500, both due to the positive news regarding Grayscale’s ETF, and simply continuing the upward trend started the day before. 
Between yesterday and today, however, the price has remained stable at around $64,000. 
The other ETFs
It should not be forgotten that while Grayscale’s ETF liquidated almost 330,000 BTC in less than four months, the other new ETFs landed on the stock exchange on January 11 acquired more than 500,000.
So it was not at all a flight of investors from ETFs on Bitcoin, but only a shift from an ETF with high costs (Grayscale’s GBTC) to others with much lower costs.
Indeed, overall, the Bitcoin ETF sector has attracted a lot of net capital inflows in recent months, ending up acquiring about 200,000 net BTC, including the 330,000 liquidated by GBTC. 
Furthermore, last Tuesday some ETFs on Bitcoin and Ethereum also made their debut on the Hong Kong stock exchange, although it was not a great success.
However, with the launch in Hong Kong on April 30th, perhaps one phase has ended and another has begun. 
Actually, one had already been concluded by the end of January, but the first two phases had been completely dominated by American markets. 
The point now is that a second phase may have started in which Chinese markets could also play an important role. 
At this moment, Chinese markets from this point of view are still playing only a very marginal role, to the point of being almost irrelevant, but they have started a process that could also assume considerable dimensions in the medium to long term. 
Chinese residents who do not reside in Hong Kong, who are the vast majority, are still precluded from accessing Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs.
However, if this process started on April 30th were to conclude, as many believe, with the total opening of these products to all Chinese, China could become the second market in the world after the USA, playing a very significant role.
In such a scenario, it is not surprising at all that in recent days the crypto markets are reacting well to the news coming from the world of ETFs.

Bitcoin surpasses one billion transactions in its 15-year history

The Bitcoin Blockchain has surpassed one billion transactions processed after 15 years of its history. The transaction count does not include those processed on the Lightning Network. 

Bitcoin: one billion transactions after 15 years of its history
On May 5, 2024, after 15 years of its history, the Bitcoin Blockchain has surpassed one billion transactions.

“#Bitcoin has officially processed over 1 billion transactions.”
According to the data reported in the video, the billionth transaction processed on the Bitcoin Blockchain was mined in block 842,241 at 9:34 PM UTC on May 5th. 
Exactly, this milestone was reached after 15 years, four months, and four days that the pseudonymous creator of Bitcoin (BTC), Satoshi Nakamoto, mined the first block of the network on January 3, 2009.
Obviously, the count of one billion transactions for Bitcoin does not include those processed on the Lightning Network, the layer 2 of Bitcoin for micropayments, but only those on the Blockchain. 
Instead, over its 5,603 days of existence, Bitcoin has processed an average of 178,475 daily transactions.
Bitcoin: the new milestone of one billion transactions reached after 15 years of history
Only in the last year, among the main factors that have allowed the Bitcoin network to reach and exceed 1 billion transactions, there are innovative protocols like Bitcoin Ordinals and Runes. 
For example, with just the Runes protocol, launched in conjunction with the fourth Bitcoin halving on April 20th at block 840,000, the network recorded an increase in BTC transactions of +57%, just on that day.
Rune is a new standard for Bitcoin tokens that allows you to embed data directly into Bitcoin transactions, going beyond simple financial transactions and allowing for the inclusion of additional information.
However, Bitcoin is not the first blockchain to surpass one billion transactions. Ethereum, launched in 2015, has already surpassed 2 billion transactions. 
The price of BTC
Meanwhile, the price of BTC seems to be recovering, registering a pump of +2.80% in the last seven days. 
Actually, at the time of writing, BTC is trading at a price of $64,172, still far away from its all-time high of over $73,000 reached in mid-March. But it is certainly recovering, compared to the $57,000 touched during these first days of May. 
And speaking of his price predictions, recently, veteran trader Peter Brandt talked about a drop to as low as $30,000 or to the lows of 2021, for the “exponential decay” phase of the Bitcoin cycle.
On the contrary, the experts from the Finder survey, have predicted that the price of BTC will rise to $109,141 by the end of 2024, $150,996 by 2025, and $567,489 by 2030.

Mercado Libre is moving forward with a $29 million investment in Bitcoin

Mercado Libre, one of the largest e-commerce operators in Latin America, reported revenue of 29 million dollars in Bitcoin (BTC) in a recent communication to the SEC.
This indicates a further push towards the institutional integration of Bitcoin in asset management. Additionally, other important financial institutions, such as BNY Mellon and BNP Paribas, have announced significant investments in Bitcoin-based ETF funds.
Let’s see below all the details. 

The e-commerce giant Mercado Libre and investments in Bitcoin
As anticipated, the recent statement to the SEC by Mercado Libre reveals an investment of 29 million dollars in Bitcoin as of March 31st. Highlighting the increasing institutional integration of cryptocurrencies in asset management.
Furthermore, this information, which confirms the adoption of the cryptocurrency announced by the company in 2021, demonstrates MercadoLibre’s commitment to digital assets, despite market fluctuations.
The latest filings with the SEC highlight the trend of financial institutions including Bitcoin in their wealth management strategies. Major players in the industry such as BNP Paribas and BNY Mellon have disclosed significant holdings in Bitcoin ETFs.
By reporting in this way a growing acceptance of cryptocurrencies in the traditional investment landscape. 
Even smaller companies, such as Quattro Advisors and Legacy Wealth Management, have reported significant holdings in Bitcoin ETFs, indicating that interest in these instruments is growing.
As the mid-May deadline for submitting 13F applications approaches, it is expected to have a clearer view of institutional strategies regarding investments in cryptocurrencies.Remember that 13F applications are requests for institutions managing at least 100 million dollars. 
The recent filing by MercadoLibre, along with the interest of other major players in Bitcoin ETFs, suggests that this trend towards integration of Bitcoin into wealth management is set to grow.
The recovery of Bitcoin and the impact of the labor market on cryptographic assets
Recent data shows that the cryptocurrency market is experiencing significant changes, with Bitcoin gaining ground while altcoins record modest gains. 
These trends emerge in a context of US economic relations that reveal challenges in the labor market. 
The market analyst Van de Poppe suggests that the recent drop in Bitcoin may have reached its lowest point, influenced by economic indicators.
The US economic data for April shows that unemployment has increased to 3.9%, while the growth of average hourly wages has been lower than expected. 
These developments, together with a slight deceleration of inflation, could favor interest in assets such as cryptocurrencies. 
Van de Poppe believes that the Federal Reserve could respond with measures such as quantitative easing or interest rate cuts, which could further support the growth of Bitcoin and altcoins.
Bitcoin is back above 61,600 dollars, showing resilience and potential for further gains. This positive signal could give momentum to altcoins, with a possible rally after the recent consolidation. 
Some analysts predict that, if the Federal Reserve were to adopt easing measures, cryptocurrencies could benefit from increased interest from investors seeking higher returns.
In other words, with the cryptocurrency market recovering from recent declines, it is expected that Bitcoin and altcoins could reach new highs in the coming months.

Dogecoin's 15% rise in 7 days means THIS for your DOGE holdings - AMBCrypto



Dogecoin’s price increased by more than 15% in the last seven days. 
Most metrics and market indicators looked bullish on DOGE.

Dogecoin [DOGE] investors were rejoicing as the meme coin had a comfortable weekly rally. 
The good news was that the latest price uptick allowed the meme coin to go above a key resistance level, which can result in a macro-bull rally soon. 
Dogecoin breaks a barrier
Dogecoin’s price dipped to $0.12 on the 1st of May, but soon after that, it gained bullish momentum. The uptrend allowed the meme coin to push its price up by 15% in the last seven days. 
According to CoinMarketCap at the time of writing, $0.1635 has a market capitalization of over $23 billion. 
A possible reason behind this surge could have been Elon Musk.
 AMBCrypto reported earlier how Tesla updated the FAQ section on its website, stating that DOGE may now be used to purchase even more Tesla products. 
It was interesting to note that despite the daily price uptick, sentiment around DOGE remained bearish, as evident from the dip in its Weighted Sentiment. 
Its Social Volume also declined after spiking on the 4th of May.
Source: Santiment
Rekt Capital, a popular crypto analyst, recently posted a tweet that gave hopes for a further rise in the meme coin’s price.
 As per the tweet, Dogecoin has just flipped a multi-year resistance into new support, putting an end to its macro downtrend. 
The tweet also mentioned that this development has now confirmed a macro uptrend for DOGE, which might allow it to reach new highs in the coming months. 
Dogecoin’s possible weekly targets
Though the macro-uptrend has begun, it would be ambitious to hope DOGE touches an all-time high anytime soon. Therefore, AMBCrypto analyzed DOGE’s metrics to find which way it was headed this week. 
Our analysis of Santiment’s data revealed that the meme coin’s MVRV ratio turned positive. This meant that more investors were in profit. 
Its velocity also shot up, indicating that DOGE was used more often in transactions within a set time frame.
Source: Santiment
A few of the technical indicators also looked pretty bullish. For instance, the MACD displayed a clear bullish crossover. 
The Relative Strength Index (RSI) also registered an uptick, indicating that the chances of a continued price surge were high. However, the Money Flow Index (MFI) was bearish as it remained under the neutral mark.

Realistic or not, here’s DOGE’s market cap in BTC’s terms  

To see the possible targets DOGE might reach if the bull rally continues. Our analysis of Hyblock Capital’s data revealed that it will be crucial for DOGE to cross $0.1669, as liquidation would rise sharply at that level.
 A successful breakout above that mark would open the door for DOGE to touch $0.18 or $0.19.

LayerZero Tells Sybil Farmers To Out Themselves Or Face Airdrop Exclusion - The Defiant

Sybil farmers that self-report will still receive 15% of their intended airdrop allocation.The development team behind LayerZero Labs, the popular cross-chain interoperability protocol, has vowed to weed out sybil farmers ahead of its upcoming airdrop.On May 3, LayerZero Labs announced it will conduct an internal investigation intended to identify sybil farmers and exclude them from receiving allocations as part of its future token generation event. The project said it will then follow up with a reward program offering 10% of sybil farmers’ intended token allocation as a reward for bounty hunters who identify additional sybil users.“Almost 6 million unique wallet addresses have interacted with LayerZero since its initial launch over two years ago,” LayerZero Labs said. “We believe it is in the protocol’s best interest to distribute tokens to durable users — not sybil farmers,” the team added via tweet.Sybil farming refers to the practice of creating multiple wallets controlled by a single user to generate large volumes of activity on a network or protocol in a bid to maximize their airdrop allocation.In 2022, Optimism disqualified more than 17,000 wallets suspected of engaging in sybil activity from its airdrop — equating to 6.83% of wallets eligible for the token drop. In September, 21,877 wallets were accused of comprising a sybil network farming activity on ZkSync Era, with the wallets found to be transacting a closed-source token amongst each other using a private decentralized exchange.LayerZero Labs flagged a variety of on-chain activity as grounds for exclusion from its drop, including a single entity participating in “industrial farming” via multiple wallets, users that minted “‘valueless’ NFT[s]” for the sole purpose of moving it between networks, users that repeatedly bridged a minuscule value of assets between chains, and users interacting with well-known sybil farming applications.“If you think you are a sybil, you are most likely a sybil,” LayerZero Labs said.However, LayerZero Labs said sybil farmers can self-report through signed on-chain messaging until May 18 and still receive 15% of their intended airdrop allocation. The project will also provide an API allowing industrial farmers to self-report.LayerZero Labs also noted that airdrop eligibility will be subject to “legal or geographic requirements,” suggesting that sybil farmers operating from countries posing regulatory risks such as the United States or North Korea may have little to gain from self-reporting.LayerZero announced it had taken the first snapshot for its long-awaited airdrop last week. In December, the project said it would distribute a token to early adopters in the first half of 2024, suggesting the event will take place within the next eight weeks.

South Korea Says No to Crypto Donations | Coinspeaker



The updated law welcomes donations in local government-issued, KRW-pegged stablecoins and blockchain-based gift vouchers.

South Korea has taken a firm stance on the use of cryptocurrencies for charitable donations within the country.  According to a local news media outlet, Kyunghyang Shinmun, the government has scrapped the use of digital assets for philanthropic causes in a proposed amendment of the “Donations Act”.
The Ministry of the Interior and Safety said it reviewed and amended the “Donations Act” to broaden the scope of acceptable donations but this does not include digital assets like Bitcoin (BTC).




South Korea Says No Crypto Donations
The original Donations Act was introduced in 2006 before the widespread use of smartphones and the availability of various payment methods. However, the tables have turned with recent inventions, including the launch of cryptocurrencies in 2009, as the rules do not cover the many payment options available in the market.
As a result, the Ministry revisited the Donations Act, proposing new measures in January 2024 that do not allow digital assets despite the burgeoning crypto market in South Korea. However, the updated law welcomes donations in local government-issued, KRW-pegged stablecoins and blockchain-based gift vouchers. It also supports traditional bank transfers and online payments.
According to the report, the regulations also come with automated response systems, postal services, and logistics services. If approved by the State Council after a legislative notice by June 10, the proposed law will become effective in July.
“We plan to proceed with procedures to ensure that the enforcement ordinance is passed before the end of July, and it will be implemented immediately after passage,” said a spokesperson from the country’s Ministry of Public Administration and Security.
South Korea to Accept Gift Cards for Donations
Starting in July, individuals looking to donate to charitable causes will have various alternative methods, including department store gift vouchers, stocks, and loyalty points from Korean internet giant Naver.
The amended law also outlines the specific purposes for collecting donations, including supporting children, adolescents, and people with disabilities, promoting employment, addressing low birth rates, aging populations, and rural decline, revitalizing local communities, and other public interest purposes.
Additionally, the legislation designated the second Monday of December every year as “Donation Day”, allowing national and local governments to organize commemorative events and provide rewards for donors.
Meanwhile, the exclusion of cryptocurrencies from accepted payments for charity donations in South Korea comes at a time when digital asset donations are gaining momentum globally. According to TheGivingBlock, more than $2 billion has been donated using virtual assets as of January 2024.

                        Jack Dorsey, the co-founder of Twitter, has stepped down from Bluesky’s board, the decentralized social media platform he originally envisioned and funded back in 2019 during his tenure as CEO of Twitter.In a Sunday post on the platform, Bluesky confirmed Dorsey’s departure from its board.“We sincerely thank Jack for his help funding and initiating the bluesky project. Today, Bluesky is thriving as an open source social network running on atproto, the decentralized protocol we have built,” the post read. Dorsey Provides No Reasons for Departure
Notably, neither Bluesky nor Dorsey provided reasons for his departure.Prior to the official announcement, Dorsey responded with a brief “no” to a query on X about his current status on Bluesky’s board. Meanwhile, Dorsey’s recent activity on X, where he promoted grants for open interest protocols and referred to the social network now owned by Elon Musk as “freedom technology,” garnered attention. Observers noted that Dorsey had significantly trimmed down his follow list on the platform, retaining only three individuals: Musk, Stella Assange (wife of WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange), and NSA whistleblower Edward Snowden.Dorsey’s decision to maintain Musk on his follow list, coupled with his endorsement of X, suggests a possible reconciliation between the two tech figures. This comes after Dorsey publicly criticized Musk’s management of X last year, expressing disapproval of the board’s decision to sell the platform to him.Bluesky, initially announced by Dorsey in late 2019, aimed to develop an open and decentralized standard for social media. However, it wasn’t until March 2023 that Bluesky entered beta testing, finally becoming available to the public on February 7, 2024. Despite its relatively recent launch, Bluesky boasts around 5.6 million users, according to its own statistics.Dorsey’s Block Expands Bitcoin Mining Ambitions
Dorsey’s departure from Bluesky’s board comes as his payments company Block has shifted its focus from designing chips to developing a full Bitcoin mining system.As reported, Block has unveiled its accomplishment of designing a standalone three-nanometer (3nm) Bitcoin mining chip and disclosed that it is currently collaborating with a leading global semiconductor foundry to finalize the chip’s design. However, the company’s mining project doesn’t stop at chip development. It plans to expand its efforts to include system design as well.It is worth noting that Dorsey has also been deeply involved in the cryptocurrency space. In addition to his role at Twitter, Dorsey served as the CEO of Square Inc., a financial services company that developed the popular mobile payment app, Cash App. Under his leadership, Square became one of the earliest mainstream companies to embrace Bitcoin, enabling users to buy, sell, and hold the cryptocurrency directly within the Cash App.Dorsey’s personal interest in Bitcoin is well-known, and he has been an outspoken advocate for its adoption and potential to revolutionize the financial industry. He has often highlighted Bitcoin’s role as a decentralized and inclusive form of currency, advocating for its use as a hedge against inflation and government overreach.

A Deep Dive Into ERC-6551 : The Future of NFTs

These one-of-a-kind digital items, securely stored on a blockchain have captured attention due to their ability to represent anything from artwork to real estate in the form of verifiable tokens. However, NFTs offer more than proof of ownership and transferability. With the introduction of token standards like ERC 6551, the capabilities and future potential of NFTs are expanding.
ERC-6551 is a token standard designed specifically for non-fungible tokens (NFTs). This standard enables each NFT to possess its unique on-chain identity within the blockchain ecosystem and facilitates interactions, with smart contracts. Under this standard, every ERC 721 token (another type of NFT) is associated with its own smart contract known as a “token-bound account.” To put it simply ERC 6551 empowers individual NFTs to function as self-contained “Web3 wallets.”

In the world of blockchain, non-fungible tokens (NFTs) have emerged as a concept that is transforming our perception of digital asset ownership. 

How Does ERC-6551 Differ From ERC-721?
ERC 6551 differs from ERC 721 in that it enables the creation of contract accounts for each ERC 721 token, which leads to token-bound accounts (TBAs). TBAs allow NFTs to possess assets engage with contracts and have their distinct, on-chain identity. Furthermore, ERC 6551 utilizes a permissionless registry that’s compatible with blockchain platforms enabling NFTs to interact with different blockchain ecosystems. 
Moreover, TBAs have the ability to incorporate rules that dictate the requirements, for receiving Ether while also following established Ethereum protocols. These protocols ensure a TBA interface. Grant execution permissions exclusively, to owner accounts. On the other hand, ERC 721 NFTs can only be transferred without any capacity to own assets interact with smart contracts adapt according to external factors, or respond to user inputs.

Master the art of NFT valuation and ensure accurate assessments for your digital assets. Gain essential insights and strategies with this comprehensive article.


Advantages Of ERC-6551 In NFTs
Functionality like Smart Contract Wallets

Just like smart contract wallets, ERC 6551 tokens can hold similar functions. These functions can include holding tokens and other NFTs.
Better Interactivity for NFTs

With ERC 6551, NFTs have the ability to own assets and interact with applications. This elevates their interactivity and dynamism. The adoption and usage of NFTs are expected to increase due to these capabilities.
Introduction of TBAs

The token-bound accounts that are linked to particular NFTs under ERC 6551, combine tokens, assets, and NFTs into a single account. This integration allows users to easily switch between platforms and transfer assets. This in turn results in a better user interface.

Learn essential strategies for safeguarding your NFT investments in the volatile landscape of Web3 digital assets, empowering you to navigate confidently, with this comprehensive article.

Cross Chain Compatibility

The ERC-6551 standard is designed to be compatible with other blockchains,  thus facilitating interaction with various decentralized applications (dApps) and smart contracts.
New Use Cases for NFTs

The introduction of ERC 6551 opens up possibilities for using NFTs in different ways such as representing digital assets within the metaverse or incorporating in-game items within gaming applications.
Better Security Through Token Restrictions

Token-bound accounts allow tokens to be locked exclusively to accounts, enhancing security measures. The tokens are designed to be used under parameters set by the issuer. This helps in ensuring that the tokens are used as intended.
Real-World Use Cases And Examples Of ERC-6551 In Action
Let Us Explore Some Real-Life Scenarios Where the ERC-6551 Standard Can be Put Into Action

Gaming- The ERC 6551 enhances gaming experiences by allowing players to use NFTs for in-game events, player actions, or real-world factors.
Asset management- Managing assets can be challenging when dealing with distinct NFTs. However, by combing all assets, including those, from games into a token-bound account it becomes easier to oversee them. For example, one can categorize NFTs based on the game they belong to or group deck NFTs based on the characteristics of each card.
Linking with benefits- Instead of simply selling NFTs on their own it is possible to add various benefits to them. Not only can NFTs be linked with other NFTs but native tokens like ERC 20 and ETH can also be incorporated. As an illustration, an NFT membership card could be created that offers content or provides exclusive deals for the first purchasers using ETH.


Following are Some Examples of NFT Projects That Have Used ERC-6551
Sapienz
The Sapienz project demonstrates the improved non-fungibility of NFTs. Multiple NFTs can be added to a main NFT’s token-bound account and it can be converted into different wearables and backgrounds.

The Managers
The Managers NFT project employs the ERC-6551 standard to enable NFTs to own other NFTs, participate in DeFi applications, and interact with smart contracts.

Explore the future of NFTs, from emerging trends to insightful predictions, and stay ahead of the curve with this comprehensive article.


CloneX and Doodles
CloneX and Doodles are projects that focus on PFP collectibles and can take advantage of the increased utility of their NFTs by rewarding holders with token-bound accounts. They can airdrop incentives and rewards directly to holders in their collection, incentivizing engagement and loyalty even further.



Since ERC 6551 is a standard it faces some challenges:
Limited Support & Integration Complexity
Not all wallets and exchanges currently support ERC 6551. This means that users looking to utilize ERC 6551 tokens may need to rely on wallets or exchanges that have implemented this standard. This can pose difficulties, for existing crypto and web3 projects in their transition to this token standard.
Security Concerns
Due to its novelty and limited testing there are risks, errors, and security vulnerabilities associated with this standard.

Despite these challenges, ERC 6551 holds the potential to revolutionize the NFT industry by introducing interactive features for NFTs. Additionally, it empowers ERC 721 NFTs with the capabilities of an Ethereum account, through token-bound accounts. As the crypto community continues to explore and innovate with this token standard we can anticipate enhancements and exciting use cases emerging in the future.
The Future Prospects And Adoption Of ERC-6551 In The NFT Ecosystem
As NFTs evolve and new use cases emerge, ERC-6551 offers exciting opportunities for creators, collectors, and investors. However, it is important to acknowledge that there may be challenges to overcome including the technical complexity and compatibility with existing technology. Like any technology, ERC 6551 will require time to gain adoption and for developers, creators, and users to fully engage with this new standard. Nevertheless, its potential to transform the NFT landscape is undeniable.

An interesting possibility is: that NFTs can become more interactive by allowing changes and evolutions over time. By utilizing smart contracts NFTs could possess properties that are adaptable based on specific conditions or triggers. Additionally, we may see an integration between NFTs and augmented reality technologies resulting in a more immersive experience for users. Furthermore, various industries such as estate, finance, and even voting systems could find applications, for NFTs.
In general, ERC 6551 represents a progression, in the realm of NFTs. It enables NFTs to operate as their contract accounts thereby introducing a wide array of fresh possibilities and functionalities.
Conclusion
In conclusion, ERC 6551 serves as an upgrade for NFTs that enhances their dynamism, interactivity, and versatility. This novel standard empowers NFTs to possess assets collaborate with contracts and engage with blockchain platforms. Although it is still early in its development ERC 6551 brings forth prospects for NFTs. As more individuals gain an understanding of the potential of NFTs they are becoming increasingly popular and valuable across industries and aspects of our lives. This is indeed an exciting time, for the world of NFTs!

Important Shiba Inu Metric Explodes by 4,000%: What About the SHIB Price?


																TL;DR

Shiba Inu’s burn rate skyrockets, removing millions of tokens on a daily scale, part of a larger effort to reduce supply and enhance value.
Shibarium development advances with upgrades aimed at improving speed, scalability, and transaction fees, potentially contributing to SHIB’s recent price increase.


SHIB Burn Rate Going Through the Roof
The popular meme coin – Shiba Inu – witnessed another substantial burn rate increase. Data shows that it skyrocketed by over 4,000% in the past 24 hours, resulting in over 81 million tokens removed from circulation. 
The program has been quite successful as of late, with almost 1.7 billion SHIB assets destroyed throughout April. Its ultimate goal is to reduce the tremendous supply of the meme coin, making it scarcer and possibly more valuable in the future.
SHIB’s price has climbed 6% weekly and over 150% since May last year. The asset remains the second-largest in the meme coin cohort, with a market capitalization nearing $15 billion.





SHIB Price, Source: CoinGecko
Shibarium’s Potential Role
Another element that could have positively contributed to the latest revival of Shiba Inu’s price is the development of the layer-2 scaling solution – Shibarium. The network, which aims to elevate the token above its rivals in the meme coin realm by improving speed, enhancing scalability, and lowering transaction fees, recently underwent two essential upgrades.
The first one occurred in mid-April when the team launched a new user interface (UI) update, describing it as “faster, smoother, and more accessible than ever.” The goal was to enhance compatibility with popular self-custody wallets, including MetaMask, Coinbase Wallet, and Trust Wallet. 
Shortly after, the developers introduced another advancement through a “hard fork.” It aims to improve user experience, empower the community of developers and innovators, and implement quicker block processing times.
“We are also smoothing out transaction fee variations during high traffic times, making costs more predictable and fair for everyone. This ensures our platform remains affordable and accessible,” the team added.

FTX and Binance Founders’ Fall Signifies Crypto’s Illicit Sides


							

FTX Founder Sam Bankman-Fried and Binance Founder Changpeng Zhao faced prison sentences of 25 years and 4 months, respectively.



The crypto titans who once ruled the crypto world fell following stringent regulatory scrutiny.



Lawyer Braden Perry highlights that these cases show the dark and illicit corners of crypto.




FTX’s Sam Bankman Fried and Binance’s Changpeng Zhao, once the rulers of the crypto world, recently faced legal challenges and prison sentences, showcasing the space’s unpredictable nature. With the court ruling 25 years of imprisonment for Bankman Fried and a 4-month sentence for Zhao, the prolonged battle between the crypto titans reportedly ended in an anticlimactic finish.



Braden Perry, a former senior trial lawyer of CFTC, commented that the cases surrounding Bankman-Fried and Zhao highlight the “dark and illicit corners of crypto.” He added,




 “Comparing CZ and SBF, both figures emerged as prominent in the cryptocurrency sector but under vastly different circumstances…The nature of their alleged crimes reflects different aspects of the ‘dark’ and illicit corners of crypto: CZ’s case seems to focus on regulatory and compliance failures, while SBF’s case hinges on direct financial misconduct and deception.” 




For years, both Bankman-Fried and Zhao were at the top of the blockchain industry. They were very popular among crypto aspirants as they simplified the complexities of the crypto ecosystem.



FTX, which stood at the pinnacle of success, collapsed in 2022, leading to a protracted crypto winter. Similarly, Binance, one of the largest crypto exchanges, faced regulatory headwinds in 2023 when the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) filed a lawsuit against the firm for allegedly offering unregistered securities.









Though the FTX founder pleaded not guilty to the charges, he was later convicted of seven criminal counts, including using customer funds. In three weeks, Binance founder was also convicted of violating securities laws, after which he pleaded guilty and stepped down as the exchange’s CEO. Subsequently, both Bankman-Fried and Zhao were sent to prison under different circumstances.

Satoshi-era dormant Bitcoin address wakes up after 10 years

A dormant Bitcoin address dating back to the era when Satoshi Nakamoto was still active has woken up after 10 years. The Bitcoin wallet containing 687 BTC ($43.9 million) transferred its holdings to two different wallets on May 6.The wallet first transferred 625.43 Bitcoin (BTC) to an address starting with bc1qky and the remaining 61.9 BTC to bc1qdc. The movement of funds from very old wallets, especially from the Satoshi era, often sparks curiosity among the crypto community.The term “Satoshi era” relates to the early days after Bitcoin was created when its pseudonymous founder, Nakamoto, was active online in forums. Some Satoshi-era wallets are often speculated to be linked to Satoshi himself.One such wallet woke from dormancy in August 2023 after almost 14 years and transferred 1,005 BTC mined in 2010. The wallet movement created the most buzz on social media, with speculation that it was Satoshi’s wallet. However, experts suggest it is more likely associated with early miners or buyers just trying to make a profit.According to a Fortune report, a total of 1.75 million Bitcoin wallets have remained inactive for over a decade. Many of these wallets contain significant BTC holdings estimated to be bought when the BTC price was trading in double digits and is currently valued in millions. These dormant wallets contain 1,798,681 Bitcoin worth around $121 billion at today’s price.Source: ChainalysisRelated: 100%+ BTC price gains? Bitcoin faces ‘massively overvalued’ stocksOver the past couple of years, numerous Satoshi-era wallets have been activated only to transfer the BTC holdings to a new address. Some of these wallets were also found to have transferred their BTC holdings to crypto exchanges, which suggests they might be looking to take profits after nearly a decade.Source: ChainalysisIn July 2023, a wallet dormant for 11 years transferred $30 million in BTC. In November 2023, three Satoshi-era BTC wallets transferred $230 million in BTC after six years of dormancy. The three wallets are believed to be connected to the same individual or organization, as they made their last transactions on Nov. 5, 2017.Magazine: The value of a legacy: Hunting down Satoshi’s Bitcoin

Ripple v. SEC case update as of May 6, 2024


With the legal dispute between the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and Ripple far from over, the blockchain company has filed further support of its motion to strike new expert materials and in reply to the securities watchdog’s opposition to this motion.
Indeed, after the SEC filed its opposition to Ripple’s request to strike the declaration by the regulator’s witness, Andrea Fox, arguing that it did not constitute undisclosed expert testimony, Ripple’s legal team filed a letter in support of its motion, as per the document shared by defense attorney James K. Filan on May 2.

Specifically, the document argues that, in the opposition, on which Finbold reported earlier, the “SEC has failed to show that the Declaration of Andrea Fox (…) is summary evidence rather than expert testimony, or that it was timely under the Court’s scheduling order.”


Ripple’s counter-arguments
As Ripple’s lawyers explained, “Fox is an expert because she purports to use ‘technical or other specialized knowledge’ to ‘help the trier of fact to understand the evidence or to determine a fact in issue.’ She does not merely apply basic arithmetic to Ripple’s financial records,’ as the SEC contends.”

“Rather, she analyzes Ripple’s records, third-party evidence, and expert reports; draws inferences and conclusions about those documents; and calculates disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and discount amounts based on her analysis.”

Upon listing several examples to substantiate that Fox’s declaration is, in fact, an expert testimony, including her qualifications as an accountant as part of her testimony “merely to show that she could do basic arithmetic,” Ripple’s legal team also accused the regulator of using wordplay to argue its side.

“The agency asserts that because it reserved its right to ‘submit the declaration of a summary witness,’ as opposed to ‘serv[ing] a rebuttal expert report,’ it could wait until its remedies motion to do so. If the SEC really meant ‘submit’ to lay the groundwork for a summary witness disclosure after the close of discovery, its proposal was misleading.”

Meanwhile, the deadline for the SEC to file its response is coming up, as Magistrate Judge Sarah Netburn has set it for May 6, 2024. In the view of legal expert Bill Morgan, “Ripple will lose the motion but the judge will accept Fox gave some expert evidence and permit Ripple to depose her.”

At press time, XRP, the token at the center of the Ripple v. SEC courtroom standoff, was trading at $0.54, up 2.57% on the day, gaining 7.78% over the week, as it moves to reverse the loss of 8.89% accumulated in the last month, according to the latest charts retrieved by Finbold on May 6.

Bitcoin mining revenue hits post-halving yearly low

Earnings from Bitcoin mining dropped significantly in May as the effects of the fourth Bitcoin halving event set in. The Bitcoin halving mechanism was designed to increasingly limit the issuance of 21 million Bitcoin (BTC) spread over decades. The April 20 halving reduced mining rewards to 3.125 BTC from 6.25 BTC. While initial hype around the halving and the launch of Bitcoin Runes temporarily sustained the miners’ daily earnings, a strong revenue drop was recorded in May. On May 1, the total revenue earned from block rewards and transaction fees fell to a new low of $26.3 million. In contrast, Bitcoin miners earned roughly $6 million per day on average before the halving, according to data sourced from Blockchain.com.Total value in United States dollars of Coinbase block rewards and transaction fees paid to miners. Source: blockchain.comAll the other days in May also recorded similar revenue patterns, signaling a new normal in Bitcoin mining revenue. Coincidentally, mining revenue peaked on April 20, marking an all-time high daily earnings of over $107 million for the first time in Bitcoin history. Anticipating this significant drop, miners worldwide restrategized operations to remain profitable in the next phase of the Bitcoin economy. If not, miners would have to rely solely on Bitcoin’s high market value to support operations. Read Cointelegraph’s guide to learn more about being a profitable Bitcoin miner from home.CryptoQuant CEO Ki Young Ju calculated that Bitcoin needs to hold above $80,000 to keep mining profitable post-halving under current conditions. However, most miners took proactive measures to upgrade their mining equipment to reduce long-term operational costs while being competitive. Related: Bitcoin reaches one billion transactionsFor example, Bitcoin mining firm Bitfarms allotted $240 million to triple its hash rate. Previously speaking to Cointelegraph, Bitfarms chief financial officer Jeffrey Lucas laid out the firm’s drive to procure 88,000 highly efficient Bitcoin miners:“The transformational fleet upgrade propels Bitfarms in scale and profitability amid the Bitcoin halving. This is a game changer that triples our hash rate to 21 EH/s, increases our targeted operating capacity by 83% to 440 megawatts (MW), and improves fleet efficiency by 40% to 21 w/TH.”Despite the effort, Bitfarms recorded its lowest monthly earnings of 269 Bitcoin in over two years in April.Magazine: CZ gets jail sentence, Gensler viewed Ether as security, and FBI targets mixers: Hodler’s Digest, April 28 – May 4

Here's When Bitcoin Could Peak In This Accelerated Bull Run


                            The current Bitcoin price behavior and its deviations from expected cyclical patterns remain a central theme of analysis. Crypto analyst Rekt Capital (@rektcapital) recently shared new insights on X concerning Bitcoin’s potential peak during the ongoing bull run, which is progressing at an atypical pace compared to historical data.
When Will Bitcoin Peak This Cycle?
In a detailed post, Rekt Capital pointed out that as of mid-March 2024, Bitcoin had not only reached new all-time highs but had done so approximately 260 days ahead of its traditional halving-induced cycles. This marked a significant acceleration. “When Bitcoin rallied to new All Time Highs in mid-March 2024, Bitcoin was accelerating in its cycle by 260 days compared to traditional Halving Cycles,” stated Rekt Capital.
However, this rapid pace has not been sustained. Over the past two months, Bitcoin has been in a phase of consolidation, which has altered its trajectory. The acceleration advantage has decreased to about 210 days compared to previous cycles. This deceleration is a critical factor, as it could lead to a re-synchronization with the typical halving cycle. Typically, BTC peaks 518-546 days after a halving event.

The analyst suggests shifting the predictive focus from just halving events to the periods after Bitcoin surpasses its previous all-time highs. Historically, BTC price tends to reach a bull market top within 266 to 315 days after breaking these thresholds. Given that this milestone was achieved again in mid-March 2024, the projected window for the next bull market peak could be set between late November 2024 and late January 2025.
Nevertheless, a notable trend is the increasing duration for which Bitcoin maintains levels beyond its old highs. In 2013, this period lasted 268 days, in 2017 it extended to 280 days, and by 2021, it had increased to 315 days.
This pattern suggests an incremental extension of approximately 14 to 35 days per cycle. “Historically, the amount of days that Bitcoin has spent beyond old All Time Highs has increased by approximately 14 days to 35 days,” explained Rekt Capital.

Adding these increments to the initial range of 266 to 315 days post-old highs, the peak could potentially extend to between 280 and 350 days post-breakout. This adjustment shifts the expected peak time frame to between mid-December 2024 and early March 2025.

Potential Synchronization With Halving Cycles
Despite the current accelerated cycle, there remains a possibility that further deceleration could align Bitcoin more closely with its halving cycle. In past cycles, such as those between 2015-2017 and 2019-2021, Bitcoin peaked at 518 and 546 days post-halving, respectively. If Bitcoin’s rate of acceleration continues to decrease, the cycle may eventually resynchronize, potentially delaying the peak to between mid-September and mid-October 2025.
Rekt Capital elaborates, “But if Bitcoin continues to reduce its current acceleration in the cycle, it would resynchronize with traditional Halving cycles.” This could result in a peak more aligned with historical patterns, diverging from the current accelerated timeline.
At press time, BTC traded at $64,262.

Back to extreme greed past $65K? 5 things to know in Bitcoin this week

Bitcoin (BTC) starts a new week with bullish sentiment back on the radar as $64,000 returns.In a stirring comeback, BTC price action has managed to leave its latest swing lows far behind it, gaining nearly $8,000 versus the pit of last week’s sell-off.Despite some of those gains coming during the weekend, they proved to have staying power, and during the May 6 Asia trading session, bears are having no luck pushing the market back down.The mood is thus considerably different into the second week of May — but increasing greed is already visible.Can Bitcoin and altcoins manage sustainable momentum toward all-time highs?This is the question that traders and analysts will be posing after a trip to two-month lows and a considerable flushing out of leverage.On exchanges, things remain promising — funding rates are neutral, and there are few signs of mass desire to long BTC at current levels.Should things take a turn for the worse, however, it is key support levels which will come in for a fresh test. These include the short-term holder (STH) cost basis and 100-day moving average — both classic bounce levels.Cointelegraph takes a closer look at the current state of Bitcoin as the average trader recovers from a hair-raising start to the month.Bitcoin bulls triumphant after weekly close The weekend ultimately posed no threat to Bitcoin bulls, providing some unexpected upside that ended up holding into the weekly close.BTC/USD 1-hour chart. Source: TradingViewThis came in at around $64,000 on Bitstamp, data from Cointelegraph Markets Pro and TradingView confirms — around $900 higher versus the end of April.While not a giant weekly candle, the performance represents an impressive return to form for BTC/USD, which saw a trip to $56,500 in the intervening period.Unsurprisingly, market observers are quietly optimistic.“Swept all the liquidity below that was built up over the past 2 months and bounced quickly afterwards,” popular trader Daan Crypto Trades summarized in part of his latest commentary on X (formerly Twitter). “We're still in the bigger range but at least got some upside momentum going into next week.”BTC/USD chart.

Altcoins slowly waking up.”BTC/USD chart. Source: Michaël van de Poppe/XAs Cointelegraph continues to report, $60,000 coincides with several trendlines, which have buoyed BTC/USD since the bull market began in early 2023.These include the 100-day simple moving average (SMA) and STH realized price — the aggregate cost basis of entities holding coins for 155 days or less.These two levels sit at $60,650 and $59,920 as of May 6, the latter figure provided by statistics resource Look Into Bitcoin.Bitcoin STH realized price chart.

U.S. Bitcoin ETFs: 'Good' for crypto or not? Analyst weighs in - AMBCrypto



U.S. Bitcoin ETFs elicited mixed signals on the crypto regulatory front. 
Apart from BTC, most of the crypto projects faced regulatory uncertainty. 

The U.S. spot Bitcoin [BTC] ETF approval in January continues to elicit mixed feelings about whether it “legitimizes crypto.” 
In a recent interview with Bitcoin Magazine, Neel Maitra, a former SEC crypto specialist, said that the January approval was “grudging” and doesn’t look great for the market. 
Part of his speech stated, 
“Its (approval) was grudging, and it was just for Bitcoin, and it’s not good news for the crypto generally.” 
To support his arguments, Maitra mentioned the SEC’s rejection of spot BTC ETFs in the past seven years before the courts forced its hand. 
Additionally, the agency emphasized that the approval was limited to BTC and shouldn’t be read as a general crypto approval. 
Divergent views on Bitcoin ETF impact
However, Franklin Bi, a general partner at Pantera Capital, had a contrarian take. In an interview with “The Block,” the exec claimed that the U.S. spot BTC ETFs approval “validated crypto.” 
He further commented, 
“The approval has really shown people that directionally speaking, regulation is still moving in a positive direction for digital assets.”
The executive added that the approval also convinced many institutional investors that crypto is a long-term technology trend worth exploring. 
True to Bi’s word, U.S. spot BTC ETFs have seen massive interest from institutional players. 
For instance, the leading world asset manager, BlackRock, had an impressive BTC ETF debut and is eyeing the tokenization of real-world assets on the blockchain. 
However, regulatory heat in the industry still exists. Despite the approvals, the SEC has filed lawsuits against Uniswap [UNI] and Consensys’ MetaMask. 
Additionally, the agency has not clearly stated whether Ethereum [ETH] is not a security. This prompted Consensys to sue the SEC and seek clarity from the courts on the status of ETH. 
In a separate development, a new class action lawsuit against Coinbase claims that the exchange misled investors into buying “securities” like Solana [SOL], Near [NEAR], and UNI, amongst others. 
That said, BTC had regulatory clarity after the January ETF approvals. However, several crypto projects and tokens like ETH face regulatory uncertainty.
 Will it take more than ETF approval to validate crypto legitimacy in the U.S.?

Ripple Vs. SEC Legal Saga: Expert Outlines Timeline For Settlement And Ruling | Bitcoinist.com


								Ashley Prosper, an XRP enthusiast deeply invested in the outcome of the legal clash between Ripple and the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), shared insights on the subject, outlining the possible timeline for a settlement and final ruling of the case.
Potential Settlement And Final Ruling Timeline In The Ripple Case
According to the expert, the SEC’s final response in the remedies phase in its case between Ripple is anticipated to be released tomorrow, on May 7. Following the response, US Judge Analisa Torres is expected to make her final decision on the matter, which Ashley Prosper believes will take place between July and August, or possibly September.

While the XRP enthusiast is confident that an appeal could be filed from both parties after this, she affirms it will not require as much time as people anticipate. Thus, she has urged the community to observe between now and any prospective decision from an appeal court, as a settlement could happen at any time within this timeframe.
The expert further drew attention to US attorney James K. Filan’s post highlighting several crucial dates in the legal dispute between Ripple and the regulatory watchdog. Filan pointed out two important dates in the case which are March 22, for which the SEC filed an opening brief, and May 6, for which the agency will file a reply brief.
 It is noteworthy that during the opening brief in March, the SEC argued that the payment had raised its XRP sales since filing the complaint. An astonishing amount of over $729 million in unregistered institutional sales is covered in the Summary Judgment Order, according to the Commission. However, it is insignificant compared to the over-redacted dollar number in XRP sales that Ripple has made since the litigation began, including billions after the Summary Judgement Order, the majority of which appear to be institutional purchases.
Also, the SEC made it clear that Ripple is in a good position to pay a sizable civil penalty. As a result, the Commission requested that the court should forbid the company from offering institutional investors unregistered XRP.
The SEC’s Reply Brief To Take Place Today
Today, May 6, the case is expected to reach a crucial point, as the SEC is scheduled to file a reply brief in response to Ripple’s protests about the significant fines that the commission has suggested. 

The agency is seeking an $876.3 million civil penalty, an additional $876.3 million in disgorgement, and $198.15 million in prejudgment interest, totaling a proposed fine of $1.95 billion. However, the payment company countered the request, claiming the SEC did not demonstrate the need for a disgorgement and that any civil penalty should be limited to a maximum of $10 million.
Though experts believe the SEC will probably stick to its disgorgement position, there are speculations that the court might rule in favor of the firm this time.

Sui Foundation Addresses Concerns Over Token Supply Distribution


							

Sui Foundation ensures transparency by disclosing token allocations, fostering trust in its emission plan.



Locked tokens are strategically utilized to support essential ecosystem functions for growth.



Reinvesting staking rewards promotes fairness despite concerns over distribution raised by some figures.




In response to recent community concerns regarding the token supply of Sui, Wu Blockchain, a crypto news reporter, reports the official statement from Sui addressing the doubts. According to the statement, Mysten Labs’ founder does not control crucial aspects such as the Sui Foundation treasury, stake subsidies, or investor tokens.







However, despite the clarification, there have been discussions on social media platforms regarding the token allocation, especially as Sui marks its one-year milestone. The debate revolves around the influence of Mysten Labs’ founders on various token allocations, including the Sui Foundation treasury and stake subsidies.



The foundation asserts that every token allocation is fully disclosed with a timeline, in alignment with the emission plan. This transparency is aimed at ensuring that all participants have full information regarding the token supply and distribution.



Moreover, the Sui Foundation, as the largest holder of locked tokens in the ecosystem, plays a pivotal role in its growth and development. The foundation utilizes these tokens to support essential guild members, enhance the programming language, bolster network security, and conduct research for the creation of new products. This strategic utilization aims to foster a thriving ecosystem.









Significantly, the staking rewards and transaction fees generated from network activities are reinvested back into the Sui ecosystem by the foundation. This practice promotes equality and fairness among ecosystem participants, ensuring that rewards are shared equitably.



However, concerns have been raised by Cyber Capital founder Justin Bons regarding the fairness of staked Sui supply distribution among the founders. Bons’ concerns, though, were dismissed by Sui, stating that the founding members do not exert control over the token supply. The foundation remains committed to transparency, striving to provide comprehensive information to all stakeholders.







Recent data indicates that over 8 billion SUI tokens have been staked, with the founding team accounting for more than 84% of the staked supply. Nonetheless, these figures reflect the intended distribution mechanism, and the foundation asserts that the founding team’s holdings do not imply disproportionate control over the ecosystem.

Understanding Bitcoin's Halving Cycle: Key Phases and Market Implications | Cryptoglobe


                                
According to the insights of crypto analyst Rekt Capital, Bitcoin’s much-anticipated halving event continues to be a pivotal catalyst in defining its market dynamics. 



Occurring just over two weeks ago, this event purportedly initiates a cyclical influence on Bitcoin’s price and investor behavior, unfolding in three distinct phases. 



Phase 1: Pre-Halving Retrace



The first phase, the pre-halving retrace, involves a notable price drop, which, in this cycle, was a 23.6% decrease. According to Rekt Capital, this is a moderate decrease compared to the 38% drop in 2016 and the 19% drop in 2020. These retracements are not merely downturns but are critical in setting the stage for what the analyst describes as the re-accumulation range. This phase typically precedes the halving and prepares the market for more stabilized activity post-event.



Phase 2: Re-Accumulation







            
            

            
            

            
            

        

Following the halving, the market transitions into what Rekt Capital refers to as the re-accumulation phase. This period is crucial as it establishes the foundation for subsequent price movements. During this phase, Bitcoin’s price consolidates within a defined range, characterized by pullbacks and sideways movements—a reflection of normal range-bound behavior as the market tempers the preceding rally.



Rekt Capital notes that the duration of this phase can span several weeks to months, often ending with a significant price breakout. This stage can challenge investor patience, as many may feel disillusioned by the lack of dramatic price movements or become disenchanted due to the prolonged period of inactivity.



Phase 3: Parabolic Uptrend



The final phase, as highlighted by the crypto analyst, is the parabolic uptrend. This phase marks a period of accelerated growth for Bitcoin, as it breaks out from the re-accumulation range and embarks on a rapid upward trajectory. Historically, according to Rekt Capital, this uptrend has lasted just over a year, around 385 days. However, they believe that current market observations suggest a potentially accelerated cycle that could halve this duration in the current market cycle.

Bitcoin network celebrates 1 billion transactions as a Satoshi-era wallet awakens

Bitcoin network processed its one billionth transaction 15 years after it mined its genesis block in January 2009.Notably, the network achieved this milestone the same day a Satoshi-era Bitcoin address came to life.1 billion transactionsAccording to data from the Bitcoin dashboard on Clark Moody, the network processed its one billionth transaction in block 842,241 at 05:34 UTC+8 on May 6.On average, the network has processed 178,475 transactions daily within the 15 years of its launch.The milestone drew praise from the crypto community, who have set eyes on the next billion target.Tarik Sammour, an associate professor at the University of Adelaide, pointed out that Bitcoin achieved this milestone “flawlessly, securely, and without any centralized intermediary.”Similarly, Matteo Pellegrini, the founder of the Orange Pill App, noted that Bitcoin reached this milestone in 15 years compared to Visa’s 25 years.What is driving Bitcoin transaction volume?In its early years, Bitcoin transactions were mainly driven by users using the coin to move value between themselves. However, that trend has changed recently, thanks to the launch of novel protocols like Ordinals Inscriptions and Runes. These assets have drawn increased attention and interest to the blockchain, spurring high network activities.For context, the Bitcoin blockchain recorded its highest daily transaction volume on April 23, processing over 926,000 transactions, of which approximately 90% stemmed from the Runes protocol.Moreover, the launch of spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) in January this year has also increased the number of transactions the network handles.Satoshi era BTC addressA long-dormant Bitcoin address, originating from the early days of Satoshi Nakamoto’s creation, was recently brought back to life after a decade of dormancy.Once holding 687 BTC valued at $43.9 million, the wallet saw its contents split and transferred to two distinct addresses during the early hours of today, May 6. In this transaction, 625.43 BTC found its way to an address beginning with bc1qky, while the remaining 61.9 BTC headed to bc1qdc.Blockchain investigator Lookonchain reported that the whale first received the 687.33 BTC on Jan. 12, 2014, when the price was $917.Mentioned in this articlePosted In: Bitcoin, Crypto

Shiba Inu (SHIB) is on a major rebound in its burn rate as more than 81 million tokens have been sent to dead wallets. Data from Shiba Inu burn tracker Shibburn pegs the burn rate at 4,085.94% in the past 24 hours.Build up in deflated SHIBEvery Shiba Inu sent to the burn address is designed to contribute to the overall SHIB taken out of circulation. The latest Shiba Inu burnt has pushed the total incinerated to 410,726,232,655,518 SHIB. With this, about 589,273,767,344,481 SHIB is left in circulation.Meeting SHIB investors’ expectations from this incinerated token remains a volatile subject. The 81,649,878 SHIB burnt is worth roughly $2,039, a valuation that is not enough to trigger a significant uptick in the price of the underlying token.Shiba Inu Burn Chart. Source: ShibburnHowever, the surge in the Shiba Inu burn rate helps in resetting the optimism of community members. It also underscores the community's confidence that when the SHIB burn portal is launched, it will yield the expected results. With the SHIB army burning the tokens willingly, there is expected to be more intense deflation when automatic burning sets in.Ultimate targetThe ultimate target for Shiba Inu with its burn campaign is to shrink the supply to a level where price discovery can be recorded. Shiba Inu proponents are nursing a long-term price of one cent, a price level that is economically impossible at the current supply rate.Pending when this is achieved, the core team behind Shiba Inu led by Shytoshi Kusama is introducing a new utility that can drive demand. The launch of the Shibarium hard fork is one example that can drive adoption with enhanced protocol versatility.At the time of writing, the price of SHIB jumped 0.55% in 24 hours to $0.00002498.

This is not the first time the meme coin has topped that ranking. It was the most-traded digital currency on WazirX’s platform in March, surpassing BTC, PEPE, FLOKI, and DOGE. Recall that SHIB was the second-most traded cryptocurrency on the trading venue for 2023.
It is worth mentioning that WazirX is among the leading Indian cryptocurrency exchanges, with over 6 million registered users and monthly trading volume equaling billions of dollars. It is part of the Binance group and serves clients in more than 180 countries.




Recent SHIB Price Predictions
The meme coin’s price has been flashing green for the past few days, with some analysts suggesting that a more substantial rally could be on the horizon. One example is the X user Ali Martinez, who admitted placing buy orders, hoping for a 300% surge.
Rekt Capital and crypto content creator Jake Gagain also outlined bullish predictions recently. The former envisioned a triple-digit price increase, whereas the latter argued that “fading” Shiba Inu “is a major mistake.” 
The resurgence of Shiba Inu‘s burn rate and the development of the layer-2 blockchain solution – Shibarium – are two major factors that could positively impact the asset’s value. As CryptoPotato reported, over 81 million tokens were destroyed in the last 24 hours, while the network underwent two essential upgrades.

Bitcoin’s One Billion Transaction Astonished Crypto Marke...


                                Bitcoin Announced on Completion of One Billion Transaction                                Bitcoin finally recorded its one Billion transactions on its Bitcoin Network setting an example for other Cryptocurrencies. It also highlights the history of 15 years with its one billion hits. What Estimates Bitcoin Shows?The statistics and dynamics shows that Bitcoin recorded 178,475 average transactions on a daily basis which completed one billion counts by existing 5603 days. The dashboard of Clark Moody shows 1 billion transactions on 5 may 2024 which was mined into 842,241 on the same day. Bitcoin is one of the oldest Cryptocurrency Network that recorded one billion transactions.  This number counts to one billion exactly after 15 years, 4 months, and 4 days where Bitcoin’s spurious initiator Satoshi Nakamoto on 3rd January 2009 mined the first and foremost Blockchain Network.One Billion Bitcoin transactions doesn’t include the transactions made on the lightning network that is the Bitcoin layer 2 network which mainly focuses on Micropayments. Lightning Network launched in January 2018 and after that millions of transactions take place on the lightning Network. In August 2023, the statistics showed approximately 6.6 million transactions on lower bounds on the lightning network. On 4th May 2024, the daily transactions of Bitcoin down to 660,260Ethereum Surpasses BitcoinAlthough Bitcoin is the oldest cryptocurrency network that recorded one billion transactions, another network that acts as the biggest rivalry for Bitcoin is Ethereum. It was launched in July 2015 and till then it has processed two billion transactions, as per the data shows. What Contributes To Count Bitcoin to One Billion TransactionsThis accomplishment of one billion signifies Bitcoin's longevity and dominance in the cryptocurrency market. The average daily transactions surged to 178,475 approx. with a notable increase due to the Bitcoin Halving Event and the launch of Bitcoin Runes.On 20th April 2024, the transactions recorded on a daily basis on average hiked after the Bitcoin Halving Event occurred. On 23rd April 2024, the high recording of 926,000 transactions counted authentically in the Crypto market.The demand of Bitcoin also rises after the Bitcoin Runes launched. Bitcoin Runes is a new token protocol built on the Bitcoin blockchain, enabling the creation and management of both fungible and non-fungible tokens. It utilizes the UTXO model, enhancing security and efficiency by managing tokens through unspent transaction outputs. Runes introduces various digital tokens directly on Bitcoin which potentially attracts more developers and users to the network. Bitcoin Runes launched during the Bitcoin halving event help to mitigate the impact on miners by increasing transaction fees. Coin Gabbar analyzes that Runes will benefit the Bitcoin network in the long run as it increases the transaction fees, by maintaining standards and attracting developers. Runes offers effective token management, potentially reducing strain on the Bitcoin network while complementing technologies like the Lightning Network. The adoption of Runes positively impacts the network as the block height reaches 840000. It increases the number of counts on Bitcoin transactions to one billion. Overall, Bitcoin's achievement highlights its continued significance and influence, even amid growing competition within the cryptocurrency market.Also Read: Pepe's Price Whizzing In The Cryptocurrency Market

Bitcoin privacy will survive despite CoinJoin closure - zkSNACKs CEO

The Bitcoin (BTC) ecosystem will soon lose an important privacy-enhancing service after zkSNACKs announced that it would discontinue its CoinJoin coordination service.Max Hillebrand, CEO of zkSNACKs, spoke exclusively to Cointelegraph following the announcement and explained that the decision was made to ensure compliance with the latest legal and regulatory updates in the United States. Hillebrand said the closure of the CoinJoin service was necessary given the lack of clarity in the U.S. over regulations pertaining to the cryptocurrency space and the use of privacy-enhancing tools. Former NSA whistleblower Edward Snowden was among commentators who lamented the service’s discontinuation.Source: Edward SnowdenThe zkSNACKs CEO said that the Bitcoin ecosystem was inevitably losing an important service that helped users transact with increased privacy through the coinjoin mechanism:“Bitcoin privacy will survive, but cutting back the support from zkSNACKs for Bitcoin developers and privacy educators is a regrettable setback.”Hillebrand also confirmed that Wasabi Wallet, the Bitcoin wallet developed by zkSNACKs that incorporated the CoinJoin service, will continue functioning as a regular BTC wallet. Users can generate private keys to receive and send Bitcoin.Coinjoins offer complete privacyDespite the closure of the CoinJoin service, Hillebrand said that Wasabi’s client-side filtering architecture, Tor integration and custom coin selection still provide significant privacy for users. However, the level of privacy afforded by CoinJoins remains unmatched going forward.“The nature of the Bitcoin blockchain prevents users from obtaining complete privacy without CoinJoins,” Hillebrand conceded.Related: Snowden goes after Bitcoin devs, Elon Musk and puppy killers in X flurryThe zkSNACKs CEO was hesitant to speculate whether similar crackdowns on privacy protocols and CoinJoin services would occur in jurisdictions outside the U.S.The closure of zkSNACK's CoinJoin coordination service also affected products and services across the ecosystem. Hardware wallet services Trezor Suite and BTCPayServer will no longer be able to offer the service to its users from June 2024.Cointelegraph has reached out to Trezor for comment on zkSNACKs' CoinJoin closure and whether it will consider using another Bitcoin privacy-enhancing service for its users.How does CoinJoin work?Hillebrand went into the details of zkSNACKs CoinJoin service during an in-depth interview with Cointelegraph at Bitcoin Amsterdam in 2023. As Hillebrand explained, a CoinJoin service offers an effective method for obfuscating Bitcoin transactions by combining multiple inputs and outputs from several users into a single transaction, making it significantly harder for outside observers to determine specific transaction details.Related: Trezor wallet enables Bitcoin privacy feature with CoinJoinWasabi Wallet was launched in 2018 following extensive research. The wallet uses Tor for anonymity, employs a light client approach for checking balances without compromising privacy, and utilizes block filters to efficiently and securely verify transactions without downloading the entire Bitcoin blockchain.Magazine: 68% of Runes are in the red — Are they really an upgrade for Bitcoin?

DOJ Cracks Down on Crypto-Linked Money Laundering


The US Department of Justice (DOJ) has escalated its crackdown on international money laundering. Authorities have indicted Maximilien de Hoop Cartier, allegedly linked to the Cartier family, for laundering drug proceeds through cryptocurrency.
In a parallel development, Alexander Vinnik, operator of the BTC-e crypto exchange, pleaded guilty to laundering over $9 billion. These efforts showcase the DOJ’s intensified efforts against financial crimes involving digital currencies.
Cartier Heir Entangled in Multi-Million Dollar Laundering Conspiracy
On May 2, the DOJ charged Maximilien de Hoop Cartier along with five Colombian nationals for their involvement in laundering drug trafficking proceeds between the US and Colombia using cryptocurrency. Claiming descent from the prestigious Cartier family, Maximilien was arrested in Miami. He is now facing a series of grave charges.
The officials accused him of conspiring to commit money laundering and engaging in money laundering activities, each charge carrying a potential twenty-year prison term. Cartier is also facing a bank fraud charge, which could result in up to thirty years of imprisonment.

Additionally, the authorities charged him with conducting a monetary transaction on property derived from specific unlawful activities, which could result in a possible sentence of ten years. Lastly, the DOJ also charged Cartier with operating an unlicensed money-remitting business, which could lead to five years in prison.
Cartier allegedly converted drug proceeds into the stablecoin Tether and then into US dollars. He utilized a network of shell companies and bank accounts in the US for these unlicensed transactions. This scheme involved running an unlicensed over-the-counter cryptocurrency exchange.

US Attorney Damian Williams expressed his thoughts regarding the case. He praised the relentless work of law enforcement and Office prosecutors in tackling money laundering and drug trafficking in Cartier’s case.

“Cartier is additionally alleged to have committed a series of financial offenses while working with this money laundering network that resulted in hundreds of millions of dollars’ worth of unlawful transactions. I commend the efforts of our law enforcements partners and the career prosecutors from this Office who work tirelessly to investigate and disrupt these money laundering and drug trafficking networks. We will continue to relentlessly protect the US financial system from exploitation,” Williams said.

Besides Cartier, several Colombian nationals are facing serious charges in this case. The DOJ accused Leonardo de Jesus Zuluaga Duque of conspiring to commit money laundering and to import over five kilograms of cocaine into the US. These offenses could result in a life sentence.
Similarly, Alexander Areiza Ceballos and Adrian Fernando Areiza Ceballos face charges of conspiring to import over five kilograms of cocaine into the US. This charge carries a mandatory minimum of 10 years and could lead to life imprisonment.
The authorities have also implicated Erica Milena Lopez Ortiz and Felipe Estrada Echeverry. They each face charges of conspiring to commit money laundering, a crime that carries a punishment of up to 20 years in prison.
BTC-e Exchange Operator Pleads Guilty
Moving on from Cartier’s story, another major development highlights the intricacy of global money laundering. On May 3, the DOJ’s officials announced that Alexander Vinnik, who was associated with BTC-e, had confessed to his involvement in a substantial money laundering operation.

BTC-e was once a notable player in the crypto exchange industry. The DOJ pointed out that BTC-e processed over $9 billion in transactions. Moreover, it served as a financial hub for cybercriminals, ranging from ransomware profiteers to drug traffickers.
Additionally, BTC-e failed to comply with US regulatory standards, including anti-money laundering and customer identification requirements. This failure made it a preferred platform for the anonymization of illicit proceeds.
In discussing Vinnik’s case, Deputy Attorney General Lisa Monaco stressed the international effort required to tackle such complex operations. She also underscored the global collaboration necessary for dismantling sophisticated schemes.

“This guilty plea reflects the Department’s ongoing commitment to use all tools to fight money laundering, police crypto markets, and recover restitution for victims,” Monaco added.

This announcement followed a report by BeInCrypto, which detailed charges brought by the DOJ against Aliaksandr Klimenka, a national of Belarus and Cyprus. The officials alleged he engaged in a complicated money laundering scheme through BTC-e. An indictment in February outlined that Klimenka, alongside Vinnik, managed BTC-e from 2011 until its closure in July 2017.

The recent actions against Cartier and Vinnik demonstrate the Department of Justice’s unwavering dedication. These efforts aim to safeguard the US financial system from the exploitation of high-level international money launderers.
Indeed, cryptocurrency is commonly associated with money laundering by authorities worldwide. However, recent research from Chainalysis in 2023 shows a notable decline in illicit cryptocurrency transactions. Illicit addresses sent $22.2 billion to services, down from $31.5 billion in 2022.

Contrary to the perception that cryptocurrencies are primarily used for money laundering, the US Department of Treasury’s report highlights that criminal organizations prefer traditional cash transactions for such activities. This finding indicates a lower risk associated with cryptocurrency in money laundering compared to conventional methods.

Bitcoin hits massive milestone: One billion transactions processed

Marking an incredible milestone in the history of the world’s first and most valuable cryptocurrency, the Bitcoin network has processed its 1 billionth transaction. That milestone moment came 15 years, four months, and four days after its pseudonymous creator, Satoshi Nakamoto, mined the network’s first block on January 3, 2009.Bitcoin growth and adoption Ever since the Bitcoin network was released 5,603 days ago, it never ceased its stride, churning out an average of 178,475 transactions every day. It is important to remember that this figure does not include the number of transactions routed through the Lightning Network, a Bitcoin layer-2 payment protocol designed to facilitate faster transactions.Again, figures from the Bitcoin-only exchange River suggest this is a lower bound estimate—that the Lightning Network cleared 6.6 million transactions in August 2023 alone. This means that since launching in January 2018, hundreds of millions of transactions should have taken place within the Lightning Network.Around the fourth halving event of the network, transactions had a daily all-time high of 926,000 transactions on April 23. This launch at block 840,000 brought demand for the Runes protocol.Market performanceThe Clark Moody Bitcoin dashboard claimed that more than 660,260 transactions were recorded on the blockchain in one single day, a number of new records. The same source also reports that transaction 1,000,000,000 got into block 842,241 at 9:34 p.m. UTC on May 5.Source: Clark MoodyEven though the Bitcoin network is the oldest in the history of cryptocurrencies, it is not the first to process a billion transactions. Its biggest rival, Ethereum, has processed well over two billion transactions since July 2015, according to Etherscan data.As of the time of this writing, Bitcoin exchanges hands near $63,750, up by more than 12% from the two-month low at around $56,800 on May 2, as tracked by CoinGecko. It still remains to be over 13.6% down from the all-time high set at $73,740 on March 13.Source: CoinGeckoIt’s remarkable that such a large number of transactions are processed within the Bitcoin network, which speaks to its strength and acceptance. The ecosystem of cryptocurrencies will only continue to grow from here, making it really interesting to see how Bitcoin, along with other digital assets, adapts to shaping the future of finance.

Ethereum (ETH) Whale Sales Surge: Are Whales Giving up on It? Ethereum (ETH)

Recent on-chain data and trading activity show that Ethereum whales are engaging in substantial sell-offs, raising concerns about their long-term confidence in the asset. One notable transaction involved a whale who, after purchasing ETH at $1,890 last year, moved 12,906 ETH ($24.39 million) from Binance to Lido.More recently, this same investor withdrew 7,000 ETH from Lido and redeposited it onto Binance, securing over $16 million in profits amid a fluctuating market.ETH/USD Chart by TradingViewThe accompanying charts reveal a decline in the number of large transactions alongside a fluctuating price, suggesting a possible correlation between whale activities and price movements. Specifically, the total volume of large transactions has seen a noticeable dip, aligning with periods of price instability.The profit-taking by whales may be influenced by Ethereum's relative underperformance compared to other leading cryptocurrencies like XRP and Solana. Although not drastic, Ethereum's sluggish pace on the fast-evolving crypto landscape could be prompting these large holders to reassess their positions. Such movements are critical to monitor as they can indicate a shift in investor sentiment, which might lead to more significant market adjustments.Additionally, on-chain metrics from IntoTheBlock show a significant correlation between the price of Ethereum and the number of large transactions. This relationship highlights how influential these large transaction volumes are to the price dynamics of Ethereum. The recent decline in transaction volume, especially in April, mirrors a drop in Ethereum's price, suggesting that selling pressure from whales is having an impact.While one significant sale does not spell doom for Ethereum, it raises some concerns about the sustainability of its current movements.

Binance Executive's Trial in Nigeria Postponed Again; Legal Delays and Global Scrutiny Intensify



                    

The trial of Tigran Gambaryan, a Binance executive detained in Nigeria, has been postponed again, this time until May 17, according to a recent announcement. 



Gambaryan has been held since February over allegations involving money laundering. 




A Reuters report from May 2 stated that Binance’s legal team did not receive necessary documents to proceed with the trial, initially slated to begin on the same day. 



The delay was confirmed by the presiding judge who adjourned the case to allow sufficient time for document review.



This case, which accuses Gambaryan and Binance’s regional manager Nadeem Anjarwalla of money laundering, is distinct from another set of tax evasion charges filed against them and Binance by Nigeria’s Economic and Financial Crimes Commission. 




All parties involved in the money laundering allegations have entered pleas of not guilty. 



Alongside the postponed trial, a bail hearing for Gambaryan has been scheduled for the same date, May 17.



The backdrop to these legal troubles involves a contentious visit by Anjarwalla and Gambaryan to Nigeria. 



Their trip was aimed at addressing accusations that Binance had manipulated Nigeria’s currency, the naira.

However, following their visit, both were detained on charges of tax evasion and money laundering. Anjarwalla managed to escape custody and has since fled to Kenya, where he also holds citizenship, in addition to the United Kingdom. 



On April 30, Interpol confirmed that extradition proceedings to return Anjarwalla were underway.



The timing of the arrests has drawn skepticism and criticism, especially as they coincided with Binance’s announcement to halt all transactions in the Nigerian naira. 



This move led to speculation about the motives behind the government’s charges. 



Binance has defended Gambaryan, asserting that he does not hold decision-making authority within the company.



Meanwhile, in the United States, a related criminal case has concluded with former Binance CEO Changpeng Zhao receiving a four-month prison sentence. 



On April 30, he was found guilty of failing to implement a proper Anti-Money Laundering program.



Zhao is scheduled to serve his sentence in a correctional facility in either Oregon or Washington, with the specific date yet to be confirmed.
