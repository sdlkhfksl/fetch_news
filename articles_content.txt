                        Communities across the web are pausing to reflect on the life of Kabosu, the dog behind the Doge meme and Dogecoin mascot, who passed away at 17 on May 25.Kabosu’s owner, Atsuko Sato, announced the news in a post on her official blog, expressing her deep gratitude for the love and support shown to her over the years.The passing came following an announcement that Kabosu was in a “dangerous position” healthwise in 2022. However, Sata expressed the passing to be peaceful, without suffering.“Soft light streamed in through the window, amidst the beautiful morning where birds sing, she gently passed away, as if falling asleep, while being stroked by me,” she said.Sato also announced a farewell gathering in honor of “Kabo-chan,” scheduled for May 26 at Flower Kaori in Kotsu no Mori, Narita City.The news has reverberated across the internet, uniting pop culture, meme culture, and crypto culture to remember the loss. Kabosu has undoubtedly stamped her mark on internet history.Doge’s History: From Meme, to Crypto, to Legend
Kabosu first gained widespread attention in 2010 when Sato shared photos of her adopted dog on her blog. A particular image of Kabosu, capturing her skeptical and curious expression, swiftly went viral and birthed the “Doge” meme phenomenon.This single image, accompanied by phrases in broken English, became a cornerstone of early meme culture.By 2013, the popularity of the foundational meme surged after Dogecoin was created, using Kabosu’s image as its official logo.Despite initially being intended as a joke, Dogecoin became a popular cryptocurrency. It became responsible for several charitable initiatives, including clean water projects and funding for the Jamaican bobsled team.This also normalized meme coins in the crypto space, resulting in the rise of some of the most popular meme coins. Many of these coins adopted the Shiba Inu as their mascot, paying homage to the original meme that sparked the trend.The original Doge image was also minted as an NFT in 2023. It sold for 1,696 ETH, worth $4 million.Since being sold, the NFT has been divided into billions of smaller, tradable units for fractional ownership.Her influence extends to political campaigns. For example, United States President Joe Biden’s reelection campaign announced hiring a “master of memes” on May 23.The Crypto Community Commemorates Kabo
The crypto community and fans of Kabosu have expressed their condolences, sharing tributes and favorite memories of the dog that became an internet legend.The official Shiba Inu token, competitor to Dogecoin, tweeted a heartfelt tribute underscoring Kabosu’s impact on crypto.When news of her ill health was released, Dogecoin co-creator Billy Markus asked his followers to send support. His call to action led to one user offering to cover “any expenses needed to make sure she gets the best treatment.”Kabosu’s legacy as the face of crypto culture will continue to symbolize community spirit and inspire future generations of meme enthusiasts.

Bitcoin Surges Above $70,000, Crushing Short Sellers with $85M in Liquidations



                    

Bitcoin surged above $70,000 on May 21 after intense buying pressure triggered a sharp price increase.



Data from Cointelegraph Markets Pro and TradingView indicated that BTC/USD was striving to maintain its newly regained ground at crucial psychological levels.




Bitcoin’s ascent towards the previous daily close was driven by significant buying liquidity, pushing the market close to $72,000.



This surge dealt a heavy blow to short sellers, with $85 million in BTC shorts liquidated in the 24 hours leading up to the report, according to data from CoinGlass.



Statistician Willy Woo commented on the situation, highlighting that bulls were confronting overhead resistance that had persisted for over a month.




“1 month of Bitcoin short position build up just got liquidated,” he told followers on X. “One more layer to go in order to short squeeze past all-time highs.”



A bold prediction even suggested that Bitcoin could reach $100,000 following a breakout on weekly timeframes.



Popular trader Skew speculated that the United States’ spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) might have influenced the move, anticipating “important days to come” ahead of the decision on U.S. spot Ether ETFs.



On the same day, ETH/USD traded near $3,700, up 18% in 24 hours and 25% over the week.Despite the surge in demand, popular trader and commentator Credible Crypto maintained a cautious outlook.




He emphasized that BTC price action was at “major resistance” and was unlikely to overcome it in the near term.



“No change to the plan – we are at major resistance atm with perp premium positive after a month and a half and funding the highest it’s been since – I clearly said these are not the conditions in which a move to the highs is conducive to the next major leg up imo,” he wrote in part of an X discussion.



CoinGlass indicated that $70,630 was the area with the thickest bid liquidity below the spot price at the time of writing.

Binance Completes Another Massive LUNC Burn, Here’s How Much Was Burned | Bitcoinist.com


								Binance, the world’s largest crypto exchange by volume has executed another large-scale Terra Classic (LUNC) burn, continuing its supporting role for the Terra Classic ecosystem. Despite the substantial supply reduction, the price of LUNC and its daily trading volume have been falling significantly. 
Binance Burns LUNC Tokens
On May 23, Binance initiated another LUNC burn separate from its 21st batch of LUNC burns on May 1. According to LUNC burn tracker, Terra Finder, the crypto exchange transferred about 29,828 LUNC tokens to a dead wallet, with a transaction fee of 11.33 LUNC. 

Typically, on the first of every month, Binance executes a large-scale LUNC burn worth thousands of dollars. On May 1, the crypto exchange burnt approximately 1.4 billion LUNC tokens, valued at around $140,000, recording a total burn of more than 57 billion at the time. 
Data from Binance’s LUNC tracker, ‘LUNC metrics’ have revealed that Binance’s total LUNC burn has increased to 59.07 billion LUNC tokens, representing approximately 51.9% of the total LUNC burned by the Terra Classic community. Additionally, the crypto exchange had begun its monthly burning cycle following Terra Luna’s crash in 2022, terminating over 59 billion LUNC tokens in 2,965 transactions. 
The highest LUNC burn executed by Binance was recorded on March 2, 2023. The crypto exchange has burned a whopping 8.84 billion LUNC tokens, significantly reducing Terra Classic’s token supply. 
Collectively, the total LUNC tokens burnt by the Terra Community has reached over 113.7 billion, with Binance being the leading contributor to the burns. The crypto exchange has been a fervent supporter of the Terra Classic community, consistently aiding the community to diminish the token’s staggering supply of approximately 6.79 trillion LUNC. 
Terra Classic (LUNC) Price On A Downtrend
Despite Binance and the community’s effort to reduce LUNC’s supply, the cryptocurrency’s price has remained low, recording a 2.15% decline in the last 24 hours. Usually, when a token’s supply is diminished, it induces scarcity, fueling price increases as demand for the token grows. 
However, with LUNC’s substantial token supply coupled with a 62.49% decline in its daily trading volume, the cryptocurrency has failed to witness any significant price increases. 

At the time of writing, the price of the cryptocurrency is trading at $0.00011, according to CoinMarketCap. Additionally, its stablecoin, TerraClassic USD (USTC) is also trading at a price of $0.022, reflecting a 3.32% decrease over the past 24 hours. USTC’s daily trading volume has also recorded steep losses, falling by 56.26%.  
These unexpected declines in the Terra Classic ecosystem follow Binance’s recent LUNC token burn, displaying an opposite bearish effect from a burning process meant to decrease LUNC’s total supply and potentially trigger a price rebound.

Bitcoin Whales Are Back to Buying Up BTC, Analysis Shows - Decrypt

We do the research, you get the alpha!Get exclusive reports and access to key insights on airdrops, NFTs, and more! Subscribe now to Alpha Reports and up your game!Go to Alpha ReportsThe appetite Bitcoin whales have for more coins has returned for the first time since the price of Bitcoin reached its all-time high in March, according to blockchain data.“They are now returning with a strong buying force again, indicating that the current prices are suitable for purchasing and accumulating despite the widespread fear,” market intelligence firm CryptoQuant tweeted on Friday.Analysts cited a rise in the 30-day percentage change in whale address holdings, alongside a rising total BTC balance held by whales. In on-chain terms, a ‘whale’ is the owner of any Bitcoin address holding between 1,000 BTC and 10,000 BTC, excluding those controlled by mining firms and crypto exchanges.“In general, whales buy Bitcoin at a faster pace during bull markets and decrease their buying when the market switches to a bear market,” CryptoQuant head of research Julio Moreno told Decrypt.Throughout March, whales had increased their BTC holdings by over 9.8%. They continued stacking in April, but their rate of accumulation slowed to just 4.2% by May 1, at which time Bitcoin’s price had cratered over 20% from its highs to under $57,000.As of May 22, the metric had returned to 5.5%, meaning whale accumulation was back on the rise after the market bottomed. In early May, CryptoQuant CEO Ki Young Ju noted that whales had scooped up 47,000 BTC during the drastic market dip.Bitcoin’s price has lifted to $68,760 as of this writing, up about 3% for the week.According to Moreno, the amount of money invested in Bitcoin by whales has more than doubled from $57 billion to $122 billion since the start of the year. This is measured by observing whale owners’ “realized cap”—the total value of all whale coins based on the time that each coin was bought, rather than their current market value.Lead Glassnode analyst James Check said on Wednesday that the Bitcoin network’s total realized cap has now reached an all-time high of $578 billion, “meaning the fundamentals of Bitcoin have literally never been stronger.”“In my view, we're quite far from the true euphoria phase of this bull market,” Check added. “You could argue we're on the boundary between enthusiasm and excitement, but not yet euphoric.”Edited by Ryan Ozawa.Daily Debrief NewsletterStart every day with the top news stories right now, plus original features, a podcast, videos and more.

Solana (SOL) Plummets 10%, Here's Why, Ethereum ETF Effect: Will It Kick In? Cardano (ADA) Brand New Support Level

Solana lost around 10% of its value in an unexpected manner. The asset that looked well-positioned for the rally after the preliminary approval of the Ethereum ETF is currently looking weaker than the rest of the market, and it's not clear if it's going to recover properly.Examining the chart, Solana experienced a sharp decline, dropping from around $176 to $164. This significant drop has brought SOL down to test its support level at $160, which has previously acted as a strong support area. If this level fails to hold, the next major support lies at $150, corresponding with the 200-day moving average (orange line).SOL/USDT Chart by TradingViewOn the resistance side, Solana faces immediate resistance at $176, a level it struggled to maintain before the recent drop. Above this, the next key resistance is around $190, where the 50-day moving average (blue line) currently resides. Breaking through these levels would be necessary for any substantial recovery.Several factors could be contributing to Solana's decline. First, market sentiment following the Ethereum ETF approval has been mixed, with some assets benefiting while others like Solana suffer. Additionally, technical factors such as failing to maintain key resistance levels might have triggered stop-loss orders, accelerating the sell-off.For traders and investors, the $160 support level is critical. If Solana can maintain this level, it may consolidate and attempt another upward move. However, if it breaks below $160, the next significant level to watch would be $150. This could indicate further downside potential, and investors might need to brace for more volatility.Ethereum stays composedThe expected kick in price that many attributed to Ethereum's ETF effect turned out to be a fiasco. There are quite a number of factors that could be responsible for bringing out such poor price performance, although, for the time being, the more important question remains: could there be price growth ahead, rather than talks about the failed rally?Ethereum, until this point in time, had not been able to really breach key resistance levels, even after ETF approval. Critical reasons behind this are the kind of approval — it was not the full-blown S-1 type — and, hence, the doors for further regulatory issues are still open. Besides, the Division of Trading and Markets gave this consent under delegated authority, which is subject to challenge over the next 10 days. All this amounts to some additional uncertainty that adds to the overall position of the markets. But it is not all bad over the long term. The plain fact that any acceptance of an Ethereum ETF, even partial, sets a precedent in this space and sets off further potential and larger instances of crypto adoption. Cardano's weird positionCardano is not the most noted asset in the market, does not bring much volatility and, therefore, did not form very noticeable moves in previous weeks. However, we can see some potential here because ADA is approaching a major support, which can afterwards serve as a base for a reverse.At this point, the chart is showing Cardano establishing a new level of support around $0.45. This level has been tested several times and has held up under the pressure of the downside, perhaps pointing to some real interest in that price. The volume spike on this new movement definitely strengthens the case for this to be an important level for the price. If ADA can hold onto this level, it might serve as a nice base upon which to initiate an upward move.On a daily chart, ADA has its immediate resistance located at $0.50. This is a price level at which the ticker has seen rejections in the onward price action for the last couple of days. One critical thing to note is that once breached, the current fanatical rally could see a target at $0.55, exactly where the 200-day moving average lies.

Bank Employee Steals $2,100,000 From Customers, Spawns Web of Unauthorized Transactions and Illicit Accounts: DOJ Indictment - The Daily Hodl


								The U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) is accusing a bank employee of creating a web of unauthorized transactions and illegal accounts, stealing more than $2.1 million from customers.
In a 17-count indictment, the DOJ says it’s charging Yue Cao of Winfield, Illinois, with alleged bank fraud, aggravated identity theft and engaging in monetary transactions in criminally derived property in connection with a scheme to steal funds from identity theft victims’ accounts.










Between May 2022 and April 2023, Cao is accused of defrauding an unnamed Ohio-based bank where he worked and its customers by transferring their funds to accounts that were under his control, including accounts he had established in the customers’ names, all without their knowledge or authorization.
Cao allegedly diverted the stolen money from the customer accounts for his own personal use, according to the DOJ.
The agency says Cao was a “quantitative modeling analyst,” and was able to use his position to find customers who hadn’t yet enrolled in online banking services – mostly the elderly – and sign them up using their names with fake email addresses without their knowledge.
Once the customers were unwittingly enrolled in online banking, Cao allegedly used those accounts to make at least $2.1 million in unauthorized online transfers from the victims’ real accounts to the accounts he had opened in the victims’ names and to his own financial accounts.
The case was investigated by the FBI’s Cleveland Division, and is being prosecuted by Assistant United States Attorney Edward Brydle.

Hedge Funds Are Net Short On Bitcoin Futures Even As BTC Bulls Take Over Options Markets


								There is nothing for Bitcoin holders and traders to write much about prices in recent days. Although there was excitement after May 20, the coin has been printing discouraging lower lows, cooling off from the impressive $71,900 zone to less than $68,000 at press time. As BTC drops 7% from this week’s high, hedge funds appear to be exiting.
Hedge Funds Are Shorting Bitcoin Futures On CME: Are They Really Bearish?
According to Kaiko, a blockchain analytics platform, the latest data from the United States Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) showing Commitment of Traders (COTs), reveals that hedge funds are net short across leading BTC futures products on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME).

This development could suggest that the “big boys” think the uptrend is over now that bulls failed to follow through this week, confirming gains of May 20.

Looking at price action, the uptrend remains, though bears risk peeling off all gains early this week. Technically, buyers have a chance only if there is a shift in tune among bulls, pushing prices ideally above $68,000 and later $70,000. From the daily chart, buyers must breach $72,000 if they have any chance of conquering bears and breaching all-time highs printed at around $74,000.

While the United States CFTC COT report points to a net short position for hedge funds in Bitcoin futures on CME, Kaiko also thinks it might not be a straightforward bet on prices to tank. Instead, the blockchain analytics platform believes institutional investors engage in “basis trade.” This strategy exploits arbitrage trades, capitalizing on price differences on spot and future platforms. 

Being “net short” on CME means hedge funds are likely “long” on their basis trade. This means they are simultaneously shorting BTC futures contracts and doubling down on the spot BTC. The goal here is not only for profits but also to create a buffer, a hedge against volatile prices. 
BTC Bulls Dominate The Options Market
Still, confidence remains high based on the options data shared by Kaiko. As the month comes to a close, Kaiko notes that most Bitcoin options volume is heavily concentrated on contracts expiring on May 31 and June 28. Most of these options contracts are “calls,” that is, traders expected prices to rise before expiry.

Kaiko notes that the highest volume strike price for BTC contracts expiring on May 31 is $80,000, with a notional value of nearly $910 million. Extrapolating from this, most traders expected BTC to surge above $80,000 by the end of the month.

Blockchain Gaming Altcoin Axie Infinity Flashing Signs of Potential 194% Surge, Says Crypto Trader - Here’s Why - The Daily Hodl


								The blockchain gaming altcoin Axie Infinity (AXS) is flashing signs that it could be ready to take off on a massive surge upwards, according to a popular crypto trader.
The analyst Ali Martinez tells his 62,600 followers on the social media platform X that it looks like AXS is forming an inverse head-and-shoulders pattern on its weekly chart.










Martinez says the pattern “anticipates AXS to rise toward the neckline at $13 before a potential breakout to $22.”
Source: Ali Martinez/X
An inverse head and shoulders pattern is a technical formation with bullish implications. The right shoulder suggests that bulls are willing to accumulate the asset without waiting for the price to drop to its previous low.
With AXS trading at $7.49 at time of writing, a surge to $13 would represent an increase of more than 73%, and hitting $22 would be a boost of nearly 194%.
Martinez is less bullish on Ethereum in the short term: The trader says the Tom DeMark (TD) Sequential Indicator presented a sell signal on ETH’s daily chart on Thursday, suggesting the asset could suffer a 5% correction.
Source: Ali Martinez/X
Traders use the TD Sequential Indicator to predict potential trend reversals for tokens based on the closing prices of their 13 previous bars or candles.
ETH is trading at $3,828 at time of writing.

                        As major cryptos remained stuck within recent ranges as traders digest Ethereum ETF approvals and hotter-than-expected US economic data released this week, traders are turning to the on-chain markets as they hunt for the top crypto gainers today.Bitcoin (BTC) was last trading just below $69,000, up 4% this week.Ethereum (ETH), meanwhile, is changing hands in the $3,700s, up over 21% this week.Both cryptos are currently trading 4-5% below earlier weekly highs.Ethereum ETF approvals are an important bullish catalyst, but macro headwinds appear to have scuppered the market’s momentum.As blue-chip cryptos struggle, traders are turning to alternative assets as they hunt volatility.And the on-chain markets are the perfect place to make quick gains or losses.Here are some top crypto gainers today on Ethereum decentralized exchanges (DEX), as per DEXScreener.Top Crypto Gainers TodayEGOD (EGOD)A new meme coin paying respects to the death of Kabosu, the Shiba Inu dog that inspired the creation of Dogecoin, called EGOD (EGOD) has sprung up on Friday and is performing well.The token was last up 15,900% since its launch, as per DEXScreener.Its market cap was last around $1.1 million, with $200,000 in liquidity.Degen Smerf (SMERF)A new shitcoin called Degen Smerf (SMERF) is up 7,800% since its launch, as per DEXScreener.Its market cap was last around $300,000, with $70,000 in locked liquidity.While the token only has one issue in its smart contract, as per a Go+ Security audit, that doesn’t mean its not a scam.Traders need to remember that nearly all newly launched coins are either scams or pump-and-dumps. Traders must do their due diligence before getting involved.Harambe (HARAMBE)Elon Musk tweeted out to commemorate the death of Kabosu, saying he is in heaven with Harambe.That has spurred the creation of a new Harmabe meme coin. It was last up 10,400%, as per DEXScreener, with a market cap of $1 million.The token has $176,000 in locked liquidity and two concerning issues with its smart contract.Better Alternative to Consider
Investing on newly launched meme coins is fraught with risk.Yes, some of these coins might 100x. But the vast majority will fall flat, and investors might never be able to find the liquidity to sell.Their fast price action tends to trigger FOMO in traders, who neglect to do the required due diligence.A potentially better alternative to investing in just-launched meme coins is to invest in presales.Here, traders have more time to research a project and see if it is a good fit for them.Indeed, if a trader can reliably identify projects that end up gaining tract, they can make big gains.Analysts at Cryptonews keep a close eye on the presale market.

Gala Games CEO Blames Internal Controls for $23 Million GALA Token Hack



                    

Gala Games’ CEO attributes a recent security breach, which led to a hacker stealing and selling $23 million worth of its GALA token, to “messed up” internal controls.



On May 20 at 7:32 pm UTC, blockchain analysts noticed that 5 billion GALA tokens, valued at $200 million at the time, were minted. The responsible wallet sold these tokens in batches.




The breach caused GALA’s price to plummet by 20%, hitting a 24-hour low of $0.038. However, the price has since rebounded slightly to $0.041, according to CoinGecko.



“We had an incident that resulted in the unauthorized SALE of 600 million […] GALA tokens and the effective BURN of 4.4 billion tokens,” stated Gala Games co-founder and CEO Eric Schiermeyer in a May 20 post on X (formerly Twitter).



“We messed up our internal controls,” he continued. 




“This shouldn’t have happened, and we are taking steps to ensure it doesn’t happen again.”



Schiermeyer revealed that Gala identified the compromise and removed unauthorized access to the GALA contract. 



He reassured users that the Ethereum contract “is secure” and “was never compromised.”

Gala believes it has identified the person responsible and is collaborating with the FBI, the U.S. Justice Department, and international authorities, Schiermeyer noted.



In another post, Gala Games stated that the “security incident involving the GALA token has been contained and the impacted wallet has been frozen.”



Neither Gala Games nor Schiermeyer disclosed the identity of the individual responsible for the breach or the method used to gain access to the GALA contract.



Gala Games did not respond to a request for comment on the incident.



In a related development from August, Schiermeyer and fellow co-founder Wright Thurston filed lawsuits against each other. 



Thurston accused Schiermeyer of causing Gala to “sell off and waste millions of dollars in company assets,” while Schiermeyer claimed Thurston stole $130 million worth of GALA tokens.

Shiba Inu See Spike In Net Flows Following Listing On Solana-Focused Exchange, Is This Positive? | Bitcoinist.com


								Shiba Inu (SHIB) is again gaining bullish momentum, suggesting that a significant rally might be on the horizon for the meme coin. This is thanks to recent developments that have painted a positive outlook for the crypto token. 
Shiba Inu Sees Spike In Netflows
Data from the market intelligence platform IntoTheBlock shows that Shiba Inu has seen a notable increase in net flows, which have risen to as high as 379.61 billion SHIB tokens in the last 24 hours. This indicates that a lot of whale activity is currently going on in the Shiba Inu ecosystem. 

An increase in whale activity suggests that this category of investors is accumulating the meme coin ahead of a potential price surge. Moreover, these investors are also known to trigger a rally in Shiba Inu’s price with their significant purchases. Meanwhile, the rise in SHIB’s net flows could also mean a massive demand for the meme coin among retail investors. 
Crypto trading platforms like Robinhood, which also doubles as Shiba Inu whales, are known to move huge sums of the meme coin into their platforms to meet customers’ demands. Interestingly, this recent surge in net flows follows the recent listing of the meme coin by the Solana-focused crypto exchange Backpack. 
Given Solana traders’ general interest in meme coins, it will be no surprise if Backpack has witnessed a huge demand for the Shiba Inu token on its platform, which has led it to accumulate a significant amount of SHIB tokens. 
Meanwhile, some other on-chain metrics paint a bullish picture for Shiba Inu. Data from IntoTheBlock shows a 0.32% increase in Net Network Growth, meaning more users are adopting the meme coin. The Concentration metric, which tracks whales’ positions, has also turned bullish, meaning that these investors are adding to their positions. 
Could The Market See A SHIB ETF Soon?
Shiba Inu’s lead developer, Shytoshi Kusama, recently discussed the possibility of a SHIB ETF while congratulating the Ethereum team on the approval of the Spot Ethereum ETFs. He questioned if this event could pave the way for a fund that holds the meme coin. Crypto expert Anthony Pompliano seems to believe so, as he claimed before the approval order came in that approval would mean “they are approving the entire industry.”

Interestingly, earlier this year, the Shiba Inu community had petitioned asset manager Grayscale to launch a Shiba Inu ETF. With the Spot Ethereum ETFs in the bag, the community could again pick up such enthusiasm and push Grayscale or any other asset manager to apply to launch this Shiba Inu ETF. 
This process isn’t expected to be straightforward, though. Bloomberg analyst James Seyffart had previously suggested that any crypto token that will have its ETF needs to be first listed for futures trading on a regulated platform like the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.

Ethereum Classic surges 17%: A shadow rally amid ETH ETF buzz? - AMBCrypto



Ethereum Classic’s price increased by more than 3% in the last 24 hours.
ETC was awaiting its fourth halving, which is scheduled for the 31st of May.

All eyes remained on the king of altcoins as the US SEC approved exchange applications to list spot Ethereum [ETH] ETFs. But Ethereum Classic [ETC] silently stole the show as it registered a promising price increase in the last few days. 
Does this mean a fresh rally for ETC? 
Ethereum Classic’s response to ETF approval
The US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) recently approved ETH ETFs listing on 23rd May. Since then, this has been a top topic of discussion, but ETH’s price witnessed a correction soon after.
However, Ethereum Classic reacted in a different manner. According to CoinMarketCap, ETC was up by over 17% in the last seven days. In fact, in the last 24 hours alone, the token’s value surged by more than 3%. 
At the time of writing, ETC was trading at $32.07 with a market capitalization of over $44.7 billion. 
Thanks to the price increase, its social volume also shot up, reflecting its popularity. Additionally, its weighted sentiment remained in the positive zone. This meant that bullish sentiment continued to be dominant in the market.

Ethereum Classic awaits halving 
All this happened while Ethereum Classic was awaiting its fourth halving, which is scheduled to happen on the 31st of May. The last ETC having happened on the 11th of May 2020. 
The event can stir up bullish sentiment and allow the token to maintain its upward trajectory over the coming days.
Source: Nicehash
To see whether metrics also supported a continued bull rally, AMBCrypto analyzed Santiment’s data. We found that ETC’s trading volume surged substantially along with its price.
 This can be considered an optimistic development, as a rise in volume acts as the foundation for a bull rally. 
On top of that, its open interest also remained relatively high. This suggests that the possibility of the current price trend continuing is high. 
Source: Santiment
Apart from these metrics, Ethereum Classic’s Money Flow Index (MFI) also registered a sharp uptick, hinting at a further price rise. 
However, not everything looked perfect as its Relative Strength Index (RSI) moved southwards. Additionally, ETC’s price also touched the upper limit of the Bollinger Bands, which could cause trouble.

Read Ethereum Classic’s [ETC] Price Prediction 2024-25

If ETC actually turns bearish, then investors might witness the token’s price falling to $29. At that level, ETC will have an opportunity to rebound. 
A further drop in price could push the token down to $27. However, if the bull rally continues, then it is likely for ETC to first touch $34–$35 in the coming days.

Mysterious Whale Withdraws $8 Million in $PEPE Tokens Amid Memecoin Surge | Cryptoglobe


                                
A mysterious cryptocurrency whale has made a splash on the memecoin market after moving nearly $8 million worth of $PEPE from Binance, effectively withdrawing 592 billion tokens after the recent price rise.



According to on-chain analytics firm Lookonchain, the whale likely bought the tokens as the price of PEPE surged. PEPE, it’s worth noting,  recently moved to new highs, having recently briefly surpassed the $0.000014 mark before correcting slightly. Its gains came amid a wider cryptocurrency market rally that added over $200 billion to the space’s total market capitalization.



The catalyst for the broader market surge appears to be news related to the potential approval of spot Ether exchange-traded funds (ETFs) in the U.S as the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has abruptly requested that the exchanges that want to list and trade these funds update key filings related to these products, fueling speculation that the regulator is considering approving these products.







The surge saw an early investor in the meme-inspired cryptocurrency who put in just over $460 when it was first launched cash out, realizing a gain of nearly 740,000% after their $460 appreciated to around $3.4 million.







            
            

            
            

            
            

        

Looking into the wallet of the trader, data shows that the trader often invests in newly launched memecoins hoping one will take off. The investor was early on several popular memecoins, but also seemingly on several memecoins that faded away soon after being launched, according to Etherscan data.



PEPE’s upward trend has attracted the attention of some cryptocurrency analyst, with popular trader Altcoin Sherpa noting that those looking for a “big cap meme to long” should consider PEPE as it has “good liquidity, strong volume.”







DonAlt, another popular analyst, warned of a potential bubble in the memecoin market, with valuations susceptible to dramatic corrections. Citing historical data, DonAlt predicted that popular memecoins, including PEPE, could experience crashes exceeding 80%.

Dogecoin ($DOGE) Price Soars 10% as Whales Dive Back In: Meme Coin Mania Returns? | Cryptoglobe


                                
The meme-inspired cryptocurrency Dogecoin ($DOGE) has recently seen its price surge by more than 10% over the last week amid growing activity from large cryptocurrency investors, colloquially known as whales, that shows growing interest in the cryptocurrency.



According to data from blockchain analytics firm IntoTheBlock, DOGE whale transactions – those exceeding $100,000 worth of the meme-inspired cryptocurrency – nearly doubled in a single 24-hour period after speculation surrounding the potential approval of spot Ether exchange-traded funds grew.







The data also reveals a rise in the volume of DOGE moved by these whales, climbing from 9.74 billion to 17.97 billion over the same period.



Adding to the intrigue, a long-dormant Dogecoin whale holding 893,303 DOGE (around $145,101) moved their funds after a decade of inactivity at about the same time, marking the whale’s first transaction since May 2014, involving the transfer of 23,338 DOGE, worth roughly $4,000, to Binance, the world’s leading cryptocurrency exchange.











            
            

            
            

            
            

        

While the whale retains the majority of its holdings (869,964 DOGE, valued at over $140,000), this movement has sparked concerns about potential price fluctuations.



Historically, the re-emergence of early cryptocurrency investors has often coincided with significant price swings. The recent transfer to Binance could be interpreted as a potential precursor to selling activity, further fueling speculation about DOGE’s future trajectory.



As Cryptoglobe reported, DOGE has formed a chart pattern that suggests the price of the cryptocurrency may surge over 23,000%, akin to a rise it experienced last year when the same pattern was formed on its chart.



The chart pattern was first spotted by popular cryptocurrency analyst Ali Martinez, who noted on social media that on Dogecoin’s weekly chart a descending triangle has formed. The last time Dogecoin encountered this pattern, it catapulted with an almost unfathomable rally of 23,200%. This revelation has stoked speculation about whether Dogecoin could reproduce a similarly meteoric rise.

Bitcoin Money Launderer Sentenced To 6 Years Behind Bars In $6B Scam | Bitcoinist.com


								A recent report by the Financial Times reveals that a British-Chinese woman, Jian Wen, has been sentenced to six years and eight months in prison for her involvement in laundering Bitcoin (BTC) allegedly derived from a £5 billion fraud in China. 
Wen, aged 42, was convicted in March of one count of money laundering on behalf of her former boss, Yadi Zhang, a Chinese woman. The sentencing took place at London’s Southwark Crown Court on Friday.
London Mansion Raid Uncovers £3 Billion Bitcoin Stash
According to the report, in 2018, London’s Metropolitan Police conducted a raid on Wen and Zhang’s Hampstead mansion. During the raid, they seized devices containing a staggering 61,000 Bitcoin, currently valued at over £3 billion. Notably, this seizure marked one of the largest cryptocurrency hauls ever made by a law enforcement agency worldwide. 

Authorities had originally investigated Wen concerning an attempted purchase of a London mansion using Bitcoin. Prosecutors in the UK alleged that Wen’s former boss, Zhang, ran a £5 billion fraud scheme in China, resulting in stolen funds.
While Zhang’s lawyer has maintained her innocence, Wen was convicted of laundering a portion of the proceeds between 2017 and 2022 after two trials and acquittals on 10 other counts. It is important to note that Wen was not implicated in the original alleged fraud. 
However, Judge Sally-Ann Hales, KC, emphasized that Wen had full knowledge of dealing with the proceeds of crime and described the offense as “sophisticated with significant planning” involved. 
Wen, who allegedly assisted in converting Bitcoin into cash, jewelry, luxury items, and property, pleaded not guilty and consistently denied being aware that her employer’s funds were stolen.
Letter Urges UK-China Negotiations
Mark Harries KC, Wen’s lawyer, described her as a “fragile and desperate woman” who was deceived and manipulated. However, the judge disagreed with this characterization, stating that she did not consider Wen a victim. 
Wen admitted to controlling a Bitcoin wallet but claimed ignorance regarding the cryptocurrency’s source. The court heard that Wen had not seen her 16-year-old son for 26 months and has been in custody since March 2022.
Between 2017 and 2020, Wen enlisted the assistance of several intermediaries to convert the cryptocurrency into various assets. 
One such intermediary was Michael James Burke, a Dubai-based estate agent, who reportedly aided Wen in selling Bitcoin through his companies in the Seychelles and Switzerland and facilitated property purchases in Dubai. 

The Metropolitan Police is pursuing a civil recovery process to seize the total amount of confiscated funds and is collaborating with Chinese authorities on the matter.
“The Chinese side has already engaged in international law enforcement cooperation with the UK concerning this case,” stated the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs in response to the Financial Times. 
The ministry added that law enforcement agencies from both countries are actively working together to pursue fugitives and recover assets. Victims of the alleged £5 billion scam in China have also submitted a letter to the foreign ministry in Beijing, urging negotiations with the UK government to reclaim the Bitcoin purchased with their money.

Dogecoin Weighted Funding Rate Falls 50% In 24 Hours, What This Means For Price | Bitcoinist.com


								Dogecoin, like the rest of the crypto market, has seen a slow down over the last day that has greatly impacted its price. However, this slowdown isn’t completely limited to the price as the open interest-weighted funding rate of the meme con has seen a significant decline over the last day.
Dogecoin OI-Weighted Funding Rate Crashes 50%
Over the last few days, as the Dogecoin price rose, so did the OI-weighted funding rate. This is normal, given that the funding rate follows market sentiment. In times when crypto traders are very bullish, the funding rate rises as long traders have to pay short traders to keep their positions open. Then, when sentiment is skewed toward bearishness, funding rates tend to drop, and short traders pay long traders to keep their positions open.

This is important as the funding rates help exchanges to keep contract prices and their underlying asset prices balanced no matter the market conditions. These fees are charged at intervals by the exchanges, but the duration between each charge varies from exchange to exchange.
Having explained that, it tells us that the drop in the Dogecoin OI-weighted funding rate is a show of bearishness among investors. When the Dogecoin price hit $0.17 on Thursday, the OI-weighted funding rate touched 0.0243%. However, as the price has dropped back down toward $0.16, the OI-weighted funding rate has now dropped to 0.0105%, according to data from Coinglass.
Source: Coinglass
This drop is a more than 50% decline from its Thursday figures and shows how fast sentiment can turn on a cryptocurrency such as Dogecoin. However, if the Dogecoin price does begin to recover once again, then the OI-weighted open interest will rise.
Open Interest Falls Alongside DOGE
Amid the decline in the Dogecoin price, the open interest has also taken a hit as well. Its recovery to almost $1 billion on Wednesday, May 22, has been rocked by a 10% crash that has sent it back down toward $900 million once more.
The majority of this decline came in the last 24 hours, where Coinglass data shows that the Dogecoin open interest saw massive losses across all major exchanges. The largest drop in open interest came from the Kraken crypto exchange, dropping 35.94%.

This was followed by dYdX with an 18.57% drop, and Coinbase with an 11.36%. Other exchanges saw varying declines between 1.25% and 7.4%, and in total, the open interest has dropped 5.31% in the last day. The total open interest is now sitting at $907.8 million.
Dogecoin’s price is currently trending at $0.1587, with a 4.59% decline in the last 24 hours. Honorable mention of Kabosu, the Shiba Inu dog behind the infamous Dogecoin logo, who recently passed away.

                        The Southwark Crown Court in London, UK, sentenced a woman to jail for money laundering bitcoin tied to a billion-dollar investment fraud.Jian Wen was sentenced to nearly seven years in prison on Friday after being found guilty of money laundering in connection with a £5 billion ($6.4 billion) fraud scheme.Woman Jailed for Laundering $6.4 Billion Bitcoin Fraud Proceeds in London Court TrialAccording to Bloomberg reports, Jian Wen, a former fast-food worker, has been sentenced to six years and eight months in prison for laundering significant amounts of Bitcoin associated with a US$5.6 billion investment fraud in China. The case saw Wen convicted of money laundering linked to approximately 150 Bitcoin for a Chinese woman between 2017 and 2022. Law enforcement authorities seized over 61,000 Bitcoin valued at over US$4 billion.During Friday’s sentencing, Judge Sally-Ann Hales remarked that the offense was sophisticated and involved substantial planning, stating, “I am in no doubt that you knew what you were dealing with.”Despite holding British and Chinese citizenship, Wen consistently denied all allegations against her and is currently appealing her conviction. She portrayed herself as a victim who merely followed instructions from a woman, insisting she was unaware of the funds’ fraudulent origins. Her lawyers further portrayed Wen Jian as another victim of the mastermind behind the fraud, labeling the individual as an “expert criminal supervillain” who exploited Wen Jian’s trustworthiness before discarding her.However, the prosecution argued that Wen was motivated by greed and financial gain, asserting she played a decisive role in managing the crypto wallet linked to the laundering scheme. Prosecutors described Wen Jian as a “front person” utilized by the fraud mastermind to convert stolen funds into bitcoin, move them out of China, and convert them back into cash. Wen Jian maintained her innocence, claiming she was simply trying to provide a better life for her son, denying three counts of money laundering, and claiming she did not know Bitcoin’s criminal origins. Despite her claims, jurors found her guilty of one count in March, while two other counts resulted in a hung jury.In March, a jury found Wen guilty of one count of money laundering after a trial that spanned nearly two months, during which thousands of pieces of evidence, including WhatsApp messages between Wen and the alleged mastermind, were presented.Wen Jian Sentenced to Six Years and Eight Months for Money Laundering in High-Profile Fraud Case
Wen, 42, experienced a dramatic transformation in her lifestyle, transitioning from living in the basement of an east London Chinese takeaway to residing in a six-bedroom mansion in a leafy suburb and indulging in luxury shopping sprees at Harrods after she began working for the now-arrested female fugitive. Judge Hales noted, “I am in no doubt that you came to enjoy the better things in life.”In a separate statement, Wen’s lawyer refuted the allegations of fraud against her, asserting that she acquired substantial holdings of Bitcoin through lawful means.Judge Sally-Ann Hales emphasized that while there was no evidence of Wen Jian’s involvement in the underlying fraud but she was aware she was dealing with criminal proceeds. She sentenced Wen Jian to six years and eight months in prison for a single count of money laundering.Recently, the EU passed a new anti-money laundering regulation (AMLR) aimed at regulating crypto-asset service providers (CASPs). This regulation empowers Financial Intelligence Units (FIUs) to detect and combat money laundering and terrorist financing.The legislation package, announced on Wednesday, will impact crypto exchanges and brokers operating under the Markets in Crypto-Assets Regulation (MiCA). These laws introduce “enhanced due diligence measures,” requiring obligated entities such as crypto-asset managers to report suspicious activities to FIUs.Also, a new supervisory body, AMLA, will oversee implementation. This broad AML/CFT framework applies to all financial institutions, including CASPs, and is not specific to crypto.

Lido (LDO) Takes The Lead With 13% Surge Post Ethereum ETF Approval - Key Levels To Watch


																Lido (LDO), the liquid staking protocol for the Ethereum (ETH) and Polygon (MATIC) blockchains, has seen a significant price spike in the last 24 hours following the long-awaited approval of spot Ethereum ETF applications by the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) on Thursday.
The protocol’s native token, LDO, has successfully regained the $2.30 level and is looking to break out of its one-month downtrend structure that has been in place since the market correction in April. 
LSD Sector Set To Soar With Ethereum ETF Approval?
As reported by our sister website, Bitcoinist, the SEC’s approval of the Ethereum ETFs was detailed in an official filing, highlighting that the proposals meet the provisions of the Exchange Act and relevant regulations governing national securities exchanges. 
The Commission has determined that proposals from notable entities such as BlackRock, Grayscale, Bitwise, VanEck, Ark Invest/21Shares, Invesco Galaxy, Fidelity, and Franklin Templeton fulfill the requirements to prevent fraud and manipulation, protect investors, and safeguard the public interest.

	Related Reading


Crypto analyst Daan Crypto Trades, commenting on the Ethereum ETF approval on X (formerly Twitter), pointed out that the new index funds approval has led to two sectors emerging as clear winners. 
One of these sectors is Liquid Staking Derivatives (LSD) coins, with Lido at the forefront. Lido provides staking support for the Ethereum blockchain without the need to lock tokens or maintain infrastructure, allowing participants to engage in on-chain activities such as lending and farming.
Key Levels To Watch For Lido
During the early hours of Friday, LDO reached a peak of $2.49 but has since retraced to its current trading price of $2.35. Large investors are interested in the token, as Spot On Chain data reveals that six fresh wallets/whales withdrew 4.3 million LDO ($9.59 million) from crypto exchange Binance over the past 24 hours. 
This indicates a growing interest in holding the token, as sentiment suggests a potential increase in price parallel to Ethereum once the newly approved index funds for the second-largest cryptocurrency enter the market in the coming months.
Moreover, CoinGecko data shows that Lido has experienced a trading volume of $350 million within the last 24 hours, marking a 78.60% increase compared to Thursday’s. However, the token remains 68% below its all-time high (ATH) of $7.30, achieved during the 2021 bull market.

Looking ahead, bullish investors should closely observe the next resistance level on the LDO/USD daily chart, situated at $2.55. Breaking this level is crucial for breaking the downtrend structure that has persisted over the past month, potentially leading to retests at $2.70 and $2.90.
Conversely, the $2.21 zone serves as a significant support level, as it acted as a strong barrier for Lido in the past week and a half before the breakout.

FTX Co-Founder Sam Bankman-Fried Transferred To New Detention Center, Details | Bitcoinist.com


								According to a Bloomberg report, Sam Bankman-Fried, the co-founder of the FTX crypto exchange, has been transferred to a temporary detention center in Oklahoma, contrary to a federal judge’s request to keep him in New York to assist in his appeal. 
The move comes as Bankman-Fried navigates the aftermath of his conviction for orchestrating a significant fraud at FTX.
Sam Bankman-Fried Transferred To Oklahoma 
According to the report, Sam Bankman-Fried is currently housed at the Federal Transfer Center in Oklahoma City, as stated on the Bureau of Prisons website. He spent much of last year preparing for his trial while incarcerated at the Metropolitan Detention Center in Brooklyn, New York. 
Judge Lewis Kaplan, who sentenced Bankman-Fried to 25 years in prison, recommended on Wednesday that he remain in Brooklyn “until his appeal has been fully briefed to facilitate access to appellate counsel.”

Curiously, Sam Bankman-Fried, who had publicly announced his intention to appeal the conviction, officially objected to the decision at the end of April. 
In a post-conviction interview, he voiced concerns about the fairness of his trial and specifically targeted Sullivan & Cromwell, the law firm representing FTX’s new owners. 
The disgraced FTX co-founder accused the firm of colluding with the prosecution and impeding his access to crucial FTX documents shared with the prosecution. 
Sam Bankman-Fried asserted that this interference had a “detrimental impact” on the trial, including media coverage and the defense’s ability to present favorable evidence.
Closer To Family While Serving Sentence? 
With the appeal now officially filed, Bankman-Fried seeks a different outcome, hoping for a reduction in his sentence. He emphasized the importance of introducing vital evidence and presenting key witnesses, which he claims his defense was denied the opportunity to do during the trial. 
Mark Botnick, a spokesman for Bankman-Fried, expressed gratitude for the court’s consideration and hoped that the Bureau of Prisons (BOP) would abide by the court’s recommendation to grant Bankman-Fried access to his appellate counsel.

According to the report, Sam Bankman-Fried may eventually be transferred to a prison closer to his family in California to serve the remainder of his sentence. The Oklahoma facility, classified as a transfer center by the Bureau of Prisons, is designed to hold inmates for a limited period of four to six weeks.

Ethereum Goes to Wall Street | Bankless


1️⃣ ETH ETF Approved in a Break-Neck PivotThursday marked another historic event with the SEC approving eight spot Ethereum ETFs from institutions like BlackRock, Franklin Templeton, Fidelity, and VanEck. While these approvals signal a regulatory shift, especially after the complete 180 the agency seemed to pull, trading can't commence until the S-1 registration statements are approved, which may take weeks. While the ETFs are expected to attract billions in capital, further boosting institutional interest in crypto, it seems like the next few weeks to months may be the quiet before the storm. 2️⃣ House Passes CBDC Anti-Surveillance State Act and FIT21Also on Thursday, the U.S. House of Representatives passed the CBDC Anti-Surveillance State Act, blocking the Federal Reserve from issuing a central bank digital currency without Congressional approval. The bill, supported by 213 Republicans and 3 Democrats, aims to align any U.S. CBDC with American privacy values and free market competitiveness — essential given the potential for these tools to significantly compromise individual rights to freedom. Meanwhile, the House also passed the Financial Innovation and Technology for the 21st Century Act (FIT21), empowering the CFTC alongside the SEC to regulate the digital assets market.

The Big SEC Surprise | Bankless


Approval Relief. Ethereum’s spot ETF was shockingly approved and the crypto market landscape will never be the same! What happened this week in markets?With the SEC’s first final decision for an active spot ETH ETF application scheduled to occur on Thursday, market participants came into the week expecting significant volatility… Although consensus overwhelmingly held that spot ETH ETFs would be denied come this deadline, rumors that the SEC was unexpectedly communicating with issuers began circulating on Monday.The prior absence of any meaningful communication had pushed market participants to prepare for denial, but the sudden reversal caused Bloomberg’s ETF analysts to increase their odds of approval threefold to 75%!Renewed confidence in renewal sent traders scrambling to long ETH, causing the ETH/BTC ratio to surge back above the key level at 0.05 and resulting in outsized Ether strength throughout the week (or at least until ETF approval).Many crypto market participants had long clung to beliefs that BTC was a special type of digital asset and would be the only one to receive regulatory clarity as a non-security, however, indications that the ETH ETF could be approved blew a hole in this narrative and confirmed that BTC will need to compete among other digital assets for TradFi’s attention.The loss in BTC’s narrative strength can be clearly observed in the charts; Bitcoin Dominance had its worst week since the arrival of spot BTC ETFs enabled redemptions for the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) and led to sell pressure that drove token price under.Unfortunately, the approval of the ETH ETF marked peak strength for alts. The ETH/BTC wicked as low as 7% off its Thursday approval highs and Bitcoin was one of the market’s lone gainers on Friday as traders rotated out of assets that outperformed leading up to Ether’s ETF approval.While this week’s headlines proclaimed “ETH ETFs Approved,” there remains a minute possibility the SEC could walk back its green light, as the approvals came per “delegated authority” by SEC staff, which a commissioner can challenge within 10 days. Nevertheless, Bloomberg Senior ETF Analyst Eric Balchunas has dismissed these concerns outright. Alternatively, traders may be wary of the potential sell pressure that can be expected from the $10B AUM Grayscale Ethereum Trust (ETHE); its conversion into a spot ETF enables redemptions and allows the instrument to trade at par for the first time in three years.The core doctrine of laser-eyed BTC maximalists may have experienced a crushing fundamental defeat now that it appears that any digital asset – no matter how it originated – can become a non-security, but leaders of this cult are holding steadfast in their beliefs that there is still no second best.

XRP Poised for Breakout? Analyst Sees Major Move After US Crypto Bill | Cryptoglobe


                                
XRP, the native token of the XRP Ledger, could soon see a breakout from its current level around $0.53 after the US House of Representatives passed landmark cryptocurrency legislation and ahead of the end of Ripple’s legal battle with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).



That’s according to popular pseudonymous cryptocurrency analyst Dark Defender, who pointed to the landmark cryptocurrency regulation bill the US House of Representatives passed this week,  Financial Innovation and Technology for the 21st Century Act (FIT21).



The proposed legislation is poised to create a framework for the regulation of the cryptocurrency market in the US, including implementing consumer protections, designating the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) as the primary regulator for digital assets, and outlining explicit responsibilities for both the CFTC and the SEC. Furthermore, it aims to provide a more distinct classification of a cryptocurrency as either a security or a commodity.



The bill has garnered strong support from the cryptocurrency industry with the Crypto Council for Innovation, a consortium of entities and companies in the sector, such as Coinbase, Kraken, Andreessen Horowitz, and the Digital Currency Group, along with 50 other organizations, writing a letter to the Speaker of the House, Mike Johnson (R-La.), and the Minority Leader, Hakeem Jeffries (D-N.Y.), advocating for the bill’s approval.







            
            

            
            

            
            

        

The analyst used technical analysis tools  like Fibonacci Time Zones and Elliott Wave Theory, to project a significant price increase for XRP before July, suggesting the recent bill, and the entrance of institutional investors in the space through spot exchange-traded funds could further bolster XRP.







The analyst also suggested that Ripple’s legal battle with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, which started after the regulator sued the fintech firm and two of its executives alleging they “raised over $1.3 billion through an unregistered, ongoing digital asset securities offering,” could soon end.



Notably, the analyst has earlier this month suggested XRP’s price could soon explode to as much as $18 after identifying a bull flag pattern on the XRP/USD chart.



The bull flag, characterized by a sharp price increase followed by a period of consolidation, appears across multiple timeframes, including monthly, three-month, and six-month charts, the analyst noted. The consolidation period, marked by converging red and blue trendlines, forms a triangle – a technical indicator often interpreted as a precursor to a breakout.

VanEck's Spot Ether ETF Listed on DTCC, Awaiting SEC Approval Amid Speculation and Political Influence



                    

Amid growing anticipation regarding the approval of a spot Ether exchange-traded fund (ETF) in the United States, global investment manager VanEck’s ETF has been listed by the Depository Trust and Clearing Corporation (DTCC) under the ticker symbol “ETHV” as of May 23.



The DTCC, an American financial market infrastructure provider, offers essential clearing, settlement, and transaction reporting services to financial market participants. 




Being listed on the DTCC is a significant step towards receiving final approval from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).



Currently, VanEck’s ETF is marked as inactive on the DTCC website, meaning it cannot be processed until it secures the necessary regulatory approvals. 



Notably, VanEck is not the first to list an Ether ETF with the DTCC; Franklin Templeton’s spot ETH ETF was listed on the platform a month earlier.



The DTCC clarified that their ETF list includes both active ETFs ready for processing and inactive ones awaiting approval.

In a related development, there are reports that SEC officials have contacted Nasdaq, the Chicago Board Options Exchange, and the New York Stock Exchange to update and revise existing spot Ether ETF applications.



The apparent shift in the SEC’s stance over the past week is believed to be influenced by the White House.




Crypto lawyer Jake Chervinsky observed on X that policy is influenced by politics, noting, “For months, crypto has been winning the political battle.” 



He also speculated that former President Donald Trump’s endorsement of cryptocurrency might have prompted the Biden administration to adjust its policy.




The SEC faces a crucial deadline on May 23 for its decision on VanEck’s spot Ether ETF application.



After months of speculation about a likely denial of spot ETH ETFs, the SEC recently took significant action. 



The Commission requested financial managers to amend and resubmit their 19b-4 filings for proposed spot Ether ETFs. 



Some analysts interpret this move as a positive sign, increasing the likelihood of approval from 25% to 75%.

China's Digital Asset Ban Remains Ignored With Recent Increase in Money Laundering Cases - Coincu



	

Key Points:




Despite China’s digital asset ban, recent police raids reveal significant illicit transactions involving digital assets.



Cryptocurrency demand persists in China, fueled by factors such as the desire for alternative investments and evasion of capital controls.



Traders employ sophisticated methods, including peer-to-peer platforms and overseas company setups.




According to Bloomberg, recent police raids in China targeting illicit foreign exchange transactions have exposed the ongoing use of cryptocurrencies despite China’s digital asset ban.





Persistence of Cryptocurrency Demand Despite China’s Digital Asset Ban



These actions highlight the persistent demand for cryptocurrencies in the country, driven by various factors including the desire for alternative investments and the circumvention of capital controls.



In May alone, several significant cases involving cryptocurrencies were flagged by municipal authorities and state media. These included an underground bank involved in illegal transfers amounting to 13.8 billion yuan ($1.9 billion), a gang implicated in about 2 billion yuan of unauthorized conversions, and illegal money changers with transactions exceeding 1 billion yuan. The busts spanned across Beijing, the northeastern province of Jilin, and Chengdu city in the southwest.



China’s digital asset ban was initially deployed in September 2021 due to concerns over money laundering, currency outflows, and the environmental impact of energy-intensive Bitcoin mining. Despite this, Chinese citizens continue to engage in significant volumes of underground crypto trading.




Sophisticated Evasion Tactics Enable Continued Crypto Trading in China



According to blockchain analytics firm Chainalysis, approximately $86 billion worth of cryptocurrency flowed into China in the 12 months through June 2023. While this represents a decline from pre-ban levels, it remains substantial on a global scale.



The persistence of cryptocurrency trading in China is facilitated by various methods to evade detection. Traders use software to mask their locations and peer-to-peer platforms such as WeChat and Telegram for transactions. Some individuals set up companies abroad through intermediaries to meet institutional know-your-customer (KYC) requirements on crypto exchanges, further complicating enforcement efforts.

Ethereum Pectra Upgrade Expected to Launch in Q1 2025 - Coincu



	

Key Points:




Ethereum will launch the Pectra upgrade by Q1 2025, incorporating EOF, PeerDAS, and EIP-7702 to enhance performance and efficiency.



Pectra introduces new opcodes, improving staking efficiency and accelerating cryptographic operations.



The Ethereum Pectra upgrade will modify the deposit and withdrawal process and regulate capital requirements for validators.




Ethereum core developers are preparing to launch Pectra, the next major upgrade for the blockchain network, by the end of the first quarter of 2025.





Ethereum Pectra Upgrade Launch Targeted for Q1 2025



Ethereum Pectra upgrade aims to introduce several significant improvements and innovations, furthering the development and efficiency of Ethereum.



Pectra will encompass multiple Ethereum Improvement Proposals (EIPs), including the EVM Object Format (EOF), PeerDAS, and EIP-7702. EOF, a set of about 11 EIPs, introduces an opt-in container for EVM code to enhance performance and efficiency. PeerDAS, or Peer-to-Peer Decentralized Autonomous System, will facilitate decentralized peer-to-peer interactions on the network.



EIP-7702, introduced by Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin, is set to replace the older account abstraction EIP-3074, aiming to improve network functionality and performance. The upgrade may delay the implementation of Verkle Trees to a subsequent hard fork named Osaka.




Validator Adjustments and Enhanced Staking Efficiency with Pectra



Pectra’s name combines two simultaneous upgrades targeting different Ethereum layers: Prague, which updates the execution layer responsible for enforcing protocol rules, and Electra, which enhances the consensus layer to ensure block validation. This multifaceted approach underscores Ethereum’s commitment to continuous improvement and innovation.



Additionally, Ethereum Pectra upgrade will introduce new opcodes, improve staking efficiency, and accelerate cryptographic operations. It will also include EIPs related to the deposit and withdrawal process and adjust the capital requirements for validators, potentially reducing their number and increasing operational efficiency.

BitGo Lawsuit Against Galaxy Digital Allowed by Court to Continue - Coincu



	

Key Points:




The Delaware Supreme Court has reversed an earlier ruling, allowing BitGo lawsuit against Galaxy Digital to continue.



The court found the merger agreement’s language ambiguous, requiring extrinsic evidence to resolve the dispute regarding audited financial statements.




According to CoinDesk, BitGo has been granted a new opportunity to pursue legal action against Galaxy Digital over their aborted $1.2 billion merger agreement.





Delaware Supreme Court Revives BitGo Lawsuit Against Galaxy Digital



The development follows the Delaware Supreme Court’s decision to overturn a previous ruling that dismissed BitGo’s $100 million lawsuit against Galaxy Digital.



The Supreme Court’s May 22 decision shows the ambiguity in the merger agreement’s language and the need for extrinsic evidence to resolve the dispute. This ruling reverses the June 2023 decision by the Delaware Court of Chancery, which had ruled in favor of Galaxy Digital by their “clean termination right” due to BitGo’s delay in providing audited financial statements for 2021.



R. Brian Timmons, a partner at Quinn Emanuel, the law firm representing BitGo, expressed satisfaction with the Supreme Court’s decision, stating, “We believe justice prevails on appeal, and we are delighted to move forward with this case in the Chancery Court.”




BitGo Alleges Intentional Breach as Galaxy Defends Termination Decision



Initially, BitGo lawsuit appeared in August 2022, accusing Galaxy Digital of an “intentional breach” of the acquisition agreement. BitGo sought $100 million in damages, citing that Galaxy backed out of the deal due to financial difficulties amid the crypto bear market rather than any fault of BitGo’s. Conversely, Galaxy maintains that its decision to terminate the merger was justified by BitGo’s failure to provide necessary audited financial statements on time.



The merger, announced by Galaxy CEO Mike Novogratz in May 2021, was called off in August 2022. The dissent centers on the interpretation of financial statements required under the agreement.



Delaware Chancery Court Vice Chancellor J. Travis Laster initially ruled in favor of Galaxy, citing non-compliant financial documents provided by BitGo. However, the Supreme Court’s recent ruling identified the definition of financial statements as ambiguous, necessitating further examination and thus reviving BitGo lawsuit.

‘I Feel Super Confident About That’: Jack Mallers Says Bitcoin To Explode by up to 1,357% - Here’s the Timeline - The Daily Hodl


								The CEO of Bitcoin (BTC) wallet and payments application Strike, Jack Mallers, is predicting that the flagship crypto asset could hit a seven-figure price.
Mallers says in a new interview with Anthony Pompliano that Bitcoin could soar between 260% and 1,357% in the coming months.










“I think we’re still so early in the Bitcoin story. I’m publicly on record saying I think Bitcoin hits $250,000 to $1 million in this cycle. So now I’m speaking the next 10 to 18 months.”
Bitcoin is trading at $68,653 at time of writing.
Mallers predicts that the US government will be forced to turn on the money printers to pay the bills on its record-high $34.577 trillion debt. Mallers says that the ensuing currency debasement will provide the catalyst needed to send Bitcoin soaring to his astronomical price target.
“I think people would be willing to pay $250,000 for a Bitcoin based on the mess that I think… I mean, there’s a massive hole and there’s a loss that has to be realized. That loss is going to come through debasing the currency. Asset prices are going to go up and what is the best asset and the best-performing asset? What’s the best money in human history? And so I think that has to be accurately priced.”
The Strike CEO also says that he feels “super confident” about his big price target for BTC.
“People are too fixated on the cost of capital as far as rates. They need to be more fixated on the amount of capital which is they’re still printing dollars. It doesn’t matter that rates are at 5.5% – it’s still inflationary.
And so for those reasons… how am I supposed to predict the most fixed asset in the history of mankind against the biggest f***ed-up problem that central banks have ever had to try and solve? I mean, come on $250,000 to $1 million. I feel super confident about that.”

Pepe Fuks Biden (PEPEFBID) Will Explode 16,000%, As It Looks to Challenge Shiba Inu and Dogecoin



                    

Pepe Fuks Biden (PEPEFBID) could become a viral memecoin, like Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE).



Pepe Fuks Biden (PEPEFBID), a Solana memecoin that was launched this week, is aiming to challenge other memecoin giants, such as Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE).




Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Pepe Fuks Biden presents a similar opportunity.



Pepe Fuks Biden has a market cap below $15,000 at the moment, meaning that when it just reaches a modest market cap of $400,000-$800,000, early investors would generate returns of 2,000%-5,000% in a matter of days or hours.



The exciting memecoin is poised to rally 11,000% in the coming two days, and Pepe Fuks Biden could potentially reach a multi-million dollar market cap within a few weeks.



Currently, Pepe Fuks Biden can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jupiter and Raydium, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days.



To buy Pepe Fuks Biden on these platforms, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Pepe Fuks Biden by entering its contract address – 4D3CzRs6n4hPrHJsqon5oDVKRe8nhaiBL1mQGowzhPvg – in the receiving field.



In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price.



If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner.




The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum.



This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like PEPEFBID.

The importance of liquidity in the crypto market

On the crypto market, liquidity is a very important parameter. 
Indeed, among all the parameters, it is the one that individually can have the greatest impact on prices, in addition to individual events of systemic importance. 

The role of liquidity in financial markets
With the term “liquidità” we refer to those assets that can be traded on the market very easily and quickly. 
The most liquid instrument of all is money, also because it was created specifically to be easily exchangeable in an extremely rapid manner. 
There are also assets that are extremely difficult to sell, such as those that are locked until a certain date. 
The more an asset can be easily and quickly sold, the more it is considered liquid, therefore there are different degrees of liquidity. 
Money is the most liquid asset that exists, while for example physical gold is a bit less liquid. A property by its very nature is not very liquid, because it takes a while to sell it, while some assets can even be totally illiquid if they cannot be spent at all (such as seized funds).
On financial markets, in general, the assets that are traded are liquid, except for those that cannot be transferred because they are restricted. 
But even in financial markets, there are different degrees of liquidity. 
In particular, when we talk about financial markets with real liquidity, we mean money, and those assets that are nothing more than highly liquid different forms of money. 
In other terms, in financial markets, liquidity is simply constituted by the most liquid assets. Among these are cash, both in physical and digital form, and those very short-term investments considered equivalent to cash. 
Liquidity in the crypto market
Il mercato crypto è solamente una porzione del mercato finanziario generale. 
So what applies to traditional financial markets also applies to crypto markets, regarding liquidity. 
What changes, however, are precisely the assets that are considered liquid in the crypto market. 
Just like in traditional financial markets, in the crypto market an important part of the liquidity is made up of fiat money. 
Tuttavia, a differenza di quanto comunemente si pensa, sui mercati crypto il denaro fiat non è quello più facilmente e velocemente spostabile. 
For example, to withdraw or deposit fiat currency on exchanges, it takes from a few minutes to a few days, while with other assets the movement is easier and faster. 
Ecco così che sul mercato crypto la maggior parte della liquidità è composta da token che replicano le valute fiat, ovvero dalle cosiddette stablecoin. 
To tell the truth, there are also stablecoin not pegged to fiat currencies, such as tokenized gold, but nowadays the term stablecoin is often used as a synonym for tokenized fiat currencies. 
The majority of liquidity in the crypto markets is made up of tokenized fiat currencies, or stablecoin, with fiat money following in second place. In third place are algorithmic stablecoin, while any other forms of liquidity in the crypto markets are practically absent. 
How liquidity moves
On financial markets, the most important thing regarding liquidity is not the amount present, but the speed at which it is traded. 
For example, if a billion dollars were traded only once a day, it would have a lower impact than a million dollars traded more than ten times a day. 
The sudden movements of liquidity that shift from one asset to another are the true culprits of price volatility. 
In general, however, regarding long-term price trends, the overall liquidity variation matters a lot. For example, between 2020 and 2021, when the Fed injected more dollars into the financial markets in less than two years than there were in total in 2019, the result was a generic strong and sudden rise in all prices. 
In other terms, the increase in liquidity tends to generate inflation, because it actually triggers an increase in purchase demand. 
Therefore, in the medium-long term, the variations in overall liquidity matter a lot, while in the short term, how quickly it moves matters more. 
For example, cash money held idle in a bank account does not generate the slightest volatility in the financial markets, whereas if it is spent to purchase financial assets it can generate a price increase. 
The current crypto situation: market and liquidity
One data point that can help understand the current liquidity level of the crypto markets is the trading volumes in stablecoin. 
Among other things, it should be noted that practically every day the cryptocurrency that records the highest trading volumes is USDT, which is absolutely one of the most liquid. 
Tendenzialmente i volumi di scambio giornaliero di USDT sui mercati crypto (circa 100 miliardi di dollari) sono doppi rispetto a quello di Bitcoin e Ethereum (entrambi attorno ai 50 miliardi), e di circa 10 volte superiori a quelli della seconda maggiore stablecoin, USDT (10 miliardi). 
Sui mercati finanziari tradizionali il volume di scambio complessivo di USD è enormemente superiore, tanto che ad esempio il singolo titolo Nvidia sta facendo registrare volumi di scambi giornalieri non molto distanti da quelli di USDT sui mercati crypto, e quasi doppi rispetto a quelli di Bitcoin o di Ethereum. 
Taking instead as a reference the overall trading volumes in all cryptocurrencies, the crypto market in recent days is recording a daily trading volume exceeding 100 billion dollars, but at the beginning of May it was only 70. 
During the peak in mid-March, they had risen to 150, which is well below the all-time highs of 300 billion dollars traded, for example, on April 19, 2021. 
In other words, the liquidity circulating in the crypto markets actually varies from day to day, even if with not exaggerated variations, but it varies especially from period to period, with large jumps during the bullrun, and strong contractions during the bear-market. 
Note that these variations not only affect volatility but also prices, and it is precisely for this reason that when there is less liquidity, prices tend to be low, while when liquidity rises, it also tends to increase prices.

Airdrop season in arrivo a giugno: gli ultimi aggiornamenti crypto

In June, a myriad of crypto airdrops are expected: after the Securities and Exchange Commission approved Ethereum spot ETFs, several projects have planned to launch their own governance token shortly, taking advantage of the current wave of optimism and enthusiasm.
First of all zkSync, Ethereum’s L2 zkrollup scaling solution, which according to some rumors would release its own token ZK in mid-June.
Are we officially in the airdrop season phase? All the details below.

The launch of the zkSync token $ZK could inaugurate the airdrop season in June
As mentioned, the most watched crypto project of the moment by airdrop hunters is the zk-rollup zkSync Era network, controlled by the blockchain development company Matter Labs.
As reported by the information site The Block, on Tuesday, May 21, as soon as the L2 developer saw the probabilities of the approval of the Ethereum spot ETF increase, they sped up the TGE process, trying to launch their governance token as soon as possible.
Even though the official confirmation from the zkSync team has not yet arrived, according to internal sources at The Block, it seems that the scheduled date for the airdrop is around June 13, or in any case before the Blast token airdrop scheduled for June 26.
the ticker chosen for the cryptocurrency of the project is ZK (while many expected ZKS), which has fueled quite a few controversies since the same ticker was chosen by the Polyhedra Network team, which, however, has never seen a listing on Binance.
The same ZK token, expected at most 30 days after the TGE, is already being traded in premarket on platforms like Aevo, after the reference price is around 0.60 dollars.
Considering that according to rumors, the zkSync coin will have a supply of 21 billion tokens, with a price per token of 0.60 dollars the FDV would reach 12.6 billion dollars.
Source: https://app.aevo.xyz/perpetual/zk
It is not the first time that speculations have been fueled regarding the long-awaited airdrop of this Ethereum L2: last week, the same zkSync team hinted at a symbolic launch and airdrop by the end of June, saying that it will soon implement an update to accelerate the decentralization of its protocol.
“The imminent release of v24 is the final planned protocol upgrade necessary before handing over network governance to the community,” stated zkSync last week. “The remaining missing pieces should be in place by the end of June.”
Il lancio di ZK potrebbe inaugurare ufficialmente l’airdrop season di giugno.
With a TVL of 872 million dollars according to L2Beat and several hundred million dollars in VC funding obtained from Andreessen Horowitz (a16z), Dragonfly Capital, Blockchain Capital, Crypto.com Capital, Placeholder Capital, and 1kx, the zkSync airdrop could offer significant rewards to its early adopters.
Some might, however, be left out given the large participation of the farmers: in total there are over 3.4 million active addresses, 8.1 million transactions, 15 billion dollars in bridged value, and almost 3 million bridgers.
Source: https://dune.com/gm365/L2
In any case, according to some users on X, that of zkSync could be the largest airdrop of all time in terms of value given to the community, potentially even better than that of Arbitrum.
Noi del team di The Cryptonomist, have been talking about it since May 2023.
We remain waiting to receive more information directly from the project team. Probably as early as next week, the checker will arrive to check which addresses are eleggibili to claim the reward.

All the upcoming crypto airdrops: which projects can you still qualify for?
Besides zkSync, many other projects are about to launch their own crypto on the market by initiating an airdrop to their respective communities, taking advantage of the positive wave in the crypto market.
One of the most anticipated launches concerns the interoperability protocol LayerZero, which has already announced snapshot n°1 on May 1st, indicating that ZRO will soon be officially listed within the crypto markets.
Here too the large participation of airdrop hunters, of which a large portion is verosimilmente a large slice sybil, has forced the project to identify criteria that will discard a significant portion of the users of the omni chain technology.
Tuttavia, considerando i prezzi in pre-market, ci si aspetta una FDV del token ZRO almeno a 15-20 miliardi di dollari al lancio, tale da riuscire a fare arricchire diversi utenti che si sono posizionati già diversi mesi fa.

Il mercato delle criptovalute è noto per i suoi cicli di bull e bear. Durante un mercato bull, i prezzi tendono a salire rapidamente, mentre in un mercato bear, i prezzi scendono. Gli investitori devono essere preparati a navigare attraverso entrambi i tipi di mercati.
Anche il protocollo di restaking Swell is about to launch the airdrop of its namesake token SWELL, with the TGE that would be imminent according to the project’s team.
While other competitors like Etherfi and Renzo have already played their cards, with the tokens ETHFI and REZ already present on the crypto exchanges, Swell has waited for the most opportune moment to introduce its asset on the crypto exchanges.
With a recent tweet, the protocol announced that it has increased the allocation planned for the airdrop from 7% to 8%, aiming to increase public engagement during a moment of euphoria for the entire EVM sector.
The SWELL coin has been tradable in pre-market for about a month, and an FDV of approximately 1.34 billion dollars is hypothesized at launch. The “pearls” points should be valued at around 0.5 dollars.

Worth noting is also what was revealed this week by Taiko, a based-rollup sequenced by Ethereum, which announced the arrival of its own token TKO with the launch of the airdrop checker. 
Eligible users have until May 29 to check their eligibility and 30 days to execute the claim once it is open to the public.
Click on this link to check the eligibility of your addresses.
TKO is already trading in pre-market at a price of about 2 dollars, bringing the FDV valuation around 2 billion dollars.
In this case, some users reported a positive allocation for the airdrop of Taiko, with rewards worth at least 1500 dollars while others reported poor allocations compared to the time and fees spent to grow the project.

Il mercato delle criptovalute è noto per i suoi cicli di bull e bear. Durante un mercato bull, i prezzi tendono a salire rapidamente, mentre in un mercato bear, i prezzi scendono.
There are then a wide range of secondary projects that could take advantage of the positive momentum of the airdrop season by launching their own cryptographic coins.
Among these, the most likely for an airdrop in June are: DeBridge, Debank, BItget Wallet, Syncswap, Blast, Orbiter, and others.
Instead, the next big projects on which it is still possible to take actions to qualify for the airdrop are Linea and Scroll, both l2 of Ethereum that could launch a token by the end of the year.

The power of Quantum Computing


One of the exponential technologies that is not yet getting its fair share of love from the general public and media is Quantum computing. In the past few years, I had the privilege of spending time discussing it with people from CERN and the Fermi Lab, but my conversation with Scott Crowder, Vice President IBM Quantum Adoption and Business Development, had the right mix of theory and real-life examples, which will make anyone understand the potential of this field of research and its business applications. AI will keep its hype for a good while, as we see from its pervasive presence in every corner of the internet. Quantum can be the next big thing. This is our dialogue. 
Who are you and what do you do for a living?
My name is Scott Crowder, and I run IBM’s Quantum efforts to boost its adoption, together with our partners and industry clients. Our goal is to build a useful Quantum computing infrastructure and to help the world make a Quantum-safe transition, in the next ten years or so. I am an engineer by training and had worked on semi-conductors in the past, before taking on the role of CTO for IBM Systems. With Quantum, it’s the first time where we have a ‘use first’ attitude, where we try things with partners, we teach and learn with our clients, before we scale-up projects. It’s interesting and it’s fun.  
What are the three ‘killer’ use cases for Quantum, for what we know now?
Firstly, simulating nature, like materials’ science – new materials, or chemistry, for example better battery chemistry, to mention something that is very ‘hot’ right now. We do physics simulations or try to understand how complex proteins would behave. These are operations that entail higher computing power than what we could do with today’s computers. 
Secondly, we try to find patterns out of complex data. For example, a classification of a piece of data as fraud or not. If there is some structure in the data before us, Quantum computing is much better than classical computers to give meaning to it and even pick up things like false positives. This is extremely useful, if we want to make sense of the world.  
Lastly, I would say, portfolio optimization, finding efficiencies, and distribution optimization. There are direct and huge applications here, for multiple industries. Think of the mobility or logistics markets, for example. This third use case is slightly farther out from us, in terms of time to market, when compared to the first two. 
Where are we really, when it comes to Quantum adoption in the real world?
To simplify it: Quantum is better at doing what it does best, namely simulations. For sure, to do it at scale, larger systems are needed. So, we are looking at 2030 and beyond. What we are doing now is, let’s say, algorithmic explorations. We work with a mix of partners: heavy industry conglomerates, banking, pharma, transportation, and startups. And, obviously, universities and research institutions. 
Big Tech is also into Quantum, even though the talk of the town is AI. Intel, Microsoft, Google, AWS: all have investments and programs in Quantum, with different approaches to it.
What is the future business model of Quantum? How are you going to sell it?
It’s hard to say right now. We must make some assumptions. It’s probably going to continue to be, in the medium term, a cloud service, where partners have access to the Quantum capabilities we have built, via API calls, and they can interact with our experts, who help with the prototyping and the training. Basically, it’s going to be the same as a standard cloud business model. There will be ad hoc projects for sure, where the stakes are high, and we can unlock tremendous economic value. In a way, the approach is more like how we weave CPUs and GPUs into a compute fabric, and not via a single application per se, like a Chat GPT for Quantum. 
What would you say is the number one risk associated with Quantum?
Cybersecurity is for sure the number one risk. Future, more powerful Quantum computers will crack at some point the current asymmetric cryptography, which protects public and private information, for example (mobile data, payments, medical records, etc…). The math for that already exists. There are Quantum-safe cryptography solutions, but a full ecosystem of security providers and coding will need to change, to account for the Quantum shift, and to make sure we have a Quantum safe era.
Where can we find you and learn more about Quantum?
A simple search for anything related to IBM Quantum will do. I am also active on social media, like LinkedIn. IBM writes a lot of articles on Quantum. We need to talk about it publicly, and have people understand this is real, and it has great potential to bring tremendous value to society and business, across all industries. You may think this is science fiction, as it’s going to hit us in our next decade, but it is a new way of approaching complex problems. It could help other applications and use cases, as well, like AI, and this is why it’s the right moment to talk Quantum.

NFT fest + TECH fest + WUF: 3 festivals in a single weekend on art and new technologies in Lugano in the Canton Ticino (Switzerland)


This year Lugano triples the offer of festivals linked to new technologies. After the experiences of past years, the time had come to provide some vertical content for the different communities and the different interests linked to the world of digital avant-garde.
On 14 and 15 June 2024 in Lugano there will be:
NFT fest: dedicated to Web3 communities, and to fans of NFTs in all its multifaceted forms;
TECH fest: focused on the world of start-ups, investors and the latest technological innovations;
WUF: acronym for “We Understand the Future”, a vertical format on new art forms linked to the latest technologies.
All of which forms the Lugano Digital Weekend, which will spread across the entire city and the Canton Ticino.
Thanks to the collaboration between FFS and Lugano Living Lab (the city’s digital laboratory), entry tickets to events will also be valid as transport tickets on public transport within the entire Arcobaleno fare community for the duration of their validity. Tickets can be booked at www.nft-fest.com. Participants will thus have the opportunity to easily reach Lugano from all over Ticino using the public transport network for FREE.
The epicenter of the various festivals will be the town hall and its Piazza della Riforma (main city square). Inside the courtyard of the municipal building there will be keynotes and podcasts from industry representatives and major influencers. And like last year, it will also be an opportunity to discuss and “clash” on the various sensitive and important, and sometimes divisive, topics that concern technological innovation.
Above all, there will be space for innovations and the city will anticipate some strategic activities undertaken to facilitate the re-location of technological start-ups in the area.
Dozens of side-events in those days, in a city that stands out for its vibrant activity in the month of June. At the gates of summer, on the lake, with a Mediterranean climate, schools just finished and lots of people around the city.
Michele Foletti, mayor of Lugano declares:

“The courage demonstrated several times by the city of Lugano inspires new initiatives on technological innovation and artistic avant-garde in the digital world. We are proud to involve more and more people in our territory, which today is talked about in the world”.

Roberto Gorini, organizer of NFT fest and TECH fest reiterates that:

“Lugano demonstrates once again that it firmly believes in new technologies, and in the ecosystem that this industry brings. In fact, we remember that Lugano was the first city in the world to equip itself with its own cryptocurrency for payments, its own wallet, its own confederated and institutional blockchain, several incubators for startups and various training courses dedicated to companies, individuals and to the world of business”.

LayerZero Sybil Bounty Reopened On May 28 With Deposit Requirement For Report - Coincu



	

Key Points:




LayerZero Labs introduces deposit requirements for LayerZero Sybil Bounty submissions.



The process will prioritize GitHub reports and bound addresses.



LayerZero aims to fight Sybil activity with over 3,000 bounty reports received following the latest airdrop phase.




LayerZero Labs, the entity behind LayerZero, a blockchain interoperability protocol, has announced plans to reopen submissions for the LayerZero Sybil Bounty, introducing a deposit requirement. The mechanism aims to ensure the integrity of submissions and deter fraud activity.





LayerZero Labs Implements Deposit Requirement for LayerZero Sybil Bounty Submissions



Effective immediately, all LayerZero Sybil Bounty hunters must deposit 0.5 ETH from their reward address to a specified account to be considered eligible for submitting reports. The deposit will be refunded after the Token Generation Event (TGE) if the report is considered honest and successful. However, failure to adhere to submission guidelines, including any form of fraud or plagiarism, will result in forfeiture of the deposit.



The deposit process opens on May 25th at 2:00 UTC, with submission reopening on May 28th at 00:00 UTC for a 48-hour window on Commonwealth. Submissions close on May 30th at 00:00 UTC. 



LayerZero’s Battle Against Sybil Activity



Priority will be given to LayerZero Sybil Bounty reports submitted on GitHub and bound addresses, with new reports evaluated on a “first-come, first-serve basis.” Successful reporters stand to receive a 10% bonus at TGE.




LayerZero Labs is taking proactive steps to combat Sybil activity, a practice where users manipulate multiple wallets to exploit airdrop rewards unfairly. Following the latest phase of LayerZero’s airdrop, which targets Sybils who failed to self-report, CEO Bryan Pellegrino revealed the receipt of over 3,000 bounty reports and 30,000 appeals. Additionally, some users resorted to reporting accusers’ accounts on GitHub to eliminate competition.

Marathon Digital Exploring Opportunities With Kenya Minis...


                                Marathon Digital Tie-Up with Kenya’s Ministry of Energy and Petroleum                                Marathon Digital is a Bitcoin mining company that has recently entered into a partnership with Kenya’s Ministry of Energy and Petroleum (MOEP). This collaboration is expected to profoundly transform the Kenyan renewable energy industry with Marathon Digital’s assistance for the development of energy solutions and strategies.What's the News?Marathon Digital has struck a deal with the Ministry of Energy and Petroleum of Kenya to enhance the nation’s renewable power endeavors. The cooperation will be based on sharing technical expertise, policies, investments, and building of the necessary energy assets. This is considered the major strategic move for Marathon Digital as it opens up a clear roadmap of how the company can expand and invest in opportunities in Kenya. Fred Thiel, the Marathon Digital CEO mentioned that this partnership indicates the innovative approach taken in Kenya to improve the utilization of energy and the enhancement of technological systems.Kenya’s Renewable Energy PracticesCurrently, Kenya is among the leading countries in the utilization of renewable energy sources, as more than 80% of electricity is produced using renewables, as noted by the ITA. The renewable energy sources in the country include wind, solar, hydropower, and geothermal, and out of all these the largest source is geothermal. Kenya has been identified as one of the cheapest producers of geothermal power in the world, and it is endowed with excellent solar resources.Why Kenya Banned WorldcoinAlthough Kenya is among the African countries with progressive policies on renewable energy, the government has not yet been very receptive to digital currencies and blockchain solutions. In September 2023, the Kenyan authorities decided to ban the activities of Worldcoin for one year. Worldcoin is a cryptocurrency project that aims to create a digital asset company that desires to ensure fairness without any fraud. This ban on Worldcoin by Kenya’s Ministry stemmed from the opinions of different governmental bodies and authorities due to privacy, transparency, and security issues connected with the collection of biometric data by Worldcoin. The government insisted that Worldcoin had to seek authorization from the Capital Markets Authority of Kenya and conduct a DPIA and a state-led data security workshop before it could resume operations in the country.ConclusionWhat CoinGabbar has piled up with this finding is that the Marathon Digital has signed a deal with Kenya’s Ministry of Energy and Petroleum, marking a new chapter in the relationship between renewable energy and digital technology. Although Kenya is one of the leading countries in the generation of renewable energy, this new partnership demonstrates Kenya’s interest in innovative methods in energy management as well as in technology. Nevertheless, the critical attitude towards digital assets, such as the temporary ban on Worldcoin proves that the government prioritizes the citizens’ privacy and security. This ensures that Kenya encourages new technologies but citizens’ data and privacy are protected.Also Read: Elon Musk Revealing Dangers Of Politically Correct AI

Spot Bitcoin ETF Inflows Equal March Record as BTC Price Heads for $69K


																Spot Bitcoin ETFs had some hard times at the end of April and especially on May 1, but the trend has changed now with 10 consecutive days of positive flows.
This comes as BTC’s price went on a rollercoaster propelled by the news surrounding the Ethereum ETFs, but the asset now heads toward $69,000.
The cryptocurrency industry saw a massive milestone in January when the US Securities and Exchange Commission finally greenlighted nearly a dozen spot Bitcoin ETFs after a decade of rejecting or delaying every application.
The effects were immediate as these products started attracting billions of dollars in the first few months. Then came April, though, when the trend changed, and there were numerous days in the red.
May 1 was the most painful in terms of outflows, as the total amount withdrawn on that date was north of $560 million.
The tides turned once again in the following weeks, especially after the favorable data from the US CPI numbers for April. In fact, May 10 was the last date when the largest ETFs saw negative numbers.
The financial products have been on an impressive streak since then, equalling the 10 consecutive day record from March of inflows. May 15 and 21 saw inflows of more than $300 million, while May 24’s numbers exceeded $250 million.
BlackRock’s IBIT leads the pack once again in terms of inflows and has attracted over $16,350 billion. Grayscale is still the leader with $20 billion, according to SoSovalue, but the outflows there suggest that BlackRock will surpass it in the near future.
Overall, the total inflows in all ETFs are close to $13.7 billion. Meanwhile, Ethereum fans also saw some positive developments this week as the US SEC greenlighted eight spot ETH ETFs. However, it’s still uncertain when they will launch.
BTC responded with lots of volatility to the Ethereum news, skyrocketing from $67,000 to $72,000 before dumping to under $66,000 this week. The past 24 hours have been more positive, perhaps driven by the impressive inflows, and BTC now stands close to $69,000.

Bitcoin Purchased By ETFs Surpass 12,000 Mark This Week With Optimism - Coincu



	

Key Points:




Spot market Bitcoin ETFs attracted over $1.68 billion in inflows over ten days, with $252 million on May 24 alone.



Currently, the total amount of Bitcoin purchased by ETFs constitutes 4.36% of the total Bitcoin supply.



The SEC’s approval of ETFs coincides with a surge in speculation and the establishment of new venture capital and hedge funds.




New HODL15Capital data has revealed a significant surge in spot market Bitcoin (BTC) exchange-traded funds (ETFs), reporting ten consecutive days of inflows totaling over $1.68 billion.

Bitcoin Purchased By ETFs Hit Impressive Milestone This Week



On May 24 alone, the total net inflow reached $252 million, marking a consistent upward trend over the past week. Notable contributors to this influx include BlackRock’s IBIT ETF, with an inflow of $182 million, and Fidelity’s FBTC ETF, with $43.7083 million. Combined, Bitcoin purchased by ETFs on May 24, reaching 3,654, and over 12,000 throughout the week.



These ETFs offer investors exposure to Bitcoin, allowing them to tap into the crypto asset’s market potential without directly purchasing it. Currently, Bitcoin purchased by ETFs constitutes 4.36% of the total Bitcoin supply, valued at $59.07 billion, as shown by SoSo Value.




SEC Approves Ethereum ETFs Amid Growing Investor Interest



Moreover, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has recently approved spot Ethereum ETFs, signaling a widening acceptance of cryptocurrency investment vehicles. Following the success of Bitcoin ETFs, the market has witnessed a surge in speculation, with new funds emerging at an accelerated pace.



The cryptocurrency investment landscape witnessed a significant surge in activity, with 25 new venture capital and hedge funds established, according to Crypto Fund Research. This marks the highest number of fund launches since the second quarter of 2021, highlighting a growing interest in digital assets among investors.



Comparatively, the number of newly established funds has doubled from those closed during the same period, indicating a bullish sentiment prevailing in the market. Moreover, the figure represents nearly three times the number of funds introduced in the first quarter of 2023.

Santiment Announced: This Altcoin Diverged Positively from Others - "For Every Transaction at a Loss, There Are 11 Transactions in Profit" - Bitcoin Sistemi


Cryptocurrency analysis company Santiment, in its latest analysis, found that one altcoin differs quite positively compared to others.
According to the analysis company's report, Chainlink (LINK) showed a much higher performance than the rise of other cryptocurrencies and exceeded the $ 17.50 level for the first time in 6 weeks.


According to analysts, onchain data showed that for every 1 LINK transaction made at a loss, 11 LINK transactions made at a profit were detected. Santiment reported that this rate is the highest rate since December 8, 2022.
LINK, the world's 14th largest cryptocurrency, has been well-received by the approval of Ethereum Spot ETFs by the SEC. The price of the altcoin increased by nearly 8% in the last week. At the time of writing this article, the price of the altcoin is trading at $17.36.






However, LINK price is still far from its all-time high price level. During the big bull of 2021, the LINK price briefly climbed to $52.88. This shows that the current price is 67% lower than the all-time high price level.
In terms of market value, LINK is approximately 50% lower than the ATH level in 2021.

Cat-Themed v. Dog-Themed Meme Coins: ChatGPT Analyzes Which Will Perform Better in 2024


																TL;DR

Dog-themed meme coins like Dogecoin (DOGE) and Shiba Inu (SHIB) dominate due to strong communities and endorsements, while cat-themed ones like Popcat (POPCAT) are gaining interest but remain less popular.
Pepe (PEPE) has recently surged and could also become a top meme coin this year with continued community support and strategic developments, though investors should be cautious due to market volatility.


What Are the Expectations?
The meme coin realm has made great strides in the past several months, with its total market capitalization surpassing the $60 billion mark. Dog-themed sector leaders such as Dogecoin (DOGE), Shiba Inu (SHIB), dogwifhat (WIF), Bonk Inu (BONK), Floki Inu (FLOKI), and many others have charted substantial price increases, capturing the attention of industry participants.
However, recently emerged cat-themed meme coins, including Popcat (POPCAT), Cat in a Dogs World (MEW), and Mog Coin (MOG), have also made the headlines thanks to their rising value and increased investor interest. As such, we decided to ask ChatGPT which niche will perform better in the remaining months of 2024.
The AI-powered chatbot stated that such a prediction is “highly speculative” due to the asset class’s infamous volatility. It also claimed that meme coins thrive on community enthusiasm and social media trends, suggesting that the popularity of cat-themed versus dog-themed coins can shift rapidly based on viral trends and influencer endorsements.
Other essential factors that can tip the scales are technological developments, regulatory environment, strategic partnerships, and marketing efforts.




ChatGPT noted that dog-themed meme coins, such as DOGE and SHIB, currently have the edge due to their well-established communities, substantial market caps, and support from popular figures. A recent study estimated that Shiba Inu has the strongest community base in the cohort, followed by Dogecoin. 
For its part, DOGE is the favorite cryptocurrency of Tesla’s CEO – Elon Musk. The billionaire often praises its merits, while the EV giant officially integrated it as a payment option on its website recently.
Cat-themed memes are less popular, but according to ChatGPT, they can benefit from specific marketing moves:
“A viral trend or major endorsement could propel a cat-themed coin to prominence, especially if it taps into a currently underserved niche. Strong marketing campaigns and community engagement could help a cat-themed coin gain ground on its dog-themed counterparts.”
Currently, the gap in terms of market capitalization between the top cat-themed meme coin POPCAT and the leading dog-themed DOGE is over $22 billion. However, the ever-evolving meme coin sector is capable of offering surprises, so it will be interesting to follow what will happen in the following months.

How About Another Scenario?
One meme coin that has been crypto’s rock star in the past few days due to reaching a new all-time high price is the frog-themed Pepe (PEPE). As such, we conducted a separate ChatGPT query asking about its chances of emerging as the sector’s leader before the end of 2024.
The chatbot noted PEPE’s recent strong market momentum, claiming that “sustained community support and engagement” are crucial for reaching the top. 
Additionally, ChatGPT estimated that the asset’s price and market capitalization could take off if the team behind the project implements technological advancements or developments that add utility and thus attract more investors. 
“If PEPE continues to capture the interest of the crypto community, it could indeed rise to the top of the meme coin rankings. However, given the speculative nature of meme coins, investors should approach with caution and stay informed about market developments,” the chatbot concluded.

                        Bitcoin whales, large holders of the cryptocurrency, have shown an increased appetite for accumulating more coins, signaling a return of confidence in the bull market, as per blockchain data.The resurgence in whale activity comes after the price of Bitcoin reached its all-time high in March and subsequently experienced a significant market correction.Market intelligence firm CryptoQuant highlighted the strong buying force exhibited by whales, indicating their belief that current prices are favorable for purchasing and accumulating Bitcoin, despite prevailing fear and market uncertainty.Analysts pointed to the rise in the 30-day percentage change in whale address holdings, along with an increase in the total BTC balance held by whales.Whales Buy Bitcoin Aggressively During Bull Markets
Whales, defined as owners of Bitcoin addresses holding between 1,000 BTC and 10,000 BTC (excluding mining firms and crypto exchanges), tend to buy Bitcoin more aggressively during bull markets and reduce their buying activity during bear markets.Throughout March, whales had increased their BTC holdings by over 9.8%. Although their accumulation rate slowed in April to 4.2% by May 1, coinciding with Bitcoin’s price decline of over 20% to under $57,000, the metric has now rebounded to 5.5% as of May 22.CryptoQuant CEO Ki Young Ju previously noted that whales had acquired 47,000 BTC during the sharp market dip in early May, further indicating their confidence in the asset’s long-term prospects.The amount of money invested by whales in Bitcoin has significantly grown from $57 billion to $122 billion since the beginning of the year, as observed through the “realized cap” metric, which considers the total value of all whale-held coins based on their purchase time rather than the current market value.Bitcoin’s price has recently risen to $68,760, marking a 3% increase over the week and reflecting the renewed optimism in the market.Lead Glassnode analyst James Check emphasized that the Bitcoin network’s total realized cap has reached a record high of $578 billion, underscoring the robust fundamentals of the cryptocurrency.However, Check believes that the market is still far from entering the true euphoria phase of the bull market, suggesting that the current sentiment falls somewhere between enthusiasm and excitement.Institutional Investors Increase Crypto Exposure
Nearly 40% of institutional investors had some exposure to crypto assets in 2023, a notable rise from the 31% recorded in 2021.According to a recent survey, a third of respondents reported having at least 10% of their portfolio allocated to crypto assets, compared to only a fifth of respondents two years ago.As reported, Markus Thielen, the head of research at 10x Research, previously predicted that a breakthrough above $67,500 could potentially lead to new all-time highs. Currently, BTC is trading at $68,700, less than $5,000 away from reaching a new all-time high in U.S. dollars.Aside from 10x Research, some other analysts have also turned bullish on Bitcoin following weeks-long consolidation.Leading trading firm QCP Capital has expressed optimism about Bitcoin’s price momentum, forecasting a potential return to the highs of $74,000.

Warren Buffett Disciple Pabrai Retains His Mentor's Stance On Bitcoin Despite Rally: 'Going To End Badly' - Benzinga

This story was first published on the Benzinga India portal.Amid the volatile waves of the cryptocurrency market, Mohnish Pabrai, an investment fund manager often likened to Warren Buffett, has cast a shadow of doubt over the future of Bitcoin.What Happened: Pabrai, in a recent appearance on the My First Million podcast, shared his critical perspective on Bitcoin, hinting at a bleak future for the digital currency. He admitted that Bitcoin BTC/USD is beyond his expertise and bluntly stated, “If you put a gun to my head, I would say it’s going to end badly.” His skepticism is rooted in the absence of intrinsic value in Bitcoin, which he believes is essential for investment.Drawing a parallel between Bitcoin and the US dollar, “The Dhando Investor” author pointed out that despite the dollar’s lack of intrinsic value, it is underpinned by “the full faith and credit of the US government,” bolstered by the trust of the American people. This kind of support, he argues, is starkly missing for Bitcoin.If you’d like to stay ahead of the curve on the Indian market, sign up for our Ring The Bell newsletter by clicking here.Pabrai also cautioned that most individuals should steer clear of investing in Bitcoin, as many are unable to justify its value or foresee its future trajectory. His views mirror the approach of many value investors who question the cryptocurrency’s foundational support and its prospects for longevity.Why It Matters: Pabrai’s apprehension towards Bitcoin resonates with the sentiments of other prominent figures in the investment world. Charlie Munger and Buffett, two of the most respected investors globally, have also expressed their disdain for Bitcoin, albeit for different reasons. Buffett once famously referred to Bitcoin as “probably rat poison squared,” underscoring his skepticism about its value.Moreover, the call for a crackdown on Bitcoin and the broader crypto industry by the JPMorgan CEO has added to the negative sentiment, although this stance was met with ridicule on social media. Meanwhile, cryptocurrencies are hitting new highs with Bitcoin trading above ₹56.2 lakh and Ethereum at ₹3.16 lakh.The latest surge is coming after the U.S. markets regulator, the SEC, approved eight Ethereum spot ETFs after giving similar approval for Bitcoin offerings months prior.Image Via ShutterstockRead Next: Sundar Pichai Echoes '3 Idiots' In Chat With Varun Mayya: 'Real Success Comes From...'

Investors Pile Into Bitcoin: Spot ETFs On A Tear For 8 Straight Days


								The floodgates have opened for Bitcoin in the US, with spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) experiencing a record-breaking eight days of consecutive net inflows. This surge in investor appetite, totaling more than $150 million on a single day, signifies a new era for cryptocurrency accessibility and traditional market acceptance.

Ethereum Enters The Arena
The positive sentiment surrounding Bitcoin ETFs extends to its Ethereum counterpart. The US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) recently requested amendments and refilings of applications for spot Ether ETFs.
This move, often seen as a precursor to approval, has sent ripples of excitement through the cryptocurrency community. Cboe BZX submitted revised forms for five spot Ether ETFs, while Nasdaq filed the amended form for BlackRock’s offering.
The potential approval of spot Ether ETFs could further fuel the digital asset market. Ethereum, the world’s second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, boasts a vibrant ecosystem of decentralized applications (dApps) and smart contracts. Investor interest in gaining exposure to this rapidly evolving space is undeniable.

Bitcoin: Regulation Paves The Way, BlackRock Leads The Charge
This bullish run coincides with the recent passing of the Financial Innovation and Technology for the 21st Century Act (FIT21) by the U.S. House of Representatives. The act aims to establish a long-awaited legal framework for the digital asset industry, empowering the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) with greater oversight of crypto assets as “digital commodities.”
While the FIT21 Act marks a significant step towards crypto regulation, it’s not without its critics. Concerns surround the lack of robust consumer protection measures in the current version of the bill. However, the act’s passage signifies a willingness from lawmakers to embrace the future of finance, and further refinements are expected to address consumer safety concerns.


BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) has emerged as the frontrunner in this gold rush, attracting a staggering $92 million in inflows. This move by the world’s largest asset manager validates Bitcoin as a legitimate asset class and is likely influencing other institutional investors to follow suit. Fidelity Digital Assets’ Wise Origin Bitcoin ETF is another major player, raking in $75 million, further solidifying the trend.

While Grayscale’s industry-leading Bitcoin Investment Trust (GBTC) witnessed a minor setback with net outflows, the overall sentiment remains overwhelmingly optimistic. Spot Bitcoin ETFs have collectively garnered a staggering $13.33 billion since their launch in January, reflecting a massive vote of confidence from investors.
Additionally, the cumulative trading volume surpasses $267 billion, highlighting a highly liquid market eager to absorb new investments.
A New Era For Digital Assets
The confluence of surging investor interest, regulatory progress, and the potential arrival of spot Ether ETFs paints a bright picture for the future of digital assets in the US.

As traditional finance embraces Bitcoin and potentially Ethereum, a new era of accessibility and legitimacy dawns for the cryptocurrency market. However, regulatory hurdles remain, and ensuring investor protection will be crucial for sustained growth. With careful navigation, the US has the potential to become a global leader in the burgeoning world of digital finance.

Senate Hopeful John Deaton Rebukes Elizabeth Warren's Crypto Policies


							

John Deaton proclaims his fight against the crypto critic Senator Elizabeth Warren.



Deaton calls it a fight against the government overreach, reflecting on his war against the SEC.



The XRP lawyer addresses himself as a pro-freedom rather than a pro-crypto candidate.




John Deaton, an XRP attorney and U.S. Senate candidate, has intensified his battle against crypto-critic Senator Elizabeth Warren. Positioning himself as a “pro-freedom candidate,” the XRP lawyer proclaimed his fight against what he terms “government overreach.”







Deaton is well-known among crypto enthusiasts as an XRP attorney who joined the community to challenge the SEC’s regulatory actions. The SEC’s lawsuit against Ripple, which seeks to classify XRP as a security, remains unresolved and has been a focal point of Deaton’s advocacy.



As an opponent of Warren, who recently reiterated her anti-crypto stance and formed the “anti-crypto army,” Deaton does not consider himself a pro-crypto candidate but rather a pro-freedom candidate. Criticizing Warren’s strong opposition to cryptocurrencies, Deaton asserted it is “anti-American.”



In his recent post on X, he drew parallels between his prolonged conflict with the SEC and his opposition to Warren. He highlighted his disagreement with both the SEC and Senator Warren over their anti-crypto measures and regulatory overreach. He stated, “It’s the most important AND most difficult fight against government overreach.”



Ahead of the 2024 U.S. Presidential Election, President Joe Biden and Republican candidate Donald Trump have clarified their stances on crypto. Trump announced his support for crypto and has even begun accepting crypto donations, while Biden has sworn to combat cryptocurrencies, forming an anti-crypto coalition.









Referring to the political divide between Republicans and Democrats on crypto, Deaton emphasized Warren’s significant role in exacerbating this divide. He remarked, “It’s fueled by my opponent, Elizabeth Warren, who just fuels the division.”



Recently, when Warren demanded stricter crypto regulations, including oversight of crypto and stablecoin users, Deaton criticized her, accusing her of “misleading the American people.” Deaton advocated a balanced approach to crypto regulation that fosters innovation while addressing risks.

Uniswap price jumps 20% as UNI hints at massive breakout - CoinJournal



                    

                    
Uniswap price reached highs of $10.99 on May 25, rising more than 20% in 24 hours.
UNI gained amid whale activity, Ethereum ecosystem developments and Uniswap Labs’ response to SEC’s Wells Notice.
The technical picture also hints at a breakout that could push UNI price to $15.40 and towards $2.

Uniswap price jumped more than 20% in 24 hours to trade at $10.99, its highest level since early April.
A bullish outlook suggests increased buying pressure could push UNI towards highs of $15.40 reached in March.
Uniswap price and the ETH ecosystem
UNI is the native token of the leading DEX platform, likely one of the top beta plays around the spot Ethereum ETF approval.
On Friday, Uniswap price defied marketwide consolidation, with the price of Ethereum (ETH) hovering above $3,700. As most altcoins looked to bounce off key support levels, UNI price rose more than 20% to touch a multi-week peak of $10.95.
This comes as whales increasingly withdraw UNI from exchanges. According to on-chain details shared by Lookonchain on X, one such whale withdrew $1.96 million in UNI from Binance as price rose.
Uniswap’s upside momentum has also strengthened amid the unveiling of ERC-7683. This new token standard is a collaboration between Uniswap Labs and Across Protocol and aims at streamlining cross-chain trading via a “unified framework for cross-chain intents systems.”
UNI surges after Uniswap response to SEC
Breaching the critical $10 mark also came amid a rising bullish sentiment around Uniswap’s regulatory outlook.
Earlier this week, Uniswap Labs’ reiterated its readiness to fight the SEC’s potential lawsuit following a recent Wells Notice.
According to Uniswap, the SEC is “wrong” in its assertions that the DEX platform is an unregistered securities exchange and broker-dealer. The allegation that UNI is a security is also wrong, with SEC’s theories around it “weak” Uniswap wrote in a response to the regulator.
Uniswap price chart
Uniswap’s surge in the past 24 hours sees UNI breakout of a consolidation phase that had prices capped below the $8 level.
Increased whale activity and the current projections for the ETH ecosystem favour UNI bulls.

The technical picture also supports an upside continuation. In this case, the RSI and MACD indicators on the daily chart suggest bulls are in control.
If this outlook holds, UNI price could eye the key resistance levels at $12.96 and $15.40. An important short term target lies at $2

This Week in Coins: Ethereum ETFs Get the Green Light, Dogecoin Jumps on Elon Musk Tweet - Decrypt

We do the research, you get the alpha!Get exclusive reports and access to key insights on airdrops, NFTs, and more! Subscribe now to Alpha Reports and up your game!Go to Alpha ReportsIt’s been a wild week for crypto, with what many see as a complete 180-degree turn from the Securities and Exchange Commission when the regulator on Thursday approved eight spot Ethereum ETFs. The SEC said yes to the likes of Grayscale, VanEck, Fidelity, and BlackRock after industry observers said for months that the products would not get approved.Despite the funds now making their way to the market, the price of the coin didn't move much on the news. It still had a great week since rumors of incoming approvals dropped on Monday: ETH is now trading for $3,747, a more than 20% seven-day jump.The ETFs won't be available until applicants sort their S-1 forms out with the SEC. But the approval is a big win for the space. Soon, traditional investors will be able to buy shares that track the price of the second-biggest digital asset—and if the eventual launch of the products is anything like the Bitcoin ETF one, capital will flood the space.Bitcoin rode off the back of the ETH approval rumors on Monday and passed the $70,000 mark for the first time in more than a month.The price of the biggest digital asset has since dipped and is now at $68,757 per coin, per data from CoinGecko, a 2.8% increase over the week.Other coins and tokens have risen over the past week, with Chainlink, Avalanche, and Bitcoin Cash making gains of 4.8%, 3.1%, and 3% respectively.But Dogecoin is the best-performer out of the top assets, having jumped by 7% in one week.It's now priced at $0.1656 after Tesla CEO Elon Musk posted a picture on Twitter expressing his condolences for Kabosu, the Shiba Inu behind the Doge meme, who died Friday.Dogecoin, the original meme coin, was created as a joke by developers wanting to poke fun at the seriousness of Bitcoin. But it gained near-mainstream traction in 2021 when Elon Musk—currently the third richest person on the planet—started pumping the coin on Twitter, the platform he now owns.Its market cap has since grown and it's the ninth biggest cryptocurrency as a result.Edited by Ryan Ozawa.

Farewell, Doge: Kabosu, the Shiba Inu Behind the Iconic Meme, Dies at 18


																Kabosu, the Shiba Inu who became a global internet sensation as the face of the “Doge” meme, passed away on May 24 at the age of 18, her owner, Japanese kindergarten teacher Atsuko Sato, confirmed on Instagram.
The beloved dog, known for her iconic expression and the humorous captions that accompanied her photos, captured the hearts of millions worldwide and became a symbol of the whimsical and endearing nature of internet culture. “Kabosu is at rest now,” Sato wrote in a heartfelt blog post.
Confirming the news, Dogecoin’s official X handle tweeted,
“Today Kabosu, our community’s shared friend and inspiration, peacefully passed in the arms of her person. The impact this one dog has made across the world is immeasurable. She was a being who knew only happiness and limitless love.
Please keep her spirit and her family in your heart, and most importantly carry her with you as your story continues – we are all fortunate for hers to have touched and shaped ours.”
In 2008, Sato adopted Kabosu, naming her after the citrus fruit “kabosu” because she thought the dog had a round face resembling the fruit.
The viral meme of Kabosu led to the creation of Dogecoin (DOGE) in 2013, which began as a joke currency and is currently the world’s largest meme coin by market cap.




DOGE’s success opened the floodgates for the creation of numerous other dog-themed tokens, including Shiba Inu Coin (SHIB) and Floki (FLOKI), which have since gained tremendous traction in the cryptocurrency industry.
In late December 2022, Kabosu was reported to be seriously ill with leukemia, though Sato later mentioned that her health had improved soon after the diagnosis.

Uniswap Shoots Past $10 On 17% Price Explosion - Here's The Trigger


																In a week marked by consolidation across the cryptocurrency market, the native token of Uniswap, UNI, has defied the trend, surging over 15%, and surpassing the $10 mark. This bullish run comes amid positive developments within the Ethereum ecosystem and Uniswap’s ongoing legal battle with the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).

	Related Reading


Riding The Ethereum Wave
Beyond the legal battle, the current momentum within the Ethereum ecosystem is also propelling UNI’s price upwards. On-chain data reveals significant whale withdrawals from crypto exchanges following news of a potential spot Ethereum ETF.

This flight to safety, coupled with the overall bullish sentiment surrounding Ethereum, is creating a ripple effect that benefits UNI, a key player within the Ethereum DeFi landscape.
From a technical standpoint, UNI’s breakout from a monthly consolidation phase paints a promising picture. Both technical indicators and on-chain data suggest a potential 25% price increase for UNI.
Source: Lookonchain
The token’s recent surge indicates a potential bull run, with analysts eyeing a price target of $12.80 if the current momentum continues.
Adding fuel to the fire is Santiment’s Age Consumed index, which measures the movement of dormant tokens. Spikes in this index often precede price rallies, and the latest uptick by the latter part of April seems to have foreshadowed UNI’s current uptrend.
This on-chain metric reinforces the bullish outlook for UNI, suggesting that investors are awakening to its potential.
Short Sellers Get Burned As Bulls Take Charge
The recent price rally has also been accompanied by a significant rise in trading activity. Data from Coinalyze reveals over $1 million in Uniswap liquidations in the last day.
The majority of these liquidations (over $750,000) were short positions, indicating that traders betting against UNI are feeling the heat. This surge in open interest, with more traders going long on UNI, further strengthens the bullish control over the token’s price.
UNI is currently trading at $10,8. Chart: TradingView
Uniswap Takes A Stand Against The SEC
This display of defiance has instilled confidence among investors, who view it as a positive sign for Uniswap’s future. The popular decentralized exchange (DEX) recently received a Wells notice from the regulatory body, alleging that UNI is a security. However, Uniswap has vowed to challenge this claim, asserting that the SEC’s case is weak.

The SEC case against Uniswap remains unresolved, and a negative outcome could dampen investor sentiment. A broader market correction could still impact UNI’s price.

Wizard Pepe (WIZPEPE) to Skyrocket 18,000% as KuCoin Listing Announced, While Shiba Inu and Dogecoin Struggle



                    

Wizard Pepe (WIZPEPE) could turn early investors into multi-millionaires if it becomes a mainstream coin, like Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE).



Wizard Pepe (WIZPEPE), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is poised to explode over 18,000% in price in the coming days.




This is because WIZPEPE has announced its first centralized exchange listing, which will be on KuCoin.



This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up.



Currently, Wizard Pepe can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jupiter and Raydium, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days.




Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Wizard Pepe could become the next viral memecoin.



Wizard Pepe launched with over $6,000 of locked liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains.



To buy Wizard Pepe on Raydium or Jupiter ahead of the KuCoin listing, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Wizard Pepe by entering its contract address – AJM9tnhfGz9xezv1rTjspoTug3YVpcmrp3gJ9FMDEEYj – in the receiving field.



In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price.




If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner.



The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum.



This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like WIZPEPE.

What is a Bitcoin Futures ETF? How Does it Work? List of 16 Top Bitcoin Futures ETF

Bitcoin Futures ETF allows investors to invest their money in leveraged Bitcoin instruments such as Futures and Options. Leverage provides them with a way to reap greater returns than the average investors. 
However, there are ample risks involved too. Risks such as capital risk, and regulatory risk pose a great challenge. Yet, with diligence, these ETFs prove a great investment.
This article explores Bitcoin Futures ETF and tries to explain their working, benefits and disadvantages. At the end, there is a list of 16 top Bitcoin Futures ETFs with a brief explanation on how they make money for their investors.
What are Bitcoin Futures?
Bitcoin Futures refers to the derivative contracts which trade with a certain amount of leverage. These contracts do not trade actual bitcoin but place a kind of bet on the future price of Bitcoin (hence the name). The bets are usually directional (bullish or bearish) and provide multifold return to the investor who has accurately predicted the price movement.
Usually a derivative contract is between two parties, one among whom assumes that the price will go higher and the other assumes the price would go lower. These parties remain anonymous to each other and meet via a crypto derivative exchange such as Binance, Coinbase or Derebit.
Futures trading has been beneficial for both institutional as well as retain traders. Institutions can take market positions (bearish or bullish) against a certain event (say elections) and protect their holdings from volatility. Whereas for retail users, it is a quick way to make a lot of money, although with a huge risk.
How Bitcoin Futures and Future ETFs Work?
Let us understand how future trading works with an example.
Suppose Bitcoin is at $60,000 and you run a Bitcoin ETF with 100k Bitcoins. Now imagine, if there is any negative news, for example, if the US Fed raises interest rates by 1%, it would definitely result in a market crash. But you won’t be able to sell all your 100k Bitcoins before the crash takes place, simply because of the fund size.
For the sake of simplicity, let us assume that Bitcoin would rise or fall just $1,000 in any case.
If you would have sold your Bitcoins at $60k, there is no surety that it would have fetched you the same price i.e.$60k, because selling such a large holding takes time. Plus, if you try to sell such a huge number of Bitcoins, it could have resulted in a market crash. Also, you would have been banned from trading in any crypto exchange.
Now here comes a person, who says that if Bitcoin falls from $60k to $59k, I will give you $1000 cash and if the reverse happens, say a rally from $60k to $61k, you will have to pay me $1000.
Now, think, why would someone enter into such an agreement with you. The reason is with Bitcoin futures, the person would have to pay a very small price($10 with a leverage of 100) as investment(margin) and gain $1000 if they are right. This contract is called a leveraged futures contract.
NOTE: Leverage is a form of trader where a person invests a small amount (margin), say $10 and is allowed to trade at a much bigger nominal value, say $100. The trader is liquidated (stopped) if their losses go above $10. This is how leverage works in its simplest form.
For more details on how leverage works, see the relevant section below.
If the institution/Bitcoin ETF fails (i.e., the market goes higher), they just lose $1000 and but their entire fund is still protected and also as price goes up by $1000, they make more gains. If they are right (market goes down) they still get $1000 from the individual trader.
On the trader’s side, they gain $1000 if the market goes up but lose $10 if the market goes down.
Why Are Bitcoin Future ETFs Popular?
Bitcoin ETFs provide a safe yet rewarding way for retailers to earn from Bitcoin derivatives.
Futures trading is greatly rewarding for individual retail traders, however, there is a catch. Retail traders often lack the sophisticated knowledge of trading strategies. For retail individual traders, this results in a loss most of the time they trade.
However, there is a better way for them to benefit. Traders and investors who want to benefit from Futures trading, but do not want to do it on their own, can take the benefit of Bitcoin Futures ETF.
Bitcoin Futures ETF are the shares of the companies that trade Bitcoin Futures with expert knowledge and years of experience. These traders have quantitative models, risk-reward ratio calculations and several times even insider knowledge that helps them secure a profit most of the times they trade. Even their losses are capped with the diligent usage of risk management strategies.



These ETFs charge a small amount of money to manage customer funds, often in the range of 0.1% to 2%.
There are several Bitcoin Futures all over the world and they have been present since October 2021.

Bitcoin
Bitcoin is a cryptocurrency and the first one to solve the double spending problem. Previously, all other cryptocurrencies could be just copied and pasted several times to create multiple yet identical copies. Bitcoin used a unique method called proof of work to make sure that a certain user could only spend their crypto once.

Futures and Options, together called derivatives, allows users to place intelligent bets on the future price of a certain asset, here Bitcoin. A future trade is composed of two traders who have different and opposing views on the price of Bitcoin at a future date, say 1 month ahead.
ETF
An Exchange Traded Fund or ETF is a share of a trust fund that trades solely in Bitcoin Futures. Whatever proceeds are obtained as a result, are shared between the subscribers of the ETF based on their percentage of ownership.
Margin
Margin is the minimum amount you have to put forward in order to trade a Future contract. For example, if you are trading a 10x Futures contract with a nominal value of $100, you would need a margin of $10.



Derivative
Futures and Options are collectively called as derivatives because they derive their value from a separate independent financial asset such as stocks, crypto or commodities. For this article, a financial asset refers to Bitcoin, Ethereum or any other cryptocurrency.
Leverage
Leverage is the ratio of the nominal amount of your trade and the margin you put forward. In the above example of Margin, the leverage is 10x since it allows you to trade a contract that has a nominal value of 100 with a margin of $10.
Liquidation/Liquidated
Liquidation, in the scope of this article, is the act of terminating a futures contract because its losses have either exceeded the amount of margin put forward or simply because the exchange cannot settle this trade beyond a certain level. This acts as a safety mechanism and prevents a sell-off or shoot-off in a crypto’s price.

Cardano's price loss - Is it time to scoop more ADA? - AMBCrypto



Most ADA transactions ended in a loss, prompting speculation that the price might drop again
Price-DAA was below 0.50, indicating that it could be time to buy the token

Losing 5.42% of its value in the last 7 days is something that has allowed Cardano [ADA] to emerge as one of the market’s worst performers the top 20. Now, while the token might not be new to this tag, some market participants believe that it could be a good time to buy the token.
To lend further insight into this, AMBCrypto considered an in-depth on-chain analysis. At press time, ADA’s price was $0.45. Its latest bout of depreciation has affected its transactions in profit and loss on the Cardano network.
Cardano stops giving and keeps taking
According to Santiment, the ratio of daily on-chain transactions volume in profit to loss was 0.827 at press time. If this ratio is over 1, it means that there are more participants realizing gains than losses.
In this case, ADA’s trend would have been bullish. However, the reading above indicated that only 0.827 transactions ended in profits, when compared to every on-chain transaction that realized a loss.
Historically, this metric seems to correlate with the price. For instance, the ratio hit 0.722 in February. At the time, ADA’s price was $0.57. A few weeks later, the price jumped to $0.73 on the charts.
Source: Santiment
A similar scenario transpired on 13 April. At that time, the decline in the ratio triggered ADA’s bounce from $0.43 to $0.52. Considering its past performances, there is a chance Cardano might drop further.
If this is the case, the value of the cryptocurrency might drop to $0.42. However, there is a high chance that ADA might produce a 20% hike too, meaning a rise to $0.50 within a few days.
An entry level has appeared
Additionally, the price-DAA divergence is an indicator that can predict ADA’s valuation. DAA is an acronym for Daily Active Addresses, used to measure the overall level of network activity.
When combined with the price, the metric can identify potential exit and entry points. At press time, the price-DAA was -38.88%. From a trading perspective, a buy signal appears when the metric is less than 0.50.
On the other hand, a sell signal appears when the divergence is at 0.90 or above. Since the ratio was 0.388, it seemed to be a sign that it could be time to start Dollar Cost Averaging (DCA) Cardano’s native token before the price pumps.
Source: Santiment
However, it is important to note that this metric alone cannot dictate where Cardano might be heading.
Assessing the same using the volume, on-chain data revealed that the metric hiked on the charts. This is an indication of more buying and selling. However, a look at the price action would suggest that there have been more sales than accumulation.

As long as this remains the case, ADA might face another decline as mentioned above. However, if the decline gets too intense, the token could rally back to its yearly peak.

China's Crypto Crackdown Failing? Billions in Illegal Transactions Exposed


							

Chinese authorities uncover billions in illicit crypto despite a nationwide ban.



Underground banks and illegal exchanges flourish as China’s crypto crackdown falters.



About $86 billion of crypto flowed into China in the 12 months through June 2023.




Recent developments in China suggest the continued use of cryptocurrencies despite an existing ban by the government. Multiple raids by the Chinese police uncovered the use of cryptocurrencies for illicit transactions totaling billions of dollars.



A Bloomberg report revealed that in May, the police in China discovered an underground bank linked to 13.8 billion yuan, or $1.9 billion worth, of illegal transfers. They uncovered a gang implicated in the unauthorized conversion of about 2 billion yuan, and multiple unlawful money exchanges involving transactions worth over 1 billion yuan.



The outcome of these discoveries suggests a significant presence of Chinese traders actively participating in the cryptocurrency market. Furthermore, the police located the suspects around Beijing, the northeastern province of Jilin, and Chengdu City in the southwest, raising the possibility of a widespread practice across the entire country.



It is worth noting that it has been two years since the Chinese authorities imposed a ban on cryptocurrency transactions within the country’s borders. The government cited money laundering, currency outflows, and environmental harm from energy-intensive Bitcoin mining as the reasons behind its crypto ban.









However, there is a belief that Chinese citizens are still involved with digital assets. While many use it as an alternative investment amid falling property prices, others utilize crypto as a channel for circumventing overseas transfer limits.



In a statement, Chengyi Ong, APAC policy head at Chainalysis Inc., noted that a significant amount of crypto activity remains in China. According to Ong, this may be a result of the lack of strict enforcement of the ban. Nevertheless, he acknowledged that the decentralized and peer-to-peer nature of crypto activities could be contributing factors.



As reported by Chainalysis, about $86 billion of crypto flowed into China in the 12 months through June 2023. The blockchain firm acknowledged the volume to be substantial, despite being significantly down from pre-ban levels.

This Ethereum Rival Could Skyrocket by Nearly 2x Over the Short to Medium-Term, Says Coin Bureau’s Guy Turner - The Daily Hodl


								The host of the Coin Bureau YouTube channel, Guy Turner, is expressing bullish sentiment on one Ethereum (ETH) competitor.
Turner tells the 2.47 million subscribers of the Coin Bureau channel that the layer-1 blockchain Fantom (FTM) possesses more upside potential based on technical analysis.










“The weekly chart appears to be painting a wonky head and shoulders pattern that looks eerily similar to the topping pattern FTM saw in late 2021. Notably, this pattern implies that there could be one more leg higher.”
Source: Coin Bureau/YouTube
According to Turner, Fantom could go up by approximately 98%, nearing double its current price.
“Zooming out on the weekly chart suggests that FTM could rally as high as $1.60 in the short to medium term where it will likely stall out due to resistance, also known as bag holders, from the previous bull market. After that, it’s anyone’s guess.”
Fantom is trading at $0.810 at time of writing.
On the reasons supporting his bullish thesis for Fantom, the Coin Bureau host says,
“FTM has some solid ‘pump-a-mentals,’ so to speak. It has a low price tag and a market cap that isn’t so large as to prohibit an epic pump. 
The fact that FTM’s supply has already vested to investors and the team suggests there will be minimal sell pressure from their side, particularly when you factor in the Fantom Foundation’s apparently enormous runway… 
The only thing that FTM is missing is a narrative that retail investors can understand. And more retail accessibility. Specifically, FTM is not currently listed on Coinbase though it’s possible this could change if regulations in the US change.”

US and Hong Kong Spot Crypto ETFs Diverge Post-SEC Approval


The recent development of spot Ethereum (ETH) exchange-traded funds (ETFs) by the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has significantly influenced the crypto investment environment.
Following the SEC’s preliminary approval for spot Ethereum ETFs, Bitcoin (BTC) counterparts continue to record positive inflows.
US Spot Crypto ETFs Surge Amid Renewed Optimism

SoSo Value data reveals that as of May 24, US spot Bitcoin ETFs had a total net inflow of $251.94 million. This marks ten consecutive days of inflows. On the same day, BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) and Fidelity Wise Origin Bitcoin Fund (FBTC) received inflows of $182 million and $44 million, respectively.
Meanwhile, Grayscale Bitcoin Trust ETF (GBTC) received no flows on the same day. This is noteworthy considering the negative flow streak for US spot Bitcoin ETFs from late April until early May.

Indeed, the spot Ethereum ETFs have infused the crypto market with renewed optimism. BeInCrypto reported that Ethereum and some tokens in its ecosystem have shown impressive performance since Monday.
However, it is important to note that the spot Ethereum ETFs have yet to be officially launched, and SEC approval for the S-1 filings is awaiting. James Seyffart, an ETF analyst at Bloomberg Intelligence, expects that the spot Ethereum ETFs will ” take a couple of weeks but could take longer” to trade in the market.

“Typically, this process takes months. Like up to 5 months in some examples, but Eric Balchunas and I think this will be at least somewhat accelerated. Bitcoin ETFs were at least 90 days. Will know more soon,” he explained.


Nonetheless, experts remain optimistic. Another ETF analyst, Eric Balchunas, predicts that spot Ethereum ETFs could acquire “10% to 15% of the assets of the spot Bitcoin ETFs.”
Despite renewed interest in the US market, spot crypto ETFs in Hong Kong saw a relatively muted performance. Data shows that from May 20 to May 23, Hong Kong’s spot Bitcoin ETFs recorded no flows for two consecutive days. Meanwhile, their Ethereum counterparts only recorded an inflow of 62.80 ETH on May 22.

However, a recent report mentioned that Hong Kong’s regulator is considering including staking for spot Ethereum ETFs. This is particularly interesting since potential issuers in the US have removed staking from their filings. By including staking rewards, Hong Kong’s spot Ethereum ETFs could provide a competitive edge, offering extra yield for investors.

Will Bitcoin Rise and Outshine Nvidia's AI Boom? Experts Weigh In


							

Nvidia stock soars, but doubtful of outpace Bitcoin for the next decade.



Crypto experts predict Bitcoin’s resurgence due to rising institutional interest.



Spot Bitcoin ETF approvals have set the stage for a Bitcoin bull run.




Cryptocurrency experts contend that despite NVIDIA stocks’ outperforming the Bitcoin the past decade, the feat is highly unlikely to repeat itself over the next decade. Swan CEO Cory Klippsten highlighted this in a recent X post, responding to data shared by Lyn Alden, founder of Lyn Alden Investment Strategy.







Alden’s post illustrated that while Bitcoin’s market capitalization grew by 19,920% over the past decade, NVIDIA’s stock gained an impressive 24,840%, exceeding Bitcoin’s performance by roughly 5,000%.



TradingView’s data revealed that NVIDIA’s stock traded for less than $4 in 2014 and experienced gradual growth until 2020 before a breakout to the upside. This breakout coincided with a boom in the AI sector, leading to numerous innovations and the development of AI-related solutions.



Notably, after the 2020-’21 rally, NVIDIA’s stock price slumped in the 2022 bear market, only to rebound in Q4 of the same year. Since then, the chipmaker’s stock has surged by an impressive 905.58%. Its most notable performance occurred this month, following the release of sales and earnings figures that surpassed expectations.



Despite NVIDIA’s impressive run, analysts believe Bitcoin will surpass it in the coming years, with the flagship cryptocurrency entering a new phase that could witness an influx of institutional investors. The January approval of a spot Bitcoin ETF by the SEC bolstered Bitcoin’s prospects for mainstream adoption and opened a new frontier for Bitcoin.









As anticipated, Bitcoin responded to this development by surging to a new all-time high. However, many users believe Bitcoin’s rally is only beginning and expect the fund’s influx to continue in the coming years. Analysts predict that Bitcoin’s price could reach $200,000 within the next two years, with the potential to climb even higher over the long term.



The contrasting trajectories of NVIDIA and Bitcoin highlight the intricate landscape of investment. While NVIDIA’s recent success is undeniable, Bitcoin’s potential to outpace it in the coming years, fueled by growing institutional interest and favorable regulatory shifts, underscores the allure of this evolving asset class. As both technologies continue to reshape their respective domains, investors are awaiting the next big-ticket for the next decade.

The History of Binance: A Multi Billion Dollar Crypto Empire

Despite all the legal and illegal blows that it got, no one can deny that Binance is still the largest crypto exchange in the world. Everyday millions of customers transfer billions of dollars of crypto despite all regulatory sanctions which makes us think there must be something unique about the exchange. 
In this article, we will take a look at the journey of the largest exchange that went from a nearly failed startup to the ruler of the crypto world. A company which has been through good, bad and everything in between, led by a humble and visionary leader.
So, let’s begin the journey.
Origins
Prior to founding Binance, Changpeng Zhao was an entrepreneur and a tech professional. He founded Fusion Systems in 2005 in Shanghai which built a high speed trading system for stock market brokers.
In 2013, he joined Blockchain.info as the third member of the crypto wallet’s team.
Zhao started Binance in 2017 after leaving OKCoin as its CTO. He founded the company in China. However, soon he had to move out of the country because of the Chinese ban on crypto.
Binance launched its ICO which helped it attract $15 million in coin sales. This gave birth to the BNB cryptocurrency. It was initially conceived as a cryptocurrency to pay trading fee on Binance. By mid-2024, BNB commanded over $87 billion.

Investing in ICOs, Must Read These Risk Management Strategies

The cryptocurrency now has an autoburn mechanism which helps greatly in price appreciation.
Expansion
By Jan 2018, Binance became the largest crypto exchange with over $1.3 billion in valuation.
Throughout the year, Binance opened three offices in Malta, Bermuda and Jersey.
In June 2018, Binance acquired Trust Wallet, which has been one of the most popular crypto wallets.
In May 2019, Binance revealed that it became a victim of a large-scale security breach and had lost over 7000 Bitcoins valued then at $6 million.

Don’t Miss: What Happens to Crypto if Binance Goes Bankrupt?

In September 2019, Binance launched BUSD in collaboration with Paxos, a well known developer of stablecoins. Within a few years, it rose to become the third largest stablecoin after USDT and USDC. At its peak, it commanded over $23.5 billion  in market cap (November 2022). However, it had to shut down the stablecoin as its issuer Paxos was ordered by New York authorities to shut minting in early 2023.
Mature Phase
In February 2020, Binance had a brief spat with the Malta Financial Services Authority(MFSA) over regulation. The authority issued a press release stating that despite being a Maltese company, Binance was not registered with MFSA and thereby was not under its regulatory oversight.
In October 2020, the Forbes Magazine did a story on Binance which claimed that Zhao and other Binance executives designed the corporate structure in a way that would profit from the country but would avoid compliance with US regulations.
By May 2021, there were unconfirmed reports that Binance was under legal scrutiny by the Internal Revenue Service as well as by the US Department of Justice. However, it would take almost a year before US regulators finally charge Binance on paper.
In a Post-COVID World
Binance was perhaps the greatest benefactor of the COVID induced crypto bull run from 2020-2022. With lockdowns and travel restrictions all over the world, users had almost nothing to spend their money. A rising crypto trend in such times, prompted users to invest in crypto. Investments from all over the world made crypto rally faster than ever.
By the end of  2023, Binance had dominated at least 50% of the crypto market in terms of trading volumes.
Growth of Binance in 2022. Shown in Light Green
This alerted several regulators all over the world and around the same time, we saw the initial troubles of the exchange.
Controversial Stand on Russia Ukraine War
The troubles of Binance might have taken concrete shape in 2022 when after a Russian invasion of Ukraine, Binance decided not to ban Russian users from its platform. In doing so, it might have irked US authorities. However, later Binance softened their approach and donated $10 million in support of Ukraine.
In 2024, the exchange pleaded guilty to having allowed billions of dollars to flow without restriction through its exchange. It also was found guilty of having  helped users bypass the US sanctions against Russia.
The Regulatory Troubles Begin
Binance vs US SEC
On June 05, 2023, the US SEC registered a case against Binance and its 13 companies that includes Binance.com, Binance.us, BAM trading services, and the group’s co-founder Changpeng Zhao. The charges include operating unregistered exchanges, unregistered broker, dealer and clearing services, misrepresenting trader controls over Binance.us and finally the offering and sale of unregistered securities.

Binance vs US Department of Justice
The case registered against Binance by the US Department of Justice (DOJ) charged the company and its CEO of committing a violation of the Bank Secrecy Act. As per the act, it was charged with transferring money without registration. The exchange was also charged with violating US Sanctions against Russia.
Binance agreed to pay the biggest fine ever paid in corporate history. The company settled the case by the US Department of Justice after paying the latter, a sum of $4.3 billion.

Further, Changpeng Zhao, co-founder of Binance had to agree to step down as the CEO and from the Board of the US arm. 
The prosecutors had also demanded a three year sentencing. However, Zhao only received a light four month sentence due to his cooperation, clean image and clear track record.
This was possible because of several reasons. Changpeng Zhao had been a very ethical entrepreneur in his past. When the US DOJ registered the case against Binance, he had Canadian citizenship and could have easily lived a life on the run. His wealth was enough for him to sustain any lifestyle. Still, he decided to cooperate with the US DOJ and even was present physically prior to sentencing.
Another factor that greatly helped in reducing the sentencing was the letters of support that poured in the court prior to his sentencing. Several well known corporate houses, industry professionals, friends and family had vouched for Zhao being a good and ethical person. Even Zhao himself penned a letter of apology to the court, asking for forgiveness.
All of these helped him not only to clarify his own image, but also secured him a less harsh prison sentence.
Binance vs Nigeria
The case of Binance was quite unique. It was summoned by the Nigerian SEC as well as multiple agencies under the government.
It was charged by the Nigerian government to work in the country without legal registrations, facilitate illicit transactions and also engage in tax evasion.
Between late February and early March 2024, the Nigerian authorities levied a $10 billion fine on Binance for involvement in money laundering. However, the notice was soon withdrawn and the government went into denial as claims of the government strong-arming Binance surfaced. The fine was later changed to $35 million by 30th March 2024.
Further, on multiple occasions, the Nigerian house of representatives had summoned Binance executives including its CEO Richard Teng. However, the CEO did not comply with any summons yet.
Binance vs French Authorities
Binance received regulatory clearance way back in 2022. The license allowed the company to provide digital asset services in France. However, by mid-2023, the Paris prosecutor’s office had charged the exchange with money laundering in the country.
Then Binance CEO Changpeng Zhao had clarified that despite unannounced inspections, the exchange fully cooperated with the French authorities.

Later the case seems to have receded into oblivion with no further updates after June 2023.
Binance and Netherlands
In 2022, Dutch authorities put a fine on Binance for operating in the country without a proper license.
However, by June 2023, due to failure to secure the correct licenses, it had to exit the country. All its users were transferred to its rival Coinmerce.
Despite everything, the exchange had said during its exit that in the future, it would reintroduce its services in the country after obtaining proper licenses and documents.
Binance in India
Binance’s troubles were unique in India. Due to the presence of strong AML laws, and the focus on increasing compliance, the exchange was initially seen as a non-complying entity. However, that soon changed with Binance’s decision to comply.
Perhaps it was the only incident where both parties, the regulator and the company, mutually understood and agreed to each other’s needs without any collateral damage.
In India, there exists a powerful but less known regulator called the Financial Intelligence Unit (FIU). It was established to detect money laundering, financial crimes and also provide intelligence inputs to the government of India.
The FIU asked crypto exchanges operating in India, both native and international, to register with the regulator, share transactions data with it and also comply with Indian money laundering laws. However, due to a lack of response, the regulator decided to put a shadow ban on Binance.com on 27th December 2023. The URL of Binance.com was blocked for Indian users and its mobile apps were taken down from Apple and Google stores.
Binance quickly responded that it was ready to comply with Indian laws. Soon the negotiations began and by May 10, 2024, Binance finalized its initial registrations with India along with KuCoin. Within a few days, both the companies got approval and a nod to resume their operations in India. Binance also reportedly agreed to pay a $2 million fine.

Binance in the UAE
UAE is perhaps the few countries where Binance actually had ease to do business. The vision of the UAE government to make the country a crypto hub has greatly helped Binance and several other crypto businesses.  The country has been hosting several successful crypto events lately.
In June 2023, Binance received a VASP license which acted as a MVP license in Dubai and allowed Binance to establish operations. Later, on 18th April 2024, Binance received full operational license in Dubai.
The Illegality of the Legal Troubles
It’s well known that the troubles of all crypto-native companies would have been far less if countries had crypto regulations in place. Till date only a few countries have crossed the policy stage.
When the US charged Binance, it did not even have a draft policy for crypto, let alone having a concrete set of regulations. The SEC had repeatedly tried to impose its authority to regulate crypto even when it had lost a case against Ripple. That case also made it clear that any retail sales of XRP never amounted to their classification as securities.
Similarly, the prosecution of Binance under the Nigerian laws never took any concrete stand because crypto as a whole was for tax evasion, money laundering and several other crimes. Such services were provided by several other companies including those native to the country.
Countries at Various Stages of Crypto Legislation/Regulation, Source IMF
Data by WEF shows that even as late as Jan 2024, most countries are still unable to regulate crypto in its entirety. Only a few economies such as the EU, UAE, Switzerland and Japan seem to have comprehensive regulations.
Choosing a Way Forward
Battling with authorities had always proven fatal even if someone was right. The Ripple vs SEC case dragged on for years and despite a win by Ripple (in relation to the retail sales), it had to spend a huge sum, estimated at $1.3 billion, on just legal fees. Yet, the case is far from being a complete resolution.

It won’t be an overstatement to assume that Binance decided to skip all those legal headaches and went directly into resolution. Not only was it an apt decision with respect to cost, but also it helped Binance skip all the negative media attention. Further, compliance also strengthened its position in the eye of the regulators and lawmakers.

21 Giant Banks Predicted When and How Much the Fed Will Cut Interest Rates - Bitcoin Sistemi

Following the Fed's decision to keep interest rates steady, many major US banks revised their interest rate forecasts. Here's a summary of his latest predictions:
Bank of America predicts that the first reduction will be made in December 2024 and a total reduction of 25 basis points (BPS) will be made throughout the year.

Citigroup expects an earlier and larger reduction, estimating that the first reduction will be made in July 2024 and that there will be a total reduction of 100 basis points during the year. While Deutsche Bank foresees a more conservative reduction, it estimates that the first reduction will be made in December and a total reduction of 25 basis points will be made in 2024.
Evercore ISI and Goldman Sachs predict that the first interest rate cut will be made in September 2024 and that there will be a 50 basis point reduction throughout the year. HSBC also expects the first reduction to be made in September, but a total reduction of 25 basis points in 2024.

Bitcoin Whales Buy $1.34 Billion In BTC In One Day - Is Return To $70,000 Imminent? | Bitcoinist.com


								Following rumors of a potential Ethereum spot exchange-traded fund (ETF) approval, the Bitcoin price made a run at its current all-time high of $73,737. While the momentum was not sufficient to push the premier cryptocurrency to a new record price, BTC still managed to cross the $70,000 level for the first time in over a month.
Bitcoin’s price soon experienced a correction and currently sits below $70,000 despite the SEC’s eventual approval of the ETH ETF. However, the latest on-chain revelation suggests that the BTC price might resume its upward movement sooner rather than later.
Can Whale Activity Drive BTC’s Price Recovery?
In a recent post on the X platform, popular crypto pundit Ali Martinez shared that there has been significant buying activity amongst a certain class of large investors in recent days. This on-chain revelation is based on Santiment’s Balance of Whales, which tracks the total number of coins owned by whales holding between 1,000 and 10,000 BTC.

According to data from Santiment, this class of large Bitcoin holders have bought more than 20,000 BTC (equivalent to a massive $1.34 billion) in the past day. This recent acquisition brings the balance of this class of whales to a whopping total of 4.96 million BTC.

The timing of this purchase is interesting, considering its occurrence after the Bitcoin price dropped back to $67,000. Notably, Martinez said in his post that these whales are “buying the dip,” a term used to describe purchasing activity after an asset experiences a fall in price. 
What’s more, this recent purchase by the whales might be a signal that the large holders and big players might know something about the BTC future price trajectory. As such, investors might want to keep an eye out for further movements, as they can lead to speculations and potential market shifts.
Moreover, whales are often perceived as key players in the crypto market, as their buying and selling activities can impact the price of digital assets. Considering its magnitude, the recent purchase might be a bullish proponent for the price of the premier cryptocurrency.
Bitcoin Price At A Glance
As of this writing, the price of Bitcoin stands around $68,917, reflecting a mere 1% increase in the past day. On the weekly timeframe, though, the premier cryptocurrency holds a better position and is up by 3%.

                        Bitcoin Price PredictionAs Bitcoin tumbles following the SEC’s approval of ether ETFs, market analysts are closely monitoring the next key levels. Bitcoin’s price prediction indicates a potential bullish trend, with BTC/USD currently trading at $69,042.This update explores the pivotal support and resistance levels, providing insights into the future movements of Bitcoin amidst the shifting regulatory landscape.SEC Approves Rule Change for Ether ETFs
The SEC has approved a rule change to allow the creation of exchange-traded funds (ETFs) that invest in ether, one of the largest cryptocurrencies. This decision follows the recent success of bitcoin ETFs, which have seen net inflows surpassing $12 billion. The approval comes just in time, aligning with the SEC’s deadline for the VanEck Ethereum ETF decision.Companies that sponsor bitcoin ETFs, such as BlackRock, Bitwise, and Galaxy Digital, are also starting the process to launch ether ETFs. However, the SEC’s rule change does not guarantee immediate launches, as it only approves the applications from exchanges to list eight different ether funds. The actual launch dates remain uncertain.Key Points:
Ether prices rose 2% following the SEC’s decision, after a 20% surge earlier in the week.
The SEC’s order approves the listing of eight ether funds but does not set launch dates.
Initial ether ETFs are expected to be smaller than bitcoin ETFs, with the Grayscale Ethereum Trust holding about $11 billion in assets.
The approval suggests a potential easing of the SEC’s stance on cryptocurrencies, particularly following the agency’s loss in a lawsuit against Grayscale in 2023. This legal outcome paved the way for the approval of bitcoin ETFs and now ether ETFs. Despite this progress, the SEC’s regulatory approach to crypto remains under political scrutiny.Ether, the second-largest cryptocurrency, underpins the Ethereum network, which facilitates decentralized finance (DeFi) projects, nonfungible tokens (NFTs), and asset tokenization. However, the new ether ETFs in the U.S. may exclude staking, as the SEC views staking-as-a-service offerings as unregistered securities. This exclusion could reduce the attractiveness of ether ETFs compared to bitcoin ETFs.Richard Kerr from K&L Gates highlighted that the approval does not apply to other crypto projects on the Ethereum network. Steven Lubka from Swan Bitcoin pointed out that ether ETFs might experience lower demand due to structural differences, such as the lack of staking options.The approval of ether ETFs marks a notable development in the regulatory landscape for cryptocurrencies, signifying the increasing integration of digital assets into mainstream financial products.










Bitcoin Price Prediction

Bitcoin (BTC/USD) is trading at $69,042, showing a modest increase of 0.45% signalling a bullish Bitcoin price prediction. The pivot point, marked by the green line, is at $68,514, serving as a crucial level for trend direction. Immediate resistance levels are observed at $70,029, followed by $71,458 and $73,299.
On the downside, support levels are at $66,394, $64,947, and $63,490. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) is at 48.93, indicating neutral momentum, while the 50-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA) stands at $67,860, providing significant support.

Bitcoin Price Prediction

The price is bolstered by an upward trendline near the $69,000 level. The formation of a series of doji candles above this level suggests potential buying trends above $68,500.
Both the RSI and EMA support the likelihood of a continued bullish trend. Traders should watch for a break above the immediate resistance at $70,029 to confirm further upward movement.


Exciting New AI Meme Coin Wiener AI – Can It Outperform?

The fun new sausage dog-themed meme coin, Wiener AI (WAI), is more than just a novelty. It offers advanced AI-powered trading tools, adding substantial utility beyond its playful exterior.
With investors already pouring $2,880,453 into WAI’s presale, this early demand signals strong interest in the new meme coin.
In the current market, AI is a hot theme, especially after Nvidia’s impressive earnings. This trend is expected to boost demand for WAI even further.
Not only does WAI come with AI utility, but it also provides a great opportunity for earning passive income. Twenty percent of the total supply is allocated to staking rewards, offering investors a remarkable 396% APY, according to the project’s official website.

Crypto experts are eagerly buying into this exciting AI crypto coin. Michael Wrubel, a widely followed crypto analyst with over 312,000 YouTube subscribers, ranks WAI as a top crypto for 2024.
Interested investors need to act fast as the WAI price will increase when the presale reaches $3 million. The current price is $0.00071, giving WAI a market cap of under $50 million. If WAI achieves market leadership, early investors could see significant gains, with the potential for 100x returns or more.

Starknet Token Activity Dives as 3AC Liquidator Makes Major Binance Transfer


							

Three Arrows Capital liquidator Teneo transfers $2.63 million in STRK to Binance, retaining a significant $157 million worth.



Teneo emerges as a major player in the Starknet (STRK) token ecosystem, holding the second-largest non-team/CEX wallet.



STRK Price Up, Trading Volume Down: What’s Next for Starknet?




Hedge Fund Three Arrows Capital’s liquidator, Teneo, has reportedly transferred 2.18 million STRK tokens, valued at approximately $2.63 million, to Binance over the past three days. According to an X post by the blockchain analytics platform Spot On Chain, Teneo currently retains 130 million STRK, estimated to be worth $157 million.







Chinese crypto reporter Colin Wu offered further insights into Teneo’s strategic maneuver with STRK tokens. Notably, Teneo, holding a substantial portion of 3AC’s STRK tokens, has emerged as the second-largest non-team/CEX STRK-holding wallet.







As of the latest data, the Starknet token (STRK) is trading at $1.23, reflecting a slight decrease of 2.27% over the past 24 hours. However, the token has demonstrated positive momentum over the past week and month, surging by 6.10% and 3.88%, respectively.



The token currently holds the 68th position on CoinMarketCap, boasting a market capitalization of $1,408,958,143. A significant decline of nearly 50% in its 24-hour trading volume, currently at $157,940,550, suggests decreased activity within the ecosystem.



According to a previous report released in February 2024, an address identified as “Teneo: 3AC Liquidation” holds more than $602 million in crypto assets. The report revealed that the wallet was dominated by a vast collection of 75 million WLD tokens, valued at $567 million, constituting 94% of the total assets.









Other assets in the Teneo wallet included 8.437 million DYDX, valued at around $26.91 million, 160,000 AXS, worth more than $1.3 million, and 5.75 million USDC. The report also noted that 3AC creditors are among the largest holders of Worldcoin tokens (WLD).



Moving STRK tokens to Binance piques curiosity upon Teneo’s intentions. It could be a step to liquidate the tokens to pay off creditors or it could be a strategy, in part, to maximize the value of the remaining assets.

Suspicious Transaction Ahead of Elon Musk's Dogecoin Tweet! He Bought the Other Memecoin He Mentioned, How Did He Know? - Bitcoin Sistemi


There has been an interesting development in the cryptocurrency market, this time involving Elon Musk.
A cryptocurrency user created a new wallet about 1 day ago and withdrew 661 SOL worth 116 thousand dollars to this wallet via Binance. Immediately afterwards, he used all of these to buy 1.94 million memecoins called HARAMBE.


This wallet has currently made a profit of approximately 18 thousand dollars.

Although the amount of profit generated is low, it is noteworthy that this large purchase took place very shortly before Elon Musk tweeted about HARAMBE.





As it is known, Dogecoin's mascot dog Kabosu passed away at the age of 18. After this incident, Elon Musk published a message and said that Harambe, a famous gorilla who had previously passed away, and Kabosu went to heaven.
Following the development, the price of memecoin named HARAMBE increased by approximately 30%.

Bitcoin whales show ‘strong buying force’ signaling bullish bias


    Bitcoin (BTC) is currently experiencing renewed momentum, with notable buying activity from Bitcoin whales signaling a resurgence of bullish sentiment in the cryptocurrency market. 



Despite a minor 3% retreat over the past week, these major investors have shown a strong buying force, reflecting their confidence in Bitcoin’s future prospects.



Whales, defined as entities holding between 1,000 and 10,000 BTC and excluding those owned by mining companies and exchanges, play a crucial role in the dynamics of cryptocurrencies.







Following a period of relative inactivity, these significant players have once again started to increase their Bitcoin stakes significantly. 



As of May 22, there has been a 5.5% increase in their holdings, marking a notable contrast to the more cautious 4.2% growth observed in April. 



This shift underscores a change in strategy among whales, influenced by their perception of favorable current prices for purchasing and accumulating Bitcoin, as highlighted by market intelligence firm CryptoQuant.



Market reactions and analysts insights



The behavior of whales often serves as a bellwether for broader market trends. Crypto analyst Axel Adler used on-chain data to shed light on the momentum building within the Bitcoin market. 



His analysis, shared on X (formerly Twitter), pointed out that the price gradient oscillator, which measures how quickly the market cap grows compared to the realized cap, is approaching a critical level.



Realized cap considers the total value of all whale-held coins based on their purchase time rather than the current market value.

Surpassing a value of 3.0 with this oscillator could indicate a sustainable bullish trend, steering clear of the downturns witnessed in the 2021 cycle.



CryptoQuant CEO Ki Young Ju emphasized the significant rise in the 30-day percentage change in whale address holdings and the overall BTC balance held by whales.



According to him, during a sharp market dip in early May, whales acquired an additional 47,000 BTC, demonstrating their confidence in Bitcoin’s long-term value.

The exchange whale ratio, which tracks large Bitcoin holders’ activity, increased in April and May, suggesting heightened activity from these major investors. This is unusual, as typically, whale activity decreases during sustained bullish market periods.



Analyst Willy Woo observed that over the past two months, there was significant buying of Bitcoin even though its price didn’t show a clear upward trend.



Even though this caused some panic among individual investors, the demand for Bitcoin at its current market price remained strong.



Bitcoin price analysis



The market’s response to these developments has been overwhelmingly positive, with Bitcoin prices rebounding to $69,300—an increase of about 3% over the past week. The total realized cap of the Bitcoin network has reached a record high, reflecting robust market fundamentals.



However, despite this optimism, analysts like James Check from Glassnode caution that the market has not yet entered the euphoria phase typical of bull runs, suggesting there is still room for substantial growth.

The increased activity and aggressive buying patterns of Bitcoin whales are critical indicators of broader market trends.



Their continued accumulation of Bitcoin suggests a bullish outlook for the future of cryptocurrency, potentially paving the way for new market highs.

Bitcoin Is Currently out of the ‘Danger Zone,’ According to Crypto Analyst - But There’s a Catch - The Daily Hodl


								A closely followed crypto analyst says that Bitcoin (BTC) is no longer in the “danger zone,” when there is a likelihood of a dip below its range low.
Pseudonymous trader Rekt Capital tells his 472,200 followers on the social media platform X that while the “danger zone” has passed, Bitcoin could still dip about 13% from its current value.










Based on past cycles, Bitcoin enters the “danger zone” after a halving event, when miners’ rewards are halved, and declines significantly, according to the analyst. After the “danger zone,” Bitcoin historically enters a “post-halving reaccumulation” phase when it trades sideways within a range.
“Since the Bitcoin post-halving ‘danger zone’ ended, Bitcoin broke out to $71,500. However, ~$71,500 is where the range high resistance of the macro re-accumulation range is and this is where Bitcoin rejected from. The consolidation continues and history suggests it will continue for several more weeks between $60,000 and $70,000.”
Source: Rekt Capital/X
The analyst also says that based on historical precedence, Bitcoin may not break out of the range high of $70,000 until September.
“Historically, Bitcoin has always rejected from the range high on the first attempt at a breakout after the halving. Moreover, history suggests this re-accumulation should last much longer. Bitcoin tends to break out from these re-accumulation ranges only up to 160 days after the halving. That would translate to a Bitcoin breakout from the re-accumulation range only in September 2024.”

Bitcoin is trading for $69,012 at time of writing, up 2% in the last 24 hours.

3 cryptocurrencies to avoid trading this week


    Finbold identified three cryptocurrencies that speculators should avoid trading due to the upcoming substantial token unlocks. These unlocks have the potential to flood the market, leading to increased selling pressure and significant price fluctuations.



Experienced cryptocurrency market participants closely monitor factors like token supply and demand to optimize their trading strategies and mitigate potential losses. By taking these dynamics into account, they can make well-informed decisions that maximize profitability while effectively managing associated risks.



In particular, data from TokenUnlocksApp shows $373.11 million in potential sell-offs for the next seven days from May 25. The top 3 highest unlocks will happen on May 31 and June 1, releasing $219.67 million worth of tokens.

Avoid trading Optimism (OP)



First, investors should avoid trading Optimism (OP), the popular second layer for Ethereum (ETH), amid a potential sell-off incoming. On May 31, the protocol will unlock 31.34 million OP tokens currently worth $80.23 million.



Optimism’s unlock represents a nearly 3% supply inflation that repeats every month with slight variations, as previously reported by Finbold. Core contributors to the protocol will receive 16.54 million OP worth $42.35 million, while private investors will get $37.89 million to realize their monthly profits over retail buyers.

dYdX Protocol (DYDX)



The decentralized exchange protocol DYDX is again featured among cryptocurrencies to avoid trading due to its unlocks. Finbold reported a similar warning for April 27 and, previously, for March 31, with 33.34 million tokens unlocked – worth $70.33 million and $117.33 million, respectively.



On February 29, we also reported the unlock of the same amount, worth $130 million. The gradual loss of purchasing power evidence the nefarious effects of supply inflation on cryptocurrencies and the “avoid trading” alert.



Now, the protocol will put the same amount of DYDX in circulation on June 1, currently worth $70 million. This represents a nearly 12% monthly inflation likely to affect DYDX investors. As of this writing, the token trades at $2.10.

Sui Network (SUI)



Another cryptocurrency to avoid trading due to recurrent monthly token unlocks is Sui Network (SUI). The competing layer-1 blockchain developed by former Meta Platforms (NASDAQ: META) engineers will inflate its supply by 2.8% this month.



On June 1, the protocol will unlock 65.08 million SUI for private investors, the development team, and the Mysten Labs treasury. Notably, private investors will receive 39.16 million SUI for over 60% of the total $70 million worth of unlocks.

However, crypto traders will try to speculate on the economic effects these unlocks may have on price, which could bring increased volatility and worsen the potential risk-reward ratio. The market is uncertain and influenced by multiple factors, requiring proper risk management and learning when to avoid trading specific cryptocurrencies.

Bitcoin attack mode: BTC set for $150k after post-halving consolidation


    After weeks of appearing to consolidate, Bitcoin (BTC) aims to establish its price above the crucial resistance level of $70,000.



Indeed, if the crypto manages to sustain the current bullish momentum, the market anticipates that it will rally to a new record high, possibly above $100,000.



Consequently, crypto trading expert TradingShot noted in a TradingView post on May 23 that Bitcoin is forecasted to enter a new rally phase following a period of consolidation post-halving. This development aligns with historical patterns in previous Bitcoin cycles, signaling a potential surge towards $150,000. 







For instance, TradingShot noted the consistent occurrence of a two-month consolidation phase before and after the halving event, a pattern observed in past Bitcoin cycles. This consolidation phase typically precedes a significant rally in Bitcoin’s price.

Moreover, the expert also reviewed the impact of technical indicators such as the Mayer Multiple Band (MMB) and the Bollinger Bands Width (BBW). TradingShot suggested that trading above the MMB of 1 Standard Deviation (SD) indicates a bullish trend, particularly after the BBW bottoms out.  A surge has historically followed this pattern in Bitcoin’s price towards the MMB 3SD level. 



Bitcoin’s next price target 



The Vortex Indicator (VI) and the Commodity Channel Index (CCI) in the two-month time frame also highlight the symmetry in Bitcoin’s cycles. TradingShot’s analysis indicated that VI tops coincide with CCI’s first higher low after a bottom, suggesting a predictable pattern in Bitcoin’s price movements.




“As a result, we can expect the price to top by the week of March 17 2025 the earliest. <…> The most important part perhaps is that after each consolidation after the BBW bottom. Bitcoin’s immediate target was the MMB 3SD, which is the orange trend-line. That is currently at $125k but by the time the rally reaches it, it could be closer to $150k,” the analyst said. 




It’s worth noting that Bitcoin has exhibited bullish sentiments in the short term, with the crypto hitting the $71,000 mark on May 21. The rally coincided with a significant surge in spot buying and spot Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) purchasing.



As things stand, the market seems to be on edge regarding the implications of the current price movement. Some believe the recent bull run has peaked, while others suggest that a new bull run consistent with the Bitcoin post-halving price movement has begun. 



Bitcoin price analysis



By press time, Bitcoin was trading at $69,103 with daily gains of almost 2.5%. On the weekly chart, BTC is up 2.67%.

Elsewhere, Bitcoin’s technical analysis is dominated by bullish sentiments. According to data retrieved from TradingView, a summary of Bitcoin’s one-day gauges indicates a ‘buy’ at 15, while moving averages are at ‘strong buy’ at 14. Oscillators, on the other hand, are ‘neutral’ at 9.

Overall, most of the market anticipates that Bitcoin will sustain its current momentum, but a continuation of the rally significantly hinges on breaching the $70,000 resistance zone.

How Sportsbetting Giants Are Embracing Cryptocurrency: Let's Examine HugeWin



                    

Recently, the sports betting scene has shifted quite a bit. The surge in cryptocurrency isn’t just a fleeting thing—it’s reshaping the iGaming industry and now making its mark on sports betting. As more cryptocurrencies gain popularity, top sports betting platforms are catching on and embracing this innovative payment method.



The current gambling scene, in general, is starting to shift towards prioritizing player safety. With even such infrastructure like multi-factor authentication, advanced encryption systems, and more put in place to safeguard players’ assets. Cryptocurrency can accomplish just that.

Ether.Fi price breaks above key resistance, is $10 next? - CoinJournal



                    

                    
Ether.Fi price rose 10% as altcoins looked to rebound, hitting highs of $5.35 amid latest upside momentum.
ETHFI could target $10 if bullish sentiment prevails.

Ether.Fi price rose 10% to reach highs of $5.35, a seven-week peak for the Ethereum liquid restaking platform’s native token ETHFI.
Importantly, Ether.Fi price at current levels sees it trade above a crucial support-turned resistance area.
With prices up 47% this past week, can bulls strengthen to push to $10? The last breakout above $5 saw ETHFI rally to its all-time high of $8.53 on March 27.
Ether.Fi introduces ether.fi Cash
On May 24, the Ether.Fi team announced the launch of ether.fi Cash, a mobile wallet and Visa credit card that allows users to save, spend or invest with their ether.fi assets.
Cash allows users to borrow or settle everyday transactions with USDC. Users can also pay off balances using their stake and liquid rewards.
“Cash is the third in our Trilogy of products — ether.fi Stake, ether.fi Liquid, and ether.fi Cash. Combined these integrated products help users save, invest and spend their crypto, making it so that users never have to offramp again,” the protocol noted in an announcement.
ETHFI price surges past $5
Data from CoinGecko shows that ETHFI price soared alongside major altcoins as Ethereum spiked earlier in the week. The ETH price reacted sharply to news of an impending spot ETF approval, reaching highs of $3,900.
The upside momentum also impacted ecosystem tokens, with ETHFI bouncing from lows of $3.23.

Although price faced an initial rejection at the horizontal resistance line, a retest of the area saw bulls break higher to hit $5.35 on May 23.

The Relative Strength Index (RSI) on the daily chart is at 66 to suggest the upper hand is with the buyers. Also, the MACD indicator is strengthening above the signal line to reflect an overall bullish outlook for ETHFI.
If bulls flip the key resistance zone into a robust support area, a surge to $6.14 could see them aim for the ATH.

Crypto Casino as a New Trend: Let's Examine on the Example of Hugewin



                    

Cryptocurrencies have been popular and in demand ever since the creation asset was created. However, community members recently experienced an unprecedented surge in demand for this technical innovation. The surge permeated various sectors, from finance to retail, but its impact is perhaps most pronounced in the iGaming industry.



A recent study by Grand View Research revealed that the worldwide online gambling market, which stood at $66.72 billion in 2020, is predicted to grow at a compound annual growth rate of 11.5% from 2021 through 2028. A key driver of this growth is the adoption of cryptocurrencies, which provide a fast, secure, and efficient means of transaction that appeals to modern gamers.




Additionally, findings from a CryptoGamblingNews survey indicated that over 60% of respondents prefer using cryptocurrencies for online gambling due to their quick transaction times and the anonymity they offer.



Why cryptocurrency is perfect for iGaming



The inherent features of cryptocurrency make it a suitable and successful pairing. Here’s why:




Comprehensive security measures. Since crypto utilizes blockchain technology, which is renowned worldwide for its secure but transparent way of storing data, the risks of fraud (which were quite common within the online casino industry of the past) are virtually zero.



Enhanced transaction speeds. Cryptocurrencies are transforming various industries due to their rapid transaction speeds surpassing traditional banking systems. This makes it an ideal fit for the iGaming industry, where fast, seamless transactions are crucial.



Global accessibility. Cryptocurrencies transcend geographical boundaries, making them accessible worldwide. Players from different countries can participate easily without the hassle of currency conversion or international banking restrictions.



Anonymity and privacy. Using cryptocurrencies allows players to maintain a higher level of anonymity since they don’t need to provide sensitive personal information. This privacy is especially appealing in the iGaming sector, where discretion is often valued.



Lower fees. Cryptocurrency transactions typically have lower fees than traditional banking methods. This cost-efficiency benefits players and gaming platforms, making it a more attractive option for financial transactions.



Enhanced credibility. The decentralized framework of cryptocurrencies, along with the permanent recordkeeping of blockchain transactions, fosters user trust. This allows players to confirm transactions and verify game fairness, which is essential for upholding integrity in the iGaming landscape, especially for a cryptogames casino and crypto slot games.




These features collectively make cryptocurrencies an ideal choice for the iGaming industry, providing a secure, efficient, and user-friendly experience for both players and operators.

Kim Jong Crypto (KIMCRYPT) to Explode 14,000% Ahead of Bitrue Listing, as Shiba Inu, Bonk and Dogecoin Lag



                    

Early investors in memecoins like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Bonk (BONK) and Dogecoin (DOGE) made astronomical returns, and Kim Jong Crypto (KIMCRYPT) presents a similar opportunity for a limited time.



Kim Jong Crypto (KIMCRYPT), a newly launched Solana memecoin, is poised to explode over 14,000% in a matter of days, as former Shiba Inu (SHIB), Bonk (BONK) and Dogecoin (DOGE) investors pour funds into this new token.




KIMCRYPT will be listed on Bitrue, one of the largest centralized exchanges in the world, within a few days – and this is a massively bullish development for the token, as millions of new investors will easily be able to buy Kim Jong Crypto.



Currently, Kim Jong Crypto can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jupiter and Raydium, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days.



To buy KIMCRYPT on these platforms, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Kim Jong Crypto by entering its contract address – DY225ypZiG3aYkZnzaXJYDGtUz76uNuQiJLMzs6qGAZ5 – in the receiving field.




KIMCRYPT currently has a market cap of just under $13,000, with over $4,000 in locked liquidity, meaning it has huge upside potential.



Early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and Bonk (BONK) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price.



If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner.

Ether Poised to Surge Past $5,000 as Key Indicators Flash Bullish Signals



                    

Ether (ETH) could potentially retest the $5,000 price mark it narrowly missed in 2021 if three long-term indicators continue their current trends, according to one crypto trader.



“The dominance chart suggests we’re entering an ‘ETH Season’ where Ethereum is likely to outperform other cryptocurrencies,” said pseudonymous crypto trader Blockchain Mane in an interview with Cointelegraph.




This optimism follows the United States Securities and Exchange Commission’s (SEC) initial approval of eight spot Ether exchange-traded funds (ETFs) on May 23.



Data from TradingView reveals that ETH’s market dominance surged by 19.56% over the past week after reports suggested the SEC was shifting its stance on ETF approvals.



Blockchain Mane highlighted another key long-term indicator: the Fibonacci retracement. 




This indicator predicts potential price levels where Ether might rebound, based on mathematical patterns from the Fibonacci sequence.



According to Mane, ETH is showing “resistance targets at $5,080.60 and $6,231.83.” 



These levels are significantly higher than its all-time high of $4,878 in November 2021, as reported by CoinMarketCap.



At the time of publication, Ether is trading at $3,802.

The third indicator noted by Blockchain Mane is the parabolic curve, which identifies potential trend changes by placing dots above or below Ether’s price movements.



Mane observed that ETH is following a “bullish trend” along the curve, with three distinct phases: base one, base two, and base three.



“The parabolic curve indicates continued upward movement, especially after the falling wedge breakout,” Mane said.



Meanwhile, other crypto traders are focusing on shorter-term price actions amid the spot Ether ETF approvals.



“ETH is up more this week than the S&P 500 typically gives you in a year,” crypto commentator Benjamin Cowen said in a May 23 X post.



Crypto trader Matthew Hyland emphasized the importance of Ether holding support around $3,800 for continued momentum.



The price of Ether has remained relatively stable following the ETF approvals, likely because the news was already priced in and ETF trading has not yet begun.

Ethereum's Pectra Upgrade: Stakes Raised for Validators, Smart Contracts Get Smarter


							

Ethereum’s Pectra upgrade is expected by Q1 2025 amid complex feature integration.



EVM Object Format and EIP-7702 by Vitalik Buterin are included in Pectra.



The Pectra upgrade will raise the staking cap for Ethereum validators from 32 ETH to 2,048 ETH.




Ethereum core developers are targeting the launch of the Pectra upgrade by the end of the first quarter of 2025. This upgrade encompasses the EVM Object Format (EOF), a suite of approximately 11 Ethereum Improvement Proposals (EIPs), which will introduce an optional container for EVM code.



Notably, Pectra, the next phase of the Ethereum network upgrade after Dencun, was initially expected to go live later this year. However, the shift from the previously projected late 2024 timeline is attributed to the inclusion of the EOF.



The Pectra upgrade is poised to raise the staking cap for Ethereum validators from 32 ETH to 2,048 ETH, as proposed in EIP 7251. This 64-fold increase would benefit major staking services like Coinbase and Lido by allowing them to consolidate their validators.



This change would streamline operations by reducing the need to create new validators for every additional 32 ETH staked, thus saving resources and effort in the staking and validation processes.



Another notable feature of the Pectra upgrade is PeerDAS, a data availability sampling solution that leverages the existing peer-to-peer components within the Ethereum ecosystem. This is expected to enhance the network’s scalability and efficiency.









Moreover, Ethereum developers have agreed to replace the account abstraction proposal EIP-3074 with the newly introduced EIP-7702, authored by Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin. EIP-7702 is designed to allow externally owned accounts (EOAs) to operate as smart contract wallets within a transaction, potentially enhancing flexibility and security for users.



Following the Dencun update, Pectra merges the “Prague” and “Electra” upgrades for execution and consensus layers, respectively. While the final details of the upgrade are still being debated, there is a possibility of deferring certain features, such as the Verkle tree implementation, to a later hard fork, namely the Osaka hard fork.

With the broader digital currency ecosystem tilting toward tokenization, Ripple CTO David Schwartz has hinted at some of the important benefits of this technological advancement.Benefits of tokenizationThe concept of tokenization has been flying around, however, only a few understand or know what it really means. Taking to the Ripple Labs’ new X series of explaining a blockchain concept in 60 seconds, the Ripple CTO used real estate to explain the tokenization concept.He said, with a lot of paperwork involved in buying an asset, it becomes fairly difficult to prove ownership of such properties. He believes tokenization eliminates this challenge by solidifying the process of asset transfer and ownership. He said, with distributed ledger technologies, real estate sales recording, payment for properties and taking away all fraud factors becomes possible. He went on to point out how this ledger simplifies the process of borrowing against an asset. With tokenization, the person’s collateral can be registered on-chain and the lender can easily verify the ownership of the collateral. Depending on the key designs of the tokenization features, the lender may also gain insight that will show whether or not the person is borrowing from a number of lenders at the same time.Many financial giants are already trialing tokenization features, with BlackRock also joining the trend. Protocols like Chainlink are specifically helping to fuel this tokenization agenda with its CCIP solution among others.Ripple Labs positioningWhile Ripple Labs has not categorically stated the road map in its own tokenization agenda, the firm has immediate plans to launch a stablecoin later this summer. In its latest push, Ripple Labs has filed a trademark for its stablecoin, showing it hopes to use the ticker symbol "RLUSD."The stablecoin ecosystem is growing, and Ripple is optimistic to tap into the market in a dominant way.

Ethereum to Launch Next Network Upgrade in Q1 2025


Ethereum core developers are gearing up for the highly anticipated “Pectra” upgrade, set to launch by the end of the first quarter of 2025. 
This significant update will introduce the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) Object Format (EOF), incorporating approximately 11 Ethereum Improvement Proposals (EIPs). EOF aims to enhance the EVM code through an opt-in container system, marking a pivotal development in Ethereum’s evolution.

Ethereum’s Next Big Upgrade Coming Q1 2025
One of the standout features of the Pectra upgrade is PeerDAS, a data availability sampling solution. PeerDAS leverages existing peer-to-peer components within Ethereum to ensure efficient data distribution and availability. This innovation aims to bolster the network’s resilience and performance, addressing current scalability challenges.
Interestingly, developers will replace the account abstraction EIP-3074 with a more advanced proposal, EIP-7702, introduced by Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin. EIP-7702 allows Externally Owned Accounts (EOAs) to function as smart contract wallets during transactions. Subsequently streamlining the user experience and enhancing security.

“This EIP is designed to be very forward-compatible with endgame account abstraction, without over-enshrining any fine-grained details of ERC-4337 or RIP-7560,” the proposal stated.

Pectra’s architecture includes two critical components. First, the Prague upgrade on the Execution Layer, and second, the Electra upgrade on the Consensus Layer. These updates collectively aim to optimize transaction processing and network consensus mechanisms, ensuring a more robust and efficient blockchain.

Howey Test Ignored by SEC, Alleges Coinbase


Coinbase leveraged current political movements in the US Congress to bolster its interlocutory appeal against the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).
In a May 24 court filing, Coinbase argued that the SEC tried to “side-step” the Howey test, which is a legal framework used to determine assets that qualify as securities. Over the years, the crypto industry and the SEC have battled over applying this standard to digital assets.
Coinbase Accuses SEC of Ignoring Howey Test

Paul Grewal, Coinbase’s Chief Legal Officer, explained the exchange’s position. According to him, the core question was whether the SEC can regulate cryptocurrency transactions as “investment contracts” when no contractual obligations exist. 
Grewal noted the SEC’s inconsistency and highlighted its similar appeal in the Ripple case. He stressed the importance of this unresolved legal issue for the crypto industry. The executive also contended that the SEC has an extensive history of being uncooperative with industry leaders.

“From the beginning, we came to the SEC with good-faith efforts to have a conversation about a workable and balanced regulatory framework for crypto innovation within the US. Instead, we – like much of the industry – have been met with slammed doors, changing positions, and litigation,” Grewal said.

Remarkably, Coinbase also pointed out recent legislative developments that could impact the SEC’s jurisdiction on the emerging industry. During the past week, the US House of Representatives passed the Financial Innovation and Technology for the 21st Century Act (FIT21), which could shift more regulatory power to the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC). 
This bill, staunchly opposed by SEC Chair Gary Gensler, aims to oversee the crypto markets and enjoys strong support from industry stakeholders.

“Legislators’ disagreement with the SEC’s position meanwhile has deepened: just this week, the U.S. House of Representatives approved on a bipartisan basis comprehensive digital asset legislation that would deny the SEC the expansive jurisdiction it claims,” Coinbase wrote.

Grewal highlighted this development as a positive shift in the political landscape and a step toward better regulatory oversight. He also reiterated Coinbase’s commitment to obtaining clarity for the industry and resisting overreach by regulators.

“Earlier this week, the House recognized the need for clear rules, and we’re seeking clarity in the Courts as well. But regardless of the timeline, we’re committed to seeing this through â€“ no matter how long it takes to get clarity for the entire industry and push back against overzealous regulators. It’s what the 52 million Americans who own crypto deserve,” Grewal remarked.

ETH vs. ADA: Is Cardano or Ethereum a Better Investment in 2024?


																Markets got a big spike in Ethereum price this week on crypto exchanges. What’s behind it and what factors can investors take into consideration to determine whether Ether or its friend Cardano is the better buy?
Ethereum has a birthday coming up on July 30. It was launched in 2015 to create a “world computer” with the same Web3 blockchain properties as Bitcoin has for storing cash and making payments.
Cardano was launched on September 23, 2017 by initial coin offering (ICO) and founded by an Ethereum co-founder, Charles Hoskinson. Today it’s the 10th largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization.
Ethereum Market Cap (May 22): $451.8 billion
Cardano Market Cap (May 22): $17.2 billion
Certain differences between the two cryptocurrencies are an advantage for one or the other and a good reason to be bullish or bearish for ETH or ADA tokens.




But some of the two networks’ differences are tradeoffs that are more complex to evaluate as yielding an advantage for either crypto. Here are 7 key factors at play in the future Ethereum price against Cardano:
1. ETH vs. ADA – Technical Analysis (a tie)
Ethereum price is nearly all the way back to its ATH (all time high) after spiking this week on Ethereum spot ETF buzz. Cardano has a long way to go. That might actually be more bullish for ADA, with more upside left in its price.
The recent Ethereum ETF approval will shake up the entire meta for investing in Ether. If bulls take the price past $4,000, another 12.5% increase would pump ETH to $4,500— within striking range of the previous Ethereum ATH of $4,721 in Nov. 2021.
Forbes recently mentioned an Ethereum price prediction of $5,000 by the end of 2024. Bitcoin ETF issuer VanEck predicts $11,800 by 2030. An even more bullish outlook forecasts $10,000 ETH by the end of the year.
Over the short term, Cardano technical indicators and moving averages over the weekly span recommended “Sell” on Thursday. Meanwhile, Ethereum technical indicators for the seven-day span recommended “Strong Buy,” according to data from Investing.com.
2. Ether Spot ETF – Regulatory Analysis (bullish ETH)
There’s no denying it. Charles Hoskinson would certainly agree: U.S. regulators seem to favor Bitcoin and Ethereum over Cardano and other DeFi networks.
The SEC said okay to Ethereum futures ETFs in October, revealing it didn’t seem to think of Ether as an unregistered security. However, the U.S. regulator has classified Cardano and other cryptocurrencies as unregistered securities in lawsuits against multiple blockchain companies, while ignoring Bitcoin and Ether.
As Fortune Magazine reported on May 1, “Furthermore, despite launching a number of lawsuits against crypto companies since April 2023, the agency has never named Ether to be a security in its complaints.”
The SEC lawsuit against Ripple has taken years (since Dec. 2020) and still has not yet been resolved. It is costly and leaves the future unsure for the currencies under the government’s crosshairs.
Markets abhor uncertainty.
It may not be fair, but it’s a bullish factor for ETH and bearish for ADA.
3. ADA vs. ETH – Fundamental Analysis (a wash)
Fundamental analysis is the preferred method of investors who are not total degenerates. Instead of chart technical analysis or meme currency voodoo economics, the fundamentalist looks at an investment prospect and asks what would “The Intelligent Investor” author Benjamin Graham do if he were here?
Graham says:
“The intelligent investor is a realist who sells to optimists and buys from pessimists. In the short run, the market is a voting machine but in the long run, it is a weighing machine.”
If a business’s expected future revenues discounted to the present day exceed its current market value, then it may be a good investment. If they match or fall short of the business’s market cap, then it may be a poor investment.
ADA: $263.8 million TVL (3% annual reward rate + 121% annual growth rate) / Market Cap: $16.4 Billion
ETH $64.9 Billion TVL (5.5% annual reward rate + 145% annual growth rate) / Market Cap: $453 Billion
Going by the data above without any further context, it appears Cardano would be the winner, because its inflows make up a much smaller portion of its market cap than Ethereum (0.019 to 0.22), but only if we expect it to grow at the same rate as Ethereum in the future.
The lopsided institutional adoption between the two will make that difficult for Cardano unless it finds a use case, a feature/benefit, and a narrative that shakes up the retail Internet markets for cryptocurrency.
4. Cardano vs. Ethereum – Gas Fees (cat’s game)
There are lower and more predictable fees on Cardano, but higher fees on Ethereum are also a feature, not necessarily a bug. They make it more expensive to misuse the network for cybercrime that doesn’t pay, so it’s more secure. Big institutions like that.
That’s one reason why the industry leader, Bitcoin’s slow, expensive network, with a low transaction bandwidth holds its capital so well. In many ways these built-in costs qualify participants better than Know Your Customer policies and automatically and without discriminating on any basis other than ability and willingness to pay the network’s fees.
Still for newcomers, enterpreneurs, startups, and investors starting out with a smaller cash pile, smart contract blockchain networks with lower fees like Cardano have an advantage. Transaction fees on both networks are highly variable and spike during periods of high network use.
5. Ease Of Use – Cardano (another tie)
Some people in Web3 feel Ethereum has an ease-of-use problem. It’s become too overgrown with complicated, byzantine layers on top of layers, creating a steeper learning curve and potential security threats.
Blockchain advocate Daniel Cawrey wrote in a recent opinion article on Blockworks:
“Ethereum is becoming a multilayered lasagna-like system whereby complexity and fees are pushing people to the margins, causing interoperability and security concerns.”
While true, much like Ethereum’s higher transactions fees— the complexity of Ethereum may be a reason to be bullish for ETH. It could simply be proof of the network’s success. As Cawrey acknowledges in the piece, the network is beginning to achieve its “world computer” concept.
Any computer architecture expert would be hard-pressed to explain how a Turing-complete global computer that anyone can use on a peer-to-peer network would become anything but a flying spaghetti monster of complexity.
6. Ether vs. Cardano Whales (bullish ADA)
A massive 15,000 ETH whale deposit to Kraken on May 18 spotted by Whale Alert suggested a bear run on Ether by whales could be incoming, but after the SEC approved the spot Ethereum ETF a surge in whale-sized transactions has been net positive for the network, according to IntoTheBlock data.
Meanwhile, Cardano whales have been extremely bullish for ADA in May. They boosted holdings in Cardano tokens by 11% in a month. Whales tend to be smart money with some of the most advanced analytics and market outlooks to know what they’re doing, so that’s positively bullish for Cardano.
https://x.com/intotheblock/status/1790774801277042863
7. Ethereum vs. Cardano Memes (bullish ETH)
Meme coins are a definite advantage for Ethereum. While Cardano does have meme coins, none of them are notable and they have not topped the market cap charts like Ethereum’s SHIB, PEPE, and FLOKI.
Cardano has succeeded in making a simpler, lower-fee Ethereum, but crypto markets tend to reward projects that leaven their technology with some meme karma. Maybe an Orange Pill Moon Boys NFT collection or something with a dog on it would do the trick.

'Severely undervalued,' says influencer on PEPE, but activity suggests otherwise


    In the vast and still experimental cryptocurrency market, influencers and enthusiasts often share insights into their favorite cryptocurrencies. Usually, they will hold these assets as personal investments—a normal behavior expected from someone enthusiastic about an asset.



However, influencers can use their influence to lure exit liquidity for tokens they hold but do not plan to keep in the long term. This is what recent on-chain and social activities suggest could have happened to a known meme coin trader.



Notably, Lookonchain spotted a possible divergence between words and on-chain activity from James Wynn (@JamesWynnReal) on X on May 25.







Influencer James Wynn’s PEPE dilemma



As the on-chain analyst reported, Wynn recently deposited $7.54 million worth of 491 billion PEPE to a Binance account. Etherscan data shows the deposit occurred at 07:31 a.m. +UTC under the transaction ID ‘0xb46…3afd5c.’



0xb46b036c6ed411d86bdab8fc0990af9a681b5e1d2635efd8f539fd6c573afd5c. Source: Etherscan



Interestingly, the influencer then posted that “PEPE is still severely undervalued” one hour after the deposit. According to screenshots taken and shared by Lookonchain, James Wynn continued with two other bullish-biased posts related to PEPE.







These posts are currently inaccessible because the trader locked his account on X.

Depositing from a self-custody wallet to crypto exchanges usually means an intention to sell and is a commonly used indicator.



Previously, Wynn spent $8,524 to buy 2.83 trillion PEPE, which equals $44.4 million at current prices. The influencer has been partially selling this amount over time. Now, his most recent activity dumped nearly half of the remaining reserves held at jwynn.eth.



As of this writing, the account still holds 476.8 billion PEPE, worth approximately $7.48 million.



PEPE, meme coins, and the Greater Fool Theory



Meme coins, such as PEPE, often lack fundamental value and are driven by hype and social media buzz. Traders who buy these coins are essentially gambling in the hope that someone else will buy them at a higher price.



This mentality aligns with the “Greater Fool Theory,” which suggests that profits can be made by buying overvalued assets and selling them to a “greater fool.” 



Moreover, this theory highlights the inherent risk of such investments, as the market eventually runs out of willing buyers. When the hype dies down and demand dwindles, traders can be left holding worthless cryptocurrencies, leading to substantial financial losses.



In closing, this recent activity demonstrates the importance of not blindly following crypto influencers to make investment decisions.

Coinbase Strengthens Case For Interlocutory Appeal In Latest Petition


								The long-drawn legal battle between Coinbase and the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) continues to provide more twists and turns in what may be a pivotal case in crypto regulatory history. In a recent development, the American crypto exchange has now filed a response to the commission’s petition against an initial motion for an interlocutory appeal in this contentious legal case.


Coinbase Sends Fiery Response To SEC As Appeal Saga Thickens
On April 12, Coinbase approached the US court seeking clarification on whether an investment contract can be formed with no post-sale obligations. The crypto exchanges consider this issue as a “controlling question of law” critical to its ongoing case with the SEC. 
In response, the SEC argued that there was no need for the court to certify such an interlocutory appeal as the existing securities regulations, especially the Howey Test, have proven sufficient for decades. In particular, the Commission stated that no court had ever requested a post-sale contract following the use of the test in the past. 
However, in a fresh Memorandum of Law submitted on Friday, May 24, Coinbase addresses this statement saying that the interlocutory appeal revolves around a novel issue in that “no appellate court has addressed whether a digital asset transaction carrying no post-sale obligations can be an ‘investment contract’ under Howey”. 
In addition, the exchange accuses the SEC of avoiding the “controlling question of law” in its counter-motion by diverting attention to the controversy with the application of the Howey Test to cryptocurrency transactions rather than Coinbase’s petition which seeks guidance on Howey’s application to digital assets.


Coinbase Seeking For ‘Stylish’ Court Victory
Finally, in Coinbase’s latest petition, the exchange reiterated the potential importance of this interlocutory appeal on the outcome of its legal case with the SEC. The defendant’s lawyers stressed that with a favorable outcome, over 70% of the SEC complaints could be rendered invalid. 
A statement from the petition read: 
Most of the SEC’s 116 recently-served document requests and all of its 32 requests for admission, 10 third-party subpoenas, and 9 requests for inspection are about Coinbase’s platform and Prime services rather than the unrelated staking program. This portends a discovery process, motion practice, and a trial skewed heavily toward claims centering on the “ecosystems” of 12 distinct tokens—claims that are destined to consume substantial judicial and party resources but that, with interlocutory review, could be out of the case.

On June 6, 2023, the SEC charged Coinbase with accusations of operating as an unlicensed securities exchange, broker, and clearing agency. Considering Coinbase’s status as the largest US exchange, the result of this is tipped by many to have massive effects on regulations in the country’s burgeoning crypto industry.

Bitcoin rises, Ether gets an ETF boost, and Donald Trump takes crypto

Illustration: Craig Hastings (Getty Images)The U.S. House of Representatives passed a crypto market structure bill on Wednesday evening that aims to regulate the industry at large.The bill, “The Financial Innovation and Technology for the 21st Century Act” (FIT21), would effectively classify cryptocurrency as a commodity, not a security, and therefore exempt from securities regulations. It would also determine oversight of cryptocurrencies, whether they should be regulated by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) or the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC). Read More

Will 'Coinbase effect' have a role to play in FLOKI's price targets? - AMBCrypto



FLOKI’s price appreciated by over 3.5% in the last 24 hours 
Market indicators hinted at a sustained price hike on the charts 

FLOKI bulls continue to dominate the market as the memecoin’s weekly and daily price charts remained green, at press time. Things can get even better for the altcoin, however, especially since a major exchange has now announced FLOKI’s listing – An update that can propel further growth in the coming days. 
Coinbase lists FLOKI
CoinMarketCap’s data revealed that FLOKI has been enjoying a comfortable weekly rally as its value surged by more than 8.8% in the last 7 days. In fact, in the last 24 hours alone, the memecoin’s price spiked by 3.5%. 
At the time of writing, the memecoin was trading at $0.0002264 with a market capitalization of over $2.16 billion. However, it was surprising to note that despite the bullish price action, FLOKI’s weighted sentiment dropped. Simply put, bearish sentiment retained its dominance in the altcoin’s market.
Additionally, its social volume declined over the last few days as well. 
Source: Santiment
However, this might change after Coinbase announced that it has listed FLOKI perpetual futures. The memecoin’s official X handle mentioned in a tweet that its fresh Coinbase listing will significantly enhance FLOKI’s market liquidity.
 Coinbase listings often have a bullish impact on the listed token’s price, which is commonly referred to as the “Coinbase effect.” If such an episode happens on this occasion, then FLOKI’s bull rally might get a further push and help spur the memecoin’s fainting momentum. 
FLOKI bulls to dominate more?
AMBCrypto then analyzed Santiment’s data to find out whether metrics supported the possibility of further growth. We found that FLOKI’s MVRV ratio remained relatively high, which can be inferred as a bullish signal. 
However, the memecoin’s trading volume dropped last week after spiking on 22 May. On top of that, the crypto’s network growth also declined, meaning that fewer new addresses were created to transfer the token. 
Source: Santiment
Nonetheless, market indicators continued to remain bullish. For example, the Chaikin Money Flow (CMF) registered an uptick. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) also went north, indicating that the chances of FLOKI continuing its rally were high.

If the bull rally continues, then the first target for FLOKI would be $0.00024 as liquidation would rise, which can result in a short-term price correction.
A successful breakout above this level would allow the memecoin to hit $0.00026–$0.00027. However, if the trend changes and the memecoin goes down, then FLOKI might drop to its support level near $0.000226.

Shibarium Is Close to Breaching Important Milestone

Shibarium, the Shiba Inu-backed Ethereum Layer-2 scaling solution, is showcasing a mixed growth outlook, however, with the tendency to hit a major milestone soon. Per data from its dedicated explorer Shibariumscan, the L2 protocol is eyeing hitting the 5,000,000 total block production milestone.Shibarium's erratic statisticsSince its inception, Shibarium has maintained a steady growth pace in all key metrics, except for its erratic daily transaction count. Despite powering one of the most vibrant Web3 ecosystems, its average daily transaction count has slumped from at least 1 million in Q4, 2023, to just 5,150 today.Despite this epic slump, block production remains steady. At the time of writing, a total of 4,900,607 blocks have been produced on Shibarium, leaving just 99,393 blocks to hit the 5 million milestone. At its current pace, chances are that it might hit this record before the end of this second quarter.Another crucial data insight on Shibarium is the total transactions and wallet address features. While total transactions come in at 417,549,926, the wallet address count is pegged at 1,803,996. This data shows that Shibarium is thriving within its own ecosystem of dApps.Boosting Shibarium with ShibaSwapSince its inception in August 2023, Shibarium has charted its growth course in a majorly organic manner. This is about to change as the protocol has welcomed ShibaSwap, its dominant decentralized exchange (DEX).As an exchange with many unique visitors, the expectation is that in the long run, ShibaSwap can help drive the transaction rebound as well as attract new users into the Shibarium ecosystem.With the Ethereum L2 ecosystem recording intense competition, Shibarium is looking at competing following its latest hard fork event on the mainnet. With faster speed, predictable gas cost and transaction throughput, hitting the anticipated milestone appears inevitable.

Ethereum’s Muted Response to ETF Approval: A Calm Before the Storm?


							

Ethereum price increases slightly after long-awaited SEC approval of spot ETFs.



Ethereum traders have lost $23.33 million to liquidation in the last 24 hours.



Analysts expect the spot ETFs to bring more demand to the Ethereum market.




The market value of Ethereum (ETH) registered only a modest uptick over the last 24 hours despite the SEC approval of eight spot Ethereum ETFs.



At the last check, Ethereum traded at $3,742, representing a 2.76% increase from the previous day, although its weekly performance reflects a more substantial gain. In comparison, Bitcoin surged 4%, setting a daily high of $69,222, with a similar percentage growth over its weekly performance.



Notably, in the build-up to the ETF approvals, Ethereum experienced heightened optimism. The asset soared by 40% to reclaim the $3,943 price point on Thursday, having traded at as low as $2,815 on May 1.



Meanwhile, the positive sentiment surrounding Ethereum waned after ETF approvals. Data from market tracker Coinglass indicated that following the SEC’s approval of Ethereum spot ETF listings on May 23, ETH traders witnessed $80.3 million in long liquidations.



For context, a long position involves purchasing an asset with the expectation of selling it at a higher price in the future. As of the latest figures, traders betting against the Ethereum uptrend are now the ones mostly in losses. In particular, Ethereum shorts have lost $23.33 million in the last 24 hours, amid ETH’s 2.76% uptick.



Source | Coinglass



While Ethereum has yet to see substantial gains since the ETH approvals, industry experts remain confident that it will soon set new all-time highs.



Chris Donovan, COO of the NEAR Protocol, expressed optimism for the crypto industry in the wake of the Ethereum spot ETF approval. Donovan believes that the approval is a strong endorsement for the entire crypto sector and could lead to significant and improved demand entering the market.









The approval of Ethereum spot ETFs marks a pivotal moment for the cryptocurrency industry, signaling growing acceptance among institutional investors. Even as the market adjusts to the surprise SEC approval, the optimism expressed by industry figures like Chris Donovan suggests that this could be just the beginning of Ethereum’s next bull run.

Private stablecoins will be the bedrock of on-chain commerce - Blockworks


One of the most common misconceptions about blockchain technology is that it’s synonymous with privacy. Instead, the reality is that public blockchains like Bitcoin or Ethereum are more of an open book than a lockbox of user information. They are transparent by default, and every single transaction that takes place on them is visible to anyone using a block explorer.
While this has numerous benefits — including fulfilling the dream of a more accountable financial system — it also has its drawbacks. When it comes to commerce and other use cases, some variations in how these blockchains are implemented might be appreciated by end users and enterprise projects alike. Private stablecoins, in particular, are key to this type of adoption.
Parity with TradFi is the least we can do
As crypto and digital assets become more widely adopted, the transparency that exists in public blockchains becomes more problematic. The perils of doxxing that now exist in terms of personally identifiable information will start to extend to personal financial information as well, leaving many vulnerable to bad actors.
Despite this, recent developments like Google’s decision to index ENS balances and transactions have made personal financial information on Web3 more public than ever before. And while these balances are generally held in pseudonymous accounts, their IRL identities are usually traceable by sufficiently interested parties, as some controversial Web3 projects have demonstrated.
What happens then, if we assume that the Web3 community’s ambition to bring more and more financial activity on-chain, becomes reality? 
On one hand, we’ve solved the primary problem of adoption thanks to stablecoins, albeit sans privacy. Today, we use robust stablecoins that let us work around crypto’s volatility for many kinds of on-chain commerce activities, including popular DeFi applications. 
Read more from our opinion section: Stablecoins bots are a feature, not a bug
On the other hand, on-chain commerce will never fully take off without the same level of privacy that exists in traditional finance because most users expect the same level of privacy and ease that they get with their banking app on their smartphone — and reasonably so. 
It’s not hard to see why the current open book nature of public blockchains is a cause for concern for many would-be users and enterprise adopters. 
Private stablecoins are the absolute bedrock of any Web3 analogue for commerce use cases. We can’t achieve parity with traditional finance without getting this right.
Taking on-chain commerce a step further than TradFi
We’re already starting to reap the benefits of all the great research and advances in zk technology that took place during the bear market. This is enabling new features that protect users’ financial information by allowing them to prove necessary information without revealing balances or transactions publicly. 
The ongoing integration of this technology with stablecoins will pave the way for on-chain commerce to thrive. Moreso, it will add security and privacy benefits that did not exist in traditional finance and Web2 environments.
The first example of where these features can have an impact goes back to personal security. Private stablecoins based on zk technology (and current work on cost reductions for proof verifications) eliminate the need for expensive custodians through built-in security and anonymization features.
Then, we can look at the implications for enterprise adopters. Private stablecoins can provide competitive security and protection against espionage by obscuring transaction trails for stablecoins and securing sensitive business operations.
Enhanced privacy features using zk technology can also mask financial details of employees to prevent reverse-engineering of payroll data when salaries are distributed using stablecoins. This kind of non-custodial security solution could reduce vulnerabilities even further by decentralizing payroll management with employees controlling their own transactions.
Finally, we can look at the need for private stablecoins from a compliance perspective. We can program regulatory compliance into stablecoins in such a way that they’re tailored to meet legal standards, maximizing privacy and security at the same time. 
In these cases, compliance can be proven to relevant authorities via zk proofs that don’t disclose any additional information publicly. This would create a healthier balance between transparency and privacy for stablecoin users in on-chain commerce.
A slow but steady path towards private on-chain commerce
The need for private stablecoins for on-chain commerce is part of a broad, important and ongoing conversation around the need for financial privacy in Web3. The decentralized and open source nature of Web3 means innovation is happening quickly, but the right implementation by Web3 projects can be somewhat slower. 
Many of the features that are being made possible by the integration of zk technology into stablecoins are a work in progress. It’s absolutely crucial that we move forward with private stablecoins as soon as possible. Otherwise, a truly on-chain economy will be a permanent pipedream.

Attention: Giant Bankruptcy Firm Starts Sales in This Altcoin - Holding 10 Percent of Total Supply - Bitcoin Sistemi


Teneo, the liquidator of the bankrupt cryptocurrency company Three Arrows Capital (3AC), has made some interesting transactions, according to onchain data.
According to the data, the organization moved 2.18 million Starknet (STRK) tokens, worth approximately $2.63 million, to Binance in the last three days. These appear to be STRK tokens that Teneo recovered from 3AC and sold to pay its buyers.


Notably, Teneo currently owns another 130 million STRK in Three Arrows Capital's bankruptcy assets. This corresponds to approximately 157 million dollars.
With $157 million in assets, Teneo is the second largest holder of STRK tokens, excluding developer and exchange wallets.






Starknet has a total market cap of $1.4 billion, meaning Teneo owns approximately 10% of the total STRK supply in assets.
However, almost 90% of STRK tokens are still uncirculated, bringing the token's fully diluted market value to approximately $12 billion.


After Ethereum founder Vitalik Buterin claimed $1.07 million worth of STRK tokens yesterday, the STRK price dropped approximately 6%.

Wizard Pepe (WIZPEPE) Will Skyrocket 18,000% as KuCoin Listing Announced



                    

Wizard Pepe (WIZPEPE) could turn early investors into multi-millionaires if it becomes a mainstream coin, like Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE).



Wizard Pepe (WIZPEPE), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is poised to explode over 18,000% in price in the coming days.




This is because WIZPEPE has announced its first centralized exchange listing, which will be on KuCoin.



This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up.



Currently, Wizard Pepe can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jupiter and Raydium, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days.




Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Wizard Pepe could become the next viral memecoin.



Wizard Pepe launched with over $6,000 of locked liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains.



To buy Wizard Pepe on Raydium or Jupiter ahead of the KuCoin listing, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Wizard Pepe by entering its contract address – AJM9tnhfGz9xezv1rTjspoTug3YVpcmrp3gJ9FMDEEYj – in the receiving field.



In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price.




If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner.



The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum.



This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like WIZPEPE.

$2.7 Billion in Bitcoin and Ether Options Set to Expire, Revealing Market Sentiment



                    

Approximately $2.7 billion in Bitcoin and Ether options are set to expire on May 24, offering key insights into market sentiment.



According to Greeks.live on X, 21,000 Bitcoin options are expiring, with a put/call ratio of 0.88. 




This shows a near-even balance between buyers and sellers, with a slight lean towards call options. 



The maximum pain point, or the price at which most option buyers would incur losses, is $67,000, totaling a nominal value of $1.4 billion.



While the upcoming 21,000 contract expiry is significant, it is overshadowed by a larger event on May 31, when $4.3 billion worth of options are set to expire, according to Deribit. 



Deribit data shows that long positions dominate open interest (OI), with $830 million tied to the $70,000 strike price. 



Higher strike prices also show significant OI, notably $843 million at the $100,000 mark, indicating a bullish sentiment among traders. 



The $60,000 strike price stands out with $388 million in open interest, the most notable for put contracts.



This substantial OI suggests many contracts remain unsettled, showing that bulls are confident in much higher Bitcoin prices.

OI represents the unresolved value of contracts awaiting settlement.




The options expiry event also impacts Ether, with 350,000 contracts expiring, representing a notional value of $1.3 billion. 



The put/call ratio of 0.58 and a max pain point of $3,200 suggest a slightly bullish tone, with more call options expiring than put options.



Greeks.live reports that Ethereum recently led the crypto rally, driven by ETF progress, with a one-day 20% rise. 



The short-term options implied volatility (IV) reached 150%, much higher than Bitcoin’s current IV for the same period.



However, a divergence between Bitcoin and Ethereum is evident. 



While Ethereum’s bullish sentiment remains strong, maintaining high IV levels for each major term is challenging from a market trading and structure perspective. 



This suggests that calendar spreads might be a better choice. In contrast, Bitcoin appears more balanced between long and short positions, with stronger forces selling calls.

Terra LUNA’s LUNC Set To Jump 13x, Analyst Reveals The Drivers


																Crypto analyst Javon Marks has laid out a bullish narrative for Terra Classic (LUNC). Based on his analysis, the crypto token could eventually see a 13x increase from its current price levels. The analyst alluded to LUNC’s historical pattern as what could drive such parabolic price surge.

How LUNC’s Price Could Jump By 1,300% 
Marks mentioned in an X (formerly Twitter) post that LUNC has confirmed a “major bullish pattern,” signaling a continuation of its bullish run to the first price target at $0.00058046. He noted that this move of over 400% was likely to be attained with the crypto token holding above levels that it had earlier broken out from. 

The crypto analyst then raised the possibility of LUNC making a 1,300% move instead. He claimed that LUNC’s previous breakout and run pattern suggests that three targets could be broken above, meaning that the crypto token rising to the price target of $0.00139122 from here is “possible.”
Marks has remained bullish on LUNC for a while now and has suggested that LUNC’s parabolic rally is a question of when and not if. However, he has failed to provide any specific timeframe for when this move will likely occur. LUNC’s fundamentals are also expected to contribute to this upward trend and push its price to such heights. 
One way that is likely to happen is through the LUNC’s burns, which are carried out regularly. The Terra community has burnt over 113 billion LUNC tokens since the burning initiative came into place following Terra LUNA’s crash in 2022. This has helped reduce the crypto tokens’s circulating supply and could be significant as demand for the token picks up. 
It is worth noting that LUNC is well below its all-time high of $119. However, this suggests that the crypto token has enough room to move significantly to the upside.

Recent Developments In The Terra Classic Ecosystem
Genuine Labs, a Terra Classic developer group, recently announced that the latest version of SDK 47 was ready. The proposed upgrade is expected to be put up for governance voting. The upgrade will introduce significant changes to the Terra network, including a fix to the dyncomm decorator. 
Furthermore, the upgrade will handle peer-to-peer (p2p) storms on the network and add new features to the Terrad client, which connects developers to the Terra blockchain. It is uncertain when the proposal will go live, but it should be soon enough.

Meanwhile, the Terra community also recently passed a proposal to make Allnodes an official organization for the community. Allnodes will be the official source for information regarding the circulating supply of LUNC, USTC, and other native tokens. 
At the time of writing, LUNC is trading at around $0.0001151, up over 2% in the last 24 hours, according to data from CoinMarketCap.

Here's Ethereum's Next Major Upgrade's Date and What It Will Bring - Bitcoin Sistemi


Ethereum main developers are targeting the release of Pectra, the next major update for the Ethereum network, by the end of the first quarter of 2025.
The Pectra update is expected to include the EVM Object Format (EOF), a collection of approximately 11 Ethereum Improvement Proposals (EIPs) that provide an optional container for EVM code. This key component is one of the main reasons for the projected 2025 timeline for the update.


Another key feature of the update is PeerDAS, a data availability sampling solution that leverages existing peer-to-peer (P2P) components in Ethereum.

In a notable development, the developers have agreed to replace the EIP-3074 account abstraction feature with EIP-7702, a newer offering from Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin. EIP-7702 will increase the flexibility and functionality of the network by allowing Externally Owned Accounts (EOA) to function as smart contract wallets during a transaction.





The Pectra update includes the Prague update in the Execution Layer and the Electra update in the Consensus Layer. However, the final scope of the upgrade is still being debated and there are potential changes on the horizon. One of these changes may be to postpone the transition to the Verkle tree until the next Osaka hardfork.

XRP's unusual token activity - Assessing its potential market impact - AMBCrypto



Many long-term XRP holders changed addresses, but it may not be in a bid to sell.
Short-term participants made mild gains, however, the token remained undervalued

In less than two weeks, XRP’s Age Consumed metric has resurrected from major lows three times. The first time was on 16 May when the metric spiked to 214.86 billion.
On 20 May, it went overboard and hit 539.79 billion, and on 24 May, the metric rose again, indicating significant movement of tokens by long-term holders.
For those unfamiliar, Age Consumed tracks the amount of tokens changing addresses within a certain period. When the metric spikes, it means that a large number of previously idle tokens are on the move.
On the other hand, a low reading suggests that long-term holders have kept most of their assets in the same wallet. On the back of the recent market surge, participants might assume that holders are planning to sell their XRP.
Source: Santiment
XRP to trade between $0.50 and $0.55
However, making conclusions without proof from other metrics might sound too hasty. As such, AMBCrypto evaluated the exchange inflows and outflows on the XRP Ledger.
According to data obtained from Santiment, XRP’s exchange inflows were 211,00. Exchange inflows measure the number of tokens sent from external wallets to exchange addresses.
A surge in the inflows suggests that most tokens might be up for sale. Furthermore, the exchange outflows at press time were 208,000. This metric is the number of tokens sent out to non-custodial wallets. On most occasions, this action implies that the participants involved do not plan to sell soon.
The mild difference in the flows indicates that XRP’s price might not be significantly affected by the spike in the movement of idle coins.
Source: Santiment
Holders should prepare for fireworks
At the time of writing, XRP’s price was $0.53. This value represented a 2.67% hike in the last 7 days. Going by the indications on-chain, XRP might not register a notable uptick in the coming days.
However, if the market condition gets too bearish, the price might slide to the $0.50 underlying support. Conversely, in a highly bullish scenario, XRP might hit $0.55 on the charts.
All in all, the short-term forecast seemed to indicate that the token might remain in a tight trading range. In the meantime, the Market Value to Realized Value (MVRV) ratio showed that more XRP holders have become profitable of late.
At press time, the 30-day MVRV ratio was 2.696%. This means that the average token holder who accumulated in the last 30 days might get positive returns if they sold.
Source: Santiment
In addition, the metric measures if an asset is undervalued or overvalued. By the look of things, XRP seemed to be undervalued, compared to its performance in March.

Read Ripple’s [XRP] Price Prediction 2024-2025

Hence, the token’s price might climb toward $0.60 in the mid-term. However, the short-term outlook does not exactly look bullish as XRP might swing sideways as mentioned previously.

South Korea Busts Crypto Scam: 19 Arrested In 'Reading Room' Fraud


								South Korean law enforcement has struck a blow against social media-fueled crypto scam with the arrest of 19 individuals linked to a deceptive “crypto reading room.” The Daegu Police Agency’s raid, which unfolded on May 21st, exposed a manipulative scheme that preyed on more than 300 unsuspecting investors, swindling them out of a staggering $19 million.

Crypto Scam: Deceptive Chats, Illusory Profits
Authorities allege the international gang operated an “open chat room,” likely on platforms like Telegram or KakaoTalk, masquerading as a legitimate hub for cryptocurrency trading advice.
Police describe the room as a meticulously crafted stage. Gang members, posing as seasoned crypto experts, dispensed seemingly valuable tips and boasted about substantial returns.
Others, acting as ordinary investors, chimed in with enthusiastic endorsements, weaving a web of trust to lure victims into the trap.

Bogus Exchanges, Brutal Betrayal
The meticulously crafted facade unraveled when victims were steered towards downloading apps connected to bogus crypto exchanges. These fake platforms, say officers, housed unlisted coins, further fueling the illusion of exclusivity and potential profit.

As of today, the market cap of cryptocurrencies stood at $2.5 trillion. Chart: TradingView.com
To solidify trust, the crypto scam gang allowed victims to make small, initial gains, emboldening them to invest larger sums. The true horror unfolded when victims attempted to withdraw their funds. They were met with a seemingly insurmountable obstacle – fabricated “withdrawal fees.”
Refusal to pay these fees resulted in the gang severing all communication, leaving victims with nothing but empty promises and stolen savings.
Pig-Butchering Abroad: A Chilling Twist
The investigation revealed a particularly disturbing recruitment tactic employed by the ringleader. Dubbed “pig-butchering,” it involved promising unsuspecting individuals lucrative job opportunities in Myanmar.
Upon arrival, a sinister bait-and-switch unfolded. Passports and phones were confiscated, and victims were strong-armed into joining the fraudulent operation. This tactic highlights the international reach of these criminal networks and the lengths they go to exploit vulnerabilities.

Crypto Wild West: A Call for Regulation
This raid underscores the urgent need for stricter regulations in the cryptocurrency space. South Korea, a hotbed for crypto activity, has seen a surge in social media-driven scams.
Experts believe this case may be a catalyst for the government to implement stricter controls on both crypto platforms and social media groups offering investment advice.

ChatGPT-4o predicts XRP's price if the token's ETF is approved


    Following the approval of spot Ethereum (ETH) exchange-traded funds (ETFs), Standard Chartered Bank has projected that several other cryptocurrencies could follow suit.



Among the cryptocurrencies is Ripple’s XRP, which is currently embroiled in a legal battle with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Notably, the approval of Ethereum spot ETFs suggests that the regulatory agency does not classify ETH as a security.



Therefore, this implies that other coins previously under scrutiny may also not be considered securities, paving the way for more spot crypto ETF approvals. 







Drawing from historical performance, the approval of the spot Bitcoin ETF led to the cryptocurrency rallying to a new record high. Monitoring whether the same can be replicated for XRP will be a matter of interest.



To gather insights regarding the price impact of a possible ETF on XRP, Finbold turned to OpenAI’s latest and most advanced artificial intelligence (AI) tool, ChatGPT-4o.



Implication of XRP spot ETF



The tool identified several factors around an ETF that could impact the price of XRP. First, ChatGPT-4o drew parallels from the past, noting that the approval of Bitcoin (BTC) ETFs significantly influenced the maiden cryptocurrency’s value. This surge has been attributed to heightened accessibility and institutional interest. Similarly, should an XRP ETF gain approval, a comparable uptrend could be anticipated.



The tool also noted that the regulatory move could positively impact XRP. It pointed out that if an XRP ETF receives the green light, heightened interest and investment from retail and institutional sectors could be witnessed, further bolstering XRP’s market position.



Additionally, the AI platform highlighted that the impact of the ETF approval could complement XRP’s existing fundamentals. It noted that XRP’s utility in cross-border payments and established partnerships with financial institutions underpin its intrinsic value.



XRP price prediction post-ETF approval



Regarding the token’s price, ChatGPT-4o suggested that XRP could experience a substantial price escalation if the ETF is approved. The tool offered a conservative estimate, stating that if ETF approval leads to moderate increases in investment and interest, XRP might see a price increase of 2x to 3x over the next year from the current valuation. This would place XRP in the range of $1.08 to $1.62.



In a more optimistic scenario, where market conditions are favorable and investor interest surges, XRP could see a 5x to 7x increase, leading to a price range of $2.70 to $3.78.



Elsewhere, in the event of a highly bullish market with significant institutional adoption and broader market rallies, the tool projected that XRP might experience a 10x increase, pushing the price to around $5.40 or higher.

It will be interesting to monitor how the SEC approaches a possible XRP ETF, considering the regulatory agency has been in a long-term legal battle with XRP’s parent company, Ripple. 



Overall, an approval would be considered bullish for the United States cryptocurrency landscape over the ability to attract institutional investor capital into the sector.



At the moment, there are expectations that the legal matter will be resolved soon. Ripple’s Chief Executive Officer, Brad Garlinghouse, continues criticizing the SEC over its “regulation by enforcement” approach.



XRP price analysis



By press time, XRP was trading at $0.53, having rallied about 0.3% in the last 24 hours. On the weekly timeframe, XRP is up almost 3%.

Meanwhile, XRP’s main hurdle is reclaiming the $1 mark, which is pivotal for competing with assets such as Bitcoin. In the short term, investors will be monitoring the price as it aims to breach the $0.60 resistance.

Telegram's Explosive Gaming Trend Spurs Cryptocurrency Adoption with Viral Hits like Notcoin



                    

Telegram‘s vast user base is becoming fertile ground for cryptocurrency adoption, with viral games like Notcoin surging in popularity.



In less than two months, Notcoin attracted over 30 million users on Telegram and established The Open Network (TON)-based cryptocurrency wallets. 




This “idle game,” where users tap their screens to earn NOT tokens, has integrated 3% of Telegram users into the Web3 space. 



Listing NOT tokens on major cryptocurrency exchanges has also provided financial benefits for casual gamers.



Inal Kardan, gaming lead at TON Foundation, discussed with Cointelegraph the unique ability of blockchain gaming to draw new users into the cryptocurrency ecosystem. 




“Gaining 35 million users in five months, Notcoin showed us how games can work on Telegram and how easy it can be to onboard users,” Kardan said at the Next Block Expo in Warsaw.



Kardan noted that several Telegram-based games are quickly attracting significant user numbers and revenues by leveraging marketing mechanics like sharing and mining within Telegram. 



He described Telegram as an accessible and “somewhat untapped distribution channel” that integrates Web2 technologies with web page extensions and blockchain functionality.



Kardan also mentioned a shift from the “play-to-earn” models of popular Web3 games like Axie Infinity. 




Games like Notcoin are adopting newer approaches, including traditional monetization tactics like advertising.



Yat Siu, co-founder of blockchain gaming venture capital firm Animoca Brands, explained that the success of Web3 games on Telegram and TON is due to viral growth mechanics previously used on platforms like Facebook or the Apple App Store. 



“Neither Apple nor Google have been as flexible on Web3 games on their platforms the way TON and Telegram have been. It’s a competitive builder/growth advantage that TON is getting here too,” Siu said.



Siu emphasized that idle clicker games have always been popular, but the user engagement approach of games like Notcoin is a key differentiator.

“The Notcoin approach has far better value for end-users and is more aligned with growth incentives versus the adversarial nature of Web2 advertising business models,” he added.



Siu cited Gamee, a Web3 gaming firm using hyper-casual games on TON and Telegram, as an example. 



Gamee’s average daily active user count has increased to around one million due to staking and idle game mechanics.



Michał Dąbrowski, CEO and founder of blockchain game infrastructure provider Elympics, believes Web3 games are set to attract new cryptocurrency users. 



Dąbrowski told Cointelegraph that blockchain infrastructure bridges the gap for game developers struggling with monetization mechanics, allowing them to use cryptocurrency wallets to incentivize and engage players.



Elympics sees immense potential in the TON ecosystem, which is closely linked to Telegram’s large user base. “Notcoin is a prime example. 



It tapped into the viral aspect of a social platform like Telegram. Sharing is an important part of the mechanics,” Dąbrowski said. 



He added that Web3 functionality is revitalizing the idle gaming genre, giving users ownership and value from their gameplay through monetized soft currencies.

Spot Ethereum ETF Approval Could Send ETH to a New Record High, Says Bitwise CIO Matt Hougan - The Daily Hodl


								The chief investment officer of crypto fund manager Bitwise is predicting new all-time highs for Ethereum (ETH) if spot ETH exchange-traded funds (ETFs) are ultimately approved.
Earlier this week, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) approved a rule change that sets the stage for the potential green lighting of spot market Ethereum ETFs.










In a new interview on the Bankless podcast, Matt Hougan predicts investor inflows into ETH ETFs would total billions of dollars and drive ETH beyond its all-time high of about $4,900, which it hit back in November 2021.
“I don’t think Ethereum ETFs will match Bitcoin ETFs. But I do think it will be measured in terms of many billions of dollars… 
Will it be enough to drive Ethereum to new all-time highs? I definitely think that’s possible as well. If Bitcoin ETFs did $12 billion in their first four months, I think Ethereum ETFs will do less than half of that but more than a quarter of that. And that’s going to be pretty significant. Remember, that’s against a market with no net new supply. So I think there is real demand.” 
Hougan believes that ETFs with exposure to multiple digital assets will also launch in the future and investor demand will exist for the different types.
“I think if you think about the ETF investor market if I had to put numbers on it a year from now, I think you’ll have 30% of the market that’s Bitcoin only, you’ll have like 50% of the market that’s a mix, you’ll have 20% of the market that’s ETH only… 
Many professional investors looking at the crypto market are looking for sort of tech alpha. They’re looking for that high-returning asset. Ethereum fits nicely into that dialogue. So I think you’ll see all three. And I think the market as a whole will benefit from there being multiple crypto asset ETFs if that’s what we get. It makes the market feel more robust, more real. There’s more to talk about. I think it’ll be a net positive. These are going to be significant.” 
Ethereum is trading for $3,736 at time of writing, down more than 1% in the last 24 hours.

Long squeeze alert: This cryptocurrency could crash 30% soon


    The meme coin mania is back in the cryptocurrency market, and cryptocurrencies like PEPE show signals of being overvalued. This could foreshadow a long squeeze, as suggested by increased open interest (OI), high funding rates, and accumulated liquidations downwards.



Previously, the meme coin boom marked a local top, followed by a market crash and significant long-position liquidations. Should a similar pattern play out, this asset class is at the peril of suffering another hit despite positive social activity from influencers.



As of this writing, PEPE has $736.69 million in open interest, ranking fifth on CoinGlass. This value represents 11% of the meme coin’s $6.39 billion market cap, trading at $0.0000151. Notably, PEPE’s OI is larger than the open interest on XRP, which has a $29.73 billion market cap.







Despite a drop of 37.82% in the $3.07 billion 24-hour volume, the market’s open interest is surging by 8.85% on the meme coin.

PEPE funding rates and potential long squeeze



In particular, the consolidated exchanges’ funding rates for PEPE indicate an open interest weighted to long positions. Currently, long-position traders pay an APR of 52.66% to PEPE short-sellers as a mechanism to remedy derivatives imbalances.



This high funding rate could accelerate a long squeeze to the meme coin or, at least, incentivize traders to close these bullish positions.

Moreover, the one-week liquidation heatmap shows a likely liquidation price target of $0.0000107 per token to leveraged PEPE traders. Therefore, the meme coin could be set for a long-squeeze crash if sentiment shifts from bullish to bearish.

A price drop to this target would result in 30% losses to traders buying PEPE at current levels.



Still, the meme coin could continue upward if enough capital flows into it in the following days. Cryptocurrency traders and speculators must understand the volatile nature of these digital assets and act cautiously moving forward.

Nvidia has 'near zero chance' of outperforming Bitcoin this decade, say experts


    In light of Nvidia’s (NASDAQ: NVDA) impressive performance over the past decade, financial and cryptocurrency experts now anticipate a significant shift, predicting that the tech giant has “near zero chance” of outperforming Bitcoin (BTC) in the upcoming decade. 



This forecast is part of a wider discussion on the evolving dynamics between traditional high-growth tech stocks like Nvidia and growing digital currencies such as Bitcoin.



Nvidia, a leader in the semiconductor industry, recently celebrated a remarkable milestone with its stock price soaring following the latest earnings report. 







This surge contributed to an overall return of 21,558% from May 2014 to May 2024, a growth significantly fueled by the company’s pioneering efforts in artificial intelligence (AI) and gaming technologies. 



An X post from The Kobeissi Letter on May 25 highlighted this extraordinary performance: 




“$NVDA has officially joined the exclusive club of 250,000%+ in all-time returns. $10,000 invested in Nvidia in 1999 is worth $25.3 million today.”




Despite these impressive gains, Bitcoin has emerged as a formidable competitor. It has returned 13,048% over the same period, with recent trends suggesting even greater potential.  



Notably, the 90-day correlation coefficient between Bitcoin and the Nasdaq 100 index rose to 0.46 last week, marking the highest level since late August. 



This reflects Bitcoin’s increasing alignment with mainstream financial markets, a trend further evidenced by its comparison with high-growth tech stocks.



Correlation index. Source: Bloomberg



Cory Klippsten, CEO of Swan Bitcoin, and Lyn Alden, a noted investment strategist, have expressed skepticism about Nvidia’s capacity to replicate its past decade’s success. 



They highlight Bitcoin’s advantages, such as its integration into mainstream financial products, including the recently approved Bitcoin ETFs, and its potential to outpace traditional assets due to its decentralized nature and extensive network effects.







Recent performance and market trends



The recent approval of spot Bitcoin ETFs on January 10 was a significant milestone that further legitimized Bitcoin as a mainstream investment option, boosting its returns to 31.7% since then. 



This slight edge over Nvidia’s 30.2% in the same period underscores growing investor confidence in Bitcoin, aligning it with the growth trajectories typically associated with high-growth tech stocks.



Daniel Sempere Pico and Sina from 21st.capital have commented on the potential for Bitcoin’s financial networks and widespread adoption to drive more sustainable long-term growth compared to Nvidia’s AI-driven advancements. 



They argue that while Nvidia’s innovations in AI are impactful, the broader applications of Bitcoin in global financial systems present a more compelling investment narrative, suggesting that the future of investment may tilt increasingly towards digital currencies over traditional tech giants.



Nvidia and BTC analysis: A comparative look at market performance



BTC and NVDA comparison. Source: TradingView



From January 1, 2024, to May 25, 2024, BTC-USD and NVIDIA demonstrated distinct trading patterns and growth trajectories, reflecting their unique market positions and investor sentiments.



Bitcoin exhibited significant volatility, with prices ranging from approximately $39,450 to $73,750, leading to a 63% YTD increase. 



This volatility, highlighted by frequent relative strength index (RSI) signals of overvaluation and undervaluation, underscores the speculative nature of Bitcoin, influenced by diverse investor behaviors and market dynamics.



In contrast, NVIDIA displayed strong growth, with its stock price increasing from $475 to $1,064, marking a YTD rise of about 115%. 



The stability in NVIDIA’s RSI suggests consistent market sentiment and fewer fluctuations attributed to its ongoing advancements in AI and the semiconductor sectors, which are vital for technological innovation and impact across various industries.



As Bitcoin increasingly competes with major tech stocks, its transformative role in the investment landscape is becoming more pronounced. 



With broader adoption and alignment with financial markets, digital currencies are poised to dominate future growth, potentially overshadowing even the most established tech giants

Ethereum ETFs Could Trigger ETH Supply Crisis


The newly approved spot Ethereum exchange-traded funds (ETFs) could trigger a supply crunch for the second-largest cryptocurrency by market cap.
Ethereum’s supply on centralized exchanges has hit an eight-year low, with only 12.78 million ETH available. This amount constitutes roughly 11% of the total supply.
Ethereum Demand Shock Expected

Analysts have noted that investors are withdrawing their ETH from exchanges just as the asset is poised to experience a surge in institutional demand. Such a decline in exchange balances is usually a bullish sign. It indicates that investors expect price growth and have no plans to sell their holdings in the short term.
This week, the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) approved several Ethereum ETFs, which many believe could boost demand for the cryptocurrency. 
Mara Schmiedt, CEO of Alluvial, points to the significant institutional interest generated by spot Bitcoin ETFs since their launch in January. These ETFs now hold 800,000 BTC, demonstrating a growing institutional appetite. Consequently, she predicts Ethereum could see similar demand, potentially leading to a significant demand shock.

“What happens if there is $20 billion taken out of the market? It could be a tipping point in terms of supply and demand. We haven’t really seen this kind of rapid demand shock in the market before,” Schmiedt said.

Notably, ETH is already experiencing a surge in institutional activity. Blockchain analytics platform IntoTheBlock reported that anticipation around Ethereum ETF approval pushed the on-chain trading volume to a two-year high of $15.98 billion, largely driven by crypto whales.

Of the $15.98 billion, $14.33 billion came from transactions exceeding $100,000, typically conducted by whales. This accounts for 90% of the total traded volume on that day.

IntoTheBlock explained that the approval of ETH ETFs marks a significant milestone in cryptocurrency acceptance. It continued that this move would likely increase ETH whales’ activity, as seen in recent large-volume transactions.

“The shifting landscape, underscored by substantial on-chain trading volumes, suggests a growing institutional and investor confidence in Ethereum. This trend is poised to gain momentum, potentially leading to even greater market movements,” IntoTheBlock added.

Here’s when Solana (SOL) could hit $1000


    Amid recent market volatility, Solana (SOL) demonstrates significant resilience and potential for growth, with predictions suggesting a path towards the $1,000 milestone. Despite a slight dip, innovative developments within its ecosystem and positive analyst forecasts signal a robust future.



Currently, SOL is trading at $168.24, having increased by 0.17% over the last day and an impressive 13% over the past month. Ranked as the fifth-largest cryptocurrency with a market capitalization of about $75.71 billion, Solana is attracting significant interest from investors.



This is reflected in a notable increase in trading volume, suggesting that Solana is on a path to recovery and poised for further growth in a fluctuating market.







Analyst perspectives



Prominent crypto analyst Trader Tardigrade has identified bullish trends in Solana’s technical patterns, suggesting the price could soar to $1000. 







His optimism is fueled by the growth of SocialFi applications like SolChat within Solana’s ecosystem, which enable blockchain-based social interactions. This innovation not only revolutionizes communication but also significantly boosts Solana’s intrinsic value.



Adding depth to this optimistic forecast, Daniel Yan from Matrixport draws parallels between Solana and Ethereum (ETH)



He notes that Ethereum previously benefited from the approval of a Bitcoin ETF and suggests that Solana could experience similar gains if Ethereum ETFs are approved. 



Yan prefers Solana over Ethereum due to its less crowded market and higher potential for profits, making it an attractive option for investors seeking substantial returns. He emphasizes Solana’s unique attributes and strategic market position, arguing that these factors distinguish it in the rapidly evolving cryptocurrency and ETF landscape.



Altcoin Sherpa complements these views, highlighting the technical strengths of Solana and its strategic market positioning.



He points out that the recent price dip might set the stage for a short-term rally. According to Sherpa, the Relative Strength Index (RSI) for Solana, which had previously dipped, is now rebounding, indicating an increase in buying interest.



The anticipated introduction of Solana and XRP ETFs by 2025, as hinted at by Standard Chartered, adds another layer of optimism. 



This forecast not only suggests a growing institutional interest in Solana but also marks it as a candidate for widespread adoption and significant price appreciation



SOL price analysis



Solana is currently trading at $168.74, with RSI  at 50.31 indicating a neutral market stance. However, the RSI also suggests a weakening momentum, hinting at increasing selling pressure.

ETH ETF: One Reason Making It Magnet for Retail Revealed by Investor


Besides the obvious paramount importance for institutions, the approval of spot ETFs on major cryptocurrencies might bring a new cohort of retail investors to Web3, the top investor says. He draws parallels to the 2017 crypto run that introduced blockchain assets to the majority of modern cryptocurrency enthusiasts.Crypto retail holders will be excited by Ether spot ETF, veteran investor Arthur Cheong saysArthur Cheong, the CIO and co-founder of Asian VC firm DeFiance Capital, cannot imagine a situation when the retail community will not be excited by the approval of exchange-traded products on spot Ethereum (ETH). He shared the statement on X following the approval of 19b-4s (preliminary) forms for U.S. spot ETH ETFs. He recalls the 2017 situation when "normies" were attracted to cryptocurrency by the amazing narratives of Ethereum (ETH) and XRP. It was Ethereum (ETH) that motivated the majority of 2017 newcomers to start learning crypto and investing in digital assets.While the technology and Ethereum (ETH) itself witnessed significant changes in the last seven years, its status remains undisputed for the entire Web3 scene:Cant imagine retail wont get excited by ETH; the decentralized technology layer powering Web 3.0 economyCheong highlighted that over 70% of spot Bitcoin ETF positions are held by retail investors. As covered by U.Today previously, spot ETFs on Bitcoin (BTC) were green-lit in the U.S. in early January.His followers echoed such a position, adding that the operators of potential Ethereum spot ETFs will do their utmost to aggressively promote the new products amid the retail audience.Ethereum (ETH) price fails to reconquer $4,000As U.Today previously reported, on May 23, 2024, the U.S. SEC approved 19b-4s requests for Ether ETFs' launch. The most crucial S-1s forms are yet to be authorized by the regulator.The most interesting is yet to come for Ethereum ETF enthusiasts. The price of Ether demonstrated pale performance, unimpressed by the interim milestone.Immediately post-approval, the Ethereum (ETH) price dropped from $3,830 to $3,670.

Dogecoin Price Pops And Drops Following Elon Musk’s Tribute To Meme Legend Kabosu ⋆ ZyCrypto

&nbsp

&nbsp
The price of Dogecoin (DOGE) spiked today after the meme coin’s most prominent evangelist, Elon Musk, tweeted about the passing of Kabosu — the Shiba Inu pup whose quizzical expression became synonymous with Dogecoin and the wider meme culture.



Elon Musk Mourns Internet Sensation Kabosu



As ZyCrypto reported earlier, Kabosu passed away on May 24 at age 18. Her owner, Atsuko Sato, revealed in a blog post that the internet-famous Shiba Inu dog had “crossed the rainbow bridge” peacefully. The Shiba Inu dog not only served as a mascot for Dogecoin, Shiba Inu, and countless other dog-themed cryptocurrencies but also became a symbol of the fun and cheerful spirit of the cryptoverse.



Tesla/SpaceX CEO Elon Musk paid tribute to Kabosu in a post on his X social media platform. The eccentric technopreneur shared a picture showing the Harambe gorilla with angel wings hugging the beloved dog among clouds that radiate an ethereal radiance, as can be seen here.







Harambe, the lowland gorilla, was killed in 2016 at the Cincinnati Zoo after he grabbed and dragged a little boy who climbed into his enclosure. Harambe also quickly inspired memes and an online movement after his death.



Bullish DOGE Reaction



DOGE rocketed as much as 7.7% to an intraday high of $0.17 in the span of minutes after Musk’s tribute post. The OG meme coin had pared some of its gains at press time, to change hands at $0.1649.

&nbsp



The rollercoaster price action spotlights the market-moving power Musk has over DOGE. In March, for instance, the DOGE price surged after the self-proclaimed Dogefather suggested that Tesla would, in the future, allow customers to purchase its electric vehicles with the leading meme coin. DOGE fans have also speculated on the possibility of Musk incorporating the token into an X payment system following his positive comments on various occasions.



Launched in December 2013 as a mere joke, Dogecoin remains the oldest and largest meme coin, with a market capitalization of $24.2 billion. But despite the latest price gains, Dogecoin remains down 77.5% from its historic peak of $0.73 set in May 2021.

ETH, SHIB, & USDT Among Most Common Altcoins Held By Mollars Presale Investors


                        
                            ETH, SHIB, & USDT Among Most Common Altcoins Held By Mollars Presale Investors                        
                        

                        The team behind the Mollars token presale & project have just released an interesting report via their official X profile. It had already been reported that the “MOLLARS” brand is seeing search volumes from crypto traders that are rivaling Bonk Inu (BONK) and Pepe (PEPE) tokens. Now data from an investor of the new store-of-value token is offering a look into what type of crypto traders are buying into Mollars presale.“Mollars ICO appears to be gaining the most momentum from these 10 cryptocurrency holders,” reads the tweet.Most Common Cryptocurrencies Held by Mollars Investors
The notice of analytical data was followed by the following list in descending order of rankings of which cryptocurrency holders have been seen buying Mollars. The common altcoins held include: 
Ethereum (ETH) 
Shiba Inu (SHIB) 
Tether (USDT) 
Bitcoin (BTC) 
Dogecoin (DOGE)
Bonk Inu (BONK) 
Pepe Token (PEPE) 
Floki Inu (FLOKI)
DogWifHat (WIF)
Polygon (MATIC)
Though this data has not yet been verified, the transaction wallets of the Mollars token presale are visible to the general public (1, 2, and the prior ETH address 3).In a brief review of the latest Ethereum transaction address, it’s clear that many of these tokens are held by traders along with Wrapped Ethereum (wETH).With Mollars becoming such a popular cryptocurrency brand amongst other majors, this data could further strengthen the case that the new store-of-value asset will have an explosive ride to the 9 figure market capitalization milestone.Cryptocurrency Brand ValueGoogle Trends also shows that the “Mollars” keyword has enough search volume to be picked up as a popular inquiry. Using the comparison tool, traders can view that “Mollars” is searched for 50% as much as ‘Pepe token’ on some days and 90% as much as ‘Bonk Inu.’ BONK token holders are also credited with being the mob of new investors that invested in Mollars presale from the previous week. The migratory horde possibly invested nearly 6 figures into the ICO event cumulatively.Mollars Initial Coin Offering will end on June 2nd. With it currently pre-selling at a price of $0.55-cents, this may be the last time it’s available to investors at a price that’s under what it’s listed to debut at on cryptocurrency exchanges — $0.62.Also, Ethereum-Blockchain’s new store-of-value asset will have less than half of the total token supply Bitcoin. The $BTC is the top rival of $MOLLARS, but the original cryptocurrency has outdated and what some consider an unscalable blockchain technology. With the Ethereum Spot ETF approval just passing, some believe that ERC-20 tokens could possibly see a bigger increase in value than Bitcoin this year.To date, the Mollars ICO has raised over $1.4-million dollars and continues to generate 5-figures (USD) daily in token presales.

Vitalik Buterin Backs Private Likes and Proposes Zero-Knowledge Technology for Social Media



                    

Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin expressed his support for X engineer Haofei’s announcement on the decentralized social media platform Farcaster, where Haofei revealed that X will make “Likes” private.



On May 20, Buterin expanded on this idea, suggesting that Farcaster should implement zero-knowledge (ZK) likes to address preference falsification—misrepresenting true preferences due to social pressure or fear.




Zero-knowledge technology is a privacy-preserving cryptography method that enables one party to prove a statement’s truth to another without revealing confidential information. 



Applied to likes, it would allow someone to prove they liked a post without revealing their identity.



Buterin proposed borrowing ZK technology from Zupoll, a tool used within the pop-up city concept he initiated, Zuzalu. Zupoll, focused on decentralization and cryptography, is utilized for anonymous voting and poll decision-making.




Buterin’s suggestion to use ZK technology aligns with Farcaster’s principles: user privacy, censorship resistance, autonomy, and differentiation from centralized social media platforms.



In response to rumors that X might hide users’ likes by default, Haofei confirmed that the platform would make likes private, explaining:

“Public likes are incentivizing the wrong behavior. For example, many people feel discouraged from liking content that might be ‘edgy’ in fear of retaliation from trolls, or to protect their public image.” 




Haofei added that users would soon be able to like posts “without worrying who might see it,” and emphasized that “the more posts you like, the better for you the algorithm will become.”



Community reactions were mixed. Some users suggested extending the idea to other features, stating, “Why stop at likes? Following is the same.” 



In contrast, high-profile accounts like Wall Street Silver offered differing opinions.



Beyond ZK cryptography, Buterin has proposed solutions to mitigate the miner extracted value (MEV) issue. 



MEV strategies allow validators to profit by arranging transactions within a block to exploit arbitrage opportunities. 



However, this practice congests the network, increases trader slippage, and raises gas fees. 



To address this, Buterin recommended MEV minimization quarantine techniques, the use of inclusion lists, and reduced requirements to run a node.

New Solana Memecoin Junkyard Cat (JUNKCAT) to Skyrocket 14,000% as KuCoin Listing Announced, While Shiba Inu and Dogecoin Struggle



                    

Junkyard Cat (JUNKCAT) could turn early investors into multi-millionaires if it becomes a mainstream coin, like Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE).



Junkyard Cat (JUNKCAT), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is poised to explode over 14,000% in price in the coming days.




This is because JUNKCAT has announced its first centralized exchange listing, which will be on KuCoin.



This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up.



Currently, Junkyard Cat can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jupiter and Raydium, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days.




Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Junkyard Cat could become the next viral memecoin.



Junkyard Cat launched with over $6,000 of locked liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains.



To buy Junkyard Cat on Raydium or Jupiter ahead of the KuCoin listing, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Junkyard Cat by entering its contract address – 6AdCuXXoxVMzPnczLjgqC9nQSBtcXnffVvRs8JsQvHhM – in the receiving field.



In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price.




If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner.



The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum.



This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like JUNKCAT.

Prosecutors Seek Up to 7 Years for Former FTX Executive Ryan Salame in Crypto Fraud Case



                    

U.S. prosecutors are seeking a five to seven-year prison sentence for former FTX executive Ryan Salame, who was allegedly a key accomplice to FTX co-founder Sam “SBF” Bankman-Fried, in connection with the collapse of the FTX crypto exchange.



On May 21, federal prosecutors submitted a sentencing memo to a Manhattan federal court, calling for a strict sentence for Salame, who has pleaded guilty to serious crimes related to the misuse of FTX investors’ funds.




According to a court filing viewed by Bloomberg, the prosecutors are advocating for a “just punishment” that reflects the severity of Salame’s crimes, contrary to his lawyers’ recommendation of no more than 18 months in prison.



“The campaign finance offense is one of the largest-ever in American history, and the unlicensed money transmitting business exchanged more than $1 billion without proper supervision,” said the prosecutors.



Salame’s sentencing, for aiding SBF in misappropriating $10 billion of users’ funds, is scheduled for May 28.




The prosecutors emphasized, “Only a meaningful period of incarceration could adequately deter the defendant and others and promote respect for the law.”



READ MORE: Bitcoin Hovers Near $67,000 as Traders Eye Key Resistance and Support Levels



On April 1, the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York sentenced SBF to 25 years in prison after he was convicted on seven felony charges. 



Salame is set to be the first of SBF’s accomplices to be sentenced.




Salame joined Alameda Research in Hong Kong in 2019 and eventually became the CEO of FTX Digital Markets, the Bahamas-based subsidiary of FTX.



Other notable figures involved in the FTX scheme, including Caroline Ellison, Nishad Singh, and Gary Wang, have yet to be sentenced.



Meanwhile, several U.S. lawmakers are backing a bill intended to clarify the roles of financial regulators in the oversight of digital assets, aiming to prevent future incidents similar to FTX. 



North Carolina Representative Wiley Nickel has called for the passage of the Financial Innovation and Technology for the 21st Century (FIT21) Act, which would define how the Securities and Exchange Commission and Commodity Futures Trading Commission regulate cryptocurrencies.

FTX Paid More Than $25,000,000 in Hush Money to Whistleblowers, According to Court Examiner - The Daily Hodl


								The bankrupt crypto exchange FTX paid more than $25 million worth of hush money to whistleblowers before collapsing in November 2022, according to a new report from a court-appointed examiner.
Earlier this year, the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) tapped Robert J. Cleary, a lawyer who served as the lead prosecutor on the Unabomber case, to probe FTX as part of the exchange’s ongoing bankruptcy case.










In a report filed on Thursday, Cleary references an investigation conducted by Quinn Emanuel Urquhart & Sullivan, a white-shoe law firm hired by FTX chief executive John J. Ray III, who took over for disgraced former CEO Sam Bankman-Fried.
Quinn Emanuel probed how FTX handled several whistleblower complaints that alleged systemic misconduct at the company.
The law firm concluded that FTX failed to properly investigate the substance of the whistleblowers’ complaints but did pay out more than $25 million to seven people who raised issues. Bankman-Fried’s father, Stanford Law School professor Joseph Bankman, reportedly helped resolve some of the complaints.
The whistleblowers alleged that FTX and its associated entities misled investors, commingled customer funds, violated commodity regulations, committed market manipulation and insider trading and failed to install appropriate anti-money laundering controls and compliance measures, among other issues.
FTX imploded and filed for bankruptcy in November 2022 amid accusations that Bankman-Fried mishandled the exchange’s funds by loaning out billions of dollars worth of customer deposits to Alameda Research, the firm’s trading arm.
The exchange’s multi-billion dollar collapse led to a sharp downtick in crypto prices, and US federal authorities arrested Bankman-Fried the following month.
Last November, a US jury found the former FTX chief executive guilty of wire fraud and conspiracy to commit wire fraud against FTX’s customers, wire fraud and conspiracy to commit wire fraud against Alameda’s lenders, conspiracy to commit securities fraud against FTX’s investors, conspiracy to commit commodities fraud against FTX’s customers and conspiracy to commit money laundering.
In March, Judge Lewis A. Kaplan sentenced Bankman-Fried to 25 years in prison and three years of supervised release. He also ordered the 32-year-old to pay $11 billion in forfeiture. Bankman-Fried is appealing his conviction and sentence.

This Solana Presale Has Raised Over $2.5M - Could it be the Next BOME?


This article was paid for*
The Solana meme coin circuit is deeply entrenched within 2024’s crypto bull rally, and a new presale is vying for the center stage after raising over $2.5 million so far.
Following the blueprint by Solana sensation Book of Meme, the newly launched Sealana is set to take the market by storm.
BOME made millionaires, but Sealana has exceeded its presale success
For those interested in meme coin culture, Book of Meme is one of 2024’s most iconic cryptocurrencies.
After rising from nothingness, the presale shocked the market by becoming the fastest cryptocurrency to reach a $1 billion market cap.

Initially launching as a presale, investors had the chance to buy in before the token launched on exchanges. 
The biggest BOME presale investor spent $72K, and many others made 4- and 5-figure purchases.
However, nobody was expecting the life-changing returns that followed.
While BOME began as an unassuming meme coin presale, its exchange launch ignited astronomical success. BOME exploded and became the fastest cryptocurrency to reach a $1 billion market cap.
The project also secured a Binance listing within two days of launching.
And those presale investors? Well, they made generational wealth.
Blockchain analytics account LookOnChain reported how the biggest BOME presale investor, sundayfunday.sol, turned $72K into over $30 million in just three days.

Indeed, this was not the only investor to garner absurd gains from the Book of Meme presale. The presale raised over $2 million, so it is apparent that many traders got rich from BOME.
However, with BOME market cap at a tidy $873 million today, the time to make outsized gains has passed, and traders are scouring for the next big Solana meme coin.
Enter Sealana. 
Not only has Sealana outperformed Book of Meme’s presale total raise, with over $2.5 million already in the bag, but the project is being embraced for its cultural references and relatability to Solana meme coin degens.
Sealana’s South Park-esque chronicles make it unlike any other meme coin
Inspired by South Park, Sealana features a hilarious backstory and unapologetic social media content, causing a buzz among degen Solana traders.
With the Solana blockchain known as crypto’s Wild West, Sealana’s foul-mouthed antics fit right in.

Meanwhile, its website provides some background on Sealana, explaining that he is a seal who lives in his mom’s basement, trading meme coins and living off canned tuna and chips. He is pursuing meme coin riches and hopes to buy a new Lambo one day.
Solana traders live and breathe this rags-to-riches mentality, so it is no wonder that the presale is so popular.
The project’s witty narrative has also caught the eye of leading analysts, with Jacob Bury speculating it could 10x after launching on exchanges.

Adding to the excitement, the broader Solana ecosystem is gearing for a massive boost, with TradFi players set to move in.
The potential Solana ETFs is good news for Sealana  
After the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) gave the green light to Ethereum spot ETFs this week, the forward-looking market immediately began speculating on the next big crypto narrative.
The launch of ETH ETFs opens the floodgates to new altcoin ETFs, and analysts from CNBC suggest that Solana could be next in line.
Market commentator Symbiote commented that Solana ecosystem plays could skyrocket as a result.

Given Sealana’s accelerating momentum, this could prove massively beneficial for the seal-themed meme coin.
But while the future looks bright for Sealana, the team has not announced a hard cap, so the presale could end anytime.
As such, potential investors should act fast to avoid missing out.

This Altcoin Ignored the SEC's Warning: Voting Begins to Distribute Fees to Token Holders - Bitcoin Sistemi


Despite receiving a warning from the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), Uniswap Foundation is continuing with its plans. The foundation announced on May 31 that it will conduct on-chain voting and prepare the infrastructure for autonomous fee collection and distribution.
The on-chain voting, which will go live next Friday, is part of a proposal that would require additional voting to activate fees on Uniswap V3 pools. UNI token holders who wish to participate in this voting are advised to delegate their cryptocurrencies before the specified date.



Authored by Uniswap Foundation leader Erin Koen, the proposal proposes an upgrade that would reward UNI token holders who stake their tokens and delegate their staked tokens. These people will be able to receive some of the fee income of the protocol. According to data, the protocol has collected a staggering $3.3 billion in fees since its inception.
The foundation also proposes a new mechanism for future voting. This mechanism aims to make fee adjustments more dynamic, reduce the burden on Uniswap Management and maintain the reliable neutrality of the protocol.

YouTube Sleuth Coffeezilla Exposes Rabbit AI's Alleged $6M NFT Scam and Overhyped Products



                    

YouTube investigator Stephen Findeisen, better known as “Coffeezilla,” has accused the AI company Rabbit of orchestrating an NFT scam and attempting to cover it up.



On May 21, Findeisen published a video on his Coffeezilla channel, revealing Rabbit AI’s involvement in NFTs. 




He pointed out that the company, previously called Cyber Manufacture Co., had raised $6 million for an NFT project called Gama.



Years later, Rabbit AI’s founder and CEO, Jesse Lyu, tried to distance the company from its crypto past. 



Findeisen highlighted Lyu’s statements on Discord, where Lyu asserted that the company would “never touch crypto” again.




Cointelegraph has reached out to Rabbit for comments.



Lyu explained that Gama was just a “fun little project” he participated in during the COVID-19 pandemic and that he left the project once the game was open-sourced. 



However, Findeisen unveiled recordings of Lyu discussing ambitious plans for the NFT project. In these recordings, Lyu talked about investing millions to make Gama “a next-level experience.”

He stated:“NFTs are only just the beginning […] After NFTs, we have these huge groundbreaking ideas about Gamaverse, and then after that, we have these again, huge, groundbreaking ideas about clean energy versus Gama Coin.”



Findeisen questioned where the $6 million raised for the Gama project went, given Lyu’s grand promises. 



According to Coffeezilla, the company claimed that the funds were solely used for the NFT project.



Despite this, Coffeezilla argued that Rabbit should still be scrutinized, as it is built on the remnants of the Gama project. He also criticized the company’s viral R1 product, stating:



“So many of the promises of Gama didn’t happen. 



“This is relevant to the R1 not just because this project is built on the skeleton of that scam project, it’s also because the R1 is overhyped in a similar way.”



In addition to Findeisen, others have criticized Rabbit’s R1 product as an “AI grift.” 



On January 14, WeGPT founder and CEO Josh Olin claimed on X that Rabbit’s project was a “scam.” 



Olin described the company’s product as a quick cash grab aimed at deceiving investors.

Bitcoin To Hit $1 Million In Next 10 To 18 Months, Says Crypto Analyst: 'We're Still So Early In The Bitcoin Story' - Benzinga

Jack Mallers, CEO of the Bitcoin wallet and payments app Strike, forecasts that Bitcoin BTC/USD could achieve a seven-figure valuation, potentially reaching up to $1 million.What Happened: In an interview with "The Pomp Podcast" host Anthony Pompliano, Mallers stated that Bitcoin's price could increase between 260% and 1,357% within the next 10 to 18 months.“I think we’re still so early in the Bitcoin story. I’m publicly on record saying I think Bitcoin will hit $250,000 to $1 million in this cycle. So now I’m speaking the next 10 to 18 months,” he said. Mallers believes the current price of Bitcoin, $68,653, is just the beginning. Mallers attributes this potential surge to the U.S. government's need to print more money to manage its $34.577 trillion debt.“I think people would be willing to pay $250,000 for a Bitcoin based on the mess that I think … I mean, there’s a massive hole and a loss that must be realized. That loss is going to come through debasing the currency. Asset prices are going to go up. What is the best asset and the best-performing asset? What’s the best money in human history? And so I think that has to be accurately priced,” Mallers added. Also Read: Crypto Analyst Foresees Upswing In Bitcoin's Value Before Major PlungeHe argued that this currency debasement will drive Bitcoin's value up significantly.Mallers also mentioned that the focus should not be on the cost of capital but on the amount of capital being printed despite interest rates being 5.5%. “People are too fixated on the cost of capital regarding rates. They need to be more fixated on the amount of capital, which is they’re still printing dollars. It doesn’t matter that rates are at 5.5% — it’s still inflationary," he said. Why It Matters: The prediction by Jack Mallers comes at a time when the cryptocurrency market is already experiencing significant bullish sentiments.Earlier this year, a crypto analyst predicted a 119% surge in Bitcoin, citing the promise of a spot ETF and the upcoming halving event. This analyst emphasized the increased visible demand for Bitcoin, which could further bolster its price.Additionally, another forecast projected a monumental Bitcoin rally by 2026. This long-term outlook aligns with Mallers' short-term prediction, suggesting a sustained upward trend for Bitcoin. Now Read: Latest Bitcoin Halving Could Cost Miners Billions Of Dollars In Revenue: ReportThis content was partially produced with the help of AI tools and was reviewed and published by Benzinga editors.Photo: Shutterstock

Solana Vs. XRP ETF: Expert Predicts Which One Will Be Approved First | Bitcoinist.com


								Recent developments with the Spot Ethereum ETFs have led to discussions about which crypto token could have its own ETF next. Solana (SOL) and XRP ETFs have taken center stage, with experts deliberating which one will come first. 
Expert Says A Solana ETF Is Next
Brian Kelly, founder of digital assets investment firm BKCM, mentioned during an interview on CNBC that Solana is probably the next crypto token to get its own ETF. He explained that Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Solana are the ‘Big 3’ for this cycle, making it likely that Solana is next since the two foremost crypto tokens already have their respective funds.

Bloomberg analyst James Seyffart also seemed to agree with Kelly, stating that he believes a SOL ETF see more demand than other digital assets besides Bitcoin and Ethereum. However, he claimed a SOL ETF would launch within a few years of getting a CFTC-regulated futures market. 
Seyffart added that Congress and market structure bills like the Financial Innovation and Technology for the 21st Century (FIT21) bill will speed up a SOL ETF launch. Congress’ intervention is necessary, considering the Commission has outrightly labeled Solana security in the lawsuit against Coinbase and Kraken. 
Seyffart noted that this security label could make the potential approval of a SOL ETF a “very rocky road.” This issue could be a stumbling block to several other crypto tokens since Bitcoin and Ethereum appear to be the only tokens the SEC doesn’t consider securities.
This seems to be why Ark Invest’s CEO Cathie Wood once predicted that there will only likely be Bitcoin and Ethereum Spot ETFs in the US. She added that it would be surprising to see “anything but Bitcoin and Ether being approved by the SEC,”
The Likelihood Of An XRP ETF
Market experts have also discussed the likelihood of an XRP launching soon. CoinShares’ head of product, Townsend Lansing, previously mentioned that the SEC must agree that XRP isn’t a security before an XRP ETF can launch. Van Buren Capital general partner Scott Johnsson remarked that the likelihood of the Commission approving this fund was “very slim.”

Seyffart has also discussed the possibility of an XRP ETF launching soon. Like what he said about a SOL ETF, he mentioned that XRP futures must be traded on a regulated exchange like the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME). Meanwhile, he believes that the SEC’s case against Ripple is another reason why XRP ETF cannot happen this year. 
The SEC’s case against Ripple seems to be another reason a SOL ETF could launch before an XRP ETF. However, Ripple’s CEO Brad Garlinghouse is confident that XRP will be among the crypto assets that will have its ETF when the SEC is ready to approve other crypto funds, noting that XRP and Bitcoin are the only crypto tokens with regulatory clarity.

Buy signal for 2 oversold cryptocurrencies this week


    As the cryptocurrency market begins to recover from a steep downturn, there is a noticeable shift in sentiment, with increasing momentum signaling a potential upswing.



Following a period marked by fear and significant sell-offs, the market is gradually trending upward, unveiling new opportunities for investors.



According to CoinGlass, the average Relative Strength Index (RSI) currently stands at 54.56. This level indicates more balanced trading conditions, suggesting that the market is neither overly bullish nor bearish.







Such stability provides fertile ground for identifying potential buying opportunities, particularly in assets that have recently dipped into oversold territories.



Utilizing the 24-hour RSI heatmap from CoinGlass’s momentum indicator, Finbold has identified these opportunities, highlighting assets that are now poised for recovery after hitting recent lows. 



TRON (TRX)



In this context, TRON (TRX) emerges as a noteworthy candidate for investment. Currently priced at $0.11349, TRX has recently experienced a slight decline of 0.97%. Its RSI readings across different time frames indicate that it has been significantly oversold.

Specifically, the RSI is at 29.54 for the 4-hour chart, 27.16 for the 12-hour, and 34.73 for the 24-hour. These indicators hint at a potential bottoming out, making TRX a prime candidate for a “buy the dip” strategy as the market sentiment begins to improve.



Bluzelle (BLZ) 



Similarly, Bluzelle (BLZ) presents an intriguing opportunity. Currently priced at $0.267 with a recent increase of 3.9%, BLZ is showing early signs of recovery. 



Crypto market RSI heatmap, BLZ. Source: CoinGlass



The RSI values for BLZ—39.01 for 4 hours, 33.1 for 12 hours, and 30.03 for 24 hours—suggest that it, too, is emerging from oversold conditions. This positioning indicates that BLZ might be starting to align with the broader market’s tentative recovery, potentially leading to substantial price corrections upward.



Nevertheless, having an oversold RSI status does not guarantee price recovery. Understanding this extreme-weakness indicator is vital for investors looking for buy signals. 



Cryptocurrencies are highly volatile assets, and everything can change in the blink of an eye.

Worldcoin Ordered to Halt Operations in Hong Kong After Privacy Law Violation



                    

Hong Kong’s Office of the Privacy Commissioner for Personal Data (PCPD) has concluded that the Worldcoin project violated the Personal Data (Privacy) Ordinance (PDPO) in Hong Kong.



On May 22, Privacy Commissioner Ada Chung Lai-ling issued an enforcement notice to Worldcoin, ordering an immediate halt to all operations in Hong Kong involving the scanning and collecting of iris and facial images using iris scanning devices.




The PCPD launched its investigation into Worldcoin in January 2024 to assess whether its identity verification methods posed significant risks to personal data privacy and contravened the PDPO. 



Between December 2023 and January 2024, the PCPD conducted ten covert visits to six premises involved in the Worldcoin project.



The PCPD found that collecting face images was unnecessary for verifying the humanness of participants since operators could perform this verification in person at the locations.




Thus, the collection of face images was deemed an unnecessary step.



Moreover, the PCPD highlighted that Worldcoin failed to provide adequate information, preventing participants from making informed decisions and giving genuine consent. 



The privacy notice was not available in Chinese, leaving non-English speaking participants unaware of the project’s policies, practices, terms, and conditions.

The PCPD stated:



“[…] the iris scanning device operators at the operating locations also did not offer any explanation or confirmed the participants’ understanding of the aforesaid documents.



They also did not inform the participants the possible risks pertaining to their disclosure of biometric data, nor answered their questions.”



The PCPD determined that under these conditions, the collection of face and iris images was unfair and unlawful, violating data protection principles. 



Furthermore, Worldcoin’s retention of sensitive biometric data for up to 10 years solely for AI model training, including face and iris images, was deemed unjustified.



Worldcoin confirmed that 8,302 individuals had their faces and irises scanned for verification during its operation in Hong Kong.



The project, announced in 2021, saw over two million people sign up before its official launch in July 2023. 



Worldcoin has faced regulatory scrutiny in many countries over privacy concerns, leading to the suspension of services in Kenya and the halting of iris scans in India.

China Sells $48,900,000,000 in US Treasuries in One Quarter, Analyst Says 'Clear Intention' To Dump US Dollar Holdings on Display - The Daily Hodl


								The world’s second-largest economy is steadily unloading billions of dollars in US Treasuries.
New data from the US Treasury Department shows China pared its Treasury holdings from $816.3 billion in December of last year to $767.4 billion in March.










That’s a quarterly decrease of $48.90 billion.
The chief Asia foreign-exchange and rates strategist at Bloomberg Intelligence, Stephen Chiu, says a clear trend is underway.
“As China is selling both despite the fact that we are closer to a Fed rate-cut cycle, there should be a clear intention of diversifying away from US dollar holdings.”
The drop in China’s ownership of US bonds comes as former International Monetary Fund (IMF) deputy director Desmond Lachman warns that a fresh trade war between the two largest economies is brewing.
In a post on the Washington-based think tank American Enterprise Institute, Lachman says that both President Biden and former President Trump are drumming up “punitive import tariffs” against China.
“In addition to a 100% import tariff on Chinese electrical vehicles, Biden announced that the U.S. will triple import tariffs on Chinese steel and aluminum, and double import tariffs on Chinese semiconductors and solar cells.
Not to be outdone, former President Donald Trump is indicating that if he is elected again as president, he will increase tariffs on Chinese electrical vehicles to 200% and will impose a 10% tariff on all U.S. imports.”
According to Lachman, the increased import tariffs will likely prompt China to retaliate, leading to an escalation that would hurt both nations. Should a full-blown trade war materialize, Lachman warns that it will add inflationary pressure in the US as Chinese companies increase prices to cover the additional costs of entering the US market.
“The Federal Reserve is already finding inflation unexpectedly resistant to its interest-rate increases. A new trade war would only further delay the start of a Fed rate-cutting cycle, depriving the country of a boost to growth.”

Fake Satoshi Nakamoto Defeated - Bitcoin Whitepaper is Back on the Website - Bitcoin Sistemi


The Bitcoin whitepaper has made a successful return to the Bitcoin.org website, marking the end of the legal process previously involving Craig Wright, who claimed to be BTC founder Satoshi Nakamoto.
In 2021, Wright's website was forced to remove the PDF version of the whitepaper after a lawsuit was filed against Cøbra, the anonymous group that runs the site, for copyright infringement. But Wright's victory was undermined by the complete debunking of his claims that he was Satoshi and, by extension, that he wrote the white paper.


The return of the Bitcoin whitepaper was announced by Bitcoin.org administrator Hennadii Stepanov, who shared a link to the PDF in question on the X platform.

Legal proceedings initiated by Wright required Cøbra to appear in court hearings threatening to expose his anonymity. As a result of Cøbra choosing not to attend these hearings, Wright won the case by default and Cøbra was ordered to pay £35,000 ($40,100) towards Wright's legal costs.





As a result of the case, Bitcoin.org was forced to stop making the Bitcoin whitepaper available to users in the UK. Despite these issues, numerous publishers have come together to share the Bitcoin whitepaper in a collective act of protest. The cryptocurrency division of Square, Jack Dorsey's company, and various governments, including the United States, Estonia and Colombia, published the document on their platforms.

Suspected Insider Whale Bought More Than Half Of This Altcoin's Total Supply - Bitcoin Sistemi


Data shared by cryptocurrency analysis company Lookonchain shows that an inside whale made a large purchase in a newly launched memecoin.
According to the data, the insider in question created a completely new cryptocurrency wallet and used the $230,000 Solana coin to purchase 63.2% of the total supply of the memecoin called CAT as soon as it was released.


Then, after the price of the token increased extremely rapidly, he sold some of his CAT tokens for $5 million.

On the other hand, another whale seems to have purchased a large amount of this token. A cryptocurrency wallet thought to belong to the market-making company Wintermute used $301,000 worth of Solana tokens to buy CAT tokens, and at the time of this writing, they have an unrealized profit of $886,000.





At the time of writing this article, CAT's total market value has reached up to 25 million dollars. However, memecoins are known to be extremely volatile and risky assets and do not have any intrinsic value other than the expectation of price growth.

TON's road to $10 - Toncoin holders should hope these updates pan out - AMBCrypto



Failure of TON holders to exit the market at $6.39 could spur a hike to $7.50
Network activity dropped, but external developments pointed to possible double-digit gains

21% of Toncoin’s [TON] holders are sitting at the same price where they purchased the token, indicating that they are at make or mark point right now. Additionally, further assessment of IntoTheBlock’s data revealed that 29% of all holders have accumulated TON over the last 30 days.
This ratio was more than those who bought the cryptocurrency one year ago. In the last 30 days, TON’s price has risen by 22.09%, meaning that some addresses that bought the token recently are now in profit.
However, the last seven days have not been palatable for Toncoin. This, because the price dropped by 1.91%. In light of the token’s performance this year, holders at the breakeven point might decide not to sell though.
The reason is that a chunk of them might be part of the 29% who purchased the token over the past month. Especially since as AMBCrypto has preciously reported, TON’s price has been on a good run this year.
Source: IntoTheBlock
Things are working in TON’s favor
As such, it is expected that the price could rise higher on the charts. With this forecast, it is possible that the $6.39-level, which was Toncoin’s price at press time, could act as support for the token.
If this is the case, and bears fail to neutralize the defense, TON could hike to $7.50. However, AMBCrypto is not the only party expecting this move.
Shiveen Moodley, a tokenomics researcher, also shared this projection. For Moodley, the focus was on the long-term prospect of the project using TON’s performance against other top cryptocurrencies.
Source: CryptoQuant
His opinion and the aforementioned aligned with AMBCrypto’s report about Toncoin’s correlation with Bitcoin [BTC] and Ethereum [ETH].
Will the price hit $10?
According to him, Toncoin’s supply, active userbase, and links with Telegram could help the token hit more upside. He noted in his analysis via CryptoQuant that,
“Currently, with a supply of 5 billion coins and an inflation rate of 2 percent, leading to an estimated 10 billion coins in 35 years steady price increases are likely in the long run.”
On 23 May, Telegram disclosed that it would release a digital currency for payments on its platform. Considering the social media platform’s links with Toncoin, there are speculations that the token might be involved.
If so, activity on the network, as well as demand for the token, might skyrocket. Should this be the case, it might only take a short period for TON to hit $10.
However, data from Santiment showed that activity on the Toncoin network had instead fallen. At press time, the 24-hour active addresses were down to 356 too.

This was around the same spot the metric was at before the price ran to $7.45 in May. While the token might not replicate the same move, a hike in network activity could set the stage for TON’s rally.
Before that, however, the price might swing between $5.90 and $6.40 on the charts.

Crypto Exchange Giant OKX To Pull Trading Services From Hong Kong at the End of the Month - The Daily Hodl


								The crypto exchange giant OKX will shutter its digital asset trading services in Hong Kong at the end of the month.
OKX says it decided to pull its application for a virtual asset trading platform license in Hong Kong “after careful consideration of the business development prospects.”










The exchange will stop providing trading services on May 31st, though its customers will still be able to make withdrawals. OKX’s web3 self-hosted wallet will also continue to provide services to customers.
OKX is one of ten crypto exchanges that have withdrawn their trading platform license applications in the special administrative region.
The Justin Sun-affiliated trading giant HTX also pulled its application in late February. The Seychelles-headquartered exchange reapplied shortly afterward but withdrew its application again earlier this month, according to a report from the South China Morning Post (SCMP).
The special administrative region’s financial regulator, the Securities and Futures Commission (SFC), has so far licensed only two crypto trading platforms, though 18 other exchanges are awaiting decisions on their applications.
Hong Kong launched new crypto exchange regulations last June. Some digital asset stakeholders have argued they are a burden for trading platforms, according to an SCMP report.
OKX, which is also headquartered in the Seychelles, is currently the third-largest crypto exchange by 24-hour trading volume, behind only Binance and Bybit, according to CoinGecko.

Ethereum price prediction for June 1 as whales move $118 million ETH


    Ethereum (ETH) is looking to reclaim the $4,000 mark after receiving a major boost from the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).



Excitingly, Ethereum investors are anticipating a potential surge in the cryptocurrency’s value following the U.S. regulator’s approval of a series of first-spot ETH exchange-traded funds (ETFs). 



Notably, there is a buzz of speculation about the possibility of Ethereum mirroring the price movement of Bitcoin (BTC), which experienced a significant rally after the approval of a similar product. 







Amid the rollout of the ETFs, Ethereum is witnessing significant whale activity. According to data shared by Whale Alert, three major transfers were observed from unknown wallets to the crypto exchange OKEx on May 25. 



The transactions involved 9,019 ETH (approximately $33,776,166), 22,429 ETH (valued at around $83,993,750), and 26,925 ETH (worth about $100,832,790), all moving to the exchange.

These transfers, totaling 58,373 ETH and equating to $118,602,706, have led to speculation regarding the impact on the valuation of the second-ranked cryptocurrency by market cap.



ETH price prediction 



Overall, significant movement of such large sums into exchanges could suggest an anticipation of heightened trading activity. Historically, large transfers to exchanges have sometimes preceded major price actions, either due to impending sell-offs or strategic positioning for significant market events.



To gather insights into how Ethereum is likely to trade in the coming days, Finbold turned to CoinCodex, leveraging its AI-powered machine-learning algorithms. According to CoinCodex’s projections, Ethereum is expected to trade at $3,813 on June 1, representing an increase of almost 2% from the current price.

Notably, the price projection could set the stage for Ethereum to target new highs following the ETF approval. 



For instance, crypto analyst RLinda suggested in a TradingView post on May 24 that the approval could act as a bullish catalyst. According to RLinda, if Ethereum consolidates above $3,827 and surpasses $4,095, it will likely target a new record high.



However, RLinda also cautioned that history might repeat itself, similar to the pattern observed with Bitcoin after the approval of BTC ETFs. Market makers could create a trap by causing a quick drop in price before an upward movement.



Ethereum price analysis



By press time, Ethereum was trading at $3,741. On the weekly chart, ETH has rallied by over 20%.

Meanwhile, the ETF approval acting as a catalyst for attracting institutional investors should encourage ETH bulls to work harder to sustain the price above $3,500.

Kim Jong Crypto (KIMCRYPT) Will Rally 14,000% Ahead of Bitrue Listing, as Shiba Inu, Bonk and Dogecoin Lag



                    

Early investors in memecoins like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Bonk (BONK) and Dogecoin (DOGE) made astronomical returns, and Kim Jong Crypto (KIMCRYPT) presents a similar opportunity for a limited time.



Kim Jong Crypto (KIMCRYPT), a newly launched Solana memecoin, is poised to explode over 14,000% in a matter of days, as former Shiba Inu (SHIB), Bonk (BONK) and Dogecoin (DOGE) investors pour funds into this new token.




KIMCRYPT will be listed on Bitrue, one of the largest centralized exchanges in the world, within a few days – and this is a massively bullish development for the token, as millions of new investors will easily be able to buy Kim Jong Crypto.



Currently, Kim Jong Crypto can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jupiter and Raydium, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days.



To buy KIMCRYPT on these platforms, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Kim Jong Crypto by entering its contract address – DY225ypZiG3aYkZnzaXJYDGtUz76uNuQiJLMzs6qGAZ5 – in the receiving field.




KIMCRYPT currently has a market cap of just under $13,000, with over $4,000 in locked liquidity, meaning it has huge upside potential.



Early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and Bonk (BONK) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price.



If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner.

Uniswap (UNI) Jumps 20% After Fee Proposal


The Uniswap Foundation announced that on-chain voting for a proposal to establish its new fee mechanism will occur by May 31.
This announcement has boosted the value of the network’s native token, UNI, by over 20%.
Uniswap’s New Fee Mechanism and Its Implications

The Uniswap Foundation outlined a crucial step towards implementing autonomous fee collection and distribution in Uniswap V3 pools.

“If passed, this proposal would transfer ownership of the mainnet UniswapV3Factory to a newly deployed instance of V3FactoryOwner. This vote will not turn on fees; that will be accomplished in a future proposal,” the Foundation explained.

In February, the Uniswap Foundation proposed a fee reward mechanism for UNI token holders to boost governance participation. Initial responses showed strong support for the proposal despite potential legal challenges from the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) against the DeFi protocol.
Traditionally, all fees generated by Uniswap went to liquidity providers (LPs) who supplied assets to the platform. The new proposal plans to distribute protocol fees among staked and delegated UNI token holders. Therefore incentivizing active participation within its ecosystem.
According to CryptoFees, Uniswap earned approximately $3.2 million in fees in the past 24 hours, averaging $3.4 million over the last week. The protocol handles roughly 30% of total trades in the decentralized finance sector.

In a parallel development, the Uniswap Foundation disclosed holding $41.41 million in fiat and stablecoins and 730,000 UNI tokens as of the end of the first quarter. During this period, the Foundation committed $4.34 million in new grants and disbursed $2.79 million in previously committed grants.

“The fiat (USD) cash and stables are to be used for grant making and operating activities and the UNI for employee token awards,” the Foundation remarked.

Marathon Digital to Use Kenya's Green Energy for Bitcoin Mining


Marathon Digital, a Bitcoin mining firm, signed an $80 million agreement with Kenya’s Ministry of Energy and Petroleum to boost the country’s renewable energy infrastructure.
Market observers explained that the partnership supports Marathon’s strategy to diversify its operations as mining difficulty increases.
Marathon to Build Green Data Centers in Kenya

Marathon Digital plans to invest over $80 million in developing renewable energy data centers. Kenya’s energy grid is approximately 80% renewable, leveraging wind, solar, hydroelectric, and geothermal sources, with geothermal energy being the largest contributor.
Furthermore, the initiative is expected to kickstart Marathon’s mining operations in Kenya, marking a significant step in its global expansion. Crypto environmentalist Daniel Batten praised the partnership, suggesting it points to the future of Bitcoin mining.

“Bitcoin mining’s future entails the development of more renewable energy that otherwise would have been unprofitable to monetize (geothermal in Kenya’s case). [This would] economically benefit entire nation-state [and ensure] geographic diversity of hashrate,” Batten noted.

Read more: Bitcoin Mining From Home: Is It Possible in 2024?
Marathon Digital CEO Fred Thiel emphasized the strategic benefits of partnering with Kenya, highlighting the country’s pivotal role in the digital currency evolution.

“Kenya has a special spot in the history of digital currencies as it is the home of M-PESA, which in 2007 was one of the first ways for people in Kenya and now across Africa to transmit value digitally by using mobile phone credits. Today tens of millions of people across Africa use M-PESA for branchless money transfers,” Thiel stated.


Bitcoin Mining Difficulty. Source: Glassnode
The initiative comes amid rising energy costs and increasing network mining difficulty. This week, Bitcoin’s mining difficulty rose 1.48% at block height 844,704, reaching 84.38 trillion. The increasing difficulty shows that more miners are joining the network, coinciding with a spike hash rate.

How Solana's NFT market surpassed Ethereum's - A 30-day snapshot - AMBCrypto



Solana’s NFT buyers and sellers remained higher than those of Ethereum
SOL’s price gained bullish momentum, but the trend might change

Solana [SOL] has once again dominated its competitors like Ethereum [ETH] in the NFT space over the past month. Now, while this seems optimistic at first glance, there might just be more to the story. Let’s have a look at how both of these NFT giants fared against each other.
Solana beats Ethereum
Coin98 recently shared a tweet underlining the latest datasets from the NFT ecosystem. According to the same, Solana is now ranked #1 on the list of blockchains in terms of the most NFTs created in the last 30 days. Apart from Solana, Polygon and Base also made it to the top three on the same list. 
Here, what is also worth mentioning is that Ethereum took the 10th spot on the list. While 32 million NFTs were created on Solana, only 1 million NFTs were created on Ethereum. This gave SOL a whopping lead of 31 million. 
AMBCrypto’s analysis of DappRadar’s data revealed that STEPN, SMB Gen2, and Mad Lads were the top NFT collections on Solana last month. Oddly enough, y00ts and DeGods, two projects that recently migrated to Solana, couldn’t make it to the top 5. 
While the aforementioned datasets imply one thing, a look at the bigger picture might imply something different entirely. For instance, AMBCrypto’s analysis of CryptoSlam’s data revealed that while Solana’s monthly NFT sales volume was merely $99 million, Ethereum’s sales volume stood at $193 million. 
Nonetheless, Solana’s number of NFT buyers and sellers remained significantly higher than that of Ethereum.

SOL turns bullish 
While Solana’s performance in the NFT space remained positive, SOL’s price action once again turned bullish. According to CoinMarketCap, SOL’s price surged by over 2.5% in the last 24 hours. At the time of writing, the token was trading at $169.30 with a market capitalization of over $76 billion. 
Thanks to the latest price uptick, the token’s weighted sentiment hiked too. This meant that bullish sentiment around the token was dominant in the market. Additionally, its social volume also appreciated on the charts, highlighting SOL’s popularity.

However, this trend might not last as a key derivatives market indicator flashed bearish signals at press time. Coinglass’ data revealed that Solana’s long/short ratio fell over the last 24 hours.

Ethereum’s Balance on Exchanges Spikes Amid Possible Sell-the-News Event, According to Crypto Analyst - The Daily Hodl


								A widely followed crypto analyst says that Ethereum’s (ETH) balance on crypto exchange platforms is spiking amid a possible sell-the-news event.
In a new thread, crypto trader Ali Martinez tells his 62,700 followers on the social media platform X that over the last two weeks, hundreds of thousands of ETH have been transferred to wallets linked to crypto exchanges.










“Looking at Ethereum’s balance on exchanges reveals a spike in the tokens available to sell. Over the last two weeks, over 242,000 ETH have moved to cryptocurrency exchange wallets. This indicates increased trading activity on exchanges that can contribute to price volatility.”
Source: Ali Martinez/X
According to Martinez, the massive ETH transfers are happening as a key signal – the Tom DeMark (TD) Sequential Indicator – is flashing a sell signal on the leading smart contract platform’s daily chart, hinting at the possibility of a sell-the-news event.
 “The increasing ETH deposits to cryptocurrency exchange wallets hint at the possibility of a sell-off or a spike in profit-taking. Meanwhile, the Tom DeMark (TD) Sequential indicator presents a sell signal on Ethereum’s daily chart. 
The current green nine candlesticks on the daily chart suggests that a spike in selling pressure could see ETH retrace for one to four daily candlesticks or even start a new downward countdown phase before the uptrend resumes.”
Source: Ali Martinez/X
The TD Sequential Indicator is generally used to predict potential trend reversals for assets based on their previous closings.
Martinez concludes by saying that Ethereum has a path toward the $5,000 price level if it prints a daily close above $4,170.
“The most important resistance barrier for Ethereum is between $3,940 and $4,054. Here, over 1.16 million addresses had previously purchased around 574,660 ETH. 
If ETH overcomes this hurdle and prints a daily candlestick close above $4,170, the bearish outlook will be invalidated. This could result in a new upward countdown phase toward $5,000.”
Source: Ali Martinez/X
Earlier this week, proposals to create ETH-based exchange-traded funds (ETFs) cleared a key regulatory hurdle, causing the Ethereum ecosystem to rise.
Ethereum is trading for $3,732 at time of writing, a 2.31% decrease during the last 24 hours.

Wizard Pepe (WIZPEPE) Will Skyrocket 18,000% as KuCoin Listing Announced, While Other Shiba Inu and Dogecoin Lag



                    

Wizard Pepe (WIZPEPE) could turn early investors into multi-millionaires if it becomes a mainstream coin, like Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE).



Wizard Pepe (WIZPEPE), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is poised to explode over 18,000% in price in the coming days.




This is because WIZPEPE has announced its first centralized exchange listing, which will be on KuCoin.



This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up.



Currently, Wizard Pepe can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jupiter and Raydium, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days.



Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Wizard Pepe could become the next viral memecoin.



Wizard Pepe launched with over $6,000 of locked liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains.



To buy Wizard Pepe on Raydium or Jupiter ahead of the KuCoin listing, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Wizard Pepe by entering its contract address – AJM9tnhfGz9xezv1rTjspoTug3YVpcmrp3gJ9FMDEEYj – in the receiving field.



In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price.




If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner.



The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum.




This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like WIZPEPE.

Shiba Inu on the Verge of 600% Rally? Analyst Weighs In


																Shiba Inu, known as the “Dogecoin Killer,” is eagerly anticipating a significant price leap. Market analyst Ashish has sparked excitement with a bold prediction: a 600% surge that could catapult the meme coin to an impressive $0.000075.

	Related Reading


This bullish forecast comes after what Ashish describes as a nearly two-year-long slumber within a consolidation pattern. December 2023 saw Shiba Inu finally break free from this price purgatory, breaching a crucial resistance trendline. The breakout ignited a rally that culminated in a 370% surge, reaching a 2024 high of $0.000045 in early March.
However, the party wasn’t meant to last. A correction ensued, prompting Ashish to establish strategic buying zones between $0.000022 and $0.000025.

Shiba Inu: Enter The Flag Pattern
Ashish’s crystal ball sees a bullish flag pattern emerging on the 1-hour chart, hinting at a potential “second leg up.” This technical indicator suggests a period of consolidation following a sharp price increase, often acting as a precursor to another upward movement.
Despite a slight price dip today, Shiba Inu appears to have room for growth. The daily Relative Strength Index (RSI) currently sits at nearly 48, indicating that the coin is neither overbought nor oversold. This neutral territory suggests potential for upward movement, aligning with Ashish’s prediction of a second leg up.

SHIB Price Forecast
Meanwhile, CoinCodex’s current Shiba Inu price prediction forecasts a rise of 220%, potentially reaching $0.00008089 by June 24, 2024. CoinCodex’s technical indicators currently show a Neutral sentiment, while the Fear & Greed Index stands at 76, indicating Extreme Greed. Over the past 30 days, Shiba Inu has seen 12 out of 30 green days (40%) with a price volatility of 4.40%.
Given these metrics, it’s clear that Shiba Inu’s market behavior is capturing significant investor interest. The Extreme Greed reading on the Fear & Greed Index suggests a high level of enthusiasm, which, while positive for potential price gains, also warrants caution due to the possibility of rapid sentiment shifts.
Source: CoinCodex
The coin’s moderate volatility and the occurrence of green days indicate a steady, albeit unpredictable, upward momentum. This combination of factors makes Shiba Inu a fascinating asset to watch in the coming months.

	Related Reading


As of today, the overall sentiment for the Shiba Inu price prediction is neutral. This assessment is supported by technical analysis indicators, where 20 indicators are showing bullish signals, while eight are signaling bearish trends.
This balanced sentiment reflects the inherent volatility and speculative nature of cryptocurrencies. The fact that a significant number of indicators are bullish suggests there is optimism about Shiba Inu’s short-term potential, possibly driven by recent market activities or positive news.

BNB Forms Bullish Flag Pattern On 1-Day Chart - What's Next? | Bitcoinist.com


								After a rally to create an all-time high, the price of Binance Coin (BNB) has been in a consolidation zone. During this consolidation, BNB’s price has managed to form a bullish triangle flag above the 100-day Simple Moving Average (SMA) in the 1-day timeframe.
Currently, the price of Binance coin is moving between the $647 resistance level and the $498 support level building momentum for a bullish breakout with a total capitalization of $89,412,113,586, which is about 1.70% up in the last 24 hours, and a trading volume of $1,535,069,940, over 37% down in the last 24 hours. At the time of writing, BNB’s price was trading around $604 above the 100-day simple moving average, about 0.65% up in the last 24 hours.
BNB Technical Analysis Using Key Indicators
Technically looking at the digital asset’s price chart in the 1-day timeframe, it can observed that the price is trading above the 100-day moving average. This could be an indication that BNB might move upward, therefore, suggesting that it could break above the upper base of the bullish triangle for an upward movement.

The signal line of the Relative Strength Index (RSI) having moved above and below the zero line is currently trending above the zero line. This formation of the RSI indicator suggests that the price might go bullish and break above the upper base of the bullish triangle.
The Williams alligator indicator also suggests that the price might move upward as both the alligator teeth and jaw are above the alligator lip, while the price is above the indicator. With this formation, it can be suggested that BNB’s price might rally above the bullish triangle.

Potential Price Results 
Finally, if the price of BNB breaks above the bullish triangle, it might move to break the previous high of $647, and if it breaks this level, the price might move even higher to create a new all-time high.
If the crypto asset fails to break above the bullish triangle, it might move downward and break below the bullish triangle and might even move further toward the $498 support level. Should it break this level it might undergo a deeper correction to test the $384 support level.

US Bitcoin spot ETFs attract $2 billion in net inflows over two weeks - Crypto Briefing


            
            
                            
            
                            
            
            Investors have poured around $2 billion into US spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) over the past two weeks, according to data from Farside. These funds also recorded a tenth consecutive day of net inflows.This week alone, US spot Bitcoin ETFs saw over $1 billion in inflows, with Thursday recording the largest daily inflow of around $305 million.BlackRock’s Bitcoin ETF, iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT), led the pack with nearly $720 million in weekly inflows. Fidelity’s Wise Origin Bitcoin Fund (FBTC) took the second spot with around $227 million.US Spot Bitcoin ETF Inflows – May 13-24 – FarsideThe order was different last week when FBTC surpassed IBIT in terms of weekly inflows. Data shows that FBTC recorded around $344 million in inflows from May 13 to 17 while IBIT saw approximately $132 million.With over 284,525 BTC in its holdings, IBIT is just $300 million away from surpassing Grayscale Bitcoin Trust, which currently holds 289 BTC, valued at $19.9 billion. This calculation is based on Bitcoin (BTC) being worth $69,100 as of the writing, according to CoinGecko. IBIT is well on track to become the largest Bitcoin ETF.Meanwhile, Bitcoin’s price moved in the same direction with strong ETF inflows in the last two weeks.On May 24, this week’s final trading day, the price soared to $69,000, up around 13% over the past two weeks. Bitcoin is now only 6% away from its record high of $73,700, established in March.Bitcoin had stagnated after the fourth halving, which analyst Rekt Capital pointed out as the post-halving “danger zone” characterized by heightened volatility. He noted last week, however, that the selling pressure was weakening; Bitcoin was entering a phase of accumulation.In addition to Bitcoin ETFs, the week’s spotlight was on the SEC’s approval of spot Ethereum ETF filings. These ETFs still need S-1 form approval to begin trading, which ETF experts believe will take weeks to months. However, in essence, the approval of spot Ethereum ETFs indicates that the launch of these funds is imminent.Positive developments prior to the approval had factored into the surge in Ethereum’s price (ETH). On Monday, ETH jumped 8% on news that approval odds were raised to 75%. Rally extended during the day with a broader market upswing. At press time, ETH is trading at around $3,700, up over 20% over the past seven days.

Apple Denies Monopoly Claims, Asserts Strong Competition in Response to U.S. Antitrust Lawsuit



                    

Apple has denied being a “monopolist” and insisted it faces “fierce competition” in the tech industry, according to a letter previewing its defense against a U.S. antitrust lawsuit.



In a letter dated May 21 to New Jersey federal judge Julien Neals, Apple’s attorneys requested a conference before filing a motion to dismiss the case. 




They refuted U.S. allegations that Apple engaged in anticompetitive practices by restricting third-party access to its platform and designing products to “lock in” users to purchasing iPhones.



The company argued that its purported anticompetitive behavior merely involved making independent decisions regarding the terms and conditions for third-party access to its proprietary platform.



In March, the Justice Department filed an antitrust lawsuit against Apple, accusing the firm of holding a smartphone monopoly. 




The suit claimed Apple restricted features of digital wallets and payments and enforced App Store rules that stifled competition.



Apple’s restrictions on fiat-only payments have also impacted the use of cryptocurrencies in iOS apps, making it financially unfeasible for crypto apps to offer in-app purchases due to a 30% fee known as the “Apple Tax.”



“Apple has opted to offer users a curated, secure, and reliable experience, in contrast to its competitors’ more open platforms,” the company stated.



Apple contended that the government did not “properly define the relevant market or establish that Apple has monopoly power in it,” and any alleged anticompetitive behavior occurred in different markets, such as digital wallets.

“These products all exist in their own separate markets with their own competitive dynamics, and the Government’s failure to define the proper market for those products is fatal,” Apple asserted.



Apple further argued that the U.S. claims were invalid, citing the Supreme Court’s stance that a company’s decisions regarding third-party dealings do not constitute exclusionary conduct.



The company also countered the DOJ’s claim of a smartphone monopoly, asserting it faces strong competition from Google and Samsung, noting Google has the most-used mobile OS and Samsung leads in global smartphone sales.



The U.S. failed to provide a factual link demonstrating that Apple’s design decisions corner smartphone buyers, Apple claimed.



“Someone unhappy with Apple’s limitations has every incentive to switch to competitor platforms that ostensibly do not have those limitations,” the company stated.



Following the DOJ’s March filing, an Apple spokesperson told Cointelegraph that the lawsuit could “set a dangerous precedent” and potentially allow the government to heavily influence the design of technology.

Historical Cycle Data Suggests Bitcoin Is Out Of The Danger Zone - Is Return To $73,000 Imminent? ⋆ ZyCrypto

&nbsp

&nbsp
Bitcoin has officially left the post-halving “danger zone” where there is a possibility of a drop below its range low, and is now headed for reaccumulation, according to a popular crypto strategist citing historical data. 



The Bitcoin price recently experienced a retracement and currently hovers around $69,000 despite the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission’s (SEC) eventual approval of several spot Ethereum exchange-traded funds (ETFs). With Bitcoin escaping the danger zone, will the preeminent crypto resume its upward movement soon, or is a deeper correction still likely?



Bitcoin’s Sideways Trading To Continue For Several More Weeks: Analyst



On May 24, crypto trader and analyst Rekt Capital posted an update on X, noting that the classic Bitcoin “danger zone” when the asset corrects after the quadrennial halving event is now behind us.



The post-halving danger zone has happened in prior market cycles when the asset corrects after a block subsidy halving, as per Rekt Capital. After the danger zone is over, Bitcoin historically enters a reaccumulation phase when it moves sideways within a tight range. This suggests that further pullbacks during the period of sideways chop that often follows the halving could still be on the cards.



“Since the Bitcoin post-halving ‘danger zone’ ended, Bitcoin broke out to $71,500. However, ~$71,500 is where the range high resistance of the macro re-accumulation range is and this is where Bitcoin rejected from,” Rekt Capital wrote. “The consolidation continues and history suggests it will continue for several more weeks between $60,000 and $70,000.”

&nbsp



Rekt Capital further observed that based on historical behavior, Bitcoin is likely to remain range-bound below $70,000 until September.



“Historically, Bitcoin has always rejected from the range high on the first attempt at a breakout after the halving. Moreover, history suggests this re-accumulation should last much longer. Bitcoin tends to break out from these re-accumulation ranges only up to 160 days after the halving. That would translate to a Bitcoin breakout from the re-accumulation range only in September 2024.” 



Bitcoin Price At A Glance



In this cycle, Bitcoin dipped by over 20% from its $73,737 all-time high in mid-March to around $56,780 on May 1, marking the potential bottom of the post-halving danger zone period. 



On May 21, Bitcoin’s price briefly topped the psychologically important $70K mark; however, it swiftly dropped to around $67,000. BTC has now recovered and is trading back to $69,176 at press time, bolstering the return to the reaccumulation zone analysis.



Although the flagship crypto appears stuck in sideways price action, industry pundits remain uber-bullish. For instance, veteran crypto market commentator Tom Lee said his base case for Bitcoin by the end of the year is $150,000.

AVAX price prediction - Identifying the altcoin's targets for 2024 - AMBCrypto



AVAX seemed to be consolidating around $38, despite mixed market signals
Bullish sentiment on Binance and resistances at $50 and $55 could drive the price to $100

With the cryptocurrency market on fire over recent developments, Avalanche (AVAX) has caught the eye of many investors. Historically, AVAX has shown resilience, even when caught in the toughest bear markets. 
At press time, AVAX was valued at $38.49 after appreciating by 2.5% in just 24 hours. While this didn’t amount to significant gains, AVAX seemed to be doing much better than many of the market’s other altcoin. What does this mean for AVAX’s price performance through the rest of the year?
For starters, the current state of the AVAX market is marked by neutral sentiment, with a 42% rating on the Fear and Greed Index – A sign of balanced views among investors. 
Source: CFGI
While social sentiment was very positive at press time, other indicators like volatility, volume, and whale activity were negative – A sign of market uncertainty and reduced trading activity. Additionally, the dominance and search interest for AVAX has been fairly negative too, highlighting a lack of market control and lower general interest.
In fact, Coinglass’ data revealed a massive fall in trading volume by 61.37%, with the same recording figures of $341.19 million at the time of writing. On the trading side, the long/short ratio seemed relatively balanced across different platforms. This means traders aren’t sure what to do with AVAX right now. 
Source: Coinglass
Interestingly, however, the long/short ratio on Binance seemed to be considerably high at 2.8805. This could indicate a more bullish sentiment among individual traders on this one exchange.
It’s also worth noting that the six-month Avalanche chart highlighted a volatile trading pattern with several peaks and troughs. Simply put, a market responsive to broader market trends and specific ecosystem developments.
Over the past few months, AVAX has noted many price spikes followed by sharp corrections on the charts. Right now, the altcoin seems to be consolidating around the $38-level after a recent downtrend from higher levels seen in April.
Source: TradingView
If AVAX maintains support around the $35-level, there could be potential for northbound movement, especially when the bull run starts. Key resistance levels to watch would be around $50 and $55, levels that AVAX has tested multiple times in the past few months. 
A sustained break above these levels could signal strong bullish momentum, possibly driving the price towards the $80-mark or even $100 in the year’s third quarter.

Bitcoin and Ether Dip 3.5% Amid Institutional ETF Approval and Market Uncertainty



                    

Bitcoin and Ether both experienced a 3.5% drop on May 24, disappointing many who anticipated a market boost from a significant institutional development.



According to Cointelegraph Markets Pro and TradingView, BTC hovered near $67,000, while ETH was priced at $3,670. 




The expected market reaction to the U.S. regulators’ approval of spot Ether exchange-traded funds (ETFs) did not materialize. 



This landmark decision for the crypto industry marks a significant policy reversal by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). 



However, the ETFs are not yet ready for trading, as additional preparations are required, which analysts suggest could take several weeks, pushing the potential launch to mid-June.




James Seyffart and Eric Balchunas, ETF analysts at Bloomberg Intelligence, discussed the possibility of a mid-June launch for the ETFs. 



Consequently, BTC/USD and ETH/USD did not see a significant upward movement, instead retracting from local highs as the daily trading session closed.



Market participants were particularly interested in the interplay between Bitcoin and Ethereum, the two largest cryptocurrencies.

Daan Crypto Trades, a well-known trader, highlighted the impact of Ethereum’s recent rally on Bitcoin’s market dominance.



“With the recent $ETH rally, we’ve seen #Bitcoin Dominance head back down,” he stated on X. 



“This has been in an up trend for about 1.5 years and if there’s anything that could reverse this trend it would be ETH leading on the back of an ETF being approved. 52% and 48% are the main levels.”



Other traders echoed this sentiment, suggesting that a shift in dominance could signal the beginning of an “altseason.” 



Bitcoin’s dominance reached 57% in mid-April, its highest in over two years, just before the block subsidy halving event.



Popular trader Skew analyzed potential support levels for BTC, identifying a key zone around $66,000. In his May 23 analysis, he noted significant bid liquidity on Binance, the largest global exchange.



“Seeing some initial spot demand around $66K – $65K, reaction is key as well to gauge absorption of sellers. Spot supply remains around current high $72K – $76K,” he confirmed.



Skew emphasized that the recent price movements were primarily driven by spot exchanges, particularly highlighting Binance and Coinbase, the largest U.S. trading platform.

$1,800,000,000,000 Bank Says Customers' Personal Information Has Been Exposed and Accessed in Mysterious Data Breach - The Daily Hodl


								One of the largest banks in the world says a data breach has exposed information on both its customers and employees.
In a statement, Santander says it’s aware of “unauthorized access” to a third-party database containing information on an undisclosed number of customers and employees.










The bank, which has $1.8 trillion in total assets and operates in ten markets across Europe and the Americas, says customers of Santander Chile, Spain and Uruguay are affected.
“Following an investigation, we have now confirmed that certain information relating to customers of Santander Chile, Spain and Uruguay, as well as all current and some former Santander employees of the group had been accessed. Customer data in all other Santander markets and businesses are not affected.”
So far, the bank has not disclosed which types of data have been exposed, noting only that “transactional data” and “credentials” are not in the open.
“No transactional data, nor any credentials that would allow transactions to take place on accounts are contained in the database, including online banking details and passwords. The bank’s operations and systems are not affected, so customers can continue to transact securely.
We apologise for the concern this will understandably cause and are proactively contacting affected customers and employees directly. We have also notified regulators and law enforcement and will continue to work closely with them.”
The bank says it has implemented measures to contain the incident, including “blocking the compromised access to the database and establishing additional fraud prevention controls to protect affected customers.”
Santander’s data breach comes weeks after JPMorgan Chase revealed a breach affecting 451,809 customers’ retirement records, which contain names, addresses, Social Security numbers and bank account numbers.
In that instance, Chase says there’s currently no indication that the data has been misused.

Incognito Market Owner Arrested After FBI Tracked Crypto Transactions


																A Taiwanese national has been charged with running Incognito Market, a darknet drug bazaar, and arrested after authorities tracked the platform’s transactions.
The platform has transacted more than $100 million in crypto through selling illegal narcotics such as fentanyl.
Incognito Market Founder Arrested and Charged
On May 18, U.S. authorities arrested Rui-Siang Lin, 23, operating under the pseudonym “Pharoah,” at New York’s John F. Kennedy Airport. According to FBI Assistant Director in Charge James Smith, Lin ran Incognito Market for about four years, was in charge of its operations, including vendors, employees, and customers, and was the primary decision maker.
During this time, Lin gathered millions of dollars in personal profit, and Incognito Market grew to become one of the biggest online narcotics sales platforms. The platform facilitated the buying and selling of drugs such as prescription amphetamines like Adderall, MDMA, LSD, and cocaine using Monero and Bitcoin. In turn, Lin took a 5% cut of every sale as users channeled funds through the platform.
Lin is facing charges including one count of money laundering, one count of engaging in a continuing criminal enterprise, one count of narcotics conspiracy, and one count of conspiracy to sell misbranded and adulterated medication.




According to the FBI, they identified the Incognito Market owner by tracking crypto from the marketplace to an exchange account in his name. FBI task force officer Mark Rubens said the exchange provided Lin’s driver’s license, email, and phone number.
U.S. Attorney Damian Williams stated on Monday, when Lin appeared in court, that the so-called “dark web” is not a sanctuary for individuals attempting to engage in unlawful activities.
Lin Faces Life Sentence
Incognito Market ceased operations in March after an exit scam left users unable to access their funds. Administrators then reportedly began demanding vendors to pay fees ranging from $100 to $20,000 based on their size to prevent their customer data from being publicly leaked.
Despite the allegations, Lin, who identifies as a crypto developer and enthusiast of privacy coin Monero, disclosed on X that he conducted a four-day workshop on cybercrime and cryptocurrency for 30 police officers at the Saint Lucia Police Academy in early April.
If convicted, Lin is looking at a mandatory life sentence on a criminal enterprise charge. Meanwhile, Ross Ulbricht, the individual behind the Silk Road darknet drug marketplace, faced similar charges and was convicted of the same crime. He received a life sentence in prison.
Notably, the narcotics conspiracy charge Lin faces carries a mandatory minimum sentence of 10 years and a maximum potential sentence of life imprisonment. The other two charges carry a combined maximum sentence of 25 years in prison.

Decentralized Education Altcoin Surges by 117% This Week Amid Node Sale and Purchase Announcement From Web3 Firm - The Daily Hodl


								The native altcoin of a decentralized education platform surged by over 117% this week amid news that a web3 firm has plans to purchase the token.
Open Campus’ governance and utility asset, EDU, is trading at $1.10 at time of writing, up from its seven-day low of $0.505.










The 252nd-ranked crypto asset is also up more than 12% in the past 24 hours.
Open Campus aims to foster an ecosystem that “connects learners, educators, content creators and educational institutions,” according to the project’s whitepaper. The EDU Chain bills itself as the “first layer-3 blockchain built for education.”
EDU’s price surge materialized as Animoca Brands, a web3 and blockchain gaming firm, announced a plan to acquire more EDU tokens on the open market.
Explains Animoca,
“Animoca Brands firmly supports the work of Open Campus and the EDU Foundation, including in particular the upcoming EDU Chain, the first layer-3 (L3) blockchain specifically designed to serve the global education industry, which is estimated to grow to $8 trillion in value by 2030.”
Open Campus also announced the upcoming sale of principal nodes for the EDU Chain. Principal node operators earn rewards by validating transactions on the EDU Chain.
The sales dates will be revealed next month, according to the project.
Despite its price gains this week, EDU remains more than 34% down from its all-time high of $1.67, which it hit in April 2023, according to CoinGecko.

Shiba Inu, BONK, And Floki Score Major Listing On The Coinbase Exchange | Bitcoinist.com


								America’s largest cryptocurrency exchange, Coinbase will list another round of cryptocurrencies for its perpetual futures contract, opting for meme coins this time around and featuring prominent tokens like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Bonk (BONK) and Floki (FLOKI). 
Coinbase Perpetuals To List New Meme Coins
On May 24, Coinbase International Exchange announced that it will start offering perpetual futures contracts for three doggy-themed meme coins, Shiba Inu, Bonk and Floki. The crypto exchange made the official statement in an X (formerly Twitter) post, highlighting that the above cryptocurrencies will commence trading officially on Thursday, May 30, on or after 9:30 am. 

This move will signify the integration of Shiba Inu, Bonk and Floki into Coinbase’s derivatives market, opening up trading for these popular coins to the crypto exchange’s extensive user base. Given that Coinbase limits perpetual futures trading to non-US customers, this strategic move is poised to expand more trading opportunities for global crypto enthusiasts. 
Additionally, the crypto exchange has disclosed that trades will be conducted on Coinbase International Exchange and Coinbase Advanced, a subsidiary trading platform designed specifically for more experienced traders. 
Coinbase has also revealed the upcoming launch of 1000BONK-PERP, 1000FLOKI-PERP, and 1000SHIB-PERP. This implies that the new listing will feature smart contracts multiplied by 1,000 for derivatives traders on the exchange. 
Earlier last month, the crypto exchange introduced two other meme coins, Pepe (PEPE and Dogecon (DOGE) in its derivatives contracts. Following the launch, 1000PEPE-PERP became one of the most traded meme coins in Coinbase’s derivatives market. 
Coinbase most likely anticipates a similar surge in demand for its newly listed meme coins, given that Shiba Inu, Bonk and Floki are highly sought-after cryptocurrencies in the market, ranking in the top 10 by market capitalization among meme coins. 
Moreover, since the beginning of the month, Coinbase International Exchange has expanded its support for numerous popular cryptocurrencies for its perpetual futures contracts. A day before SHIB, BONK and FLOKI’s listing announcement, the exchange unveiled the commencement of trading for Ondo Finance (ONDO), Pyth Network (PYTH) and ZetaChain (ZETA) perpetual futures. 
Shiba Inu, BONK And FLOKI Gain Momentum
Following Coinbase’s listing declaration, Shiba Inu, Bonk and Floki witnessed new gains. Despite experiencing marginal declines over the past week, SHIB’s price has slightly rebounded by 4.55% in the last 24 hours, now trading at $0.000024.
BONK, which saw the highest gains between SHIB and FLOKI, rose significantly by 12.73%, pushing its price to $0.000036 at the time of writing. Meanwhile, Floki experienced a notable 7.75% increase, driving its price up to $0.00023.

While Coinbase’s new derivatives listing may have potentially bolstered the prices of these cryptocurrencies, their daily trading volume has recorded a significant decline. According to CoinMarketCap, Shiba Inu’s 24-hour trading volume plummeted by 54.93%, Floki witnessed a decline of 40.44%, and Bonk experienced a substantial 47.56% drop. 
Although this decline in trading activity underscores pessimistic investor sentiment, SHIB, BONK, and FLOKI have been steadily gaining momentum despite market volatility and prevailing conditions.

New Memecoin Junkyard Cat (JUNKCAT) to Skyrocket 14,000% as KuCoin Listing Announced, While Shiba Inu and Dogecoin Struggle



                    

Junkyard Cat (JUNKCAT) could turn early investors into multi-millionaires if it becomes a mainstream coin, like Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE).



Junkyard Cat (JUNKCAT), a new Solana memecoin that was launched this week, is poised to explode over 14,000% in price in the coming days.




This is because JUNKCAT has announced its first centralized exchange listing, which will be on KuCoin.



This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up.



Currently, Junkyard Cat can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jupiter and Raydium, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days.




Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Junkyard Cat could become the next viral memecoin.



Junkyard Cat launched with over $6,000 of locked liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains.



To buy Junkyard Cat on Raydium or Jupiter ahead of the KuCoin listing, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Junkyard Cat by entering its contract address – 6AdCuXXoxVMzPnczLjgqC9nQSBtcXnffVvRs8JsQvHhM – in the receiving field.



In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price.




If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner.



The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum.



This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like JUNKCAT.

Kim Jong Crypto (KIMCRYPT) Will Rally 14,000% Before Bitrue Listing, as Shiba Inu, Bonk and Dogecoin Lag



                    

Early investors in memecoins like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Bonk (BONK) and Dogecoin (DOGE) made astronomical returns, and Kim Jong Crypto (KIMCRYPT) presents a similar opportunity for a limited time.



Kim Jong Crypto (KIMCRYPT), a newly launched Solana memecoin, is poised to explode over 14,000% in a matter of days, as former Shiba Inu (SHIB), Bonk (BONK) and Dogecoin (DOGE) investors pour funds into this new token.




KIMCRYPT will be listed on Bitrue, one of the largest centralized exchanges in the world, within a few days – and this is a massively bullish development for the token, as millions of new investors will easily be able to buy Kim Jong Crypto.



Currently, Kim Jong Crypto can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jupiter and Raydium, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days.



To buy KIMCRYPT on these platforms, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Kim Jong Crypto by entering its contract address – DY225ypZiG3aYkZnzaXJYDGtUz76uNuQiJLMzs6qGAZ5 – in the receiving field.



KIMCRYPT currently has a market cap of just under $13,000, with over $4,000 in locked liquidity, meaning it has huge upside potential.



Early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and Bonk (BONK) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price.

Trump Pledges to Free Silk Road Creator Ross Ulbricht If Re-Elected

Before Trump’s presidency ended in January 2021, he granted clemency to 143 individuals – pardoning 73, including Ripple board member Ken Kurson, and commuting the sentences of 70 others. He did not offer clemency to Ulbricht, Wikileaks founder Julian Assange or Edward Snowden, who released details about a U.S. surveillance program to American journalist Glenn Greenwald.

Dogecoin Price Prediction: A 30% Crash Before A 1,300% Rally? Analyst Tells All | Bitcoinist.com


								The Dogecoin (DOGE) future trajectory continues to be heavily discussed, with crypto analysts weighing where the foremost meme coin is headed. Crypto analyst Capt Toblerone’s analysis comes under the spotlight, given how the foremost meme coin’s price action has continued to align with his prediction. 
DOGE’s 30% Crash Still In Play
In an X (formerly Twitter) post, Capt Toblerone mentioned that Dogecoin will experience a 30% price drawdown from its current price level. He further claimed that the next reload area is at $0.108. He predicted that Dogecoin would make a 1,300% rally from that level, stating that one should get 13x from the reload area. 

Source: X
A 1,300% move for Dogecoin means the meme coin will rise to as high as $1.5. This prediction aligns with others made by crypto analysts like Ali Martinez, who predict that the meme coin could reach $1 in this cycle. This also looks feasible given that crypto analyst Kevin (formerly OG Yomi) once alluded to Dogecoin’s move in previous bull markets as why the meme coin could rally above $3. 
However, while Dogecoin looks primed to make such a parabolic move, Pav Hundal, lead analyst for Australian exchange Swyftx, has explained what could hinder the meme coin from reaching $1. He alluded to the fact that some Dogecoin holders bought the meme coin at its market peak in the last bull run. 
He believes that these holders will look to take profits once DOGE hits a new all-time high (ATH) in this bull cycle. Therefore, depending on the magnitude, such selling pressure could derail the meme coin from reaching $1. He also suggested that DOGE might see enough liquidity to push it to such a level since many more meme coins are in the market now. 
However, crypto analyst Rekt Capital disagrees with Hundal. He labeled Dogecoin “one of the most cyclical altcoins in the space.” Therefore, he expects the meme coin to make a parabolic move, as it has in previous cycles. 
Dogecoin Could Indeed Drop To $0.10
Crypto analyst CrediBULL Crypto has also predicted that Dogecoin could drop to as low as $0.10. However, the analyst expects the meme coin to first experience a relief pump and rise to as high as $0.18. He revealed that he will be looking to short the meme coin at the $0.18 price level as it descends to $0.10. 

However, Dogecoin isn’t the only meme coin CrediBULL Crypto expects to drop significantly. He predicts that other foremost meme coins like Pepe (PEPE) and Dogwifhat (WIF) will experience a price dropdown given the kind of rally they have enjoyed this year. 
At the time of writing, Dogecoin is trading at around $0.16, up over 4% in the last 24 hours, according to data from CoinMarketCap.

LDO's potential 250% uptick - Thank you, Ethereum? - AMBCrypto



Buying pressure on Lido remained high throughout the past week
Most indicators and market sentiment looked bullish on LDO’s charts

The hype around Ethereum ETFs had a positive impact on Lido DAO [LDO] as the token pushed its price up considerably. Such was the scale of price appreciation that in the last 24 hours alone, the crypto registered double-digit gains on its charts. 
Lido’s bull rally
Lido was one of the tokens that benefited the most from the Ethereum ETF approval episode, as its price rallied by more than 40% in the last 7 days. According to CoinMarketCap, in the last 24 hours, the token’s value hiked by over 11%. At press time, it was trading at $2.53 with a market capitalization of over $2.25 billion. 
However, the interesting bit here is that while Lido grew by double digits, ETH’s value only hiked by 1% over the aforementioned period. In fact, LDO’s price might do even better since a bullish pattern is now expected to emerge on its price chart. 
World of Charts, a popular crypto-analyst, recently posted a tweet revealing a bullish flag pattern. The latest price uptick pushed LDO’s price towards the upper limit of the pattern. A breakout above the same could propel further growth of nearly 250% in the coming weeks. 
Will LDO grow further?
To see whether LDO would manage to break above the bull pattern, AMBCrypto analyzed Santiment’s data. As per our analysis, LDO’s exchange outflows increased sharply last week. This pointed to a hike in buying pressure. The fact that investors have been buying LDO was further proven by its exchange data. 
The token’s supply on exchanges plummeted sharply, while its supply outside of exchanges rose. A hike in buying pressure often results in price hikes, increasing the chances of a bullish breakout. However, the token’s supply held by top addresses dropped on 24 May – A sign that whales sold their holdings to earn profits.

We then analyzed its daily chart to better understand whether LDO would continue its bull rally. The technical indicator MACD displayed a clear bullish upper hand in the market. 
Additionally, the Relative Strength Index (RSI) also registered a sharp uptick, hinting at a sustained price hike. Nonetheless, the token’s price did touch the upper limit of the Bollinger Bands, which often results in price corrections.

How to Add Solana to Metamask | Cryptoglobe


                                
Blockchains have diverse architectures, leading to interoperability challenges. Fortunately, various third-party solutions like bridges, extensions, wrapped assets, and cross-chain protocols enable asset utilization across different ecosystems and wallets. While it’s not possible to manage SOL and SLP tokens directly on MetaMask, we can still use a third-party to manage our Solana-based funds, all while remaining connected to MetaMask.



MetaMask Snaps, developed by Consensys engineers, allows users to manage their funds on various networks, such as Solana, within MetaMask via an extension. 



Solflare, the protocol behind the popular wallet of the same name, developed the Solana Snap function, allowing users to manage their Metamask wallets through a Solflare interface. 



In this article, you’ll learn how to add the Solana Snap to your Metamask wallet. Just follow these steps below.



How to Add Solana Snap to MetaMask



Go to the MetaMask Snap Directory either from your MetaMask wallet or Solflare MetaMask landing page.



Search for ‘Solana’ and click on ‘Solana Wallet’ by Solflare.



Click “Add to MetaMask” and confirm the link request, accepting terms and conditions.







Continue to Solflare’s website and click “Get Started” to initiate installation.







Connect to MetaMask when prompted. Wait for the process to finish and confirm the connection request.



Once completed, your Solflare Solana Wallet is ready for use.



You can bookmark the dashboard page for easy access, that way you don’t have to insert your password phrase.



Also read: How to Use Uniswap With MetaMask



Bridging SOL to MetaMask



Now that you have successfully installed the Solana Snap extension, you can bridge assets from other networks directly from your Snap wallet. 



Solflare’s Snap wallet allows users to bridge assets from other networks, including Ethereum, BNB Chain, Arbitrum, Avalanche, and Polygon. Users can bridge stablecoins and reverse the process at any time. To bridge assets:



Access the Solflare interface and click on the Bridge tabSelect the relevant chains, enter the desired amount, and click “Review.”The MetaMask wallet is automatically chosen as the recipient account.Confirm the transaction to complete the bridging process.







Note: Solana assets can’t be managed directly on MetaMask; you’ll need to use the Solflare interface. Disabling or deleting the Solana wallet Snap interrupts its interaction with Metamask but doesn’t delete your portfolio; it’s restored upon reinstallation. And though a new wallet is created, it shares the same private keys as your Metamask wallet.



Benefits Of MetaMask Snaps



The integration of Solana blockchain into MetaMask expands its functionality, enabling users to engage with Solana’s high throughput and low transaction costs alongside their existing EVM-compatible assets. 



This integration promotes greater interoperability within the crypto ecosystem, simplifying asset management across different blockchains through a unified wallet interface.







            
            

            
            

            
            

        

Here’s what you can do with Solana Snap in MetaMask:



Manage Solana-Based Tokens and NFTs: Hold SOL and manage Solana tokens and NFTs within the MetaMask environment.



Swap and Stake: Participate in swapping and staking activities directly from your MetaMask wallet.



Bridge Assets: Seamlessly bridge your assets from EVM to SOL.



Connect to Solana Apps: Access Solana’s vibrant ecosystem of decentralized applications (dApps) without the need to install a separate Solana wallet.



View and Manage Assets: Although you can’t directly view and manage your Solana assets stored in MetaMask within the wallet’s interface, you can utilize the Solflare interface or a widget embedded within each Solana app you connect with.



Connecting MetaMask to Solana dApps



Now that you have your wallet ready to go, you can connect to multiple dApps on the Solana ecosystem, like Jupiter, Jito, or Solend. For this particular example, we’ll use Jito, a MEV staking platform. 



Follow the steps below:



Begin by connecting your Solana Snap wallet. Click on “Connect Wallet” and choose MetaMask. Then, click “Continue.”







The app will automatically choose the Snap wallet for you. Make sure you keep the second popup window open, as it is required for every application where you intend to use your Solana Snap wallet.



Click on Connect.







Done, now you can use Snap wallet on Jito.







The process is quite similar for other dApps on Solana. We just need to make sure we choose Metamask, and follow the previous steps. For example, we can integrate Metamask to Solend by clicking on Connect Wallet and choosing Metamask, and repeat the process.







Frequently Asked Questions



Here is a FAQ about the Solana Wallet Snap:



Is the Snap Wallet Custodial? 



No, the Solflare wallet runs with the associated MetaMask wallet, so it does not issue new private keys for the Solana Snap wallet.



What Happens if I Delete/Reinstall My of Solana Snap 



Deleting or deactivating your Solana Wallet Snap halts its interaction with your MetaMask wallet. However, upon reinstallation of the Solana Wallet Snap, your previous portfolio remains intact.



Can I Manage Solana Assets Directly On MetaMask



No. You can only do it through the Solflare interface.



What is MetaMask Snaps?



MetaMask Snaps enable developers to create external applications that utilize the MetaMask infrastructure. These include interoperability Snaps like the Solana Wallet Snap and transaction insights Snaps aimed at enhancing security.

Binance Doubles Down on Low Float, High FDV: Calls for Action


																There has been a growing concern regarding the increased traction of tokens with high valuations but low initial circulating supply, which has sparked discussions about the sustainability of upside potential for traders following the token generation event (TGE).
Binance Research’s latest findings have confirmed this trend, depicting an increasing number of tokens being launched with limited circulating supply and inflated valuations.
High Valuation, Low Liquidity Crisis
An influx of private market capital, coupled with aggressive valuations and an upbeat market outlook, has stimulated the practice of cryptocurrency tokens launching at steeply high, fully diluted valuation (FDV) points.
The report estimates that around $155 billion worth of tokens will be unlocked from 2024 to 2030. This significant influx of tokens into the market, without a proportional increase in buy-side demand and capital flows, could exert substantial selling pressure, as per the report, which, in turn, would challenge the market’s ability to absorb these tokens without negatively impacting prices.
“Under bullish market conditions, these tokens can experience rapid price appreciation due to limited liquidity available for trading at launch. However, it is apparent that this kind of price growth is unsustainable when a wave of token supply hits the market upon unlocking.”
The analysis further highlights a widening gap between market caps and fully diluted valuations (FDVs) for tokens launched over the past three years, with 2024’s FDVs already approaching 2023’s totals. Tokens launched in 2024 have an average MC/FDV ratio of just 12.3%, implying around $80 billion in new demand would be needed to match future supply increases and maintain current prices.




This appears to be primarily driven by recent token launches with extremely low circulating supplies, often under 20% of the total supply. With the majority of tokens locked, their FDVs are inflated compared to actual market caps.
Addressing The Trend
As reported earlier, well over 80% of the newly listed cryptocurrencies have experienced a decline in their worth on Binance.
It was also found that most tokens newly gracing Binance’s listing boards are backed by top-tier VC firms which are launched at inflated valuations, with the average fully diluted valuation exceeding $4.2 billion at listing and some tokens even surpassing the $11 billion mark. These projects were observed to lack an established user base or proper community support potentially.

Junkyard Cat Memecoin to Skyrocket 14,000% as KuCoin Listing Announced, While Shiba Inu and Dogecoin Struggle



                    

Junkyard Cat (JUNKCAT) could turn early investors into multi-millionaires if it becomes a mainstream coin, like Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE).



Junkyard Cat (JUNKCAT), a new Solana memecoin that was launched this week, is poised to explode over 14,000% in price in the coming days.




This is because JUNKCAT has announced its first centralized exchange listing, which will be on KuCoin.



This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up.



Currently, Junkyard Cat can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jupiter and Raydium, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days.




Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Junkyard Cat could become the next viral memecoin.



Junkyard Cat launched with over $6,000 of locked liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains.



To buy Junkyard Cat on Raydium or Jupiter ahead of the KuCoin listing, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Junkyard Cat by entering its contract address – 6AdCuXXoxVMzPnczLjgqC9nQSBtcXnffVvRs8JsQvHhM – in the receiving field.



In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price.




If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner.



The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum.



This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like JUNKCAT.

US Crypto ETFs Expected to Soar Next Year Following Ethereum ETF Approval - Coincu



	

Key Points:




The U.S. SEC approved spot Ethereum ETFs, following earlier approval of Bitcoin ETFs.



Experts predict the introduction of ETFs with a basket of US crypto ETFs, potentially including Bitcoin and Ether, within a year.



Despite the approvals, the SEC Chair emphasized continued strict regulation.




The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) recently approved spot Ethereum ETFs, surprising many with the swiftness of the decision.





Experts Predict Broader US Crypto ETF Offerings Within a Year



The approval follows closely on the heels of Bitcoin ETFs, which were given the nod earlier this year. According to TD Cowen’s research group, this rapid approval was somewhat unexpected but ultimately seen as inevitable once US crypto ETFs received the green light, The Block reported.



Jaret Seiberg of TD Cowen’s Washington Research Group noted that this approval arrived about six months earlier than anticipated. He speculated that the next development could be the introduction of ETFs containing a basket of U.S. crypto assets, likely featuring Bitcoin and Ether, within the next year.



Despite the approval, it is important to note that only the 19b-4 listing requests for Ethereum ETFs have been approved, not the critical S-1 registration statements. The distinction was highlighted by British multinational bank Standard Chartered. Geoffrey Kendrick, the bank’s head of crypto research, believes that it is only a matter of time before other US crypto ETFs, such as XRP and SOL, are approved.




SEC Maintains Tough Stance on Crypto Regulation and Enforcement



However, the approval of Ethereum ETFs does not signify a broader change in the SEC’s stance on cryptocurrencies. SEC Chair Gary Gensler, speaking at the Investment Company Institute 2024 Leadership Summit in Washington DC on May 23, reaffirmed the SEC’s commitment to strict legal adherence regarding crypto ETF applications.



Gensler also highlighted the agency’s robust performance in court cases involving crypto players, including enforcement actions against majors like Binance, Coinbase, and Kraken for alleged securities law violations.



Despite potential challenges, TD Cowen forecasts that the SEC will maintain its Democratic majority through 2026. They predict continued litigation against crypto trading platforms that the SEC deems to be trading unregistered securities.

Donald Trump's Crypto Support Shows Strong With Latest Statements - Coincu



	

Key Points:




Donald Trump’s crypto support is showing strong opposition to President Biden’s stance.



Trump’s campaign is accepting crypto donations, and he pledged to commute Silk Road founder Ross Ulbricht’s sentence if re-elected.




Former President Donald Trump made his strongest endorsement of cryptocurrency to date in a post on Truth Social today.





Donald Trump’s Crypto Support Confirmed During Presidential Campaign



Trump declared, “I am very positive and open-minded to cryptocurrency companies and all things related to this new and burgeoning industry,” indicating a strategic move to garner support from pro-crypto voters.



In his post, Trump contrasted his stance with that of President Joe Biden, asserting that Biden aims to “die a slow and painful death” for the crypto industry. Trump‘s remarks mark a significant shift from his earlier skepticism about cryptocurrencies. In a 2021 interview with Fox Business, he expressed a preference for the U.S. dollar over Bitcoin and called for strict regulation of digital currencies.



Donald Trump’s crypto support has been evident in his recent actions and statements. Earlier this month, he voiced pro-crypto sentiments at a Mar-a-Lago dinner and subsequently announced that his presidential campaign would accept cryptocurrency donations, becoming the first major party candidate to do so.




This pro-crypto rhetoric appears to be influencing the broader political landscape. The Biden administration, historically opposed to cryptocurrency, has shown signs of softening its stance. Last week, the White House did not threaten to veto a crypto market structure bill passed by the House of Representatives. Additionally, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) approved key regulatory filings for ether exchange-traded funds, a move considered improbable just a month ago.



Trump Pledges Support for Silk Road Founder



In another significant announcement, Trump pledged to commute the life sentence of Silk Road founder Ross Ulbricht if re-elected. “If you vote for me, on Day 1, I will commute the sentence of Ross Ulbricht to a sentence of time served,” Trump stated during his remarks at the Libertarian National Convention in Washington, D.C.



Donald Trump’s crypto support and his pledges to reform regulations are expected to garner a lot of interest and support from the cryptocurrency community as the 2024 election draws near.

Stronger and More Sustainable Uptrend Now in Play for Bitcoin (BTC), Says Crypto Analyst - Here’s His Outlook - The Daily Hodl


								A widely followed crypto strategist thinks that Bitcoin (BTC) is in a position to ignite a breakout rally on the way to fresh all-time highs over the next few days.
In a new video update, pseudonymous analyst Credible tells his 53,200 YouTube subscribers that Bitcoin may have just started a five-wave rally that could send BTC above $100,000.










Credible relies on the Elliott Wave theory, which states that a bullish asset often witnesses a five-wave surge where waves one, three and five are upside moves and waves two and four are corrective periods.
According to the analyst, Bitcoin’s recent move from $60,000 to above $70,000 may have been the first wave of the rally with the correction down to $66,000 serving as the wave-two correction.
“Now that we can confirm that this first leg is done, what we’re seeing now is the wave-two correction. What follows the wave-two correction, regardless of how deep it goes, is a much larger wave three, four and a five. 
If our first wave up went from $60,000 to $70,000, that’s a $10,000 move, the third [wave] is typically larger than that and the fifth is equivalent…
Bottom line though is wherever this wave two ends, we can expect at least $20,000 of further upside from wherever this correction ends. If this correction ends at $66,000, then we’re looking at a minimum of $86,000 for this next completed impulse to the upside.
More likely that’s going to push into the $90,000s, potentially the $100,000 level.”
Source: Credible/YouTube
Credible also believes that the rally will be a “much more sustainable and stronger uptrend” for BTC.
At time of writing, Bitcoin is trading for $69,204, a fractional increase in the past day.

Donald Trump's CBDC Stance Now Reaffirmed Though Crypto Support Strengthens - Coincu



	

Key Points:




Former US President Donald Trump vows to block the creation of a Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC).



Donald Trump’s CBDC stance aligns himself with critics, including Florida Governor Ron DeSantis, amidst growing political discourse on the issue.



Despite past skepticism, Trump pledges support for the US’s dominance in cryptocurrency.




Former US President Donald Trump made a bold assertion during a recent electoral event, declaring his staunch opposition to establishing a Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC). 





Donald Trump’s CBDC Stance: Promises to Halt Release



Trump expressed concerns about the potential infringement on individual freedoms posed by CBDCs, aligning himself with other critics of this emerging financial technology.



In a public speech, Trump emphasized his determination to prevent the creation of a CBDC, stating, “I will keep Elizabeth Warren and her goons away from your Bitcoin, and I will never allow the creation of a Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC).” Donald Trump’s CBDC stance echoes the sentiments of Florida Governor Ron DeSantis and adds Trump’s voice to the growing chorus of CBDC skeptics in the political arena.



Along with Donald Trump’s CBDC stance, a report from Bank of America in November expressed skepticism about the short-term issuance of a digital US dollar by the Federal Reserve. During his campaign speech in Laconia, New Hampshire, in January, Trump also voiced opposition to digital currencies issued by individual central banks.




Former President Pledges Crypto Support



Additionally, he pledged to support the US’s dominance in the crypto space, stating, “I will ensure that the future of crypto and Bitcoin will be made in the USA…I will support the right to self custody to the nation’s 50 million crypto holders. “



It’s worth noting that despite his previous criticisms of cryptocurrencies, Trump disclosed ownership of over $2.5 million in Ether in August 2023. Moreover, his presidential campaign announced plans to accept cryptocurrency donations to mobilize a “crypto army” leading up to Election Day.

Why Polygon [MATIC] is on track for a price rise - AMBCrypto



Increased Invested Age and other metrics suggested that most MATIC holders were opting to HODL.
High areas of liquidity existed between $0.75 and $0.78, indicating that the price could move towards these zones.

Contrary to what was happening with other groups, Polygon [MATIC] addresses holding 100 million to 1 billion tokens have been added to their balance.
This was according to data provided by Santiment. According to the on-chain analytic platform, the supply held by this cohort was 16.17% on the 23rd of May.
But as of this writing, the percentage had increased to 17.30%.
Skeptics are no longer in town
This increase denotes increasing confidence in the long-term potential of the token. However, it could also impact MATIC’s price action in the short term.
For instance, if whales (the term for the group mentioned) decide to distribute a large part of their holdings, the token involved could experience a price decrease.
Therefore, the increase in balance has the potential to drive Polygon’s price higher. At press time, the price of the token was $0.72. This was a 25.48% decline in the last 90 days.
Source: Santiment
However, MATIC has been trying to trade higher within the last month. But every attempt to reach and surpass the $0.80 resistance, has been met with rejection.
But with the recent accumulation, it could be possible for the Polygon native token to climb. Concerning this potential, AMBCrypto evaluated other metrics and indicators to see if they agreed.
One of the indicators we looked at was the liquidation levels. This indicator shows the price levels a cryptocurrency can reach by highlighting high areas of liquidity.
As of this writing, high liquidity on the Polygon chart existed between $0.75 and $0.78. This magnetic zone indicated that the token might soon start moving in that direction.
The season of respite is coming
On the same plot, the Cumulative Liquidation Levels Delta (CLLD) validated the prediction. For context, the CLLD shows the difference between long and short liquidations.
Positive readings of the indicator suggest more long liquidations than shorts. On the other hand, a negative reading of the CLLD means that there are more short liquidations than longs.
Source: Hyblock
Apart from this, the indicator influences the price action. At press time, it was negative. For Polygon’s price, this indicated that a sharp recovery could be close, and late shorts trying to catch the dip might get punished.
Furthermore, the Mean Dollar Invested Age (MDIA) indicated that most participants had leaned toward HODLing MATIC. The metric shows the average time all current Polygon addresses have held their tokens.

Read Polygon’s [MATIC] Price Prediction 2024-2025

If the reading of the MDIA decreases it indicates increasing transaction activity. Sometimes, this could fuel selling pressure. At press time, the 90-day MDIA increased.
Source: Santiment
The last time, the metric made such a consistent move, MATIC went from $0.71 to $1.27. While this might not be the same case this time, the price of the token might close in or surpass $1 in the midterm.

Ethereum and Bitcoin Correlation: Will Ether Price Pick Up Pace?

After the SEC approved Ethereum ETFs on Thursday, March 23, Ether has yet to show signs of growth. For Bitcoin, it took almost a month after the ETF approval before the price could set on a massive bull run, reaching an all-time-high of $73,738.00 on March 14.In September 2022, Ethereum moved to proof of stake (PoS), a set of interconnected upgrades that made Ethereum more secure and sustainable. Proof of stake substitutes computational power with staking (making it less energy-intensive) and replaces miners with validators, who stake their cryptocurrency holdings to activate the ability to create new blocks.The growing popularity of Ether dApps prompts traders to diversify their portfolios. A closer look at the BTC/ETH correlation could hint the possibility of the Ethereum price finally picking up the pace.BTC/ETH correlation coefficientThe BTC/ETH correlation refers to the price relationship between Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH), typically expressed in terms of BTC. For example, if Bitcoin is priced at $60,000 and Ethereum at $3,000, the ratio is 0.05, meaning it costs 0.05 BTC to buy one ETH. If ETH's price increases faster than BTC's, the ratio rises, indicating it costs more BTC to buy ETH.Source: IntoTheBlockAnother measure of this relationship is the correlation coefficient, ranging from -1 to 1. A coefficient of 1 indicates that BTC and ETH move in the same direction, -1 indicates they move in opposite directions, and 0 signifies no correlation. For instance, during periods of negative correlation, if BTC's price rises, ETH's price would fall, and vice versa.Thus, the BTC/ETH correlation shows the price relationship between the two assets, while the correlation coefficient measures how their prices move relative to each other. Both metrics are crucial for efficiently trading the BTC/ETH correlation.Historic correlationHistorical data shows that Ethereum tends to be priced higher during bull markets. For instance, ETH was priced above 0.05 BTC during the bull runs of 2018 and 2021. After 2021, the 0.05 BTC level has consistently served as a strong support region. Conversely, the 0.08 BTC level has acted as significant resistance on three separate occasions.During the BTC bull run, the correlation had been steadily growing, peaking on March 14, when the BTC price reached an ATH.Source: IntoTheBlockThe graph indicates that Ethereum outperforms Bitcoin in bull markets and underperforms in bear markets. While past performance does not guarantee future results, it provides valuable insights for making more informed decisions.A recent Coinbase report shows that the correlation between Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) has been declining since early 2023, particularly after Ethereum's Shanghai (Shapella) hard fork on April 12, which enabled staked ether withdrawals. This change has reduced the 40-day rolling correlation from 0.95 to 0.82.Historically, BTC and ETH have moved together, but factors such as the rising adoption of Ethereum-based decentralized applications (dApps), the popularity of non-fungible tokens (NFTs) and Ethereum's shift to a proof-of-stake (PoS) consensus mechanism are driving the divergence.Ethereum ETFs expectationsAccording to IntoTheBlock's research, 95% of current ETH positions are now profitable, with its price increasing by 30% over the past seven days. This level of profitability has not been observed since November 2021, when ETH prices soared to an all-time high.There is minimal resistance to the volume of ETH purchased at prices higher than current levels. Specifically, 3.57 million ETH were bought in the price range of $3,800 to $4,800, compared to 53.54 million ETH purchased between $2,160 and $2,650.ETH whales have also begun to make significant moves, following the increased odds of ETF approval. On Tuesday the 21st, ETH recorded an on-chain trading volume of $15.98 billion, marking the highest volume recorded since June 13, 2022.Of the $15.98 billion in trading volume recorded, $14.33 billion came from transactions exceeding $100,000, typically conducted by whales. This represents 90% of the total traded volume for this day. This trend could be expected to accelerate now that the ETFs have indeed been approved.The approval of the ETH ETFs marks a significant milestone in cryptocurrency acceptance, likely influencing increased activity among ETH whales as reflected by recent large-volume transactions. The shifting landscape, underscored by substantial on-chain trading volumes, suggests a growing institutional and investor confidence in Ethereum.

Bitcoin Evangelist Saylor Warms Up to Ethereum


During a recent appearance on the "What Bitcoin Did" podcast, MicroStrategy co-founder Michael Saylor spoke positively about Ethereum exchange-traded funds, predicting that they will help accelerate institutional adoption. Mainstream investors might be willing to allocate a higher percentage of their portfolios (from 5% to 10%) instead of just 1% now that view crypto as a broader asset class. Saylor is convinced that Bitcoin is going to account for up to 70% of that allocation as the leader of the crypto asset class. "In fact, it might be better for Bitcoin because we are politically much more powerful…supported by the entire cryptocurrency industry…They obviously have a lot of political power, a lot of users, and they serve as another line of defense for Bitcoin," he said. In a stunning U-turn, several 19b-4s listing requests filed by Ethereum ETF issuers were approved earlier this week. Just days before that, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission was predicted to reject them due to the lack of engagement, political pressure, and the uncertainty surrounding the legal status of the underlying Ether token. Bloomberg ETF expert James Seyffart believes that Ethereum ETFs will be able to reach roughly 25% of the demand for the Bitcoin ETFs that went live in January. For now, it is unclear when these Ethereum ETFs will actually start trading since the SEC also has to approve corresponding S-1 registration statements.Saylor has now changed his tune after previously predicting that Ethereum would never be accepted by Wall Street since it is very "clear" that the flagship altcoin is a security. He claimed that Bitcoin was the only "institutional grade crypto asset."

Bloomberg Analyst Predicts Ethereum Spot ETFs To Attract 25% Of BTC Demand - Here’s Why


																Following the sudden approval of the Ethereum Spot ETF last week, speculations continue to roll in on the potential performance of these funds ahead of their debut trading session. Most recently, renowned Bloomberg ETF analyst, James Seyffart has weighed in on the subject giving his thoughts on the possible level of investments the Ethereum spot ETFs could pull in relation to their Bitcoin-based equivalents.

ETH Spot ETF Limited By Ethereum’s Utility And Other Factors – Analyst
In an interview session on X on May 24 hosted by Bitwise Chief Investment Officer Matt Hougan, Seyffart stated that the Ether spot ETFs would likely experience a maximum of 25% of the demand seen by the Bitcoin spot ETFs.
Seyffart based his predictions on multiple elements starting with enormous differences in market caps between both assets. According to data from CoinMarket, Ethereum’s total market shares are valued at $449.25 billion which is roughly equal to 30% of BTC’s 1.35 trillion market cap.
Furthermore, the analyst also highlighted the large disparities in the difference between both ETFs and their base assets. According to Seyffart, there is a bigger gap between Ethereum as an ETF and as a cryptocurrency than Bitcoin as an ETF and as itself. 
The ETF analyst believes that the ETH spot ETFs will limit investors from native ETF features such as staking, a prominent source of passive income, and other on-chain use cases in terms of DeFi, NFTs, DAOs, etc. Thus, certain investors might prefer to invest directly in the altcoin. 
With all these factors in consideration, Seyffart predicts these novel investment funds will produce “big launches” but not at the level of the Bitcoin spot ETFs.  He predicts the Ethereum Spot ETFs will record between 20-25% of investments in their Bitcoin-based peers once trading commences. Meanwhile, fellow Bloomberg analyst Eric Balchunas appears less optimistic with a projection of 15-20%.
Undoubtedly, the performance of the Ethereum spot ETFs will be influential on other crypto spot ETFs that may gain approval from the US Securities and Exchange Commission. Currently, the XRP ETF is tipped by many enthusiasts as the next debutant in the market but this is still subject to many factors, most especially regulatory clarity on the institutional sales of XRP.
Ethereum Price Overview
In other news, Ethereum is trading at $3,766 with a 0.51% gain in the last day. This slight positive performance underscores Ethereum’s form all week with a combined 20.47% gain recorded in the last seven days. Meanwhile, ETH’s daily trading volume is down by 51.27% and is valued at $10.03 billion.

Donald Trump Promises Total Support For Bitcoin and Crypto If Re-elected - Coin Edition


							

Donald Trump has promised to support Bitcoin and cryptocurrency if re-elected.
Trump said he would not allow the U.S. to create a CBDC.
The former president promised to commute Ross Ulbricht’s sentence to time served.
﻿




Former U.S. President Donald Trump has promised to support Bitcoin and cryptocurrency if re-elected in the forthcoming presidential election. According to Trump, “Bitcoin will be made in the USA, not driven overseas.”







Continuing his campaign speech, Trump promised to support the right to self-custody and keep the well-known anti-crypto senator, Elizabeth Warren, away from the nation’s 50 million crypto holders. Trump further promised never to allow the creation of a central bank digital currency (CBDC).









Meanwhile, the recent campaign speech is not Trump’s first Bitcoin-appeal campaign move. The former president is renowned for repeatedly promising to support the cryptocurrency industry if re-elected. In one of his posts on Truth Social, an alternative social media platform, Trump expressed positivity and open-mindedness to cryptocurrency companies. 



The former president claimed to support “all things related to the new and burgeoning industry,” noting that the U.S. must be the leader in the cryptocurrency field. He accused the current president, Joe Biden, of wanting cryptocurrency to die a slow and painful death, describing him as the worst president in the country’s history.



Trump also made another landmark pledge to the crypto community by promising to free the Silk Road creator, Ross Ulbricht, if re-elected. The court sentenced Ulbricht to two life sentences plus 40 years for creating the darknet marketplace. 



In his campaign speech, Trump pledged to commute Ulbricht’s sentence to the time served, as the audience, many of whom held up signs reading “Free Ross” cheered along. The court sentenced Ulbricht in 2015 after determining that the darknet he created anonymously used to buy and sell illegal goods, including drugs. He has served 11 years of his lifetime sentence as of filing this report.

Donald Trump Declares Support For Cryptocurrency Companies - Details


								



Former US President and Republican Presidential candidate Donald Trump has pledged to support cryptocurrency companies if re-elected. This announcement comes as the American billionaire challenges incumbent President Joe Biden, whose administration seems to be reversing its stance on crypto policy. With the US Presidential elections nearing later this year, the contrasting approaches to cryptocurrency regulation are becoming a significant point of contention.





US Should Lead Global Crypto Space – Donald Trump
In a post on self-owned social media platform Truth Social, Donald Trump made a personal declaration in support of the digital asset industry. The former US president expressed his openness to the potential of cryptocurrency while also advocating leadership in this nascent industry. 
Statements from Trump’s post shared on X by Founder of blockchain research firm Messari, Ryan Selkis, read: 
I am very positive and open minded to cryptocurrency companies, and all things related to this new and burgeoning industry. Our country must be the leader in the field. There is no second place.
Donald Trump also took a swipe at incumbent President Joe Biden who he accused of being against the crypto industry. He also suggested that his administration would engage the industry differently to ensure its development. 
Trump said: 
Crooked Joe Biden, on the other hand, the worst president in the history of our country, wants it (crypto industry) to die a slow and painful death. That will never happen with me.  
These statements by Donald Trump are largely unsurprising as the Republican has always been a subtle supporter of the novel digital asset industry which is stuck in a regulatory tussle with the current US government.
A month after declaring his presidential ambition in 2022, Trump announced a limited edition of 44,000 non-fungible tokens which depicted him in multiple figures including a sheriff, an astronaut, etc. The NFT collection sold out in less than a day for a combined value of about $4.4 million. 
Most recently, Donald Trump’s campaign also started receiving donations in multiple cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin (BTC), Ether (ETH), and the US Dollar Coin (USDC). These actions coupled with the billionaire’s recent statement indicate a glaring support for digital assets which may prove pivotal in the forthcoming elections.


Is Biden Seeking ‘Crypto Votes’?
According to data from Triple-A, The US is home to 46 million active adult crypto users who will be looking to have a say at the polls, especially with the lack of clear regulations and consistent crackdowns targeted at US crypto space. 
In light of this situation, it appears the current US government could be implementing a change in policy on cryptocurrency following the sudden approval of the Ethereum ETFs by the US Securities and Exchange Commission against general market sentiment. 
Furthermore, the US House of Representatives has also passed the Financial Innovation and Technology for the 21st Century Act (FIT),  which faced opposition from the White House but with no threats of a veto. So far, these actions have been widely interpreted as political acts by the current administration targeted at winning favors in the upcoming elections.

SEC Approves Spot Ether ETFs: A Different Path from Bitcoin ETFs



                    

On May 23, the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) approved spot Ether exchange-traded funds (ETFs), marking a notable difference from the approval of spot Bitcoin ETFs in January. 



Unlike the Bitcoin ETFs, which were approved via voting by a five-member committee including SEC chief Gary Gensler, the spot Ether ETFs were approved by the SEC’s Trading and Markets Division.




The SEC greenlit the 19b-4 filings from several firms including BlackRock, Fidelity, Grayscale, Bitwise, VanEck, Ark, Invesco Galaxy, and Franklin Templeton. 



The Commission did not provide additional comments beyond the official decision. 



The official filing stated: “For the Commission, by the Division of Trading and Markets, pursuant to delegated authority.”




While the crypto community questioned the differing approval processes, Bloomberg ETF analyst James Seyffart explained it as a routine procedure. 



He noted that many approvals are typically handled in this manner and requiring an official vote for every decision would be impractical. Seyffart added, “It would have been nice to see where the political lines were drawn.”

However, some individuals remain skeptical of Seyffart’s assessment. 




One user on X pointed out that a commissioner could still challenge the decision within the next 10 days, suggesting that delegated authority might be used to obscure potentially politically charged votes.



Another user on X speculated that the SEC’s decision was influenced by various factors, including political pressure, upcoming elections, and the implementation of environmental, social, and governance (ESG) rules.



A significant difference between the approval processes for the two crypto ETFs is the timeline for trading. 



All 11 Bitcoin ETFs began trading the day after their approval, as they also received S-1 form clearance. 



In contrast, spot Ether ETFs might take weeks or months to debut on exchanges since the ETF filers have not yet received the S-1 SEC registration.



Overall, the approval of spot Ether ETFs marks another step forward in the crypto market, albeit with procedural differences and potential political undercurrents.

Bitcoin Whitepaper Re-Uploaded After Craig Wright Loses Satoshi Nakamoto Claims - Coin Edition


							

Cobra has re-uploaded the Bitcoin whitepaper on Bitcoin.org.
The anonymous team pulled down the whitepaper in 2021 following Craig Wright’s lawsuit.
The UK High Court has determined that Craig Wright is not Satoshi Nakamoto.




Cobra, the anonymous team behind the Bitcoin.org website, has re-uploaded the Bitcoin whitepaper on its platform following Craig Wright’s failure to prove to the court that he is Satoshi Nakamoto, the pseudonymous creator of the flagship crypto. In March, a High Court in the UK ruled Wright is not Satoshi, with one judge concluding that he lied extensively, engaged in technobabble, and isn’t as clever as he thinks.









Bitcoin.org pulled down the PDF copy of the Bitcoin whitepaper on its platform in 2021, following a court order after Wright successfully sued Cobra for copyright infringement. Wright won the 2021 lawsuit after the anonymous group failed to appear in court not to jeopardize their anonymity. Hence, Wright’s victory was by default, with Cobra having to refund his legal fees worth $41,000.



Last Thursday, Bitcoin.org’s maintainer, Hennadii Stepanov, shared a link to the Bitcoin whitepaper PDF on X, marking a return of the document on the platform. Stepanov’s action followed a reversal of Wright’s temporary victory and a series of protests from several sectors of the Bitcoin community.







In a significant turn of events, several publishers shared the Bitcoin whitepaper on their platforms after Bitcoin.org pulled it down. The publishers protested despite Wright’s threat to sue anyone who published the document. A Bitcoin community member shared a list of over 100 websites that published the document.  





Three years after the Wright’s victory, the court determined his inability to prove that he was Bitcoin’s pseudonymous creator, putting to rest an argument that has lasted several years. Hence, Cobra re-uploaded the novel technology’s whitepaper to the original platform where it was first published.

These Are This Week's Top Performers as Bitcoin (BTC) Price Maintains $69K (Weekend Watch)


																Bitcoin, alongside the rest of the market, had a highly beneficial week driven by the hype and the actual approval of spot Ethereum ETFs in the United States.
The weekly scale shows that UNI, PEPE, LDO, and ETH are among the leaders in terms of gains from the larger-cap alts.
BTC’s Weekly Surge
It was last Sunday when the primary cryptocurrency struggled to remain above $66,000 and slipped beneath that level on a few occasions. Monday started on a similar note but its end was nothing short than spectacular.
Amid reports that the US SEC might approve eight spot Ethereum ETFs that week, BTC skyrocketed by over five grand and neared $72,000 for the first time in six weeks. Nevertheless, the asset failed to maintain its run and started losing value in the following days.
The worst price drop came just hours before the US securities regulator indeed greenlighted those financial products on Thursday and BTC decreased to $66,400. Yet, it bounced off and soared to $69,000 by Friday.


Thanks for subscribing, you will get your first report in the next hours!


The weekend has gone quite calmly but bitcoin has managed to defend the $69,000 level. Its market cap stands close to $1.370 trillion, while its dominance over the alts is at 50.3%.

PEPE’s Week
Somewhat expected, the news mentioned above impacted Ethereum’s native token a lot. ETH went on a roll and shot up from $3,100 to over $3,900, which became its highest price tag since the start of April. The second-largest crypto also went on a volatile ride amid the SEC’s approval but now stands close to $3,800 after gaining 22% in the past week.
DOGE, LINK, and APT have also jumped impressively on a weekly scale, but Uniswap and PEPE lead the charts. UNI has skyrocketed by 44% and stands above $11, while PEPE painted several all-time highs this week.
In contrast, SOL, TRX, TON, and ADA are in the red on a weekly scale. Still, the total crypto market cap gained more than $200 billion within this timeframe and is now above $2.7 trillion.

NY AG Issues Warning for Crypto Companies


New York Attorney General Letitia James has warned the cryptocurrency industry that she will go after those companies that refuse to play by the same rules as everyone else.Earlier this week, James announced a $2 billion settlement with embattled cryptocurrency lender Genesis. She decried the lack of oversight that had led to massive losses for victims.Gemini, Genesis and the Digital Currency Group were sued by the NYAG back in October 2023 over the controversial Gemini Earn cryptocurrency investment program. The fraud loss claim against Barry Silvert's crypto giant was then tripled in February in an amended complaint.As part of the settlement, Genesis has been prohibited from operating in New York.In 2018, James was elected as the state's attorney general with overwhelming support, breaking gender and racial barriers.Since her historic election, James has cracked down on various cryptocurrency companies.In April 2019, New York's top law enforcement official kicked off a long-running legal battle with stablecoin issuer Tether and cryptocurrency exchange Bitfinex. In February 2021, it eventually reached an agreement with James with a $18.5 million fine.Since then, the NYAG has also taken action against such cryptocurrency firms as Coinseed.In December 2023, cryptocurrency exchange KuCoin agreed to shell out a total of $22 million.Crypto lobbying boomWith growing regulatory scrutiny, cryptocurrency firms have also intensified their lobbying efforts. Over the past four years, cryptocurrency firms have spent $149 million to elect potential allies in Congress, according to a recent report by the Washington Post.

Ethereum Spot ETF: Experts Weigh In On ETH Selling Point Post-ETF Approval | Bitcoinist.com


								In an interesting turn of events, the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) approved the pending Ethereum spot ETF applications last week. This landmark development has led to commentary on the value and acceptability of the Ether token, especially amongst a specific demographic.
If Bitcoin Is Digital Gold, What Is Ethereum?
Eric Balchunas, an ETF analyst at Bloomberg, took to the X platform to discuss the chances of success of the Ethereum spot ETF market following the recent approval. The analyst highlighted how the acceptability of the Ethereum token, especially amongst investors in the 60 to 80-year-old age group (baby boomers), might pose a challenge to how well the investment products will perform.

According to Balchunas, one way ETF issuers might be able to penetrate the “baby boomer” market is by distilling the value or purpose of the ETH ETFs into an “easy-to-understand sound bite.” The Bloomberg analyst questioned if Ethereum has a simple selling point while citing “Bitcoin is digital gold” as an exemplary marketing one-liner that the older generation can resonate with.
Balchunas then asked in his post:
Does a simple one-liner like that exist for Ether? If so, what is it?
There were several interesting answers from notable personalities in the cryptocurrency space. Notably, crypto journalist Colin Wu called Ethereum the “Web 3.0 internet.” 
Prominent crypto investor and partner at venture capital firm Cinneamhain Ventures Adam Cochran also responded, saying “Ethereum is like digital oil.” Cochran explained further that Ethereum is the gas that powers decentralized protocols. 


Meanwhile, James Check (popularly known as CheckMatey), a lead analyst at Glassnode, suggested that Ether doesn’t have a selling point. “Ethereum still has no elevator pitch, despite years of attempts,” the crypto pundit said in a post on X.
ETH ETF To Clear The Path For More Funds: TD Cowen
While it is unclear whether the Ethereum spot ETFs will be successful, these newly approved funds are expected to usher in even newer crypto products in the coming year. According to investment bank TD Cowen’s research team, a product containing a “basket of crypto tokens,” possibly just Bitcoin and Ether or other tokens might be next in line.

However, the research group noted in its report that the recent approval of Ethereum spot ETF doesn’t indicate a shift in the SEC’s overall stance towards crypto. This was highlighted in chairman Gary Gensler’s recent statement against the passage of crypto legislation.


“We expect the agency will continue to litigate against crypto trading platforms that trade tokens that the agency believes are unregistered securities,” the TD Cowen researchers said about the SEC keeping its Democratic majority through 2026.

Dogecoin (DOGE) Just Beat Ethereum, Shiba Inu and Others in 24 Hours: Details

Dogecoin has regained some major amount of power and successfully moved toward the $0.17 price level, now showing the strongest performance across the market, even beating Ethereum and Shiba Inu. Over the past 24 hours, DOGE's impressive rally has caught the attention of many investors, making it one of the top-performing cryptocurrencies in the market.Some of the reasons for the recent surge of Dogecoin are new retail interest and buying volumes. This resultantly increases the buying activity on the asset, hence creating high volatility in the price of DOGE.Dogecoin/USDT Chart by TradingViewDogecoin has now first broken above the 50 EMA, indicating a bullish trend. The relative strength indicator also points to the current wave on the bull side, therefore further gains being expected in the short term. In addition, the increased volume has reflected high buying pressure.On the other hand, Ethereum and Shiba Inu have not done nearly as well. Ethereum has been pretty stable in gaining a bit, while Shiba Inu has been struggling with an attempt to break out of its current price range. It was all the more interesting with the fact that Dogecoin continued outperforming even these two big digital coins.Another fueling factor for the surge in Dogecoin is positivity in the entire crypto market. With Bitcoin and other major cryptos showing signs of recovery, investors seem to be more ready to take risks on alternative coins like DOGE, and this restored confidence has really hyped its price.There will be room to stretch closer to the key resistance levels if the current momentum persists and bulls stay on Dogecoin's side. One way or another, any kind of meme coin is volatile, not excluding Dogecoin. Stay cautious and try avoiding overleveraging and poor risk management.

Altcoins Entering ‘Textbook Markup’ Period Witnessed During 2016 and 2021 Market Cycles, Says Analyst - The Daily Hodl


								An analyst known for making macro crypto calls thinks the altcoin market is poised to spark steep rallies similar to the ones witnessed in 2016 and 2021.
Pseudonymous analyst TechDev tells his 451,900 followers on the social media platform X that he’s watching the OTHERS chart, which tracks the total market cap of crypto excluding the 10-largest digital assets and stablecoins.










According to the crypto strategist, OTHERS appears to be following a “textbook” bullish formation after breaking out from a rounding bottom pattern.
“Alts are entering textbook markup.” 
Source: TechDev/X
Looking at the trader’s chart, OTHERS seems to have printed the exact same pattern seen during the 2016 bull market cycle. The TOTAL3 chart, which tracks the total market cap of crypto excluding Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH) and stablecoins, also generated the same pattern in 2021 before launching a big burst to the upside.
Based on the chart, TechDev predicts that OTHERS will rally to as high as $1 trillion during its markup phase. At time of writing, OTHERS is hovering at $291.35 billion, suggesting an upside potential of more than 243% if it hits TechDev’s target.
The analyst is also looking at other relevant charts to support his bullish stance on altcoins. According to TechDev, both the Bitcoin dominance (BTC.D) and Tether dominance (USDT.D) charts are flashing bearish signals.
Bitcoin dominance tracks how much of the crypto market cap belongs to BTC while Tether dominance measures how much of the crypto market cap belongs to USDT. If both charts are bearish, it suggests that traders are moving their capital to altcoins.
“Bitcoin dominance is breaking down from a massive distribution. Tether dominance is marking down in the acceleration phase of its distribution. Alts haven’t expanded from this level of macro compression since Dec 2020. The next narrative is around the corner.” 
TechDev says the narrative that could ignite an altcoin surge is the launch of spot market Ethereum exchange-traded funds.
“Cue the next alt narrative right on time. ETH ETF.”

Bitcoin Price Prediction

Bitcoin (BTC/USD) is currently trading at $69,088, reflecting a slight decline of 0.33%, signalling a bearish Bitcoin price prediction. The green line, which represents the pivot point at $68,747, is a crucial level for determining the next price movement.
Immediate resistance is at $70,000, followed by $71,500 and $73,000. On the downside, immediate support is at $68,500, with further support levels at $67,000 and $65,900.


The Relative Strength Index (RSI) stands at 56.26, indicating neutral momentum. The 50-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA) is at $68,747, suggesting that this level provides significant support.
Bitcoin Price Prediction
Given the current price action around the pivot point, traders should watch for a break above $70,000 for a bullish continuation, targeting $71,500 and $73,000.
Conversely, a drop below $68,500 could lead to further declines towards $67,000 and $65,900. The RSI and EMA indicate a neutral trend, so careful monitoring of these levels is advised for potential trading opportunities.

Solana (SOL) on Verge of Reversal? $180 Looms Ahead

Solana is preparing for its bounce back as the asset hits the gas pedal near the $170 level, possibly changing the trajectory. Hopefully, the price level mentioned in the heading of this post turns out to be prophetic shortly. Recent price action does seem to suggest that Solana might be preparing for a significant breakout as it tests the $180 level in the near future.Now, turning the light on to technical indicators, there are plenty of buy signals in the price of Solana on the daily chart. The price has held properly on top of the 50-day moving average, which stands as a significant support in an uptrend rally. RSI pointing upward still has room to go until it reaches 70 and currently is above the 50 level, indicating rising buying pressure.SOL/USDT Chart by TradingViewMeanwhile, volume has risen aggressively over the last few days, an indication of growing demand and investor confidence in the future of Solana. The MACD indicator also holds that the bullish signals stay intact as the MACD line travels above the signal line. Of course, the road to $180 will be extremely thorny for Solana, with the first critical resistance lying around $175, where the price has met resistance in the past.If Solana manages to cross this, then the next target becomes the $180 level. If Solana further manages to break this level, then the bull rally might push even even higher to eye the $200 level. Investors have a positive outlook before the Ethereum ETF. The analysts believe that the next in line for an ETF is Solana. But it should be wiser to wait when the confirmation of the Ethereum ETF is here.

US Presidential Candidate Donald Trump's Historic Bitcoin and Cryptocurrency Statements - Hard to Believe Promises, What's Going On? - Bitcoin Sistemi


Former President Donald Trump surprisingly declared his support for the cryptocurrency industry and promised to make the United States a global leader in this field if re-elected.
“The future of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies will be in the United States. I will support the right of self-custody for the country's 50 million crypto holders,” Trump said. He also vowed to keep Senator Elizabeth Warren, a well-known critic of cryptocurrencies, away from Bitcoin.


Directly challenging the current administration's stance on digital currencies, Trump said, “I will never authorize Central Bank Digital Currencies (CBDCs) and will put an end to President Joe Biden's fight to crush crypto.”
In a move that could have significant implications for the crypto world, Trump also said that he would consider the life sentence of Ross Ulbricht, the founder of the Bitcoin-using Silk Road marketplace, served if he returns to the White House. Ulbricht's case had become iconic in the crypto community, which saw him as the victim of harsh punishment for crimes related to the establishment of an online marketplace that used Bitcoin for transactions.






Trump expressed his optimism about the potential of the crypto industry with the following words:

“I am very positive and open-minded towards cryptocurrency companies and everything related to this new and developing industry. Our country should be a leader in this field. There is no second place.”

He finished his statement by directly attacking President Biden, saying, “Biden wants the cryptocurrency industry to die a slow and painful death. That will never happen with me!” said.

Shiba Inu (SHIB) price action has gained attention in recent days as it battled a much-watched key resistance.However, the latest developments indicate a stall in the SHIB rally, prompting a closer examination of market trends, on-chain data and technical indicators.The crux of the SHIB price action is a key price range between $0.000024 and $0.000026, where 58.91 trillion SHIB were bought by 63,840 addresses at an average price of $0.000025, according to IntoTheBlock data.As SHIB approached the 58 trillion token threshold, the momentum that had propelled its price began to wane. This level has become a critical point of resistance, where bullish sentiment started to falter.Shiba Inu steadily declined for three days after reaching highs of $0.00002684 on May 22. Price rebounded before selling resumed with SHIB battling to stay above the daily SMA 50 at $0.0000245 in today's trading session.SHIB/USD Daily Chart, Courtesy: TradingViewAt the time of writing, SHIB was relinquishing its prior day gains, down 0.08% in the last 24 hours to $0.00002482.Although the exact reason for the SHIB price slowdown remains unknown, market dynamics and other factors might have come into play.The slowing at this point might suggest that the market is taking a moment to consolidate gains and consider the next move. Traders may be taking profits, while others could be waiting for a clearer signal to take action. Additionally, the overall sentiment in the crypto market plays a crucial role, as broader market trends often influence the performance of individual tokens.For SHIB to regain its upward momentum, it might likely need to overcome the 58 trillion SHIB threshold with renewed buying interest. The broader market movements may also need to be monitored to determine the SHIB price's next move.If the market regains momentum, a break past the $0.00002684 level might be needed to ascertain the start of a SHIB upside move. If this happens, SHIB might target the $0.00003285 level. In this scenario, SHIB might need to sustain above the daily SMA 50 at $0.0000245 to prevent further declines.If SHIB drops below the daily SMA 50 level, support is envisaged at $0.00002334 and $0.00002155.

Trump: ‘I Will Never Allow the Creation of a Central Bank Digital Currency’ | Cryptoglobe


                                
On Saturday, former U.S. president Donald J. Trump made several pro-crypto comments on his social media platform Truth Social — which is part of the Trump Media & Technology Group (TMTG) and aims to provide an alternative to established social media networks such as Twitter and Facebook — and at a convention.



In this post, Trump Trump expressed strong support for the cryptocurrency industry, declaring himself open-minded and enthusiastic about its potential. He emphasized the importance of the United States leading in this emerging field, dismissing any notion of a secondary position. Contrasting his stance with that of President Joe Biden, whom he harshly criticized as the worst president in the country’s history, Trump accused Biden of attempting to stifle the industry. Trump assured his followers that under his leadership, the crypto sector would thrive and not face the slow demise he attributes to Biden’s policies.







Also, according to a report by CoinDesk, at the Libertarian National Convention in Washington, D.C., Trump criticized Biden’s approach to cryptocurrency and promised to protect the future of crypto and Bitcoin in the U.S. He assured the audience that he would oppose the establishment of a central bank digital currency and support the right to self-custody of digital assets: 



“I will ensure that the future of crypto and the future of bitcoin will be made in the USA, not driven overseas. I will support the right to self custody … To the nation’s fifty million crypto holders, I say this: I will keep Elizabeth Warren and her goons away from your bitcoin, and I will never allow the creation of a central bank digital currency.“







Trump’s recent comments indicate a shift towards a more pro-crypto stance.



Earlier this week, Donald Trump’s campaign introduced a fundraising page allowing donors to contribute using cryptocurrency through the Coinbase Commerce platform. This initiative marks a significant milestone as the first instance of a major party presidential nominee accepting cryptocurrency donations, thereby broadening the campaign’s digital fundraising strategies.







            
            

            
            

            
            

        

The campaign assures that all contributions will adhere to Federal Election Commission regulations, including limits and disclosure requirements. Supporters can now make compliant cryptocurrency donations at Trump Campaign Crypto Donations. Accepted cryptocurrencies include Bitcoin, Ethereum, XRP, Dogecoin, Shiba Inu, USD Coin, Solana, and 0x.



In a blog post, the campaign highlighted Trump’s efforts to reduce regulations and promote innovation in financial technology during his presidency, contrasting these policies with those of Democratic leaders like Joe Biden and Senator Elizabeth Warren, who are depicted as favoring increased government control over financial systems.



The campaign positions this move as part of a broader effort to enhance individual financial freedom and reduce governmental oversight. They assert that this announcement demonstrates Trump’s commitment to prioritizing personal liberty over “government control.”



Elizabeth Warren has been vocal about her concerns regarding cryptocurrency, reportedly aiming to build an “anti-crypto army” to impose stricter regulations. In contrast, Trump’s campaign is rallying supporters to form a “crypto army” to support the campaign leading up to the election on 5 November 2024.



According to CNBC, this strategy could provide a new stream of funds for Trump’s campaign, which, despite raising more money than Biden’s in April, still has less cash on hand. The report notes that Biden’s campaign remains skeptical of cryptocurrency, reflecting the administration’s cautious stance. Just before Trump’s campaign started appealing to crypto donors, Biden’s team issued a fundraising message warning that “cryptocurrency executives and oil barons are coming out of the woodwork for Trump.”



While Trump’s campaign claims he is the first major party nominee to embrace crypto donations, CNBC points out that he is not yet the official nominee. Additionally, Trump is not the first presidential candidate to accept cryptocurrency; Robert F. Kennedy Jr., running as an independent, began accepting bitcoin donations in May 2023, and Senator Rand Paul accepted bitcoin during his 2015 presidential bid.

XRP’s Low Volatility: A Function of Ripple’s Legal Battle With The SEC - Coin Edition


							

The lingering case between the SEC and Ripple is impacting on XRP’s price action.
The SEC is seeking a severe punishment for Ripple, proposing a $2 billion penalty.
XRP community is hopeful for a Ripple victory in the end.




The lingering case between the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and Ripple is impacting XRP’s price action. The embattled altcoin has experienced an extended period of low volatility despite notable developments among other elements of the crypto industry.





XRP’s behavior reflects the keenness with which crypto users observe developments in the SEC vs Ripple case, with an eventual outcome that could determine the altcoin’s long-term trend. For context, the SEC is seeking severe punishment for Ripple, with plans to appeal an initial judgment that partially exonerated the fintech firm from breaking the commission’s rules.









In a March 2024 remedies-related opening brief, the SEC filed that Ripple continued to breach U.S. securities laws after a December 2020 complaint. Following the claim, the commission sought the court to condemn Ripple to a $2 billion penalty and an injunction stopping the firm from selling XRP to institutional investors.



Meanwhile, Ripple responded to the SEC’s filing, claiming not to have breached the laws of the land. Ripple claimed it sold XRP to accredited investors or through ODL contract-based sales. The blockchain firm seeks to convince Judge Torres to rule in its favor to avoid a potential $2 billion penalty and an injunction.



The crypto community appears to be keenly observing how the case will unfold, especially with the SEC’s recent Ethereum ETF approval that surprised many users. A favorable judgment for Ripple could inject an upside momentum for XRP, setting the altcoin up for a significant bull run.



Despite low volatility, XRP has experienced three days of continued upside momentum. The embattled altcoin closed above its opening price for the past three days, reflecting a positive outlook among community members. The embattled altcoin traded for $0.53910 as of the time of writing, following a 0.42% pullback from the previous day’s 1.43% gain, according to data from TradingView.

Will US Crypto Foe Gary Gensler Remain SEC Chair? When is the Change? - Bitcoin Sistemi


Investment bank TD Cowen's research group noted that the latest approval of Ethereum ETFs is an expected development following the approval of Bitcoin ETFs earlier this year.
The approval, which came nearly six months earlier than expected, was seen as inevitable after the SEC approved Ethereum Futures ETFs.


“After the SEC approved crypto futures ETFs, this decision was inevitable,” Jaret Seiberg, a member of TD Cowen's Washington Research Group, said in a note Thursday. He also predicted that the next product could be a “basket of crypto tokens” within a year, possibly consisting of just Bitcoin and Ethereum, but potentially more.

However, the approval does not indicate a change in the SEC's overall attitude towards crypto, according to analysts. Gary Gensler, the agency's crypto-critical president, issued a “highly critical” statement opposing the adoption of crypto legislation that could diminish his agency's power.






Gensler said:

“The crypto industry's track record of failures, scams, and bankruptcies is not because we don't have rules, or because the rules are unclear.
“This is because many investors in the crypto industry do not play by the rules.”

This Week on Crypto Twitter: Six Days That Changed the Industry Forever? - Decrypt

Illustration by Mitchell Preffer for DecryptIt's always difficult to overstate the level of chaos and madness typically present on Crypto Twitter, and within the digital assets industry, on any given day. But it’s equally hard to think of a single week that brought such monumental—and unexpected—plot twists and developments as this one. Things got to a slow start on Monday—until the afternoon brought declarations from Eric Balchunas and James Seyffart, two Bloomberg ETF analysts that have emerged as main characters of the Crypto Twittersphere this year, suddenly announced that they were radically adjusting their previous probabilities that the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) would approve spot Ethereum ETFs by a Thursday deadline.Twitter—and ETH’s price—immediately exploded. For weeks, the prospect of spot ETH ETF approval in May had been written off as fanciful, for multiple reasons. Now, with 72 hours to go before the SEC's May 23 decision cutoff, the game was back on? ETH soared over 20% on the news overnight. Potential ETH ETF issuers kicked from business as usual into overdrive as the industry's prevailing mood accelerated into frantic excitement. In real-time, Twitter users attempted to piece together the narrative. How could this have even happened? Experts pointed to seeds planted last week, when a string of surprising shifts in the political winds may have transformed crypto from divisive, niche wedge issue into a matter of bipartisan consensus.The narrative appeared validated on Thursday, when—right at the buzzer—the SEC quietly approved all pending spot ETH ETF applications. Crypto Twitter exploded in a cacophony of celebration. Industry leaders, including Coinbase’s chief legal officer Paul Grewal, hailed the week’s events as unlike any he’d previously witnessed.As if that wasn’t enough: amidst the entire mind-boggling ETH ETF saga, the U.S. House of Representatives handily passed a bill aimed at creating a crypto regulatory framework, FIT21.The narrative of a historic, overnight realignment of crypto’s long-tenuous relationship with the American government had solidified. Just a week ago, such a state of play would have been dismissed as unthinkable by many.Some cautioned that said narrative might also be too good to be true, however. Certain aspects of FIT21, for example, might be more hostile to crypto than many realize, crypto lawyer Gabriel Shapiro wrote.  As Crypto Twitter was largely jubilant—for good reason—history may just show a battle won in a longer war. “We have to stay vigilant,” Ethereum co-founder and Consensys CEO Joe Lubin told Decrypt. “We can't assume that we’re not going to be attacked again.”Edited by Ryan Ozawa.Daily Debrief NewsletterStart every day with the top news stories right now, plus original features, a podcast, videos and more.

2 Trillion Shiba Inu (SHIB) in Last 24 Hours: Are Whales Coming Back?

Shiba Inu whales are on the verge of waking up as transactional activity on large wallets seems to be surging and reaching almost 2 trillion. However, the lack of momentum in the market suggests that it is too early to celebrate, and those transfers might simply be tied to funds redistribution rather than anything significant for the price.Fresh data has emerged that more transactions are happening within the Shiba Inu network. For the last 24 hours, 147 large transactions have occurred, whose cumulative volume is valued at 1.9 trillion SHIB. The activity bounces off a seven-day low of 82 transactions that took place on May 19, 2024.Analyzing surgeA sudden spike in big transactions could mean numerous things. For one, it's a good probability that large holders in the market are just redistributing their assets. This movement of funds might be related to internal wallet reorganizations, with preparations for future market moves, or simple asset redistribution for liquidity purposes.Source: IntoTheBlockAll of this fueled the volume of transactions, but the general feeling around SHIB remained pretty neutral. Price showed no actual upward motion and was still close to $0.000024. The relative strength index confirmed a lack of buying power as well by staying above the 50-point neutral level.Potential implicationsStill, the fact that actions from such whales are visible gives no clear indicator that the price also necessarily increases. The dynamics of the market suggest that these large moves might actually amount to no new investment but circulating capital from existing holders. In that regard, the small price effect was affected at best, and SHIB remains within a tight horizontal range.This would require sustained buying pressure and overall market optimism for SHIB to really experience a bull run. Indicators are showing signs of a bullish breakout, but not just yet. Investors watch support and resistance zones at $0.000022 and $0.000026, respectively, with a keen interest in the level market movement.

Top Trader Predicts Ethereum Will Massively Outperform Bitcoin, Says One ‘Golden Child’ Memecoin Set To Go Higher - The Daily Hodl


								A widely followed trader says that Ethereum (ETH) is about to vastly outrun Bitcoin (BTC) and is predicting one memecoin will rally hard.
Pseudonymous trader Bluntz tells his 259,000 followers on the social media platform X that he’s got his eye on the two-week chart of the Ethereum versus Bitcoin (ETH/BTC) pair.










The trader says that ETH/BTC is just days away from printing a rare bullish divergence, hinting at an outperformance of Ethereum over Bitcoin. A bullish divergence may indicate reversal areas amid rising momentum even though the price moves down or sideways.
Bluntz targets the 0.1 BTC level ($6,907), which is nearly 95% above current levels of ETH/BTC.
“Only eight days to go until ETH/BTC prints the first two-week bullish divergence since *checks notes*…. never.
0.1 [BTC] is obviously the target but we either undershoot or overshoot the f..k out of that.”
Source: Bluntz/X
Outside of Ethereum, Bluntz is also bullish on the frog-themed memecoin Pepe (PEPE) – which he says is the best-looking major coin of its sector.
He says Pepe will be the “golden child” of memecoins while ETH/BTC bottoms out and regains traction.
“Look like PEPE was the best-looking meme of the majors after all.
With ETH/BTC likely bottomed (in my opinion), I think it will continue to be the golden child meme moving forward and likely goes higher than many are expecting possible but at the end of the day we’re all speculating here.”
Source: Bluntz/X
At time of writing, PEPE is worth $0.000015.

Donald Trump declares support for crypto, insists US must not settle for ‘second place’


    Former President and leading 2024 Republican candidate Donald Trump has voiced his strongest support for cryptocurrency to date. 



Not long after endorsing the cryptocurrency sector as a cornerstone of his presidential bid, Trump reiterated his strong support for digital assets.



In a May 25 post on Truth Social, a social media platform owned by Trump Media and Technology Group (TMTG), he stated:”Our country must be the leader in the field, there is no second place.” 











This pro-crypto stance, shared just before his appearance at the Libertarian National Convention, marks a significant shift in his views as he prepares for the 2024 presidential race.



Cryptocurrency donations and campaign strategy



Trump’s campaign began accepting cryptocurrency donations on May 21 via Coinbase Commerce. 




“I am very positive and open-minded to cryptocurrency companies and all things related to this new and burgeoning industry,” -Trump stated, contrasting his approach with that of President Joe Biden’s administration.




In recent years, Trump expressed skepticism about cryptocurrencies compared to the U.S. dollar and supported stringent regulations on digital currencies. 



However, after a successful venture into Trump-branded NFT trading cards and with crypto policy emerging as a significant campaign issue, Trump now appears poised to position himself as the pro-crypto candidate.



Following Trump’s pro-crypto announcements, sentiment appears to be shifting. The U.S. House of Representatives passed its first comprehensive crypto market structure bill, aiming to regulate the industry broadly. The measure now heads to the Senate. 



Additionally, the S Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) approved key regulatory filings for ether exchange-traded funds (ETFs), marking significant progress toward their availability in the U.S.



Pledge to pardon Ross Ulbricht



In a related development, Trump has pledged to pardon Ross Ulbricht, the founder of the Silk Road darknet market, if re-elected. 



Ulbricht, convicted in 2015, is currently serving two life terms plus forty years without parole. 



“If you vote for me, on day one I will commute the sentence of Ross Ulbricht,” Trump promised at the Libertarian Party’s National Convention, signaling his commitment to the crypto community.



Trump’s evolving stance on cryptocurrency, from accepting donations to advocating for pro-crypto policies, marks a notable shift.



As the 2024 election approaches, his position on crypto could influence regulatory perspectives and voter support, potentially reshaping the landscape of digital asset regulation in the United States.

Ethereum devs set Pectra upgrade for Q1 2025 - Crypto Briefing


            
            
                            
            
                            
            
            Ethereum’s anticipated Pectra upgrade is now scheduled for release by the end of Q1 2025, according to recent updates from Ethereum developers. Pectra is the next major milestone on Ethereum’s development roadmap, following the Dencun upgrade which was successfully deployed in March.The decision comes after Ethereum developers evaluated multiple timeline scenarios. The team has opted against a rushed release before Devcon in November 2024, favoring a more cautious approach that allows for the inclusion of additional, impactful user features.“We are observing that this is also what happened with Cancun, so being realistic, my vote would be to aim to ship Prague in Q1 2025. With today’s scope, delaying Prague seems to have marginal impact on users and allows us to consider expanding the scope to include more impactful features for users,” Ethereum developers noted in a document.Devcon is the largest developer summit in the Asia Pacific region. This year, the event will take place in Bangkok, Thailand, from November 12-15, aiming to bring together developers, technology leaders, and dev-tool companies to learn, discuss, and debate the key opportunities and challenges in the developer ecosystem.Avoiding releasing the Pectra upgrade before/during Devcon will allow the developer team to effectively monitor the execution of Pectra.During the deployment of Dencun on the Goerli testnet in January, Ethereum developers encountered difficulties achieving consensus within the expected timeframe. The issue was then resolved, allowing the Goerli testnet to finally reach consensus.In addition to the upgrade timeline, the focus is on improvements in the consensus layer scope and execution layer scope. Developers aim to integrate PeerDAS into Pectra to enhance Ethereum’s Data Availability capacity ahead of the Osaka upgrade, as noted in the document.Ethereum’s Osaka upgrade is a future hard fork that is expected to include features that were previously considered for the Pectra upgrade but have been postponed. Specifically, the Osaka upgrade is likely to include the implementation of Verkle Tree, a new data structure designed to enhance Ethereum’s scalability and decentralization.Developers also considered the inclusion of EOF to improve smart contract security and developer experience, as well as other enhancements like replacing EIP-3074 with EIP-7702 for better account abstraction compatibility, and patching EIP-2935.“We need to decide on EIP7702 on ACDE, and if so, implement it as a replacement for EIP-3074. We think it makes sense to do so as it’s a more native-AA compatible solution because of the new transaction type vs an opcode,” Ethereum developers wrote.EIP-7702 is a new transaction type proposed by a group of prominent Ethereum developers, including Vitalik Buterin, earlier this month. The proposal is expected to bring similar benefits to EIP-3074 while addressing its potential risks.

Cardano (ADA) Triumphs: 10 Million Tokens Milestone Achieved

The Cardano network has reached a significant milestone, surpassing 10 million native tokens. This achievement underscores Cardano's increasing adoption within the blockchain and cryptocurrency space.Native tokens allow the transacting of multi-assets on Cardano. Cardano uniquely allows users to transact with ADA, as well as an unlimited number of user-defined (custom) tokens natively.Native support has specific advantages for developers: There is no need to create smart contracts to handle custom tokens, for example, which eliminates an additional layer of complexity and the possibility of manual errors because the ledger manages all token-related functionality.According to the most recent IOG weekly report, native tokens have reached 10 million with 120,576 token policies. Currently, network transactions have reached 90.8 million, while Plutus scripts are at 46,698.Looking ahead, the Cardano network is poised for further growth and expansion. The continued development of its smart contract capabilities and the upcoming upgrades such as the Chang network upgrade are expected to attract even more users to the platform.ADA price actionCardano's ADA recent price rise appears to have stalled under the pressure of its daily moving averages.ADA began to rise gradually and reached highs of $0.51 on May 21 before running into resistance. After that, ADA decreased for four days in a row before rising again. Selling has continued, with ADA down 0.33% to $0.4611 at the time of writing, during the last 24 hours.The 50-day and 200-day simple moving averages (SMA) have posed significant barriers to the rising trend of ADA since the beginning of April. Further conjecture over the short-term price trajectory of ADA is raised by a recent crossing that showed a death cross. The 50-day EMA serves as an immediate resistance level for ADA in the short term, which it must surpass to indicate a possible rally.Following the approval of Ethereum ETFs, traders, and analysts will continue to watch the indicators and market signals closely, ready to adjust their strategies in response to ADA's next significant move. The coming days and weeks will be crucial in determining the direction of ADA's price.

Buterin Sucks (BUTSUCKS) to Explode 14,000% Ahead of KuCoin Listing, as Shiba Inu, Bonk and Dogecoin Lag



                    

Early investors in memecoins like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Bonk (BONK) and Dogecoin (DOGE) made astronomical returns, and Buterin Sucks (BUTSUCKS) presents a similar opportunity for a limited time.



Buterin Sucks (BUTSUCKS), a newly launched Solana memecoin, is poised to explode over 14,000% in a matter of days, as former Shiba Inu (SHIB), Bonk (BONK) and Dogecoin (DOGE) investors pour funds into this new token.




BUTSUCKS will be listed on KuCoin, one of the largest centralized exchanges in the world, within a few days – and this is a massively bullish development for the token, as millions of new investors will easily be able to buy Buterin Sucks.



Currently, Buterin Sucks can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jupiter and Raydium, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days.

BUTSUCKS currently has a market cap of just under $12,000, with over $4,000 in locked liquidity, meaning it has huge upside potential.



Early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and Bonk (BONK) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price.

Donald Trump Promises Big Changes for Crypto Industry


Former US President Donald Trump has reaffirmed his support for the cryptocurrency industry, expressing a strong commitment to its growth.
On May 25, the former president made several pro-crypto statements before the November election.
Donald Trump’s Latest Pledges to the Crypto Industry

Donald Trump strongly supported the cryptocurrency industry, emphasizing that the United States must strive to be a global leader in this growing sector.

“I am very positive and open minded to cryptocurrency companies, and all things related to this new and burgeoning industry. Our country must be the leader in the field. There is no second place,” Trump stated.

He further contrasted his stance with that of President Joe Biden, whom he accused of wanting to stifle the crypto industry. “That will never happen with me,” Trump asserted. Later, at the Libertarian Party’s National Convention in Washington, Trump told attendees that he would protect their right to self-custody crypto assets and prevent the creation of a central bank digital currency (CBDC). 

“I will support the right to self-custody. To the nation’s fifty million crypto holders, I say this: I will keep Elizabeth Warren and her goons away from your bitcoin, and I will never allow the creation of a central bank digital currency,” Trump addded.

Remarkably, the former President also pledged to pardon Ross Ulbricht if re-elected. In 2015, a court sentenced Ulbricht to two consecutive life terms plus 40 years for creating and operating Silk Road, a darknet marketplace primarily used for drug transactions. However, many in the crypto community argue that Ulbricht’s sentence represents a governmental overreach. 

 “If you vote for me, on Day one, I will commute Ross Ulbricht’s sentence to time served. He’s already served 11 years, and we’re going to get him home,” Trump promised.


Meanwhile, Trump’s pro-crypto stance appears to be enhancing his election prospects. According to Polymarket, a popular crypto-based prediction platform, Donald Trump has a 56% chance of winning the election, compared to Biden’s 38%.

Trump’s chances increased substantially over the past months following a series of pro-crypto actions and statements. Notably, his campaign has begun accepting crypto donations in various digital assets, including Bitcoin, making him the first major candidate to do so.

In response, the Biden administration has noticeably shifted its approach to crypto. The White House has expressed interest in working with Congress on effective crypto regulations. Additionally, the crypto-skeptic Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) approved an Ethereum ETF, marking a significant policy shift.

ETF Approval Changes Everything, Says Ethereum Co-Founder Joe Lubin - Decrypt

We do the research, you get the alpha!Get exclusive reports and access to key insights on airdrops, NFTs, and more! Subscribe now to Alpha Reports and up your game!Go to Alpha ReportsFew weeks in crypto’s short history have seen as much progress as this one. In Washington, D.C., a sudden confluence of bipartisan support coalescing behind a crypto regulation bill on Wednesday, followed the next day by the stunning eleventh-hour approval of spot Ethereum ETFs by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).   To Ethereum co-founder and Consensys CEO Joe Lubin, both events—particularly the SEC’s about-face on Ethereum—represent a seismic shift in how crypto is treated in America, and will be moving forward.“I think this is a game changer,” the entrepreneur told Decrypt in an exclusive interview.Consensys, the $7 billion Ethereum software company founded by Lubin, is currently ensnared in multiple legal battles with the SEC over crypto’s legal status. (Disclosure: Consensys is one of 22 investors in Decrypt.) But Lubin believes this week’s events may have proved that crypto has graduated to a higher status within the American power apparatus—upending the calculus for such battles. “My guess is that this is now an extremely important political issue,” he said. “And that overrides.”“If you want to get elected, you’re probably going to either need to have the blockchain decentralized protocol ecosystem on your side,” Lubin continued. “Or at least you don’t want them to hate you.”As Lubin sees it, the SEC’s decision to approve spot ETH ETFs was undeniably a last-minute political decision, potentially put in motion by a request—or demand—from the White House itself.That political pressure, multiple crypto lobbyists in Washington previously told Decrypt, likely stemmed from a series of election-related developments last week.SEC leadership likely feels no different about crypto than it did a week ago—the silence from the agency has been deafening—but political pressures may have now thrown a wrench in its aggressive, ongoing legal crusade against top American crypto firms like Consensys. Lubin isn’t letting down his guard just yet, however. “We have to stay vigilant,” he said. “We can't assume that we’re not going to be attacked again.”Edited by Ryan Ozawa.Daily Debrief NewsletterStart every day with the top news stories right now, plus original features, a podcast, videos and more.

FTX Estate Sells Remaining Discounted Solana Tokens in Bid to Repay Creditors

                        The FTX estate, responsible for managing the defunct exchange’s bankruptcy, has auctioned off the last of its heavily discounted Solana (SOL) tokens.The tokens were sold to Pantera Capital and Figure Markets at a significantly reduced price as part of efforts to reimburse creditors and former clients.FTX Sold $2.6 Billion Worth Of Solana Token (SOL)In a bid to compensate creditors and former clients, the FTX estate sold the last of its Solana tokens, valued at $2.6 billion, to Pantera Capital and Figure Markets. The tokens were sold at $102 per token, well below the current market price of $168. Figure Markets acquired 800,000 SOL tokens, while Pantera Capital obtained the remaining lot.A four-year vesting schedule for the tokens will be implemented as part of the agreement with the purchasers. This structured release aims to mitigate potential market impacts from the large transaction.The FTX bankruptcy estate has recovered $7.3 billion in assets so far. However, the recovery efforts have not been without controversy.Sunil Kavuri, a creditor leading the FTX creditor community, criticized the estate’s decision to sell assets at such deep discounts. He argued that the digital assets should have been returned to the creditors and clients directly rather than sold cheaply.Kavuri stated, “Sullivan & Cromwell has trampled over our property rights. They have liquidated billions of dollars of crypto assets. There’s a token S&C sold at 11 cents; it’s now trading at two dollars. FTX had $10 billion in Solana tokens — they sold it at a 70% discount.”His sentiments reflect broader frustrations among those affected by the FTX collapse, who have long been critical of the actions taken by the estate’s bankruptcy lawyers, Sullivan & Cromwell. The court ordered an independent investigation into Sullivan & Cromwell’s role in the bankruptcy proceedings, ultimately clearing them of collusion with FTX. Despite this, criticisms persist regarding the handling of asset sales.Following the announcement of the bankruptcy auctions, SOL’s price dropped by 4%, but the alternative layer-1 network continues to show strong price performance. SOL is currently on an uptrend that began in November 2023, reaching a high of $210.Uncovering More Corruption Surrounding FTX
According to an independent examiner’s report by Robert Cleary, FTX Group allegedly paid over $25 million in hush money to seven whistleblowers before the crypto exchange’s collapse in November 2022.The report revealed that FTX settled claims with whistleblowers who raised concerns about various improprieties, including systemic issues and misleading regulators. These settlements, handled primarily by attorney Daniel Friedberg, ranged from $1.8 million to $16 million.For instance, one whistleblower received $16 million after alleging the exchange misled regulators and lacked proper corporate structure, while another, who worked at Alameda Research for less than three months, received $2 million for raising concerns about regulatory and governance issues.Notably, US prosecutors are seeking a 5—to 7-year sentence for former FTX executive Ryan Salame, who pleaded guilty to campaign finance violations and operating an illegal money-transmitting business during his tenure as CEO of FTX’s Bahamian subsidiary. Salame’s charges include orchestrating a scheme allowing customers to use U.S.-based bank accounts without federal compliance and participating in illegal political donations amounting to over $100 million. Prosecutors argue that his offenses are significant, involving more than $1 billion in unlicensed transactions, and call for a substantial sentence to ensure appropriate punishment and deter future offenses.The UK government’s Charity Commission investigation also recently found that Effective Ventures Foundation, an FTX-funded charity, acted diligently and quickly to protect its funds after FTX’s collapse. Following FTX’s collapse, Effective Ventures disclosed its connections to the exchange, prompting a regulatory probe. The charity repaid $4.3 million to the FTX estate, matching the total amount it received from FTX and its foundation in 2022. Effective Ventures’ interim CEO, Zachary Robinson, stated that EV UK and EV US collectively repaid $26.8 million to the FTX estate, covering all funds received.

Will US Crypto Foe Gary Gensler Remain SEC Chair? When is the Change? - Bitcoin Sistemi


Investment bank TD Cowen's research group noted that the latest approval of Ethereum ETFs is an expected development following the approval of Bitcoin ETFs earlier this year.
The approval, which came nearly six months earlier than expected, was seen as inevitable after the SEC approved Ethereum Futures ETFs.



However, the approval does not indicate a change in the SEC's overall attitude towards crypto, according to analysts. Gary Gensler, the agency's crypto-critical president, issued a “highly critical” statement opposing the adoption of crypto legislation that could diminish his agency's power.






Gensler said:

“The crypto industry's track record of failures, scams, and bankruptcies is not because we don't have rules, or because the rules are unclear.
“This is because many investors in the crypto industry do not play by the rules.”

Despite potential setbacks for Gensler's agency, TD Cowen predicts the SEC will maintain its Democratic majority through 2026. The research group expects the agency to continue taking action against crypto trading platforms that trade tokens believed to be unregistered securities.

RIP DOGEY (RIPDOGEY) to Skyrocket 18,000% as KuCoin Listing Announced, While Shiba Inu and Dogecoin Struggle



                    

RIP DOGEY (RIPDOGEY) could turn early investors into multi-millionaires if it becomes a mainstream coin, like Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE).



RIP DOGEY (RIPDOGEY), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is poised to explode over 18,000% in price in the coming days.




This is because RIPDOGEY has announced its first centralized exchange listing, which will be on KuCoin.



This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up.



Currently, RIP DOGEY can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jupiter and Raydium, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days.



Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and RIP DOGEY could become the next viral memecoin.



RIP DOGEY launched with over $6,000 of locked liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains.



To buy RIP DOGEY on Raydium or Jupiter ahead of the KuCoin listing, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for RIP DOGEY by entering its contract address – GVZoEtPFj1fMuW2zA4Zww27Mcx1yJSobrW3hzp5hfqCe – in the receiving field.



In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price.




If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner.



The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum.




This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like RIPDOGEY.

Shiba Inu's Shibarium Skyrockets 60% in Key On-Chain Metric in 24 Hours


The Shiba Inu ecosystem has witnessed a notable rise in activity on its Shibarium network, marked by an increase in a key blockchain metric over the last 24 hours. Shibariumscan reports that transaction volume jumped from 5,150 to 7,930, reflecting a notable 60% growth.This spike in transaction volume has concurrently led to a sharp increase in network fees. The amount of BONE tokens used to pay these fees climbed from 16.68 BONE to 32 BONE during the same period.As per Shibarium's transaction model, BONE are used for transaction fees, and a portion of these tokens is converted into SHIB, which are then burned. This burning process decreases the circulating supply of Shiba Inu tokens, potentially boosting their price over time.Source: ShibariumscanSeveral elements are driving this surge in network activity. Recent market volatility has heightened investor interest in Shiba Inu tokens, leading to an increase in transaction demand on Shibarium.Source: ShibariumscanThis heightened activity is evidenced by a 13.7% increase in active accounts on the network, rising from 687 to 781. Notably, while active user numbers grew, new account creation slightly declined, suggesting that the existing user base is fueling this surge in activity.It seems that the dual advantages of rising transaction volumes and the systematic reduction of SHIB tokens through burning are driving the network's growth and potential for future value appreciation. This dynamic is likely encouraging SHIB enthusiasts to remain engaged and continue investing in the Shiba Inu network.

Retail traders dominate the action on Ethereum as the ETF narrative takes over


    The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) approved, on May 23, securities exchanges’ listing of Ethereum (ETH) spot exchange-traded funds (ETFs). ETH’s price surged following the news as related keywords started dominating the cryptocurrency space.



However, Vini Barbosa spotted divergent data on Santiment’s Sanbase Pro charts, suggesting retail traders currently dominate the Ethereum market.



In particular, Ethereum’s social dominance reached year-over-year highs at 14.21%, strongly dominating other cryptocurrencies in social indicators. This index alone usually suggests retail traders are the protagonists in the current action, and whales have previously opened positions.







Additionally, a key on-chain metric of network activity made one-year lows, showing divergence with the price and social indicators. Ethereum registered a weekly $7.63 million in on-chain transaction volume, which validates retail traders’ protagonism with lower relative volume.

Retail traders navigate Ethereum ETF news



From another perspective, Finbold also gathered data from Santiment that reveals the keywords “Ethereum,” or “ETH” dominated social context together with “ETF” on May 23 with 563 mentions on social platforms and a 4.05% dominance over other trending keywords.

Interestingly, most media outlets and influencers covered the SEC’s first-step approval of Ethereum ETFs, which the crowd replicated in groups. This could have fueled retail’s ‘fear of missing out’ (FOMO), driving ETH price upwards on crypto exchanges.



Yet, it is important to understand that the ETFs still need further approvals from the regulatory agency to start trading. The SEC currently only approved NASDAQ, CBOE, and NYSE to list the assets, but not the assets’ issuers themselves.



ETH price analysis



As of this writing, Ethereum was trading at $3,811, up 1% over its price on May 23. Moreover, ETH has nearly 22% accumulated gains month-over-month, suggesting institutional traders were already previously pricing the ETF news.



ETH/USD monthly chart. Source: Finbold



Now, ETH must be able to keep its momentum despite the drop in related social indicators and network activity. This will be challenging, and a weaker momentum with retail traders’ dominance could foreshadow a price correction before further surges.



Investors must remain cautious and avoid opening positions under FOMO, making rational and thoughtful decisions moving forward.

Buterin Sucks (BUTSUCKS) Will Explode 14,000% Ahead of KuCoin Listing, as Shiba Inu, Bonk and Dogecoin Lag



                    

Early investors in memecoins like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Bonk (BONK) and Dogecoin (DOGE) made astronomical returns, and Buterin Sucks (BUTSUCKS) presents a similar opportunity for a limited time.



Buterin Sucks (BUTSUCKS), a newly launched Solana memecoin, is poised to explode over 14,000% in a matter of days, as former Shiba Inu (SHIB), Bonk (BONK) and Dogecoin (DOGE) investors pour funds into this new token.




BUTSUCKS will be listed on KuCoin, one of the largest centralized exchanges in the world, within a few days – and this is a massively bullish development for the token, as millions of new investors will easily be able to buy Buterin Sucks.

PEPE: 100% Gains In 30 Days, But Can It Keep Its Composure?


																The cryptocurrency world is witnessing a familiar sight: a meme coin on fire. PEPE, a token emblazoned with the internet’s favorite frog, has skyrocketed in recent weeks, leaving investors wondering if this is the dawn of a new era or a fleeting fad.

	Related Reading


PEPE On A Tear: New Highs And Whale Activity
Over the past month, PEPE has been on a tear, exceeding expectations and leaving a trail of green for investors. The price triumphantly reached a new all-time high, surging over 100% in just 30 days. This astronomical rise translated to happy hodlers, with IntoTheBlock data revealing that a whopping 97% were sitting pretty in profit.
CoinGecko data show that Pepe has risen 56% in the previous week and 99% in the last month, recovering its position as the third-largest meme coin by market capitalization from Dogwifhat (WIF).
The bullish momentum hasn’t shown any signs of slowing down. The past 24 hours saw another surge of 3.7%, further propelling PEPE to its current peak. This impressive performance has garnered significant attention, not just financially, but also on social media. The coin’s social volume has spiked, indicating a surge in interest and online chatter.
Total crypto market cap close to $2.5 trillion. Chart: TradingView
Adding fuel to the fire, a whale, a term used for large investors with significant buying power, has been making waves. Lookonchain, a blockchain analytics platform, recently reported a whale withdrawing a staggering 500 billion PEPE from Binance, a major cryptocurrency exchange. This mass accumulation suggests a whale-sized vote of confidence in PEPE’s future.
Buying Frenzy Or Overheated Engine?
While the recent price increase and social media buzz are undoubtedly positive signs, some analysts are urging caution. A closer look at technical indicators reveals potential signs of an overheated market. The Chaikin Money Flow (CMF), which measures buying and selling pressure, has registered a decline.

Similarly, the Money Flow Index (MFI) and Relative Strength Index (RSI) are both hovering in the overbought zone, suggesting PEPE’s price might be due for a correction.
Further complicating the picture is the presence of selling pressure. While some investors are piling in, others might be cashing out on their profits. Santiment, a crypto analytics platform, observed a rise in PEPE’s exchange outflow last week, indicating buying pressure. However, they also noted an increase in supply on exchanges, suggesting some investors might be taking advantage of the high price to sell.

Potential Price Correction
NewsBTC analyzed PEPE’s daily chart to gauge the impact of this potential selling pressure. Their analysis suggests that the price might first fall to $0.0000122 before potentially finding support and initiating another bull run. However, a deeper correction could see PEPE plummet to $0.000010 or even lower.

The Most Traded Memecoin
Meanhwhile, Pepe was still among the most traded cryptocurrency assets over the previous day, according to data from Binance, with only BNB Coin (BNB), Bitcoin (BTC), and Ethereum (ETH) surpassing it.
Pepe continues to be the most traded meme coin, surpassing popular coins such as Dogecoin (DOGE), Floki (FLOKI), and Shiba Inu (SHIB).

Political support is bad for Bitcoin in the long run: Samson Mow - Crypto Briefing


            
            
                            
            
                            
            
            Former Blockstream Chief Strategy Officer Samson Mow believes that the newfound political support for Bitcoin could weaken its core principles and increase the risk of future failures that could harm users.“I’m not bullish on politicians becoming pro “crypto.” It may feel nice given the prior hostile anti-crypto stances, but long term it’s bad for Bitcoin,” Mow stated in a recent post on X.According to Mow, political involvement potentially compromises Bitcoin’s strength. He pointed out that the shift in stance could lead to similar collapses like FTX or Luna and ultimately harm the entire ecosystem.“Without a strong Bitcoin ethos, this shift only paves the way for the next FTX/Luna/Genesis, & once again, we will pay for it,” he added.Mow’s comments follow a post by Senator Cynthia Lummis, a known advocate for crypto’s future in the US.Mow didn’t oppose the fact that Lummis is one of the most genuine pro-Bitcoin politicians. However, he disagreed with Lummis grouping Bitcoin with other crypto assets. He said that many people, including politicians who are becoming pro-Bitcoin, might not understand the difference between Bitcoin and other crypto assets.Crypto has become an increasingly influential factor in US politics in recent years, with industry entities investing heavily in lobbying and campaign contributions to shape regulations and elect sympathetic representatives.Over the past two weeks, US lawmakers have voted on three crypto-related bills, including H.J.Res. 109, a bill seeking to overturn SEC’s crypto rule SAB 121, FIT21, a bill created to establish a regime to regulate US crypto markets, and the CBDC Anti-Surveillance State Act, a legislation aiming to prevent the Federal Reserve from issuing a central bank digital currency (CBDC).The most remarkable development is that the Biden administration has softened its stance toward crypto. Instead of threatening a veto of FIT21, which the White House did with H.J.Res. 109, it only voiced concerns about the lack of investor protection.Some experts and industry figures suggest that the recent listing approval of spot Ethereum exchange-traded funds (ETFs) in the US may be partly influenced by political considerations.They speculate that the US Securities and Exchange Commission’s (SEC) decision might have been impacted by potential pressure from the Biden administration, which has long faced criticism for its stance on crypto regulation.Observers believe these moves are part of a strategy to win votes in the upcoming presidential election, especially since Donald Trump, Biden’s biggest competitor, has publicly advocated making the US a crypto leader. Trump also aims to end hostility toward the industry.

Legendary trader foresees major crypto disaster ahead


    The recent approval of Ethereum (ETH) exchange-traded funds (ETFs) by regulatory bodies marks a significant milestone in cryptocurrency history. 



Amidst this development, veteran trader Peter Brandt has raised alarms, warning of potential disasters in the crypto staking sector following the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) green light for spot Ethereum ETFs.



Peter Brandt, a well-known figure in the trading community, took to social media platform X (formerly Twitter) on May 24 to express his grim outlook. 







“The biggest disasters yet to come in crypto will be related to staking,” Brandt predicted, emphasizing the potential for significant financial losses and bankruptcies.







Potential regulatory impact



Brandt’s recent warnings are part of a broader critique he has been voicing. Earlier this month, he predicted a full-scale SEC assault on crypto staking, describing it as a “bloodbath” and deeming the practice “illegal as hell.”



Brandt’s comments came in the wake of the SEC’s unexpected approval of eight spot Ethereum ETFs, a decision that caught many in the crypto industry off guard. 



Previously, the SEC had not engaged with issuers, but it suddenly began interacting with them and requested resubmissions of filings on an accelerated basis. 



Despite the approval of spot Ethereum ETFs, the SEC has not clarified whether Ethereum is classified as a security or a commodity. Notably, all issuers of these ETFs did not include staking in their applications, which highlights a critical distinction.



Concerns and reactions from the crypto community



Brandt elaborated on his concerns in follow-up posts, outlining the potential negative impacts of staking on the market.



He pointed out that crypto staking involves owning, borrowing, or leveraging assets such as Solana (SOL) and Ethereum. These assets are typically lent out to earn revenue, often in the form of interest. 



Brandt cautioned that as staking becomes more widespread and accepted, it could attract increased scrutiny and regulation from central banks, government treasuries, and other authorities.



He was skeptical of the profitability of staking, comparing it to collapsed scams like Ponzi schemes, where high returns were often fraudulent. He warned that the introduction of new regulations could fundamentally change the crypto space or even lead to the end of staking.







Brandt’s predictions have sparked significant debate within the crypto community. Before issuing his controversial statements, Brandt acknowledged that his opinions might not be well received by supporters of popular digital assets such as Ethereum and Solana.



True to his prediction, many community members dismissed his warnings. Critics argued that Brandt was uninformed about the staking process and overstating its risks. 



One community member criticized Brandt for his statement, asserting that he was exaggerating the impacts of staking by claiming it would result in a “disaster.” 



Another member clarified that staking involves using coins or tokens to verify and secure the consensus mechanism of a blockchain rather than simply lending assets for interest.



The future of crypto staking remains uncertain, with Brandt’s warnings highlighting potential risks from increased regulatory scrutiny and government intervention. 



As the crypto industry continues to evolve, stakeholders must navigate these challenges carefully to avoid potential financial disasters. 



The recent approval of Ethereum ETFs by the SEC marks a turning point, but it also brings to light the complexities and uncertainties that lie ahead for the crypto staking sector.

Dogecoin Whales Disappear After DOGE Meme Dog Kabosu's Passing


Dogecoin (DOGE) has seen a noticeable decline in the activity of major players, or "whales," coinciding with the recent passing of Kabosu, the dog immortalized in the iconic Doge meme. Analysis of key metrics shows a significant decline in whale activity.Thus, according to IntoTheBlock, large transactions involving DOGE have dropped significantly over the past 24 hours, down 29.69% to 6.63 billion DOGE. Of particular note is the drop in transactions exceeding $100,000, from $1.56 billion to $1.12 billion, with 1,300 such transactions recorded during the period.The decline in whale activity is also evidenced by a marked reduction in the inflow and outflow of funds to wallets containing at least 0.1% of DOGE's circulating supply. Inflows into these wallets fell 87.52% to a modest 59.86 million coins, while outflows fell to 103.87 million coins, down 29.59% from the previous day.Source: IntoTheBlockThis decline coincided with the announcement of the death of dog Kabosu by its owner on social media. Kabosu's image became synonymous with the Doge meme, which later inspired the creation of Dogecoin in 2013. With a current market capitalization of $24.43 billion and daily trading volume approaching $2 billion, Dogecoin has a major place in the cryptocurrency market.While a direct link between Kabosu's death and the decline in whale activity remains speculative, it is possible that the emotional resonance associated with the beloved dog may have influenced investor sentiment.

Analytics Company Santiment Shares the Most Trending Altcoin Right Now and Why - Bitcoin Sistemi


Cryptocurrency analysis company Santiment shared the token that it thinks is the most trending altcoin of the recent period in its statement.
According to analysts, Ondo (ONDO) is the most trending altcoin in the cryptocurrency world with its 75% rise in the last 11 days. Analysts say ONDO's performance is hard to miss.


Santiment attributes the reason for this price increase and high trend to the increase in the number of ONDO wallets containing assets, which was 5,110 on February 26, to 33,225 wallets today. This means that the number of wallets has increased by 550%. During the same time period, the price of the altcoin increased by approximately 200%.

ONDO, a real-world assets (RWA) themed altcoin, claims to be bringing US bonds to the cryptocurrency world.





However, the altcoin is not listed on Binance at the time of writing this article. However, interestingly, this time Coinbase acted earlier than Binance and listed ONDO. Bybit, Kraken and Kucoin, other major cryptocurrency exchanges, are also among the exchanges currently listing ONDO.

Turkey Will Discuss Cryptocurrency Regulation in Parliament This Week: Here's What to Expect - Bitcoin Sistemi


A regulation determining the legal framework of cryptocurrencies is coming to the agenda of the Parliamentary Planning and Budget Commission this week. With the changes to be made in the Capital Markets Law, the legal definition of crypto assets will be made.
With this regulation, the establishment and activities of crypto asset service providers will need to obtain permission from the Capital Markets Board. Authority for the issuance, sale and distribution of crypto assets will be given to the Capital Markets Board.


Making a statement last week, AK Party Group Chairman Abdullah Güler shared the details of the bill. According to Güler, the bill contains 19 articles.

Cryptocurrency exchanges will start providing services by obtaining a license from the CMB. This aims to ensure that investors can trade safely under the supervision of the CMB.
Crypto asset service providers will be obliged to ensure the security of their information systems. In this context, the criteria to be determined by TÜBİTAK regarding technological infrastructure will be specified in the law.
The sale and distribution of crypto assets will be determined by the CMB. For crypto asset issuance, a preliminary report will be received from TÜBİTAK.
Contractual provisions that limit or eliminate the liability of crypto asset service providers to their customers will be deemed invalid. Control mechanisms will be established to examine investors' complaints and objections. Measures will be taken against market-distorting transactions.
Procedures and principles regarding crypto investment consultancy will be regulated by the CMB.
Customer assets cannot be seized due to the debts of cryptocurrency exchanges.
CMB will monitor exchanges that operate without permission.
Providing crypto asset services without permission will be considered a crime under the Turkish Penal Code and the penalty will be imprisonment from 3 to 5 years.
There will be a transition period for organizations currently operating. Those operating will apply to the board within 1 month or take a decision on liquidation within 3 months.
The activities of crypto asset providers operating abroad will also end with the transition period.


The following was said about the taxation of cryptocurrencies:






“The statement in the proposal, 'Each year, one percent of all revenues of the platforms, excluding the interest income of the previous year, will be paid to the Board and one percent will be recorded as income by paying to the TUBITAK budget by the end of May of the relevant year', relates to the payments to be made by the platforms. “In the proposed law, there is no tax regulation for end users who buy and sell through the platforms.”

Dogwifhat smashes past $3: Will WIF reach $5 soon? - AMBCrypto



Buying pressure on WIF increased over the last few days. 
WIF must go above $3.30 in order to sustain its bull rally.

Dogwifhat [WIF] bulls have stepped up their game over the last few days, as the meme coin registered a double-digit growth. 
As a result, WIF broke above a bullish pattern, which has the potential to cause further growth in the coming days. 
WIF bulls are winning
According to CoinMarketCap, WIF investors were having a great week as the meme coin’s price increased by a healthy 20% in the last seven days. 
The bulls pushed even harder in the last 24 hours as WIF’s value surged by 8%.
 At the time of writing, Dogwifhat was trading at $3.11 with a market capitalization of over $43.1 billion, making it the 38th largest crypto. 
The recent price uptick also allowed the meme coin to break above a symmetrical triangle pattern. Captain Faibik, a popular crypto analyst, recently posted a tweet highlighting this development. 
The tweet mentioned that WIF consolidated inside the pattern for the last 80 days before finally breaking out, which could result in an 80%–90% bull rally soon. 
Apart from this, Lookonchain recently posted a tweet that pointed out that buying pressure on the meme coin was high. 
According to the tweet, a whale spent 17,966 SOL, worth $2.98 million, to buy 953,177 WIF at $3.13. This whale previously spent 1 million USDC to buy 355,417 WIF at $2.81 on the 21st of May. 
However, it was surprising to note that despite the hike in price and buying pressure, sentiment around the meme coin remained bearish as its Weighted Sentiment went into the negative zone. 
Its Social Volume also remained low, reflecting a decline in WIF’s popularity. 
Source: Santiment
WIF’s possible next targets
The good news was that while the meme coin’s price increased, its Open Interest followed a similar path. For starters, the metric represents the total number of active positions in a specific asset.
 A rise in the metric usually hints that the ongoing price trend will continue further. 
However, the metric registered a slight decline in the last few hours.

The Chaikin Money Flow (CMF) looked bearish as it was resting under its neutral mark. Also, the Money Flow Index (MFI) continued to support the buyers as it went northward.

Read dogwifhat’s [WIF] Price Prediction 2024-25

AMBCrypto then analyzed Hyblock Capital’s data to find WIF’s possible targets if its bull rally continues. 
We found that it would be crucial for WIF to go above $3.30 first, as it has twice failed to do that in the recent past. A successful breakout above that level would open the door for WIF to touch $4.

Costco and Salesforce earnings, inflation, crypto: The markets this week

After a week in which the Nasdaq reached a new all-time high and Ether ETFs received SEC approval, standouts in the upcoming week include several earnings reports, new economic data — and potentially some more action in the crypto market.Nvidia earnings stun the street and the stock is soaringOh, and most important, U.S. markets will be closed Monday for the Memorial Day holiday. Check out the best Memorial Day weekend deals here.Macroeconomic data due this weekConsumer sentiment has declined as inflation concerns persist. According to a Friday release from the University of Michigan, the consumer sentiment index for May dropped to 69.1 from 77.2 in April. On Tuesday, the university will publish the results of its consumer confidence survey for May.The Commerce Department will release its GDP report on Thursday. Last month, the growth was much weaker than expected. Moreover, on Friday, the investor will watch the personal consumption expenditures price index, which measures the prices that U.S. residents pay for goods and services. Last month, the key inflation measure increased more than expected. In March, the core personal consumption expenditures price index, excluding food and energy, increased 2.8% from a year ago, an increase similar to February but higher than expected.Analysts are confident about Costco’s report Wholesale giant Costco will release its quarterly report on Thursday. Analysts expect earnings per share of $3.71 on average, up from the initial projection of $3.61 for the third quarter of 2024. Its competitiveness with e-commerce giant Amazon will also draw attention. In the latest quarter, Costco’s e-commerce sales grew by 18.4% compared to the previous year. Costco’s membership base will also be an important factor in determining the growth of the company.Salesforce’s earnings report is dueOn Wednesday, Salesforce, a cloud-based software company, will release its quarterly report. The company made headlines when it initially announced plans to acquire data-management software maker Informatica but later decided against it. The acquisition of Informatica, which would have been Salesforce’s largest acquisition since it bought Slack in 2021, could have been valued at around $10 billion.On average, analysts estimate the quarter’s earnings per share to be $1.82, compared to the reported EPS of $1.15 for the same quarter last year. Furthermore, investors would like to know how the software company is incorporating AI—which is in demand these days—and how this is going to generate revenue.Other earnings to watchIn addition to these, IT company HP will release its quarterly report on Wednesday, while BestBuy and Dollar General will release theirs on Thursday.There may be some action on the crypto marketWith Ether ETFs approved by the Securities and Exchange Commission, the crypto market may see some action soon. It is ironic that the market became volatile before the landmark decision but did not respond afterward. In the last week, Bitcoin reached over $70,000, and Ether went up over 20% in a day before slowing down. Still, there is hope that the crypto market will rise, with some expecting Ether to surge around $6,000 with a 60% increase in its price.

Bitcoin Envisioned to Reach $80,000 by End of May and $95,000 in June ⋆ ZyCrypto

&nbsp
Bitcoin is struggling to restart its long-term bull market, but one analyst believes we are only days away before another all-time high of $80k is achieved. BitQuant, the technical influencer in question, doesn’t stop at that and believes that there is a good chance the crypto asset will reach as high as $95k in a month.







Upon closer scrutiny of the tweet, the analyst admits that the cryptocurrency may record a price correction after going close to the coveted $100k figure in June. At the end of the tweet, he conveniently states that he doesn’t trade local tops, so he won’t be selling his Bitcoin next month even if he records this considerable price gain.



What do Other Analysts Say?



BitQuant is part of a group of Bitcoin proponents on X who believe a healthy price rally is imminent in the coming weeks. However, not all analysts share this rosy picture; some even call for BTC to struggle for a short while before resuming the long-term bull market. Michael Von de Poppe, a more popular crypto trader, believes BTC may remain within $67.5k-$68k. He even called on the market to register short-term price corrections followed by rebounds in the near future. 



Others, including Willy Woo, are less clear about their predictions for June. However, Woo tweeted that it was “only a matter of time before BTC recorded a new All-Time High above $73k.







So, a move at least to $80k is not being ruled out by any crypto analyst right now, but BitQuant’s prediction of $95k within weeks is on the overly optimistic spectrum.

The popular cryptocurrency XRP, which rose 7% in May, could face potential turbulence in June. Last month, XRP ascended above the important psychological mark of $0.5 and maintained stability, much to the annoyance of investors expecting more significant price changes.Despite the performance in May, which is in line with the token's historical average gain of 27.7%, June may not bring the same positive returns.Historically, the first month of summer has not been favorable for XRP. Over more than a decade of history, the average return for June is -5.59% and the median return is -8.92%. This suggests a likely downturn for XRP in the coming month. According to CryptoRank, the last profitable June for XRP was in 2017, and all subsequent Junes have ended with losses of at least 8.15%.XRP to USD by CoinMarketCapWhile the crypto market is known for its unpredictability, the historical data for XRP represents a significant sample given its status as one of the oldest tokens on the market. Investors should be cautious as patterns over the years indicate a high probability of negative returns in June.XRP Monthly Returns by CryptoRankThe stability that XRP showed in May, despite the lack of strong swings, is now in stark contrast to the less optimistic outlook for June. If historical trends continue, XRP bulls may find themselves disappointed as the token could face a decline.While the market awaits the results, the reliability of the XRP price history remains in question. Whether historical patterns will continue in June remains to be seen, but the data suggests that investors hoping for growth in the first month of summer should be cautious.

Biggest Video Games Releasing in June 2024 - Decrypt

June is a quiet month for games. For nearly a quarter century, game journalists would trek out to Los Angeles for the Electronic Entertainment Expo and split time between crawling the busy, loud, show floor and diving into often much-too-cold meeting rooms for a half-height bottle of water and a meeting with developers.But with the departed E3 now in the rearview mirror, Summer Games Fest has taken its place as a less formal, less centralized, and more optional version of that previous event. Because these events pack the month so full of game news, it's often been a slow time for actual game releases.This month, though, there's one huge release you can't ignore in the form of Elden Ring's long-awaited expansion, along with some worthy smaller games to check out. Here’s what we’re looking forward to playing in June.Note: All of the games listed below are traditional or "Web2" video games. None have crypto or blockchain elements, as far as we know.Destiny 2: The Final ShapeRelease Date: June 4Platforms: PC, PlayStation 4/5, Xbox One, Xbox Series X|SDestiny 2's ongoing story has been working up to this moment for years. The Final Shape brings the ongoing Destiny storyline to an end, opening Bungie's slate up to begin a new storyline or even announce Destiny 3. (Don't worry, we don't know anything you don't).Along with bringing the current storyline to a close, this expansion introduces the Prismatic subclass, which allows you to combine Arc, Solar, Void, Statis, and Strand powers into the perfect subclass of your own design.Star Wars: HuntersRelease Date: June 4Platforms: Android, iOS, Nintendo SwitchWhile Star Wars Outlaws—set to release late this summer—is getting all the attention right now, it's not the only Star Wars game on the horizon. June will bring us Star Wars: Hunters.Get ready for video game buzzwords: This is a free-to-play, player-versus-player competitive arena game with a cast of all-new characters cast from familiar molds. Character types include a Wookie, a Trandoshan, and a Rodian. There are bounty hunters, Jedi, and scavengers.Picking from the varied list of characters, you'll participate in the kind of modes you know and love from other games. There's a team deathmatch-style mode called Squad Brawl, a Domination-style one called Power Control, and a capture-the-flag or keep away-style game called Trophy Chase. Again, this game is free-to-play, and it's on all of the most popular mobile platforms, so it's worth a look if you're itching for a Star Wars experience right now.Killer Klowns From Outer Space: The GameRelease Date: June 4Platforms: PC, PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|SHorror movies are almost perfect subject matter for asynchronous multiplayer, where some players are powerful, seemingly immortal beings and others are hapless victims who can do little but escape. The formula works in Dead by Daylight and The Texas Chainsaw Massacre Game, but no one would've bet money on the 1988 cult classic horror movie “Killer Klowns from Outer Space” getting its own adaptation.In this adaptation, three players take control of one of five unique Klowns—a race of malevolent clown-like aliens who come to earth to prey upon humans—while seven others play as the townspeople of Crescent Cove, and must avoid the Klowns and their hilariously horrifying weapons. In the movies, that includes a popcorn bazooka, cotton candy cocoons, sentient balloon animals, people-shrinking shadow puppets, and more. In zombie movies, you aim for the head. In Klown movies, you aim for the nose.Still Wakes the DeepRelease Date: June 18Platforms: PC, PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|SSet in December 1975, Glaswegian electrician Caz McLeary is trapped aboard an oil rig off the coast of Scotland when disaster strikes. The player, as McLeary, must survive not only the dangerous weather and deteriorating oil rig but also the pursuit by a mysterious monster now aboard the rig. With Still Wakes the Deep, developer The Chinese Room returns to narrative horror. This studio previously worked on Amnesia: A Machine for Pigs, Dear Esther, and Everybody's Gone to the Rapture.Elden Ring: Shadow of the ErdtreeRelease Date: June 21Platforms: PC, PlayStation 4/5, Xbox One, Xbox Series X|SMuch like an Elden Ring player dodging the Fire Giant, other games are dodging the release of Elden Ring: Shadow of the Erdtree. Elden Ring was one of the best-reviewed and best-selling games of 2022, so this expansion is almost certain to be massive.This expansion will bring a large new area to explore, new weapons and equipment to use, and new enemies and bosses to repeatedly die to… and then triumphantly defeat. The new area itself, the Land of Shadow, is reportedly as large as Elden Ring's first area, Limgrave. That's not huge in comparison to the overall Elden Ring map—but the Elden Ring map is gigantic, so we're expecting to have plenty to do.Luigi's Mansion 2 HDRelease Date: June 27Platforms: Nintendo SwitchFor our US-based readers, you might remember Luigi's Mansion 2 as Luigi's Mansion: Dark Moon, the name it was released with in the United States in 2013. Everywhere else, it was just called Luigi's Mansion 2. Luigi's Mansion 2 HD updates the Nintendo 3DS game for the Switch with new visuals, leaving the game otherwise largely intact. The game will also feature cooperative multiplayer for up to four players.Edited by Andrew HaywardGG NewsletterGet the latest web3 gaming news, hear directly from gaming studios and influencers covering the space, and receive power-ups from our partners.

Hedge Funds Net Short on Bitcoin and Ethereum Futures on CME: Kaiko Analytics - The Daily Hodl


								New data from market intelligence firm Kaiko Analytics shows that hedge funds are net short on Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME).
In a new research article, the crypto analytics platform says that while hedge funds are net short on both BTC and ETH on the CME, it does not mean the funds are bearish on crypto, but rather, that they are engaging in basis trades, a type of arbitrage strategy.










Net short means that the hedge funds have accumulated more short positions than long positions in the crypto derivatives markets.
Says Kaiko Analytics,
“This doesn’t necessarily mean these funds are bearish on crypto, it’s more likely they’re engaging in one of crypto’s most popular trades, the basis trade. 
The basis trade is a type of arbitrage strategy that exploits the price difference between two similar assets. In this case between an BTC or ETH spot and futures. Hedge funds are likely ‘long basis’ at present. This means they are selling futures short while holding spot BTC or ETH. 
This protects against price moves and guarantees a specific sale price in the event of volatility in the underlying asset. The long basis trade works best when prices are in a state of contango, which means futures prices are above spot prices. The two prices will trend towards one another as expiration nears.
While we don’t have the data to say with certainty that this is why hedge funds are net short, it’s the most likely explanation for the massive short positions held by these sophisticated traders, who would rarely short without hedging.”

Position trader profits $13 million (345%) with the 'Nvidia of crypto'


    A position trader has booked an estimated $13.2 million (345%) profit in seven months of buying and holding patiently. Render (RNDR)—this position trade’s cryptocurrency, became known as the “Nvidia of crypto”—creating a decentralized network of GPU rendering.



Notably, SpotOnChain reported the seven-month position trade that started with a 1.69 million RNDR purchase on Coinbase. The withdrawals happened between November 2 and November 10, 2023. At that time, this position was valued at around $3.83 million, with Render priced at $2.265 on average.



This trader became dormant for seven months after building the position, waiting patiently for the best time to sell. Interestingly, the whale missed Render’s price top in March but remained still even during a significant crash in April.







The trader decided to take profits as the price recovered, moving their whole Render stack to Coinbase on May 24. In particular, the 1.69 million RNDR were priced at $17.03 million by the time of the activity. Thus, the position trader’s estimated profit was $13.2 million, up 345% from the initial investment in November last year.

What is position trading, and how does it benefit traders?



Position trading is a long-term strategy that involves holding positions for weeks, months, or even years.



This approach allows traders to capitalize on significant market trends and capture substantial profits over time. By focusing on the bigger picture, position traders can avoid the noise and volatility of short-term price fluctuations.



Moreover, this strategy requires less time and effort compared to other trading styles, such as day trading. Position traders can conduct thorough research and analysis to identify high-quality assets with strong fundamentals and growth potential.



Additionally, by holding positions for extended periods, position traders can benefit from compound returns and potentially lower transaction costs. However, it’s essential to manage risk effectively and have patience when employing this strategy.



RNDR: The ‘Nvidia of crypto’ price analysis



Render has been dubbed the “Nvidia of crypto” due to its strong performance and alignment with AI and GPU sectors. The RNDR token saw a 345% increase from November 2023 to May 2024, driven by the market’s interest in AI-related assets.



Furthermore, Render’s decentralized GPU rendering solutions democratize access to high-quality rendering, mirroring Nvidia’s impact on the gaming industry. The growing demand for GPU-intensive applications aligns with Render’s focus on providing GPU computing power for various tasks.



As of May 26, RNDR had a market cap of $3.9 billion, trading at $10.15, indicating significant growth potential and investor confidence.

Position traders have looked into the “Nvidia of crypto” for solid investments that are now rendering fruits.

XRP to 'make extraordinary moves' after clearing this level


    The price of XRP continues to consolidate above the $0.50 support level, and a crypto analyst has suggested that the token has the potential for further upside if it breaches several resistance marks.



Based on the token’s technical analysis, the analyst, Dark Defender, suggested in an X post on May 26 that XRP is on the brink of breaking through a critical resistance zone. This breakthrough could trigger a substantial price surge.



In making the prediction, the analyst focused on the Heikin Ashi Candles combined with the Fisher Indicator. He explained that this method effectively identifies trends by analyzing highs, lows, and opening and closing prices over a specified time frame.







According to the expert, combining these indicators provides a smoother trend direction, making it easier to predict potential market movements. Based on his chart analysis, the analyst pointed out that XRP’s challenging zone lies between $0.6044 and $0.6649.

Key technical indicators to watch 



Dark Defender emphasized that once the weekly candle closes above $0.6649, XRP will gain much stronger momentum, allowing it to move toward higher Fibonacci levels.




“Based on the Heikin Ashi Candles & Fisher Indicator, one of my favourites, indicates the trend shift clearly on the weekly time frame.<…> Once the weekly candle closes above $0.6649, XRP will be much stronger. <…> We are in Grand Wave 3, and XRP will make extraordinary moves above $0.6049,” the expert said. 




To substantiate his analysis, Dark Defender pointed to the Ichimoku Clouds, confirming the Fibonacci levels within the identified resistance range. Notably, the Ichimoku Cloud is a technical indicator that can assess potential future price movements and identify key support and resistance levels.



It’s worth noting that XRP remains at the center of the crypto market, with the token failing to make any substantial price movement. Since losing the $0.60 support, the token continues to hover above $0.50. Notably, XRP investors seek an opportunity to aid the token’s rally to the coveted $1 mark.



In the meantime, XRP is facing long-term bullish sentiments that could positively influence its price. For instance, following the Securities and Exchange Commission’s (SEC) approval of an Ethereum (ETH) spot exchange-traded fund (ETF), speculation is rife that a similar product might receive the green light for XRP, with experts projecting it could happen in 2025.



At the same time, investors closely watch the ongoing legal proceedings between Ripple and the SEC. A ruling in favor of the blockchain firm could act as a bullish catalyst for XRP.



Additionally, optimism about the case emerged after Coinbase announced that the crypto exchange had relisted the digital token for its clients in New York. Coinbase removed the token from its US markets in 2021 due to a lawsuit. Therefore, XRP could rally as Coinbase’s move may renew investors’ optimism and confidence in the asset.



XRP price analysis



By press time, XRP was trading at $0.53 with daily losses of about 0.23%, while the weekly timeframe indicates gains of about 2.5%.

Despite the extended consolidation of XRP, the token’s bullish momentum has remained steady. The stability above $0.50 hints at a possible surge to the $0.60 mark soon, a level that could pave the way toward $1.

Coinbase and SEC Reach Fresh Agreement on Document Handling: Details - Coin Edition


							

Coinbase and SEC submitted a joint Stipulation and Proposed Protective Order to the court.
The agreement includes provisions for resolving disputes and handling inadvertent sharing of protected information.
Coinbase has moved to challenge the SEC’s interpretation of investment contracts.




U.S.-based exchange Coinbase and the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) have reached a consensus on handling sensitive documents. In particular, on May 24, a Stipulation and Proposed Protective Order was submitted in a letter to presiding Judge Katherine Polk Failla.









This agreement ensures that the court can enforce the terms should any breaches be alleged in the lawsuit between the SEC and Coinbase. In the letter, both parties acknowledged their commitment to good faith cooperation regarding document requests and production. The agreement outlines a process for addressing any questions related to reductions, categories, metadata, or assertions of privilege in the documents produced.



Additionally, the agreement includes a clause for inadvertent sharing of protected information, requiring the disclosing party to notify the other promptly, specifying the information and the basis for the claim of privilege. The receiving party is then obligated to return, destroy, or sequester any copies of the protected information within five days of receipt.



Meanwhile, Coinbase challenged the SEC’s interpretation of investment contracts in the ongoing legal dispute on Friday, arguing that the SEC is bypassing established case law and the Howey test. 



Coinbase’s appeal contests the March ruling that supported the SEC’s claim that Coinbase’s staking program is an unregistered securities offering. The exchange asserted that investment contracts require a post-sale contractual commitment, which the SEC disputes. 



The case highlights inconsistencies with the SEC’s approach in similar cases. Notably, the SEC’s lawsuit from June 2023 accuses Coinbase of securities law violations, including listing 13 cryptocurrencies as securities. 



Accordingly, Coinbase actively campaigns for crypto industry defense through initiatives like the Stand With Crypto campaign and a political action committee.

Crypto Hiring: Crypto exchange names new CEO; Tokenization-focused firm expands - Blockworks


A crypto exchange named a new CEO and a tokenization-focused firm picked a leader for its new office in Canada. 
Gracy Chen is set to replace Sandra Lou as Bitget’s chief executive, the company said Tuesday. 
Chen had joined Bitget as a managing director in 2022 and was tasked with leading the company’s growth strategies.   
The crypto exchange launched a crypto-backed credit card last year usable wherever Visa is accepted and is “developing more services to support this integration,” Chen noted in a letter. 
Investing in the crypto ecosystem via the exchange’s Web3 Fund and EmpowerX Fund also remains “a key long-term focus,” she added.

Meanwhile, crypto infrastructure firm Taurus opened its first North America office in Vancouver, Canada. 
Andrew Maledy — previously an engineering manager at Procore Technologies — is set to lead the office as the company links up with regional partners and clients of its custody and tokenization technology.
Taurus raised $65 million in a February funding round led by Credit Suisse. Deutsche Bank took part in that round too — linking up with Taurus in September to build out digital asset custody and tokenization services.  
The company gained approval from the Swiss Financial Market Supervisory Authority (FINMA) in January to open its digital assets marketplace to retail clients.

                        The recent approval of Ethereum exchange-traded funds (ETFs) has opened the doors for more crypto investment products, according to research from TD Cowen’s Washington Research Group.While the speed of approval caught some off guard, the research group viewed it as an inevitable outcome following the approval of Bitcoin ETFs earlier this year.Jaret Seiberg, a member of TD Cowen’s team, noted that the Ethereum ETF approval came about six months earlier than expected but was predictable after the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) gave the green light to crypto futures ETFs.ETFs Including Basket of Crypto Tokens Could Come Next
Seiberg further suggested that within the next year, we could see investment offerings that include a “basket of crypto tokens,” encompassing Bitcoin and ٍther, and potentially even more.However, the approval of Ethereum ETFs does not indicate a broader shift in the SEC’s stance on cryptocurrencies.SEC Chair Gary Gensler, known for his critical stance on the crypto industry, issued a critical statement regarding the passage of crypto legislation that could potentially diminish the agency’s authority.Gensler highlighted the industry’s history of failures, frauds, and bankruptcies, attributing them not to a lack of rules but to many players in the crypto industry disregarding the existing regulations.His statement was released before the Financial Innovation and Technology for the 21st Century Act, or FIT 21, passed in the U.S. House of Representatives.While Gensler’s agency may face challenges, TD Cowen predicts that the SEC will maintain its Democratic majority until 2026.The research group expects the agency to continue litigating against crypto trading platforms that trade tokens deemed unregistered securities by the SEC.Spot Ether ETF Approval Proves ETH is Not a Security
The recent approval of spot ETH ETFs potentially confirms Ether’s status as a non-security, according to industry experts.As reported, Bloomberg ETF analyst James Seyffart has said that the approval of these commodity-based trust shares implies that the SEC explicitly recognizes Ether as not being a security.Seyffart further suggested that this recognition could extend to other tokens as well, solidifying their classification as commodities.Digital asset lawyer Justin Browder echoed Seyffart’s sentiment, stating that if Ether ETFs receive S-1 approval, which is the final requirement for them to begin trading, it would settle the debate once and for all, affirming that ETH is indeed not a security.Adam Cochran, a partner at venture capital firm Cinneamhain Ventures, took the argument a step further, suggesting that this line of thinking could be applied to tokens of other projects as well.On May 23, the SEC officially approved 19b-4 applications from VanEck, BlackRock, Fidelity, Grayscale, Franklin Templeton, ARK 21Shares, Invesco Galaxy, and Bitwise for issuing spot Ether ETFs.Notably, several ETF issuers removed staking from their final amendments.Seyffart predicts that the S-1 approvals could be granted in a “couple of weeks,” although he acknowledges that the process may take longer, typically spanning up to five months.However, fellow Bloomberg ETF analyst Eric Balchunas believes that a mid-June launch is certainly possible.

Bitcoin or NVIDIA? We asked ChatGPT-4o which investment offers better long-term potential


    As Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) continues to impress with its technological advancements and robust stock performance, a growing conversation among investors and experts centers on whether the tech giant can maintain its edge over Bitcoin (BTC) in the coming decade. 



However, current market conditions and predictions leave investors wondering which of these two investments will perform better in the long term.



To address this question, Finbold asked ChatGPT-4o to analyze the long-term investment potential for Bitcoin and Nvidia and recommend which one could offer better long-term growth prospects. 







The AI model was given the following prompt:




Given the recent expert assessments that NVIDIA has a ‘near zero chance’ of outperforming Bitcoin over the next decade, please conduct an in-depth, objective comparison of the long-term investment potential for Bitcoin and NVIDIA. Focus on analyzing key factors such as technological innovation, market adoption rates, regulatory environment, and financial stability. Consider the implications of Bitcoin’s incorporation into ETFs and the impact of NVIDIA’s technological advancements in AI and gaming on its market performance. Utilize the latest market data and expert insights to determine which investment offers better prospects for long-term growth. Provide a well-supported conclusion that assesses the risks and benefits associated with each investment.




ChatGPT-4o: Bitcoin (BTC) Emerges as the Better Investment Option



ChatGPT-4 named Bitcoin as the better investment option for long-term growth. Notably, it highlighted Bitcoin’s integration into mainstream financial products and its decentralized nature as significant advantages.

While Bitcoin faces regulatory uncertainty, the evolving regulatory environment trends towards greater acceptance, potentially enhancing its stability.



Despite its high volatility, Bitcoin’s decentralized nature offers resilience against centralized control and inflation. Experts emphasize its higher growth potential and significant historical returns, making it a strong candidate for long-term investment.



On the other hand, Nvidia offers a more stable and predictable investment with strong growth potential driven by technological advancements in AI and gaming.



 However, ChatGPT-4o notes that Bitcoin presents a higher risk-reward scenario with its revolutionary technology and increasing adoption as a digital asset.



Nvidia and BTC analysis: A comparative look at market performance

From January 1, 2024, to May 26, 2024, BTC-USD and Nvidia demonstrated distinct trading patterns and growth trajectories, reflecting their unique market positions and investor sentiments. 



Bitcoin exhibited significant volatility, with prices ranging from approximately $39,450 to $73,750, leading to a 63% YTD increase. This substantial growth underscores Bitcoin’s potential for significant returns, albeit with higher risk.



In contrast, Nvidia displayed strong growth, with its stock price increasing from $475 to $1,064, marking a YTD rise of about 115%. This impressive performance highlights Nvidia’s robust position in the semiconductor industry and its continuous innovation in AI and gaming.



Investors seeking stability and steady growth may prefer Nvidia, which benefits from its established position in the semiconductor industry and its continuous innovation in AI and gaming.



 Meanwhile, those willing to take on higher risk for potentially greater returns may find Bitcoin more appealing due to its innovative nature, market adoption, and growth prospects.



Ultimately, the choice between Bitcoin and Nvidia depends on individual risk tolerance and investment goals. Bitcoin’s potential for substantial growth in the evolving digital currency market makes it an attractive option for long-term investors willing to navigate its volatility.

New Solana Memecoin RIP DOGEY (RIPDOGEY) to Skyrocket 18,000% as KuCoin Listing Announced, While Shiba Inu and Dogecoin Struggle



                    

RIP DOGEY (RIPDOGEY) could turn early investors into multi-millionaires if it becomes a mainstream coin, like Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE).



RIP DOGEY (RIPDOGEY), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is poised to explode over 18,000% in price in the coming days.




This is because RIPDOGEY has announced its first centralized exchange listing, which will be on KuCoin.



This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up.



Currently, RIP DOGEY can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jupiter and Raydium, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days.




Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and RIP DOGEY could become the next viral memecoin.



RIP DOGEY launched with over $6,000 of locked liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains.



To buy RIP DOGEY on Raydium or Jupiter ahead of the KuCoin listing, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for RIP DOGEY by entering its contract address – GVZoEtPFj1fMuW2zA4Zww27Mcx1yJSobrW3hzp5hfqCe – in the receiving field.



In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price.




If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner.



The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum.



This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like RIPDOGEY.

Rabbit AI Denies Coffeezilla’s Allegations of NFT Scam and Overhyped Products, Cites Transparency and User Feedback



                    

Artificial intelligence (AI) company Rabbit has refuted some allegations made by YouTube investigator Stephen Findeisen, also known as “Coffeezilla.” Rabbit maintains that it has been open about its rebranding and transition into AI.



On May 22, Findeisen accused Rabbit of being involved in a nonfungible token (NFT) scam and attempting to cover it up. 




He highlighted the company’s rebranding from Cyber Manufacture to Rabbit, which he suggested was done discreetly.



Findeisen also alleged that Jesse Lyu, Rabbit AI’s founder and CEO, failed to deliver on promises made to supporters of the Gama NFT project. 



He criticized Rabbit’s new Rabbit R1 AI product as being “overhyped,” akin to the NFT project he labeled a “scam.”




In response, a Rabbit spokesperson told Cointelegraph that Rabbit and the Gama project were distinct ventures under the same umbrella. 



They cited a 2023 tech media article confirming the rebranding from Cyber Manufacturing to Rabbit.



The spokesperson emphasized that most current employees joined after the rebranding, stating that over 80% of Rabbit’s staff were hired post-December 2023, a few months after the rebrand.

The spokesperson also addressed the Gama project’s conclusion, asserting:“Jesse strongly disputes Coffeezilla’s allegations that he and the Gama team were not forthright about the open-sourcing of the project, which had the support of investors, and his shift in focus to AI hardware.”



They further noted that Lyu has a history as an entrepreneur and was involved in various projects, including Gama. 



The spokesperson explained that the Gama project ended before Rabbit was founded and added, “At the end of the day, many companies do pivot.”



Regarding Findeisen’s comments on the Rabbit R1, the spokesperson said they are actively gathering feedback from users. 



They noted that 10,000 users have generated over 600,000 interactions with the product in the past thirty days.



The company also mentioned that they have released updates based on user feedback and are launching new features continuously.

Gate.HK Shuts Down After Failing to Meet Hong Kong's New Crypto Licensing Requirements



                    

Hong Kong-based cryptocurrency exchange Gate.HK has shut down after failing to meet the upcoming local licensing requirements set to take effect on June 1. 



The Hong Kong Securities and Futures Commission (SFC) mandated that all crypto exchanges in the region acquire an operational license, requiring those that failed to apply to cease services by May 31.




Gate.HK applied for a license on February 28, but withdrew the application on May 22, citing the need for a “major overhaul” of its trading platform.



As of May 23, Gate.HK has stopped acquiring new users and ceased all marketing activities. 



Current users can no longer make deposits and are only able to withdraw funds until August 28. 



The exchange will permanently delist all tokens, including Bitcoin, Ether, Solana, Polygon (MATIC), and Tether (USDT), on May 28, effectively shutting down its trading platform.



Gate.HK plans to relaunch its services once its platform is reconstructed to comply with Hong Kong’s regulatory requirements, which include establishing Anti-Money Laundering and Counter-Terrorist Financing measures. 



The company stated, “Gate.HK is actively working on the aforementioned overhaul.

“We plan to resume our business in Hong Kong in the future and contribute to the virtual asset ecosystem after obtaining the relevant licenses.”



The closure of Gate.HK coincides with the announcement of another major global exchange, OKX, which stated on May 24 that it would exit the Hong Kong market. 




OKX will cease providing centralized virtual asset trading services to Hong Kong residents by May 31, 2024. 



The announcement reassured customers, saying, “Customer funds remain safe, and withdrawal services will not be affected. After May 31, 2024, customers can only withdraw.”



Prior to Gate.HK’s exit, three other exchanges — Huobi HK, QuanXLab, and IBTCEX — also withdrew their license applications in May.



Additionally, a recent Bloomberg report indicated that the SFC is considering allowing spot Ether exchange-traded fund (ETF) issuers to include an ETH staking option to generate passive income. 



The SFC is currently discussing providing staking services via licensed platforms with the country’s crypto ETF issuers, although no timeline for implementation has been set.

Kiyosaki names investment's 'biggest lie,' reveals assets to buy before price explosion


    Financial author and investor Robert Kiyosaki, known for his best-selling book “Rich Dad Poor Dad,” has warned about what he considers the “biggest lie” in the financial industry.



In an X post on May 25, Kiyosaki claimed that the lie emanates from financial planners who deceive “gullible, mom and pop investors” by promoting the safety of bonds.



Consequently, Kiyosaki warned investors, including those deemed sophisticated, that they risk significant losses when AAA bonds—bonds with the highest credit rating—plummet as the commercial real estate market falters.







Kiyosaki also cautioned that the current state of the office real estate market could lead to a catastrophic crash, leaving investors vulnerable to significant losses. He predicted that this inability to meet financial obligations would precipitate the crash of AAA bonds.




“BIGGEST LIE financial planners tell gullible, mom and pop investors: The lie is: “Bonds are safe.”  Millions of even so-called “sophisticated” investors will take losses when so-called AAA bonds crash,” he said. 




Such a downturn, he suggested, would disproportionately impact investors who are considered sophisticated but may have been lulled into a false sense of security by the high credit ratings of these bonds.



Interestingly, the warning comes when the U.S. Treasury bonds have deviated from a 40-year uptrend, implying possible economic vulnerabilities. 



Assets to invest in 



From his perspective on the financial landscape, Kiyosaki recommended that investors pivot to “safer real assets.” He specifically pointed to gold, silver, and Bitcoin (BTC) as preferable alternatives. 




“Best get into safer real assets such as gold, silver, and. Bitcoin before their prices explode,” the investor added. 




Indeed, Kiyosaki’s latest perspective on economic health aligns with his long-standing warnings about a possible market crash. As reported by Finbold in early May, the financial educator cautioned that a crash had already begun and is likely to worsen.



Notably, Kiyosaki has blamed some U.S. government policies for the situation. He has specifically accused the Federal Reserve of doing little to tame inflation while warning that the levels of U.S. debt could have catastrophic consequences.



He maintains that the U.S. is “bankrupt” and predicts that nearly every asset class and type, including stocks, bonds, and real estate, will crash.



In the meantime, the investor has emphasized that gold, silver, and Bitcoin are the main assets to cushion from any crash.

Elizabeth Warren and Anti-Crypto Movement Losing Their Battle, According to Former CFTC Chairman: Report - The Daily Hodl


								The former Chair of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) reportedly says that Senator Elizabeth Warren and her anti-crypto agenda are losing their battle.
In a new interview with Forbes, former CFTC Chairman Christopher Giancarlo reveals that he’s bullish on the future of digital assets and says that the anti-crypto wing is a “shrinking iceberg.”










According to Giancarlo, the legislative climate in the US is shifting toward crypto assets, as evidenced by both chambers of Congress passing the reversal of SAB 121.
SAB 121 is a guidance note from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) published in March 2022 which tells entities how to account for and safeguard their digital assets.
Last week, the bill overturning the SEC guideline passed the Senate in a 60-38 vote.
But Giancarlo notes that the White House may veto the bill, a move traditional banks would likely back.
 “I think [the passage of SAB 121 reversal] says that the Elizabeth Warren wing is a shrinking iceberg… 
Notwithstanding some parts of the banking system that may be resistant to digital asset innovation, forcing them to reserve a hundred percent against their holdings effectively means banks can’t be a player in this innovation. I think the rejection of this is there. 
So the White House may veto this, but I think it puts them in an increasingly untenable position against the tide of history, against the tide of innovation.” 
Moving on to FIT21, a more recent crypto bill that would give the CFTC regulatory jurisdiction over digital asset commodities, Giancarlo says that it could work since the CFTC has shown it can regulate non-wholesale markets before.
“The reason why [the CFTC is] mostly a wholesale regulator is because it oversees futures markets, which, for the most part, have professional traders in them. It doesn’t oversee spot markets where you’ve got a lot of retail traders. 
This act would give CFTC market supervision regulation power over spot markets for crypto and not just the derivative markets. 
Therefore, the CFTC would find itself, to some degree, engaging in retail marketplace supervision. My mind has evolved on this in part because the CFTC already has certain pockets of retail supervision, and it’s shown itself to be able to handle them very well.”

'Dollar is the most widely traded crypto,' dunks senior commodity analyst


    According to a senior commodity analyst, Bitcoin’s (BTC) volatility puts it behind gold and the U.S. dollar in some investment perspectives. Meanwhile, BTC may crash harder than the stock market during a recession.



Mike McGlone, senior commodity analyst for Bloomberg, spoke about the market’s volatility in a panel at Bitcoinday Miami this week. On that occasion, McGlone highlighted how Tether’s dollar stablecoin (USDT) trades twice as much as Bitcoin on a usual day.




“Right now, I can have access to the U.S. dollar any place in the world from my phone [with] Tether. Tether is the number one trading token. It’s the number one trading crypto. It doubles the value in a typical day over Bitcoin. It’s the dollar. The whole world has gone to the dollar. Why? Because it’s the least worst of all fiat currencies.”
Mike McGlone








Notably, the senior analyst is enthusiastic about Bitcoin as a hedge commodity that companies will be exposed to. However, he is also skeptical about the leading cryptocurrency‘s other properties, including its competitive advantages against other commodities and currencies.







Bitcoin would crash harder than stocks in a recession



Mike McGlone played an antagonist role on the thematic panel, raising concerns about Bitcoin as an investment asset. He mentioned that stablecoin issuers back their U.S. dollar peg with treasury bonds, suggesting a low-volatility preference.



Moreover, the commodity expert highlighted gold as the preferred option for central banks trying to hedge their Treasuries. To illustrate these claims, Mike McGlone explained that stocks are about to crash amid an expected recession against key finance indicators, but Bitcoin will suffer more.




“So, please be concerned about beta [of volatility]. (…) $55 trillion is the total capitalization of the U.S. stock market. It’s two times GDP. That’s the most since 1937. That’s how expensive everything is right now. Bitcoin trades three times the volatility of the stock market on a normal basis. So, when—I didn’t say if—the stock market has a normal correction versus GDP, Bitcoin is more likely to go down initially. Gold is more likely to go up.”
Mike McGlone




Tether’s USDT trading volume against Bitcoin



Interestingly, Finbold retrieved data from Santiment, regarding Mike McGlone’s claims on the dollar being the most traded cryptocurrency and its relation to Bitcoin’s trading volume.



As of this writing, the USDT trading volume was at $41.76 billion, while Bitcoin’s was at $14.59 billion. This makes a 2.86:1 ratio of Tether’s U.S. dollar trading volume against BTC.

In conclusion, despite being enthusiastic about Bitcoin’s long-term forecasts, Mike McGlone remains skeptical about its capacities as a solid investment asset class or recession hedge. In his opinion, volatility plays an important role. Furthermore, the U.S. dollar and gold are superior assets for different reasons.

Coinbase Partners with Meta, Ripple, and Others to Combat Online Fraud


																Prominent US-based cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase announced the launch of a new initiative called ‘Tech Against Scams’ along with industry leaders Meta, Ripple, Gemini, Kraken, Match Group, and GASO.
This coalition aims to tackle online fraud and financial schemes while simultaneously protecting and educating users, highlighting that scams are a tech-wide issue, not restricted to social media, cryptocurrency, or finance.
In an official blog post, Coinbase said that the Tech Against Scams coalition serves as a primary convening body where participating tech companies will collaborate on ways to take action against the tools used by scammers, educate and protect consumers, and disrupt rapidly evolving financial scams.
This work will involve sharing best practices, threat intelligence, and other tips and information to help keep users safe and protected before they become victims of an online fraud scheme.
“By sharing insights and knowledge about the lifecycle of scams, we aim to provide resources to educate and protect consumers. Our collaboration across sectors will enhance visibility and help us develop evolving best practices to combat rapidly evolving scams, such as “pig butchering.”
Meanwhile, Coinbase also estimated that consumers across the world lose $1.4 trillion to financial scams every year.




In 2023, cases reported by the American public resulted in losses exceeding $12.5 billion due to online fraud, marking a 22% surge compared to the previous year, as revealed by the FBI’s annual Internet Crime Report.
Among digital crimes, the highest losses were led by investment frauds, reaching $4.57 billion, which represented a 38% increase from the previous year. The FBI further reported that approximately $4 billion of these losses were linked to cryptocurrency investment fraud.

Is Bitcoin Really Out Of The Danger Zone? Crypto Analyst Predicts Potential Dip - Benzinga

On Friday, pseudonymous trader and crypto analyst Rekt Capital provided insights into Bitcoin's BTC/USD current status and prospects.What Happened: The analyst said Bitcoin is no longer in the "danger zone" but warned of a possible 13% dip from its current value.In a post on X, he said that Bitcoin could still experience a significant decline. He explained that Bitcoin typically enters the "danger zone" after a halving event, which reduces miners' rewards.Following this phase, Bitcoin usually transitions into a "post-halving reaccumulation" period, characterized by sideways trading within a specific range. The analyst noted that Bitcoin had surged to $71,500 but faced resistance at this level, leading to ongoing consolidation.“Since the Bitcoin post-halving ‘danger zone’ ended, Bitcoin broke out to $71,500. However, ~$71,500 is where the range high resistance of the macro re-accumulation range is and this is where Bitcoin rejected from. The consolidation continues and history suggests it will continue for several more weeks between $60,000 and $70,000,” he said in the post. Also Read: Crypto Analyst Foresees Upswing In Bitcoin's Value Before Major PlungeIn another post, Rekt Capital also highlighted that historically, Bitcoin has struggled to break out of the range high on its first attempt post-halving. He suggested that this reaccumulation phase might last until September 2024, with Bitcoin potentially breaking out only up to 160 days after the halving event.“Historically, Bitcoin has always rejected from the range high on the first attempt at a breakout after the halving. Moreover, history suggests this re-accumulation should last much longer. Bitcoin tends to break out from these re-accumulation ranges only up to 160 days after the halving. That would translate to a Bitcoin breakout from the re-accumulation range only in September 2024," he said. Why It Matters: The potential for a 13% dip in Bitcoin's value comes amid broader bullish predictions for the cryptocurrency.Last week, another analyst projected that Bitcoin could reach $1 million within the next 10 to 18 months, emphasizing that the market is still in the early stages of Bitcoin's growth story. This optimistic outlook underscores the cryptocurrency market's volatility and speculative nature, where significant short-term fluctuations can coexist with long-term bullish trends.Now Read: Latest Bitcoin Halving Could Cost Miners Billions Of Dollars In Revenue: ReportThis content was partially produced with the help of AI tools and was reviewed and published by Benzinga editors.Photo: Shutterstock

Web3 Watch: CryptoPunked - Blockworks


A CryptoPunks-inspired digital avatar collection created by New York-based painter Nina Chanel Abney went on display in recent days. The blue chip NFT collection touted its use of 3D to “reimagine the viewing experience for Abney’s art through the Punk lens.”
When videos of the collection caused a stir online, Greg Solano, CEO of CryptoPunks intellectual property owner Yuga Labs, backtracked on the broader “Punk in Residence” initiative that made the Abney-CryptoPunks collaboration happen. 
“Yuga will no longer touch punks,” Solano vowed on X, formerly Twitter.
Yuga’s attempt to use the CryptoPunks intellectual property outside of its PFP collection comports with the Pudgy Penguins-popularized playbook of expanding NFTs beyond the initial avatars. If NFTs can prove ownership over intellectual property, the thinking goes: Why not expand the use of that intellectual property to things like gaming and plushy collectibles?

Yuga Labs is running a version of this strategy elsewhere with the Otherside metaverse game it’s building. 
Read more: Web3 Watch: Yuga Labs demos ‘Otherside’ metaverse, users left with mixed feelings
But for CryptoPunks, the most sought-after NFT collection by floor price, releasing the wonky three-dimensional figures proved a bridge too far. Some decried the collection as “woke.”
Perhaps punk holders don’t see much need to augment the collection’s popularity, as the collection’s heralded status still seems intact seven years after launching. 
Two so-called alien punks sold for over $16 million in March, the second- and third-largest sales in dollar terms in the collection’s history.

Abney expressed dismay over some of the criticism of her collection.
“I am utterly disgusted with some of the racist, sexist, homophobic, transphobic comments the controversy around this project has unearthed. [What’s] really at the underbelly of this space?” Abney wrote on X. 
Abney’s exhibition containing the CryptoPunks collection will be up in Kinderhook, NY until Oct. 5.
The Dogecoin doge crosses the rainbow bridge
Kabosu, the Shiba Inu whose likeness inspired Dogecoin, died Friday morning, the dog’s owner said on Instagram. 
“Kabosu crossed the rainbow bridge,” the owner wrote. “She went very peacefully without suffering, as if falling asleep while feeling the warmth of my hands petting her.”
A 2010 photo of Kabosu with a surprised-seeming expression would soon become the “doge” meme that led to the Dogecoin cryptocurrency’s launch in 2013. 
Since then, Dogecoin has become one of crypto’s paradigmatic memecoins and the ninth-largest crypto by market capitalization, per CoinGecko. Newer memecoins like Shiba Inu and BONK based themselves on the same dog breed in a likely hat tip to the original picture of Kabosu. 
One interesting stat:

BTC Maxi Michael Saylor Says Ethereum ETF Approval “Is Good for” Bitcoin - Coin Edition


							

Michael Saylor views the SEC’s approval of Ethereum ETFs as advantageous for Bitcoin’s political strength and industry support.
Saylor anticipates the move will hasten institutional adoption, with Bitcoin dominating the crypto allocation.
The crypto community is abuzz with Saylor’s unexpected positive shift on Ethereum ETFs.




Michael Saylor, the chairman of MicroStrategy, has expressed a positive outlook about the U.S. SEC’s approval of Ethereum spot ETFs, suggesting that it could be even more beneficial for Bitcoin. 









Saylor expressed this view during an episode of the “What Bitcoin Did” podcast on May 25. He discussed with host Peter McCormack the implications of the SEC’s decision to approve eight Ethereum spot ETFs on May 23.



Saylor, who had previously held reservations about the likelihood of SEC approval for Ethereum ETFs, has now shifted his stance. He sees the development as a potential catalyst that could bolster the entire crypto industry, including Bitcoin. In his words:




Yeah, I think it’s good for Bitcoin. In fact, it may be better for Bitcoin because we are politically much more powerful [when] supported by the entire crypto industry.




Furthermore, the MicroStrategy founder explained that the approval of Ethereum spot ETFs serves as an additional layer of defense for Bitcoin. He expects this development to speed up institutional adoption, as previously cautious investors may now recognize cryptocurrencies as a legitimate asset class. 



Saylor predicts that mainstream investors will allocate a portion of their portfolios to crypto, with Bitcoin receiving the majority share. He suggests that while investors might allocate 5% or 10% of their portfolio to the crypto asset class, Bitcoin will constitute 60% to 70% of that allocation.



Notably, Saylor’s previous stance was that Ethereum and other tokens like BNB, Solana, XRP, and Cardano would not receive the same treatment as Bitcoin. As a result, his change of heart has not gone unnoticed by the crypto community. Comments from industry figures like Joe Carlasare and Ricky Bobbyy reflect the surprise at Saylor’s “serious 180” degrees change, pondering whether he might start investing in ETH.

Will Dogecoin repeat 2021 highs? DOGE on the verge of 7x surge - AMBCrypto



Dogecoin’s price increased by more than 12% in the last seven days. 
Most market indicators and metrics looked bullish on the meme coin. 

Like most cryptos, Dogecoin [DOGE] was also enjoying a comfortable bull rally. However, things could get even better, as the meme coin seemed to be mimicking a pattern that it followed in a previous cycle. 
Dogecoin might repeat history
According to CoinMarketCap, DOGE bulls bucked up last week as the meme coin’s price surged by more than 12%. The bull rally was nowhere from stopping as DOGE’s price increased by over 4% in the last 24 hours. 
At the time of writing, DOGE was trading at $0.1724 with a market capitalization of over $29.4 billion. 
In the meantime, Mags, a popular crypto trader and analyst, posted a tweet highlighting an interesting development. 
Per the analyst, the accumulation phase has ended for Dogecoin, which is the precursor to a massive bull rally. In fact, the possible bull rally might allow DOGE to increase its price by sevenfold. 
Notably, this wasn’t the first time DOGE was acting like this. Mags’ tweet also pointed out a similar trend during DOGE’s last cycle in 2021. 
During that time, the end of DOGE’s accumulation phase triggered a bull rally, causing DOGE’s price to increase 170 times. 
Do metrics support a bull run?
AMBCrypto then analyzed Dogecoin’s on-chain data to see whether it also hinted at a continued price increase. 
As per our analysis, Whale Activity around DOGE remained high throughout the last week as its whale transaction counts increased. Its MVRV ratio increased, hinting more investors were in profit.
Its Velocity also remained up, meaning that DOGE was being used more often in transactions within a set timeframe. 
After a sharp decline, Dogecoin’s Weighted Sentiment improved, suggesting a rise in bullish sentiment. 
Source: Santiment
However, there were chances of DOGE witnessing a price correction soon. At press time, DOGE’s fear and greed index had a value of 64%, meaning that the market was in a “greed” phase. 
Whenever the metric reaches that level, it indicates that bears might step in and push an asset’s price down. Nonetheless, market indicators remained bullish on the meme coin. 

Realistic or not, here’s DOGE’s market cap in BTC terms

For instance, the Chaikin Money Flow gained upward momentum and was headed above the neutral mark.
 On top of that, the Money Flow Index (MFI) was also well above the neutral mark, hinting at a further price increase in the coming days.

How to Run Any AI App With Just a Few Clicks With Pinokio - Decrypt

There is undeniable appeal to running AI tools on your own computer, versus relying on online services offered by big tech players like OpenAI, Google, or Meta. But since most are published with software developers in mind, installing AI apps locally can get very complicated, very fast. (We have step-by-step guides for Stable Diffusion and FaceFusion, for example.)It's not hard to get lost while trying to find the AI models that are compatible with your computer, navigating a bunch of Github code repositories, copy-and-pasting weird commands into a command-line terminal, then untangling pruned, quantized, FP16 or FP8 or whatnot. There are tutorials out there, but they can't cover every edge case, and get obsolete fast.Could installing AI locally be as simple as clicking a button? Yes, say the makers of Pinokio, a new, user-friendly tool that is making waves in the open-source AI community.Pinokio is a Swiss Army knife for AI. It lets you run tools like image generators, video generators, music generators, uncensored AI chatbots, intelligent mirrors, and a whole lot more. And it can manage all this on your computer, for free. Provided you have capable-enough hardware, of course.Every one of the complex things that you used to do before Pinokio does for you automatically. With a few clicks, you'll be off and running.What is Pinokio?Pinokio is an AI browser that simplifies the installation and use of various AI applications and models on your local computer. Designed to be an all-in-one AI library downloader and manager, it consolidates the most popular open-source AI apps and puts them into a single environment, merging all the installation and configuration steps into simple scripts, running them with minimal user interaction.Pinokio features1. One-click installation: Pinokio allows you to install AI engines ranging from language models to visual tools like like Stable Diffusion with just one click. There's no need to worry about dependencies and custom environments.2. Wide availability of open-source AI models: Pinokio provides a robust catalog of installation scripts for leading open-source AI applications currently available, making it easy to find popular and new models and install the most up-to-date versions.3. One-click launch: Once AI apps are installed, you can fire them up them with one click. They run locally on your machine, so no internet connection is needed unless a specific app requires external API access.4. Browser-based controls: The applications are managed through a standard browser window. Pinokio provides a web view for many AI chatbots, Stable Diffusion, and other AI tools.5. Virtual computer: Pinokio is designed to be an autonomous virtual computer within your computer that can read, write, process, and execute anything through a simple scripting language.6. Privacy-oriented: All models run locally, and users don’t need to share any information with Pinokio. This means users don’t have to worry about sharing their data, being monitored, or otherwise being constrained by centralized, corporate AI developers.InstallationInstalling Pinokio is as straightforward as installing any other program or app. Just go to the official Pinokio website at pinokio.computer click the “download” button, select your operating system, and run the installation file.There is an additional step for Mac users, and yes, it is a terminal command. After you download the MacOS installer—a DMG file—and drop the "Pinokio" app into your Applications folder, you'll need to run the "patch.command" before opening the main app.Linux users must select the proper installation file according to their Linux distro and install it as usual. All the installation files are in this Github repository: https://github.com/pinokiocomputer/pinokio/releasesUse Pinokio to install your first open-source AI modelOnce Pinokio is installed, it’s time to explore. Pinokio lets you download and run any open-source AI app, as long as your computer can handle it.Remember, running AI apps usually requires a GPU with huge amounts of vRAM. So, if you want to play with AI, don't just buy the most powerful GPU. Instead, go with the most capable GPU. (We explain more here.) Invest in a GPU that has the most vRAM, in other words: 6GB is enough for running Stable Diffusion, but 12GB is a more flexible starting point for running some heavier models—or training your custom LoRAs or SD 1.5 models.Now it is time to navigate and run some AI apps. The process is the same for Windows, Mac or Linux.The first time you open Pinokio, you’ll see a simple, mostly blank screen.To explore the AI catalog, click the “Discover” tab along the top, or click the “Visit Discover Page” button. Pinokio will take you to a catalog of all the open-source AI models that you can run, each one with a corresponding image and description.Take a look around and find something you like. The ones we would recommend if you are just starting out are:
Fooocus (easy-to-use image generator)
Facefusion (deepfake generator)
SillyTavern (interact with LLMs)
ComfyUI, Invoke or Stable Diffusion WebUI (these three are also image generators)
The latter three image generators are a bit more complex than Fooocus, but they support SD 1.5, which uses less VRAM. If you have a beefier PC and want to tinker a little bit more with AI, you may want to download:
Openvoice (a voice cloner)
Devika (a multimodal AI agent capable of coding)
Moore Anymate Anyone or Stable Video Diffusion (AI video creation)
The catalog section looks like this:In this example, we’ll install Illusion Diffusion, which basically generates an image that is also an optical illusion. However, the steps are exactly the same for any model you download.Once you click on the app you want to install, it will take you to a new screen with basically just one button to press. It says “download”—so click it to do so.Once you select the model, it will ask you to provide the name you’d like it to use. You can let the default choice and click “download” once again.Pinokio will open a command prompt and download the script that will let you run the model. This occurs quickly and you’ll know it’s done because the command line says “done.”After it is finished, a new blank screen will appear. Note that it now displays the logo and name of the AI model you requested—in this case Illusion Diffusion—and three buttons: Delete, Files, and Install. Right now you want to click “Install.” However, "Delete" would uninstall the model and "Files" is used to explore the installation folder and mess around with files and folders—something you might do to add new checkpoints or LoRas if you installed Stable Diffusion.The screen looks like this:Now, as soon as you click "Install," another command-line screen like the one below should appear. While Pinokio does all this work for you, it may take some time to do it. Just wait and let Pinokio do its thing. It will download a lot of files, models, and libraries required to run your model. It will also set up environments and perform all the weird tweaks that are required to run your models on your machine.For transparency, you can audit everything in the command-line terminal window to see what's happening if you want.Pinokio will let you know when it’s safe to proceed to the next step with a nice popup letting you know that the installation was successful.Now that everything is installed, click the little plug icon on the left of your screen to launch your model.Don’t worry if you see yet another command line—it’s all part of the set up process. You should be used to waiting by now, so beware, you’ll probably have to wait some more.Once it is done, Pinokio will give you a local URL to run your model in your web browser of choice. It’s displayed at the end of the command line and is usually something like http://127.0.0.1—which means it is a link to your own machine, and that you can now run that model offline.Now you can play around with your AI. Just launch it by clicking on the rocket button on the left of your screen labeled “Open Web UI” and it will run in Pinokio’s native interface. If you want to run your model in full screen mode with your preferred web browser, just click the “popup” icon on top of the screen and it will open a new tab in your computer's default web browser.And there you go! Get crazy doing whatever you want with your new AI models.Pinokio is a game-changer for anyone interested in AI. It simplifies the download and install process, making AI accessible and enjoyable. Whether you're a seasoned AI enthusiast or a newbie just dipping your toes into the world of artificial intelligence, Pinokio is a great tool for you.Go ahead and give Pinokio a try.

Supreme Court Overrides Coinbase Agreement, Grants Courts Authority in Dogecoin Sweepstakes Disputes



                    

The United States Supreme Court has overridden Coinbase’s user agreement, granting district courts the authority to resolve sweepstakes disputes involving Dogecoin rewards.



In June 2021, Coinbase launched a Dogecoin sweepstakes promotional event, but the user agreement contained conflicting clauses about dispute resolution. 




Coinbase favored arbitration for resolving financial disputes, while users preferred court intervention. Both options were separately detailed in the platform’s agreements.



On May 23, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that state and federal courts will have exclusive jurisdiction over controversies related to Coinbase’s sweepstakes promotion.



“We conclude that a court, not an arbitrator, must decide whether the parties’ first agreement was superseded by their second. 




“The Ninth Circuit’s judgment is affirmed.”



Justice Neil Gorsuch, nominated by President Donald Trump in 2017, emphasized that arbitration is a matter of contract. 



He stated, “Parties (crypto exchanges and users) can agree by contract that an arbitrator, rather than a court, will resolve threshold arbitrability questions as well as underlying merits disputes.”



The Supreme Court dismissed Coinbase’s argument that the court’s approach could “invite chaos” by enabling challenges to delegation clauses.

“We do not believe that such chaos will follow,” the ruling added.



In the U.S., courts are not authorized to intervene in disputes when contracts exclusively contain an arbitration clause. 



However, when users agree to two contracts—one directing arbitrability disputes to arbitration and the other, either explicitly or implicitly, directing them to the courts—a court must decide which contract governs.



Coinbase recently experienced a significant outage affecting its trading services on mobile and desktop applications. 



On May 14, Coinbase Support’s official X account reported the outage, stating that it was investigating the issue and working on a solution. The account assured users that their funds were safe.



Cointelegraph visited the website, which displayed a “503 Service Temporarily Unavailable” error message. 



According to a developer guide on Mozilla, the most common cause of this error is that the servers are down for maintenance or are overloaded.

Arbitrage opportunity as Monero trades with a 10% premium on the streets


    Multiple cryptocurrency exchanges started delisting Monero (XMR) due to its privacy features, which have created arbitrage opportunities in parallel markets.



In particular, Monero is already the third most traded currency against Bitcoin (BTC) in the popular peer-to-peer no-KYC platform Bisq. The “privacy-by-default” cryptocurrency slightly loses in volume for the U.S. dollar (USD) and the euro (EUR) on Bisq.



As of this writing, the “Street Price” index on monero.boats calculate a $156.75 price for XMR. This index refers to coins being traded more organically, like cash, as if they were exchanged on the street.

The street price index is calculated using the last exchange rate of Monero against Bitcoin—Bisq’s base pair. XMR is currently at 0.00224374 BTC, showing a consolidation pattern following the sell-off from Binance’s delisting.

Monero price analysis and arbitrage



Notably, the TradingView price index shows Monero trades at an average of $143.09 on major exchanges. XMR has been showing strong momentum as the price recovers from Binance‘s delisting drop to $101, testing psychological support.



Before that, Monero’s exchange rate against the dollar was above $165, with a year-to-date high of $174.36. Technical indicators suggest a bullish forecast for the leading privacy coin trading above the 30-day exponential moving average (30-EMA). Moreover, its daily relative strength index (RSI) highlights the steady growth and future projections at 67.76.

Right now, there is a 9.5% premium for Monero exchanged on the “streets” than the trading price on exchanges. This presents traders with an arbitrage opportunity that could work as fuel for an incoming price surge on the mainstream.



However, it is important to understand that low-volume markets, like Bisq, usually follow the price of high-volume markets during arbitrages.



What is an arbitrage opportunity?



An arbitrage opportunity in trading arises when an asset trades at different prices in different markets. Traders can exploit this price discrepancy by simultaneously buying the asset in the lower-priced market and selling it in the higher-priced one.



The main risk associated with arbitrage is that prices may change quickly, eliminating the opportunity for profit. Traders must also consider transaction costs, which can erode potential gains.



In the case of Monero, the 9.5% premium in street markets presents an arbitrage opportunity. Traders could buy XMR on mainstream exchanges and sell it in parallel economies like Bisq to pocket the difference.



Nevertheless, they must be cautious of the risks associated with dealing in unregulated markets. Additionally, the limited liquidity in street markets may make it difficult to execute large trades without affecting prices. Despite the risks, the significant price difference between the two markets makes this an attractive opportunity for traders willing to navigate the challenges.

2 cryptocurrencies to reach $5 billion market cap in the first half of 2024


    As the cryptocurrency market rebounds from a recent downturn, investor sentiment is shifting positively, suggesting a potential upswing.



This surge is anticipated to push several altcoins beyond the $5 billion market cap mark, signifying a major milestone in their valuation and influence within the broader cryptocurrency landscape.



Finbold has highlighted two cryptocurrencies likely to surpass this threshold. These assets are nearing the milestone, with their trajectory dependent on the continuation of the bull run and factors like supply inflation. 







High supply inflation could increase their market cap even if their prices remain unchanged.



Aptos (APT)



Aptos (APT) recently set a new record in daily transaction volume, reaching 115 million transactions in a single day, surpassing Solana (SOL) and Sui (SUI) networks. The platform demonstrates impressive scalability, handling 32,000 transactions per second (TPS).



A key driver of this activity is the game Tapos Cat, which has significantly increased network usage.

Aptos is also expanding its ecosystem with strategic partnerships and integrations in the DeFi and NFT markets. Despite recent price volatility, its resilience and robust infrastructure support future growth. At press time, Aptos is trading at $9.14 with a market cap of $3.99 billion.



Render (RNDR)



Render (RNDR) offers blockchain-based rendering services for content creators and developers, driving its unique market appeal. Despite price fluctuations, Render has shown a steady upward trend, with a 23% increase in the past month and a 5% rise in the last week. 



This momentum has pushed its market cap considerably.



Render price and market cap. Source: CoinMarketCap



One of the reasons for the surge in price for AI tokens such as RNDR was the success of Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA). Nvidia’s achievements in the AI sector have significantly boosted market confidence, driving substantial gains for these tokens.



Recently, a position trader booked an estimated $13.2 million (345%) profit from Render. Nvidia’s progress in AI has led to significant gains for AI tokens, particularly after its earnings call.



Render’s growing ecosystem includes new partnerships and integrations with major digital content platforms and decentralized applications (dApps). This expansion enhances its utility and market presence. 



Currently, Render is trading at $10.02 with a market cap of $3.89 billion, showing strong potential to surpass its all-time high set in March 2024. 



Key technical indicators suggest continued upward momentum, making Render a compelling investment ahead of the anticipated market upswing.



As these platforms continue to innovate and expand their use cases, achieving a $5 billion market cap seems increasingly likely.



It’s worth noting that despite being supported by several fundamentals, the possibility of the highlighted cryptocurrencies reaching the $5 billion mark will largely depend on whether the market maintains a bullish momentum.

Onchain Data Reveals: This Altcoin Broke Two Records - Bitcoin Sistemi


According to Onchain data, an altcoin broke a new record in the number of daily transactions made by its users.
Aptoscan, the block explorer of the Aptos (APT) network, broke a new record with 97.48 million user transactions in one day on May 24. This record was previously held by another layer 1 blockchain network, Sui, with 65 million transactions.


In addition, Aptos users' TPS value, which is the transaction speed per second, reached 27,000, which is a record.
The reason for these records is thought to be a game released on the Aptos network.






Aptos, which has a market value of approximately $4 billion, is the 26th largest blockchain in the world at the time of writing. However, with the overall market rally and the approval of Ethereum Spot ETFs, Aptos' rise this week has been around 11%. This puts APT among the altcoins that have risen the most this week.
Aptos, which is listed on Binance, Coinbase and Upbit, among the world's largest cryptocurrency exchanges, is trading at a level much lower than the all-time high price record of $ 19.90, which was reached in January last year.

Buterin Sucks (BUTSUCKS) Will Skyrocket 14,000% Ahead of KuCoin Listing, as Shiba Inu, Bonk and Dogecoin Lag



                    

Early investors in memecoins like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Bonk (BONK) and Dogecoin (DOGE) made astronomical returns, and Buterin Sucks (BUTSUCKS) presents a similar opportunity for a limited time.



Buterin Sucks (BUTSUCKS), a newly launched Solana memecoin, is poised to explode over 14,000% in a matter of days, as former Shiba Inu (SHIB), Bonk (BONK) and Dogecoin (DOGE) investors pour funds into this new token.




BUTSUCKS will be listed on KuCoin, one of the largest centralized exchanges in the world, within a few days – and this is a massively bullish development for the token, as millions of new investors will easily be able to buy Buterin Sucks.



Currently, Buterin Sucks can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jupiter and Raydium, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days.



To buy BUTSUCKS on these platforms, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Buterin Sucks by entering its contract address – jr8okimfHEWaJpDmiZenkGWHzEr5bb53bDZf4kQvF7w – in the receiving field.




BUTSUCKS currently has a market cap of just under $12,000, with over $4,000 in locked liquidity, meaning it has huge upside potential.



Early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and Bonk (BONK) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price.



If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner.

Crypto Investor Loses $6.9 Million to Phishing Scam


A cryptocurrency investor recently lost millions to a sophisticated phishing scam. Scam Sniffer, a Web3 anti-scam firm, reported that the investor was tricked into signing a malicious Permit phishing signature. 
This authorization led to the theft of 1,807 Ether.fi-Liquid1 tokens, valued at $6.9 million. Moreover, blockchain investigator ZachXBT noted that the same investor fell victim to a phishing attack last year, losing $638,000.
Pink and Inferno Drainer Linked to Attack

The scam involved using a permit function, allowing an off-chain authorization signature to execute transactions on another address’s behalf. This method enabled the transfer of tokens without on-chain transactions, facilitating the theft.
The theft involved two wallets, 0xE56978, from the scammer and 0xFC4EA, belonging to a drainer. Notably, the stolen funds remain within these addresses.
Meanwhile, MistTrack, a crypto tracking and compliance platform built by SlowMist, found connections to the Pink and Inferno Drainers, notorious draining-as-a-service (DAAS) providers in the theft. The drainers offer scammers tools for phishing exploits, such as fake social media accounts and websites, in exchange for a cut of the stolen funds. BeInCrypto reported that these services were used to steal $295 million from 324,000 victims in 2023.

“Another huge amount of phishing, nearly 7 million USD of ETH pledged assets… from the old phishing gang Inferno Drainer. The reason is that the relevant permit offline authorization signature was phished away. Are there still many people who haven’t heard of the phishing tricks or rumors of ‘1click f#ck?’ I hope the victims can come forward to tell their own stories, especially what wallets they used,” Yu Xian, founder of SlowMist, commented.

Last week, Pink Drainer announced its retirement after amassing $85 million in stolen assets. Around the same period, Inferno Drainer resumed operations after a brief hiatus, citing increased demand and competitors’ exit.

This incident further shows that phishing attacks remain a prevalent method for stealing digital assets. Scammers often use fake accounts on social media platforms to impersonate legitimate projects. These accounts may display fake verification marks and post deceptive comments to lure users to malicious websites that drain their assets.

il Capo Discussed Bitcoin and the Long-Term Future of the Market in a Statement: How Will the US Elections Affect Prices? - Bitcoin Sistemi

Il Capo of Crypto, a renowned cryptocurrency analyst, recently shared his theory on the potential impact of the upcoming elections on the crypto market.
According to Il Capo, Donald Trump has already taken significant steps to gain votes from the crypto community. This strategy includes accepting campaign donations in cryptocurrencies, openly supporting the crypto industry, and promising to release Ross Ulbricht at the beginning of his term. Il Capo also predicts that Trump will announce significant tax benefits for crypto users.


Data shows that 14.4% of American adults own or use cryptocurrencies. However, when potential voters who are cryptocurrency users are considered, this rate increases to 22%. Il Capo states that a large part of this number would have voted for Trump before these statements, while another large part would not vote for Trump even with this new approach.
According to Il Capo, Democrats will sooner or later realize that they have lost this battle to win voters from the crypto industry.





Out of pride, they may decide to continue attacking the crypto ecosystem even harder rather than trying to win votes from the crypto community. Il Capo reminds that the US government holds approximately $15 billion worth of crypto and says they will probably sell these cryptos to raise money for the election campaign, to drive down prices to have more arguments to attack the industry, and to prevent leaving these assets to the next president.

Il Capo expects Trump to continue to take a pro-crypto stance in the coming months and Biden in the next few weeks. However, he predicts that Biden will eventually become even more aggressive towards the crypto industry. This would fit a scenario where prices continue to rise for a few more weeks but then see a significant correction before the elections (possibly from July-August to November).


According to Il Capo, the future of the market will depend on who will be elected. According to the analyst, if Trump is elected, 2025 could be a very good year for the market.

Woman To Serve About Seven Years Behind Bars for Laundering Bitcoin Proceeds of $6,400,000,000 Fraud: Report - The Daily Hodl


								A Chinese woman charged for her role in laundering the proceeds of a multi-billion dollar fraud scheme is now reportedly behind bars.
According to Reuters, Wen Jian was sentenced to six years and eight months in prison on Friday after jurors found her guilty of one count of money laundering in March.










Prosecutors say that Wen converted Bitcoin (BTC) into cash and property to hide the source of money that was purportedly stolen from nearly 130,000 investors in a $6.4 billion wealth scheme that took place in China between 2014 and 2017.
The scheme is believed to have been masterminded by another woman who fled to Britain in 2017 after Chinese authorities started their investigation. Wen allegedly served as the front person who helped convert the stolen funds into Bitcoin to take them out of China.
Wen denied the money laundering accusations, saying she did not have knowledge of criminality linked to Bitcoin. She claims she was just trying to give her son a better life, but prosecutors say she should have known that the money was illegally obtained.
Judge Sally-Ann Hales says there is no indication that Wen was involved in the underlying fraud, but reportedly told the 42-year-old that “no doubt that you knew” she was dealing with criminal property.
The case involves one of the largest cryptocurrency seizures by law enforcement in the world. In 2021, British police officers conducting investigations seized wallets with over 61,000 BTC valued at around $1.8 billion at the time. The confiscated BTC is now worth around $4.2 billion at Bitcoin’s current price of $69,227.61.

Trump Vows U.S. Dominance in Cryptocurrency Industry, Criticizes Biden's Stance



                    

The United States should aim for the top spot in the cryptocurrency industry, according to former U.S. President Donald Trump.



“Our country must be the leader in the field, there is no second place,” Trump asserted in a May 25 post on Truth Social, a social media platform owned by Trump Media and Technology Group (TMTG).




Expressing his enthusiasm for the burgeoning industry, Trump stated, “I am very positive and open minded to cryptocurrency companies, and all things related to this new and burgeoning industry.” 



He then criticized the current president, Joe Biden, his opponent in the upcoming 2024 presidential election, scheduled for November 4.



“CROOKED JOE BIDEN, ON THE OTHER HAND, THE WORST PRESIDENT IN THE HISTORY OF OUR COUNTRY, WANTS IT TO DIE A SLOW AND PAINFUL DEATH. THAT WILL NEVER HAPPEN WITH ME!” Trump proclaimed.




These remarks were made ahead of his planned speech at the Libertarian Party’s National Convention in Washington on the same day.

Trump’s recent positive stance on crypto has heightened industry expectations about his potential electoral success.



According to Polymarket, a New York-based crypto prediction platform, Trump currently has a 56% chance of winning the election, while President Joe Biden holds a 38% chance.




This comes shortly after Trump announced that his presidential campaign would accept cryptocurrency donations. 



On May 21, the Trump 2024 campaign launched a fundraising page allowing eligible donors to contribute in crypto via the Coinbase Commerce platform.



The website displayed logos for several cryptocurrencies, including Bitcoin, Ether, Dogecoin, Shiba, XRP, USD Coin, SOL, and 0x (ZRX).



In addition to his public endorsements of crypto, Trump has reportedly engaged with crypto enthusiasts.



Cointelegraph recently reported that individuals who purchased Trump’s “Mugshot” non-fungible tokens (NFTs) had the chance to dine with him on May 8 at his Mar-a-Lago residence.



This dinner was part of the agreement associated with buying the digital trading cards, which feature his mugshot taken during his surrender at the Fulton County Jail in Georgia.

JUST IN: Legendary Trader GCR Says Heavily Invested in This Altcoin, It's Actually Fake! He Reveals He Was Hacked - Bitcoin Sistemi


GCR, who has become almost legendary in the cryptocurrency market and is one of the most well-known analysts, announced today that he has a large investment in an altcoin via address X.

Donald Trump: 'I Will Ensure That The Future Of Crypto And Bitcoin Will Be Made In The USA' - Benzinga

Former President Donald Trump has doubled down on his support for cryptocurrencies, saying at the Libertarian National Convention that he would ensure that the future of crypto and Bitcoin BTC/USD “will be made in the USA.”What Happened: Trump also said he would support “the right to self-custody” and promised the audience to “keep Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) away” from their Bitcoin. Trump additionally reiterated his promise to “never allow the creation of a central bank digital currency.”During his speech, Trump promised to commute the sentence of Ross Ulbricht, the convicted Silk Road founder serving a double life sentence for his role in the marketplace’s creation.Prior to the event, Trump had written on his Truth Social social media platform that he is “positive and open-minded to cryptocurrency companies” and all things related to “this new and burgeoning industry.” He stated that the United States must be “the leader in this field” and accused President Joe Biden of wanting it “to die a slow and painful death.”See Also: Was Cathie Wood Right About Crypto As An Issue In 2024 White House Race? ‘You Can't Be On The Wrong SideWhy It Matters: The statement followed Trump’s recent embrace of cryptocurrencies, which marks a 180-degree turn from his position a few years ago when he called Bitcoin “a scam.”Over the last few weeks, Donald Trump started accepting cryptocurrency donations in Bitcoin, Ethereum ETH/USD, Dogecoin DOGE/USD, Shiba Inu SHIB/USD and the Trump-themed Maga Memecoin TRUMP/USD. He also vowed to build a “crypto army” in opposition to Warren’s “anti-crypto army.”Though some see Trump’s pivot towards crypto as “just another cow to milk,” Trump has been on the record saying that he is "having fun with crazy new currencies."His call to crypto supporters to “better vote for Trump” is seen by industry experts as a contributing factor to the Democratic Party softening its stance on restrictive cryptocurrency regulation.What’s Next: The role of crypto policy for the future of the digital asset space is expected to be thoroughly explored at Benzinga’s upcoming Future of Digital Assets event on Nov. 19.Read Next: Ethereum ETF Approved, Elon Musk Mourns Kabosu’s Death, Trump Embraces Crypto Donations And More: Top Cryptocurrency UpdatesImage: Shutterstock

What Michael Saylor Said About Ethereum After ETF Approvals


MicroStrategy executive chairman and co-founder Michael Saylor appears to be reassessing his stance on Ethereum after the US Securities and Exchange Commission’s (SEC) approval of spot exchange-traded funds (ETFs).
In the latest episode of the “What Bitcoin Did For Me” podcast, Saylor called the SEC’s decision positive news for Bitcoin and the entire crypto industry.
Ethereum ETF Approval Signals More Support for Crypto

According to Saylor, the SEC’s recent approval of several Ethereum ETFs showed the crypto industry’s growing political influence. Last week, the financial regulator unexpectedly approved several ETH-related financial instruments, with many industry insiders suggesting this reversal might have political motivations. 
As such, several stakeholders suggested the approval highlighted a positive shift in President Joe Biden’s stance towards cryptocurrencies.

“Is this good for Bitcoin or not? Yeah, I think it’s good for Bitcoin, in fact, I think it may be better for Bitcoin because I think that we are politically much more powerful and supported by the entire crypto industry,” Saylor said.

Michael Saylor believes the Ethereum ETFs will boost the institutional adoption of cryptocurrencies. According to him, more institutions will now recognize crypto as a legitimate asset class and allocate capital across various cryptocurrencies. However, he maintains Bitcoin would receive the largest share of these investments as the “leader” of the market.

“I think mainstream investors will say oh there is a crypto asset class now, maybe we’ll allocate 5% or 10% to the crypto asset class, but Bitcoin will be 60% or 70% of that,” Saylor noted.

The MicroStrategy chairman also seized the opportunity to express confidence in Bitcoin’s future. Saylor and his company hold a significant position in the top cryptocurrency and have consistently maintained a pro-BTC disposition. The Virginia-based company is the largest public holder of Bitcoin and has amassed over 214,000 BTC, valued at approximately $15 billion.

“I’m quite the optimist, I actually think that Bitcoin is going to succeed, it is succeeding, it’s succeeding as fast as it could reasonably succeed, and we ought to try to avoid the tendency to [mess] with it,” Saylor chimed.

Meanwhile, Saylor’s current stance on Ethereum has significantly shifted from his previous position. Earlier, he stated that the SEC would classify ETH as a security under its regulatory purview. He predicted that other cryptos, including BNB, Solana, and XRP, would suffer the same fate.

“None of [these tokens] will ever be wrapped by a spot ETF, none of them will be accepted by Wall Street, none of them will be accepted by mainstream institutional investors as crypto assets,” he claimed.

Trump Vows To Commute Sentence Of Silk Road Founder Ross Ulbricht Amid Boos And Jeers At Libertarian Convention - Benzinga

In a speech before the Libertarian National Convention on Saturday night where Donald Trump was consistently booed and jeered, the former president promised to commute the sentence of Ross Ulbricht, the creator of the online illegal drug marketplace Silk Road."And if you vote for me, on Day One, I will commute the sentence of Ross Ulbricht," Trump said, moments after mentioning his plans to pardon supporters who stormed the Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021.Ulbricht is serving a double life sentence for his role in creating the infamous Silk Road marketplace on the dark web that accepted nearly $1 billion in Bitcoin (BTC) for payments for the sale of heroin, cocaine, LSD and other illegal drugs.Trump's comments seemed geared toward Libertarian voters who generally support the legalization of all drugs and have long lobbied for the release of Ulbricht. Politico reported that Ulbricht supporters distributed hundreds of black and white signs reading "Free Ross" and "waved them manically in the moments after Trump's announcement."Libertarians garnered only 1.2% of the national vote in 2020, or about 1.8 million votes, but the 2024 election could be decided by very few votes in several battleground states.Meanwhile, Trump has called for the death penalty for drug dealers on various occasions, despite having pardoned several people convicted of selling drugs before he left office in January 2021.Seeking The Libertarian Vote Amid Jeers And Heckling"It's time to be winners," said Trump when asked rhetorically if third-party delegates wanted to go on getting single-digit protest votes. "I'm asking for the Libertarian Party's endorsement, or at least lots of your votes." He also vowed to "put a Libertarian in my cabinet."Despite the promises, Trump elicited continuous boos and heckling from the crowd throughout his speech, suggesting the Ulbricht pardon and a cabinet post were not quite enough.Trump's own supporters were outnumbered by Libertarian delegates who seemed to resent his presence.A chant of "We Want Trump" was quickly drowned out by "End the Fed!" When Trump called Joe Biden a "threat to democracy," some delegates shouted, "So are you!"Photo: Shutterstock

Trader Predicts One Red-Hot Memecoin Dethroning Shiba Inu and Becoming 13th-Largest Crypto by Market Cap - The Daily Hodl


								A trader known for making timely crypto market calls thinks that one surging memecoin is poised to more than double its valuation.
Early last week, pseudonymous analyst Hsaka told his 554,600 followers on the social media platform X that he believes frog-themed memecoin Pepe (PEPE) will soar in market cap en route to dethroning its rival Shiba Inu (SHIB).










At the time, PEPE was the 28th-largest crypto by market cap.
Source: Hsaka/X
Since then, the Ethereum (ETH)-based memecoin has been on a tear, rallying by about 71% in a matter of days. Hsaka shares another chart showing that PEPE has leapfrogged six other crypto assets in terms of market cap rankings.


“Update: the climb to the top continues.”



Source: Hsaka/X
Hsaka is not the only crypto strategist bullish on PEPE. Fellow analyst Kaleo tells his 640,600 followers on the social media platform X that it is within the realm of possibility for PEPE to witness massive gains in this bull market based on the performance of SHIB and Dogecoin (DOGE) last cycle.
“PEPE is only at a $6 billion market cap. DOGE hit a max market cap of $75 billion last cycle, and SHIB hit nearly $50 billion. I think it’s safe to say there’s still plenty of upside for the frog.”

At time of writing, PEPE is worth $0.0000152, up about 7% in the past 24 hours.

Santiment Reveals the Top 10 Altcoins Developers Are Focusing on on the BNB Chain Network: First Ranking is Unexpected - Bitcoin Sistemi


In its statement, cryptocurrency analysis company Santiment shared an evaluation of the altcoins that developers focus on the most on BNB Chain, supported by Binance.
Santiment analysts based the evaluation on the Github pages of altcoin projects. Code contributions made by developers to the altcoins in question were used to create the developer score.


Here are the altcoins and developer scores that developers have focused on the most in the last 30 days on the BNB Chain network:

Bitcoin BEP2 (BTCB) – 112.73
Dusk (DUSK) – 42.73
Flux (FLUX) – 22.6
Trust Wallet Token (TWT) – 22.1
Beefy.Finance (BIFI) – 20.23
Zigcoin (ZIG) – 16.27
ApeSwap Finance (BANANA) – 15.1
Saito (SAITO) – 11.27
TokenPocket (TPT) – 8.43
0x (ZRX) – 4.07


BTCB, which ranks first on the list, can actually be defined as the BTCs in the Bitcoin network bridged to BNB Chain. Users obtain BTCB on the BNB Chain network by locking their Bitcoins on a bridge, and this token is thus traded at the same price as BTC. Users who want to return to the Bitcoin network get their BTC back by burning BTCB tokens on the bridge.

Unique Bitcoin Course to Be Launched by Swiss University


The University of Applied Sciences in Business Administration Zurich will be offering a unique Bitcoin course starting in March 2025, according to a recent report by 20 Minuten, a local media outlet.  The course is specifically aimed at those who want to integrate Bitcoin into new business models. The training course, which offers 15 ECTS credits, will cost a whopping 9,950 francs ($10,794) for just 16 days.  The course offers a structured modular curriculum that takes into consideration various aspects of the Bitcoin ecosystem. It includes basic economic principles behind the flagship cryptocurrency as well as an analysis of the cryptocurrency's impact on the broader economy. The second part dissects the technical aspects of Bitcoin and blockchain technology. The next part focuses on the current state of Bitcoin regulation as well as compliance issues. The fourth part takes an in-depth look at various wealth management strategies that are specifically tailored for Bitcoin. There is also a comparable analysis of Bitcoin and altcoins. Its aim is to explain what makes the largest cryptocurrency stand out among the plethora of other digital assets. Finally, the last part will explore specific business models and opportunities offered by Bitcoin. The report says that the yet-to-be-launched Bitcoin course is unique in all of Europe. Bitcoiners, however, do not appear to be excited. Most commentators have taken issue with the exorbitant price of the course. One Bitcoin wrote that he would rather invest that money in the cryptocurrency while engaging in self-teaching.

Why Donald Trump Will Pump Crypto: Mad Crypto Alpha With Ivan - Benzinga

gm,I’m Ivan and welcome to my weekly column Mad Crypto Alpha.In this week’s issue: why this guy is crypto’s biggest key opinion leader (aka shill).You May Not Like Him, But Your Crypto Net Worth Is In The Hands Of This ManYou have to give it to Donald Trump.His 180 on crypto is impressive even by his standards. How it started: How it’s going:I predicted this, although the speed and intensity of the pivot surprised me too.Trump has all the attributes I want from a successful crypto shill key opinion leader.
Like any good crypto influencer, Trump is able to “update his beliefs” fast when necessary. 



He loves attention, another key trait for a successful crypto KOL. A Lambo is nice, but have you tried putting your own name on an airplane and a tower?



He likes to create a narrative and then take credit for stuff he is, at best, partially responsible for.
The narrative alone could (and in my opinion should) be enough to pump the crypto markets going into November. Oh but wait, there is more.Read Next: Ethereum ETF Approved, Elon Musk Mourns Kabosu's Death, Trump Embraces Crypto Donations And More: Top Cryptocurrency UpdatesYour Turn, Democratic PartyLet’s remember that about a week ago, the chances of the spot Ethereum ETH/USD ETFs happening were about 10%. Proof:Then Trump started shilling crypto and, surprise surprise, not only do ETH ETFs get approved (with the SEC refusing to elaborate further), but also the FIT21 “crypto bill” passes the House.Coincidence?Maybe. And for the record, the bill isn’t (to my knowledge) passing the Senate anytime soon, but this is a surprising and sudden shift in sentiment and hard facts as far as crypto policy goes.An unexpected love story, right in front of our eyes.And Trump, directly or indirectly, probably contributed to this by vocally embracing cryptocurrency.Let’s face it: crypto will not be a top 10 election issue (see here). But it’s also not worth alienating a passionate and wealthy minority over. In Trump, the crypto lobby found the perfect person to advance its interests. Someone who doesn’t fundamentally care about its potential or risks but likes number going up and is happy to embrace a fundamentally unimportant topic for votes.Still not convinced?See Also: Was Cathie Wood Right About Crypto As An Issue In 2024 White House Race? ‘You Can’t Be On The Wrong SideHow The Trump Pump Could HappenWill the next president try to cut spending and be fiscally responsible?Could the next president, by accident or by design, preside over a recession that necessitates a bit of, y’know, monetary stimulus?You bet.Would Donald Trump specifically like to pump the markets and actively try to make that happen?Well…Fed Chair Jerome Powell himself has said that the U.S. is “on an unsustainable fiscal path.”That means the flight of capital into assets — stocks, real estate and crypto — is likely to continue.In my humble opinion, under a President Trump, it would accelerate (more) than under a President Biden II.None of this is financial advice, but if you asked me whether a candidate that accepts donations in, *checks notes*, Dogecoin DOGE/USD and Shiba Inu SHIB/USD is bullish for crypto…….I would not have to think twice.Wrapping It UpIf you liked this column, give me a follow on Twitter and sign up to our "Future of Finance" newsletter.Shoot me a DM or Benzinga a mail if you have topic requests, and I'll see you back for next week's Mad Crypto Alpha.gnRead Next: EXCLUSIVE: Trump-Themed MAGA Memecoin Plans To Rival Dogecoin And Shiba Inu With ‘Four More Years Of Catalysts’Image created using artificial intelligence with Midjourney.

Michael Saylor Shifts Stance on Ether ETFs, Sees Approval as Positive for Bitcoin



                    

MicroStrategy founder Michael Saylor has recently shifted his stance on spot Ether exchange-traded funds (ETFs), suggesting that the U.S. regulator’s recent approval is beneficial for Bitcoin as well.



“Is this good for Bitcoin or not? Yeah, I think it’s good for Bitcoin, in fact, I think it may be better for Bitcoin because I think that we are politically much more powerful supported by the entire crypto industry,” Saylor told Bitcoin podcaster Peter McCormack on the May 25 episode of the What Bitcoin Did podcast.




“They serve as another line of defense for Bitcoin,” he continued, following the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission’s (SEC) approval of eight spot Ether ETFs on May 23.



Saylor emphasized that this move will “accelerate institutional adoption,” as previously hesitant investors will now see crypto as a legitimate asset class. 



He explained that while capital will be allocated across various crypto assets, Bitcoin will receive the majority, being “the leader” of cryptocurrencies.




“I think mainstream investors will say oh there is a crypto asset class now, maybe we’ll allocate 5% or 10% to the crypto asset class, but Bitcoin will be 60% or 70% of that,” he claimed.

Saylor acknowledged his change in perspective on spot Ether ETFs, having previously believed there was little chance of SEC approval.



“Two weeks before, the world looked like Bitcoin was going to be the only asset securitized and offered as a spot ETF by the Wall Street establishment and it was going to spread as the one legitimate crypto asset,” he explained.




Earlier, on May 3, Cointelegraph reported Saylor’s prediction that the SEC would classify ETH as a security, along with BNB, Solana, XRP, and Cardano.



“None of [these tokens] will ever be wrapped by a spot ETF, none of them will be accepted by Wall Street, none of them will be accepted by mainstream institutional investors as crypto assets,” said Saylor.



Saylor’s revised stance on the What Bitcoin Did podcast drew attention from the crypto community.



“Changing his tune a bit,” Bitcoin commercial litigator Joe Carlasare commented in a May 25 X post.



“Is the next step Saylor buying ETH? That’s a serious 180,” added crypto analyst Ricky Bobbyy.

How Much ETH Will Spot Ethereum ETFs Buy? Will Bitcoin's Performance Be Seen? Bloomberg Analysts Explained - Bitcoin Sistemi


Bloomberg ETF analysts James Seyffart and Eric Balchunas expressed optimism about the potential demand for spot Ethereum ETFs.
In an interview hosted by Bitwise, Seyffart stated that he expects Ethereum ETFs to see 20% to 25% of the demand experienced by spot Bitcoin ETFs. Balchunas estimates that demand will be around 15% to 20%.


Seyffart's estimate, which he calls a “discount,” is based on the fact that Ethereum's market cap is about 30% of Bitcoin's $1.4 trillion market cap. He attributes the difference in demand to the limitations of each product. Unlike Ethereum holders, Ethereum ETF investors will not be able to stake to generate returns. Additionally, Ethereum's advanced on-chain services will not be accessible to ETF investors.

“The gap between Ethereum within an ETF and Ethereum itself is slightly wider than the gap between Bitcoin within the ETF and the actual Bitcoin,” Seyffart said.





Seyffart also noted that Ethereum futures ETFs, which currently hold only 12% of assets compared to U.S. futures ETFs, do not provide a “good proxy” for a prediction. However, Ethereum futures ETFs in foreign markets hold 20% to 30% of assets commensurate with Bitcoin futures ETFs.
Despite these limitations, Seyffart predicts spot Ethereum ETFs will have “major launches,” though not as large as spot Bitcoin ETF launches. “There will be demand,” he concluded.

Wells Fargo Freezes 92 Year-Old Man’s Bank Account Without Notice, Triggering Eight Month Battle To Withdraw His Money: Report - The Daily Hodl


								A 92 year-old man who recently lost his “true love” says Wells Fargo abruptly froze his account, triggering an eight month battle to access his cash.
Frank W. Pfluger says he discovered Wells Fargo locked him out of his bank account just weeks after losing his wife of 67 years in September, reports NBC10 Philadelphia.










Frank says he was trying to withdraw a few hundred dollars from his account, but the lender unexpectedly blocked him from accessing his funds.
“There should have been close to $2,000 or $2,500 in it and the ATM popped up and said ‘Insufficient Funds’.” 
The account in question is a joint account between Frank and his late wife Miriam. Frank says Wells Fargo had no legal basis to freeze the joint account even though his wife had passed away.
“We could never get a straight answer as to why they had bothered to freeze the account because it was a joint account with rights of survivorship.” 
Frank says Wells Fargo asked him to complete a letter of authorization, which he did four times between November 28th, 2023, and January 4th, 2024.
On April 1st, Frank received a letter from Wells Fargo saying that “the Estate process has been completed and the funds are available to withdraw… either at a Wells Fargo bank branch or online money movement.”
But even with the notice, Frank still could not access or withdraw his money. At that point, he reached out to NBC10.
The media outlet approached Wells Fargo to inquire about Frank’s case. Within days, Wells Fargo issued a statement saying “We are happy to have resolved the matter for the customer.”
When pressed for more details, a Wells Fargo spokesperson directed NBC10 to a part of its website that explains what happens to a joint account when a loved one passes.
“Most of these bank accounts carry automatic rights of survivorship, which means the joint owner will have full access to the funds.” 
Within 10 days of seeking media intervention, Frank says he received a check from Wells Fargo amounting to $1,993.91.

Bitcoin Nears $69,000 as Key Resistance Levels Hold Steady



                    

Bitcoin stayed near key price levels into the May 26 weekly close, with weekend trading centering around $69,000.



Data from Cointelegraph Markets Pro and TradingView showed a strong performance by BTC/USD, which briefly surpassed $69,500 before consolidating.




Despite some market predictions for a weekend upside, resistance zones kept gains in check.



“As price is ranging around ~$69K, there’s some liquidity building up on both sides,” noted popular trader Daan Crypto Trades in his latest analysis on X (formerly Twitter). 



“Most notably: $68.3K & $69.8K. Good levels to watch in the short term going into next week.”




An accompanying chart highlighted liquidity concentrations for the BTC/USDT perpetual swaps pair on Binance, the largest global exchange.



Across BTC order books, liquidity was increasing around the spot price, leading to lower volatility but raising the chances of a liquidity raid later.



Keith Alan, co-founder of trading resource Material Indicators, emphasized the importance of turning $69,000 into support.

“Bitcoin lost $69k again. It’s our strongest and most important resistance level on the chart,” he stated in his latest X post. “I’d like to see a weekly close above $69k to gain some confidence in a measured move to $73k.”



Alan noted that U.S. markets would be closed on May 27 for the Memorial Day holiday.



Regarding resistance, popular trader and analyst Rekt Capital focused on levels above $71,000. Updating X subscribers on BTC price action after the April block subsidy halving, he confirmed that the market had exited the “danger zone” typically seen after such events. However, he warned that bulls are not entirely out of trouble.



“Since the Bitcoin Post-Halving ‘Danger Zone’ ended, Bitcoin broke out to $71500. 



“However, ~$71500 is where the Range High resistance of the Macro Re-Accumulation Range is and this is where Bitcoin rejected from,” Rekt Capital explained.



“The consolidation continues, and history suggests it will continue for several more weeks between $60000 and $70000.”



If this happens, the May monthly close could still end in the red, aligning with the trend of the past three years, according to data from monitoring resource CoinGlass.

US Government Pays $514,000,000,000 in Interest on National Debt in Seven Months, Surpassing Defense and Medicare Costs: Report - The Daily Hodl


								The US government just spent over half a trillion dollars in interest payments on its national debt in a mere seven months.
The Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget (CRFB) reports that net spending on interest reached $514 billion in the first seven months of fiscal 2024 – more than what was spent on both national defense and Medicare.










The massive interest payments also surpass all the money that was spent on veterans, education and transportation combined.

As the national debt nears $34.8 trillion, the state of America’s balance sheet is garnering increasing scrutiny from the financial world.
In a new interview with Bloomberg, Goldman Sachs CEO David Solomon says political leaders must focus on the national debt and deficit, but he doesn’t think much will happen until after the election.
“I think the level of debt in the United States, the level of spending is something that we need a sharper focus on and more dialogue around than what we’ve seen. We obviously had a pandemic, we made a bunch of decisions in that pandemic, but we’re long out of that pandemic and the spending levels are continuing at a pace that I think is raising our debt level and creating issues for us down the road. 
So I think this is something that deserves a lot of attention. It’s not getting as much attention as I’d like to see it get right now. We’re obviously in an election year so I don’t have my head in the sand, I don’t think you’re going to see that get a lot of attention prior to the election but I do think it’s something that requires focus. We need to deal with the debt and the deficits, and hopefully, there will be a lot more discussions as we come through the election and move into the next administration.”

Will ​​Toncoin [TON] fall below $6 in the next 7 days? - AMBCrypto



Toncoin’s price declined by nearly 3% in the last 24 hours. 
Most metrics and market indicators looked bearish on TON.

Toncoin [TON] bears have dominated the market in the last week as the token’s price charts remained red.
 The recent downtick looked bearish as it pushed TON’s price down from a key resistance, which otherwise would have sparked a bull rally. 
Toncoin bears step up
CoinMarketCap’s data revealed that Toncoin bears clearly controlled the market, as the token’s price dropped by nearly 3% in the last 24 hours. 
At the time of writing, TON was trading at $6.31 with a market capitalization of over $21.9 billion.
While the token’s price turned bullish, it was consolidating in a bullish falling wedge pattern. 
World of Charts, a popular crypto analyst, posted a tweet highlighting this development as TON’s price was near the upper limit of the pattern. 
As per the tweet, a breakout from the pattern might kickstart a bull rally that would allow TON to surge by 25%. 
However, the current price trend suggests that TON might not manage to break above. Therefore, AMBCrypto analyzed Toncoin’s on-chain metrics to better understand which way the token was headed. 
What to expect from TON?
AMBCrypto’s analysis of Santiment’s data revealed that TON’s Exchange Inflow increased over the last week, indicating high selling pressure. 
The token’s Supply on Exchanges also dropped alongside its Velocity, further proving the fact that investors were selling TON.  This meant that TON was used less often in transactions within a set timeframe.
 Another bearish metric was the MVRV ratio, which registered a decline over the last few days. 
Source: Santiment
AMBCrypto’s look at TON’s daily chart revealed quite a few bearish indicators. For example, the Money Flow Index (MFI) registered a sharp downtick.
 The Relative Strength Index (RSI) also followed a similar declining trend. These technical indicators suggested that the chances of the bearish price trend continuing further were high. 
Source: TradingView
If this turns out to be true, then investors might witness TON to touch $5.9 in the coming days, as it has strong support there. A plummet under that could push the token’s value further down to $5.3–$5. 

Is your portfolio green? Check out the TON Profit Calculator.

Nonetheless, if a trend reversal happens and TON breaks above the falling wedge, then it can reach new highs. 
AMBCrypto reported earlier that there was a possibility of TON touching $10 in the coming days or weeks.

Biden BTC (BIDENBTC) Will Surge 11,000%, Looks to Challenge Shiba Inu and Dogecoin



                    

Biden BTC (BIDENBTC) could become a viral memecoin, like Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE).



Biden BTC (BIDENBTC), a Solana memecoin that was launched today, is aiming to challenge other memecoin giants, such as Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE).




Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Biden BTC presents a similar opportunity.



Biden BTC has a market cap below $15,000 at the moment, meaning that when it just reaches a modest market cap of $400,000-$800,000, early investors would generate returns of 2,000%-5,000% in a matter of days or hours.



The exciting memecoin is poised to rally 11,000% in the coming two days, and Biden BTC could potentially reach a multi-million dollar market cap within a few weeks.




Currently, Biden BTC can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jupiter and Raydium, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days.



To buy Biden BTC on these platforms, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Biden BTC by entering its contract address – 9MAph1jbrbs98UTvZ3EC5VVFAeKduh9iY78jJKDwxioz – in the receiving field.



In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price.



If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner.




The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum.



This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like BIDENBTC.

Normie Plunges 99% After Exploit on Base Network


Normie, a meme coin on Ethereum’s Layer 2 network Base, experienced a severe exploit, causing its token value to plummet by 99%.
The project’s team acknowledged the breach and agreed to the attacker’s proposal to return the stolen assets.
Normie’s Market Capitalization Free Falls

An attacker exploited a vulnerability in Normie’s contract tax mechanism, conducting a flash loan attack drastically increasing the meme coin’s token supply. This exploit caused a 99% drop in the token’s value while the market cap from approximately $41 million to around $1.3 million.
Lookonchain highlighted the severe impact on traders. The analyst noted that a trader whose $1.16 million investment in NORMIE is now worth less than $150. Similarly, many other token holders expressed their significant losses on the project’s official Telegram channel.
Meanwhile, crypto exchange LBank reported an influx of Normie token deposits, suggesting a connection to the exploit.

“We’ve noticed a large number of unusual NORMIE token deposits, possibly linked to an exploit. We urge the project team to contact us with details about the addresses involved and potential solutions,” LBank stated.

Interestingly, the attacker has offered to return 90% of the stolen assets if the project launched a new token to compensate affected holders.

In response, the Normie team accepted this proposal and assured there would be no reprisals. Additionally, the project stated that all the ETH in its development wallet would be committed to the recovery effort. On-chain data shows that the Normie developer wallet currently holds about 736 ETH, valued at approximately $11.7 million.

“Exploiter, we accept your offer to return 90% of the exploited ETH. You may keep 10%, no reprisals. All $ETH from the normie dev wallet will be used to rectify this situation and assist in our relaunch,” Normie’s team stated.

Normie is a memecoin launched on Base in March during the meme coin frenzy that swept the blockchain network following the introduction of the Dencun Upgrade, drastically reducing fees for Ethereum layer-2 networks. The project had enjoyed some early successes, reaching a market capitalization exceeding $100 million before this incident.

Solana Memecoin RIP DOGEY (RIPDOGEY) to Skyrocket 18,000% as KuCoin Listing Announced, While Shiba Inu and Dogecoin Struggle



                    

RIP DOGEY (RIPDOGEY) could turn early investors into multi-millionaires if it becomes a mainstream coin, like Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE).



RIP DOGEY (RIPDOGEY), a new Solana memecoin that was launched this week, is poised to explode over 18,000% in price in the coming days.




This is because RIPDOGEY has announced its first centralized exchange listing, which will be on KuCoin.



This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up.



Currently, RIP DOGEY can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jupiter and Raydium, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days.




Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and RIP DOGEY could become the next viral memecoin.



RIP DOGEY launched with over $6,000 of locked liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains.



To buy RIP DOGEY on Raydium or Jupiter ahead of the KuCoin listing, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for RIP DOGEY by entering its contract address – GVZoEtPFj1fMuW2zA4Zww27Mcx1yJSobrW3hzp5hfqCe – in the receiving field.



In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price.




If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner.

Crypto Exchange Coinbase Adds Bitcoin Ecosystem Altcoin to Its Listing Roadmap - The Daily Hodl


								Coinbase, the largest crypto exchange in the US, has announced the potential future listing of an altcoin within the Bitcoin (BTC) scaling ecosystem.
The exchange announced that Core (CORE) is now on its listing roadmap, meaning the exchange will possibly list it for trading in the future.










Core is designed to be a hyper-scalable complimentary smart contract platform to Bitcoin.
Core’s ecosystem consists of several major components, including its Satoshi Plus consensus mechanism, its non-custodial staking and its native version of wrapped Bitcoin.
CORE currently has a market cap of $1.96 billion and a fully diluted valuation of $4.64 billion.
Crypto analyst Altcoin Sherpa says that CORE is one of his altcoin bets for the Bitcoin ecosystem looking ahead to the next big rally.
“CORE: temporary bottom looks in but would wait for a solid break of $2 before entering. One of my bets for BTC ecosystem plays this cycle, I think this goes to $2.50+ in the mid-term as long as BTC is stable”
Source: Altcoin Sherpa/X
Coinbase created its listing roadmap in 2022 to increase transparency and reduce the possibility of investors front-running new trading support announcements.
At time of writing, CORE is trading at $2.23.

Crypto news: il DEX Uniswap rivela gli asset in vista del voto

The decentralized crypto exchange (DEX) Uniswap reveals the assets in preparation for the vote on the fee mechanism. In the first quarter, the foundation allocated 4.34 million dollars to new grants and distributed 2.79 million dollars for already approved grants.
Let’s see all the details below. 

Vote on the commission mechanism: the statements of the crypto DEX Uniswap 
As anticipated, the Uniswap Foundation has communicated that it possesses 41.41 million dollars in fiat and stablecoin, in addition to 730,000 UNI tokens, at the end of the first quarter.
During this period, the foundation committed 4.34 million dollars in new grants and disbursed 2.79 million dollars for previously approved grants. 
Fiat cash and stablecoins are intended for lending activities and operations, while UNI tokens are reserved as employee rewards.
La Uniswap Foundation ha inoltre annunciato che il voto on-chain per una proposta che stabilisce il nuovo meccanismo di commissioni si terrà entro il 31 maggio. 
La proposta rappresenta un crucial step verso l’implementazione autonoma della riscossione e distribuzione delle commissioni nei pool Uniswap v3.
After the approval of the proposal, the control of the mainnet UniswapV3Factory will be transferred to a new contract V3FactoryOwner, marking an important progress in the decentralized governance of Uniswap. 
Tuttavia, il voto non attiverà le commissioni, che saranno affrontate in una futura proposta.
The Uniswap Foundation has stated that the change will be implemented despite the Wells notice received from the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). 
Quest’ultima ha accusato il protocollo DeFi di violazioni delle leggi sui titoli, operando come borsa valori e broker non registrati.
Uniswap Labs has responded by arguing that the SEC does not have jurisdiction to regulate their decentralized protocol according to current legal classifications.
The response from the company arrived promptly, coinciding with the vote of the United States House of Representatives on a bill, the Financial Innovation and Technology for the 21st Century Act.
Which could change the way the SEC and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) regulate criptovalute.
New proposals for the distribution of commissions and incentives to governance
As we know, since 2021, the SEC has been conducting an investigation into Uniswap Labs, the main developer of Uniswap. The decentralized exchange (DEX) has delisted several tokens from its platform due to increasing regulatory pressure.
So far, the commission revenues of Uniswap have been entirely allocated to the liquidity providers (LP). They earn rewards for providing assets to the platform, supporting trading activity and market liquidity.
The new proposal, however, provides for distributing the protocol fees among the token holders who stake or delegate their tokens. 
This would create a structure of incentives that rewards active engagement and encourages significant contributions within the Uniswap ecosystem.
A febbraio, la Uniswap Foundation ha avanzato una proposta per introdurre un sistema di ricompensa delle commissioni volto a incentivare i possessori di token UNI a impegnarsi più attivamente nelle decisioni di governance. 
Improving thus the participation of the community and the decision-making processes.
The +15% of UNI among positive developments on Ethereum and the legal battle with the SEC
In a week characterized by the consolidation of the cryptocurrency market, the UNI token of Uniswap defied the trend, recording an increase of over 15% and surpassing the 10 dollars.
This rise occurred in a context of positive developments within the Ethereum ecosystem and the ongoing legal battle between Uniswap and the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).
Beyond the legal dispute, the current momentum within the Ethereum ecosystem is pushing the price of UNI upwards. On-chain data shows significant whale withdrawals from cryptocurrency exchanges following the news of a potential spot ETF on Ethereum. 
This search for security, along with the general bull sentiment on Ethereum, is benefiting UNI, a key player in the Ethereum DeFi landscape.
From a technical standpoint, the breakout of UNI from a monthly consolidation phase paints a promising picture. Technical indicators and on-chain data suggest a potential increase of 25% in the price of UNI. 
The recent surge of the token indicates a possible bull run, with analysts targeting a price goal of 12.80 dollars if the current momentum continues.
Supporting this forecast is the Age Consumed index by Santiment, which measures the movement of dormant tokens. The peaks of this index often precede price rallies and the latest rise at the end of April seems to have foreshadowed the current bull trend of UNI. 
Questo parametro on-chain rafforza le prospettive bull per UNI, suggerendo che gli investitori stanno riconoscendo il suo potenziale.

                        The Russian Central Bank says it has noticed a significant rise in citizens’ transactions on crypto exchanges and peer-to-peer crypto trading platforms.Per the Russian media outlet RBC, the bank has published a financial stability report, making several observations on Russian citizens’ crypto transactions.The bank wrote about trends it had noticed from the fourth quarter of the Financial Year 2023 to the first quarter of FY2024.The regulator wrote that the “total web traffic of Russian users on the websites of the largest cryptocurrency platforms” increased by 16.4% “compared to the second and third quarters of 2023.”Russian Central Bank: Citizens More Active on Crypto Platforms
The bank said that Russians made a total of 104.6 million visits to crypto exchanges and P2P sites.The average monthly number of unique Russian IP address-holders to “major crypto exchanges” also increased by 15.1%, the bank said.This means that 7% of all the traffic on these major overseas crypto exchanges originates from Russia, the bank added.However, this is still short of the 9% peak the bank reported in the first quarter of FY2023.The bank said it had used a tool named Transparent Blockchain to make its calculations.The tool was developed by the Federal Financial Monitoring Service (aka Rosfinmonitoring), in a bid to fight crypto-powered money laundering.Russian officials claim Transparent Blockchain lets them identify the “true” identity of crypto users on multiple blockchain protocols.The report suggests that Russians remain keen on higher-cap cryptoassets like Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH). They also appear to use USD-pegged stablecoins like USDT and USDC.In total, transactions “potentially attributable” to Russians amounted to over $50.2 billion in the same period.This, analysts noted, includes not only crypto trades, but also P2P payments, remittances, and “payments for goods and services.”Crypto Is Risky, Regulator Warns
RBC noted that the Russian Central Bank report “does not publish a list of the crypto platforms it has monitored.”However, it added that “previous Central Bank financial risk reports” have included data from platforms such as Binance, Bybit, MEXC, KuCoin, and others.Part of the reason for the spike in transactions may be due to Binance’s exit from the Russian market.The bank thinks that at the time of its exit from Russia, Binance had cornered just short of half of the nation’s crypto market.And the bank further warned Russian crypto users of the “dangers” and risks” involved with holding crypto in Russia.It wrote that it was “necessary to assess the risks associated with possible sanctions from unfriendly countries.”It claimed that, with tensions rising between the West and Moscow, Russian USDT and USDC holders risk “loss of access to their funds.”The bank said that such losses “cannot be ruled out if [Russians] are blocked by stablecoin issuers.”RBC noted that in the US and UK, regulators are increasing their scrutiny of “transactions with stablecoins,” as “control over crypto exchanges is being tightened.”The bank further warned that governments of “unfriendly nations” could order crypto exchanges to “strengthen control over user transactions, including within the framework of sanctions restrictions.”But in its “recommendations” for Russian “financial organizations,” the bank hinted at forthcoming Russian regulations.The bank “recommended” that domestic financial providers should “not offer financial instruments tied to cryptoassets.”It also advised banks “not to advertise services related to the circulation of cryptoassets.”

Bitcoin White Paper Reuploaded to Bitcoin.org After Craig Wright's Failed Satoshi Claim



                    

The Bitcoin white paper has been reuploaded to the Bitcoin.org website following Craig Wright’s failed court attempt to prove he is Satoshi Nakamoto, the protocol’s pseudonymous creator.



Hennadii Stepanov, the maintainer of Bitcoin.org, announced the return of the Bitcoin white paper by sharing a link to the PDF on platform X.




Due to legal constraints, Bitcoin.org had to restrict access to the white paper for UK-based users. 



Instead, it displayed a poignant quote from Satoshi Nakamoto: “It takes advantage of the nature of information being easy to spread but hard to stifle.”



In 2021, Wright successfully sued Cobra, the anonymous group running the website, for copyright infringement, leading to the removal of the white paper PDF. 




Wright won by default after Cobra chose not to defend the case, resulting in Cobra paying £35,000 ($40,100) of Wright’s legal fees. Wright had filed for U.S. copyright registration for the Bitcoin white paper in 2019.



In 2023, Wright sued 13 Bitcoin Core developers and companies including Blockstream, Coinbase, and Block, for copyright violations related to the Bitcoin white paper, its file format, and database rights to the Bitcoin blockchain.



The Bitcoin Legal Defense Fund responded, emphasizing the trend of abusive lawsuits against prominent Bitcoin contributors.

According to the defense fund, these lawsuits deter development due to the associated time, stress, expenses, and legal risks.



However, Wright’s copyright win is now invalid, as his claims of being Satoshi Nakamoto and authoring the white paper have been decisively debunked. 



The detailed ruling came from a case brought against Wright by the Crypto Open Patent Alliance (COPA), a coalition of prominent companies seeking to prevent Wright from asserting ownership over Bitcoin’s core intellectual property.



COPA alleged that Wright engaged in an elaborate scheme of forgery and deceit to fabricate evidence backing his claim of being Nakamoto. 



Consequently, Craig Wright’s assets, worth 6.7 million British pounds ($8.4 million), were frozen after a UK court approved a plan to prevent him from evading court expenses.



The Bitcoin white paper is now subject to an MIT open-source license, allowing anyone to reuse and modify the code for any purpose.

Lower Cost Bitcoin Miners Increase Market Share After Halving: Bernstein Analysts ⋆ ZyCrypto


            
            
Advertisement

&nbsp

&nbsp
In a dramatic turn for the Bitcoin mining industry, a big drop in Bitcoin’s mining difficulty has paved the way for lower-cost miners to grab a larger market pie. This significant shift, the most substantial since the crypto winter of 2022, is reshaping the competitive landscape and highlighting the critical role of operational efficiency in the mining sector.



A recent report from brokerage firm Bernstein delves into this fascinating trend, exploring how key players leverage these changes and the implications for the broader cryptocurrency market.



Bitcoin Mining Difficulty Plummets



Bitcoin mining difficulty, a measure of how hard it is to mine new Bitcoins, recently experienced a noteworthy 6% decline. This significant drop indicates miners need fewer computational resources to mine new Bitcoin, which has wide-ranging effects across the mining sector.



According to data, Bitcoin mining difficulty declined 6% on May 10, from 88.1 trillion hashes to 83.15 trillion hashes. This is the most significant percentage decrease since July 2021, when it fell by 28% to 14.36 trillion hashes. The mining difficulty metric adjusts automatically to accommodate fluctuations in the Bitcoin network’s total computing power.



One of the most striking outcomes of the decline in mining difficulty is the surge in market share for lower-cost miners. Bernstein’s report highlights how miners with lower operational costs have rapidly expanded their presence since the Bitcoin halving event.

&nbsp



Last month, Bitcoin went through its fourth halving event. This occurrence, which happens roughly every four years, slashed the rewards miners receive for processing new blocks on the network by half, from 6.25 BTC to 3.125 BTC per block.



Bitcoin miners, who create new coins and ensure the network runs smoothly by processing transactions, now face a tougher challenge to stay profitable. Reduced rewards and increased mining difficulty have led many miners to shut down their operations.



Impact on Mining Giants



Mining giants like Riot Platforms (RIOT) and CleanSpark (CLSK) have emerged as frontrunners due to the decline in mining difficulty. These companies, known for their streamlined operations and robust financial positions, have witnessed a surge in market share as higher-cost competitors struggle to stay afloat.



Bernstein’s analysis suggests that these companies are poised to capitalize on the evolving dynamics of the Bitcoin mining sector.



Despite recent challenges, Bernstein remains bullish about the future of Bitcoin mining. The firm predicts that Bitcoin’s price will remain steady in the short term but anticipates an upward surge once spot exchange-traded funds (ETFs) attract more attention from institutional investors.



This forecast indicates promising investment opportunities in Bitcoin mining firms, particularly those with efficient operations and solid financial footing.
